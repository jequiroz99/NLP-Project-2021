get your walk on,"(Yeah) I can drink a whole Henessey fifth. Some call that a problem but I call it a gift. Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah). Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory. A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct. Bitch niggaz continue to floss and lip-sync. And I'ma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat. Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope. Don't make my desert eagle barrel touch the back of your throat. Always approach niggaz that's known for killin your folks. Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all. Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall. Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags. No retaliation you basically runnin with fags. In these streets, you only good as your last transaction. Funny style, and these niggaz ain't laughin. Y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero. Think life is a video for ""Last Action Heroes"". Face the price you pay for the games you play. When it's all said and done at the end of the day, you gotta. [Chorus - repeat 2X]. Get your walk on, get your head right. I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right. Get your bounce on, back dat ass up. Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up. [Xzibit]. Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed. When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift. Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock. Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop. It's the best thing crackin my nigga. Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver. From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags. earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas. Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah). You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah). Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket. Mailed your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid. Drastic measures we take just to get by. for all the shit you gotta go through to get high. Stand by, do or die for the West coast. Wanna fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Tell y'all people to call my people. Recognize all men are not created equal. I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through. Only the kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!). When I get through the world'll be a better place. A little Jesus Christ mixed with some Leatherface. Go find some punch to spike, find some dope to lace. Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space. Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit. or hit so hard to the chin it make your back flip. My transcript number one up in this conference. It's nonsense, all y'all niggaz want is conflict. Only associate with pros and the convicts. Xzibit roll up in the spot with a bomb bitch. and then bounce with a couple, motherfuck a tussle. You never have enough muscle to stop a nigga hustle. [Chorus - 2X]."
symphony in x major,"(feat. Dr. Dre). [Xzibit]. Time to snap out of it, welcome to the real world. My life like a Hitchcock flick, stick to the script. If she can't stick to the script, stick to this dick. How she actin off of the fifth? Ridiculous shit. We don't need conversation, just crowd participation. If you here on vacation we got, rules and regulations. Seperate myself from y'all, segregation. Tryin to stop Xzibit and Dre? Humiliation. Pure elevation, got me some inspiration. Two bitches in bubble baths, a beautiful invitation. Got a live occupation, live for the moment. I'm faced with an altercation manhandlin my opponents. I got eyes in the back of my head. I never sleep so they bloodshot red. Yo we so far ahead of our time. If we can stop life and press rewind. You still wouldn't catch up 'til 2K and a dime, so turn it up. [Chorus - female and male singers]. [F] Turn it up!. [M] Turn it up. [F] This is it!. [M] This is it. [F] We the shit. [M] We the shiiiiiiiiiit. [F] Get with it!. [F] Give a fuck. [M] Give a fuck.

So I had to come down and pass around some help. From N.W.A to whatever's next. Make sure it says ANDRE YOUNG in bold letters on big checks. Your shit ain't sellin? Fuck it, get Dr. Dre on it. You got a budget? I'll get down, give me half of it. One session, one song, I'm gone. The first week, you hit the streets, a star is born. to add to my universe - let me show you. who can invade who nigga, and who can do who the worst. Warning from the Surgeon General. Watch out for fake hits and bullshit that sounds identical. Pick it up, read the credits, who you thought it was?. Twenty years in the game, with a constant buzz. Pick a year, any year, see how hot I was. Same shit today, and still don't give a fuck!. [Chorus]. [Chorus 2]. [M] Stay.. in your place. [X] Stay in your place nigga.

[M] And get high for meeeeeeee. [Xzibit]. Let me give y'all niggaz somethin to hold. This product not to be sold. Know you can't cook it over a stove. You can flip it and come back with a mitt. Don't make me reach through your limo tint. I just want my twenty percent. This is dedicated to the people that spoke too soon. I think I'll stop shootin you niggaz and shoot for the moon. Motherfuckers turn respect on and off like a light switch. I'll never be seen, like Farrakhan fuckin a white bitch. Jump I won't flinch, dump I don't miss. X holdin this, I'm never losin faith or focus. So say what you gotta say, every day a holiday. We don't blow the roof, we blow the whole fuckin spot away [BOOM]. Organize permission like, organized crime. Organized minds, organize they nickels and dimes. Organized vocab be organizing my rhymes. Organizing my business and organizing my time, so turn it up.

alkaholic,"Alcoholic. [X]. Cmon. [E]. Xzibit!. [X]. Yeah... [E]. Ahh.... E-Dub. [Xzibit]. It's that millenium ridiculous flow, I never let go. Niggaz gettin knocked out is part of my show. Let em know who they fuckn wit yo: a rhyme wrangler. Tri-angular, push off the hillside strangler. Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony. Now let his punk ass go, look out below (BELOWWWW). It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down. We officially not fuckin around. Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box. (hah!) with my fresh pressed khakis in a slingshot. So heatbox all day in a nigga face. And all you bitches see the dick that you shoulda ate. [Chorus: Xzibit]. Call it what you wanna call it. I'm a fuckin Alkaholik. Bring it if you really want it. Ain't gotta put no extras on it. Call it what you wanna call it. I'm a fuckin Alkaholik. Bring it if you realli want it. Ain't gonna put no extras on it. [Erick Sermon]. Yo, I'm in the zone, and lyrically gone. Got the spot blown, BOOM! Oklahoma. Watch the aroma, catch those who love me. My underground dirty cats on dune buggies. I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it. Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it. Yo, I bang a nigga head til his neck pop. Do a KR's one to a black cop. X and E's, out for cream, get the money. While you stay broker than Al Bundy. Uhh, give it to yall, in Any Given Sunday. With J. Fox namin tha spot, make it hot. (I hate E so much right now!) Blow it down nigga, bounce. come off the ropes like J. Snooka. (Two fly motherfuckers) You can't fuck widdit. Backed by Open Bar, so y'all forget it. [Chorus]. [J-Ro]. J McEnroe, cam smashin, party crashin. I eat MC's like a ration. I'm sockin niggaz in their goatees. I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies. I'm in the room with 10 G's, countin ten G's. Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell it?). Now we need ten dimes, to blow on these like wind chimes. Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines. I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it. Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot. You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance. You underground, we under water drinkin liquid by tha gallons. [Tash]. Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin, head rushin. Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches. and still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it. Forget it, it's liquid, no listen, Xzibit. Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle. I slap bitches on the ass, I slap pimps about the muzzle. I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistant. You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin difference. For instance, 21 and over, set your clocks back. (Tick tock tick tock) Still standin where the rocks at. Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's restless. (Thirty niggaz, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin guestlist. [Chorus]."

foundation,"Verse 1:. When I look you in your eyes I can see my own. Straight love manifested in flesh and bone. You's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit. You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget. Hit back when hit. Use force that's effective. All these bitches and women. Son, please be selective. This is California can't stick your dick in everything. We will survive necessarily by any means. Let no man ever hold you down or supress you. It's the 90's the police just arrest you,. disrespect you on occasion take life. By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight. It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us. When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust. In God we trust but just incase keep it loaded and locked. Ready to rock. Then shake the spot. The Foundation. Verse 2:. You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers. Who forever smoke bud. So it's probably in your blood. Realize you can only run the streets so long. Then the streets run you into the ground then gone. It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong. Same shit different day. It's the same ol' song. If the time ever comes that I meet my match. Take control of my assets. Fuck startin' from scratch. Take care of your mother. Keep yourself on track. Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back. Beware of the serpent. Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike. And try to make you loose sight. Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real. Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill. Son if you ever pull heat. Then use it. If you got a chance to walk away. Then do it. Total domination takes full concentration in all situations. A solid foundation. Verse 3:. You are the foundation. Begining of a new generation. I remember hospital hallway pacin'. I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine. Only to find that yours looked like mine. So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time. In this life you can't press stop. Then press rewind. Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man. Have your own plan, expand your mind. Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs. This is nothing but love. Via sattelite Muggs. Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life. Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife. Be prepared for the worst. But expect the best. No matter where life takes you. Come home to the West. Survival takes more than just gats and guns. That's words to live by. From a father to a son. Foundation."

I try to bite my own verses. Cause the purpose of my flow. Is to let you know. My style is badder than the water. Down in Mexico. Cause RICO blend styles liek juice and gin. I got the Likwit shit. That have you seein' double. Like the Twins. Hook."
don't approach me,"[X] Pssh, man I need a lighter man. [E] Right here. [X] Yeahhh.. whassup Slim?. [E] What's crackin?. [X] Hit this shit. [E] Ssshhit I almost hit this motherfucker today. [X] Psh, is that right?. [E] What is it with motherfuckers thinkin that... [E] {*SIGH*} because we're in the spotlight or whatever that... [E] they can do or say whatever they want to us. [E] and that we won't retaliate. [X] Protect my motherfuckin self, by ANY. [both] MEANS, NECESSARY. [E] Right?. [Chorus 2X: Eminem]. Cause you don't know me, I don't know you. So don't approach me, I won't approach you. And don't insult me, I won't insult you. Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do. [Xzibit]. Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight. Bein underrated gave me time to create it. Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate. Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate. Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate. Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face. No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows. You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home. But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me (yeah). Packed up, moved out, started a new family. So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up. marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?. FUCK THAT, this the fuckin thanks I get. for tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch. Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down). cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child. It's like... [Eminem]. .. everyday I wake up, another drama. It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma. If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer. I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her. without these cameras in our faces like animals. for your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue. and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts. and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence. And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun. whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one. No bullet, you're so full of shit. this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it. And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood. I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude. over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit. Don't tell me bout the show business shit. I know what this is, bitch. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. This ain't business, this is personal BITCH. You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed. I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit. Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th. Yo Em it's time to get serious with it (yeah). Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet. This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs. Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us. Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self. I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth. To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla. at the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones. Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel. Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin piano. Ridin slow through Cali like I'm ridin a camel. Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels. I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?. Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down. Spit lines to split spines just to get mine. Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine. Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope. Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin the soap. Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip. and turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit. [Eminem]. So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself. a front door with twelve locks. and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox. and everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?. Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots. and one in the chamber, gun in the waist. and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place. tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not. gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?. And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys. in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn. screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit. Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip. And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live. so my address ends up on the internet again. So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them. that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs. And reporters, blow it out of proportion. ""Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans. just for tryin to stand on his porch"". And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like ""Hey hi!. You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!"". Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle. and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you. It's not that I don't like you... .. it's just that I'm not behind the mic. I'm a person who's just like you."
(hit u) where it hurts,"[Xzibit]. Where Rock at?. Rock here yet?. It's all good. [Verse 1]. I done came too far, can't turn back now. Pull it out, get it up, can't put shit down. Best believe to achieve gotta struggle to get it but peep it. It's like you got a body somebody just to keep it. Ain't no secret how the west coast do it. Stick a fork in it, done deal disputed (yeah). Holdin two black aces for the smilin faces. It's a chess game nigga, better count ya spaces. We gon find the weakest link, fuck what you niggaz think. Pump gon repeat and grind y'all to mincemeat. I can't retreat, refusin to lose (yeah). Walk one day in the X man's shoes. [Chorus]. Make shit happen, stomp and smashin'. On and crackin, who want action. Pistol packin, fuck relaxin'. Hit u where it hurts. Make you feel it, can't conceal it. If it breaths then I can kill it. Come and get it, custom-fitted. Hit u where it hurts. [Verse 2]. I might as well buy a suit right now. Put money on my books downtown to get ready for trial. Look, ya only gotta tell me once. Better wake up and smell these blunts. What's really behind the front. Ain't no parts about me punk. We can thump, don't get too close. Because you might get slump kicked. Front page material, I serial kill shit. Only that real shit, we can scrap or slap clips. My tactics range from Attila the Hun. To Genghis Kahn to the rice fields of Vietnam. Atom bomb my name tag across the sky. Eye for an eye, somebody got to die now. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. The points that I make be hollow. X a hard act to follow. Disappear in front of your eyes, besides. I switch up rides at least five times. Dangerous minds, caught behind enemy lines. Read the signs, better yet you pick your place. Got a 4-4 eagle to split your face. Nigga you be safe we invade your space. Beat you, beat your team, then beat the case. Poker face, niggaz can't read me yo. Green light a mothafucker fa sho, let's go. Stay low, we the unforgiven. Hard to touch like pussy in Britain. Can't stop me from living, muh-fucka. [gunfire]."
1983 (feat. trena joiner),"[Intro]. I think we all have these moments in our life where we say. [Verse 1]. I had to write this in blood, because the ink wouldn't stick. I sold five to six million but, yo, that ain't really shit. It was supposed to be different, we were supposed to ride out,. But too much shot his girl, then shot himself in the mouth. Then the steady game form but very soon fell apart,. ?cause when you just doing all, with no the loyalty in your heart,. Slight catch a long hymn on all these niggers. forgetting where they're coming from. And they're slowing down, wait a minute,. what we're running from?. This what we're supposed to do,. here's where we're supposed to be,. I hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery. But that don't bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract. Small price to pay just to take a piece of my back. My back, backfire, assassination of my character,. Just demassing millions in the America. My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child,. My older brother served fifteen, he made it out. Even though my father loved me, I ain't seen him for a while. Had to fight my baby momma, bitch, give me my nigger now. ?cause he's running out of time and I need him to understand. The way a superior man had build a brand. Niggas talk about my taxes, had to pay to Uncle Sam. I'm surviving ?cause the lines ass crooked in the hand. [Verse 2]. Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine. I just wanted to join her. Now I miss to join her, you get to California,. I got something for you to do, it was like I was anointed. Resurrected, found my purpose. I remember meeting Dre,. being nervous when I would kick my verses. I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus. I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it. Got a call from Paul, told me shit isn't working. Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person. He probably told Em,. and by the way did he said it unapologetic twisted. made about him. I see Slim and he said he didn't recognize me. Was it that or did he let another man to find me?. I don't know, but now I gotta get this all behind me. Follow my calling when I used to follow niggers blindly. [Verse 3]. I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles. Blood relatives I could turn to when I'm feeling trouble. And talk about my struggles. My uncle John Nail, he only. put me on the phone with different females. And this is such a such, nephew, tell 'er, what's up?. Ain't even ask about your man in Cali, growing up. Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle. Self medicated numb, but I'mma feel it tomorrow. It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin. But now the pain is gone I got my second win. Only the strong live long, you better settle in. I'm fighting for ever, I will never let the devil win. 1983, that's when my journey begins. I searched every world for strength, only to find it within. This for me and my kid, still dying to live. Living life to the fullest 'till I see you again"

I'll reach the highest place in the house when I rock. like the Qu'ran, fuse hot, fluid with flavor like buillion cube. Been this way since I was fourteen. And like this I been runnin shit without the use of Sportscreme. Rippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay. I'm grim, I brim over my brow when I rip. Never write rhymes with slim fingertips. Each syllable you choose to use is light as a flower. Keep tryin to go gold. but all you're gettin is a golden shower. Chorus. [Xzibit]. Look, now if it wasn't for the West. These rap niggaz wouldn't need a vest around they chest. Keep bustin about where you rest, and what you own, and what you drive. So the day some niggaz come for you I'm really not surprised. Mr. Black Bruce Willis, please don't kill us. I show mercy like Kevorkian, like a scorpion. We sting you from behind and put it in you, so meet me at the venue. Put you on the spot to put you on the menu. Fricaseed emcee, we be the ones that keep the pussy hot. Xzibit livin life, like a bull inside a china shop. Strippin everything, see you ain't even got a dime to drop. Go ahead and call the cops, you ain't said nathin.

Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines. I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it. Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot. You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance. You underground, we under water drinkin liquid by tha gallons. [Tash]. Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin, head rushin. Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches. and still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it. Forget it, it's liquid, no listen, Xzibit. Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle. I slap bitches on the ass, I slap pimps about the muzzle. I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistant. You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin difference. For instance, 21 and over, set your clocks back. (Tick tock tick tock) Still standin where the rocks at. Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's restless. (Thirty niggaz, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin guestlist. [Chorus]."

back 2 the way it was,"Yeah.. yo.. c'mon. Ride wit me, lemme take you somewhere. [Xzibit]. My father was a soldier, my mother was a rider. I was born wit my fists balled up, I'ma fighter. Inspired, a real rhyme writer. Get past the past the future looks brighter. But, I wanna get it back to the way it was. Exchange blows, elbows and it was still love. A better time, better place in space. Cause nothin can erase, shame tat' like my nigga. Chase. Cause Bigga B will never be replaced, right. And I'ma scream it to the whole fuckin human race. Get a bar, get a taste. Enforce the muscle to ya hustle and ya did it with. grace. Cause real niggaz don't save face, they make. movements. Back to the time when hip-hop was music. When N.W.A. got booed at the Apollo. Broke ""Straight Outta Compton"" and the whole world. followed. Cause right now hip-hop is hollow. With no substance, X-Man with the roughness. Cause success can suck sometime. And many of us the way we act, we even lost our minds. [Chorus]. You can hold your breath, 'til your blue in the face. But you can never ever take my place. I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong. Through the struggle I will live on (now sing the song. wit me). You can speculate, on every breath I take. But you can never ever take my place. I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong. Through the struggle I will live on. [Xzibit]. Back to the day when Cooley was High. Hustle big like Butch in the Y-B-I. We did it 'n died, the gang still multiplied. Sock yo windpipe, cut yo air supply. Hypnotized, not by the glitz 'n glamour. So fuck them cameras, all I need is clips and hammers. The X-Man said that the first rhyme out. Were my fans worth my time? The first line out, so. Here we are eight years strong and still movin. Groovin with a reputation ya can't ruin. I wanna take it back how it used to be. Five thousand fucked up, rockin outta unity. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Was it the alcohol in you, the money the power the. fame. that made you actually attempt to try to disgrace my. name?. Played those games nigga when I was younger in life. 'Til I seen another man's life cut short with a knife. Lose teeth, cause beef, no peace with us. Ya can't hang, and ya sho' can't eat with us. When times get tough, the tough get rough and drastic. Never been blasted, never been an arrogant bastard. But I coulda been a lawyer, I shoulda been a doctor. I never been a actor, I'm nothin but a monster. I move in silence, speak with violence. Think with science, live free and walk with lions. Cats around me with gats like Yasser Arafat. It takes a nation of millions to hold me back. Pounds of cush to push what I'm talkin about. It's hard to talk the talk with a gauge in yo mouth. It's hard to walk the walk with ya back blew out. Don't let the things that you can't change stress you. out. Cause X take the money and run, and raise a man from a. son. And change the world with the power of one c'mon. [Chorus]. . Zéhh"
been a long time,"[Saafir as radio host]. Rrrah, uhh, bitch!. It's radio radio station, cat Xzibit huh?. K-W-Balls, Daniel Thompson hold like this. Like that in fact, with a fat-ass Battlecat track. I'm takin caller number one, that is... Rrrah uhh, bitch - you took too long. Caller number two like this... [Xzibit]. {*BZZT*} Bounce up out of the house close to midnight. Full rack up in the back {*BZZ BZZ*} shit is tight. Full charge and I'm out for somethin. Mass production, Battlecat bang percussion. End of discussion, hittin some corners, rearrange thangs. and brang change, we expand California. Listen - I lost more than I can ever gain back. from this road to riches, makin my heart turn black. So I'm cold to bitches, and I never call back. Plus I'm stoned and vicious, lay your whole hood flat. Get your, shit together nigga Big Snoop Dogg told me. 'Do music and leave that other shit alone homey'. We came from dust, the X-odus, the hard to touch. Y'all niggaz ain't fuckin with us, and plus. it ain't nothin like standin on your own two. So run them streets, but never let 'em run you. [Chorus: Nate Dogg]. Time is steady wastin, steady wastin. Since time won't wait for me, yeah, won't wait, won't wait. Just give me a beat that's bang, give me a beat that's bangin. I'll bust 'til I'm deceased, yeah, wooo-oooh, ooh-ooh-ooooh. [Xzibit]. Tune in, witness the rise of a icon. The python wrap around 'til your breath gone. The upper echelon, and I'm the cat you pull a weapon on. and wanna squeeze 'til my life is gone?. Back to the wall and trust nobody. Sippin Cognac with Kurupt, Young Gotti. Somebody gotta recognize this. Throw fo' fingers up, add a thumb, then make it a fist. Number one draft pick, lead the league in assists. Give a fuck how you decorate your neck and your wrists. You just settin yourself up for the twist (gimme that) it's like this. Only a few slide through like the Schindler's List. Who's the bitch, who's the mack, what's worse. the niggaz that bring in the coke or smoke the crack?. Metaphor figure four let it break your back (yeah). It's been a long time, where the gangstas at?. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Damn it feels good to be back in the saddle. On top of the game, crackin the frame, the heat of the battle. Been a long time comin but we waited. Xzibit went from bein hated, to makin the whole world say it. Give a fuck if the radio play it. Niggaz fall like the domino effect and you can't delay it. It ain't about who you are when you're makin your stack. It's the look that's on your face when you givin it back. So picture that. [Nate Dogg]. Time, keeps on slippin, slippin.. keeps on slippin away.. mm-hmm. My mind keeps on trippin, trippin.. trippin like ev-ery-day.. mm-hmm. [X] Yeah, it's been a long time. [Chorus]."
best of things,"[Xzibit]. I was voted most likely to have a psychiatric evaluation. Let's start the process of elimination. This dedication is for niggaz with the green buddha. The bandula, six-shooter to your suit coolers. Now how this feel? Cold black steel up in your grill. This hollow point lead gon' be your last meal. Say your prayers, say your graces. Pieces of your face is found in a hundred different places. Huh, so what we lookin like? We tryin to see some hoes to fuck tonight. and you just tryin to see the afterlife. Make a decision before we have a head-on collision. makin me spend the rest of my life in prison. See I can only play the cards I was given. Multiplication division whatever you got to break mines off. like the U.S. government did to Microsoft. Like Xzibit in some pussy with the lights turned off. It's like. [Chorus]. I'm just livin to fulfill my dreams. I'm just tryin to have the best of things. None of y'all can't take shit from me. Life's a bitch she ain't fuckin for free. So I'ma ride til the wheels fall off. while all the rest get weak and go soft. Your petite style, can get you beat down. My heat's loud, have you huggin on the street now. [Xzibit]. Niggaz keep askin me how does it feel. How does WHAT feel? Not havin to scrape for a meal?. Not bein locked down to a fucked up deal?. The biggest man in Los Angeles is not Shaquille. We had to reinvent the wheel, draft new blueprints. Made a whole album, spent HALF what you spent. then sent the rest to my people to invest wit it. Custom fitted, if you want it nigga, come and get it. and I suggest you bring a million niggaz runnin wit it. Split it, feel it, hit it it's hot, look. I ain't gon' stop til everybody's shot. Muammar Khadaf's the dot, X mark the spot. with an infrared to your head, left for dead. Fuck the feds, flee the country then grow some dreads (ya mon). I suggest you keep your distance, for instance, the same distance. it takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Strike one, when a nigga talkin shit with his hands. Strike two, gettin caught in the wrong place with your pants down. Strike three, tryin to fuck with the D-O-double-G. D-R-E, or any of my Alkaholik family. Huh, Xzibit turn your vital signs to a straight line. Never seen a dog bite and bark at the same time. Restless, rugged, never relaxed. Permanently owe you motherfuckers backs like tax. Baseball bats and breaks upside of your head. Homey STILL gettin swoll off water and bread. I got this, retaliation, for any situation I'm facin. and leave the stage with a standin ovation, it's like. [Chorus]."
beware of us,"Yeah, Stong Arm Steady. One gang, four guns, how the West was won, let's go. [Chorus: Xzibit]. Jump if you really want it (jump). You'll catch one in yo' stomach (yeah!). When you see the Steady comin {*blam*}. Y'all better bewaaaaaaare of us. Loudmouths is always talkin (talkin). When we come they keep on walkin (walkin). But my dogs ain't only barkin (woof!). Y'all better bewaaaaaaare of us. [Chorus]. [Strong Arm Steady - 1]. I'm eatin chicken wings, mm, it's like chicken feed. Mm, I'm at the feedhouse smokin all this chicken's weed. Huh, you're hardly hard, this sucker's soft as volleyball. Cold Chillin' like my name was +Big Daddy+ +Marley Marl+. You're not a star at all, no, you're just a sidekick, yeh. Runnin the outside lickin shit and ridin dicks. Real niggaz start cliques, start shit we spark clips. The mac'll make your door lift and leave me with a sore wrist. You should be impressed, yeh, it's like my first impression. I pull representer, exposition in a session. I'm in the Expedition, expose a dark dimension. Your girl used to suck dick du-ring detention. You got dumped, she came up by spittin. out nuts of every homey comin home from prison. Yeah the fake chicks get dick the Ferragamo fake fits. I keep they drawers drenched, no drawers, fake tits. [Chorus]. [Strong Arm Steady - 2]. This the last call, total recall, my pimpin flowin like Niagara Falls. So you can Phil Da Agony y'all. Yeah you get beat to the punch, rap monsters eat you for lunch. And feed you to the beat that you want. Fear keep knockin fake fans sent to no one. Fuck them niggaz run from me I don't owe 'em. Why do things for free, you don't know 'em. These niggaz'll load up the heat, they don't throw 'em. Hooks stay floatin in my mind, I design 'em like. architects workin online, I'm on the incline. Lamp like the heavyweight champ, it took 3 months of trainin. While it's rainin take your brain through boot camp. Fair facts, Nike Air Max, I'm back blunted. Yeah that them niggaz hear that and don't want it. Triple trick niggaz get sick to they stomach. Strong Arm Steady ready act like you want it - BITCH!. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Every day above ground is a good day. My wordplay only contain what the hood say. Clack the black off a nigga make him see the light. My overhand right'll violate your civil rights. We get bars, big cars, cigars. 12 gauge salute to your face to face God. Icon, marathon mack, where the bitches at?. Raise it back, steady game, came with a gang of gats. I hit your pressure points, we jack the motherlode. Expose your motives like a CSI episode. Output maximum level, dig deep down in the dirt. with diligence and dance with the devil, yeah. Cause you don't know me homey, I keep the banger on me. It wasn't my aim, it came with the territory. Feet planted firm in the turf, plant you six feet deep in the earth. Gettin slumped while the ammo dump, fucker. [Chorus]. Bewaaaaaaare of us [BLAM]"

Gon rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city. Chronic low ridin bitches with silicon tities. (we gon bounce and ball until the wheels fall off). I got a big bang theory my hardcore committee. Gon rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city. Affiliated with thousands sent out medallions. (we gon bounce and floss until the wheels fall off. [Kurupt]. Chest plates hit with gauges, sawed off, hauled off. Blast wit somethin and I breaks all the walls off. Fuck it, tie my flag around my mouth. Blue rag on my face, blue rag in my left pocket. Pistols screamin, unleashin pure fury. Smash, snatch the pockets and all the jewelry. Glass shattering, blastin, niggas scatterin. Scat, takin three to four to the back. I'm back motherfucker, live broadcast. Show my face, with my rag on, let me throw my hood in the air. Let me put 'bout two in the air. Let me show these motherfuckers that I don't care. It's a symphony composed of killers and armed forces. Livin for whatever it cost's, crimb bosses. [Pinky]. It's goin down by the year 2 G. I'm goin be flyin through the hood, duckin, dodgin the heat. My niggas watch the street, be it rain, snow, or sleet. Us niggas gon eat, makin troops we creep. Losin the jeep, runnin on feet, survivin off the land money and. Gun in hand, operation quicksand. Aint tryin ta put the mark of the beast on my hand. I had to bless the head of a military man. Jumped into the back of the 4 door sedan. All up in the trunk was the hidden contraband. Fuck a middleman, my pistols aim directly from Iran. Looking from a third eye, I spot the hidden cam. I know what you look like, I know how you think. I'm the type of bitch to pop a pill up in your drink. HOOK. [CPO]. Bitch, fuck that, you bring fat rag, here's cheese. You work your fuckin employees. You know you get all excited like that. Stack it through them hoodlum back, cuz I like it like that, bitch. I kill drama, shit get action packed. When I jump out the black stealth bomber. Cuz it's bout, you know, I want the fuckin mansion pad. To heal that bitch sittin on. So don't waste the fuckin cheese that you earn. Rotate the fuckin weed that you burn. Don't fuck with Bossy off the glam,. Rollin crack , blow blocks in half. [Tray Deee]. We rides on visitors and takes no prisoners. Handles all business and pay off the comissioner. Big time crime figure niggas gettin riches. 20 inches whippin all we givin hittin switches. Twistin flippin chickens stickin victims if they slippin. Trippin, on the mission and my trigga finga itchin. Positioned at your dome, one twitch and it's on. No remorse or second thoughts once the clip and the chrome. This is the zone, weak niggas covers get blown. Stoned killers and gorillas want whatever you want. Shake spots with bank nots, keep the thang cocked. And leave motherfuckers stripped to tank tops. We the gang, it's our thang to mash and maintain. Gangbang slang came and aint gon change. All out till we fall out, fuck the world. DoggHouse style with the chucks and curls. HOOK."
big business,"{Xzibit}. Mi casa es su casa. Mi raza es su raza. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kid Frost. This is big business, understand me?. Yeah, you can't take no for a answer. Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made. You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades. We're playin catch with a hand grenade. Cause what you faggot niggas caught. Spread you all over the asphalt. Walk the walk, talk to nobody. Spark the chrome shotie. Whenever they run up on your home, Gotti. Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it. Xzibit get your whole shit crowded. And packed to capacity. You actually had the audacity. To want some problems with the X Man. Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand. Learn one of life's hard lessons. You can't negotiate with a weapon. When it's fully loaded and cocked. Hollow points shot. Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop. I took you off, so accept the loss. Crack open some Olde English that's covered with frost. And it's like that. [ CHORUS ]. Can you feel it, nothing can save ya. For this is the season for stackin the papers. Chasin my chips till my last days. Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways. {Frost}. I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces. Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases. Please understand automatically. One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy. Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me. My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically. Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me. 50/50 - half gangster, half hustler. One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka. So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like Swiss-made. Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade. Razor, got the H-K with the laser. Slid the Enterpriser, rent a 99 black Blazer. I shot straight at Merino. Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the Peppermint Casino. I been a player before I had riches. And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches. [ CHORUS ]. {Jayo Felony}. I don't give a fuck about not one of y'all. Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin y'all. When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite. I take flight like Delta, nigga, helter skelter. Who the fuck could you call to help ya. Nigga, good health couldn't help ya. Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya. Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off. Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off. But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off. Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher. Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit. Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit. Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic. Static, what's that? That shit that get up in my fabric. I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips. And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch. [ CHORUS ]."

Livin the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs. Dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave. Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me. I just want you all to notice me and people to see. that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me. It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me. is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean. So when you see me, dressin up like a nerd on TV. or heard the CD usin the fag word so freely. it's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?. {*LOWER pitch*} Suck my fuckin dick, you faggot. You happy now? Look here. [Eminem - impersonating Snoop]. I start some trouble everywhere that I go (that I go). Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know (cause they know).

Watchin paper thugs tryin to hide behind the industry. From here to infinity, love thy enemy. Niggaz got the knowledge but don't know the chemistry. All inside your baseball hat and kneecaps. with baseball bats ('TIL FAME HIT YOU WITH THE MINI-MAC). Full body black fatigues, lungs black from weed. In black limo tinted SUV's with Bill.

black & brown,"Wassup? We need to talk. Let me light my backport. (lights up). (exhales). That's why we need to sit down. And talk about the black and the brown. Yo, I love Los Angeles, you can hear it in my music. Plus I got the scars to prove it. And man.. you don't understand what I understand. I'm feelin like a piece to a bigger plan. 'Cause all I'm sayin is the God honest truth of it all, we fightin the wrong enemy. That's why I'm gettin invovled, it's just like the end of that movie ""Saw"". When them two chained up guys met with their demise. And the mastermind was layin there the whole time. Remember that? That's why we have to sit down. And speak about the black and the brown. Now I didn't come here to point no fingers. I know over the years that the pain still lingers over past confrontations. Shit we all on parole and probation and fucked up situations. And everybody lose.. from the pen, to the neighborhoods, now it's even the high schools. 'Cause I was watchin K. Cal News. when the students squared off and one kid wouldn't choose sides. Hit with a hammer and the kid died and now it's a full blown riot. Tck, that's when the fists start flyin. These kids ain't learnin shit about math and science. Man... Tension is so thick, some are comin around. I don't wanna see no more of us up under the ground. So now.. that's why we need to sit down. And talk about the black and the brown. Eighty percent of inmates are black and Hispanic. They tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet. Dammit.. that's why we need to sit down. And talk about the black and the brown. Yo, I got the homey Jose from way back in the day. He came to scoop me up in his all white Six-Trey. And he don't really fuck with nobody outside of the set. It's tatted big on his neck. Y'know? So over the years, built respect and trust. Some black and brown issues we both discussed. He said, ""Homes, it's been goin down too long. I gotta bang on them fools and it don't feel wrong"". ""They killed my cousin over eighty eight bricks. So word came down, we gotta handle that shit"". ""Kill all mayatas in white tee shirts. Can I tell the truth homes? The truth starts hurtin"". At first, I remind him of what vengeance do. What vengeance is and who vengeance belongs to. He wasn't tryna hear that shit. He just turned up the volume, bangin 50 Cent. I got soldiers from both sides who really don't care. Who identify themselves by the colors they wear. The homey came through to put one in the air. I can tell somethin was wrong the way he sat in his chair. He said, ""X, man I'm just gettin out. from doin eighty eight months, tryna figure things out"". He told me in the pen you get down to get done. 'Cause the brown and black ratio is five to one. He showed me the scar on his gut and his neck. They got him good, said he damn near bled to death. The hate was do deep, I can see in his eyes. When he described what it feels like to almost die. All I could do was just sit back and listen. 'Bout how he 'bout to send soldiers on missions. I got hit with a bottle but I'm not dead. I said, ""Think with your heart homey, not your head"". I said. Oooooh you must defend yourself (Yeah!). If you don't, then no one else (Nobody!). Your homies got to ride (Let's go!). You're fighting for your life (Yeah!). They want both of us dead. You ain't heard a word I said. You're fighting for your life (Come on). Your homies got to riiide"

Built for this all work no play here to stay. The rest get blown away. C'mon. [Hook]. [Xzibit]. Neva seen heard felt befo. Wanna rumble wit us just start the show. Fill up the chamber let me go.

cali kings part 1,"""The first up on the mic, is my homeboy Xzibit *echoes*"". Verse one: Xzibit. If it wasn't for the West. These rap niggaz wouldn't need a vest around they chest. Keeping bustin about, where you at? and what you owe, and what you drive?. So the day some niggaz come for you I'm really not surprised. Mr. Black Bruce Willis. Please don't kill us. I show mercy like Kevorkian. Like a scorpion. I sting you from behind and put it in you. Meet me at the venue, put you on the spot to put you on the menu. Its the MC, I be the one that keeps the bitches hot. Xzibit living life, like a ball inside a ?riders slot?. Dripping everything cause you ain't even got a dime to drop. Go ahead and call the cops; you ain't did nothing. Jerry Spring you out the studio, me and Suge Knight into the parking lot. Niggaz ain't ready for all the shit I've got. Look at yourself crushing Xzibit with your tough talk. That's like Christopher Reeves doing a Crip walk. Chorus:. Cali Kings is fresh out the box. Yeah, straight up, night on the rocks. *repeat*. Verse two: Likwit. Knock your songs. Is defendin minor foes. Every squeeze I let a minute. ?To freeze and stay cold?. I prepare to blast hoes. Cause they say these flows is lethal. I'm peepin through my peephole. They sneekin up on me though. Rico got a pistol, NASA got a missile. Likwit got too drunk so now the party is official. I bounce until the end and still set it with bad credit. Got a wack-ass record deal but I signed before I read it. But don't regret it, everything is so pathetic. When the water's gettin deep you can drown or you can tread it. I battle with finesse, like my niggaz giving quest. In these ??? we got props, we taking less. So, don't touch that stereo. Or your people will becoming to your burry, yo. The ever sorry yo can blast, I'm here to blow it through the roof. I snatch the money and the hoes and disappear like boo! *echoes*. Chorus 2X. Verse three: Baka Boy. Yo its the ?? with Baka Boys, rings and Cali Kings. I've never been the one for police but like sing. Every breath you take and every move I make. Shot heard around the world from the Golden State. I'm off the ringer with mine, your Jerry Springer with yours. Your gettin missed like a bitch and I can keep out your jaw. You hold your mop and run shop. Before I known to blow spots. Baka Boys ain't no choice so blastin on your block. I hold it down in the crowd for Cali Kings. And John P. and no P, no Sing-Sing. Laser tape, my name shall be ?regularly great?. I buy no plate, green trees roll, into lock and gate. B-A-K-A-B-O-Y. Who would believe Baka Boys with the four eyes?. And like Primo and Guru You Know My Steez. Big shot to the city in the valley, Cali Kings. Likwit Crew coming through I pay due. Cali Kings, Cali Kings. Chorus 2X."

Gotta carry the weight youknowhatI'msayin'. Go ahead. Yeah! I break it down like this. Verse One:. You see I don't like to remenisce about the past. The lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth. Each and every wrong move the police keep count. make it real fuckin' easy to get streched out. I was at the funeral when it all began. You know the painful transition from a boy to men. I lost sight of my mother at the age of nine. didn't understand death nearly lost my mind. But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it. Age ten, new step family arrangement. at thirteen, I started gettin' hair on my dick. And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit. I would forever be hit with anything in reach. Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach. about forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked. Gettin' jump when he said and the head gat cracked. physical contact was in form of a slap. at the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back. courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap. Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black. Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate. Into juvenile detention where I built up hate. I don't remember the date of the judical debate. but legally I was now in custody of the state. Chorus:. And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink. Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak. I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make. Gotta find some way to release this hate. And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink. Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak. I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make. Gotta find some way Xzibit carry the weight. Interlude: Xzibit, [J-Ro].

Verse Two:. And that was worse then the treatment I was gettin' at home. but only now I was fucked up plus all alone. My father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone. Turned age sixteen now on my own. Started running with cats who carried gats cause they had too. with no hesitation lock load then blast you. Without a hastle we in a town of hicks. fuckin' all these chicks. Sellin' rock by the bricks. so we feelin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown. At the house when the mothafuckin' man touched down. Screamin' demands ""Let me see your goddamn hands (now)"". A.T.F. cause of handguns and contraban. we never kept it in the house. So of course we clounded. Only found one pistol took us all down town. We be out by the end of the afternoon. gettin' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM!. Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife. Ty and Matt caught bodies. Now they spend there life behind bars. catchin' scars that will not heal. niggas don't know the half about keepin' it real. Chorus 1 1/2. Outro:. Like this. Like this, like that. Yeah! gotta carry the weight. Like this euh!. Bringin live. Yeah! yeah! like this. It's Xzibit. Gotta carry the weight. Like that yo!. Like that yo!."
chamber music,"Verse One:. The official representative, LAC. This is phrophecy manifested by X to the Z. Victory, strike a B-Boy stance in khaki pants. Never get along like red and black ants, advance. When your staring and this concrete that move like liquid. Like a nigga withouth legs, I ain't tryin to kick it. To much to finish, a menace, without enought time. My mind only give punchline, you probably thinkin of the wrong kind. Cause if it jokes, nigga know. The kind that drop on your eyes, your ears, your nose, and your throat. I promote self-defense not dollars and sense. Kick it with scholars and pimps, you just the last part over the fence. Assed out in the open, while you was hopin that Xzibit was second rate. But I refuse to make; just another record in the crate. I think not, got bee-bops. I bring it to your house like pizza. ""Today we are on the streets of South Central Los Angelos, a fight for. survival"". ""We have people that are conditioned not to expect to live past age thirty.. They no longer. Once they no longer care they're extremely dangerous."". Verse Two:. Stand at attention, make sure you keep your piece clean. When I release steam, police crime scenes to guillotines. Hit and decapatate the bird case, featherweight. Critical thinking, while you at water that concentrate. Xzibit crash the gate, heavyweight, box em in. Seal off the exits, then cut off your Oxygen. Xzibit run with a regiment of veterans. I only like to come out Late Night, like Dave Letterman. Time for some medicine, cause niggas bout to get sick. Callin me a hater cause I don't ride dicks.

That catch you at the right time in the wrong place. We unsafe, One-fifty-one with no chase and no ice. Take away your life like three strikes. Yeah, come on, Chamber Music. Verse Three:. So now Xzibit got a little money, I think its funny. How motherfuckers think I'm supposed to Cher/share like Sonny. Clarify, you don't work you don't eat, I repeat. You don't eat you get weak, catch a fragile physique. Accomplish more in one day, than you can do in a week. The X-Man, Wolverine, one swing to make the cut clean. And the wrong things manifested in flesh. Fuck the game, I take the test, graduate, pass to the S-Class. Catch a roadrash, all you smell is hash. Chronic mix, bumpin the Liks. And dick you like a Hebron fix. Bear-arm from here to a hundred-tweny meters. Get black-walled, modern day Lee Harvey Oswald. The assassin, brother who came blastin. Take it without askin, rappers is all fashion. Xzibit keep mashing through. Got any lost words? I got two. Drive up, on you like that!. Once again Chamber Music, what what, yeah, what the deal? It's Xzibit.. Get on the ground, get on the ground! Hands on the back of your head, Don'. Move Don't Move! Get on the ground! * beat to fade *."

Get in line, bitches stay on the grind, cause I'm on mines. Redecorate your hips and lips and thighs. Ain't surprised you can be so pretty and be so nasty. Ass in the air like a pass to Grassi. It's a, thin line between hoes and women. And close my dick with a hat and change the linen. [Interlude]. [Chorus] - repeat 2X."
cold world,"[Verse 1:]. Justine, 19, just got clean. Fresh outta rehab with self-esteem. She ain't felt this good in a while. A new leash on life, a vibrant thang, a beautiful. smile. Used to run with a circle of friends, who was skeleton. thin. Sniff white lines off powerful men. But see, all that's a thang of the past, she got. class. And be damned if she'd let herself burn and crash. She ain't from money so she startin from scratch. It's hard working for scraps. It take everything she got not to relaspe. Locked down in 9 to 5, but at the 9 to 5. She get sexually harrased and chastised. Boss is a married man, she won't touch him. Frustrated angry man, she won't f**k him. She's out of her job, at Basket Cakes. Least it came wit an 8, 2 lines to the face. God Damn!. [Chorus]. It's a cold, cold, world, and you know it. Niggaz will lay you down and take your bread, yeah and. you know it. Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just. die with it!. Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just. die with it!. yeah. [Verse 2:]. He was on his own, at a very young age. When he learned from the streets, made everything. change. See he came up with hustlers, lost his religion. It's funny how money can make a nigga think he livin. I ain't talkin paper like Jigga or Dre. It's more like 7500, 9 ounces of lle'. That's what he say he can get for the flip, they. thought the deal was legit. But he stuck him and split, in deep shit. Now his mother work for minimum pay. Live a positive way, she the first one at church every. Sunday. Blind to the needs of her son, he's a gatling gun. In the streets, jackin niggaz for fun. It's a non-stop search through the hood, but can't. catch him. They found out where mom stayed and went steppin. The evil that men do, but still we continue. With death and dishonor, for the all mighty dollar,. it's so cold. [Chorus]. [Verse 3:]. He was 13, brought up in Baghdad. Ate with his right and made money with his left hand. Prayed to the East, 5 times daily. His mother and father just had a new born baby. Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight. And built his family on 5 pillars of faith. Never trippin off Western ways, it meant nada. Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kabba. 300 miles away, British troops hit Basra. His cousin waged jihad and died with honor. He heard about the buildings on 9-11. And a man named Bush on a search for weapons. Now here come the U.S., to crush Saddam. Wit 88 thousand tons of missle and bombs. But his family's too broke to move or find shelter. If they all had to die, they would die together and. that's cold... damn. [Chorus]. [Reporter]. We don't know whats the status of the victim is right. now.... At this point, they could be walking into the. aftermath of a mugging or a crime of passion, and may. have to confront the violent suspect, the reporters. force:. someone has been stabbed. . Zéhh"

So precise, so deattached. Oh my God, who is that?. [Xzibit]. Hibernate, consummate. Man was made to procreate. My estate, generates. As if my family name was Gates. Days of grace, lift big plates. Why be good nigga, go be great. Hit the breaks, crack them crates. Have you on the run goin state to state. Contemplate, demonstrate. Mind over mayhem, no mistakes. Lift some weights, eat some steaks. But you don\'t really want that face to face. But let\'s relax, check your traps. Don\'t let yo\' concentration snap. I love the way she arch her back. Like how a muh\'fucker \'sposed to handle that?. [Chorus One + Chorus Two]. [Xzibit]. Breath control, touch yo\' soul. Just maintain don\'t lose control. Participate, congratulate. Cause everything else\'ll be seen as hate. Remain in place, the same mindstate. Get off yo\' ass and celebrate. Congregate, associate. Don\'t fuck yo\'self procrastinate. Dilate, to an all time great. Calculate the next move I make. Crack the safe, keep that ace. in my waistband just in case. I\'m no rat can\'t run yo\' race. Not too good don\'t fit my taste. I love the way she make that shake. Makin it hard to concentrate. [Chorus Two + Chorus One]. [28 seconds of instrumental]. \""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\"" - [repeat 4X right before song\'s end]"
concrete,"[Shabaam Sahdeeq]. Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah.... As the world turn, cash to earn, falonious burn. We Takin Ova, its our turn, where the moss burnin?.

Cash gotta get it, bag a girl when we spit it. Our team win it, drop gems for peops listenin. Put your ears to the concrete, feel the buzz on the street. [Xzibit]. Yo, yo, this is dedicated to the niggaz that be hatin me. But never can face me, because they scared for their own safety. Replace me? Mr. X to the Z. It's B.Y.O.B. cause all the pussy is free (pussy's free). And everything else is me and my niggaz spreadin the wealth. Cross me I'll introduce you to the devil himself. See I'm the motherfuckin man layin over Japan. Computer hack through your laptop. then leave your whole SoundScanned (what the fuck?!?). And watch you panick like the bitch you are. I'm the mechanic with a pipe bomb that fits your car. Ka-boom, now I assume your homies wanna retalliate. Set em straight with a thirty-eight, the wrong cat to violate. So watch Xzibit and Shabaam start to dilate. Anihilate competition, some niggaz got hard heads. And just don't listen, they the ones you find missin. Better get on the right team and play your position. See I'm lost, scandalous, finest. Blew your back out because your spineless. I'm never makin music for the mindless. Cause I'm hard to the core, and I'll never go soft. Just consider us the hitmen thats knockin you off. Chorus *1X*. [Xzibit]. Yeah, yeah, See I'm ready to raise a ruckus. Try to elevate you motherfuckers to the places where the law can't touch us. Walk off on your own or with the aid of crutches. Anyway you want it to happen I'm ready for action. You get shot up under my soles, call it Fatal Attraction. Beat you niggaz till you get it right, like Joe Jackson. Listen, we here to give the hardcore what they lookin for. At the same time pimp the game like a fucking whore. [Shabaam Sahdeeq]. In this game here, we got swift handles. Dismantle your chalkboard strategy, check the replay. Here you gets no shine we dimmin your light. Make your heart pump *echoes* when my squad's in sight. Shorty got assets and a man that ask bets. Lost it all fuckin round with the dice, you ain't nice. You a sacrifice, guinea pig, you dig?. Roast you, get a jokey smurf through the postal. Chorus *2X*."

Dirty South connect, so show some respect. When my niggaz comin through you see we comin correct. Who are you, what you do, who you tryin to threat?. [Xzibit]. I'm the wrong cat to call out; we fall out. The police gon' have some dead bodies to haul out. All out in the open for the world to see. Avire-X to the Z-I, B-I-T. V.I.P., you're small time, three on three. cause you can't ball accurately, tackle the beast. Stomp it down, slap it with heat, bitch behave. Shit, we blaze to make a nigga act his age. I'm tryin to write the phrase that pays. You kick it with gays, dykes, and all type of wackness. Preach what you practice. Here we seperate the real niggaz from the actors. A&R's, MC searchin, suck my cactus!. Blackness surround your sight and sound. as Xzibit hit you and you hit the ground. My chips ain't never gon' be down, watch me smoke. and flatline the first nigga to cross this line. [Chorus]. [Gipp]. It's the Gipp Goodie, we kick the soul slang. to yo' block, or they streets, we all gon' hang. We like to shine and ride, bump corners in our bumper cars. Top down, with the candy paint job. Import export up and down the highway. Old ladies transportin straight through the skyways. In the corner in the five(?) I got purple haze. Fat knot short sess with the tree ton(?). These streets we run, rapper refund. You ridin up but we want yo' flows old like Girbauds. We hold, everything it takes to create the odes. to North to the West to the South again. If it's war that you want just pull the pin. Rules we don't break 'em, we refuse to bend. If you don't build right you better take yo' ass home. cause some catch stray bullets all alone. [Chorus]. [Pharoahe Monch]. I got the Chevy Impala shit, street scholar with. collarless, Japanese aikido with, Rottweiler mixed. Top dollar dick now, swallow my whole nut rap. Gun in my mouth, pop shit, still sayin, ""Fuck that"". You have to listen, brew, trapped in a tragic addiction. Styles, multiply like Japanese mathematicians. Cut cause chaos - my kicks kill criminals. I'm the subliminal Adolf. I'm the bomb that's attached to the time of a ticker. figure or swastika. Quicker to pick a form of execution, pull it. Bullet, to the head instead of eletrocution. The rambunctious, bump in yo' trunk shit. Totally insane, Hurricane with Pharoahe Monch, Gipp. Xzibit the West coast (??) (??) we got. New York wearin slippers and the South wearin hoodies. [Chorus 3X]. [DJ Hurricane]. Ye-yeah, uh-huh, ye-yeah. Give it up, uh-huh (Dirty South) ye-yeah, ye-yeah. Give it up, uh-huh, give it up, shake it. Uh-huh, kick it (Dirty South) uh-huh. Shake it.. uh-huh, shake it. C'mon, give it up (Dirty South). {*fades out*}."
crazy ho,"[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]. I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin me. All day and all night long, she just keeps callin me. She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go. Somebody pray for me, cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho. [Suga Free]. Comin from a cat, that uhh. believe that if wasn't nobody else in the world to pimp. he'll probably pimp hisself, that's me, Suga Free. Dig that, yeah, again? Uhh X, man, y'know.

[Strong Arm Steady - 1]. Woman out the wilderness - bitch!. The homies say you got a wildabeast piece. But she a dimepiece, her mind lost, thrown off course. She been divorced twice, overwhelmed by - bad advice. from a past life, she crazy though. Call my telephone a hundred times in a row. I don't know how to let her go. I'm stuck with this ho - pardon me. But she ain't nuttin but the worst part of me. She even threatened to slice her artery. I gotta watch my God Degree. She tried to voodoo the peas and throw her eyelashes in the recipe. Please, it's more than she's spittin in my lemonade. and R. Kelly ain't got the right to sing the hook, like Butch. Yeah, c'mon, spit it. [Chorus]. [Strong Arm Steady - 2]. Now since chickens of a feather be cluckin together. And I met her through Aiesha, I shoulda known better. She a pro-fessional charger Laker chaser. The kind that'll lie and say one of 'em raped her (trick). But she in love with a gangsta. And it's been all trivial since the day that I janked her. Swore she wasn't ghetto but I met her at Fairmont. Shoulda knew she was a gangsta when she said that it wasn't her man's car. - but now she crazy over me. Tryin to OD, cause she can't be with me. She'll, fuck with different sets just to bring you beef. Fake a pregnancy just to get you fo' a G, crazy. [Butch Cassidy]. How much can one man take?. Worried if I leave it's her life she'll take. So I'm stuck here livin life in fear. Situation so severe. I need to change my ways. Pay more attention to her ho-pefully. Thinkin with my dick every night and day. The bitch won't go away. [Strong Arm Steady - 3]. Girl stop screamin. All in front of my house, tellin everybody you not leavin. And just beat it - you're insane. Crazy and deranged and I don't need you. Look, don't make me repeat it. I'ma say it one time, kick rocks or I'ma call the one-time. I shoulda hollered at your sister (aiy). We went to the same high school, and plus she finer than you. Hey - baby this one's on you. You know it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none too. You dug my man out, your hand's out, askin for help. Hey - go 'head trick, kill yourself, {?}. [Chorus]. [Suga Free]. That means you ain't doin it for free. And that's what I'm talkin 'bout, Suga Free. Up in here with Xzibit y'knamhsayin, West coast big style. We really doin this out here f'real homey. Y'knahmsayin, y'all get to know, y'knahmsayin. You'll get to know yo' folks a little bit better too. if you just uhh, recognize this P, y'knahmean?.

And get wet from the reign of the tec, I {""break 'em off somethin""}. ""Back to the criminal set... but they can't catch me yet"" - Ice Cube. Your gum bumpin gon' lead to gun bumpin {""break 'em off somethin""}. I'm the one when the party is jumpin to {""break 'em off somethin""}. [Xzibit]. I heard the O.G.'s they don't hit. And I'm the only one left from the West that you can't fuck with. But lately I've been feelin like Will Smith. Why bother with rap when I can get 20 mill' on a flick?. Y'all niggaz just started some shit, the underdog. Makin songs for them hogs, and them Bloods and Crips. For the shah by the mall with a Muslim scent. After all, who do you call to rock your shit? {""break 'em off somethin""}. Bust the ghetto bird, circle above, reminisce. of the dust kicked up, the dirt swept under the rug. Duct tape, ski-mask, tape recorders. Cue Kaze, ready to blaze and bakin soda. First learned how to cook in a coffee pot. Made the block get hot like lava rock. Got love for the block cause I came from that. But I ain't afraid to go right back {""break 'em off somethin""}. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. It's a, suicide it's a suicide. If you ever get the heart to try fuckin with mines. No change, I'm poppin the nine, you ridin the pine {""break 'em off somethin""}. The heavy metal knock you out of your mind {""break 'em off somethin""}. Now how many really gon' ride, when the war start?. Eaten alive by these hollow-tip darts. My 12 gauge'll tear you apart, don't get caught at the light. the house party or the neighborhood park. Mr. X marks the spot then pops the mark. Turn your whole neighborhood to a parkin lot. I paid the cost to be the boss. and will do my time standin up 'til I get an appeal. These weapons too real to conceal, so why bother. Semper fidelis, I learned from my father. I always stay faithful to myself and grow. But when I catch that ass after the show - {""break 'em off somethin""}. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. I'm slick and slippery. On a high-speed chase all the way to the victory. Y'all niggaz is stone cold mysteries. Too weak, can't stand in the ring with me. Put a pussy back in his place, straightlaced. With a Strong Arm Steady gang up in your face. I run a race with the West to my back. While you're the reason why they say niggaz in the West can't rap. Ever since the white Concourse 'Llac, I've been unmatched. A avalanche in the hood on attack. Just hardcore actual facts, never wait. Just react when them killers come at you with gats. Had to dig the knife out of my back, now I'm back on track. Hittin laps, 'bout to widen the gap yo. It ain't the long fall from the top that got 'em. It was the sharp sudden stop at the bottom, haha {""break 'em off somethin""}"

Just consider me the heir to the throne. The lifestyle of the savage and well known protectin my owns. Rolling stone bringin it home, time for transition. Don't talk too loud, you might find yourself missin. Look into my eyes, all you see is will to survive. by any means, retreatin to the Phillipines. to meditate, liftin train like a heavyweight. Hit you and run with a California license plate. [Chorus: Xzibit + Snoop]. [X] When y'all niggaz stop actin like bitches. [X] bitches stop actin like niggaz we can all clock figures.

With the flick of a wrist, send you deep into the abyss. I don't pop Cryst', but will pop a nigga with this. Made my way to the top of the list, raised your fifth. Anything to keep it movin make it harder to hit. We survive when you thought we was finished and done. Lookin over my cold shoulder is Attila the Hun. The gatling gun, guillotine, Don King's American Dream. Since sixteen, shoulda been a marine. Makin the whole scene collapse, millenium raps. Why fight for scraps, relax and take the whole plate witcha. The penny pitcher with a whole lot of come and get ya. You gettin my picture or do I have to let 'em hit ya? HUAHH!. Feel the adrenaline rush whenever I bust. Got eyes in back of my head. The people the I trust is just like me. Full of spite with very large appetites.

So don't approach me, I won't approach you. And don't insult me, I won't insult you. Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do. [Xzibit]. Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight. Bein underrated gave me time to create it. Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate. Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate. Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate. Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face. No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows. You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home. But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me (yeah). Packed up, moved out, started a new family. So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up. marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?. FUCK THAT, this the fuckin thanks I get. for tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch. Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down). cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child. It's like... [Eminem]. .. everyday I wake up, another drama. It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma. If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer. I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her. without these cameras in our faces like animals. for your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue. and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts. and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence. And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun. whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one. No bullet, you're so full of shit. this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it. And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood. I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude. over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit. Don't tell me bout the show business shit. I know what this is, bitch. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. This ain't business, this is personal BITCH. You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed. I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit. Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th. Yo Em it's time to get serious with it (yeah). Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet. This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs. Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us. Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self. I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth. To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla. at the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones. Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel. Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin piano. Ridin slow through Cali like I'm ridin a camel. Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels. I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?. Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down. Spit lines to split spines just to get mine. Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine. Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope. Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin the soap. Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip. and turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit. [Eminem]. So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself. a front door with twelve locks. and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox. and everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?. Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots. and one in the chamber, gun in the waist. and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place. tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not. gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?. And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys. in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn. screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit. Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip. And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live. so my address ends up on the internet again. So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them. that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs. And reporters, blow it out of proportion. ""Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans. just for tryin to stand on his porch"". And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like ""Hey hi!. You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!"". Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle. and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you. It's not that I don't like you... .. it's just that I'm not behind the mic. I'm a person who's just like you."

Xzibit keep it on deck. Live, vinyl, CD or cassette. Whatever you select. I keep you bouncin' like a bad cheque. See I should have a trigger tattooed on my neck. To represent the heat that I repeat. Now you can take the highs out of the beat. But never take the rucked out of the rhyme. Or tribalize, look into the eyes of the emotional. Your whole style is promotional. A dead giveaway to me is just another business day. Xzibit here to stay. My life, a tribute to the A.K,. you wanna play. A situation only one man can walk away from. The same way he came. When I spit flame, it spits flames like your middlename. So why do I say fuck the fame. Because it come and go. The industry's a pet without refused to be that gigolo. I put the dope in, got fo's and tatoos. Niggas make ya money. But let the money make you. Hook: [King T] x2. We make, make money, money. Take's money to survive.

Who drop when a dime never got me straight. I'm still goin' for broke. I push you to the stroke. And one man loc and say high. Smokin' to keep an open, mind. Focus on military time provokin'. The G in me, nigga. (?) when he tried to step the Soopafly. AZ you are shit. Now gettin' down with the Pound. Now who can shake it till it break ground. Many motherfuckers are greedy. There's only one thing needed like E.D.I, Amin / I mean business. When it comes to the cash, I'm movin' quick. (Xzibit: Any other nigga eat a dick). Fuck type shit. Make ya step back.

Sick of all these threats, these bitches with no action. Hog-tie, watch you die and start laughin. And no longer will I sit back and let you disrespect the fact. that we elevated West coast rap. And bring shit back to the point ""X"" is all that they checkin for. In the clubs, the streets, the shows and the record stores. What more can you ask for, eat your heart out. Fall out with bitch niggaz constantly callin my name out. I'm really not givin a fuck, you're pressin your luck. I'm a walkin warhead ready to self-destruct, so WHAT?!. [Chorus]. [Xzibit].

Burn bridges you could never repair. I slap box with a bear. I can speak from experience, you speak from ignorance. I remove you, have your whole family feelin it. Y'all hate the fact that X-Man got hustle. ""Man vs Machine,"" mind vs. muscle. I drop concoctions, you leave me no options. Have your bitch screamin out, ""SOMEBODY STOP HIM!!"".

Handle your business. Don't let your business handle you. It's a lot of motherfuckers tryin' to do. What you're doin' right here, right now. Same color, same style. Tryin' to claim worldwide.

Here we are face to face. Nigga make your move. You're in the wrong place. But at the right situation. Cause i was waitin. Hotter than Satan, never perpetratin. [Chorus:]. I treat my enemies like friends. So I can reach out and touch. Leave'em in the dust at the very end. You now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin. Ice cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins. Animosity you can reach out and touch. Heavy right handed. Teeth grind like a clutch. And plus you ain't never had this much. Too many friends too close. You might collapse from an overdose. I was raised to never follow after no man. To be my own man. So I can die by my own hand. And never knowin' what the next day can bring. So I gotta make the ends. Justify the means. Yo, I'm on the scene, here to do my own thing. Can't never spend a lifetime. Chasin' after dreams. I got the right shit. For all the wrong reasons. As long as I breathin'. Niggas change like seasons. Never trust a man. Who can't look you in your eyes. Only the strong survive. And that's word to the wise. Yo, when dead bodies get outlined in chalk. Everybody should walk. Cause real killers don't talk. I ain't really concerned. How many bridges you burned. I extinguish your flame. And take aim at your brain. Givin' ligament pain. To have you walkin' with a cane. Wantin' money and fame. You got your fuckin' self to blame. And that's West Coast rhyme. Without no gimmicks. Here come Xzibit to break it down. Like a chemic. I'm spreadin' like an epidemic. And all good things come to an end. Enemies & Friends. [Chorus]. I don't give a fuck. About the set you claim. Xzibit easily dispersed like crack cocaine. See I lent my shotgun to Kurt Cobain.

In this shit called rap. Here to let you know. My sound surrounds like dat. Never half step. Or play the role like DeNiro. Y'all niggas wasn't down. When we had less than zero.

Plus I'm dreaded not by the locks but by the cops. And flocks of females that only think with their croth. Unlimitted smoke. The bonified cut throat Columbian neck tie. Now don't you look fly. I'll leave you there to be discovered by your mother. Or maybe your brother or your boty boy lover. No matter your backround Xzibit never backs down.

I'd like to say this off the record. But it's not. So I testify to the fact. Chronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact. It makes it real easy to trip. Unload the whole clip on your block then split!. Aint no answers to the test you taken. Never move fakin'. Can't be shaken'. From my solid foundation like this. [Chorus]: (2x). Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit. And all of that shit. And you still won't step. So what's next?. All of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin. [You Better off buckin yourself].

Damn baby I see they drivin you crazy. Because your body\'s amazing I know you want it to phase me. But hey - I seen a lot of girls, messed up a lot of curls.

Where you needin to be, but believe you me. Baby girl they just gon\' use you up, fuck you and bruise you up. They ain\'t got no family values they ain\'t gon\' choose you up.

Wait, I said that wrong, now let's negotiate,. I wait my banner a piece, won't you take the paper. Pussy nigger, you fake, can't wait for the face to face. Hit you with the cage, back in place,.

I'm going forever be me, never, I'm forever a g.. It's getting hard to survive the streets that eat you alive,. Dumping your body, your cadaver is covered with flies.. Too much rats are trapped inside of your rapping,. Niggers actually laughing at your lights, camera, action.. Do you, do you?. Whatever the fuck you think you gotta do.. 'cause when I bring it to the whole court,. Putting up a play of stats,. While you're hanging with the roaches and rats,. We're way above that.. Now how you're loving that?. Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch.. I can't breathe, can't make it your bitch,. Can't believe how deep in your shit.. Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate.

And miss it after live, use your common sense as a weapon.. If you only knew half of this shit that I've been through,. Shoul've been a screen play when I get to. More niggers away, iet,. Quit playing games in the middle of the street.. Fuck y'all niggers gonna say to me?. We don't play the games, just play for keeps and now. Back for the forth fly,. Back to the back who was back with a tour bus. Get it round the world for a few months,. Down dead, way niggers gotta dumb trunk.. Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate.

foundation,"Verse 1:. When I look you in your eyes I can see my own. Straight love manifested in flesh and bone. You's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit. You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget. Hit back when hit. Use force that's effective. All these bitches and women. Son, please be selective. This is California can't stick your dick in everything. We will survive necessarily by any means. Let no man ever hold you down or supress you. It's the 90's the police just arrest you,. disrespect you on occasion take life. By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight. It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us. When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust. In God we trust but just incase keep it loaded and locked. Ready to rock. Then shake the spot. The Foundation. Verse 2:. You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers. Who forever smoke bud. So it's probably in your blood. Realize you can only run the streets so long. Then the streets run you into the ground then gone. It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong. Same shit different day. It's the same ol' song. If the time ever comes that I meet my match. Take control of my assets. Fuck startin' from scratch. Take care of your mother. Keep yourself on track. Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back. Beware of the serpent. Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike. And try to make you loose sight. Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real. Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill. Son if you ever pull heat. Then use it. If you got a chance to walk away. Then do it. Total domination takes full concentration in all situations. A solid foundation. Verse 3:. You are the foundation. Begining of a new generation. I remember hospital hallway pacin'. I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine. Only to find that yours looked like mine. So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time. In this life you can't press stop. Then press rewind. Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man. Have your own plan, expand your mind. Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs. This is nothing but love. Via sattelite Muggs. Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life. Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife. Be prepared for the worst. But expect the best. No matter where life takes you. Come home to the West. Survival takes more than just gats and guns. That's words to live by. From a father to a son. Foundation."

Will the real X to the Z please stand up?. With my niggaz and my guns, not givin a fuck. Stickin 'em up at point blank range. They say the more things change, they stayin the same. I can't complain. Type of shit that make you wish you was dead. Make you fight the curb, a stomp down on the back of your head. Blow it out like a afro pick. Attract bitches like flies to shit. Pop pills and ride the dick. Niggaz can't swing this quick, I'm Dark McGwire. Bangin shit over the fence with Rottweiler. Listen, niggaz do anything for a dollar, even. killin they own, let it be known, it's like. [Chorus - repeat 2X]. It ain't safe where I'm from. Niggaz start beef never knowin the outcome. Rather be caught with it than caught without one. Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own. [Xzibit]. I'm pullin pistols if you don't break bread. Mr. Wrong Side of the Bed, only get excited for head. Now print this in your industry books. If it wasn't for crooks you niggaz'd still sport the Jordache look. Hit the switch, front to back, side to side. Natural born killers never let shit slide. Never rely on the next man to swing for you. A rock and a hard place, duck between the two. And y'all bitches just somethin to do, don't get it twisted. You're easy like Sunday mornin and shopliftin. It go simple as that, I'm never givin half to a rat. I'd rather bam to your face with a bat. You get tied down to the tracks. Used to make a living cookin coke to crack, now I can't turn back. This is holocaust rap nigga, overreact. and I'ma bring to yo' chest like an asthma attack, ya heard?. [Chorus 1/2]. [Xzibit - repeat 2X]. Oh no, X get drunk and fuck fo' sho'. Please stop runnin yo' mouth let's go. Actin like you've never seen a dick befo'. All these bitches in here."

Yeah, I'm just tryna do this hard work and get this good between us baby, yeah. Look, Samantha, Loraine, Monica, Veronica. Veronica, she treated my dick like a harmonica. How you think I learned how to twist it and turn. Ya back until it's broke, make you feel it in your throat. It was Pamela, Linda, Keisha, Nicole. Had me fuckin while I was drivin on cruise control. Can't wait to get it home and teach it all to you. Look I'm just tryna be the best, I'm doin it all for you. You know that thing with the peanut butter. My Brooklyn bitch said fuck untyin the ropes,. it's faster with a box cutter. I know you love the way I'm diggin you out. But always wanna fuckin aruge so let's figure this out. I'm just tryna make you happy bitch. Who's there for you anytime you get in the mood for suckin a dick. I took the time out to find out what ya like. You bust fifteen nuts, wanna get up and fight. So look. (Chorus). You should thank of all the bitches that I have in my life. All the experience I'm gettin got me fuckin you right. Never took time to see it and plus. All you thinkin 'bout is yourself, I'm thinkin for us. You love the way I beat it down when I come in the house. And all in ya mouth, the bedroom, kitchen and couch. You should thank all of the bitches that I have in my life. All the experience I'm gettin got me fuckin you right. It was Gina, Julie, Renee, Ty and Tammy. Made me spend some extra days in Miami. Candy, Trisha, Prescilla, Melissa. Showed X to the Z it's better with three. Who could fuck your ass better than me (pssst). I think not, hard knock the cock, welcome to my sweat shop. I pick locks made by NFL, NBA, NHL, fuck all day. You could say I didn't do this shit. Unsatisfied bitches gotta go out and chase the dick. And that's just not the thing to do. So I learn new shit from the next bitch and teach it to you. Now don't you love it how I shove it baby (hell yeah). When we be fuckin and we thuggin baby (hell yeah). The way I hit it when I pump it baby (hell yeah). And don't I spit it when I bust it baby (hell yeah). (Chorus). I insist that we fuckin on videotape. Just incase a bitch lose face and try and call rape. If you know somethin that might excite up our late night. Got an open invite to lay us a pipe. Make ya head feel like your wet, warm and tight. I'll go from all night 'til the sun turn bright. Two wrongs don't make it right bitch, no need to cheat. (Pussy just a piece of meat, another means to eat). Big Tray D told me that, as a matter of fact. You only tell me that you love me when you're flat on your back. You wanna leave me now bitch, my fuckin feelings is hurt. Why am I the only one that's tryna make this work. (Chorus). (Tray D talking to fade)."
game face,"I don't fuck around I'll break you down in the hours of H. All these L.A times motherfucka's keepin the pace. No need to pull strings things still get done. To have you yellin at the top of yo lungs. So Xzibit never speak wit a false tounge. Slid off like a handgun. Tryin to build an empire to pass to my grandson. I never like to talk business over the phone. So either have love for the game or leave it alone. Plus action speak louder than words. And pussy move faster than birds. So I gotta keep a gameface. On the street you slip, and you might catch a hot one. Xzibit stay low and kick back like a shotgun. I keep it bangin to the end of the line. When a rapper think his saggin style is fuckin with mine, it's divine. Cuz my family is harder than bricks. Anything to keep it movin cuz it's harder to hit. Chorus:. (Ras Kass). Only right I fuck wit you when you fuckin' wit mine. Keep it movin to the end of the line. And action speak louder than words. And pussy move faster than birds. Gotta keep a gameface. (Xzibit). Only right I fuck wit you when you fuckin' wit mine. Keep it movin to the end of the line. And action speak louder than words. And pussy move faster than birds. Gotta keep a gameface. Verse 2: Ras Kass. Men must be either tramp or the crutch. To regulate, relegate, delegate power, nigga touch something. Trust no one and die dumping. Drained ya battery you barely talking like Teddy Ruxpin. See that's wassup, nigga I don't give a fuck. Say some shit so nasty, it'll make Little Kim blush. As if, a 98 bentley didn't tempt me. To lay bullshit over this empty. But consequently my conscience wouldn't permit me. I'm one-third black man, one-third Jackie Chan. One-third sand, shiftin across the surface of the land. Golden State Warrior let my nuts hang like niggas in nooses. While you givin groupies all your loochie. I'm known for fucking hoochies in suskis. And slippin ???????. Loved and feared, severe yet loved. The full time titan fighting three million over night thugs. So keep your, hand out your rectum 'cause you can't stop shit. Don't rock shit, studio hustlers. claimin' they got more keys than a locksmith. What part of the game is this. Bonus Round, give me the mic, the money. The pussy in that order, the mortar over populated. get fucked and orally copulated. And all you chumps on some you owe me an apology shit. can suck yo apology out my dick. Chorus:. Verse 3:. (Ras Kass). This is for the black niggas, the yak sippers. The part time strippers,slash full time student,and fifty buck slippers. I got athletes feet,we run these contrete streets. Sporting cleets, ain't nothing sweet. (Xzibit). I'm making rappers get they shit together. Still smokin, still drinkin, still maintain clear thinkin. Everyday is the weekend, mashin thru in a lincoln. And style so sick, the whole car start stinking. Chorus:."
get fucked up with me,"Yeah man, I'm glad to have this opportunity. cuz I never get to sit down and chop it with y'all. Man, face to face, so you know I definitely wanna get fucked up.

You mind if I smoke? well, alright. [Verse 1]. (*Inhales*) So let me introduce myself. X to the motherfuckin Z (*exhales*). I had to introduce myself appropriately. I'm that nigga you was hoping to see, fall flat on my ace. Look respect then fall from grace. But you know, (*inhales*) things move slow. I refuse to lose the game like dude from blow (*exhales*). Like it ain't crazy enough, huh. My life got ups and downs like an all night fuck,so what (*inhales*). Y'all really want from me (*exhales*). I'm trying to live with two hoes like three's company. Ask me what is success. Nigga, success is when your no mean no and your yes means yes. And you can stand by your word cuz your word is your balls. (*Inhales*) Lose one your losing them all (*exhales*). All hail to alcohol. Cuz it's my turn now try again tomorrow. [Chorus]. Roll another blenny up, pour another drink. I want everybody to get fucked up with me. Get a glass and fill it up. Lick the philly, seal it up. Everybody get fucked up with me. Roll another blenny up, pour another drink. I want everybody to get fucked up with me. Get a glass and fill it up. Lick the philly, seal it up. Everybody get fucked up with me. [Verse 2]. Life's a real bitch sometimes (*coughing*) oh shit! (*coughing*) wait. Okay I got it (*coughing*) I got it, I got it (*coughing*) I got it, hold up. Life's a real bitch sometimes. Your heartbeat raising like the rate of the crime. I could probably turn water to wine. Restless, double platinum, it's the sign of the time. It ain't my fault, your kids wanna c-walk. Dress how we dress and talk like we talk (*inhales*). Ask Miss Cleo (*exhales*) if this is the matrix, I'm Neo. This is dedicated to that female CEO. That sucked my brother's dick for jolly St. Nick. Shit (*inhales*) make some room (*exhales*). Somebody laced this shit with shrooms, cuz I'm flying. [Chorus]. (*Inhales*) What's the big deal (*exhales*). Couple of (*pause*) shootings, couple of (*pause*) get killed. Happens everyday around this way. Took my homie lil' Mo dog and blew him away. Shit (*inhales*) at the age of 19, what a bummer'. Another crazy ass summer. These types of things never die down easy. Gang of retaliation, homeboy believe me (*inhales*). Fien for the recipe (*coughing*). Man, these blunts gon' be the death of me. Fuck it, next flight to Amsterdam. A few girls, fifty grand and a handy cam. Posted up at the Cypress Hill coffee shop. I'm miraculous, fuckin unorthodox (*inhales*). I'm glad we could chop it up. Before I bounce let me get a blunt (*exhales*). [Chorus]"
get your walk on,"(Yeah) I can drink a whole Henessey fifth. Some call that a problem but I call it a gift. Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah). Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory. A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct. Bitch niggaz continue to floss and lip-sync. And I'ma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat. Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope. Don't make my desert eagle barrel touch the back of your throat. Always approach niggaz that's known for killin your folks. Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all. Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall. Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags. No retaliation you basically runnin with fags. In these streets, you only good as your last transaction. Funny style, and these niggaz ain't laughin. Y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero. Think life is a video for ""Last Action Heroes"". Face the price you pay for the games you play. When it's all said and done at the end of the day, you gotta. [Chorus - repeat 2X]. Get your walk on, get your head right. I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right. Get your bounce on, back dat ass up. Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up. [Xzibit]. Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed. When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift. Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock. Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop. It's the best thing crackin my nigga. Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver. From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags. earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas. Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah). You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah). Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket. Mailed your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid. Drastic measures we take just to get by. for all the shit you gotta go through to get high. Stand by, do or die for the West coast. Wanna fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Tell y'all people to call my people. Recognize all men are not created equal. I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through. Only the kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!). When I get through the world'll be a better place. A little Jesus Christ mixed with some Leatherface. Go find some punch to spike, find some dope to lace. Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space. Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit. or hit so hard to the chin it make your back flip. My transcript number one up in this conference. It's nonsense, all y'all niggaz want is conflict. Only associate with pros and the convicts. Xzibit roll up in the spot with a bomb bitch. and then bounce with a couple, motherfuck a tussle. You never have enough muscle to stop a nigga hustle. [Chorus - 2X]."

It was all a dream. came to California at seventeen. little nigga tryna bubble up from the crack scene. it got so complicated, then I graduated. haters so mad I made it. how could I fly so high only to feel so low. how do they live so fast only to grow so slow. like when you short no support for your kids. but got money for marijauna just to smoke with your friends. or that woman who survives and beats cancer. only to be drowned in debt with no answers. the frequency of tragedy it happens so rapidly. that we became numb, we embraced this insanity. some wack job hauled off and smoke his whole family. reality TV thats not based in reality. stuck watching train wrecks everybody going for self. self worth prison point but for money and wealth. this mentality of me, fuck everything else. its a virus, a disease Ifm a victim myself. but I swear before I leave Ifma fix it I swear. Ifma fix it I swear. yo you better beware. Rich boy kill his own wife knocks her teeth out. cuts her fingers off than escape with a suicide. the king of pop died, Michael Vick was fighting dogs. but he walked and did his time let him throw the fucking ball. As the markers keep crashing and people get desperate. putting faith in the false feeling so disrespected. turn to this record the highest form of understanding. understand me, fight a flight for your family (come). walk with a soldier (come). talk with a soldier. centerblocks stop shooting straight from the shoulder. as we all get older and hope falls over. and damn you was 6 years sober. and just like that now you back were you started square one. and you canft bring it back when that bullet leave the gun. as the planet get smaller, prepare for the North American Union. an anvil to replace your dollars. narcisistic society love paparazzi. get the starbucks for your overpriced latte. ignoring all the signs, nevermind is your mindstate. until the end of time, shit is closer than you think man.. [Trick Trick:]. Ifve done been in situations where the only thing that I can do is read the Bible. went to the [?] where a piece of metal the only way of survival. made up my mind that I donft ever want to return. chance was given again now Ifm back out in the World. made a promise to God but living in sin. I can never lie to God but itfs so hard to live right. Ifm carrying 7 point 62Œs to fist fights. aint nobody playing fair they cheat no cheat. way finna be the topic for the preachers Eulogy speaking. the word say ""turn the other cheek"" thats what they teach us. but Peter sliced the ear off a nigga rollinf on Jesus. I donft wanna pause Ifm doing what Ifm supposed to do. Ifm a real nigga one from a million chosen few. everlasting pain has got my brain like its trapped inside a maze. have you been unfaithful to the game (damn shame). 18 years you never beleived him thats yo son. go and see him muthafucker. you fucked his mother. the God Damn common courtesy never applied to you. cause you thought she lied to you. you couldnt see your own mother in his face. if you die hefll be in a better place. bring the tape back"
handle your business,"Xzibit]. Yeah, uh, what, worldwide. Yeah, Im forever, ever lastin, spread the wealth. Procrastination like masturbation, your fuckin yourself. So we gonna move on em quickly (what). No chance to think about coming back. Chain smoke em, turn they lungs black. See I was raised to love black, but sometimes. Black folks wanna sweat you harder than the one-time. Never participate in dumb, def and blind shit. Plus I got my little man, so daily I'm reminded. The ride only gets rougher (right). But I'll be damned if me and my niggas suffer. Smuggle this motherucker with the raw shit, I'm blessed wit. Lookin at the world, burned for the young and the desperate. Showed heart, but got cardiac arrested. More than a nigga with an image and a press kit. The wreck hits, creates desert land, desolate. The whole intent to rock the shit, keep the herb lit. Chorus: Xzibit (Defari). Handle your business before your business handles you. Mister X to the Z (and Defari Herut), one two. (Remain true, regardless what we go through). Yeah, handle your business so you can stand on your on two. *repeat*. [Defari Herut]. Everyday I puts in down in LA, hustle in this. Assassin lyricist, serious, muscle in this. I call the bets, I know we got coordinates on more games to wreck. We blaze shows, never no Half Step. Tactics, B-Boys, no games no antics. No false images, no bullshit semantics. We planned this, for hundred of thousands. Reignin/Rainin on they brains with lyrics, from the mountains. Don't contemplate what you can't even demostrate. Defari lottery draftpick, never the second rate. Nigga who wanna hate but front like its all great. I gots no time for these emotional niggas, I gots to motivate. Moves to make, best rhyme straight. That's for the old school, this here's our year, it's time to elevate. Handle this, don't hesitate got money to make. Push maximum levels from the Golden State. Chorus. [Defari Herut]. This combination's high calibre. Hatians stay amazed and confused like this was algebra. I'm scoutin the, best land for property. Never sloppily, picture someone stoppin me. From gettin mine, line after line. And you wonder why I call these fake niggas Miller. they think they Genuine; I'm startin to shine, imported Italian. With a custom made Herut charm as my medallion. [Xzibit]. Seem like, I recite the same prayer every night. Watch my folks, make sure my dogs stay tight. And fully prepared to gunfight in broad daylight. Till then, lick it to the chin, let it begin. We could break bread or break skin; and watch me send it. Try not to break the law, sometimes I gotta bend it. And my directions, suggest for your own protection. You motherfuckers keep it movin like an intersection. Chorus. Serious business *scratched in background*. Fuck you, like that Mr. X to the Z, Defari Herut. Yeah, yeah right? *3X*. What, keep it movin like this y'all."
handle your time,"[Convict 2/Sadat X]. Oh my goodness! Look what they sendin through nowadays. Ah, it's a light-weight. And he got a smirk on his face like it's all of that. Yeah, well we gone see what it is. [Convict 1/Xzibit]. What you in for, everything under the sun. Recently, got me first degree wit a hot gun. That's my third strike, so Xzibit can't go home. Fight to see Daylight like Sylvester Stallone. Don't ask too many questions nigga, keep that on the d-low. My family might mistake you for an undercover C-O. Last one that tried didn't make it past bookin. Five times in the neck when everybody was lookin. [Convict 2/Sadat X]. You see the judge, but he don't budge. That's you're third felony, I believe strike three. Remanded and stranded, to the cold steel granite. Lost to the world, your moms and your girl. Keep your weight up, or your ass get ate up. Cats is stickin, straight up. Wit the shank, get more time in the tank. Ask Hank, he bout to bank, killed a cop wit high rank. They gave him life and now another cat is fuckin his wife. [Convict 1/Xzibit]. Just because I'm locked down don't mean the hustlin stop. Her-oine and beer joints twenty dollars a pop. You a new recruit, so today I'm lettin you slide. But tomorrow you'll be confronted wit the two's in the side. If you a smart mothafucker, you'll be fallin wit mine. Behind bars, no bitches and cars, we only got time. We're I'm from, time is money and got neither to waste. Once in a while catch a Cannanite in the wrong place. BEAT HIM DOWN, break the strongest hand, piss in his face. Strike fear, play the rear, 'fore he catchin a case. Low-class, got a dozen free visitors pass. Plus the female C-Order wanna give me some ass. Chorus [Sadat X] 2x. This is your new home boss, where you survive at all costs. And if you don't, well it's only your loss. You're only here cuz you tried to force and be the boss, ha. Handle your time like a man yo. [Convict 1/Xzibit]. So it's my twenty-third birthday, drinkin brew-no. You know no matter what it take, we gotta celebrate. Fuck stayin straight, hair braided by this Muslim cat. Regulate the whole yard, now we got the straps. Niggas say ""Who the fuck is that?"". The X-Man, rowdy, gettin treated like the feds in the county. Correctional facilities, basically you don't wanna fuck wit these. Murders and felonies keep you company (""YEAH!""). [Convict 3/Kid Creole]. And yes y'all, come on in (""YEAH""). All you brand new heffer, sissy, soft booty-ass shook niggas (""YEAH""). Yeah bitch, welcom to central booking (""YEAH""). A sleep-over for pimps, private hustlers (""YEAH""), drug slingers, and gun. clappers. Even bitch-ass, shook-ass niggas (""YEAH"") like y'all. Get on your ?(""YEAH""), get out the blood on your ?married character?. Kitten-ass faces (""YEAH""), niggas about to beat you all down to the last stop. *echoes*. [Convict 2/Sadat X]. I'm all good, as I telephone my hood. At first I was shook, tried to play by the book. But you can't bid your time by stayin in the cell. I'm gettin high everyday like I was still on the corner. Where I'm in fat pink caps, New York to California. Makin deals for mills, holdin cigarette lottos. Givin cats pills, and tell em ""Yo try those!"". Niggas try to scheme but my team is tight. We as shady as the night and bring fright to sight. Hey you be aight, but don't act like a sucka. Ain't you ain't got to be the wildest mothafucker. Use control, put a cat in whole if he's broke. And let em know, I just wanna serve my time and go. And flow, lay low, try to grab some dough. Aiyyo I ain't tryin to jail, somebody post my bail. Chorus. [Convict 2/Sadat X] (Convict 3/Kid Creole). Yo man shhh, I need some new kicks man. (Oh what? Oh shut the fuck up!). Somebody got some at least some money man (Nigga what!). Or something man, I ain't get no letters man. (You gone be my bitch tonight, what). Niggas forgettin about me man. (I'll poke y'all, don't come on the island). Namsayin, supposed to be my crew. (Don't be on the island when I get there). Can't even make collect phone calls. (Mothafucker, what ah um!). Tryin to jam my collect calls now. (You will be mines tonight mothafucker!). Nobody ain't home, nobody wanna write me (Mine you hear me!). I ain't got nuttin to read, yaknamsayin. (You'll be mine tonight mothafucker!). Ain't nobody put no money on my book. (Don't fall asleep tonight bitch!). It's like I'm starvin in here. This ain't no fun."

That's why we filthy rich behind the scenes. Game spitters with helmets and shoulder pads on the hitters. Bullshit so far what this game sent. We here to burn it down open bar entertainment. Taking the work clipping the clientele on raw. Lactose intolerant but I still sell. Game enough to mash on the coach like Sprewell. Don't salt there hoes flows ain't got that sea smell. Overstand under surveillance, Ben Savage-. Can't come to the town terrorizing we been Laden. Been beat heavyweight beefs and went passage. Back to the blockmates and it's safe to unlock cakes.

heart of a man,"[Xzibit]. Ain't a damn thing promised to ya. Except livin your life, and dyin one day, I'm just bein honest to ya. It take a whole lot, just to get a little. Gettin caught up in the middle the answer to life's riddles. never, come that easy, but it was easy. to lead me, but it wasn't easy to see me. Get up off the block to the TV. And sell a couple million CD's, best believe me. You see these callouses on my soul?. Couldn't let hate and paralysis, take control. I pick you up when you down 'til I can't no mo'. My name sting in your mouth like canker sores. Been at war my whole life, sleepless nights. Endless fights, but still can't walk to the light. Cause my work ain't finished on earth, for what it's worth. From the cradle to the hearse, God and family first, for real. [Chorus: singer]. Somewhere in the heart of man (somewhere, within, somewhere). There comes a time when he must understand (when he must understand). The strong withstand, the weak will fall {*repeat*}. Cause tomorrow may not come at all {*repeat*}. [Xzibit]. Life ain't long, it's more like a snapshot. You can have the top, I live for the hop. Never take a day I'm breathin on this planet for granted. Time for change, time for growth, peace understandin. See but niggaz keep forcin my hand, disturbin my plans. Bringin out the soldier in a peaceful man. It's like tryin to build a house on sand; you never get. a solid foundation, one man can change the nation. Yo I put that on all creation; Haitian, Jamaican. African, Asian, Caucausian, Indian. Whatever your persuasion, this is the message. Time is of essence especially when you're countin your blessings. Lessons learned from the deepest of pain, it's not a game. Keep my name outta your mouth and I'ma keep it the same, ya dig?. It's a shame, graduated to the rap game. Only to find out crack and rap was the same thang, damn!!. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Who got skill? Who got hustle?. Who got they family with 'em? Who pay for they muscle?. Yo it's all gon' come out in the wash, the lost angel. with dirty wings, bullets ricochet off my halo. I lay low for no one, I love my life. Ain't afraid of no hard work and sacrifice. Was born twice through the life of my seed. Makin sure he see a side of life, I was never able to see. Hittin home like ""Ground Zero,"" move over now. Peace to the real heroes, still underground. I put it down for the homies that came that's hard in the paint. I'm livin proof it's never to late, you straight. Once in a while I go back to the main strip. And see the same niggaz still doin the same shit. And all I can do is increase the flow. Put it out, let it soak in, and hope they grow, c'mon. [Chorus] - repeat 2X."

So it's one fifteen in the mornin I'm comin up, a hard day, serve. We gettin drunk smokin herb and the third dike you roll. Non-stop cash flow, 20,000 dollars and the rest cuttin yayo. We had the rocks, my nigga late to pick it up. get him on the phone, hurry up cause I ain't tryin to get stuck. So what the fuck is the hold up?. (""Nigga sit your ass in the chair and I'll be right there""). Reminds me I gotta shake the spot. I got bitches in the hotel room ready for me to bang cob weight (*knock*). Yo, who is that man?. (""He wanna spend a couple of hundred, (yeah), but he'll be right back""). That's when I shoulda got the heater. But I was too busy in the kitchen countin money and takin shots at Tequila. Started countin out twelve when it hit me. If you was Rocksteady, you woulda came when the C-Note's rang. Before I could yell out to lock the front. Niggas rushed in the front door with the gauge, ready, duck. Bad enough I'm caught up in it, jacked, but worst than that. I'm caught in the kitchen without the strap. (""Where the muh-fuckin sack homeboy?""). Yeah, woulda killed Terminators only D between us is. a stove and a refrigerator, came in and put the gauge to my chest. Took the money off the table and said (""Yo, where's the rest of it nigga?""). You gotta love it, came straight to the moneyman. 20,000 cash, needed stacks, wrapped in rubber bands. Snatched the whole shit and broke out. I ran to the living room and got the heat from under the couch. Smashed out into the middle of the street started blastin. Dumpin at the getaway cars but they was mashin. I thought I heard the homies just in time for the action. Police hit the corner with they reds and white's flashin. These niggas rolled off with at least a cool fifty. Ya, I'm in handcuffs on the ground and mad cause the K-9 bit me. Shipped me off downtown for the bookin. Threw my herb sack when the cops wasn't lookin. Fingerprints, hold the tape, hear come detectors. One at the door, another one askin questions. Stupid shit like: - ""Who was I shootin at?"". Was it game related and where do they kick it at?. But I didn't say shit I can tell from all the people. Involved it was an inside job. But I'm the wrong nigga to rob, I'll hunt you down. Fuck the money, I'll take you off and accept the loss. Set bail at fifteen g's, no sweat. Got cars slippin tonight, and almost got wet. Homies come to set bail see, but that's all right. Since I'm already here I'ma spend the night. (Outro: Xzibit and another having a conversation). (""Hey, hey I need to use the phone again"") (*Car horns*). (""Ay, ay man"") (""Since when did you start takin shoestrings and shit?"") (""Man""). (""Ahhhh"") (""Do I look like I wanna kill?"") (""Ay man, fuck that""). (""Ay, look?) (""I just need to use the phone real quick man, eh, fuck it""). (""Aight, ay, let me get the top bunk""). (""Ay man, this, this, this blanket, this blanket smell like urine man""). All right, you're charged with Public Intoxication. (All right, listen there's a thousand people down there who are drunk). Okay, I understand that."

We should part ways \'fore somebody catch a homicide. Recognize, lost of a lot of love when my momma died. Did a gang of shhhhit, I\'m surprised that I\'m still alive. Fishburn yellin wake up, open up my eyes. Don\'t believe them lies from them guys that you idolize. Ridicule, try to downplay, try to minimize. And criticize when you on your grind so I realized. [Chorus: Jelly Roll]. This cannot continue, we must go our separate waaaaays. Without you I\'ll do better, but first these words I have to saaaaay. It\'s not that I don\'t hear you, when you scream and curse my naaaaame. It\'s just that I don\'t feel you, nigga you invadin my spaaaaace. [Xzibit]. Go ahead spit it out, that\'s right, get it out. So I can respond, nigga FUCK what you talk about. Drop like a guillotine, money over everything. seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine. Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit. Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship. Came a long way from the place that I started from. Ever seen a man\'s last breath beaten out of him?. Hate manifest from the inside out. The shit starts in your heart then spill out your mouth. I\'m the odd man out, watch it all pan out. I see you tryin to stand up but you don\'t stand out (ha ha ha!). Now that I found that my path is original. Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle (yeah). I\'m not like you, but you think we identical. It\'s pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Three wheels lock it up, ammo stock it up. It\'s not for niggaz cause George Bush comin after us. That\'s why it\'s time to roll, get where I gotta go. All my people fightin for they soul, you are not alone. Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant. Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it. Here\'s a little tidbit, X rock that real shit. Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, over kill shit. Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize. Put you on track where you just, you was out of line. And I ain\'t got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit. You know that young shit, the \""Hey nigga where you from\"" shit. Even though the pistol in my hand, I\'m a businessman. People grow apart, don\'t expect you to understand. Let\'s part ways and, then pray for better days. I realize somebody \'bout to die, so I came to SAY. [Chorus]. [Xzibit + (Jelly Roll)]. Yeah, knowhatI\'msayin? (you invadin my spaaaaace). Yeah, stop askin where the fuck I\'m at. Yeah (nigga you invadin my spaaaaace). Tryin to see where I\'m at, tryin to be where I\'m at all the fuckin time. C\'mon (you invadin my spaaaaace). Get a life nigga, heheheh.

judgement day,"(Ohhhh, yeah yeah yeah yeah). [Chorus: singers]. You can turn your back and then walk away. (You can turn your back and then walk away). Soon be comin the judgement day. (Ahh, soon there be comin the judgement day). Yes, uhh, breathe with me. C'mon.. listen, yo. I know you're fed up, feel like you can't get up. Have faith, stay strong, keep your head up. Yo, it only gets worse; we in a world. where your status and your bank account determine your. worth. There's no time to rehearse, the clock been tickin. cause we all started dyin at birth, I speak the truth. and it hurts. It felt like I was dyin of thirst. 'til I was blessed with my voice, I move mountains. with verse. The worst thing you ever seen in your life, ""The. Passion of Christ"". Pregnant chicks buyin rock, hittin the pipe. It ain't like I ain't tried to tell ya; misery love. company. Keepin the wrong company brings failure. Cause people use people like paraphenalia. With a scam, with a scheme, with a dream to sell ya. But I ain't got nothin but love for all my soldiers. and thugs. To all of my women, we gotta keep livin, c'mon. [Chorus]. Yeah! C'mon. Mr. X to the Z had to raise the stakes. Had to touch my people like T.D. Jakes. On the ground like a nigga flippin crumbs to cake. I won't stop like an eighteen wheeler with no brakes. Bein dipped in her-on so each CD's weight. Niggaz be fake, they speak what they can't create. (create). You won't, see me break, I'm built for a tough frame. One-eighty-five and I'm still on huff. I was only 15, tryin to pass that rock. Never got caught, just sat down, collected my. thoughts. This is bullshit, I ain't got a plane or a boat. I'm just another nigga sellin some coke, y'know?. Had to grab life right by the throat, murder I wrote. My callin for ballin wasn't pedalin dope. It was oversea convoys, bangin out cuts. No police or government agency lockin me up, so what?. [Chorus]. C'mon... What do you believe in? I believe in karma. And that fo'-five to drop that drama. Can't wait for the time when I meet my maker. Picture everlasting life in Jamaica, time to wake up. Watch your thoughts, your thoughts become words. Your words become actions when the bullshit happens. Keep laughin, that's when the gauge start clackin. Feel the buckshots smackin have your body mismatchin. Yo, I feel the devil tryin to force my hand. Steady bringin out the soldier in a peaceful man. See I was born to be all that I can, without a Uncle. named Sam. As you can see we just a part of his plan. Cause first there was a war on blacks. And then there was a war on crack, now it's war in. Iraq, c'mon. I never give up, I only give back. I ain't preachin I'm just statin the facts. So let the choir SING!. [Chorus]. . Zéhh"

With hand cuffs plus. In got we trust but don't trust us, we just. Add to the ashes, then pick up the dust. Like that. [J-Ro]. I make it seem. Like you havin bad dreams. Have you wakin up out your sleep. By your own screams. Xzibit has arrived Goddamit. [Xzibit]. We bout to rock the whole planet. And bitch niggas can't stand it. Try to play the back and look intense.

I impregnate WAX, so get mine regardless. Of anybody's set, I'm starving the artist. Who's next to me? The X to Z. Together we bomb MCs with text debris. Leaving y'all hard pressed to breath. Other words, nigga's show love and chicks spit the ecstasy. How real is that?. CHORUS [Saukrates] {Xzibit}. I keep it moving and moving, keep it going, going like that y'all. {Like that y'all}, like that. {I keep it moving and moving, keep it going, going like that y'all}. Like that y'all. [Xzibit]. See I put the beated nigga, ask him if he's had enough. Tan khakis, T-shirt, wife beater tatted up. Looking for props. How you explain to nigga drinking beer to the bottom that they can't come up. Mother fucker say what?. Stack loot so much, reach out and touch you probably die from the paper cuts. I see you lazy fucks, sceming on the speed demon. Keep on dreaming, give me any type of reason. To stop your breathing, yeah it' me against the world. 'Cause the eyes deceiving, anybody want to bet me. Saukrates, bouncing wide like a jet ski. Meet a bitch who ain't hard stick like Wayne Gretzky. Look I try to live where the Lolos and the sets be. I still roll dolo, how a normal nigga test me.

With that fake rap, break that 'fore cats react. To your shallow ass shit, go practice. Saukrates never making wack shit, trust me son. If I'm eating, my dogs eating. Use experience for teaching without preaching. Each, and everyday I be thinking about my future. Preparing for the new world we ain't used to. Handle that, with supreme caution. Peep this mental distortion. Hitting you with grips of funk by the portions. Consulting with killers could lead to abortion. Face down in a closed coffin, WHAT!. CHORUS x2. [OUTRO: Xzibit].

Cause suckers shake, while I'm creatin. They get together and they start to hatin. How can we take him out one time. cause he brought back the West with the freshest rhymes. I might go first, and he'll go second. I'll wreck 'em, deck 'em, set it, just checkin your mic. Droppin hot shit I like. So throw up your hands bitch, run your ice. Cause I'll go third, and he'll go fourth. By the fifth eat shit, you'll step off. Six is your beatdown, your title is seven. Takin out your four man crew makes eleven. By the twelveth I go for self. Rockin L.A. like no one else... You can check any rapper from the underground scene. but few have dropped hot shit and seen green. Some have dope twelve inches, count 'em. But not many niggaz have slammin albums. X to the Z rocks consistantly. I'm ""Criminal Minded"" so don't fuck with me. Why? Well that's my secret baby. I don't take shit, so fuck you, pay me. So you can call me, a public servant. Not a king but a teacher I believe I've earned it. So I just walk, or ride my bike. and bust on the +Up In Smoke+ stage tonight. Give me a chance and I'll rock the house. But let a motherfucker try to take me out. Cause male or female, I will strangle. If it's a label, they have to untangle. Adidas, chains, jerseys, braids. Bandanas hangin off the end of my gauge. Step right up if that's what you like. but watch your bitch, I catch hoes like a dyke. In the night at a height right for flight.

likwit connection,"""But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection""(sample) 2x. [Defari]. Don't regret it, you had your chance and couldn't set it. You hear me rhyme and try to shine on my time, forget it. Hear me on radio, live vocally do edits. E-Swift scratchin and threading, with supreme unleaded. Only the best out the Likwit Crew out the west. And we shine time after time writting lyri-gets. On freshly buffed and waxed marble steps. Defari got a stlye that's iller than Tourrettes. Make you switch, make a bitch get undressed. Make people in the club wanna dance chest to chest. Bruised falcon, strive for perfection like Malcolm. Back the name wit potential, but now they know the outcome. So now the ticket's weakened, I stay away from tricks. Defari, Phil Da Agony, Xzibit, and Tha Liks. ""The world's"" ""But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection"". [Phil Da Agony]. Yo, talk a big game, play a big game. You know my motherfuckin name. Phil Da Agony, it's all the same same. Game tight, Crescent Heights, get the name right. I do seven songs in the same night. Work ethic, proper etiquette, the better shit. I want my gold plaque for this shit. Soon as the stores get it (you get it). Focused Daily, Likwit activity. Phil Da Agony causing you total tragedy. [Xzibit]. My chest is burning from the Hennesy rock. Yo I live to see the enemy drop. The safety night got Kennedy shot. It's political, the way I smash down is pitiful. Situation critical, barely breathin in a hospital. Dead meat, we give it like professional athletes. The elite wit a chick for everyday of the week. I'm talking Monday through Sunday. Models walkin up and down the runway. I take a lethal role in the gunplay. To finish wit flyin colors, Tha Alkaholik brothers. Connected, respect it, ain't no choice but to love us. It's not, east to west, I want the whole world behind me. I got niggas in L.A. sayin ""Fuck Guiliani"". [Tash]. I'm hella-cocky on the mic, I fuck it up on jeep beats. So while you rockin to this beat, the beat is rockin to me.

You're not as famous, as the Likwit entertainers. ""The world's famous"" But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection (2x). [J-Ro]. It's the Likwit coalition, start the mission. We gonna turn this into a tradition. My b-boy stance is updated, I feel like we made it. Even though we underrated. Yo, it's to the Ro, act a fool over flow. I got the uncanny ability to cold rock a show. I got fired from my job cuz I was late to my shift. Cuz I was drinkin a fifth, wit John Jingle Heimer Smith. And here's another caper from the lyric landscaper. I write flows wit two by fo's wit sand paper. Now what is a MC if he can't flow. Up next is E-Swift and my name is J-Ro. [E-Swift]. We don't give a fuck if you down wit such and such. You can still get touched, by the Likwit bumrush. Better train hard before you face me. You better off fightin Royce Gracey. To get me out that ass you gotta mace me. I make MCs wanna tap out, before I blow they back out. Likwit niggas winnin every bout. Rippin MCs like cheap jeans. Fuck your DJ and your mainstream production team. And if you sleepin on us, then sweet dreams. Cuz when you ain't lookin we be bookin mad shows makin cream. My profession is killin studio sessions wit no question (what's that). It's the Likwit Crew Connection. ""The world's famous"" ""But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection"" (7x)."

Like a nigga with a mask and a gun, hold up. Rappers act like they ain't gon' die for small fry. Try to reply, don't touch what you ain't gon' buy. I ain't gon' lie, motherfucker love to get high. Barely get by with scraps and pennies. Now we winnin Grammy's and Emmy's. And party with the henni and remi. Got a big bang theory nigga keepin it hot. Its the art versus ??? or not.

There's two sides of my family, both sides from the ghetto. Pops Finnish choco-late, moms Mississippi yellow. Caramel, Cherokee black man, with a pedigree of excellence.

Good ol' wrangler in his day with that attitude of ""Fuck ya"". [Xzibit]. Built to run forever, X the infinite. First line of defense to smash through the immigrants.

I can't complain through the year's mama I've been stressed. Through them bullets and the bad times I've been blessed. For the times that I fail but I tried my best. Able to do for my loved one's, real success. Your the source of my strength I was blessed with your gifts. Your insights, your wisdom, your penmanship. Fun n games, I'm doing thangs, I know you wouldn't agree with. What I drink, what I smoke, who I be with. You made sure I got some love when there wasn't none. Opened up my heart showed the world where I'm coming from. Your little grandson is just like your little boy. Mama what you built here no man can ever destroy, your bundle of joy. I've been through so much. I lose touch and sometimes I feel that life sucks. My women try to get close I push here away. She wanna talk I just sit there with nothing to say. Feel me its all the pain I contain on the inside. You in the right place but left me at the wrong time. Use to cook, clean, and sing me to sleep. Now I only go to bed with my heat, damn I miss you. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. The school of hard knocks where I learned life's lessons. With not enough answers and too many questions. When you had me you gave birth to a soldier. Now I'm much older now the world much colder. Our lives in the hands of politicians that don't care. We ponds in the game biological warfare. The family's so spread out n disconnected. Trying to hold things together put my soul on records. It's hard; you know your daughter had a baby too. A beautiful baby girl just another little piece of you. Another branch we can add to the family tree. Responsibility bringing out the man in me. You ain't a man if your not taking care of home. Raise and protect my own, until they full-grown. No matter how much these streets try to change me. I'm never 'gon forget how you raised me. I Love You, Forever.. [Chorus]. [Ad Libs]. Yeah, all the mothers, all the daughters, yeah, come on. Sun, Moon, Earth, yeah, this for you, uh, Damn, Damn I Miss You."

You thought I was about to start right there right?. Y'all motherfuckers turn this shit up, it's X to the motherfucking Z. Yeah...Ha, welcome to my planet... [Verse 1]. Some things money just can't buy. From what I seen now that's a God damn lie. Been involved in some other shit, ran from the government. Landed the mother ship, thanks for the ride. My niggaz still bang like the wrath of Cain. Fast lane, smack ya bodyguard and take ya chain. And it's all in another day's work for me. I spit the truth, the truth gone set y'all free SO-. What's my anti-drug? Drugs!. Anti-drugs is when I can't get none, for fun. I drop flows, punk the punk rappers. Load clips for nines and clap with gun clappers. Listen, too many motherfucking cooks in ya kitchen. Missin' the most important part of life 'cause you bitchin'. Bitchin' so much you should tuck ya nuts. And dick between ya thighs and color your eyes. And wax your legs and buy some bras and thongs. And go crazy in the nightclub for sisqo's songs. You a hook motherfucker with the Jordache look. Bring lead with ya heat so the beef can cook. [Chorus: Xzibit]. Who's sticking to the script like pistol grip?. Xzibit, tradition of X-cellence. Hit 'em up, this westside G.S.B.

Now that we winning motherfuckers aim to get us. The game is vicious constant hostile conditions. For the times I dropped Jewels and nobody would listen (nope). A new position, got a couple of pots to piss in. Got the aim of Oswald nigga I ain't missin'. If everybody eating' who the fuck gone clean the kitchen. I got vision, and a real deep suspicion. About a lot of rappers reps and they street conditions. Everybody got bricks of yay, claim they do crimes that pay. And tell you that it paved the way (BULLSHIT!). Well only a few niggaz really came up this way. With gunplay day-to-day quick to blow you away. Trying to sound like snoop, trying to ball like Dre. I just think you mutherfuckers ain't got shit to say. [Chorus: Xzibit]. Who's sticking to the script like pistol grip?. Xzibit, tradition of X-cellence. Hit 'em up, this westside G.S.B. Openbar all night drinks for free. Victory 'cause we make history. niggaz actually have the audasity. We the shit from the get and we set to win. Straight hard on a bitch y'all sensative. (singing).

Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me. I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby. if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me. to do war, and try to bring my crew back down. I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now. I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out. With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now. [Xzibit]. Let's see who got they city on lock. Let's see who got the better aim with the glock. Let's see who come out on top. Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets. Let's see who wanna die the same time as me. and make ends meet. Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?. I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse. And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri. Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now. [Chorus: Nate Dogg]. I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name. Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain. Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same. Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain. Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game. Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain. I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain. Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name. [Xzibit]. Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin. Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me. How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me. There'd be no West coast without me. Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival. And now you tryin to act like my rival?. Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth. Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth. all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony). All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy). Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now. I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile. Threaten my life? (C'mon!)

[Chorus]. [Eminem]. I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him. Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him. I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him. I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him. purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels. I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you. But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you. I ""Square Dance"" cause I'm sick of rappin circles. around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out. It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow. You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out. You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon. (I) No gangsta you ain't either. (Will) But I know that I spit ""Ether"". (Not) I shoulda crossed your belly. (Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly. X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass.

Set sail for tour ever since eighty-nine. so y'all are fuckin the same hoes who used to be mine. [Tash]. And I've been waitin three summers to rhyme longside my people. Rico, De La, inject you with the lethal. dose of hop-hippin if you thought CaTash was slippin. then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sippin. CaTash put the dip in dip dive socialize. Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized. [Xzibit]. Yo you better recognize and try to analyze this. Hand over fist - how can a man act like a bitch?. Change and switch, snitch on his crew. Yo get rid of the niggaz before the same thing happen to you. [Pos]. And they'll leave your ass sticky like glue. Blood leakin out, girls freakin out, motherfuckin cops tweakin out. Got you on your knees like a freak, jugglin deez nuts.

My telly's a Desert Eagle for all the fuckin shots I called. My niggaz gotta ball, never settle for less. Heavy metal, heavy on yo' chest like two breasts. Step into my office cause it's time for you to roll somethin. One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole somethin. [Pos]. Yo these style I kick should be called ?? rap. Drawin the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I want it. They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet. They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet (shhhhh). The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain. but the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name. So pass the mic so I can put in my share. I rip it from home to L.A.. with connectin flights to rip it elsewhere. [J-Ro]. Drinkin up Black & Tan in the back of a van. I learned as a young man - long trip, piss in a can. Gettin a house for two grand, now you got your own land. Let your mind expand, everyday have a plan. Ro-Gram is rare earth, swingin Black Tarzan. You got to live with the cards dealt in yo' hand. Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand. and go Uptown Saturday Night like Ichiban. [Dove]. I keep it dirty like under the bed (dirty). Dirty like Uncle Red; aiyyo, (??) (??). Dirty brown Likwit flow thicker than the Yoo-Hoo. Dirt you dishin out, chef tellin it all. Face down in the dirt, doin my dirty work. Expert, tryin to regulate my network. Head jerk, spice it with rice, stick with it. If they ask who cut the grits I'ma say E-Swift did it. Chorus w/ minor variations. [Tash]. And I've been known to get it on, past the break of the dawn. Tash'll punch you in your grill and leave ""Potholes in Yo' Lawn"". (C'mon!) You makin diss songs? Spit that rhyme my way. I can shut y'all niggaz down like the Y-2-K.

The situation is drastic. but see songs like these is why this album goin classic. [J-Ro]. This is for the DJ, bring it back one time. I drop bombs like when my moms told me to rhyme.

Yeah - we flat out classic, seperate the real from the plastic. and I gotta say no names. Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame. Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame. Brand name fresh out the box type hustle. Manpower success is mind over muscle. Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss. I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss. Nailed to the cross it's time to return. My only concern is makin sure that Hollywood burn,. Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggaz. is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down. [J-Ro]. Four bottle rap, twist the cap and kick back. De La, Xzibit and Tha Liks came to get that. And what you know about us droppin ya. and leavin you with half a face like the Phantom of the Opera?. Chorus w/ minor variations. [Chorus extended]. Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes).

napalm,"[Verse 1]. Yeah, you thought that this was over. Thought you got away with murder. Watch me murder my deserters. This is congress secret service. Got your epirdermis calling. From the toxins in the water. Use the oxygen to slaughter. This is big business, baby, blood money bringing benefits. Still suffer from the ideology of Willie Lynch. Now it's all making sense, lets breed ignorance. Cause ignorance is bliss, watch the bliss make us filthy rich, bitch. [Hook]. I'm okay now, bring the napalm. I'll fly over and blow you away. No more sunshine, no more playgrounds. I'll fly over and blow you away now. There's no glamour, no guts, no glory. When I fly over, and blow you away. Blow you away now. The fuck can you say now?. I'm loading my napalm. [Verse 2]. The last shall be first, got dammit planet here we go. Camouflage cowboy, saddle up; rodeo. HIV, Polio, positive identity. Ashes of evil because we can't believe the trinity. Homeland Security, false is superiority. Fuck your intentions and big plans for my community. I ain't afraid to die, fuck you gon' do with that?. I'm coming to find you and wipe you off the fucking map, brrat. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. I just wanted to live my life like the common man. Have a family, a picket fence with a couple friends. Maybe even walk the dog when the night is right. Such a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights. And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all. Watch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn. I come inside just in time to see our baby walking. And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often. I'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey. Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away. And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right. Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify. I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall. How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?. Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall. Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all. Average for an arsonist, tagging up the Apocalypse. The narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite. All you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments. The system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious. This is for the populous, population genocide. Patriotic duty look alive but never sympathize. Take 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise. When they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind. But hey, hey. [Hook]. [Outro]. Serial killer"
nobody sound like me,"Intro:. Interviewer:. If you saw you walking on a street and a. black man were comin' torward you. what would you be feeling?. Scared man:. Just one single black man? (yeah). I really don't fear that. You know but if it's a group I'm talking from age thirt. even thirteen even younger than. thirteen. Yes I will walk across the street.. Interviewer:. Well let me ask you this.... Hook:. ""I don't want niggas soundin' like me"" -Ghostface Killah on 'Shark Niggas. (Biters)'. ""I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?"" (x2). Xzibit:. Yo we gettiin' restless me and D.O.G.s. Never pretendin' rather we sendin' a very clear message. Either you with me or against me punk hit 'em up. Provide housin' for these shrimp from the shells we dump. I'm makin' 'em bounce other niggas fail to bump. Til we takin' advantage of inflicting irreversable damage. It's the long awaited anticipated Likwit MC. Bombin' first cause I feel it's better to give then receive. You better believe. Xzibit stays savage above the average. When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cabbage. But see all that irrelevant it's like tryin' to turn a whore celibate. I dance with the devil for the hell of it. Burning down your lavish lanndscape on digital tape. Cause everything you rhymin' about is actually fake. So make room for the legitamate nasty inconsiderate. Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit. Hook. Montageone:. Niggas we null and void I get swole like a keyloid. To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums. To shut down artists with beats the deep closure. Battlin' top rank for bank and exposure. So open up your door to me Cause if it's closed. I'm a brakin' in with some pantyhose. Over the mic. So you don't know who I sound like. Executing those who record and bite to sound tight. It's not permitted by the right. The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco. Remember me man? You thought I was a fan till I threw you in the back of a. van. Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate. I spit on the mic to get these MC's pussys wet. For those with plans to clone me thee original. It can't be done I'm digital (digital). Hook. Xzibit:. Yo who wanna come see the hard rock?. The non stop green block yo whole block recieve speed knot. You need not. Get brave my bullets never graze. They hit close to home seperating flesh from bone. So better get off on your own bitch. Rollin' chrome shit tryin't to own shit. I was molded, after the best that the streets had to offer. The author of my own destiny. So I suggest you stop stressin' me. I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out. Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs. Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier. I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder. And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape. Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake. So make room for the legitamate nasty inconsiderate. Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit. Hook. ""I don't want niggas soundin' like me. On no album""."

Caught with the product that them young niggaz sell. I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager. The situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!. I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters. Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor. She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet). Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin. Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly. You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be. Automatics get tragic when you let niggaz have it. Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage. Monday morning, 8:30 right back in court. Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support. Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me. Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, ""Not guilty!!!"". They used to have me on that paperwork. 'cause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt. See I was first on my block with .40 caliber glocks. Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock). 'Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught. Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots. Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats. When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot. Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk. Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark. It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you. to a five by nine for a very long time. Fuck droppin dimes, niggaz is droppin whole hundreds. So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it. If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will. So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields. Yeah!. Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much. Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck. It's just like a house 'cause I take a bath in it. Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it. Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah. Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive. Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive. Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy. I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row. This some gangster shit for my niggaz down on death row. Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go. And Exhibit B - burn the rubber on the West coast. Y'all know y'all miss that shit"

I'm breakin it down, my sounds, so crowds are like deaf. from the West. puttin whole counties to the test. it's all in perspective. Breaker one-nine copy. this is for the niggaz gettin caught up in the Paparazzi. Chorus. Verse Three. Niggaz smoke stress and cross dress. but I just play the back. others going through schemes and pipe dreams. for a contract. real tightly rolled, fuck 'em all how I feel. I made a cool half mil. before I had a record deal. there for you look and stare like it's magic. too much of anything can make you an addict. when devils be startin static, forgot the automatic. I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate, but wait. who dare to cross this path. yo, I do ya like math. cut with glass, make a blood bath. so on behalf of all niggaz I get drunk with. smoke a lot of blunts with. I dispose of your punk shit. keep it all in perspective. Carbon Copies gettin caught up in the Paparazzi. Chorus."

I remember when you set your own hood on fire. I reinforce the freeways, to bring the tanks. So the next time y'all trip, fuck bloods and crips. Cause we the biggest gang in L.A.. Ramp Part, fuck with us, get blown away. [Chorus:]. I'm the police, I'm the police. I'm the police, I'm the police"
recycled assassins,"Hook:. There's no escape from the ones who harassin'. The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'. Now I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'. But season after season they recycle assassins now. Montageone:. He's too advanced for his own good. He didn't get a second chance to see the glock pointed at his hood. Makin' his way through the rain he's caught in the game. He felt the pain of a slug to the back of the brain. Nothin's changed in a city flask. Where niggas lurk in black shirts pants and low hats, forever. Until the job is done and no one's left. My man Jeff told me with his very last breath. To watch moms. But they got her with the car bomb. Pop tried to save her second blast got his arm. Niggas play for keeps like casino. Baby's has got fathers just got back from doin' Chino. With nothin' to lose loose screws in the attic. The only skill a nigga knows is how to strip an automatic. And stash the barrel stab a nigga something terrible. Death resume 20 kill in incredible time. No guilt and shame. On the mind stuck a nigga for lookin' didn't know he was blind. So I find. Mankind is a serious threat. To another others kind when there's something to get. In a vet gonna fast jet to the spot to see what they got. Nobody saw shit cause it's not. Cool to brake the rule of the code of the streets. Niggas frightened by the visions of the blood on the sheets. And it's deep how blood drys as a mother crys. Open eyes gettin' landed on by flys. There's no disgues for the ones who harassin'. The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin' now. Hook. Xzibit:. I came from a family of one girl and three boys. Fuck playin' with toys our fun was on the block. Watchin' all the cats negotate the neighborhood stock. My job was to come runnin' whenever cops was comin'. My older brother I figure was the ring leader. Whenever these cats move they all bring heaters. All black and nickel plated (c'mon). Soon became fasinated bitches cars and kicks. And look at how fast they made it. My younger brother gave less than a fuck he was content. With G.I. Joe and Tonka trucks. But I want butts, livin' first class delux. 15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks. My older brother was touched. It's a game where you don't play gotta have cane. Crack house for my birthday. The next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police. In a rage he lived but he payed the price. Caught with keys 25 to life. Takin' in by the crew time to standed on my own two (c'mon nigga). But as I marinated thinkin' about the hood. I really can't remember my body doin' good. For long big decisions somebody got to make 'em. Undercover recognize the face now can't shake a. Phone tap (what) and now I'm in the belly of the beast. Use to sittin' in leather sheets now I'm sittin' awaitin' release. Visitors day, my younger brother came down. Put the toys down excited about the first round. He bust I was crushed to finally see. The solution to the problem could of started with me. It's on now. Hook."
release date,"Yeah, today the big day. (Xzibit). Been here four years, eleven months and twenty-nine hot ones. One more day and I'm a free man walkin. Leavin from behind these gates, I paid my debt to the state. And ever since they took the weights. Wasn't much for a nigga to do but start thinkin. Wishin I was back home drinkin every weekend. Remember like it's yesterday, eight-teen and ?. I can't remember the letters I just wrote a lot of them. Goin for a ride that I cannot stop. Set up shop in Cochran, connect the dots. And for those that don't know, thats the Pen-East to Fresno. Northeast to Baskersfield, fuck ""Let's Make a Deal"". Livin around niggaz who kill, right along with the niggaz who will. At the drop of a hat, sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that. Niggaz givin up the manhood they can't get back. It's a sick university, murder the cirriculum. Concrete campuses, I miss Los Angeles. More than that I'm missin my kids. Missin my turf, missin my bitch, what could be worse?. Shouldn't have asked that, called the bitch collect (It's Xzibit). Some nigga picked up, wanted to break her neck. When kites slide up under your door, you slide them back. Cause when you pick em up and read em that's where you're at. And if you ain't rollin with that then watch your back. Level four right away, gettin hit the same day. Playin the price for the games you play. Never realize how precious time is til you give it away. Can't remember what a t-bone taste like. I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life. Motherfuckers cryin, shanks gettin sharpened. Tacs gettin taced up, plottin and talkin. Sellin everything from weed to blow. When it's time for you to go you're the last to know. niggaz holdin weight, essays got the power. Locked down, one shower every seventy-two hours. ? tuna, trigger happy sharpshooters. Waitin for the jump off, can't wait to thump off. Had to smash a nigga readin my shit. Tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch. I seen niggaz sleep for weeks, get too weak. And then physically and mentally cannot compete. Find new shit to master, make the time move faster. Home sweet home, shipped off to Land Caster. Kept a low pro, close to home and I'm trippin. Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin. Everybody runnin they mouth, pussy to count. Cause bitches in Cali love niggaz thats freshed out. But some of these niggaz on swipe. Gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked. Fuck that, when I touch back I got plans. If I can't rock the powder, rock the fans. Give my naked pictures away, shake some hands. Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again. On all times take the long walk to the front gate. Dress out expandin shit, today my release date. (Talking). [X] Alright my niggaz, I'm gone, see you in an ounce dog, woo!. [G] What's up nigga. [X] Yeah, what's up nigga. [G] Hey get in the car, my nigga, sup X?. Here goes ya motherfuckin chain nigga. Lucky I didn't pawn that motherfucker. [X] Ha, yeah right. Check it out dog, everybody know that you just got out. That shit was all on the radio. But dig it I got two strippin bitches. just flew in from motherfuckin Las Vegas. ready to get down and dirty, I got a pound of weed, got on the Hennessy. Everybody at the club waitin, what you wanna do?. [X] Take me to the motherfuckin studio."
rework the angles,"* also featured on Sway and King Tech's ""This or That"". [A.G.]. Check it out now. I work the angles like, off the cushion in the sidepocket. Electrifying like a live socket. Hit em with all flavors, yup. We tryin to be neighbords with pro-ballplayers, I'm talkin papers. or keep it realer, and see me on a Iron Caterpillar. On point like a killer, plus ready, to deliver. type gifted, treat the mic right, or I might rip it. Critics dig my style cause I write different, no hype. I just kick it, low-lifes, they wanna get it. I shine like the ice when I hold mics, everytime. got every dime, sayin this nigga so nice, you know what?. They so right, you get stuck, I'll go twice. Lit it up when I blow mics. [Evidence]. Show mic precise, require sacrifice. That's no hassle, the master got more loops than lassos. Y'all hear me? They all conspiracy theories. Worthless, like testing Ev' defeats the purpose. Since the beginning, intrigued by pot and attentive women. Breakbeats and windmills on concrete. covered by cardboard, seafloor to skyline. Bottom line, in rhyme yo, put in time you shine. That's right sometimes I get so hyped. I feel like Diamond D the best producer on the mic. I aced this -- most punchlines are tasteless. Regular, average, mediocre, makeshift. To all my DJ's, with skills you got a lotta. This ain't on your mixtape, yo it coulda been hotta. The method in this game they'll have you drained and strangles. Don't go to them, let em come to you, and work the angles. [Defari]. Don't sleep on, I leave your knee torn, like Sehorn. Liquid MC storm, like children of the corn, a wild freeform. of energy, mentally fit to last a century. Like centuries, one double-zero translate to victories. You kiddin me me? Come wack that's not my history. Kidnap the wack and break his ankles, remember +Misery+?. Lyrically you're skatin out of control. Work the angles 'round the globe, from Newark to South Pole. It's so cold that MC's catch pneumonia. I'm airborne, from L.A. to Barcelona. I rock heads from Pomona out the Bronx. Drop the sure needle contact, now watch me launch. DJ's, you jugglin, that means I'm bubblin. Defari on the remix fix, this shit is thunderin. Picture me fumblin or droppin the ball. That's like picturin Guy without that nigga Aaron Hall. [Iriscience]. Well if a brother gets the best of me. Ain't no use in sniveling and blaming the referee. Fuck that, I strip the mic with tenacous D. Kick it up to Evidence, yo kick it out to me!. Line up the three, trifecta stroked properly. Rocca, I work the angles triple opticly. The hip-hop multi-beat real monopoly. My G is God, what's your G for, geometry?. This man of war beats cold on the seashore. An deeo enough to take it to the sea floor. Every single beat bangs like a C-4. We drop beats, why you asking what the beat for?. The Spitfire fighter Dilated entity. I'm learning shockers like Shockra building energy. While barbershops sipping Henny like the Kennedy's. I'm always been independent, that's word to Beni B. It's guaranteed. [Xzibit]. Make T-shirts and slingshots, I bust khakis out, bounce to the weed spot. Naturally, me and my faculty never play with this. I Used to Love H.E.R. too, but now I fucking hate the bitch. She's sucking up to all the niggas with the chains and whips. But that's alright, because all she do for me is pay the rent. And keep it moving, got a bad habit of losing my cool. Acting a fool, breaking out tools, and making the whole corwd move. Towards the exit, this be the next shit, we got you Dilated. Hotter than Satan, the repeated parole violations. Xzibit work the angles, cordless to dirty angels. How the West was Won: with microphones and turntables."
ride or die,"[Chorus]. We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the. sky. Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get. by. Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's. fly. My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by. It's either ride or die.... [Xzibit]. ... we just boogy, advance. The rubber band stack thick in my pants. Real gangsters make plots and plans and touch dirt. Only prayin for the day when they can wash they hands. Real gangsters leave nothin to chance at first glance. If it ain't a sho' thing then you bet' not swing. Real gangsters keep that Cutlass clean, keep the. monsters mean. And when you dump it drop it right at the scene. Real gangsters got a gangsta lean. You might not talk red, black, or blue but everybody. talk green. Glance to my left look over my right shoulder. Livin life in my rearview, FUCK stayin sober. Forget back I sit back and wait for the click-clack. Real gangsters want real spit so I spit that. Real gangsters don't even say it. They just hit the trunk cock it and spray it. Light up your Christmas! Yeah!. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. ... and don't slip up. It's way too late when the bodybags zip up. Real gangsters pray for they soul when they get up. You live by the gun but you'll die by that hit up. Watch that rig up, find yo'self in a box. in a spot where the cops can't dig up. Real gangsters ain't just thugs in bandanas. Slugs and big cannons, drugs and big hammers. Real gangsters open up ya minds and expand 'em. Why was Tupac really spittin at the cameras?. Cause real gangsters get no peace, they want us six. feet deep. or locked down in the belly of the beast. Real gangsters make bread, rise like yeast. Won't hesitate to put hot chrome to ya teeth. So fuck beef! Real gangsters load heat. When ya see 'em in the street better call the police,. c'mon. [Chorus]. [Tone]. ... syndrome is a fear. that inner-city residents have of they own peers. People in they own community. usin a case where two blacks got smoked by one in '93. And ain't now nigga be the murder case. Usin and servin survival shit as a defense plea. In Cali big knot (knot). The judicial system out here'll have you level fo'. 'til you rot. It's because of the system we violence stricken. Forced to frequent the zone when the reefer's driftin. And it's hella drift cause in Southeast Danglewood. Damn near, 30 years of Bloodin and Crippin. And we inflicted with a disease mo' trip than an. H-I-V. Can't nuthin protect you from a hundred, drummer. 2-2-3's. You can call the police. Wear a V-E-S-T but forget about safety. [Chorus]. . Zéhh"

He bought it, he rolled it. He passed it, you smoked it. Now ya fucked up off some weed mixed wit coke shit. Ya love her, ya hate her. Ya fucked her, ya raped her. Twenty-five to life cuz ya can't control ya anger. Its heavy, its deep. Its solid, its weak. Things people say about ya records in the streets (Check it). Be careful what ya wish for. Ya fuck around and get it. I did it got in it. Spit it and didnt waste a minute. So where my niggas at?. What part of the game is that?. I paid my dues now nobody tryin to pay me back. And if they did i would probably have as much as shaq. My life is the movie so listen to the soundtrack. This what its all about. You better stall me out. And feel the aim of the name you niggas callin out. [Chorus]. If you feelin how im feelin. And you ready and willin. to come to the table. I put it together who doin it better. Come bounce with me (Come on). You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!). Take em out!. If you movin how im movin. And you chosen and proven. So lose the illusion. The top guns cue the confusion. Come bounce with me (Come on!). You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!). Take em out!. I'm tired, I'm hungry. You're lazy, disgusting. You're lay around my house and ya never do nothing. I seen it, believed it. Planned it, conceived it. Missed me with the bullshit bitch I dont need it. I cheated, you cheated. We cheated, so beat it. Eat it like a dick bitch you too conceited. I broke it, replaced it. I slammed it, I chased it. Hands in the air if ya love gettin wasted baby!. You never seen us before. You betta come and get it. You with it im with it. I'm busy baby you fuckin with it. Is it your place or mind. Dont wanna waste your time. And you can get it how you want it it'll blow ya mind. Its over time. Takin pride in the bump and grind. A hit from behind to leave you with a broken spine. This what its all about. You better stall me out. Its just the game of the name you bitches callin out. [Chorus]. Pop it, drink it. Float it, sink it. Plan to stop me then you better rethink it. Drive it, use it. Pimp it, abuse it. Shit motherfuckers do to hip-hop music. I live it, I die it. I'm laughin, I'm cryin. Pop two of these bitch, lets start flying. I hear it, I taste it. I touched it, I faced it. Breakin down the bullshit back to the basics. I had to kick in the door. Thats how I had to get it. I shitted with lyrics. And getting better for fuckin credit. Gettin gangsta with it. The best that ever did it. Hit it and quit it my nigga. You shouldnt babysit it. We need more emcees and less wannabes. Three hundred and sixty degrees of reality. Thats what its all about. Kill em and haul em out. Now feel the aim of the name you haters callin out. [Chorus]."
rimz & tirez,"[Defari]. Take a chance, come dance with a cowboy. Playin stopped playin long time ago with childish toys. It's only men in here; deuce deuce inch Pirelli. and Goodyear niggaz, sip malt liquor beer. They gave me sixth man of the year, came off the bench for Tha Liks. Shot the lights out at the championship. Big chips, big trips, new fits, my money clip's. full of green cheese, my other pocket got green weed. Rap niggaz, we different individuals. Elevate the level of the music and the visuals. It's do or die, I need a +Priest+, call +Superfly+. Whatever we discuss when we meet's between you and I. I'm truly high, red-eyed for the red-eye flight. Five hours, eight drinks, I rode all night, shit. Everyday, every night's a saloon. Crime blitty, good bottle, million dollar tunes. [Chorus: Kokane]. Love when when you're out there on the ave. When you're down 24/7, niggaz don't know the half. My Romeo's step down on the pedal. my back keeps on scrapin the metal. I be coastin and be coastin, hittin three wheel motion. with my rimz and tirez. [Xzibit]. I ain't never seen Kevlar flesh (hell naw). Y'all bitch niggaz is flirtin and fuckin with death. I was taught to stick with the right and work with the left. Never love nothin, never turn snitch and confess. Got catch me in the heat of the act, and run the risk. of catchin three to the back, and try walkin with that (yeah!). I ain't goin to the pen for shit, except to snatch up. my loved ones to get loose and hop the fence. It ain't hard to look hard, snatch up a catalogue. Mad dog to niggaz that walk up your boulevard (yeah!). But one day, you gon' feel it (what?). I'm a firm believer in the theory if it bleeds, I can kill it. A hit man for hire (yeah!) caught up in the crossfire. The live wire, leak a nigga like a vampire. My empire roll rimz and tirez. Either get with us, forget us and get behind us, muh'fuckers. [Chorus]. [Interlude]. Ride along, with my rimz and tirez. Side along. [Goldie Loc]. Mr. Recycler (what?) I'm lookin for a sixty-two Chevy. and she kinda bad, threw him six and I was read'. (Whatchu want me to do?) To get spic and span. Man I'm glad you came and got me from that old white man (good lookin). He took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps. (bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt). And I change colors when the sun hit me. Fix me up, now my owner wanna slang me for 50?. Bling bling, now I belong to a Japanese. And they was quick to throw me in the magazines. I make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools trippin. (Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dippin?. (None) Afraid to get that ass caught slippin (why?). For me it was an easy task. I kept an engine on my ass with heat under the dash. Fool (peep game) I was born to lowride on rimz and tirez, yeah.

Straight West coast and West worldwide ROLLIN. Got that Aston Martin DV9 equipped with a stash box. In case I ever find myself alone in a tight spot. Strip down my frame, repave my lane. Insane with my ink pen, Citizen Kane. Don\'t complain when the chamber slide back and bang. Make it taste like shit when you sayin my name. It\'s the Golden State heavyweight, holdin the belt. Cause I\'m a one man army I don\'t need no help. This is a - PISTOL, I use to protect myself. Careful these hammerhead hollow points is bad for your health. My nia. [Chorus - 2X].

[Chorus: Don Blaze (Kurupt)]. See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain\'t my fault. My back was up against the wall... thanks to y\'all. (Niggaz talkin\' like bitches).

say my name,"(feat. Eminem, Nate Dogg). [Eminem]. This ain't beef man. I don't know what the fuck to call it. But no beef. Whattup X?. I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly. Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me. I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby. if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me. to do war, and try to bring my crew back down. I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now. I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out. With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now. [Xzibit]. Let's see who got they city on lock. Let's see who got the better aim with the glock. Let's see who come out on top. Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets. Let's see who wanna die the same time as me. and make ends meet. Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?. I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse. And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri. Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now. [Chorus: Nate Dogg]. I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name. Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain. Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same. Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain. Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game. Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain. I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain. Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name. [Xzibit]. Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin. Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me. How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me. There'd be no West coast without me. Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival. And now you tryin to act like my rival?. Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth. Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth. all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony). All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the. tragedy). Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now. I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile. Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand. They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man. So who the FUCK?! (Who the FUCK?!) you think you talkin to. Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him. Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him. I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him. I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him. purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels. I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you. But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you. I ""Square Dance"" cause I'm sick of rappin circles. around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out. It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow. You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out. You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon. (I) No gangsta you ain't either. (Will) But I know that I spit ""Ether"". (Not) I shoulda crossed your belly. (Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly. X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass. For the last time man.. [scratched] - ""Watch your fuckin. mouth"". [Chorus]. [Eminem]. For the last time man, I'm through"
scandalous bitches,"Scandalous Bitches. [Xzibit]. She was a brown skin ebony honey that love hip-hop. Cut off tank-top, she make your whole face drop. Hotbox, like it or not, she don\'t care what I got. She got her own knot dealin\' in stocks. And in the backwoods she plans to dust me off. Suck me off, and then say I must be off. Tryin\' to smoke with X, the Cali kush was makin\' her cough. She must hate wearin\' her clothes, she keeps takin \'em off. At the Palms Hotel on a friday night. Attack each other like animals \'til the sky turn bright. Make it a - night to remember, she went tellin\' her sista. Then her sista turned around and told the shit to Melissa. Then Melissa got my number, started sendin\' me pictures. in all type of different positions, man this bitch on a mission. Listen, a man is a man, gon\' handle his business. I ain\'t a bad guy, just dealin\' with scandalous bitches. I remember when Xzibit used to push in a Caddy. I met this chick from the Valley, she said she wanted me badly. Now this is common in Cali because the homies is savy. Bitches be givin\' money to niggaz and callin \'em Daddy. She in a brand-new Lexus, just moved from Texas. She came to California to model and be that next bitch. Takin\' naked pictures tryin\' to gain more acceptance. Maybe get some jobs, try to politic some connections. I said appreciate for X to the Z. My homie picked through my trash instead of talkin\' to me. He fell in love with her ass, and while she casin\' his place. Tryin\' to tell another nigga what he got up in his safe. About the big hundred stacks and them bricks to match. Forever watchin\' his back, therefore he never relax. And when her nigga attack, he got a slug in his britches. He ain\'t a bad guy, just dealin\' with scandalous bitches. I met this girl from the \'Natti, I got along with her daddy. I made it up in my mind this is the girl I\'ma marry. Now when you wanna get married the preparation is scary. You want your weight to get carried, you want your skeletons buried. She moved out to California next to me in a hurry. Her reputation was dirty, but yo that didn\'t disturb me. I want to stop the insanity, try to have me a family. Started checkin\' my phone and brought her back to reality. Left her ring on the dresser, adios motherfucker. I\'m travelin\' home from the road, I hear she fuckin\' with Usher. Now Usher don\'t even know me but I got love for the homie. Even though everybody around me be thinkin\' he corny. She denied everything, said the rumors was phony. On the phone cryin\', she love me, said she wanted to hold me. (\""Yo he ain\'t shit to me Alvin, I was just into his album. That was some bullshit, I\'m sorry, I\'m better without him\""). So I\'m off to Miami, got invited to party. by Mr. Raymond himself, yo I ain\'t hatin\' nobody. Now when we walk in the party, yep, guess who I see. Lyin\' bitch said she was callin\' from N.Y.C.. He started wipin\' the sweat off of her face and her chest. And then she gave him a peck, and then she looked to the left. And when she seen it was X, she started cryin\' and trippin\'. And dude was lookin\' confused, the scene it couldn\'t be written. Now he just pluckin\' his chickens, I ain\'t gon\' sock him or diss him. I\'m from the West Coast, where niggaz don\'t be fightin\' for bitches. A little over-dramatic, in Rome I called him a faggot. in front of millions of people, funny but shouldn\'t have done that. I was makin\' a joke, I didn\'t mean to offend. Like when I introduced Destiny\'s Child as Boyz II Men. Listen, a man is a man, gon\' handle his business. I ain\'t a bad guy, just dealin\' with scandalous bitches. \""X, you ever get tired of um, motherfuckers talkin\' to you about Pimp My Ride?\"""
scent of a woman,"Yeah...Check it out...They say behind every strong man. Is an even stronger woman. [Chorus]. Cause she, was put here to defeat me. Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me. Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need. Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me. Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me. Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need. [Xzibit]. Man, (?) with that sucka, she. I'm from a place, where they quick to say ""Fuck A Bitch"". And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try ta get a hitch. But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit. Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own da shit. You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick. So who am I? I reply with my government, exchange the numbers. Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger. Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line. Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time. Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman. I got 20/20 cord vision, seein' you comin'. Livin' my life, I don't need a wife. But you persist, tryin' ta strengthen our relationship. But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets. Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace. You ain't the one for me!. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit. Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit. Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets. Provide a place for all my peoples to eat. I'm feelin stuck, had to hustle up. The A-T-F, hit the house, had me shackled up. You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out. You never let a brother down, when you stressin out. You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route. You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out. And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat. You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me. I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was. The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man. I understand that you love me and you want the best. but if you wanna take the good, you gotta take the rest. I rock a vest, baby!. [Chorus]. Cause I, run these streets for my struggle. Cause I, carry heat for my troubles. Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?. Cause I, want family so I'm buildin. Cause I, want you just for my children. Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?. [Xzibit]. And all this time it was you. Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin you through. It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true. I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I must do. I used to think I was the MAN, wasn't havin a clue. I wasn't lookin for no love, but I found it in you. It's so true, behind every great man is a women. Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come runnin. You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life. I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight. I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down. You always given me another reason, I can smile. Cause you beleived in me, when there was nothin there to see. My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree. Ugh, nothin can stop us now, ?Verawane? gown. Watchin your father, walk his little lady down the isle. Cause you the one for me!. [Chorus]. Cause she, was put here to complete me. Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me. Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need. Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me. Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me. Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need. [Outro]. Dedicated to the real ones out there. Ugh, yeah, this is for you. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Zéhh"

Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax. who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true. But I grew up where niggaz jack you, harass you. Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?). Mash on you for your turkish chain, C.K. B.K.. Blued up or flame, I ran wit a gang. I helped niggaz get, jacked for they Dana Dane's. My pants hang below my waistline. I look humble wanna rumble?

spit shine,"I'ma clean this whole shit out like colonics. With words put together better than Sony Electronics. King of the jungle, humbly stay honest. Eat with the lions, swim with piranhas. Gasoline the seem, strike the match. Inferno, I'm too thoro nigga so stand back. I spit shine, get mine and rip rhyme. and make my career take an in climb. I'm strict with knives, straight with razors. Good with grenades and great with gauges. Been around the world in a million stages. Watch niggas bitch up and go through changes.

For evidence of the weapon and the people involved. Let one nigga talk, everybody gettin' caught fo' sho'. I say that to say this (what?). If you can't handle the time then ride the bench. Might as well touch ya tail and jump the fence. Castrate ya self, expose the bitch. X go head up, but fuck, never ran from it. I got a gauge with buck shot that you can't stomach. You ain't a killa, you a album filla. You ain't a soldier, you a rap promoter, game over!. CHORUS. I'm gon' be here after the smoke die down. The sound of your style, I won't lie down. Fight the good fight, don't need no help. Keep your hands up, defend yo self. Move like I move and live life long. Can't move up if ya heart not strong. Get ya own shit 'cause this shit's mine.

step up,"Daz:. Aw yeah!. Right about now it's time to get busy. Huh, straight out the box, nonstop. Kurupt the Kingpin, Xzibit, Crooked I. (Wait a minute, um). Crooked I:. This is the art of, manslaughter. When I'm rockin' I'm more shockin' than droppin' a boom box in bath water. You entered the wrong scuffle. You catchin' a chrome buckle. I uppercut niggas hard enough to break my own knuckles. Deliver the sick verbals. My shotty spit a round, before you hit the ground,. your body spin around, in six circles. Diminishin' infamous menaces. I'm waitin' to get dicced, if not, I'm a start finishin' innocents. Lyrics (lyrics), I'm breezin the region. Freezin g's in your legion. Freakin' ancient techniques when I'm speakin' phoenician. It's all about Crooked. These bitches shout Crooked. I'll make you say the West Coast aint shit without Crooked. I own a vicious label, niggas'll get disabled. When I'm spittin' rhymes written on project kitchen tables. I load this 4-5 and let slugs dive at ya. Now that's for Crooked I, the scrap happy, mic snatcha. Daz:. Motherfuccers can you dig that, huh?. Can you fucc with this?. Let's get Kurupt the Kingpin to fucc y'all niggas up. Y'all don't wanna see none of this west coast MC shit. Yeah, how you like me now motherfucker!?!. Kurupt:. Terror starts, in the midst of your heart, starts. The storm, my vocals float like arts. In the mystic state of mind, when I create a rhyme. My microphone massacres every year the same time. With audio amputations, vocal thoughts of a loud talker. Up against the microphone night stalker. With a tendency of bashing MCs, like ten of me. As you can see I continue mashin' MCs. Caboom, the room gets cleared as my views get clearer. Extra-terrestrial microphone terror. In effect, get infected. Tell me what the fucc you expected. These venemous injections. I leave whole sections, and sections full of injections. From these poisenous melodies and selections. I select the methods of slow anguish. I mangle shit with my language. Tell me, have you ever seen one elope. With the microphone. In a scandal like abilities to make MCs explode. Baboom, alone in my own zone. So don't compare me to none. Not one's nearly. Severe, cuz I severely, impare MCs. Near me, oppose and fear me, I got plots and theories. Sincerely, I could have the spot locked. Niggas get stoned for touching microphones. with no knowledge on how to rock. Daz:. Yeah, back in effect, it don't stop. Turn your speakers up, DJ Battlecat on the table. We fuckin' it up like this and like that, yeah. Got my homeboy Xzibit in the motherfuccin' house. Alkaholiks!. Xzibit:. When I was enlisted. I came to the table double fisted. Sadistic, heavy artillery, for all my enemies. Bust shots up in the sky screamin' obsenities. Make niggas sport cackies and chucks from hear to Italy. It'll be, a cold day in Hell when you see Xzibit fail. Act like a bitch on bail, tuck tail, and run. See we do it how it can't be done. I'm the rough cut, plus how the west was won. Or direct descendant of the gatling gun. Don't test me son, you fucc around and catch you one. That aint a threat, that's a promise I can definitely keep. You can't compete wit' 25 niggas wit' heat in the street. Ready to repeat, round after after round at you. All hell break lose when the whole Pound come through. I found that you and yours, can never fucc wit' mine. I own shit but gimme some more like Busta Rhymes. Cross the line, now you gotta pay the piper. I'm The Alkaholik sniper, that be keepin' the crowds hyper. It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust. Can't stop till me and my niggas is platinum plus. My Dogg Kurupt. Daz:. Yeah, no shit.

symphony in x major,"(feat. Dr. Dre). [Xzibit]. Time to snap out of it, welcome to the real world. My life like a Hitchcock flick, stick to the script. If she can't stick to the script, stick to this dick. How she actin off of the fifth? Ridiculous shit. We don't need conversation, just crowd participation. If you here on vacation we got, rules and regulations. Seperate myself from y'all, segregation. Tryin to stop Xzibit and Dre? Humiliation. Pure elevation, got me some inspiration. Two bitches in bubble baths, a beautiful invitation. Got a live occupation, live for the moment. I'm faced with an altercation manhandlin my opponents. I got eyes in the back of my head. I never sleep so they bloodshot red. Yo we so far ahead of our time. If we can stop life and press rewind. You still wouldn't catch up 'til 2K and a dime, so turn it up. [Chorus - female and male singers]. [F] Turn it up!. [M] Turn it up. [F] This is it!. [M] This is it. [F] We the shit. [M] We the shiiiiiiiiiit. [F] Get with it!. [F] Give a fuck. [M] Give a fuck. [F] Who you wit. [M] Who you wit. [F] Turn it up!. [M] Turn it uppppppppppp. [F] Get with it!. [Dr. Dre]. Truthfully speakin, it's lonely up here all by myself. So I had to come down and pass around some help. From N.W.A to whatever's next. Make sure it says ANDRE YOUNG in bold letters on big checks. Your shit ain't sellin? Fuck it, get Dr. Dre on it. You got a budget? I'll get down, give me half of it. One session, one song, I'm gone. The first week, you hit the streets, a star is born. to add to my universe - let me show you. who can invade who nigga, and who can do who the worst. Warning from the Surgeon General. Watch out for fake hits and bullshit that sounds identical. Pick it up, read the credits, who you thought it was?. Twenty years in the game, with a constant buzz. Pick a year, any year, see how hot I was. Same shit today, and still don't give a fuck!. [Chorus]. [Chorus 2]. [M] Stay.. in your place. [X] Stay in your place nigga. [M] You can't face, what we bringin. [X] What we bring to the game, playa. [M] Bounce like this. [X] Bounce. [F] Bounce like this. [M] Blaze your shit. [F] Blaze your shit. [M] And get high for meeeeeeee. [Xzibit]. Let me give y'all niggaz somethin to hold. This product not to be sold. Know you can't cook it over a stove. You can flip it and come back with a mitt. Don't make me reach through your limo tint. I just want my twenty percent. This is dedicated to the people that spoke too soon. I think I'll stop shootin you niggaz and shoot for the moon. Motherfuckers turn respect on and off like a light switch. I'll never be seen, like Farrakhan fuckin a white bitch. Jump I won't flinch, dump I don't miss. X holdin this, I'm never losin faith or focus. So say what you gotta say, every day a holiday. We don't blow the roof, we blow the whole fuckin spot away [BOOM]. Organize permission like, organized crime. Organized minds, organize they nickels and dimes. Organized vocab be organizing my rhymes. Organizing my business and organizing my time, so turn it up. [Chorus]."
thank you,"Thank You. [Xzibit] Yo, listen, huh. [Chorus: Xzibit]. I just wanna thank you, for bein around. And patiently waitin and holdin me down. It\'s easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z. That without no you, there could be no me. I just wanna thank you, for bein a fan. And watchin me grow from a boy to a man. It\'s easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z. That without no you, there could be no me. [Xzibit]. You \'bout to hear some words, that you ain\'t probably heard. With all of these rappers pullin triggers and flippin birds. I know it sound absurd, cause they don\'t tell the truth. They prostitutes, fuckin contaminate the youth. But yet I\'m guilty of, the things I said above. No matter my faults still continue to show me love. Naw I ain\'t perfect mayne, but yet I stay the same. I play chess not checkers but this is not a game. And this is not a song, and this is not a verse. It\'s not conceived, or simulated or been rehearsed. Spent the first half of my life, thinkin that I was cursed. Could have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse. That wasn\'t meant for me, I spent a decade. makin it what it\'s \'sposed to be, hopefully brought you close to me. All these people approachin me, don\'t even know the half. I could be facin life but X is signin autographs, damn. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. My son\'s 11 now, I got to see him grow. Makin his free throws, the way he laughin at the show. Yo he remind me of me, when I was ridin bikes. He gon\' be taller than me, he got my mother\'s height. But yo you know the difference, between me and them others. They say you buggin when I call you my sisters and brothers. I coulda missed it all, I coulda dropped the ball. Mind of Metallica, motherfuck \'em and \""Kill \'Em All\"". I used to hustle raw, I used to run the streets. I used to hustle heats, I grinded all my beef. Most of my homies is gone, restin in peace. Some\'ll never see release from custody of police, but me. But nah my little dude get to go to private school. And I can do the things my father couldn\'t afford to do. That\'s what it\'s \'sposed to do, this is from me to you. Support from you and yours, thank you for gettin me through, true. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. We buried Proof today, it really broke me up. to see my brother in that casket, maaan what the fuck?. Media made me angry, I had to soak it up. The future is fragile never promised to none of us. Hittin so close to home, but what I focused on. is how he lived, the lives he touched, the cornerstone. We never walk alone, although sometime it seems. that nightmares go hand in hand with livin out dreams. So let me take this time, from my struggle my grind. to let you know that I appreciate you by my side. It\'s been a long ride, a lot of long nights. A lot of long flights, worth every sacrifice. A soldier of fortune fearless fightin the good fight. I never had a plan B, I never lost sight. That\'s why I hit the stage, that\'s why I kill the mic. It\'s for my fans that\'s ridin with Xzibit for life, RIGHT!. [Chorus]. [Outro]. Thank you, for lettin me breathe. For lettin me be who I am, huh, yeah, huh. Two little words, y\'all never get to hear enough. Knahmsayin? Yeah that, hehe... Yes.. the return. Uh-huh.. breathe!"
the anthem,"-RZA intro from ""Airwaves""-. [King Tech]. One two, one two. We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all. Brought to you by the WOOORRRLLD FAMOUS Wake Up Show. [RZA]. Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled. Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass. Sacred sword play tongue twist piercin holes in you. You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through yo' box. Walk wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block. One stopped, parks, pops his trunk. Snare pops loud as glock shots. Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation. We pause for radio station identification. WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP! (Tech is on). [Tech N9NE]. When I Woke Up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up. Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned. Styles were mixed like the Drummonds. Killer clown is comin lookin around your town is crumblin. This Big Tech from the Midwest, leavin MC's litless. On the Wake Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow. Put me off in a cypher? Potna, you can't *fuck* wit the snyper. Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper. Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo. Hypno, chryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter. Sway & Tech heard me flow and it's sealed. Now I got Swedish women yellin ""Tech N9NE svelte!"". [Eminem]. This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white out. Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?). Climbed out of a nice house. Through the front window and heard this guy shout. ""Hey that's my couch! (bitch!)"". Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout. While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds. And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin verticle. nose-first wit the top off landin up-side down. You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape. I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved. And Sway & Tech, two disk jockeys. Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject. [Xzibit]. Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold. Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul. Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll. Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold. Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up. Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake Up. The X-Man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room. Big game huntin from high noon till the full moon. [Pharoahe Monch]. Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush. From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims. As horrid as Boris Korloff was. When I cut ya neck, leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off. Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast. He asked, why did he have to die like cast metal?. O, huh, C now like Omar Credle. We pone pedal at a high resolution. On the Wake Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution. *DJ Revolution scratches*. [Kool G Rap]. I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway. Step away, wet and spray, rep the day. Who over debt to pay get swept away. Across the whole board like checker play. When I blaze your whole sect' arrays. Wake Up Show for those who slept away. Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray. DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the head decay. Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit blood redecorate. Until the head of jake investigate. [Jayo Felony]. What, Sway can give it to but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it. Tech can give it to you but Whatcha Gon' Do?. Rev can give it to you but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it. I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!. [Chino XL]. Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round. Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown. Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk. Which flow will I destroy you wit this time, the most commonest thought. The drama that's brought, caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry. For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive wit me. Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall. My style foul/file, for sexual harrassment like Tisha Campbell. You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy. I fuckin murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey. Now who the master to beg, your demo get passed on the reg'. You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg. I'm Wake Up Show reppin, wit Sway & Tech. My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon. I'm Chino X, bring KRS in. [KRS-One]. De de de da de de de da di day HEY! KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway. Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set. As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat. Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt. You gotta be, willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet. But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway and a Tech. They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect. Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway and Tech do. I'll be back but for now just SACKLE!!!. Ha ha ha, FRESH for 1999 you SUCKAS!!!."

Huh, Stay in my lane like a hustla. Never hate a motherfucker,tolerate a motherfucker. To a certain extent. When it's on, it's over. Don't get no chance to get popping. Forgotten about you before your body cold in a coffin. Just another failed attempt, you fall through the cracks. Sure as God made man, the first man was Black. The Black man made pyramids and gangsta rap. That's all I know, cuz poppa didn't raise no rats. Face the facts not the fiction. I Build my empire from a pocket full of stones. And a fifth of ambition. Niggas wanna ball but they never wanna listen. so instead of coming up, they just, come up missin. My mission is to hit with precision, shake whole continents. Crush niggas' confidence, expose my dominance. Without no conflict, you'll never have progress. I'm sending this one out to all the neighborhoods and projects, I'm a. [Chorus - A.H. singing (Xzibit)]. One shot gambler (Yeah) Two shot gambler (Come on). Three-time felon with that itch for dough. These madd street (Whuttup) Got me puffin on dro'.

These madd street (Uh) Got me puffin on dro' (Uh). I'm guilty .. For tryna make a living. [Xzibit]. Bitch I ain't tryna holler at you (nah). I'm just wanna drink, smoke, fuck and toss a couple dollars at you. I'm fightin dirty, I'll take thirty of you motherfuckers. I'm throwing cheapshots, low-blows and suckerpunches. I'm not for the games, I'm not in the mood. Not to be confused with dudes that fumble and lose. Xzibit move when I hear oppurtunity knockin. But I'ma shoot straight through the door if you comin with problems. It's too crowded at the bottom, too lonely at the top. Ain't no inbetween, trust me, like it or not. We gon' be here forever like cops and roaches. Do not approach us, ferocious, we pop them toasters, nigga. [Interlude - A.H. (X)]. I'ma have to hit the block, then around to my hoes. I got a haze, two trays, and a change of clothes, cuz. Pimpin' ain't easy y'all,it's too sleazy. Too greasy, and I can't take it easy!. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Everytime I try to get out. I get dragged right the fuck back in, it's like I'm never gon' win. Nigga got the whole world on his back. Overeact, matter fact we act like when animals attack. I know, pussy sells faster than crack, ambassador rap. Twist back your salary cap, who fuckin with that?. Welcome to the X games, enjoy my pain. Inhale my smoke, it's hard not to cough or choke. Motorola nigga up the old fashion way. This ain't rap, this is shit that I was born to say. Though lately I been having dillemas, with insignificant niggas. And half-ass rappers that think they can get it. We the Golden State, we keep the whole thing bouncing. Y'all move units, we move mountains. Y'all rap for bullshit, tryna be on T.V.. We seen you, now we don't like Chandra Levy, I'ma. [Chorus]."
the game don't wait (remix),"[G Child] (Xzibit). That's some good dope. Ain't nuttin' like some good dope. Yeah, umm hmm. That's some good shit, man. Woooo, Spaceketeers. Hey, This is the G-Child.

Roll some doe and nigga gimme somethin' to smoke. Say she didn't love the status, she just love the stroke. Restless, beat the pussy æ†ˆil she fallin' asleep. Athletes trippin' off a couple a thousand a week. Just to do the same thang. I didn't even know this bitch's name. She was in my car givin' me brain. [Warren G]. X to the Z pass the M-I-C. Anticipation 213 (Ah). We contimplate (Ah ha). And regulate (What). Now we got the game tight. It's money ta make (Money, money). The game won't wait but you can wait for the game.

It's true, that the dirt i did as a kid got me _Caught Up_. But I was brought up with the M-O if a D-O. So for your info, nigga. I been doin' this before I hit the radizzo. Snoop D-eezy is off the heezey. So you can make mine, extra cheesy. The crew's a twist cuz it consists of. Three riders, Eastsidaz, one love. Repeat 1."
the music of business,"(Xzibit): Yea. That's what I'm talking about. (Ras K.): Yea. (Xzibit): The homie John John up in this motherfucker. (Ras K.): Yea. (Xzibit): Mr. X to the Z with a public service announcement. for all you faggot ass rappers. (Ras K.): What's that?. (Xzibit): They think just because a nigga's rapping. with a label behind him, it's all great. (Ras K.): Yep. (Xzibit): It's modern day pimps and hoes going on. Ask EPMD, rap is still out of control. Cause hip-hop plus glocks = Scott La Rock, Tupac and Biggie Smalls. I figure y'all niggaz brawl for lack of protocol. Now I'm gonna take matters into my own hands, like masturbation. Another 39 suicidal rap is at heavens gate waiting to battle with Satan. Rassassination: taking heads like decapitation (ching!). Trapped in infatuation (really)? Back up off me. Kiss my ass. Then wake up n' smell the coffee. See, when you're broke and unknown, your baby's mama clown you. Your family down's you. Don't want your own kid around you. You ain't shit. Don't do shit. Ain't gone never be shit. So its quits. Two video's later, she's on your dick (Bitch). When your albums selling, she ""Don't Worry, Be Happy."". Bragging to her friends: ""That's just my babies daddy!"". And sadly, niggaz start acting like they shit don't stink. But wait: you getting cut like the wedding cake. The music business is straight Mafioso:. Jewish, Italiano, and Black. My BMI/ASCAP platinum placque rap track. Bootleg my shit to japan. At Swap Meets, sell my same shit back. Long sharks break legs. We break beats state to state. And record deals? That shit belong with a fucked up interest rate. (Chorus 2x):. (Parish Smith sample): Music Please, music please. (Color Me Bad Sample): ""Why you treat me so bad?"". (Parish Smith sample): Music please..music please. (Other sample): ""I don't know why baby!"". (Xzibit): Just handle your business. (Verse 2). It's sort of like the label is the devil:. R&B, Pop, Gospel to Heavy Metal. They make doe pimping the ghet-to. Label mates: different rats in the same rat race. The production company is the nigga that you learn to hate. Management is your crimy. Your lawyer is your liar. And when your famous but po', you set your accountants office on fire. It's like this: they loan you $1. For you just to break even, they stack $10. When you finally make one dollar, your profit is Andrew Jack-son ($20). You skinny. They got plenty. The Benjamins? Before you see any. They getting G's: big cheese.. No Vaseline fucking dope M.C.'s, ""so freeze"". Call the police chief? It takes a thief. Here's everything you need to know about the record industry,. like a chief.. 'Cause labels is doing $300,000 deals;. Blowing coke smoke up my ass, but we both know crack kills.. Not very many, rappers ever see a penny. But double platinum is two million units. CD's cost $20.. (Too true) So here's a clue. Somebody just make $40,000,000 and it sho' wasn't you. (Chorus 2x):. (Parish Smith sample): Music Please, music please. (Color Me Bad Sample): ""Why you treat me so bad?"". (Parish Smith sample): Music please..music please.. (Other sample): ""I don't know why baby!"". (Xzibit): Just handle your business.. Want to know the relationship between hip-hop and drugs?. 'Cause professional athletes, black actors, rappers, and thugs. all sleep in the same bed together. Rich black niggaz only kick it with other black people with cheddar. Same lifestyle: legal or illegal. It be us, swinging a three fuck getting skeed up with peanuts. Which leads up to this: a high turnover ration. Groupies turn tricks and be quick to give fellatio.. MC's get the pussy and fame.. Brothers essex floss with a corporate card. and charge it to the rappers name. But the label owners make all the real money. Just ask David Geffrey, Barry Gordy, Russel, or Puffy (ching, ching!). Business? You don't get what you deserve. You negotiate. And everything is renegotiable based on the sales you generate. But hip-hop fans don't buy albums, and, then again, tend to player hate. The rapper that went Pop. But before this, I never knew. Skills don't pay the mother fucking bills. Money do. Is you stupid? How nice I represent don't pay rent. The R&B ho who jock Theo on the radio buy your CD doe.. Rap magazines be screaming they keep it real. but keep it fake on the cover. Pulling tennis shoe and clothing advertisements. No wonder. Like Common ""I Used to Love H.E.R."". Now I just fuck H.E.R. with two rubbers. (Chorus: repeats until end):. (Parish Smith sample): Music Please, music please. (Color Me Bad Sample): ""Why you treat me so bad?"". (Parish Smith sample): Music please..music please. (Other sample): ""I don't know why baby!"". (Xzibit): Just handle your business."

So stay tuned my platoon finna touch down soon. Cancun to St. Thomas, St. Thomas to the Bahamas. Most niggaz ain\'t really honest so I\'m watchin my step. I\'m the hardest cold-hearted artist, the coast is clear. Dubai, Australia to Africa, this is the year!. Let the alcohol you sippin saturate in yo\' system. I be swimmin through these women, man, fuck \'em and flip \'em. I know you hopin I would fall to the side, or go to Way Side. It ain\'t a motherfucker alive to come and take mine (no!). Don\'t procrastinate, don\'t waste time. Never faced time, Houdini with crime, traffic over state lines. Military minded, stickin to the base lines. Intellectually brighter than California sunshine.

All that get money take money sound funny. So I stick to my own I can feel it in my bones. These clones and clowns ain't really down. Play the background westbound. Huntin' down pussy like a bloodhound. Plus I feel that no style is darker than mine. You can stick that into places where the sun don't shine. All you one hit wonders only in it for the spotlight. Spend half a million dollars still don't sound tight. Bring truth to the light. I write rhymes for the under. Blunt smokin' bottle crackin' all day slumber. Who wouldn't give a fuck if the world fell down. As long as I can twist a fat one and pass it around. Mr. X to the Z from the Likwit Crew. LA to Elviaire with my man EQ.

They like ""ooh. Don't say that."". When it's lay doe A dat Competition where they at?. I diss 'em. Steady at the rhythm. Like a pilot I keep you silent. Through the turbulence words will get violent. Mega doses exposes is flagellant composes. All you get is roses on your grave you misbehave. It's the brave courageous lyrically contagious. Spiritually engage with the psychedelic waves of. An Egyptian. We rips then. Cover the mic like the sun we eclipsin'. Cause no light shine through a flow like mine. Casual might ignite the mic for pastime. With one style older than the sundial. My elaborate connection of words is fun how. I display, dismay this way gettin' bissy. Crackers show off the top while I'm hittin' a J. My immaculate style attackin' with nouns and verbs. for the wack it gets foul. Got a Full Metal Jacket off rhymes to press.

Save mine up, cause nothin ever last forever. Never nothin out of my reach, we blast whoever. I can split a muh'fucker from his ass to his last thought. Shit talk, then stomp through the asphault. It's yo' fault we tow-truck for your outline. In due time, you'll find, the world is mine. So I listen to the rhetorhic, jealousy and the ignorance. Can't stop me nigga, my mind too militant. God blessed me with a chin. And a heavy right-left combination that'll cave your face in. So don't make me hurt you, patience is virtue. They only got a few of us let, huh. [Chorus]. [Xzibit]. Primo.. turn me up... Now it's two-thousand-and-two; where kids do. whatever the fuck they wanna do, huh, sad but true. Wanna take another life like it's the thing to do.

what's the difference,"[Phish] What's the difference between me and you? (repeat 2X). [Dr. Dre]. Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo. I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals. Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes. the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you. But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you. I still remember the window of the car that you went through. That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through. And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you. Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you. Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you. You see the truth is. Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is. And who I'm still cool wit. Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with. Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they *voice sample*. Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions. Move units, then talk shit and we can do this. Until then - I ain't even speakin your name. Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same. Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors. It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em. That's the difference. Chorus: Phish (repeat 2X). What's the difference between me and you?. You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do. I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions. I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin. [Xzibit]. Yo I stay wit it. While you try to perpetrate, play wit it. Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (YEAH). I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted. I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick. (Yeah!) Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions. I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings. So what the fuck am I supposed to do?. I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!). A heartless bastard, high and plastered. My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never come down. Pass it around if you can't handle it. Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates. What's the difference between me and you? (What?). About five back accounts, three ounces and two vehicles. Until my death, I'm Bangladesh. I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left. Yo that's the difference. Chorus. [Eminem]. Aight, hold up hold up!. STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say. Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me. (The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg. I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit. [Dre] Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it. But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch. [Em] I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?. [Dre] Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is. [Eminem]. Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer. But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma. I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her. And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California. And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner. at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her. Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off. Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of. Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up. Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up. and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water. That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product. That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!. You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!. So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis. Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!. Chorus 1.25X."

Take me to the edge like poppin pills. Straight up, no chase, hold up unless I'm bein followed. Never swallow anything unless it's from a bottle. And that's the whole truth, and nothin but the truth so help me God. By the powers invested upon my 5 Footaz squad. You ain't ready, oh cuz you dress like psychadelli. You the GMC like Chevy, I put a levy on yo cash flow. Just a little something to let yo ass know. Who to give 2 kind to when you pass go. Chorus [Xzibit]. You dealin wit alumni criteria. The one's that throwin Wild Pitches in ya area. Strikin you out, sending you back to the dugout. We goin up to your microphones pullin the plug out. Superior, alumni criteria, we the MCs that you make you feel inferior. Throwin Wild Pitches, fuckin your riches and your bitches. Rasassination, Jah Skillz, and Xzibit. [Ras Kass]. I ejaculate on blind justice wit the jury's se quested. And escape, run in a nigga's face like Hannibal Lector. The aqua-mati, my pen is penitentiary. Potenially plain paid for protocall pacific pro perfect cap pealer. Performing skull circumsitions, when I position the prism. Permiscuis wit other people's pussy ?pawn? wit the playa like Big Pun. Poisonous poet, I Master ""p"" like UHHHHHHH!!!. Skillz ?cotted? enabled. Herb you just and ingrown hair in the world of tweezers. We can dance before I crack MC's like Gator in jungle fever. Got them speakin in number like SoundScan. Severed the ears off your soundman, black Israelite. Like four-hundred and forty-four thousand. Niggas talk like dog, we'll walk like cat. I'm Ozzy Osbourne bitin the head off of rats. When they started bustin, fuck the Russian. We playin West Indian Roulette, ?some of mine? blind get wet. >From New Jack to Vet I can modem. Comes off like three adam's apples in the inner scrotum. My rhyme ?, clearin my sinus, bitch slime on your Iceberg. And let the virus cross appliance. Chorus. [Xzibit]. Give birth to earth to planet, we harder than granite. And concrete, man made could never compete, complete down to the core. Weighing in tons, hotter than lava, God, Javi, Jahovah, Allah heavenly Father. Nuns to bank robbers, wealth beyond the dollar. Here to school the scholar, make new born babies. No live for no bitch or lady, they try to play me. We flowin like the Mississsippi to the River Euphrates. One-hundred and eighty times two, one complete rotation. Fit any situation for a small donation, live on location. Third planet from the sun. Travel 24 hours you spend a lifetime to run. Witness the slave shot he bolted to a gat and a gun. >From Hitler, Musolini, to Attila the Hun. Imagine existence wit no fear, tears never shed here. One day for me could last a thousand years. The first element baby, one two..... Chorus."
x,"Yeah, ladies and gentleman. Broadcasted live to you and yours. It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit. Yeah, bounce it. Come on. The first day of the rest of my life. X stand behind the mic like Walter Croncite. Yo, keep the spotlight. I'm keeping my buns tight. Lose sight of what you believe. And call it a night. This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit. That you're used to. Teflon territory you just can't shoot through. You going shoot who? (Who?). Not even on your best day. Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up. Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck. Laid in the cut now we break through in the rut. Hennesy and Orange Juice baby fill up a cup. Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze. Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the. festivities. Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities. Bitches be quick to give me brains while I post the. range. Going up and down my dick like the stock exchange. 1 - (X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound. (X) Won't even say your own name when I come around. (X) Stay on top but remain from the underground. (X) to the Z and we all in the family. (2x). Ever since Xzibit could speak, been on some pimp shit. Approach every woman like a potential mistress. Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight. Cause tonight I might meet my next X wife. Mr. Big Chief Reefa, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa. I run it through and money come out. Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your. house. Ravel your spouse and have a little fun on the couch. Now you know that it was bound to happen. I came to give you what you lackin'. Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin. Rockin' chains, stadium, paladiums, cracked craniums. My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium. Drop tops sittin' on twenties. Using rappers like crash test dummies. Stackin' real estate and money. It's funny how things change overnight. When you thinking right. I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife. Repeat 1. Want an event?. We're hardcore 100%. Making this dick Los Angeles proudly present. The real deal, how does it feel?. No special effects. Yank the chain off of your neck. Demand the respect. Now all your conversations sound strange to me. Seems like everybody around me done changed but me. I stand alone on my own two feet. Stab a track, strangle the beat. Restless no time for sleep. Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm. It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend. Straight to the chair. (Not these niggas again). Come back, bounce in the spot and slide right in. I ain't trying to see nothing but progress,. regardless. Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious. Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle. Hennesy, rock plenty of ice, making a double, now. SCREAM. Repeat 1. [Snoop Dogg]. So there you have it. A-B-C D-P-G-C. X to the motherfuckin' Z. Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant. Xtrodinary, Xciting, X-alotta. X 'em with a little bit of Xtasy. X-ing a bitch out if you tryna test a g. And what's the recipe?. Xcalibur weaponary. And we shoot Xceptionally. That day is hot. X marks the spot?. Fuck naw, X spots the marks. Xclamation point, niggaz....."
xplosive,"Six-two). Xplosive, West Coast shit. My nigguh-ish ways attract, girls that used to turn they back. Causin me to yank they arm and pose like I would do them harm.

Eat a bowl of these bitch, gobble the dick. Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up!. Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash. Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded. Just pop ya collar, pimp convention hoes for a dollar. Six-Duece in a plush, six-duece Impala. Pimpin hoes from Texas to Guatemala. Bitch niggaz paid for hoes, just to lay wit hoes. Relax one night, and paid to stay wit hoes. Captain Save'Em all day (bitch) well save this dick. Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch. You ain't into hittin pussy, or hittin the switch. You into hittin bitches off of the grip you punk bitch. (Nate Dogg). All my real Doggs still kick it wit me. All my down hoes still trickin wit me.

Pimpin bitches on the regular, I put that on a G. A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be. Lemme drop some shit about this bitch I used to know. She gave ya boy the head and said don't let nobody know.. A bonafide pro, I had to grab the hoe. She got freaky in yo sixty-fo, I skeeted in her throat. Been knowin the hoe for fo days, pimpery pays. And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways. She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mo. They be beepin me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo. Them hot hoes is fiendin, they on the nuts. But bitch, I'm out ya pussy when I nut, for real. Xplosive..."
xzibit and tash freestyle,"""I ain't havin that, I ain't havin that. I ain't havin that, I ain't havin that"" [Redman]. [Xzibit]. >From now till forever it's the Likwit MC. X to the Z, you get Banned From TV. Fuckin wit me, Likwit niggas L-A-C. Captivate, visually stimulate the whole country (what you see?). In God we trust, but don't trust us. I'm ready to bust some lead in disgust. My homie Tony Touch said ""Relax, roll a dutch"". I'm on the grind like a clutch, bust ya, they never had this much. That'll take it to the streets, play the game never forfeit. This same time next year, we goin corporate. You can't force what don't fit. Your style is like a pistol wit no kick, you're weak and you don't hit. Bitches catch nuttin but dick, fuck the BS. Beat it to death, call Triple Seis, Triz from TS. Yeah, Hennesey For Everbody in my empire. Enemies get Kennedy-ed in my line of fire. [Tash]. Tash swings like Mark McGwire, X swings like Sammy Sosa. These guns up in my hoslter got me on the wanted poster. Runnin from the law, tryin to stay low-key. Old E and D&D lace the 50 MC. Then it's back to LAX, rough beats and concepts. They know they can't smoke me so they send me bomb threats. I'm rough like sex wit my ex. Tash beat the pussy up for old times sake, and then he just. Dash to cassettes, I hold the vinyl title. Xzibit holds it down wit the rifle. I'm runnin wit the trifle, LA tell these thugs. That New York City don't need no Bloods (why?). Cuz next comes the Crips, that's when the city flips. Niggas dyin over colors when it's all about the chips. So read it off the lips of the Alki bum-rusher. I'll fuck you up so bad Tony wouldn't wanna Touch ya."
xzibit freestyle,"You are now tuned in to the Golden state. To all my niguhs on the streets and behind closed gates. Continue to maintain daily and carry the weight. And all my folks on the outside continue to rise. Finally released to the rest of the nation, anticipation. Was killin' me, my niguh Flex said niguhs is feelin' me. Larger than life baby with crazy respect. You know these Alkaholik niguhs guaranteed to get you wet. Don't sweat the technique cause I was put on the street. To delete the weak minded, if you've got beef then grind it. Most niggaz is blinded by the glamour and glitz. But I don't fuck with that shit. Your only dope was your last hit. Constantly lit up from the place where we hit 'em. In the wrong hair dresser have you leavin' in an ambulance stretcher. Xzibit heard a thousand strikes. I give a fuck about five mics, and kerosine lights. All I need is my royalty checks my ice cold Becks. So bitch you dig ruff sex with Funkmaster Flex. Bringin' it live from my tape deck from N.Y.C.. To the We.S.T. switch the X to the Z. You are now tuned in to the Golden state. To all my niggaz on the streets and behind closed gates. Continue to maintain daily and carry the wieght. And all my folks on the outside continue to rise."

North Hollywood beef. grinding my teeth. have you stuck and stunned in disbelief. new breed Im the bad seed. smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes. bleed. dedicated to the niggas that despise us. so ain't nobody s'posed to be here. besides us. catch a flatline.

[Chorus 2x]."
you better believe it,"[Xzibit]. Yeah, yeah!. Yeah, we keep it bouncin like this. Yeah, huh, we keep it movin like. Listen, listen, look... The most wanted man in America, I +Soul Assassinate+ your character. Quickly embarass ya as easy as fuck!. Pressin my buttons nigga is just like pressin your luck. China-white, a hundred percent, pure uncut. Detonate, Little Kuwait, I'm blowin shit up. Go ahead, make your mistake, and throw that punch. I'ma pull this forty-four Mag and make you strip. then walk down the street naked, some gangsta shit. Make it complete, I yell dance, shoot at your feet (Dance nigga!). Niggaz be weak, I found out you talk in your sleep. Since you a bitch, you came back, went in for more cash. Baseball both of your legs, I'll trip on your ass. [Chorus: Xzibit]. You never stop me cause you movin too slow. And we not the motherfuckers that you thinkin you know. It ain't the dollars it's the principle of it so love it or leave it. Forever hardcore, so you better believe it. In all black, full metal jackets that make you move back. Move units the same way I used to move crack. You never stop me cause you movin too slow. And we not the motherfuckers that you thinkin you know. [Xzibit]. Yeah, yeah, most of the time I'm totin a nine. in my waistline or behind this close to my spine. I write these, negative fines, and heat for lines. Last seen in a black trenchcoat, at Columbine. Peep the design, make your remains hard to find. I ain't afraid to exchange fire, just cross this line. Most niggaz got guns but still don't know how to aim right. I remain tight, sleep in a coffin, avoidin daylight. [Chorus]. [King Tee]. We sit upon a plateau, with guns and cash flow. Sadaam and Castro, terror to the last blow. I mash dough and half these cats you ass slow. It's relative, and all positively negative. It's like, cuz flashin his gat, thinkin he cute. while I'm paranoid, cookin that loot, urgin to shoot. +Assassinate+ the +Soul+ and bring life. A fascinatin flow by King Trife, listen. I'm in a fucked up position, my baby momma keep bitchin. Niggaz is dry snitchin, and switchin. Not to mention, my cousin cookin crack in my kitchen. So why the fuck you think my braincells keep flippin?. Plus most niggaz round these parts got weak hearts. Call theyselves thugs when they let the heat spark. You mark, cross me and pay that tax. Punch you in the mouth and take that gat, motherfucker!. [Chorus 2X]."
