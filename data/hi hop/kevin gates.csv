not the only one,"[Intro]. Let me out. [Hook]. Say you love me, yeah. Say you love me, yeah. I know that I'm not the only one. Struggles I done overcome. I killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one. [Verse 1]. Lay me for a brick layer slangin' weight. Fell in love, made a new mistake. Baby momma arguin', askin' where was I. Instead I ask her ""how we do today? "". Breakin' through the safe in pin with solid ye. I most likely blew through 28. Women shady, how come I ain't choose to hate?. Loyal to 'em how come I ain't see the play?. Couldn't see no wrong in people tryna help 'em. Wanna see my youngin's really eatin'. Goaltending, blocking blessings for no reason. One bedroom apartment watchin' killer season. Had my share, funny tell you while it's secret. People that you love and they not sharin' nothin'. See you pockets ugly, won't reach out for nothin'. I can't wait to catch you bitches out in public. Buyin' out the mall, fuck your bitch in front you. Okay too aggressive, other women love it. I don't kiss and tell, lot of artists wonder. Cut the bra, and punch it longer in her stomach. Rough and rugged, took some losses, money doubled. Toilet bowl, think it's shittin' on 'em, fuck it. Playin' chance and the bishop on the muscle. You would never love me like my daughter love me. [Hook]. I can't be the one you love. And I can't be the one you love. Struggles I overcome. Killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one.

Hoes in my clothes, underarms smellin'. Million man march this ain't Malcolm X. Welfare, receivin' government assistance. Get up out the bed, spend up all they check. How you don't know that, you ain't never gagged. What you mean by ye, talkin' sellin' crack. Embalming fluid runs through Montana. Thinking going back and peddle weight. Pills that Reedy stuck stopping up the Brig. Renegade hoes settin' up the trench. Junkies usin' H, it's a better feel. [Hook]. I can't be the one you love. And I can't be the one you love.

Late night we fussin' bout the rent. Eviction notice posted, I ain't notice. Focused tryna get another flip. Wasn't makin' half of what I spent. Tee Newman passenger, we lit. I just got with Mocha that's a lick. Conversation with the boss man, look. We was talkin' signin' him again. Women wanna clown in front they friends. Like you was not respectin' what it is. Listen when I tell you what it is. To be around you signin' a consent. You know I just got married to your friend. I done threw a ring around the dick. Diamonds dancin' every time I spit. Had to throw some bling up on a bitch. Self made stand up guy. God first, hands to the sky. All I do is ride nigga, yeah. I don't even argue about the bread. The money that you owe me, you can have. I can't even see me gettin' mad. I can't even see me goin' backwards. Know you wanna see me on my ass. Cuttin' up with Dreka fine ass. Swagger matchin', where'd you find that?. I just rode a stick with mad air. Please me let me enjoy the ride back. Please me let me enjoy the ride back. Could you please me let me enjoy the ride back?. I just rolled a stick with mad air. Cuttin' up with Dreka fine ass. Swagger matchin', where'd you find that?. [Outro]. See I live my life like you know I'm gonna enjoy this bitch cause you never know when this gon' be over.

excuse me,"[Intro]. I be hopin' sometimes for a moment to feel the light shine. If life is a gamble I'm willin' to bet my last dime. I know what it is to be victim of this bed I made so I lay. Bought this bread I don't play. Goin' through hell tryna make it. Not even heaven could stand in my way. [Hook]. Niggas talkin' and that shit annoying. See I pay my dues, you can't afford it.

I'm a real vic, money limp when I walk. Beat a bitch back in, big dick dinner soft. Big clip by the couch wearin' zips that's an out. Public housing, no authority and the clique got a house. Try to turn speaker off blip-blip with the Aux. Tuck somethin' close to you, eatin' grits witcha spouse. No bathrobe wearin' ass nigga. Breadwinner brick game hashtag emblem. Peace sign on the hood in Benz symbol. Still goin' off, make the clique get richer. Shots on her back and her chest to the pillow. Pieces come together, playin' chest with a picture.

Aw man, that bitch she go hard. Beat the pussy, till' she doze off. Aw man, that bitch she go hard. [Verse 1: Kevin Gates]. Turn on your headlights, pull in your garage.

That activity may fly with another type. Kissin, touchin, huggin, take our time and we ain't no rushing. When we finish I might call you later on, don't call my phone. Opposite of never go soft, Ray Nagin penetration mean I go raw. [Hook: Rico Love]. [Verse 3: Rico love]. Fuck you right, fuck you right, I fuck you right. Fucking right, I spend a hundred thousand bucks tonight. Real nigga, I got money and some good dick. Hundred million albums sold, still on that hood shit.

No disrespect was intended for kendrick lamar. Don't know shit about liquor and pools. While in the water they giggling twos watch. I hinder the threesome and lick her in pools. Follow me you. Niggas in twitter expressing they feelings. Because all they bitches unfollowing you. Talking that silliness not comprehending it. What the fuck I look like talking to you. This ain't street fighter I'm not good at kicking it. You must look at me like ken or ryu. A coward dies a thousand times. And a soldier dies uno. Immortals die zero, zero zero zero. Left up to me I'd rather die a hero"

Hoping you can help me through with those, things. Life switching it's night or morning with curtains open. Get through the boxes notice. The front of my shirt was soaking. Love to go in slow motion. I'm busting that pussy open. We sweating fucking the sheets. You scratching me when I'm deep. That ass clapping for me while. I stick my tongue in-between. Your nipples look like erasers. Look how you lookin' at me, grab your neck. Ready, set, grip your toes and kiss on your feet. Make your inner thighs, 69. You could be underneath. I'ma dog make you like those I love it.

hold ya head (the luca brasi story),"This goes out to those who in the grave. Loved ones emigrating, the others doing time. But we'll be just right. Hold your head, hold your head.

But don't ever hold your head down. Got it out the mud serving local in the trap. Couple faggots wanted me wacked, had me clutching gats. Pumping crack, crack smokers quickly coming back. I do about 55 ounces off of brick, it's jumping back. Neighborhood record label popping in my city. Dreadlocks, aqua green collar with a fitted. Headlock label say if I leave I get a headshot. Signed one contract, business venture proposal. Pay close attention, tricky dealing with hidden motives. Like I said I signed one contract, but noticed. Went to jail, came home, label playing me closer. Showed me two contracts with my signature and my social. What the fuck is that?. Let's be honest. When you check into a hotel. And you sign for your room you don't write. Your motherfucking social security number. Next to your signatur. I come they got my social next to my shit. On two contracts. I only signed one.

All I they ever told me was how blessed. I was to be under them. Reaper'll kill you, God's children ain't the children of men. This for those who got picked on and teased all their life. Unspoken motives of the cruel, on my knees every night. Black termal up under army fatigue with a pipe. Itching a brick of biscuit, no need to mimick pretenders. Indeed I eat a business when enemies would befriend you. Until they see you defenseless and send a nigga to flip you. Strictly dealing the district, they leave the building. it's history. Back controlling the city with vacuum sales and them digits. Shitting on you bitches who wouldn't lend me a penny. Smiling everytime I'm sticking my dick. In one of your women gates. A wise man told me that to get what you want. You gotta know what the fuck you want. A wise man also told me that a double-minded. Man is unstable in all his ways. I'm up in focus.

This no facade Peter tange in my cigar. The way I move may be peculiar to people I come across. Stress! This confession forever you in my heart. Wish you the best, in whatever endeavors that you embark. GATES!. [Bridge]. I got a heart that's full of love. With so much love to give. I often picture us together married with some kids. Victim of a broken promise I know what it is. (And all of your friends know I'm a gangsta!). Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?. Wishing I was there to lay onside of you at night!. Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?. I pray that heaven comfort you, so you should be alright, alright.. [Chorus]. I got a stupid house that's empty when I'm out on leers. When you're in love who gives a fuck about a non believer. When the lights go down and you're looking around. And you're asking yourself who's gonna love you (Ohh ohh Ohh). Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around. (Now you're asking yourself who's gonna love you.). Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around. (Now you're asking yourself who's gonna love you.). [Verse 2]. Making fast moves backwards, fatal attraction. I'll forever be your slave. I been caged up and captured. Drugs don't really ever make the problem ever shrink. But they don't release the endorphins that help me not to think!. Suicide's been contemplated irrational way of thinking. Attach a brick to my ankle and throw me over the deep end. Weekend, sleeping. Ugh I don't go to clubs ask me any question and. I might respond with shoulder shrugs. Connected for eternity when forces take control of us. Lucas Brasci get it in you should know what's up. Do this every time I'm the life of the party!. Know it's got a name but they don't know what to call me!. [Bridge]. Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?. Wishing I was there to lay onside of you at night!. Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?. I pray that heaven comfort you so you should be alright, alright.. [Chorus]. I got a stupid house that's empty when I'm out on leers. When you're in love who gives a fuck about a non believer. When the lights go down and you're looking around. And you're asking yourself who's going to love you (Ohh ohh Ohh). Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around. (Now you're asking yourself who's gonna love you.). Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around. (Now you're asking yourself who's gonna love you.)"

Dominion over this outer realm, mojo power like Austin. Starbucks with K. Michelle, in the car sippin' my coffee. I meant to say Kira Michelle, excuse me if I had lost you. If a bitch bad with a thick ass, whip dick out while she talkin'. If we in the car and she get mad, won't kiss ass, she walkin'. My new thing I just grabbed, cocaine paint retarded. Nother wrapped dash with wood. G. rain and the lamb skin like Spalding. Chris Porter at Auburn. Menace pickin' up when I called 'em. At the barbershop, a nigga. Philly had me uncomfortable I won't argue. You ain't know Nook was in the back room. Go with your move, he gon' off ya. That same nigga that said I look at him like a big uncle. Hate you the most be the people that love you. Shit gets so disgustin', mothafucka"

Am I wrong for showing interest in these women surrounding.. I'mma straight dick her down, and go.. No time to lounge with hoes.. On the grind, all the time.. I then been down this road.. Strictly need my C-Notes, can you keep up with my lingo.. Some a say life is a gamble, which means love is a casino.. Everybody just playing to win, think I made again.. Though many ladies pretend, hoping this ain't what it is.. This business I'm in, may make me taking a beating.. Would you still be my friend, when I'm lonely love.. Get 'em gone, cause ain't no one on the phone, but us.. Someone who strong when it's rough, someone who won't give up.. Ain't wasting time, hustle every night.. Promise everything is alright!.

[Verse 2]. People changing on me, I am so sick of the masquerades.. Grew up poor, had no dishes, ate off paper plates.. I'm taking aim, brought up in this life I know.. Baby you're a rider and I love when you ride it slow.. Motion for me girl, arch it to the ceiling.. Now bend over for me girl.. Pulling on your hair, while I'm gripping on your ass,. when I kill it from the back, know you feel it in your back.. Late night screaming, all of the right reasons.. Touching, teasing, blowing the might please.. Make it bite back, I love when it bite me.. Saying take some out, I know what it might be.. When your body go to shaking, you're raising your right knee.. Bit the pillow with your teeth, I know what it might mean.. I'mma keep going, I know that the light green.. Can't stay still, I'm stroking the right thing.. Climb in the bed, with a dime in the bed.. Don't tell me the spot, I'mma find it instead.. Big fine muthafucka, she a dime with the head.. Just got a text, never mind what it said.. iPhone ringing, I decline with a fret.. Which color should I press, lime or the red.. Decline or accept, next line never read.. Minus the time and the time been the best.. Told her what it was first time that we met,. But she cry and get upset every time that I left.. [Chorus]. Satellites, Satellites.. Never really made love but she gone get it right.. Emotions probably telling her, that she could stay the night.. But her friends all call us crazy, they don't give her good advice..

I dress up like a woman and then let it go. Narco trafficante, cocaina come from mexico. Double cups of the syrup, back to back, bad move. Matter fact shawty say she like my tattoos.

Dump a rack, get em snatched like a fucking man. Hard to move by yourself lot of killer ants. Wishing I could turn back set of different hands. Nothing bigger than the b, I got different plans. I ain't running up a shift yard. 30 Shots out the tec before it jam. Fist fought, live raw, diving in my bitch car. Shoulder and my lip caught hell on the pitch fork. What they doing? Satin screaming ""kevin where you going? "". You don't see all of these bad bitches I got for you. Want you to get that pussy raw and don't have no abortion. Diggin in your pocket, court appointed, child support you. Spend all your money then go broke, you know I support you. Ride with that pistol police catch you, then gon adios you. Then I'ma laugh while you in jail and act like I don't know you. Go rob that nigga over there, know he ain't got it on em. Cars pulling up, supplying em while on the corner.

Ball with the witchcraft, study every night. Philosopher's Stone, I perform another rite. Rite meaning ritual, created dry ice. Hid in plain sight wear the suit and tie nice. Mason mean more than a brick layer. Salmonella moving chicken got my chick paid. Poison that was giving, distributed in the streets. Find another way to eat, I'mma quit slanging.

Lot of days spent in the cage, wasn't what you think. Washing clothes with the toilet water, drinking out the sink. Hard mat hurt your back when it's no option. Everybody boxed in, trying to release toxins. Fuck a meeting we about to have a sit down. Not a part of this, pussy nigga can't sit 'round. Bread Winner business. model bitches getting dicked down. Get the phone back when they finish, get em' kicked out. All in favor for a favor for a favor. Any other matter we gon' bring it to the table. Organization gotta have communication. Full participation, Bread Winner's in the making. Fuck a meeting we about to have a sit down. Got the bread and basket. then we split it with the clique now. Bought a share together people feel like we the shit now. Passing through your section I ain't showing. No affection to a nigga or a bitch. Take a whiff no you sick now. Syrup, drinking out the bottle how I sip now. Ride around the bottom with the tint down. I'm a shooter, got a pistol with the dick out. True story, what I rap about I lived out. That's why I got a pistol with the dick out. Fucked up feeling when you get it from the gutter. Be the people in your own hood steady saying fuck ya. Way a nigga living when you see me in the picture. Difficult to tell the difference in the season. when I'm thugging. Heart cold, long nose, stumping through the jungle. Automatic that I'm packing, wearing jackets in the summer. Body being healed, having trouble with my left foot. Learned how to fight different, caught him with the left hook. Really pushing D, with the clip, cooking Ki's. Many probably agree, on Tv was the best look. Anticipated launch or a lift-off. Metaphor, going opposite of dick-soft. Mind on the ticket, out the mud seen Nicki. Album cover would make the dick spit, but it's still soft. Get out my cell when I shit, get lost. I'll punch a nigga down when I'm pissed off. Wanna wrestle, had to put him in a hip-toss. Lot of rap niggas backwards, Kris-Kross. Guess I never had swag. Pants tight on your ass, matter fact while you at it. put on lip gloss. Mind rambling, I guess it kinda slipped off. When Drake and Rihanna's song ""Take Care"". playing tears running down my face I ain't playing. miss laying with my bitch having real-talks. Laying in her lap with her fingers in my scalp. Get to rubbing on my back till I drift off (sleep). Affection ain't cheap, coming with cost. Paying all the bills when the rent call. Fucking with a Nfl player when his check long. Running back as if a running-back. Hard to stomach that you let him fuck for nothing. When you find out that the check gone (check gone). Found a ex-Nba player knowing that's wrong. Un-loyal you get slaughtered you get stepped on. Who your baby daddy? Picked me but you guessed wrong. Your mother mad cause she couldn't pawn me. Got it from the concrete. Will stand up in your chest under everybody. What you witnessing me getting richer. failed to mention that I'm winning. Same nigga that you slept on.

soldier man,"Say, say Tasha say Brianna run over there. and bring me my cup ya heard me. Bring me that right there. Nigga already know my swagger. sit on the ceiling with hopes of grabbing a million. If rap don't happen to happen. its back to bagging and pitching. How can a child heed they father. when he somewhere in the pen. 30 days from my release right back in the streets again. Prayers go to heaven, when you close your eyes. The gunshot sounds come as no surprise. When living in a soldier man town. When living in a soldier man town. No sunshine skies are grey. But we live this night and day. I Guess I'm living in a solider man town. I Guess I'm living in a solider man town. 750 Li, dive in the streets. You learn to shallow your pride or you die tryna eat.

My dawg gave his heart to the Lord, and got hit with life. At least we still see him, not at all freedom. Family pictures without you in em, we not at all cheesing. Something about your daughter. the way she be looking at me. Give her toys, and I spoil her. she still don't be looking happy. Niggas look crooked at me, symbol of success. Bread Winners Association got the emblem on my neck. Out of town Beto and Brian we talking brick money. A8, R8 Spyder, we talking whip money.

The mothers of my children got they own specific ways. Head first in the game, keep hunger pains away. When Grandfather passed away. I heard him say you the man of the family. Never thought the Judge and the Da's would try to slam me. Now I understand that it, ain't no understanding. Money in my hand, my respect, I'm demanding. Label label me reckless safe to say a loose cannon. Fast cars, fast broads, and penitentiary chances. Broke it off they like family, big dawgs got involved. Now the kid is outstanding. Nike sweats, White G-Stock. look who out standing on the block. Fiends passing, watching things harassing. Stop it, in the street I'm tryna see a profit. Can't go get a job, I ain't got no other option. True life confessions, expressing what I believe. Scars on the surface, with mines I can bleed. Everything I lost, eventually Ima see. Lay my life down, holding my weapon willing to squeeze. Stuck in the street life. Sucking my teeth like. Hustle to eat, while I'm, clutching my heat. Object of the game was to stack and get out of here. Shoulda never changed. so I'm trapped, can't get out of here. Prayers go to heaven, when you close your eyes. The gunshot sounds come as no surprise. When living in a soldier man town. When living in a soldier man town. No sunshine skies are grey. But we live this night and day.

twilight,"In 7th Grade, we promised. that we'd never break each other's heart. Fought with the pressure of deep depression. while naked making confessions. Underneath the covers, coloring in the dark. Gave Latoya my information and she ain't even call. Could it be women's intuition telling her I'm a dog?. Criminally involved, past-tense. on my prior history dealing with the law. And this is no facade, refrigerator in my chest. just like Omarion. I got this icebox where my heart used to be. Excuse - that's just a broken heart. I'll think that I'll just hang out here for tonight. (Say Gates, what you doing?). Playing songs on my invisible guitar. Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand. Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand. Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you. But I would go to war with God for you, baby. I'd go to war with God for you, baby. I would go to war with God for you, baby. I'd go to war with God for you, baby. Every time we talk, it's like you end up getting aroused. Standing, while I'm sitting down with my fingers. under your blouse. Still looking you in the eye, you're looking back into mine. If I told you I was different. would you understand the difference?. Try to suppress the feeling of this different way of living. Creatures of the night - we gon be alright. In the twilight. Skin gleamin', labeled a demon. Cause I can't even die. The curse of eternity. God created me, but why?. If I turn you into I, your age would. Never age and forever be by my side. Spoke about the wisdom that entered into my thoughts. The will of the universe, including the Willendorf. This is art. I'm a God. Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand. Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand. Alone, praying every day that. I can stop thinking about you. But I would go to war with God for you, baby. I'd go to war with God for you, baby. I would go to war with God for you, baby. I'd go to war with God for you, baby. I would go to war with God"

Settle down, it's 'bout to get explicit. Passed you the light, you lit it, inhale, you cough, I get it. Love the way you look at me, especially when you're tipsy. This is bound to be a wild ride. Wild ride, wild ride. Pussy drippin', yeah we callin' off, nigga. Hit you from behind, ass up and face down. And I live everything I'm sayin'. babe this ain't no make believe"
would you mind?,"Pussy good. Soaking wet, she say if I give her dick away she'll be so upset. Argumentative but not with me, it seems I stroke her best. 4th quarter pressure tongue kissin while I stroke her breasts. Lick her nipples, spread her pussy lips. Slipping off vicky secret panties rubbin on her clit. Legs open suckin on her clit. Situation in the naked never get enough of this... [Chorus:]. Would you mind [4x]. I'll be your soldier I can stroke you in slow motion. for a really long time, time, time. After you bend over imma grip your waist and shoulders,. kiss and hold you for a while, a while [3x]. When your legs around me I get high and. I don't wanna come down. Some might say I'm disrespectful,. I regret it in not asking would you mind [4x] if I pull over and. I fuck you in the bathroom stall for a while?. Would you mind [4x] if I pull over and. I fuck you in the bathroom stall for a while, a while?. Dedication, I'm dedicated. Lean with the weed This weak, Heavily sedated. Rhythmic patterns seem to scatter, you my meditation. Ill, the way I feel when you not here, you my medication. T-shirt, clothes seen, addiction got you itching for a heat. Dope Fien. Clothes on the floor by the door, no joking. I was in the shower, no towels, most steem. Body paint under fluorescent lights, glow in the dark. And love out the tub with the way you bend over and arch. Pussy in my verse, Then reverse, throw it in park. Sexin in the bathroom on a jet, we closer to God. [Chorus:]. Would you mind [4x]. I'll be your soldier I can stroke. you in slow motion for a really long time, time, time. After you bend over imma grip your waist and shoulders,. kiss and hold you for a while, a while [3x]. When your legs around me I get high and. I don't wanna come down.

wrong love,"Yeah, yeah. I don't really know what I've been doing bro you heard me. [?]. Flip from nothing. I got in and still I had to stash. The money came. Still wasn't sunny for me after that. My heart got strained wanted to blow my brains. Matter a fact. I gave the wrong niggas my love wish I can have it back. Flip from nothing. I got in and still I had to stash. The money came. Still wasn't sunny for me after that. My heart got strained I wanted to blow my brains as a matter of fact. I gave the wrong niggas my love wish I can have it back. When you came home, I was excited. I looked up to my cousin. The world been cold. My heart been taken. I got somebody who love me. [?] Port Allen in jail [?] feds. Kept it silent dying inside. I wasn't right in the head. I lied to you and what I said I shot myself in the head. Doing drugs. Easing pain. I hate to get out of bed. Even ran off on my daughter. I admit I was scared. I know I could've gave her order. I was better off dead. 5'7 in the cartridge. I ain't taking precautions. I ain't scared of a army. I was tryna lay in my coffin. Smoking without coughing. Early morning go walking. When my dog was still alive. We ain't never go without talking. Flip from nothing. I got in and still I had to stash. The money came. Still wasn't sunny for me after that. My heart got strained wanted to blow my brains as a matter a fact. I gave the wrong niggas my love wish I can have it back. Flip from nothing. I got in and still I had to stash. The money came. Still wasn't sunny for me after that. My heart got strained I wanted to blow my brains as a matter aof fact (as a matter of fact). I gave the wrong niggas my love wish I can have it back. Christmas, I don't celebrate. We on two different ends. We was suppose to be retarded. Big old house full of kids. We was suppose to cop Ferrari's. For your bitch and my bitch. Taking sips of lean with every blunt that we twist. Remember we fucked T together. Lied and said we was twins. We even did our bids together. You come out I go in. Late night at the car lot schemin'. On a big body benz. I done fucked my wife with you. Thats just how this shit is. Niggas in my ear been telling me 'on you they gone spin'. How do you cut me? I still love you I don't know how to pretend. Light lil blender with [?] just to touch on her skin. Take my pain out on her pussy and then be puzzled again. Flip from nothing. I got in and still I had to stash. The money came. Still wasn't sunny for me after that. My heart got strained I wanted to blow my brains as a matter of fact. I gave the wrong niggas my love wish I can have it back. Flip from nothing. I got in and still I had to stash. The money came. Still wasn't sunny for me after that. My heart got strained wanted to blow my brains as a matter of fact. I gave the wrong niggas my love wish I can have it back"

Just go grab some rubber-bands. and watch this money pile in. Got two freaks that's super nasty, everybody's wylin'. Jump the brick the 55, Luca Brasi in rack mode. Drove a bucket, went from a Cutlass. to slamming Lac' doors. Shoes dusty, smell a little musty, I'm dressing bummy. Sad but touching. now when I'm shopping everything on the rack gone. Shawty here in front me. and she ain't much got a back bone. In two different lanes, live everything in my rap songs. Chat with other rappers and not too many done handled. They talented, for example, and more. Than half ain't done clapped chrome. Get your flap gone, for slipping, moving your flap wrong. All day I dream about stacks, bricks with stamps on. Trap-phone, Boost Mobile chirp alert with the gat on. On-side of me as if into pornography with a strap-on. See me flash on Tv channels (Never throw the towel in).

Got two freaks that's super nasty, everybody's wylin'. Never throw the towel. Women steady gettin' wild. Cashmere ostrich interior, on the ground. While my head is in the clouds, blowing loud by the pound. Eatin' crab cakes with your main line. in my hood it's goin' down. All they know is Kevin Gates. I wish you would get in the way. Through my section Willie Harry, with a weapon in my waist. My lil' Juvie jumpin' rope, before I left and did a bid. Used to watch her while I hustled. she would sing with her lil' friends. They like ""See that house on top of that hill. that's just where my boyfriend live"". That Phantom and that Corvette his. his watch cost a few mortgages. If you don't know what a Corvette is. I can show you what retawdid' is. Free Lee Lucas, clutching rulers, no solution, hard to kill. See me flash on Tv channels (Never throw the towel in).
