I only gave you the crown so I could shoot it off your fuckin head. Yall niggas fuckin dead, you heard what the fuck I said. I talk shit cause I walk shit, start shit, New York shit. The hawk shit, spark shit, the dark shit. And it been that way, fuck how a nigga live it's gon' end that way. Niggas is part of a game that I don't play. Never catch dog carrying what I don't weigh. That's three 45s, one 38, 173 pounds straight out the gate. I don't hate, got no beef but knock a nigga off quick. And I'm mad like a bitch and a nigga with a soft dick. Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit. Why the fuck you fucking with X? You must be fucking with X. Go catch a chicken, fucking with me you gon' catch a whippen. [Chorus: Jadakiss & DMX]. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. [Jadakiss]. Look don't try to apologize on your two way. Sympathy don't amuse me, go get your uzi. And let's make a real movie. Play bad guy and good guy til the hood die. Toast yall cowards. Now I know the reason why Pac ain't really like most yall cowards. Im'a show you how to swing the chrome for real. Dog this year we gon' bring it home for real. What you wanna bet the llama'll squash you. I been had a white fan base before the signing of Marshall. Boy Kiss is thorough, hit your girl. Put it all up her stomach til she earl. Yall niggas ain't nice ya lucky. So fuck it Im'a sell dope long as the price is lovely. And it ain't only the voice it's the bars of death. DMX and Jadakiss nigga guard ya chest. [Chorus]. [DMX]. When is they getting off our dicks, them niggas is clowns. How many dogs you let go up, still getting down. Like 'face said, last of a dying breed. For stomach and I feed still trying to eat. Lead by greed that's when you fuck up. Yall niggas gonna know when we hungry, you get stuck up. (What what?). What's up? Fuck a nigga yelling. Y-O motherfucker for real, yo Kiss tell 'em. [Jadakiss]. Sheet could kill, stomp niggas out boot the grill. I'll give you a reason why I'm the truth for real. Niggas can't fuck with Kiss, I mean that. Had to stop eating red meat cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs. I'm not one of them niggas and since you so richeous. Don't make me send your ass to Ala quicker. Niggas gas you to force your hand. Realistically you just a worker and your boss is my man. [Chorus - 2X]."
knock yourself out,"Uh-huh, you know where I'm takin this. I'm takin it right there - they leave me no choice. AOWWWWW!! Uh, uh, oh. [Verse One]. She said she was a model for a year and a half. And if she took her pins out,. then her hair would drop down to her calf. I knew her man, he was just up North. and would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North. Anyway I'm K-I-double. All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble. If you ready we could move, just lose your man. or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance. Or I might let you play in the garden. Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin. The estate got six locations. Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation. And I hate to brag. I know ya man really wouldn't like the Beretta but he'd hate the Mag. And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out. But in the mean time girl - knock yourself out. [Chorus]. Oh you modelin momma? (knock yourself out). Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out). Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out). Whatchu wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out). Wanna keep on dancin? (knock yourself out). Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out). Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out). Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out). [Verse Two]. Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself. Or you can get real freaky start poppin yourself. And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time. it's sorta like you watchin yourself, uhh. Front if you want, I puff a few blunts. and take a cruise in a Porsche wit the trunk in the front. She had the Jocko B'sure sandals, told her hop in. The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles. Attitude very high maintence; check this out ma. I'm runnin out of my patience. Don't sleep wit me? Then don't speak wit me. And neva talk bad bout niggaz that eat wit me. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. Aiyyo, honey know I'm waitin to leave. Keep dancin, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris. I'm like Big wit the murder mamis up in Belize. but I'll still fuck a chickenhead like Lil' Cease. I don't care if they model, bet they all gon' chill. First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill. And you might win some, but you just lost one. Kiss +Miseducates+ 'em like Lauryn Hill. [Chorus] - (Fades)."
letter to b.i.g,"[Intro: Jadakiss]. Uh huh! I ain't even good with writin. I don't even write shit. I just felt, I had to write this letter to BIG. Niggas is actin like..................letter to BIG. Uh, yo. [Verse One: Jadakiss]. Dear Christopher Frank White Wallace. Yeah it's your boy Kiss I just wanna holla. In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet. Kangol on the rack, a fresh pair of Wallies. You know I'm still the liquor and the weed child. And still got Branson on speed dial. And everybody's the king now. You ain't gotta be nice gettin shot is the thing now. Mafia was doin there best they seperated. Now Roc and Gutta doin a stretch, uh, yeah. Kim is still in it to win it. I seen Money L awhile ago but I ain't heard from Cease in a minute. People in power is queer. I could go on for a year 'bout how it would be if you were still here. The game got cheaper,. rappers is more commercially successful now. But the heart's alot weaker. You know me still got the flow that'll pop speakers. First option on offense the top feature. It's easy BIG all you need is a protool set. And I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet. Everybody that's somebody show respect. Only a matter of time before they notice that. I'm an impecable lyricist. And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this. They well aware of Kiss the light of the city. And I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy. I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man. Long as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan. Remixed the joints you had. But, they could never ever duplicate your swag (Never). Meanwhile I'm a keep it so on my lil' plans. And you might bump into a few of my lil' mans. Up there steppin with God. Down here Mister Cee in BK still reppin you hard. Tianna so pretty, CJ turned into a Lil' Biggie. Just a little lighter but so witty. On your born day, we get the highest. Groovy still the best with the garments, he keep me the flyest. Tonight, Patron is dead. Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Lim??o the head. And before I end it, I gotta say thanks. 'Cause not only was your time well-spent, it was splendid (thanks). ...Miss you, my nigga. One Love (So we tried to hard to understand). [Chorus: Faith Evans] (Jadakiss). So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away. (That was my letter to B.I.G., nahmean?). You were everything - you were everything. (I felt it was only right, I really smoked with them niggas). [Bridge: Faith Evans] (Jadakiss). So we'll just keep our heads to the sky (Drink wit 'em). (Sat wit 'em, talked wit 'em). 'Cause we know we're gonna see you in the next lifetime (Real shit). But it's never easy saying good-byyyyye. (See you when I get there, Biggie). Saying - good-byyyyyyyyyyye (Love you). [Chorus: Faith Evans]. So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away. You were everything (Why you had to go awaaaaaay?). So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away. You were everything (Oooo-hooo-oooo-hooo-oooo-hoooo...)"
we gonna make it,"(feat. Styles). [Jadakiss]. Uh, uh.... Fuck... the.. frail shit. Uh, cuz when my coke come in. They gotta use the scales that they weigh the whales wit. [Styles]. Carsons on the jeep, but Gotti made the prototype. Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo light. [JK]. Determined niggas make it. Kickin down the door and we burnin niggas naked. [SP]. The house costs a million, sittin on the beach. and the only thing I know if it's furnished I'ma take it. [JK]. My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360. We got the shit that the government got. Talkin money then you rubbin the spot. [SP]. Real niggas say that they be wildin. We on the Caiman islands. On a yacht wit our favorite albums. [JK]. a bad hoe and a plate of salmon. Smokin and drinkin nigga is you thinkin that our fate is violent. [SP]. I love my nigga for the fact that he real. and nobody on the faculty squeal, what. [JK]. and if you facin capital pun, pass me a gun. and I'ma give you time to run, while I rapidly peel, uh. [HOOK 3X: Jadakiss]. We gon make it. we gon make it, we gon make it. [JK]. I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent. So when I fly now I bring my cars on the plane wit me. In this case who's the loser. [SP]. ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba. Teachin kids how to read and write and use the ruger. [JK]. Motherfuckin niggas is back, Jada and P. We got water, (X, haze). Plus weight in the D. and I'm tired of hearin about old niggas that had it. and be the same old niggas that ratted. [Who cares?] Talkin 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin back. [SP]. Gun works official but niggas don't be wantin that. [Why?] Cuz they puss and they mans is lame. [JK]. We so for real in the hood we make candy rain. [SP]. I could easily send you to God. [JK]. But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job. If you can't remember the name. All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard.... [HOOK]. [JK]. Ja- da- mwa, I'll kiss you you bitch ass nigga. That the hood won't miss you you bitch ass nigga. Might find your man dead in the ocean. [SP]. He be aight though. [JK]. You know dead rappers get better promotion. Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth. Never say you can't do it til you try it first. Be the young niggas eager to pull it. but it's a message in everything trust me, even a bullet. Go to war with the eight and the pound. Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground. Cuz my shells is expensive. You'll know exactly why when you yellin in intensive. my fellas is offensive. Lucky cuz I got guns that crack your back. but that's not what I prefer I manufacture crack. and, niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel. but we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal. I'm comfortable far from home. Eatin right, gettin good rest either on the far or the foam. I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years. Sound anything like Kiss then sign right here. and, y'all just talkin, I'm doin it well. Jadakiss motherfucker I'ma see you in hell, what."

can't stop me (feat. ayanna irish),"[Verse 1:]. Mhmm, yes, I does that.. Stays hot, I ain't got to get my buzz back. What everybody trying to be now; I was that. They could never stop me; that's why I love rap. Been living the life, praising ice.. Bang the baddest chicks in the world, maybe twice. The swag, the gear, the bread,. all the whips is a year ahead. I only fear the FEDs. Forty-five on the other side of the peep hole. Head shot from point blank; call it a free throw. Funny, 'cause I had divisions since Calico. Back then, I still ain't reached my peak, though. Louie loafers, Pollo pea coat. Call me whenever the bosses meet, yo. I drove papi crazy, so the industries. never gonna stop me, baby. [Verse 2:]. I'm gonna call it confidence, 'cause I ain't cocky. I just know one thing: They can't stop me. Whether I'm on ""Ef"" or LA, or they swap me;. it's all good, because I know the gangsters got me. First thing's first ""they jar us"" abruptly. I treat the rap game like a large monopoly. One on one they can't guard me properly. But when they double team me the odds are sloppy. I move like them eighty milligrams of oxy. Send your sister back to your family knockneed. Got too hot for the grams, and got weed. In the rap bracket he remains the top seed. Revolver holds six; quick to blow three. Audio heroin, so you don't OD. Shooters know you, but you don't know me. The block is crazy, can't stop me, baby. [Verse 3:]. Once I start I ain't gonna stop the squeezing. And the gauze ain't gon' be able to stop the bleeding. And your girl ain't gon' be able to stop the weezing. When she get that phone call from the doc; we even. You could not stop me, so stop believing. Ring tone rap, this is not the season. I punch lines hard enough to stop your breathing. And the ladies will still pay a lot to see him. I'm gonna get rich long as I got my freedom. And usually when you get hit it's for a reason. If you in the hood, better dodge the Ds, and. watch your Qs, and be on your Ps, and. Thank you all for coming out this evening. Having a good time with your liquor, and treason. Even if they knock me, then continue to watch me. They still wouldn't be able to stop me"

I rap my ass off, I'm fightin' the champ with the glass jaw. at the Garden or Nassau. See me, couple hood niggaz behind stars. I heard you put a couple good niggaz bars, (Preme!). I might never sell that much. But you can bet your last 2 quarters, I never tell that much. Picture 'Kiss not come out swingin'. It's like going to see 50 at a show and he don't come out singin'. Yeah, you got a felony, but you ain't a predicate. Never the King of New York, you live in Connecticut. You don't be in the hood, you be in the woods. Fuckin' wit' me, is where you really gon' be for good. I hold the 4-5 myself, and hop out the Range on 1-4-5 myself. This is a true fact. Since when has it become cool to get shot and not shoot back. Trackmasters shelfed you, Bravehearts helped you. Then everybody felt you, now I gotta melt you. And don't try to pull rank on 'Kiss. Cause the niggaz I'ma send to do it ain't gon' miss. Be layed up stiff, I spit straight up 'piph. I did real songs with BIG, no made-up shits. And I don't got a problem with clout. You ain't get shot again yet, so what's your second album about? (Nothin'!). Your raps are pre-school, you made a lot of money, now be cool. 'Fore I swell up your lips like seafood. Can I get a mic check? You don't stand a chance. To dance with me dog, ya steps ain't right yet. Block is just fine, homie, the D's straight. Most likely your new CD is a weed plate. Bunch of love songs, 100% pure garbage. Just somethin' to break up buds on. You should just sell clothes and sneakers. Cause outta your whole camp your flow's the weakest. I'm in the town where the young boys is clappin', (clappin'). You runnin' around with the lieutenant and captain, (laughs). It'll take a lifetime to see 'Kiss. You had to get shot 9 times to be rich. Rat ass nigga, you's a animal. You's a motherfuckin' animal. Pig ass nigga, you's a animal. You's a motherfuckin' animal. Snake ass nigga, you's a animal. You's a motherfuckin' animal. Matter of fact, you ain't no animal. I'ma show these motherfuckers how to handle you. D-Block!"
could it be,"Artist/Band Jaheim. Song title Could It Be?. Album. Submitted by Terronald. Lyrics Huh, uh yeah. Bout to put it to 'em. With some ghetto slick shit, heh. Check it out, one time. For your motherfuckin' mind (motherfuckin' mind). Yo I'm saying they gon' smell me on this one. No doubt, he-heh. Check it out, oh yeah. Listen. On the cross town with the top down. Sounds banging out the backstreets (alright). Me and shorty two deep. She's flashing me thighs. Wind blowing through her hair. Baby we can take it there (take it there). But first I gotta make my rise. Baby slow down. My crib's on the other side of town. But from the look in her eyes. She was hypnotized. Rubbed her hands on my chest. And started getting undressed. Tell me why. Could it be my chromed out rims?. Break your neck when you see me lookin' good. Or could it be the ice you see?. But you tell me that you're really feelin' me. (that you're feelin' me, feelin' me, feelin' me baby). Could it be the word on the block?. I know they told you that a nigga got it locked. Tell me why you just can't stop. I'm thinking that it's all about me. What could it be?. I got the sixty inch flat tv, what?. Got it like DVD, whatever you need. I got the bubbles in the tub with the back rub (bathtub). Silk sheets baby to make love. Oh girl I wanna hit it in the worst way. After that you'll be coming back like every day (oh yeah). send you back to your girls with something else to say. How I hit it, split it, had you with it till the break of day. Could it be my chromed out rims?. Break your neck when you see me lookin' good. Or could it be the ice you see?. But you tell me that you're really feelin' me. Could it be the word on the block?. I know they told you that a nigga got it locked. Tell me why you just can't stop. I'm thinking that it's all about me. What could it be?. Could it be the drop top Benz. That got your friends going out on a limb. Sliding me numbers when you ain't watching them. Playing me close but I'm not feeling them. Could it be the time piece flooded with chips?. You with me cause I flex brigets around my wrist?. Or large amounts up in my bank account. You tell me you love me baby but what's that all about. Could it be my chromed out rims?. Break you neck when you see me lookin' good. Or could it be the ice you see?. But you tell me that you're really feelin' me. Could it be the word on the block?. I know they told you that I got it on lock. Tell me why you just can't stop. I'm thinking that it's all about me. What could it be?. Could it be my chromed out rims? (could it be my chromed out rims). Break you neck when you see a nigga dip. Or could it be the ice you see?. But you tell me that you're really feelin' me. Could it be the word on the block? (tell me). I know they told you that I got it on lock. Tell me why you just can't stop. I'm thinking that it's all about me. What could it be?."

Never meant to make your daughter cry. I apologize a trillion times. I'm sorry ms. Jackson (oooh). I am for real. Never meant to make your daughter cry. I apologize a trillion times. [verse 1: jadakiss]. Tried to diss kiss to the world. And it's your fault cause she said she saw you kissing a girl. The hood was behind her for her whole career. But now they've slightly starting to disappeared. Something about that,. She's always angry, might have been when them girls. trying to push her scout back. Needed some head room. So she went out and bought tyson's mansion with 18 bedrooms. She's a domestic boss. That don't leave no marks though, you got to digest those scares. In fact think you got to tell her to get back. Because every kiss rap is similar to a bitch slap. Too hard since way back in the school yard. She's hollywood though all she needs is a boobjob. Girl in the bubble, didn't mean to trouble her. Man but im a calla hoe, im double her. Really think you should tell her to chill cause. My resume is longer than a doctor bill was. I did the song with ja rule bigging the city up. She did the magic stick remix with olivia. She got more money but i get busier. Think somebody going to end up killing her. And when it's all said and done. After they've said i've won. All im going to say is:. [chorus:]. I'm sorry ms. Jackson (oooh). I am for real. Never meant to make your daughter cry. I apologize a trillion times. I'm sorry ms. Jackson (oooh). I am for real. Never meant to make your daughter cry. I apologize a trillion times. [verse 2: styles p]. Hood had love for this bitch. Cause she came from south side queens with a thug ass click. Bitch got change, and she changed. Now she don't fuck with the hood, probably give a nigga brains. Bitch got boogie on a nigga. Went from the hood to hollywood got a movie on a nigga. Bitch talking greasy like new york sting. Sucking down south dick that's some new york thing. And the bitch used to be cool, hood even liked the bitch. Used to listen to again in the weeds. She had stories of many men, times in the club and niggas that was wanksta but the truth was to see. Bitch aint shyt, she was real good at bluffing it. Ordered protection on the niggas she was fucking with. Now that's a hoe that you just can't trust. Hired cops, that's a hoe that you just can't touch. Bitch moved out new york when they were swinging them glocks. Bitch got a deep voice but she would be singing a lot. Bitch would sell her soul just to get on the charts. Want to front like she's gangsta but she got no heart. And she going to get hit by the mac and. All in the back and this time i bet the jaw will be cracking. She's going to get broken to fractions d block is the faction. All i can say is im sorry ms. Jackson. [chorus:]. I'm sorry ms. Jackson (oooh). I am for real. Never meant to make your daughter cry. I apologize a trillion times. I'm sorry ms. Jackson (oooh). I am for real. Never meant to make your daughter cry. I apologize a trillion times. Check this out right?. I don't say it.... I just play it.... How bout that?"
it ain't over til it's over,"I said we the best at making this green. I swear Mountain Dew ain't got nothing on my team. F is for the family that's holding me down. I think niggas know who run this town. A is for the action I'm all about. Blow a nigga head off, kill all the doubt. B is for the big boys with the grown money. And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money. Shots of ""Tron at like 4 in the morn"". It ain't over 'til it's over, Loso I'm gone. Lights stay on, they don't fade. Take my last call, don't hold your breath. Everyday make something outta nothing. Move a mountain and still keep running. Never come down, make no mistake. They can say oh that my end is on the horizon. When I wake, all I see is the sun rising. Just when I thought I said all there was to say. I get the last word. It ain't over till it's over. Just when I thought I did all there was to do. I give my best to you. It ain't over 'til it's over. Ooh-oh ooh-oh. It ain't over 'til it's over. Ooh-oh ooh-oh. It ain't over 'til it's over. I smoke weed, you sip on lean. People always sayin' what the hell is that mean. J is for the justice I did to the game. Lot of these niggas that's on is lame. A is for the way I airs 'em out. Coupes by the two's I pairs'em out. D's for the dope that a nigga still pumpin'. 12 hour shifts got the spot still jumpin'. Rockin' on 'til the block is gone. 38' is snub nose but the choppers long. And everything takes time so they say. But it's been on my side everyday. Every second gone is another way to come up. Bend the corner, crash into the jackpot. Twists and turns I can take. They can say they do that my end is on the horizon. When I wake, all I see is the sun rising. Just when I thought I said all there was to say. I get the last word. It ain't over till it's over. Just when I thought I did all there was to do. I give my best to you. It ain't over 'til it's over. Ooh-oh ooh-oh. It ain't over 'til it's over. Ooh-oh ooh-oh. It ain't over 'til it's over"

[Jadakiss] It's not that bad... Could always be worse, yaknahmsayin?. All you gotta do, is stay in school. Anything you wanna do you could do yaknahmsayin baby?. No matter what though, gotta keep your head up to the sky. [Jadakiss]. This goes out to, all the infants. in this cold world that was born addicted. And to all the section eight kids. Just remember these four words y'all - we gon' make it. The government keep on tryin to fool us. The system, keep on tryin to lose us. And all we can do is keep buyin computers. And (?) all now 'fore it start goin down. We gotta hold our head, keep our pride. Though it hurts when I see people sleep outside. Little babies with no socks on, eatin popcorn. We all know what they moms and they pops on. Out go the love when the drugs come. They never got nuttin for Christmas, and they ain't Muslim. This is a jewel, a lot of us was them. This is a jewel, a lot of us was them. [Chorus: Ann Nesby]. Your head to the sky.. my my, my. You can win - you can win - if you keep your head. As long as you keep - your head - your head to the sky. My my, my... [Jadakiss]. Uhh, to my lockdown niggaz keep your head in the sky. To my shot down niggaz keep your head in the sky. I don't know if it's better to ride, or better to die. And that's why there's red in my eye. Cause people don't know what the ghetto is like. Either you make it out, or the terrible life. I don't wanna be a broke bastard. And everybody in the hood got somebody in they fam' with a coke habit. You work for minimum wage. I'ma get in the game, get shot or a bid in the cage. It's a risk I gotta take - and I'ma be the nigga. with the bricks and the stash and the biscuit outta state. And even though I'm blessed with the gift. I gotta move cause the pain and the sickness gotta wait. I go extremely hard - why let up?. And I can breathe long as I keep my head up. [Chorus w/ minor variations]. [Jadakiss]. Uhh, uhh - uh-huh, uhh - uh... Aiyyo I come from a place where it's three strikes out. And your life's on the line, so we iced out. Summertime gettin money, three dice out. Tanktops, and jean shorts, we Niked out. Headbands, and four wheelers. Jeeps and Coupes and convos, about who know more killers. It's all wrong but it's all right. It's a small world; matter fact it's a small life. We all trip but the way to survive. is hold your head and make sure you fall right. And it's a quite fact, that whatever goes around comes right back. It's just like that. And we tryin to touch major paper. Everybody in the struggle it gets greater later. Never say can't, it's better to try. And you can breathe long as you keep your head in the sky. [Ann Nesby]. Don't you let nobody stop you, mm. Heyy, heyyy, yeahhh!. [Chorus - 2X w/ variations].

It's easy BIG all you need is a protool set. And I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet. Everybody that's somebody show respect. Only a matter of time before they notice that. I'm an impecable lyricist. And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this. They well aware of Kiss the light of the city. And I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy. I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man. Long as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan. Remixed the joints you had.

And you know ya man Jada shoot through the hood. She look so good that the chickenheads can't hate her. Ever seen a dime? she a hell-a one. Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one.

Since she a good girl that attend college. I don't let her give me brain I just let her give me knowledge. [Hook 2X: Carl Thomas]. She's a good, good, good, good girl. Such a real fine lady and a lucky girl. I don't want no nasty girl. I don't want no nasty girl. [Verse II]. I'ma show you the kiss of life sorta like Sade. G-class 5, the seats go sideways. Wit the see-through roof, OOF!. Rims so big they leave dents in the highway. My good girl ride wit me. She take over the wheel everytime I pull over to piss. She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips. Waking up to the turkey bacon over the grits. Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips. Later on she gon hook up spaghetti. She ain't worried 'bout Herm S shit she got it already. She said she knew about the game cause her father was heavy. Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy. I could zoom in the jag. She going shopping need room for the bags. I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world. Cause (I don't want no nasty girl). [Hook]. [Verse III]. She's a good girl, I love her for that. She got mad dough, I love her for that. Her moms is cool, I think her lil' brother a rat. Everything else is straight though other than that. She dont play no games, I love her for that. Or hang wit no dames, I love her for that. I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks. Attitude, reflex leadership. And the sex is incredible, I love her for that. How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that. And she like making love by the lake for hours. Or just chillin' on the block, on a crate for hours. This Jadakiss, and Timbaland. This is Raspy's world. And I don't want no nasty girl. [Hook]."

Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs. Never underestimate niggaz, or over trust them. Uh...yeah them M's is right in my face. I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace. If it don't jam, the Tech will spray. When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray. Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle. I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil. Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what. [Chorus: Nate Dogg]. The time to talk is up. So bring the heat, that time is over. While you running your mouth. I'm creeping up over your shoulder. A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything. I can get my hands on. Call my bluff, start acting up,. and I'll leave you underground. [Jadakiss]. I know how to get my pairs off me. They can cry and die from high blood pressure. cause tears are salty. It's a symptom if you bobbin your head. Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic',. now throw him a grip. When I get it, you already know I'm throwin them bricks. Puttin purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwin them nicks. That's right, homey, you can't move me. I ain't goin nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies. All you shootin is the breeze, a bootleg uzi. I'm just waitin on a que like Suzie, don't lose me. These penitentiary chances that I take. Should be able to get the mansion by the lake. But I invest my bread into something else. Into something else that'll make something melt. You just gotta feel the kid. if not rap for the fact of how real he is, whatever. [Chorus]. The time to talk is up. So bring the heat, that time is over. While you running your mouth. I'm creeping up over your shoulder. A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything. I can get my hands on. Call my bluff, start acting up,. and I'll leave you underground. [Jadakiss]. Aiyo, niggaz know the champ is in here. He took it from crack to rap,. now he put out two anthems a year. And I just wanna rock for a century. Then chase the book with the documentary. If you, can't do nothin other than flow. Life's a bitch like the mother from +Blow+, let's go. Don't make me put your heart in your lap. Fuck ridin the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track. Hop out lookin crispy, fresh and new. In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue. And, I don't know you.. But I know a man becomes a man. from all the shit that he go through. Ya'll ain't fuckin with Jason. After I cash in, there's really no justification. Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get outta line. Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up. [Chorus]"

And thats why my girl is with me. I love it when she layin in the bed with a pearl long vickie. The next best thing to a soldier. Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers. Just look in her eyes and tell she's real. Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel. The sex was crazy then and crazy still. And you know im from the streets so its crazy ill.

I only gave you the crown so I could shoot it off your fuckin head. Yall niggas fuckin dead, you heard what the fuck I said. I talk shit cause I walk shit, start shit, New York shit. The hawk shit, spark shit, the dark shit. And it been that way, fuck how a nigga live it's gon' end that way. Niggas is part of a game that I don't play. Never catch dog carrying what I don't weigh. That's three 45s, one 38, 173 pounds straight out the gate. I don't hate, got no beef but knock a nigga off quick. And I'm mad like a bitch and a nigga with a soft dick. Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit. Why the fuck you fucking with X? You must be fucking with X. Go catch a chicken, fucking with me you gon' catch a whippen. [Chorus: Jadakiss & DMX]. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again. Un-hunh, here we go again.

Play bad guy and good guy til the hood die. Toast yall cowards. Now I know the reason why Pac ain't really like most yall cowards. Im'a show you how to swing the chrome for real. Dog this year we gon' bring it home for real. What you wanna bet the llama'll squash you. I been had a white fan base before the signing of Marshall. Boy Kiss is thorough, hit your girl. Put it all up her stomach til she earl. Yall niggas ain't nice ya lucky. So fuck it Im'a sell dope long as the price is lovely. And it ain't only the voice it's the bars of death. DMX and Jadakiss nigga guard ya chest. [Chorus]. [DMX]. When is they getting off our dicks, them niggas is clowns. How many dogs you let go up, still getting down. Like 'face said, last of a dying breed. For stomach and I feed still trying to eat. Lead by greed that's when you fuck up. Yall niggas gonna know when we hungry, you get stuck up. (What what?). What's up? Fuck a nigga yelling. Y-O motherfucker for real, yo Kiss tell 'em. [Jadakiss]. Sheet could kill, stomp niggas out boot the grill. I'll give you a reason why I'm the truth for real. Niggas can't fuck with Kiss, I mean that. Had to stop eating red meat cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs. I'm not one of them niggas and since you so richeous. Don't make me send your ass to Ala quicker. Niggas gas you to force your hand. Realistically you just a worker and your boss is my man. [Chorus - 2X]."
we be like this,"[Intro: Fabolous]. Getting it on. Brooklyn we back. Ghetto Fab. [repeat 4X]. Like that I got on, I got on. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. From the rocks to the trees. We be like this. From the blocks to the P's. Streets be like this. From the cock to the squeeze. Heat be like this. Ghetto F-A-B. Keep it like this. [Fabolous]. I'm an ordinary gent, in a strawberry Bent. Air Force Ones, check out the Burberry print. It's the kid, who do you fuck with. Ya'll should stop starring, unless Gucci make bullet proof buckets. Street family boys, kisses on they cheek. And why the D.A. and see the whip misses in a week. Ghetto gotta admire, man on it like this. And Prada work, retirement plan on my wrist. Niggas don't like that I got on. It's easier to find Bin Ladden, then the nikes that I got on. I used to love apartments, now I'm laughing in a mini mansion. I feel like I'm in a glove compartment. I'm far from jealous. But you ain't smoking good if what you buy don't look like the ?. I'm the reason your chillin'. It's no problem ridin? up. Puttin' a few of these in your melon. Why I'm breezing and yelling, ghetto. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. [Jadakiss]. Ay yo, never get caught holding a gram. Never take a bitch word over your man. Stay close to him. Never let em know where you live. Never let get familiar with your dough or your kids. Put the toast to em. Always stay quiet and humble. But don't be scared to take it to the knife or the gun in a rumble. I could show you how to get your neck broke. Stretch coke, the middle of the ocean on a mean duplex boat. Look here, there is no competitor. See now with the space ship doors, they open up regular. Get it on with the hard plastic. My sixteens had niggas feel like they trippin' off acid. Trust me, I can't see a loss. Know that if you wack me, you can't be a boss. Ryde or die, cry or lie, get your hustle on. Hold the block down, for life, truly yours. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. [Fabolous]. Keep it like this. Keep it like this. We be like this. Streets be like this. Heat be like this. Keep it like this"

why,"Jadakiss]. Aha. It's dat real. Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets. Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt. And why them dudes ain't ridin' if they're part of your set. And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death. Yea, and why they gon give you life for a murder. Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin down. Why they sellin' niggaz CD's for under a dime. If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine?. Why my niggaz ain't get that cake. Why is a brother up North better than Jordan. That ain't get that break. Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly. Why is rattin' at an all time high. Why are you even alive. Why they kill Tupac n' Chris. Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Cris'. Why them bullets have to hit that door. Why did Kobe have to hit that raw. Why he kiss that whore. Why. [Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]. All that I been givin'. Is this thing that I've been living. They got me in the system. Why they gotta do me like that. Try'd to make it my way. But got sent on up the highway. Why, oh why. Why they do me like that. [Jadakiss]. Why would niggaz push pounds and powder. Why did bush knock down the towers. Why you around them cowards. Why Aaliyah have to take that flight. Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari. Why he take that bike. Why they gotta open your package and read your mail. Why they stop lettin' niggaz get degreez in jail. Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time. And why do ""niggaz"" lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes. Why a nigga always want what he can't have. Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag. Why did crack have to hit so hard. Even though it's almost over. Why niggaz can't get no jobs. Why they come up wit the witness protection. Why they let the terminator win the election. Come on, pay attention. Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets. Why I stay the hottest shit but we sellin' the least. [Chorus]. [Jadakiss]. Uh, yea, yo. Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar. Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it. Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch. And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch. Why rap, cause I need air time. Why be on the curb wit a ""why lie I need a beer"" sign. Why all the young niggaz is dyin'. Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron. Why they ain't give us a cure for aids. Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days. Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk. Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York. Why you forcin' you to be hard. Why ain't you a thug by choice?. Why the whole world love my voice. Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son. And you know why they made the new twenties. Cause I got all the old ones. That's why"
