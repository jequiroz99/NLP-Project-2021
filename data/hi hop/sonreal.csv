problems,"[Verse 1]. I've met with the angels. Danced with the devil in my head, and that's okay. I've tried to be the strongest. When I was the weakest inside, and that's okay. [Pre-Chorus]. I will wake up on my homie's sofa. Weight all on my shoulders. All for this dream tonight, dream tonight. I would fake it, hide from my mistakes. But fears, I had to face them just to be here tonight. [Chorus]. We've all got something to offer. Everybody got a dream. Everyone's got some problems, not just ones you see. Everyone's got some falling, everybody needs to speak. Everybody's got some problems, not just you and me. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems. [Verse 2]. We've tried. There's nothing wrong with being wrong sometimes. Just not me. Goodbye to all them L's I took last year. I'm on mine, J-O-B. [Pre-Chorus]. I will wake up on my homie's sofa. Weight all on my shoulders. All for this dream tonight, dream tonight. I would fake it, hide from my mistakes. But fears, I had to face them just to be here tonight. [Chorus]. We've all got something to offer. Everybody got a dream. Everyone's got some problems, not just ones you see. Everyone's done some falling, everybody needs to speak. Everybody's got some problems, not just you and me. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems. [Pre-Chorus]. I will wake up, on my homies sofa. Weight all on my shoulders. All for this dream tonight, dream tonight. I would fake it, hide from my mistakes. But fears, I had to face them just to be here tonight. [Chorus]. We've all got something to offer. Everybody got a dream. Everyone's got some problems, not just ones you see. Everyone's got some falling, everybody needs to speak. Everybody's got some problems, not just you and me. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems. Everybody's got some problems, problems"
