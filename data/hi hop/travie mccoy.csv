But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Uh huh. Thinking back when things were so easy. Got me laughing out loud, for no reason. I use to take them cans back and collect them nickels. Trading garbage pail kid cards for sweet pickles. The whole block used to have G.I. Joe battles. Yeah yer boy had the original storm shadow. And as of lately things have been slow. So I reminisce on when we use to break them windows. Yeah, Til I got snatched by the cops. With a wiffle ball bat and a hand full of rocks (Wasn’t me). Consider this song a throw back. Cause all I wanna do is go back. Ya’ll sing it with me. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.

And this was way before playstation. Rushing home to watch Video vibrations. Man I tell you Sherry Carter coulda got the business. And I cant forget Rachel from Caribbean rhythms. This was back when Rap city used to play the jams. This is how I first heard about the Wutang Clan. Banged 36 chambers all summer long. And to this day canopy’s my favorite summer song. And I can drop names for days. Of all my favorite artists who helped to pave the way. But, we probably need a lot more then just 4 minutes. So this is how I’m gonna end it. Everybody sing.

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Yeah, I’m on the bus in the back lounge. Sweaty, cold confused in another unfamiliar town. Another sold out show. Spilling my soul to a ton of people I don’t know. And I can feel my skin wearing thinner. 4th night no appetite for dinner. Shit goddamn well ain’t life grand. Getting paid to stand on stage with yer heart in yer hand. Sometimes I squeeze it til they get worried. If this is groundhogs day I guess I’m Bill Murray. And I swear I’m not complaining at all. I love each and everyone of ya’ll. All I’m really sayin is….. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.

akidagain,"Let the kid’s sing. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Uh huh. Thinking back when things were so easy. Got me laughing out loud, for no reason. I use to take them cans back and collect them nickels. Trading garbage pail kid cards for sweet pickles. The whole block used to have G.I. Joe battles. Yeah yer boy had the original storm shadow. And as of lately things have been slow. So I reminisce on when we use to break them windows. Yeah, Til I got snatched by the cops. With a wiffle ball bat and a hand full of rocks (Wasn’t me). Consider this song a throw back. Cause all I wanna do is go back. Ya’ll sing it with me. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore.

And this was way before playstation. Rushing home to watch Video vibrations. Man I tell you Sherry Carter coulda got the business. And I cant forget Rachel from Caribbean rhythms. This was back when Rap city used to play the jams. This is how I first heard about the Wutang Clan. Banged 36 chambers all summer long. And to this day canopy’s my favorite summer song. And I can drop names for days. Of all my favorite artists who helped to pave the way. But, we probably need a lot more then just 4 minutes. So this is how I’m gonna end it. Everybody sing.

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Yeah, I’m on the bus in the back lounge. Sweaty, cold confused in another unfamiliar town. Another sold out show. Spilling my soul to a ton of people I don’t know. And I can feel my skin wearing thinner. 4th night no appetite for dinner. Shit goddamn well ain’t life grand. Getting paid to stand on stage with yer heart in yer hand. Sometimes I squeeze it til they get worried. If this is groundhogs day I guess I’m Bill Murray. And I swear I’m not complaining at all. I love each and everyone of ya’ll. All I’m really sayin is….. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore. But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore (cmon). But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again. Back in the days when I was young, I’m not a kid anymore.
