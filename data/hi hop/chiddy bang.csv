sooner or later,"[Felexplaina Kuti]. I am going to play for you our first tune tonight it s going to be about four tunes. And the first tune, here it goes. 1, 2, 3. [Verse 1]. Now when them fights go down. Them lights go down. In villas and the village people might be round. They say that all the people gonna like me now. Because I talk about the issues in this life we found. All through the country people gettin' slain. Priority religion disobey, get hanged. I know some little kids quick to get militant. Just give them packs of the gun. They really feel the clips. They told me not to worry bout the struggle. And they don't gotta worry cause it's subtle. Tell 'em about the government takin' away the light. Aviation is ruined they say when you take a flight. Say when you take the continent from the white man threw. White man colonize wealth can't do. They fly G5 but they gotta land too. We explode like the landmines that they ran through. [Hook]. Oooooo, Ooooooo Ooooo Oooo. Oooooo, Ooooooo Ooooo Oooo. [Verse 2]. So we try palm trees in the sky. It's a beautiful day. I am just happy to be alive. I am playin' with slingshots with renewable goods. Think you got it tough because you're in the hood, negiative. I am positive you would be in upset mode. When you wear the same thing like you got a dress code. I guess I am guilty of being privileged. Cause while I am in the booth my cousin is in the village. I seen a boy with no father. His mom ain't around, life's harder. Picked up soccer he tryin' to go farther. Hair is a mess can't find him no barber. And this is what its like. When you ain't got a life. I'm all they got left. But they trying to do right. And they feel my plight. They giving them insight. I know we gotta win. So then fly me a kite. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. We get by, the weather is just right. Say good morning when I see you. Cause I gotta be polite. And I am livin' something different. Cause this can't be the life. You don't got a chance so you better focus on your plans. I try to grind like children that sell pure water. The land of the lawless muy slaughter. Negotiate your price I'll take your offer. In the market where they sell them what did that cost her. I try to chase the gold out here. But honestly its bumpy like the roads out here. And I advise if your salary is handsome. Vulu feli feli they will hold you for ransom. If you gotta take a glimpse of my family life. You will lose your mind Chris Brown on Grammy night. And this is what the news don't show. There is nothing on the table so the dudes the dude's don't grow. [Hook]. [Chiddy Bang: Speaking]. Yeah, you see what this is man. We done came through all types of os. We still got people out there now. You know what I am saying. I am doing this for my cousin Remi. We gonna make it out the village some day. Sooner....later"
dream chasin',"Eh, check the plans out. We work hard. I ain't asking for a handout. If I hit the booth I don't have to pass them grams out. And beat her well when the other thoughts ran out. They say they lost words. I got them puzzled like the cross-word. Harvard. I'm nuts, George Washington Carver. But you can never pay a boss peanuts. If it gets messy be prepared for the cleanup.

Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it. It too haunting. The task is daunting. Trying to get the labels on board while flaunting. But, let's make some music make some money. Get the rides. European ties, have models for wives. Sometimes I feel fated to pretend. Unsafe 'cause my crib is far from gated in. I'm a relic believe slightly the psychedelic. If I could take off would you consider me angelic. Hysteric. I'm the subject and the predicate. They hatin' on me tell me wheres the etiquette. If you Goliath, I don't have to prove I'm better than. I play David, I'm a forth year letter man. So Let em' in, can you hear me knocking on the door. Hard to breathe at this altitude where the oxygen is poor. Think Benz, I don't know what Pontiac means. And this is what happens when an insomniac dreams. (Chorus). We Chasin' the dream. So what is life the diamonds and the gleam. Get a job while I'm doing. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it. And things ain't what it seem. Make money to spend it.

Pay attention in school is something that I never could, uh. And know with a beat, gotta be steaming. And we could work wonders over logic and reason. We on the hype, now they call it a buzz. And how we get the party popping, Baltimore club, uh. MySpace they could replay next. And you gotta have Xaph for the DJ set. No matter how they ever play us, they can never replace us. And any way you slice it now, homey, they can't take us. [Hook - Sufjan Stevens]. You came to take us, all things go, all things go. To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow. We had our minds set, all things known, all things known. You had to find it, all things go, all things go. [Verse 2]. Say hello to the game, the people know my name. And do they really love us or is this just a fling?. And we be Peter Parker in love with the Mary Jane. So many people gone, so many people came. And, this that brand new spontaneous. Dope flow, intravenous, miscellaneous grinding. Better late than never, I'm calling it perfect timing. But we gon' have a little bit of fun cause when it's all done. You throw your sneaks up and call it a good run. I admit, that I would never rather them burn me. I don't know where I'm headed. but I know it's a journey. And my bags is packed, so can you hand me my itinerary?. I get attention like a soldier in the military. This is what you gotta notice today. We promise to make sure they never throw us away. [Hook]. You came to take us, all things go, all things go. To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow. We had our minds set, all things known, all things known. You had to find it, all things go, all things go"

cameras,"Can I take a picture and ask for the permission?. And you don't really have to, homie it's your decision. So nervous, showing your friends is the only purpose. And you just wanted something that would make it all worth it. Well here's a ticket, I would gladly oblige. You saw me from afar so a scheme you had to devise. And I said baby you fine, had some things on my mind. You slip me your number, said call me at a moment in time. Don't mind if I do, hashtag time is money. So I'm focused on putting some extra paper in my cashbag. If I was broke bummy, that would be inadequate. But if they trying to get swelly, then I'm the advocate.

does she love me?,"[Verse 1]. Is he moving too fast? Is she moving too slow?. She telling me that I'm silly, but I'm only 2-0. And it sucks that she just want to be friends with me. I try to put her on where I'm at mentally. I'm full of energy. At times I need a remedy. For lack of things that interest me. But still her body is tempting me. She just keep rejecting me. Why she keep stressing me?. Screaming like ""Don't touch me bitch, I don't got leprosy"". Maybe we wasn't meant to be. But I was down Bonnaroo, Tennessee. In the RV, I can shut down a stage. Casey had the veggies on the bus, we smoked a pound of haze. Digress the tree can cold stress. When you feeling a bad bitch, but she showing you no interest. Sending letters with no address. And she never gon' get it so let it rest. [Hook x2]. Does she love me?. No sir. Does she want me?. No sir. I think she hates me. What has she done for me lately?. [Verse 2]. I'm high with no intent to land. I seem to fall for the girls with the short attention spans. Who just wanna rendezvous. I would take her on a date, to a nice restaurant. But I got too much on my plate. Said I'm here for a day. She hit me three hours late. Found out I left the city, bet she had the sour face. Told her I would kick it with her whenever I return. But that was based on the premise that she was my concern. Searching for serious, life. Then I was fast. Had me speeding on this racetrack, furious. The kinda chick, the flyest nigga in the school he had her. But eff that, I'm trying to focus on what truly matters. I like em usually bad, always on punishment. Having a conversation, wishing I could punish it. And why the fantasy so far from the truth, huh?. Running in circles playing Duck, Duck, Goose, huh?. We take the shit any slower, then we gonna hold up traffic. Only hit the blunt once, then she fuckin' pass it. I knew we wasn't compatible. Quarterback my feelings to the side, that's a lateral. I wish that I could be satisfied. I wish you would let me have a try. But there's a problem with you and I. Now it's Chi-town, do or die. [Hook]. . [By:ludias]"

I'm just trying not push myself away from you. [VERSE 1]. I know we arguing, I know we fight a lot. You always think I'm wrong, I think I'm right a lot. And when you see me don't I always make your day. You from BK, but you can't always have it your way. She wanna hit the city, ripping the mall. I always seem to be busy, she expecting my call. The fast life could make us happiest, upsettin' us all. Cause all the anniversaries, forgettin' 'em all. But don't be mad, love, I know where it's at love. She Jolie but it's pitiful, that's that Brad love. What happens when it all goes wrong, we was nice, generosity. And impossibly enough, it's animosity. I think I gotta just change up my game plan. Cause she and gone fall back in love with the same man. But no matter what weather or what the rain bring. In the end I'm coming back for the same thing. [HOOK]. [VERSE 2]. Yeah, shorty just vanished on me. She disappeared and yet I do not have no damage on me. Some times I feel she's a burden I can't manage on me. She say I'm cocky cause I got all of the cameras on me. But is it my fault, or is it your self-esteem?. And got you feelin like you're a prisoner to my dream. Parents just don't understand, and neither do y'all. You wanna hype me up and leave me there but I don't blue ball. And I say blue ball, cause let me tell you. what them guys will teach you any day. And then you left but fuck it I don't need you anyways. The mentality of love gone wrong, yeah. To work it out but we just don't get along, yeah. I know it's messed up, we all, affected. Tryin to get through, and the call, rejected. And that has changed, if I was ever close to your fragile frame. I'd be looking for the words, playing Scrabble games. [HOOK]. Now everybody say [x2]. [HOOK x2]"

sooner or later,"[Felexplaina Kuti]. I am going to play for you our first tune tonight it s going to be about four tunes. And the first tune, here it goes. 1, 2, 3. [Verse 1]. Now when them fights go down. Them lights go down. In villas and the village people might be round. They say that all the people gonna like me now. Because I talk about the issues in this life we found. All through the country people gettin' slain. Priority religion disobey, get hanged. I know some little kids quick to get militant. Just give them packs of the gun. They really feel the clips. They told me not to worry bout the struggle. And they don't gotta worry cause it's subtle. Tell 'em about the government takin' away the light. Aviation is ruined they say when you take a flight. Say when you take the continent from the white man threw. White man colonize wealth can't do. They fly G5 but they gotta land too. We explode like the landmines that they ran through. [Hook]. Oooooo, Ooooooo Ooooo Oooo. Oooooo, Ooooooo Ooooo Oooo. [Verse 2]. So we try palm trees in the sky. It's a beautiful day. I am just happy to be alive. I am playin' with slingshots with renewable goods. Think you got it tough because you're in the hood, negiative. I am positive you would be in upset mode. When you wear the same thing like you got a dress code. I guess I am guilty of being privileged. Cause while I am in the booth my cousin is in the village. I seen a boy with no father. His mom ain't around, life's harder. Picked up soccer he tryin' to go farther. Hair is a mess can't find him no barber. And this is what its like. When you ain't got a life. I'm all they got left. But they trying to do right. And they feel my plight. They giving them insight. I know we gotta win. So then fly me a kite. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. We get by, the weather is just right. Say good morning when I see you. Cause I gotta be polite. And I am livin' something different. Cause this can't be the life. You don't got a chance so you better focus on your plans. I try to grind like children that sell pure water. The land of the lawless muy slaughter. Negotiate your price I'll take your offer. In the market where they sell them what did that cost her. I try to chase the gold out here. But honestly its bumpy like the roads out here. And I advise if your salary is handsome. Vulu feli feli they will hold you for ransom. If you gotta take a glimpse of my family life. You will lose your mind Chris Brown on Grammy night. And this is what the news don't show. There is nothing on the table so the dudes the dude's don't grow. [Hook]. [Chiddy Bang: Speaking]. Yeah, you see what this is man. We done came through all types of os.

I'm fighting with myself. Don't offer the condolence. I'm Dreamin. (Chorus). We Chasin' the dream. So what is life the diamonds and the gleam. Get a job while I'm doing it. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it. And things ain't what it seem. Make money to spend it. I got my scheme. Work hard while we doin' it. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it. It too haunting. The task is daunting. Trying to get the labels on board while flaunting. But, let's make some music make some money. Get the rides. European ties, have models for wives. Sometimes I feel fated to pretend. Unsafe 'cause my crib is far from gated in. I'm a relic believe slightly the psychedelic. If I could take off would you consider me angelic. Hysteric. I'm the subject and the predicate. They hatin' on me tell me wheres the etiquette. If you Goliath, I don't have to prove I'm better than. I play David, I'm a forth year letter man. So Let em' in, can you hear me knocking on the door. Hard to breathe at this altitude where the oxygen is poor. Think Benz, I don't know what Pontiac means. And this is what happens when an insomniac dreams. (Chorus). We Chasin' the dream. So what is life the diamonds and the gleam. Get a job while I'm doing. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it. And things ain't what it seem. Make money to spend it. I got my scheme. Work hard while we doin' it. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it"

I bet you this, you ain't next to this. Cause my flow is like a light tantrum. And if you feelin' swelly, this is your anthem. Passport gettin' used up please stamp 'em. Said that shorty in the lobby a dancer. She down to get it? Yes is the obvious answer. I'mma spend this money, make it back. Gettin' first place in fact. Cause we give 'em dope, Xaphoon he could lace the tracks. Baggies is purple and yellow just like a Laker hat. You don't fuck with Chiddy I see you rockin' your hater hat.

Pay attention in school is something that I never could, uh. And know with a beat, gotta be steaming. And we could work wonders over logic and reason. We on the hype, now they call it a buzz. And how we get the party popping, Baltimore club, uh. MySpace they could replay next. And you gotta have Xaph for the DJ set. No matter how they ever play us, they can never replace us. And any way you slice it now, homey, they can't take us. [Hook - Sufjan Stevens]. You came to take us, all things go, all things go. To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow. We had our minds set, all things known, all things known. You had to find it, all things go, all things go. [Verse 2]. Say hello to the game, the people know my name. And do they really love us or is this just a fling?. And we be Peter Parker in love with the Mary Jane. So many people gone, so many people came. And, this that brand new spontaneous. Dope flow, intravenous, miscellaneous grinding. Better late than never, I'm calling it perfect timing. But we gon' have a little bit of fun cause when it's all done. You throw your sneaks up and call it a good run. I admit, that I would never rather them burn me. I don't know where I'm headed. but I know it's a journey. And my bags is packed, so can you hand me my itinerary?. I get attention like a soldier in the military. This is what you gotta notice today. We promise to make sure they never throw us away. [Hook]. You came to take us, all things go, all things go. To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow. We had our minds set, all things known, all things known. You had to find it, all things go, all things go"

cameras,"Can I take a picture and ask for the permission?. And you don't really have to, homie it's your decision. So nervous, showing your friends is the only purpose. And you just wanted something that would make it all worth it. Well here's a ticket, I would gladly oblige. You saw me from afar so a scheme you had to devise. And I said baby you fine, had some things on my mind. You slip me your number, said call me at a moment in time. Don't mind if I do, hashtag time is money. So I'm focused on putting some extra paper in my cashbag. If I was broke bummy, that would be inadequate. But if they trying to get swelly, then I'm the advocate.

Yeah these days, pussy, money, weed, need three things. Shit I'm prepared to grapple with whatever these brings. Spazzing on tracks at home, on calm things. And planning getaway dates with your girl in Palm Springs. But that's neither here nor there, we be flying everywhere. Yeah I am the pilot of the newly launched Swelly Air. And what city are we headed to and where's the telly there?. We gon' need some dutches there, we gon' hit the deli there. That's if you're wondering, fanfare humbling.

does she love me?,"[Verse 1]. Is he moving too fast? Is she moving too slow?. She telling me that I'm silly, but I'm only 2-0. And it sucks that she just want to be friends with me. I try to put her on where I'm at mentally. I'm full of energy. At times I need a remedy. For lack of things that interest me. But still her body is tempting me. She just keep rejecting me. Why she keep stressing me?. Screaming like ""Don't touch me bitch, I don't got leprosy"". Maybe we wasn't meant to be. But I was down Bonnaroo, Tennessee. In the RV, I can shut down a stage. Casey had the veggies on the bus, we smoked a pound of haze. Digress the tree can cold stress. When you feeling a bad bitch, but she showing you no interest. Sending letters with no address. And she never gon' get it so let it rest. [Hook x2]. Does she love me?. No sir. Does she want me?. No sir. I think she hates me. What has she done for me lately?. [Verse 2]. I'm high with no intent to land. I seem to fall for the girls with the short attention spans. Who just wanna rendezvous. I would take her on a date, to a nice restaurant. But I got too much on my plate. Said I'm here for a day. She hit me three hours late. Found out I left the city, bet she had the sour face. Told her I would kick it with her whenever I return. But that was based on the premise that she was my concern. Searching for serious, life. Then I was fast. Had me speeding on this racetrack, furious. The kinda chick, the flyest nigga in the school he had her. But eff that, I'm trying to focus on what truly matters. I like em usually bad, always on punishment. Having a conversation, wishing I could punish it. And why the fantasy so far from the truth, huh?. Running in circles playing Duck, Duck, Goose, huh?. We take the shit any slower, then we gonna hold up traffic. Only hit the blunt once, then she fuckin' pass it. I knew we wasn't compatible. Quarterback my feelings to the side, that's a lateral. I wish that I could be satisfied. I wish you would let me have a try. But there's a problem with you and I. Now it's Chi-town, do or die. [Hook]. . [By:ludias]"
dream chasin',"Eh, check the plans out. We work hard. I ain't asking for a handout. If I hit the booth I don't have to pass them grams out. And beat her well when the other thoughts ran out. They say they lost words. I got them puzzled like the cross-word. Harvard. I'm nuts, George Washington Carver. But you can never pay a boss peanuts. If it gets messy be prepared for the cleanup. But this thing called success is so strange. Because you can get notoriety and still ride the train. Make it in it's entirety and search for the fame. But I'm still Michael Phelps swimmin' in my lane. Where's Lois?. Me, I'm Superman,I'm just here to save the day. Or at least I thought I was. Til I flew in the save her. And met my opponent. I'm fighting with myself. Don't offer the condolence. I'm Dreamin. (Chorus). We Chasin' the dream. So what is life the diamonds and the gleam. Get a job while I'm doing it. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it. And things ain't what it seem. Make money to spend it. I got my scheme. Work hard while we doin' it. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it. It too haunting. The task is daunting. Trying to get the labels on board while flaunting. But, let's make some music make some money. Get the rides. European ties, have models for wives. Sometimes I feel fated to pretend. Unsafe 'cause my crib is far from gated in. I'm a relic believe slightly the psychedelic. If I could take off would you consider me angelic. Hysteric. I'm the subject and the predicate. They hatin' on me tell me wheres the etiquette. If you Goliath, I don't have to prove I'm better than. I play David, I'm a forth year letter man. So Let em' in, can you hear me knocking on the door. Hard to breathe at this altitude where the oxygen is poor. Think Benz, I don't know what Pontiac means. And this is what happens when an insomniac dreams. (Chorus). We Chasin' the dream. So what is life the diamonds and the gleam. Get a job while I'm doing. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it. And things ain't what it seem. Make money to spend it. I got my scheme. Work hard while we doin' it. Promise to stay true in it. Doin' it. But never let another soul ruin it"

[Verse 1]. We the realest tell em' run it back. Problems money come with that. I just ease the pain by chopping trees like a lumberjack. Thundercat, you ain't even ready for my summer raps. Coolin' on a minute I'm in to take the world, yeah I'm finna. It's young kidster, ain't no body hotter than. Soon as I step in the building, shit she forgot her man. College ran to the point I had to leave, was not a fan. Maybe a little not my email get a lot of spam. I'mma wild out, basically. That means I probably don't care about what you say to me. I got a couple bad bitches, Lord, pray for me. Look in the mirror we the shit that they pray to be. And they pay to me. Roll the blunts make a mixed drink. And don't you dare say that I ever care what a bitch think. She ain't a single but for me she tryna lip sync. And once the lips link, now that's instinct. [Hook] (x2). [Bridge] (x2). Yeah, I'mma need you to do it. DJ run it back so the people move to it. Yeah, I'mma need you to do it. DJ run it back so the crowd go stupid. [Verse 2]. Yeah, and I ain't even on that other shit.

sooner or later,"[Felexplaina Kuti]. I am going to play for you our first tune tonight it s going to be about four tunes. And the first tune, here it goes. 1, 2, 3. [Verse 1]. Now when them fights go down. Them lights go down. In villas and the village people might be round. They say that all the people gonna like me now. Because I talk about the issues in this life we found. All through the country people gettin' slain. Priority religion disobey, get hanged. I know some little kids quick to get militant. Just give them packs of the gun. They really feel the clips. They told me not to worry bout the struggle. And they don't gotta worry cause it's subtle. Tell 'em about the government takin' away the light. Aviation is ruined they say when you take a flight. Say when you take the continent from the white man threw. White man colonize wealth can't do. They fly G5 but they gotta land too. We explode like the landmines that they ran through. [Hook]. Oooooo, Ooooooo Ooooo Oooo. Oooooo, Ooooooo Ooooo Oooo. [Verse 2]. So we try palm trees in the sky. It's a beautiful day. I am just happy to be alive. I am playin' with slingshots with renewable goods. Think you got it tough because you're in the hood, negiative. I am positive you would be in upset mode. When you wear the same thing like you got a dress code. I guess I am guilty of being privileged. Cause while I am in the booth my cousin is in the village. I seen a boy with no father. His mom ain't around, life's harder. Picked up soccer he tryin' to go farther. Hair is a mess can't find him no barber. And this is what its like. When you ain't got a life. I'm all they got left. But they trying to do right. And they feel my plight. They giving them insight. I know we gotta win. So then fly me a kite. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. We get by, the weather is just right. Say good morning when I see you. Cause I gotta be polite. And I am livin' something different. Cause this can't be the life. You don't got a chance so you better focus on your plans. I try to grind like children that sell pure water. The land of the lawless muy slaughter. Negotiate your price I'll take your offer. In the market where they sell them what did that cost her. I try to chase the gold out here. But honestly its bumpy like the roads out here. And I advise if your salary is handsome. Vulu feli feli they will hold you for ransom. If you gotta take a glimpse of my family life. You will lose your mind Chris Brown on Grammy night. And this is what the news don't show. There is nothing on the table so the dudes the dude's don't grow. [Hook]. [Chiddy Bang: Speaking]. Yeah, you see what this is man. We done came through all types of os. We still got people out there now. You know what I am saying. I am doing this for my cousin Remi. We gonna make it out the village some day. Sooner....later"
talking to myself,"[HOOK]. If you ever see me talking to myself. I'm just running through the words I have to say to you. Is it over, or is it too soon to tell?. I'm just trying not push myself away from you. [VERSE 1]. I know we arguing, I know we fight a lot. You always think I'm wrong, I think I'm right a lot. And when you see me don't I always make your day. You from BK, but you can't always have it your way. She wanna hit the city, ripping the mall. I always seem to be busy, she expecting my call. The fast life could make us happiest, upsettin' us all. Cause all the anniversaries, forgettin' 'em all. But don't be mad, love, I know where it's at love. She Jolie but it's pitiful, that's that Brad love. What happens when it all goes wrong, we was nice, generosity. And impossibly enough, it's animosity. I think I gotta just change up my game plan. Cause she and gone fall back in love with the same man. But no matter what weather or what the rain bring. In the end I'm coming back for the same thing. [HOOK]. [VERSE 2]. Yeah, shorty just vanished on me. She disappeared and yet I do not have no damage on me. Some times I feel she's a burden I can't manage on me. She say I'm cocky cause I got all of the cameras on me. But is it my fault, or is it your self-esteem?. And got you feelin like you're a prisoner to my dream. Parents just don't understand, and neither do y'all. You wanna hype me up and leave me there but I don't blue ball. And I say blue ball, cause let me tell you. what them guys will teach you any day. And then you left but fuck it I don't need you anyways. The mentality of love gone wrong, yeah. To work it out but we just don't get along, yeah. I know it's messed up, we all, affected. Tryin to get through, and the call, rejected. And that has changed, if I was ever close to your fragile frame. I'd be looking for the words, playing Scrabble games. [HOOK]. Now everybody say [x2].
