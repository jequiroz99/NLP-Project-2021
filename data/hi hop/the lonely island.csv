I just had sex (Ay). And it felt so good (Felt so good). A woman let me put my penis inside of her (Her). I wanna tell the world. To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it. (Doesn't really make sense) But man, screw it. (I ain't one to argue with a good thing). She could be my wife!. (That good?). The best thirty seconds of my life. I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her. Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure. With that in mind, a soft, nice-smellin' girl's better. Plus she let me wear my chain. And my turtleneck sweaters. So this one's dedicated to them girls. That let us flop around on top of them. If you're near or far, whether short or tall. We wanna thank you all for lettin' us fuck you. She kept lookin' at her watch (Doesn't matter, had sex!). But I cried the whole time (Doesn't matter, had sex!).

yolo (feat. adam levine & kendrick lamar),"(YOLO) YOLO, you only live once. The battle cry of a generation. This life is a precious gift. So don't get too crazy. It's not worth the risk. You know that we are still young. So don't be dumb. Don't trust anyone. Cause you only live once. Ugh, you only live once. Thats the motto. So take a chill pill. Ease off the throttle. Never go to loud clubs. Cause it's bad for your ears. Your friends will all be sorry. When they can't hear. And stay the hell away from drugs. Cause they're not legal. Then bury all your money in the backyard. Like a beagle. Cause you should never trust a bank. They've been known to fail. And never travel by car, a bus. Boat or by rail. And don't travel by plane. And don't travel at all. Built a bomb shelter basement. With titanium walls. And wear titanium suits. In case pianos fall on ya. And never go in saunas. Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas. And never take the stairs. Cause they're oftenl unsafe. You only live once. Don't let it go to waste. You know that we are still young. So hold off on the fun. Cook your meat 'til it's done. Cause you only live once. Yeah. And here's another piece of advice:. Stay away from kids. Cause their hair is filled with mad lice. There's no such thing. As too much Purell. This a cautionary tale. Word to George Orwell. So don't 1980-force. Any plugs into sockets. Always wear a chastity belt. And triple lock it. Then hire a taster. Make him check your food for poison. And if you think your mailman is a spy. Then destroy him. No blankets or pajamas. They can kill you in your sleep. Two words about furniture:. Killing machines. Board your windows up. The sun is bad for your health. And always wear a straight jacket. So your safe from yourself. Take no chances (no chances). Stop freelancin' (right now). Invest in your future. Don't dilute your finances (uh huh). 401K, make sure it's low risk. Then get some real estate (how much?). 4.2% Thirty year mortgage. That's important, that's a great deal. And if you can't afford it. Don't forge it on your last bill. Renting is for suckers right now. A dependable savings. And you'll retire with money in your account. Beast.. YOLO, say no no. Isolate yourself. And just roll solo. Be care-folo. You oughta look out. Also stands for YOLO. You know that we are still young. Burn the prints off your thumbs. Then pull out all your teeth. So you can't bite your tongue. Only on this earth for a short time, time. So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die. Just take our advice and hide. And scream YOLO to the sky. You oughta look out"

So excited to see her, I went straight to the Louvre. I heard she's exquisite, so I bought my ticket. Pushed my way to the front of the crowd. And I couldn't believe what I saw. [Chorus 1]. Mona Lisa, you're an overrated piece of shit. With your terrible style and your dead shark eyes. And your smirk like you're hiding a dick. What the fuck is this garbage?. Mona Lisa, the original basic bitch. Traveled thousands of miles to see your beautiful smile. Talk about a bait and switch, you ugly. [Verse 2]. I'm headed to Cairo to see the pyramids. But what did I find there? A dirty pile of bricks. There was trash all over and a very foul odor. The smell was out of a camel's ass. But even that wasn't as bad as. [Chorus 2]. Mona Lisa, you're worse than the pyramids. Can someone explain why the whole wide world. Is obsessed with a Garbage Pail Kid. Looks like a Garbage Pail Kid. And Davinci must have sucked an art historian's dick. To get this girl who looked like uncooked bread. At the top of the all-time list of paintings. [Bridge]. Mona Lisa, I got to know. Where the fuck are your eyebrows, I really wanna know. You could land a helicopter on that big potato forehead. Get this chick some Rogaine. You a bloated corpse, girl. [Chorus 3]. I'm an American man, this is my native land. Where no one lies about paintings. But that's not the case in France. Where the naked ladies dance. and they look like Dennis Franz. You're so mangy, Mona. Hair part wider than a country road. Unless you count cats, she died alone-a. The Mona Lisa sucks, la da da da da"

boombox,"[The Lonely Island]. Imagine in your mind a posh country club. The stuffy old money. Where the poor get snubbed. The spread is bland, sauerkraut and boiled goose. There's no way these people, will ever cut loose. But then I walk in the room. Hold my boombox high. And what happened next, will blow your mind!. [Julian Casablancas]. Everything got out of control. The music was so entrancing. Everyone got out on the floor. It was a bunch of old white people dancing. [The Lonely Island]. Now picture if you will a bunch of business men. Stuffed in the boardroom. Like pigs in a pen. The ties around their necks are. Like a hangman's noose. In the middle of the table there's a boiled goose. The old people smell makes you want to puke in the sink. These dudes'll never dance - yeah that's what you think!. I stride in the room all young and hip. Hold up my boombox, and say ""Listen to this!"". [Julian Casablancas]. Then everyone started to move. People rejoiced instead of financing. Your preconcieved notions were shattered. By the super old white people dancing. [The Lonely Island]. The Big Apple, where people never dance. Spirits go down while profits expand. The cops or the dealers, who's got the juice. The street venders peddling their boiled goose. So many types of people, they'll never get along. Till I bust out my boombox and play this song. [Julian Casablancas]. The music washed away all the hate. And society started advancing. Every demographic was represented. It was a rainbow coalition of dancing. WHOAHHH-ohh-OHH!. Everyone was wearing fingerless gloves. WHOAHHH-ohh-OHH!. I saw a Spanish guy doing the Bartman. [The Lonely Island]. Transport now to an old folks home. Where the elderly are tossed on their brittle bones. The orderlies are stealing, there's no excuse. Everyday for lunch they eat boiled goose. So I grabbed my boombox. And hit the turbo bass. And what happened next, was a total disgrace. [Julian Casablancas]. Everybody started having sex. The music was way too powerful. A bunch of old people fucking like rabbits. It was disgusting to say the least - OHHH!. A boombox can change the world. But you gotta know your limits with a boombox. This was a cautionary tale. A boombox is not a toy!!!"

And do the creep (haaaa). And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). I was six years old when I started creeping. My parents took it to their room and I started peeping. Can you imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads. And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed. And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born. Get popping out of momma like some chemical(?). And the doctor saw my head and he starting freaking. Cause I came clean and I came out creeping. [Nicki Minaj]. When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys locker room. Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room. As they dis-robed I was oogling and oggling. Little did they know that for me they was modelling. And I would laugh ha ha ha ha ha haha. And they would dance la la la la lalala-laaa. So pop pop pop your peepers and turn out your sneakers. Don't sleep, come and get ya creep on with me. Go get ya sweating off ya bride at her wedding. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). [Nicki Minaj]. But when you sneek into a wake and. You see a beefcake. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). When the judge is a hottie and you can't control ya body. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [Nicki Minaj]. So get ya knees flexin' and your arms T-rexin'. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [John Waters]. And don't forget to smile."

i'm so humble (feat. adam levine),"Watch out, watch out. It's Connor!. I've got it all and I'm gettin' more. But I never fall, beat 'em all. Cause you know I'm so humble.

Bar none, I am the most humble-est. Number one at the top of the humble list. My apple crumble is by far the most crumble-est. But I act like it tastes bad outta humbleness. The thing about me that's so impressive. Is how infrequently I mention all of my successes. I poo-poo it when girls say that I should model. My belly's full from all the pride I swallow. I'm the most courteous-bittable, hospitable. Reverential, normal-ary Arnold Schwarzen-orgarary. I hate compliments, put 'em in the mortuary. I'm so ordinary that it's truly quite extraordinary. It's not a competition, but I'm winnin. You won't hear me admit it. Because I'm so timid and submissive. I treat fat people like they were thin. Talk simple for the dumbos. I'm so humble. I'm not your normal definition of a rock star. I don't complain when my private jet is subpar. Ya mom's old, but I'll ask if she's your sister. People say I'm charming, but I beg to differ. I feel more humble than Dikembe Mutombo. After a stumble left him covered in a big pot o' gumbo. I guess in a way, bein' gracious is my weakness. People say I'm so unpretentious for a genius. I've got it all and I'm gettin' more. But I never fall, beat 'em all. Cause you know I'm so humble. I say that with no ego. I'm so humble. It's just good manners. They say I'm a ten, but I'm an eight at best. Plus two, says you. Not me, cause I'm so humble. Mama raised me right. I'm so humble, I'm so humble. Watch out, watch out"

boombox,"[The Lonely Island]. Imagine in your mind a posh country club. The stuffy old money. Where the poor get snubbed. The spread is bland, sauerkraut and boiled goose. There's no way these people, will ever cut loose. But then I walk in the room. Hold my boombox high. And what happened next, will blow your mind!. [Julian Casablancas]. Everything got out of control. The music was so entrancing. Everyone got out on the floor. It was a bunch of old white people dancing. [The Lonely Island]. Now picture if you will a bunch of business men. Stuffed in the boardroom. Like pigs in a pen. The ties around their necks are. Like a hangman's noose. In the middle of the table there's a boiled goose. The old people smell makes you want to puke in the sink. These dudes'll never dance - yeah that's what you think!. I stride in the room all young and hip. Hold up my boombox, and say ""Listen to this!"". [Julian Casablancas]. Then everyone started to move. People rejoiced instead of financing. Your preconcieved notions were shattered. By the super old white people dancing. [The Lonely Island]. The Big Apple, where people never dance. Spirits go down while profits expand. The cops or the dealers, who's got the juice. The street venders peddling their boiled goose. So many types of people, they'll never get along. Till I bust out my boombox and play this song. [Julian Casablancas]. The music washed away all the hate. And society started advancing. Every demographic was represented. It was a rainbow coalition of dancing. WHOAHHH-ohh-OHH!. Everyone was wearing fingerless gloves. WHOAHHH-ohh-OHH!. I saw a Spanish guy doing the Bartman. [The Lonely Island]. Transport now to an old folks home. Where the elderly are tossed on their brittle bones. The orderlies are stealing, there's no excuse. Everyday for lunch they eat boiled goose. So I grabbed my boombox. And hit the turbo bass. And what happened next, was a total disgrace. [Julian Casablancas]. Everybody started having sex. The music was way too powerful. A bunch of old people fucking like rabbits. It was disgusting to say the least - OHHH!. A boombox can change the world. But you gotta know your limits with a boombox. This was a cautionary tale. A boombox is not a toy!!!"

finest girl (bin laden song),"Finest girl I ever met in my whole life. Wanted to take her home, make her my wife. Knew she was a freak when she started talking.

She wanted to fuck me harder then the Us government. Fucked Bin Laden. She was a freaky kind of girl. Kept up with current events from all around the world. More specifically one event. The time Osama Bin Laden got shot in the head. She said ""Do me like that"". But I couldn't track the metaphor. That said I can see you horny like a stegasaur. That said again your request is so irregular. She put on a beard, I started looking at the exit door. Then a turban. Then a tunic. She said ""Invade my cave with your special unit"". I said ""He wasn't in a cave"", but there was no stopping. She demanded that I fuck her like we. Fucked Bin Laden. Fuck Bin Laden. Fuck Bin Laden. She wanted to fuck me harder then the Us government. Fucked Bin Laden. This girl requested intercourse to bring her to climax. With the clinical efficiency of the assassination of Bin Laden. You're harboring a fugitive (That ass). My justice will be punitive (Imma smash). Night-vision, they can see us through my go-pro. She tried to negotiate, I said thats a no-no. Now I'm creeping in her bed room like go-go.

She said ""Now you've finished me off, throw my body in the ocean"". I yell ""Geronimo"" and took some pictures for posting. The President called, he said ""Congratulations Connor"". I said ""Mr. President to what do I owe this honor? "". He said ""Come give me the deets in the White House Garden, I gots to know how you fucked her like we. Fucked Bin Laden"". Fuck Bin Laden.

A girl let me do it, it literally just happened. Having sex should make a nice man out the meanest. (Jorma Taccone). Never guess where I just came from, I had sex. If I had to describe the feelin', it was the best. When I had the sex, man, my penis felt great. And I called my parents right after I was done. (Samberg). Oh, hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did?. Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest. (Was sure nice of her to let you do that thing). Nice of any girl ever (Now sing). I just had sex (Ay). And it felt so good (Felt so good). A woman let me put my penis inside of her (Her). I wanna tell the world. To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it. (Doesn't really make sense) But man, screw it. (I ain't one to argue with a good thing). She could be my wife!. (That good?). The best thirty seconds of my life. I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her. Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure. With that in mind, a soft, nice-smellin' girl's better. Plus she let me wear my chain. And my turtleneck sweaters. So this one's dedicated to them girls. That let us flop around on top of them. If you're near or far, whether short or tall. We wanna thank you all for lettin' us fuck you. She kept lookin' at her watch (Doesn't matter, had sex!). But I cried the whole time (Doesn't matter, had sex!). I think she might've been a racist (Doesn't matter, had sex!). She put a bag on my head (Still counts!). I just had sex (Ay). And my dreams came true. (Dreams came true). So if you had sex in the last thirty minutes. Then you qualified to sing with me. I just had se-eeee-ex (Everybody sing!). And it felt so good (We all had sex! ). A woman let me put my penis inside of her. I just had se-ay-eeee-ex (I just had sex). And I'll never go back (Never go back). To the not-havin'-seeex ways of the past"

Cause we're three white douchebags in Japan (That's us!). It's all part of our master plan. To get some much needed R&R. At the expense of Universal Records. Wow Look at all this Japanese money.

My heart stood still so did time and space. Never felt that I could feel real again. But the look in her eyes said I need a friend. She turned to me that's when she said it. Looked me dead in the face, asked ""Cash or Credit?"". And I. JIZZED IN MY PANTS. It's perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me. But we're going to need a clean up on aisle 3. And now I'm posed in an awkward stance because I. JIZZED IN MY PANTS. To be fair you were flirting a lot. plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot. please stop acting like you're not impressed. One more thing, I'm gonna pay by check. Last week - I saw a film.

mona lisa,"[Intro]. What's up y'all? This is Conner4real. You know I've been all around the world, right?. But tonight I'm on my dumb shit. [Verse 1]. I'm headed to Paris at a quarter to noon. So excited to see her, I went straight to the Louvre. I heard she's exquisite, so I bought my ticket. Pushed my way to the front of the crowd. And I couldn't believe what I saw. [Chorus 1]. Mona Lisa, you're an overrated piece of shit. With your terrible style and your dead shark eyes. And your smirk like you're hiding a dick. What the fuck is this garbage?. Mona Lisa, the original basic bitch. Traveled thousands of miles to see your beautiful smile. Talk about a bait and switch, you ugly. [Verse 2]. I'm headed to Cairo to see the pyramids. But what did I find there? A dirty pile of bricks. There was trash all over and a very foul odor. The smell was out of a camel's ass. But even that wasn't as bad as. [Chorus 2]. Mona Lisa, you're worse than the pyramids. Can someone explain why the whole wide world. Is obsessed with a Garbage Pail Kid. Looks like a Garbage Pail Kid. And Davinci must have sucked an art historian's dick. To get this girl who looked like uncooked bread. At the top of the all-time list of paintings. [Bridge]. Mona Lisa, I got to know. Where the fuck are your eyebrows, I really wanna know. You could land a helicopter on that big potato forehead. Get this chick some Rogaine. You a bloated corpse, girl. [Chorus 3]. I'm an American man, this is my native land. Where no one lies about paintings. But that's not the case in France. Where the naked ladies dance. and they look like Dennis Franz. You're so mangy, Mona. Hair part wider than a country road. Unless you count cats, she died alone-a. The Mona Lisa sucks, la da da da da"

I'll punch you in the jeans. I'll punch you in the jeans. This is not a case of man vs machine. You think that you're safe, thought you got away clean?. I'll roll up on you smooth and punch you in the jeans. I got my fists clenched, gonna throw a haymaka. Rockin your slacks from here to jaimaica. Shake in your boots, cuz I'm the earthquaka. Bringin those jeans round here was a mistaka. I gotta vendetta, it's against your jeans (yeah). Gonna put my knuckles up against the seams. They can be on your legs or on the clothesline. But when I see the zipper and cloth, it's go time!. And I'm zeroed in, I got the tunnel vision. Gonna cover you in shit like a ton of pigeons. Man I hate your jeans, I'm gonna bruise that denim. It really doesn't matter as long as you're in em'. Yo we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before. Best believe this is not a metaphor. Better watch your back, cuz we're on the creep. And we won't stop till your jeans are six feet deep!. Man I'll murder your jeans, I'll feed em to the fishes. Heres what I'd do, if I had three wishes. Punch your jeans, on all three counts. It would bring me satisfaction in large amounts. If I had three wishes I would do the same. We see eye to eye in this jean punch game. I'd lay em in a field, where there's chemical sprayin. But I'd punch em first, yo that goes without sayin (yeah). Acid wash pleats or a nifty cuff. It's just another jean for my fist to stuff. Throwin fistacuffs, eat pants like bag lunches.

rocky,"[andy samberg]. Here's a little story that I think you'll like. It's not about shaq or iron mike. So buckle your seat belts it's gonna get choppy. And listen to the tale of the time I fought rocky. One day me and all my friends were hangin'. Talkin' 'bout which of the girls was most bangin'. Then one friend says ""you know who's really tough?. Rocky"" (hit me holmes) the boxer, maaan. I said ""yeah I know what about him?"" he said. ""he's really tough"". No way man, I'm callin' your bluff. I think that I could take him and to prove my point. I'll challenge him in public (hit me holmes). Yeah that's the joint. So the very next day stay true to my word. And I snuck on tv, so I could be heard. I said ""rocky if you're out there I think you're a nerd,. And I'll lick you and bury you like a dog turd"". I got kicked out but the candle was lit. Cause the people had to know if my claim was legit. It made the headlines then I got the call. It was rocky (hey) and he wanted to brawl. We negotiated terms, and set the date. Then I went into training to add some muscle weight. While I punched on meat in a rickety shack. He was sippin' on wine and havin' models rub his back. At the weigh-in, boy the tension was high. Me and rock toe to toe and eye to eye. I talked some trash we got pulled apart. I shot him one last look to strike fear in his heart. Skip ahead, the big night is finally here. My body was ripped and my mind was clear. We entered the arena to the roar of the crowd. People chanting my name, I never felt so proud. Faced off once more in the center of the ring. Touch gloves, said a prayer, then the bell went (ding). He hit me with a left and shattered my face. And a right sent my teeth all over the place. Then another great punch caved in my eye socket. He broke my jaw and my trainer yelled ""stop it!"". But nobody heard him and he crushed my ribs. Blood sprayed off my face and onto some kids. They yelled out ""more!"" and rocky obliged. I had to think of some way to turn the tides. So I leaned back to hit him with all of my might. Took a swing but he caught me with a sucker-punch right. Then a sucker-punch left and a sucker-punch right. Then twenty-two consecutive sucker-punch rights. He tore off my arms and beat me with 'em. Then threw acid in my face which obscured my vision. He kicked me in the leg and fractured my shin. The bone splinter shot right out of my skin. People barfed in the crowd, they were going insane!. Then rocky punched my nose bone into my brain. I was quivering and twitching when I soiled my shorts. Then rocky pissed on me, customary in sports. The doctor came out and pronounced me dead. And that was the night I fought rocky"
santana dvx,"What is that, Cristal?. No!. Dom P?. Hell no! This is that Carlos Santana champagne!. Oh shit, Santana DVX? That's my joint!. Mine too but a lot of these busters don't know about it.. Well, let's tell these motherfuckers!. As a kid, I used to lay awake and think. When was Santana gonna make a drink?. But now I'm all grown and my dream came true. Santana champagne, from him to you. From the heart of Napa Valley and the guitar king. Comes the sparkling wine to make a blind man sing. Yo it's the champagne, from the man with the bandana. I can't stand a flute with anything but Santana. What's the first name in champ? It's Carlos. And to that man, I propose a toast. In the sixties he had lots of freebie sex. Now he's gettin' down with the DVX. Excuse me, fellas, am I to understand that Carlos Santana has made a champagne?. That's right, motherfucker! Here, try it.. Alright. Awwwwwwwwww shit!. I feel alive for the first time. Each sip hits my lips like a landmine. Without Carlos in my life, I was living a lie. He makes his guitar weep, but his champagne cry. He's a southwest, tie wearing bolo champ. Comin' straight out the box with a bowl o'champ. Yo he's a beast with the sugar and yeast. Mixed in a pot. Like the way his releases mix jazz, blues, and pop. And the source of fusion. He's lady's shoe producin'. [ The Lonely Island Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]. Plus he teamed with Rob Thomas for a music revolution. On the seventh day it's been said God rests. But on the eighth day he made the DVX!. Gentlemen, gentlemen what is all the hub-bub about?. Carlos Santana?!. That's right, I see you bitches is enjoying my sparkling wine.. We certainly are.. Well be careful because this shit will get you fucked up!. (Bitch!). I'm like no other, one of a kind, my sparkling wine. Santana DVX make you wanna have sex. I'm rich bitch, I'm having my chips. Get laid all the time, by seventies chicks. Won hella Grammys, bitches throw me their panties. I'm probably your daddy, I probably nutted in your mammy. I'm a Bay boy, city life, been around the corner. Try to play me foul and my vipers gon' run up on ya. A legend, a boss, that's what I are. Accidental pimp, trying to be killin' the guitar. Old enough to know better, but young enough to not care. I get actin', might slap a bitch with my hair. Left coast, up top, I bang that shit. My sparkling wine'll pop Cristal on her lip. Can't stop, won't stop getting my bread. Packed arenas and coliseums, now watch me shred. Oh Carlos Santana!. A monkey drank a bottle and learned to speak. A squid drank a bottle and became a freak. A lion drank a bottle and forgot how to growl. A horse drank a bottle, and fucked a cow"
sax man,"Well, he was the Sax Man from the state of Tennessee. First set in with the band at the ripe old age of three, weeks old. And when he blew into that horn all the people gathered 'round.

[Verse 3]. It's right under your nose, semicolon: mouth. Opposite of north, semicolon: south. Right over your home, semicolon: attic. Hooked on semicolons, semicolon: addict. [Hook 3: Solange]. We got the game on lock: toy chest. You're too big for your clothes: boys vest. You know we out of control: no brakes. Your birthday party sucked: no cakes. [Breakdown: Solange]. When it comes to punctuation. You know we're number one. And to the people of every nation. Feel the power of the semicolon. [Outro: The Lonely Island and Maya Rudolph]. Semicolons. We rest our case. No actually those are examples of colons. You all get F's. Wait, what?"
should i move (feat. akon),"Decisions. This was the hardest day of my life. Should I stay or should I go?. Help me, lord, to decide. Three blocks from home. When she caught my eye. I shouldn't even be looking. But she just had to be mine. Ten bedrooms, ten baths. 7, 000 Square feet. I was week in the knees. She was the house of my dreams. I had just moved in. To the place down the block. And now I'm thinking 'bout moving?. Imagine my shock. I talked to my real estate guy, peter. He was like. Your house is beautiful, yo. How could you leave her?. 6, 000 Square feet. A dolphin-themed pool. If I'm being honest, connor, yo. I think you're a fool. But it's cool. You can definitely afford both places. Tell me what to do, god. My heart's torn in pieces. So many options. And all in my price range. This decision is torture. My head's playing mind games. Should I move?. (should I move y'all?). Tell me should I buy this new place?. (tell me should I buy it?). Should I move y'all? (with my money). It'd be nice to have some more space. (more space). So I turned to my friends. Playing out by the pool. As I sipped on my drink. I screamed what should I do?. They just shrugged. And I could tell that I was on my own. With this decision, no vision. Which house to call my home. I had to get away. So I flew to majorca. Dove in the ocean. Went swimming with dorphins. I drank too many piña coladas. And fell asleep. Had a dream about both houses. And began to weep. Tell me how houses. Can one man own?. I'll be paying in cash. Got no need for a loan (but still). Should I move?. (should I move?). Tell me should I buy this new place?. (I don't know what to do). Should I move y'all?. (I think I should just buy it). It'd be nice to have some more space. (I think I'm gon' buy it). So much pain, so many struggles. But I made it through. I bought the house, it's beautiful. And I kept the old one for my dogs. Sometimes it just works out. (shit works out). Peace. Oh, and now I own two houses, oh"

Pop your knees up and down sh-sh-shakin' your neck. Now pull your waistband up like you expecting a flood. And stick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud. Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers. Put this in your speakers, you a certified creeper. When you see a country bitch laying out at the beach. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). I was six years old when I started creeping. My parents took it to their room and I started peeping. Can you imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads. And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed. And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born. Get popping out of momma like some chemical(?). And the doctor saw my head and he starting freaking. Cause I came clean and I came out creeping. [Nicki Minaj]. When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys locker room. Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room. As they dis-robed I was oogling and oggling. Little did they know that for me they was modelling. And I would laugh ha ha ha ha ha haha. And they would dance la la la la lalala-laaa. So pop pop pop your peepers and turn out your sneakers. Don't sleep, come and get ya creep on with me. Go get ya sweating off ya bride at her wedding. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaaa). [Nicki Minaj]. But when you sneek into a wake and. You see a beefcake. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). When the judge is a hottie and you can't control ya body. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [Nicki Minaj]. So get ya knees flexin' and your arms T-rexin'. Do the creep (haaaa). And do the creep (haaa). [John Waters]. And don't forget to smile."

yolo (feat. adam levine & kendrick lamar),"(YOLO) YOLO, you only live once. The battle cry of a generation. This life is a precious gift. So don't get too crazy. It's not worth the risk. You know that we are still young. So don't be dumb. Don't trust anyone. Cause you only live once. Ugh, you only live once. Thats the motto. So take a chill pill. Ease off the throttle. Never go to loud clubs. Cause it's bad for your ears. Your friends will all be sorry. When they can't hear. And stay the hell away from drugs. Cause they're not legal. Then bury all your money in the backyard. Like a beagle. Cause you should never trust a bank. They've been known to fail. And never travel by car, a bus. Boat or by rail. And don't travel by plane. And don't travel at all. Built a bomb shelter basement. With titanium walls. And wear titanium suits. In case pianos fall on ya. And never go in saunas. Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas. And never take the stairs. Cause they're oftenl unsafe. You only live once. Don't let it go to waste. You know that we are still young. So hold off on the fun. Cook your meat 'til it's done. Cause you only live once. Yeah. And here's another piece of advice:. Stay away from kids. Cause their hair is filled with mad lice. There's no such thing. As too much Purell. This a cautionary tale. Word to George Orwell. So don't 1980-force. Any plugs into sockets. Always wear a chastity belt. And triple lock it. Then hire a taster. Make him check your food for poison. And if you think your mailman is a spy. Then destroy him. No blankets or pajamas. They can kill you in your sleep. Two words about furniture:. Killing machines. Board your windows up. The sun is bad for your health. And always wear a straight jacket. So your safe from yourself. Take no chances (no chances). Stop freelancin' (right now). Invest in your future. Don't dilute your finances (uh huh). 401K, make sure it's low risk. Then get some real estate (how much?). 4.2% Thirty year mortgage. That's important, that's a great deal. And if you can't afford it. Don't forge it on your last bill. Renting is for suckers right now. A dependable savings. And you'll retire with money in your account. Beast.. YOLO, say no no. Isolate yourself. And just roll solo. Be care-folo. You oughta look out. Also stands for YOLO. You know that we are still young. Burn the prints off your thumbs. Then pull out all your teeth. So you can't bite your tongue. Only on this earth for a short time, time. So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die. Just take our advice and hide. And scream YOLO to the sky. You oughta look out"
