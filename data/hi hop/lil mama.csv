broken pieces,[Chorus:]. In the mirror I'm lookin at the shadow. If I bash her I'll probably would just shatter. Broken pieces that represent my heart. Broken pieces keep fallin from my heart. In the mirror I'm lookin at the shadow. If I bash her I'll probably would just shatter. Broken pieces that represent my mind. Broken pieces keep fallin from my heart. Cause I kno wat I'm feeling. And I kno wat is real. Broken pieces that represent my heart. Broken pieces keep fallin from my heart. [Verse 1:]. Everyday when I wake up. I wanna see yo face and I. Realize that you'll never apologize. For yo lies and all the ways you hurt me. And I kno in my mind that you ain't worthy. But when I look in the mirror. I see this girl who keeps cryin she's cryin. She still in love with you. But I tell not to cause she's wildin she's wildin. I don't kno wat she's thinkin about. Get it together or I'm gettin you out. Of the mirror. I'm gettin you outta my system. My vision premonition. And I listen to my answers. And free my soul from prison. [Chorus]. [Verse 2:]. My patience a plastic bag. And he kept fillin it. Carryin baggage of others. Is where I emptied it. Played the fool before. I'm not about to let you enter. My mind for my heart draws the bigger picture. His presence embrace me. His lovin so greatly. I miss the way we. Use to sit up all night. And talk about nothin. On the phone. Please how could you be so weak. When you kno u deserve so much better. And rather than settle for less. Jus let the best play catch up. When the time is right they'll find you. If you choose to. Do not do. The best I could do. Is warn and inform you. The mirror. [Chorus]
college (feat. yirayah),[Talkin:]. Now that I think about it. I was always takin away from my father. Or he was always takin away from me. It's probably why we so close now. Ya kno. [Chorus:]. We been starvin so long in these crazy ghetto streets. And they say we're so wrong for the way we try to eat. How long will he struggle. I gotta grind jus to eat now. I gotta eat jus a lil now. So I gotta live my life this way. [Verse 1:]. I stretched and yawned. 4 years from a newborn. On a charter bus. Filled with stranged humans. Besides my mother nobody seems anxious. Though we on our way to visit a college campus. We roll up freshen up at a food concession. Can't talk to strangers. I wanna ask em questions. Saw a woman cryin. Boy face the fence. I don't wanna go to college. If it causes this. Back on the bus still analyzin vibes. Turned to my moms excel asked her. 'why you cryin? '. She said because I'm happy. But I could tell she lyin. And since lyin was a curse. I sense storytellin. Her eyes focused on a object long enough they tingle. That's when she reached into her bag because her phone was ringin. She said 'I accept'. I'm still puzzle piecin. I knew my pops was on the other line. Lonely singin. [Chorus]. [Verse 2:]. Soon after we roll up to these gates. Barbed wired up. Men standin in the entrance armed up. With a close eye on us. We enter the buildin. Got checked by the women who starin. My mother. Pull out a card with a picture of her face on it. Two papers with our names on it. They identify her. They lookin at me. Me my confusion of the journey. Thorugh these walls we go. Before the next one opens. The past one must close. As they check for proper clothes. My mama so prepared. For this mini battle has chose. Finally we reach our final destination. My poppa placed in a seat. Facin me. No women in his class. Jus men who never laugh. And when they see they family. They sing. [Chorus]. [Verse 3:]. So I begin my investigation. My elbow on the round table. My palm at chin. I'm lookin at him. Ask questions like. 'how you been? '. 'when you graduatin? '. Time was up got pulled away. Kickin and screamin. Tears came to his eyes. But never fell in front me. Got old enough to realize. Must've fell up under me. Bein locked away in prison from your family. Tryin to find ways for us to eat. I see. [Chorus]
emotional rollercoasters (skit),"[Spoken:]. Well there's many girls of my age group. Come out of their teenage years. And going into womanhood. Becoming a young lady and they go threw. Different like... emotional rollercoasters. And when you on a rollercoaster. Like in regular life you can't get off. In the middle of the ride. You gotta ride it out until it stops. And at the end of that ride. It feel like that rollercoaster was fun. Even though it might had a couple of. Twirls, Spins and Drops that made you cry"

But I like his style & his whipp is mean. My mama told me to find a man to take care. Of me & he does buy me things but he beats on me. I come to her for a little advice. So I show up with a black eye. Telling me to know my place so I stay. Waiting for my body phase. Telling myself it just a little pregnancy phase. When all in reality I'm being discourage & disrespected. And under the pressure & I don't really blame the man. I blame my mother for not teaching me the different types of man. Life could never understand my side of story being that it's so consist 18 years. And 9 months developing raised in a prison I guess_I'll never make a difference. [CHORUS]. Born on to another is the least. Of my problems. Parents like deja vu. My stomach is starving. 3 months pregnant idiotically I departed. So ashame of a life that was started. I ask god if he can take the pain away. He made me in denial of every word I pray. Every day it's the same old no talent I' feeling like. My life is unbalanced no telling what tomorrow going look. Like yea right wrapped up in a fast light for a sudicial. Act why is my life set up for a failure I can care. Less with the people say to ya'll we break out. In rage venting all the hurt inside who am I. To tell you what you fail to realize the voice that you hold. Within you the voice that you are. The Voice Of The Young People!. [CHORUS]"

Done came this far, so might as well face it. Out my windshield, trying to see the end of the path. Through of my mind,still remember the past. When those who here were ridin' behind me. Young in the mind,like what's a hutle?. Triceps weak like, whats a muscle?. Never too young to experience struggle. When my block knew my best cause I always hugged you. And now in the present making diverse change. Influence how you taking know that I got brains. In consideration, coulda lost my mind but I'm still sane. And that only time can tell what the future brings. Cause he..... He lifts me up. He shows me what my purpose was. So I never let go. He lifts me up. He shows me what my purpose was.
