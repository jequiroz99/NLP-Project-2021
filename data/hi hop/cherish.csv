whenever,[Verse 1]. We were sittin' at the table.. We were talkin' bout some thangs.. Conversatin' on what's been goin' on lately.. He moved in a little further.. Said baby come a little closer..

And I don't know what I would. do, If I couldn't make love to you. Over and Over and Over I wish that I. could live this moment in time. [Verse 2]. There were times of day I put my life completely in your arms. And if you should feel I could do more to please you. Then baby tell me how oh oh. Baby I can't breathe when you touch my body. When your heart beats its like music to me. And I can't see my life without you. Baby it's all up to you. [Chorus]. If I could make time stand still. Then I know we can live this moment for ever.

cupid's chokehold,"Ba ba da da. Ba ba da da. Ba ba da da. Ba ba da da. Ba ba da da. Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one i got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). It's been some time since we last spoke. This is gonna sound like a bad joke. But momma i fell in love again. It's safe to say i have a new girlfriend. And i know it sounds so old. But cupid got me in a chokehold. And i'm afraid i might give in. Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'. I mean she even cooks me pancakes. And alka seltzer when my tummy aches. If that ain't love then i don't know what love is. We even got a secret handshake. And she loves the music that my band makes. I know i'm young but if i had to choose her or the sun. I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun. (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one i got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one i got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). It's been awhile since we talked last and i'm tryin' hard not to talk fast. But dad i'm finally thinkin' i may have found the one. Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son. And i know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long. But i promise this is on a whole new plane. I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da). I love the way she calls my phone. She even got her very own ringtone. If that ain't love then i don't know what love is (ba ba da da). It's gonna be a long drive home but i know as soon as i arrive home. And i open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor. She'll be back in my arms into my arms once more for sure. Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one i got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend. I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da). She's got a smile that would make the most senile. Annoying old man bite his tongue. I'm not done. She's got eyes comparable to sunrise. And it doesn't stop there. Man i swear. She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten. And now she's even got her own song. But movin' on. She's got the cutest laugh i ever heard. And we can be on the phone for three hours. Not sayin' one word. And i would still cherish every moment. And when i start to build my future she's the main component. Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but. Everywhere i go i keep her picture in my wallet like you. Take a look at my girlfriend. She's the only one i got (ba ba da da). Not much of a girlfriend.

stop calling me,"[Verse 1]. When I first met you I could tell you were trouble right from the start.. I walked past you turned your head.. While your girlfriend was standing there.. Gave you my number just cuz I was in a hurry, that's when it all began.. Damn how'd you become my man.. What am I to do.. You telling everybody that I'm your boo.. Ooh that ain't cool.. Why can't see I'm not felling you.. Even if I threw a hint you.. Know girls just like attention.. But they don't like when you keep calling and calling and calling.. [Chorus]. I can't take what you doing to me.. Boy why is it so hard for you to see.. If you keep calling trying to holla.. There's no need.. To keep calling me, so stop calling me.. You be calling 3 and 4 times in a row.. If you can't reach me on my cell.. You call my home.. How many times do I have to let you know, to stop calling me.. Boy quit calling me, quit calling me.. [Verse 2]. Now it's getting ridiculous and I'm about to lose my mind.. Cuz when I changed my number.. You called and got it from my Mama.. Ooh now you tripping boo.. Why hold on when I don't want you.. You find another girl who'll love to put up with you.. What am I to do.. You telling everybody that I'm your boo.. Ooh that ain't cool.. Why can't you see I'm not felling you.. It was not your swagger.. Not your game that doesn't bother me.. But it does when you keep calling me, calling me.. [Chorus]"
