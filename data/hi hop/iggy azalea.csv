runway,"(Chorus). Put everything in a suitcase one day. And run away to the runway. To find somewhere to lay my heart, lay my heart. If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going. To find somewhere to lay my heart. Home's wherever I lay my heart. (Verse: Iggy Azalea). You ever start to feel that home wasn't your home. Kinda like somebody made you wear the wrong clothes. What you say ain't gotta be what you made of. Well see your heart don't always match where you came from. Couldn't see you so they treat you like a misfit. Because your mind clicks in another district. Call you favor they don't know what's inside you. 'Cause what's inside justifies what divides you. Searching for that place right where you wanna be. That's really real where it's never full capacity. Roll back and get away, never come back never runaway. (Chorus). Put everything in a suitcase one day. And run away to the runway. To find somewhere to lay my heart,. Home's wherever I lay my heart. If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going. To find somewhere to lay my heart. Home's wherever I lay my heart. (Verse: Pusha T). They say home's where you hang your hat. So beware of the owner 'cause he bang his gap. And in that shit I push and I clean my set. All over the globe via I rap. And it still ain't enough for the haters. Put on for my city, light it up like it's Vegas. How you frontin' on I lead I'm the greatest. Flow like a butterfly, the porsche ride amazing. I feel like speedracer. My jello's in the Louie Duffle. MCM hold the finna' buckle. Paw, that's what I call an interracial couple. A long whip poppin' tans, that's a power struggle. (Chorus). Put everything in a suitcase one day. And run away to the runway. To find somewhere to lay my heart,. Home's wherever I lay my heart. If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going. To find somewhere to lay my heart. Home's wherever I lay my heart. (Verse: Iggy Azalea). Change my lounge too, and my lattitude. To get an attitude, the shit granted too. But my mind's gone until my fine home. Then I can get my shine on no rice stones. Then I can get my shine on no rice stones. See you later with my bigz, I'm gone. (Chorus). Put everything in a suitcase one day. And run away to the runway. To find somewhere to lay my heart,. Home's wherever I lay my heart. If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going.

don't need ya'll,"I remember when it used to be simple. But all this cash it just complicates things. And all this money we into. It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder. Grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer. Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya. But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't going on. So I just keep pushing when. I'm being pulled in every direction. Now I'm popping so they watching. Every step of my progression. Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing. On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven. Dear Lord, if you hear me. I don't need not a new friend near me. Cause I don't want none of that fake love. Cause how I'm looking at it, all of that be made up. I remember when I wasn't this big. And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here. Oh now everybody wanna love me. Try to knock me down but I'm strong. I did all this on my own. Ain't got no time for no new friends. So for now just leave me alone. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all. Making each and every song like it might be my last one. But still making sure the cash come. Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none. Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some. That's when, I took time and I figured it out. I'd rather deal with the stressing more than living without. Take a one way trip to the top one time. Let you have it for a minute now I want mine. Same girl on the cover of the magazine. Was the one hiding pain that you hadn't seen. Talking 'bout. No money, no family. Sixteen in the middle of Miami. Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me. Now we talking 'bout VMA's and a Grammy. But in due time, turn nothing into something. So now I need money, put it all in my discussions. I remember when I wasn't this big. And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here. Oh now everybody wanna love me. Try to knock me down but I'm strong. I did all this on my own. Ain't got no time for no new friends. So for now just leave me alone. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all. And if you wasn't here when I was down. Then you won't be here when I'm up. Now the same one you looked over. Be the same one that blew up. Ain't it funny how this life thing works?. When you think it's finished is when it all begins. Go from doubts to having the thought it might work. It goes up and down then it starts again. When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye. But my how time flies by. When you on top of the world sky high. I remember when I wasn't this big. And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here. Oh now everybody wanna love me. Try to knock me down but I'm strong. I did all this on my own. Ain't got no time for no new friends. So for now just leave me alone. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway. I don't need y'all anyway.

glory,"[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]. I'm just tryin' to build my army up. But these days they shootin' at me with a tommy gun. Carry the weight 'cause I'm strong enough. But sometimes the hate, make me feel like. I'm pulling a Tonka truck. What's the fuss? I bought the murda bizness to all of them. They asking questions like I ain't talking about dressing. Are we talking about art, or are we talking about perception?. If it bangs play my record, if not, then shelf it. While others coming up shorter than elf limbs. I realize I may be the realest bitch they ever dealt with. And to be honest these rumours be all fables. See I don't get dropped; I drop the label. Let's keep it very clear, I'm doing just fine. I'm sitting on a million, your bank's flatline. Death to the haters, face it one time. You got your own dick bitch. Why you ridin' mine?. (Hook). Kick me down but I'm a champion. Heard them say that I'm not the one. Nevermind them, never-nevermind them. Nevermind them, never-nevermind them. Carry the weight like a champion. Go sell the dreams to the other ones. Nevermind them, never-nevermind them. Nevermind them, never-nevermind them. [Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]. I never learned to fail, all I know is win. The haters shoot me down, can't help but crash land. I get up walking, they still talking it never ends. They build me up to break me down it builds me up again. On my Twin Tower shit, even when I'm gone. They gon' pay to see where I've been. I ain't do this shit alone but it ain't take many friends. Now I understand the song, many men many men. It's only so long, fake bitches can't pretend. I'm gone with the wind, they can't even catch my drift. The hate keep you from hearing, well fuck it read my lips. There's some things I never do: never lose, never quit. Never change who I am, never give a fuck who gives a shit. I'm drunk off life, of course I'm swerving in and shit. I'm in the zone throne empty I'ma take a sit. And like my girl Tiny all these haters on my Tip. (Hook) x3. Kick me down but I'm a champion. Heard them say they can knock you off. Nevermind them, never nevermind them. Nevermind them, never nevermind them. Carry the weight like a champion. Go sell the dreams to the other ones. Nevermind them, never nevermind them. Nevermind them, never nevermind them"

Pressure make a diamond, that pressure make me a star. Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar. People always askin' me how I got this far. My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are. Now they call me Mrs. Money. Like I'm married to the mula. Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers. Glory, hallelujah, I'mma take that ass to church. I'mma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work. I feel like the sky is falling down. Ain't nobody here to play around.

But I'm guessing that plans fell through. Yeah, we fell off. I won't ask you to climb back. I paid twenty for that Rolly, I just want my time back. Was wrong too but I see it now. That you don't give a damn. I got you tatted, you took off. before the ink dried on my hands. I was down to give you the world, instead you gave me hell. I lied, tried to be perfect and I played myself. And it hurts so bad, we coulda worked on that. Cause you say you love me. but real love don't work like that. The truth is, I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you. And I tend to laugh and crack a smile. when things get painful. Said I crack a smile when things get painful. Remembering the moments when I used to date you. Rolex's don't tick-tock. But damn it baby, my time costs. And damn it baby, my time is money. So I need payback for all the time lost.

Cause I said we could work on it, you said. ""let's leave it behind"". Couldn't put together the picture I paint in my mind. So how I see you know insulting me is wasting my time. But we live and learn and learn and love and let go. Cause if we stay in this. then we might make it worse than before. Another hard lesson, stressing taking personal notes. Remember sweet nothings, like baby. what's the purpose in those?. Both of us saying it shouldn't have went like that. But sometimes in love, it just get like that. Used to think that when it went wrong we'd get right back. You know, Cupid's got another arrow, and shit like that. And for all of y'all watching I hope that this entertain you. And that you enjoyed this song that I sang you. Cause I'm still here laughing when it gets painful. Remembering the moments when I used to date you. Rolex's don't tick-tock.

runway,"(Chorus). Put everything in a suitcase one day. And run away to the runway. To find somewhere to lay my heart, lay my heart. If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going. To find somewhere to lay my heart. Home's wherever I lay my heart. (Verse: Iggy Azalea). You ever start to feel that home wasn't your home. Kinda like somebody made you wear the wrong clothes. What you say ain't gotta be what you made of. Well see your heart don't always match where you came from. Couldn't see you so they treat you like a misfit. Because your mind clicks in another district. Call you favor they don't know what's inside you. 'Cause what's inside justifies what divides you. Searching for that place right where you wanna be. That's really real where it's never full capacity. Roll back and get away, never come back never runaway. (Chorus). Put everything in a suitcase one day. And run away to the runway. To find somewhere to lay my heart,. Home's wherever I lay my heart. If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going. To find somewhere to lay my heart. Home's wherever I lay my heart. (Verse: Pusha T). They say home's where you hang your hat. So beware of the owner 'cause he bang his gap. And in that shit I push and I clean my set. All over the globe via I rap. And it still ain't enough for the haters. Put on for my city, light it up like it's Vegas. How you frontin' on I lead I'm the greatest. Flow like a butterfly, the porsche ride amazing. I feel like speedracer. My jello's in the Louie Duffle. MCM hold the finna' buckle. Paw, that's what I call an interracial couple. A long whip poppin' tans, that's a power struggle. (Chorus). Put everything in a suitcase one day. And run away to the runway. To find somewhere to lay my heart,. Home's wherever I lay my heart. If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going. To find somewhere to lay my heart. Home's wherever I lay my heart. (Verse: Iggy Azalea). Change my lounge too, and my lattitude. To get an attitude, the shit granted too. But my mind's gone until my fine home. Then I can get my shine on no rice stones. Then I can get my shine on no rice stones. See you later with my bigz, I'm gone. (Chorus). Put everything in a suitcase one day. And run away to the runway. To find somewhere to lay my heart,. Home's wherever I lay my heart. If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going. To find somewhere to lay my heart. Home's wherever I lay my heart"

Polo should have been my logo,. with a jockey around on my coat though. So I got to take 'em back to the drawing board. Cause it's time to make some hits for the mo'mo'. I turn up when my chalk missing, and hop out in a New Edition. I'm propane, this Hell's Kitchen,. my campfire, this smoke signals. Sold some other shit, get these maggots off me. The best is a immaculate, attach it slowly. Broads got at where you act, they acting Tony. Fuck you up in the ass, get the alimony, ugh. [Hook]. Should have known a thing. Should have known a thing about me. Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll. I'm a motherfucking G, and we long distance. Sipping on biscuits, sipping our tea. We flip them the bird, then let them fly on for free. Watchu lookin' at, Watchu lookin' at. Watchu lookin' at, Watchu lookin' at. [Verse 2]. I'm cooling in Italy. And a man could probably a tee, I'm making a scene. If they rolling the camera's, my candids come with a fee. Excuse my french, I speak deadly, bread throwing that cheddy. My pocket's nauseous, these ones is vomits,. I'm throwing up this confetti. Ugh, I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke. I'm gonna ride this wave kind of like a tube on the rope.

we in this bitch,"Right, Iggy back no playtime. I just gave y'all some break time to miss me. So stressed on what's next. My last little bit of success ain't even hit me. So keep it light on the advice. Look at us, we must be doing something right clearly. In convo I don't talk to too many. I just talk to the fans in the songs cause y'all feel me. Now let's reflect on what we left on New Classic. I overstepped what was expected, I blew past it. So best bet is respect my perspective. Or go get your sight checked for new glasses. The fact is you combine the stats with. The history I made, the message should be established. I guess what I'm explaining in laymen's. Is ain't nothin' about miss Azalea average.

Aas peers I be rhymin' with. But everything is so one-sided, divided and biased. That I can't get a fair judge panel not in the slightest bit. In light of this, I had to write a hit to get this type of chip. Ridin' dick won't get me nowhere and I ain't that type of chick. That's so unladylike 'specially knowin' they be like. ""Iggy this and Iggy that"" long as you say it, say it right. Right, they might be playin' but Iggy ain't. 'Til Iggy faint, I just wanna fill this Iggy bank. See I emerged from the smoke without a smudge on me. So back up up off of me. Unless you got some love for me, right. Even with my back against the wall. I still don't know fear and won't shed a tear. Cause when I think back, I've seen it all. And everything that ain't stopped me got me here so. Now we in this bitch.
