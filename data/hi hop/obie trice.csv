rap name,"[Obie Trice]. Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks. Rap; I been in it ever since I was invented. That's cuz a nigga live it. My records wield digits in history - niggaz you be the witness. I got the white boys mad at me. Cuz Em, signed another black boy like he nigga happy. Caucasians, Marshall knows talent. Obie Trice a riot, that's why he's hired. I hit ya raves, balloons and E's. and bang all your European Pamela Lee's. Fuckin aye, or how we say it round my way. ""Fo sho"", Trice gon' blow, then I'm off to them shows. I'm off across the globe, until my accounts all swoll. For young Kobe - big things, act like ya know me. Not a soul can hold me, I'm here. [Chorus]. That's why I ain't got no, (""rap name""). The name's (""Obie Trice""). (""They see me on the streets they be like 'Yo he nice!'""). So I came to the game (""real name, no gimmicks""). Rap my living... that's why I ain't got no, (""Rap Name""). The name's (""Obie Trice""). (""They see me on the streets they be like 'Yo he nice!'""). So I came to the game (""real name, no gimmicks""). Rap my living - that's why I ain't got no. [Obie Trice]. It didn't take much - one hot single (BAM!!). Smiles and handshakes my man. The industry greeted me with open arms. With no type of flak cuz O. Trice got that. Fugaze y'all rap, who gave y'all dat?. New wave of mu-zack that your all lovin. Got your broads on my balls huggin. Even my next-of-kin's famous (Obie's your cousin?!). Please believe it, I'm as ""Down to Earth"" as Chris Rock. gettin hit by trucks, starin at twat. A big cannon in ya G-spot. Me not arrogant girl, me keep them freaks hot. Whether or not you believe my status. I'm prepared to be the baddest on the rap that's happenin. Put the Mitten back on the map with Mathers and win this. [Chorus]. [Obie Trice]. Well I'm drunk right now, but still I got a gun. Beef? (*cocked and two shots*) best-a run. Cuz when I pop, people's flesh get numb. And whoa.. ya might not make it till ya young. The only one with okay's wanna blaze. Meet my little friends on racks in my den. Pull 'em out, that's when the action begins. And ya block, remind you of Mad Max the film. Deserted, that's word to vacant homes. 2002 Trice up in ya headphones. (*vocal scratch* - If it's ya system). Trice up in ya bows. (*vocal scratch* - If it's ya women). Then Trice up in ya hoes!. I suppose that I am kinda cocky, when it's dealin. with raps, chicks, and cats out to sock me. I handle it like Rocky, Jake Sneed. Rakim, Eric B. - O's a G!. [Chorus]. {*scratching*}. ""rap name"" ... ""rap name"" ... ""Obie Trice"". ""You can get stomped by Obie..."" <--- Eminem."

Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong. You put 'e' before the 'd' cuz that's all you on. You on Pac's dick, you a regular guy. If Pac was still alive you would never get by. All you do is cry, bitch keep it real. Life is more than imitating niggaz and eatin' pills. And kind of muthafucka ruins three deals. That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills. And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated. And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover cuz he need it. And all you niggaz hatin', shut you mouths. It's just that real niggaz ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out. [Obie Trice]. Do-ra-mi, but we don't sing muhfuckas'. So Murder Inc. do ya thing muhfuckas'. You've unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less. Than R&B comin' from that regime. Regime... It's a little extreme. Neck and necks with soldiers, muhfuckin' Marines. Ja sold his soul to sing. We've eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed. Now that you've embraced the green. Don't fuck with the triple beams. You's a muthafuckin actor slash Pac impersonatin' rapper. Slash Billie Holliday how it happen?. Artist for Repetuar saw him in action. Pac assassination Def Jam grabbed him. Told him reinact him, you go platinum.

We don't take you serious nigga you shook you half of a half-way crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga. And you can't replace the late greal one. And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one. Nigga please, stick to the script. before the guns stick to the clip, and Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch. Fuckin' old ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen. Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive. Wait a minute, hold on. Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?. A bitch made man, now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a tyrannasaurus rex?. You niggaz can scream holler and curse. Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta ya purse. (Proof). Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas. He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas. What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on. Put your ear to the ground for stucky and bush stones. What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz?. Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us. It's real business you ain't caught the concept. You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press. Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source. Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch. Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us. But Detroit niggaz ?? and ain't scurred to bust. (Kon Artis). Word to my nigga Bugs, punks like you get beat up. Stomped unconcious and smacked with the heater. This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina. Who's behind ya? Cadillic Pac or that transvestite who dress like a Lil Kim fox, her chest like a little windbox. press tight on the trigger of this glock. Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat. You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep. You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac. You 'Mockaveli', get your own identity. [Chorus]. [Eminem overdubs chorus]. Yeah!. Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again!. Fuckin' punk pussy little bitch!. I'll fuck you up boy!. Never! Never in your muthafuckin life!.

Brought gang squad aroud Oz. How could it be?. Been homies since superman draws. Only phoniness never came to par. He had us, a true neighborhood actor. Had His back with K's, now we see through him like x-rays. Cuffed in that Adam car, no matter his loss. We at 'em, it's war. Knowin not to cross those reservoir dogs.

Mean time, leanin in them European whips reclined up. It's eye for an eye the riders. We ain't trying to get locked up, we soul survivors. Po Po's is cowards, it's no you, it's ours. We vow this, mixing yayo with soda powder. Who woulda known he would fold and cower. Once the captain showed, he sold whole Mc Donalds. So it's no X and O's, tex calicodes. Aim at your chest nigga.

Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me. Even if we bubble slow, we get it eventually. No penitentiary, there'll be no clemency. You will meet the lord snitchin, given us a centuary. These cats is rats now, the streets need decon. Thats how they react now, weak, When the heat's on them. Stop snitchen, you asked for the life you live in. It's act is not permited, no where on the map. It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison. If you've been in it along with 'em. And then snitchen become hidden. So it's no X and O's, tex calicodes.

Just to give you the pleasure you request for. When I hit your spine that’s how you measure O. Tell your girlfriends you aint had it like this before. Now your girlfriends all up in the midst of O. Wanna be mistress, all cause a few extra inches. Blew back your interest, you lack experience, new jack my crew ran through that for instance. We can fuck from dust to dawn. No discussion who’s nuts your own. Shes in such of a rush to cum. Wanna choke on the dong, like it’s a bong. And what is it doing, your making a moan. You make her wanna leave that muthafucka she got back home. All Os knowing is he keeps hoes going, enjoying O Trice’s groin. [Nate Dogg (Chorus)]"

From Em to now what I'm deserving is slim (nah). Like Bme ain't as urgent as them. I murdered every verse you purchased? back then. Nuttin rehearsed no actin. No reenactments ""O"" so actually.

Nope I'm not Drake of course I'm not Weezy. I'm riding to K-Deezy. So why when? I see where the cheese be. You don't receive me Bme that's Obeezy (Bme). Don't it get it twisted like you. Internet niggas do Shady that's my birth. we'll always be crew (always). If we gotta take it back to Ja Rule. Back to Benzin? Hoe. We gone do what it do (4sho). Bullet in my head loose screw still. My motor skills had to get another boost real. I'm living proof that a death certificate's not a definite. Unless you the nigga got my roof peeled. Watch his head play peek a boo. Thru the scope on the pica-tinny rail ...Richard Harrow. Expires ya no face?. This a Broadway Empire ... Bme Believe you? me. I wanna crossover. The aroma of the hood take a hold of a soldier. Then it take toll and turn to a odor. When you can't get it off ya. The labels they don't want cha. But this ain't Degrassi this is where the grass be. Forty? four eight in weight and that's his last. Where mama titty rotten and she wear a mask. Just to be in public or around the people she lovin. They say I'm buggin when I'm buzzin.

average man,"[Verse 1]. Hey yo I'm focused, it's the locust. O. Trice is holdin the soldiers, the prognosis. Probably why I rose from zero to hope. Cause I was wide eyed and open nosed on my approach (nigga). Hold the toast you provoke. 44 Snub hugs my scrotum when I roll. Yes I hold my own. Swifty think you be boast clone, I'm aimin. Watch 'em switchin to Damons. And next Friday I can bet you's a changed man. When them thangs in hands, it's not a game man. I ghost ya, I bring ya much closer to Jehovah. Definition of a soldier, I told ya. I .. hold the toast when I approach. It's close at all times by my side in the holster. O-ster roast ya, make me blow my composure. Pop (*gunshot*) it's all over, when the fo fo blows and goes (*gunshot*). [Chorus]. When I'm up in the club. And these niggaz they wanna act tough. 'Til they get plugged. Watch them bullets go (*bullet shot*). Now you touched from a slug. Huggin the streets like you in love. Your heart race like (*flatline*). The ambulance arrive (*police siren*). They rush you to the spinner, flyin by my ride. Engine like (*engine revs*), homie you just died. Your family through cryin, I pulled off a crime. Just as quick as ... [Verse 2]. Lose your face, in a fool's race. I put my tune first nigga, you was in second place. And second place just means you didn't react with haste. And this differentiates life where murder bein the case. And since murder was the case, it just means niggas erase. Another black mother can't eat the food on her plate. Cause she ain't got the taste of raisin you was a waste. Such a short span young man, sit at your wake. First I'm a man, second I'm five eight, with size and weight. Won't give a nigga the upper hand. Cause when I pop (*gunshot*), I get a 's up like Barry Sand. Sit in the can, you never ran like Barry Sand. Obie ain't playin, Obie got a plan. And the plan is NOT to be layin in earths land. I will POP before decayin in earths land. You get SHOT for playin me less than a man motherfucker. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Niggaz get it twisted, liquor make 'em envision. that gangsterism is disrespectin a niggaz wishes. Which is all the touch talk in front of bitches. Yeah you fifteen deep, the Desert E a give ya stitches. And I can be all the bitches and hoes you wanna. But I warn ya the glock could make it hot as California. You be propped on the corner, flesh meetin the coroner. O's and quarantine, cause no hoes in need, is no hoes in need. Niggaz take advantage 'til I manage to pull that hammer out. They start scatterin, I'm no gangster, I'm a average man. but be damned if I let 'em do me savage man. Before that I'm strapped and will challenge him. Cocked back and that (*gunshot*) gat will damage them. It's not a act, this is fact, this is how I'm programmed. This is me, what I'm about, this who I am motherfucker."

ballad of obie trice,"[Chorus]. O, O, O, O, O. I think this. Obie Trice [7X]. O, O, O, O. [Obie Trice: talking over chorus]. I'd like to reintroduce myself, haha. If you don't know by now. It's Obie Trice man. [1st verse]. I came from nothing solo, straight outta the dumpster hobo. Made up my monster, I was cultivatingly slanging that cocoa. Hated the po po, locally known as abominable snow-o. Later the pig fo' rated the home where I made the dough grow. So on and so fo', the story of us urban negros. Created as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you. We as a people heated in evenings doing these evils. Gotta eat you, be cool, got a kid to feed that'll reach you. Or did it see thru? Or do I just speak thru the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel. When niggaz on the block gotta eat, gotta cop, gotta cot when they caught by the cops. Young Tupac's, laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks, fade away. Brick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free, that's why I'm. [Chorus]. [Obie talking over chorus]. Seen it, I done ate it, I done shit it. Slept it, lived it, now I spit it. Shady. [2nd verse]. Working that house off an no-doze, got an ounce to roll on. Trying to get rid of the pounds, I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on. Same old song, young nigga thats trying to get some where I come from. Funds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch, only way a city boy function. In conjunction with selling this substance. Chips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven. I'ma be hugging these corners till these corners corner me. But currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency. Gotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing. It's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be. Such a thirst for me, life almost took a turn for the worst for me took to see. I finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me. [Obie] Gotta do a little soul searching and [Obie] myself personally. And to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me. To confirm and unblur my dreams. Best believe since burst on the scene, I'ma be here certainly. With no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'ma get this cheese and that's why he's. [Chorus fades out]. [Obie talking over chorus]. That's why I'm. That's what made me. Haha. That's why I'm. Young black man in America. Get up and get yours nigga. I know you struggling man, I been there. I see you. Get up and get yours nigga. Ain't no looking back now"
battle cry,"Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. Battle cry. I've been shot by my critics. Took the bout by the cynics. Feel like my life's on display. Like the museum exhibits. Puts my life on the line. Invested years in these rhymes. Street's thirst and they need it. Now hear my battle cry. . O-Trice, back, at it. They don't wanna see him platinum. They just wanna see him pratted. They just wanna see him tec something. Get next to him. So they can be the first to rat it. Savage, put him in a cascet. Categorize him, say Cheers was a classic. That's it, as if. He ain't bring the city to the masses. Minus Mathers, but my name is astrous. Like the ain't shown them where the cash at mine. O has fucked[?], as you should. Never mind a player hater, as long as you could. Never change, gutter. So you can downplay my name, O still the same. Come on. . Keep going, keep going on. Keep going, keep going on. This my battle cry, battle cry. [x2]. Waiting with patience. In the dark like a vagrant. Determining this circus. [?] want entertainment. My wings have been clipped, but now I'm ready to fly. In the heavens with angels. While devils wished I died. . O-Trice, back, at it. I ain't never came whack. All I ever gave's crack. All I ever gave's back. Ain't a human being on this earth saying opposite that. You can misconstrue what he do. Cuz he cruise in an automobile?. I know how to double-up. Then double platinum. No matter the circus stands, see I emerge from that. Used to serve the bundles, now the verse intact. Used to worship onions, now I service rap. The certain cat's uncertain with that. They'd rather see him service, dirtnap. Like I deserve them curses. Like I don't speak in cursive. Like I ain't got a purpose. Beast of the streets. Dope stay on O-Trice's person. . Keep going, keep going on. Keep going, keep going on. This my battle cry, battle cry. [x3]. . Bme, Obie Trice, 2011, Bottoms Up. You know. Some days you the dog, some days you the hydrant.

bottoms up (intro),"I'd like to thank you all for purchasing the new Obie Trice album. It's well appreciated. I'd like to thank you all for copping my classic Cheers. The Seconds Round's On Me. It's well appreciated, no doubt. Detroit city stand up. . They say when a nigga for testing. They say that he stay kept with his Smith & Wesson. Story tells us his accomplishment's a blessing. Now that's what the fuck I call an urban legend. When a verse kept him from serving corrections. Turf he slept in had notorious conditions. All of symptoms that ought to send me to prison. Yet he had a vision. And since then, I've witnessed those visions. An eye witness. To put sense into it, you ain't listening. Get it? I hate to keep twisting 'em. My mind ventures, I spit with conviction. Nothing fabricated or based of forcism. Simply kicking what's living in O Trice's system. Come on. . I wanna thank Shady records for backing me up. For all those years. Nigga, Eminem, Paul Rosenberg, Riggs Morales. I wanna thank all my label mates, D12, 50 Cent, G-Unit. Stat Quo, Bobby Creek' and Cashis. It's been one hell of a run. . Album number truces, found him in a booth nostalging. With Dre pounding the beat machine. O Trice say nothing, deleting them. 'Scope couldn't destroy my evening. We are the elite, machine. Niggas is ass backwards, thinking they in the class, as if. And have access to these type of masses. When I seen this, massive. From a black teen with dreams of being this rapper. What happened is that he slipped between the cracks. Brought to your ears all the years that I've captured. Re-appeared after Cheers, the classic. Second Round's On Me showed you O mastered it. Cause Obie not an actor in this shit. Actually, it's action show you know different. I'm ah be a victim on the set that I lived in. 'Til I die, it's Obie Tri'. Try to understand this psychological spare. From serving them grams to inserving them fans. That's right, Obie hurting them, man"

Now I understand that every man got a story to tell. Well fuck it I got a story as well. Growin up where us niggas either buried or jailed. Popped by dirty Harry or popped by the cops for the yayo. Locked in a cell, whoâ€™s to blame. When I was raised in this hood where my crew was slain. Only a few remains, yo talk about struggle. With your bubble gum lifestyles nigga fuck you. Iâ€™m here today for fam passed away. Bodies deep six nigga flesh decayed. Real cats who had tecs to spray. Babies to raise, missed them cradles went strait to the grave. That hood life is in me. So I sip the remmie while my pockets scream gimme. Lend me your ear, Iâ€™m guaranteeing yall feelin me. Strait from the block to the industry. [Chorus]. Yeah!. All my homies thatâ€™s deceased rest in peace. My nigga ?. Lil green. P Funk youâ€™ll be home in a minute nigga. Haha, we get it poppin. Got a chance to speak to the world nigga. And I aint stopping. Strait off the crack."
crazy,"[Chorus] (2x). They say I'm crazy, and I don't give a fuck. Goose in the cup, 40 by the nuts. Crazy (lay a nigga down like what). Cause they don't know nothin 'bout me. . Trice is the truth, puncture your roof. If what I enunciate ain't gettin through you. Listen nigga, School Craft raised me. Hey bay-bay, you don't wanna fuckin play with me. I got the K covered up in the back. Got the pistol on my side nigga, O stay strapped. Stacks in the jeans, this is a natural thing. I don't act out a movie, I'm actually the scene. I pull up on the scene, nigga holla back. With a bad bitch Italian and black. They don't take double takes, they take Kodaks. Coast through the club relaxed, where the V.I.P. at. Coast under the cub, post underneath the duds. Supposed to, I'm a muh'fuckin thug. But they say he crazy cause he don't give a fuck. First nigga play me, light his ass up. [Chorus]. . Yeah I'm crazy, the hood made me. So O abide by the code on the daily. Niggaz get it twisted, bitches get it twisted. Cause I live like unrealistically. Ay, my nigga Breed in the booth with me. Motor City 'til them paul bearers dig me. Underneath the soil. Ain't no future in your frontin, nigga I'm Detroit loyal. . Oh so what you know karate? I know crazy. Hit you with somethin leave your left side lazy. Comin for the whole shebang, yup, believe that. Take it like I want it, get behind ya like I need that. 'Til I get more ""Whassup's"" than Martin. Get drunk, come through, bust up the party. Tonight, very night, Breed and Obie Trice. You say our ass crazy, yeah you motherfuckin right. [Chorus]. . Say I need Ritalin, cause when the choppers start riddlin. Bodies start droppin, disappearin. Tempers start flarin, nigga nuttin up. Ain't no comin back from that bruh. Ay, bad days some faggot in a bag. Give a fuck what neighborhood you at. What Dilla dick you suckin, when the pistols buckin. Lord knows someone family's sufferin. And I ain't the nigga that'll start the beef. I lay back, I ain't got a problem with G. But lick her and niggaz like twelve hits of E. Suicidal, somebody on their way to meet Jesus. These demons keep chasin me. Get away from me, or the Ak speaks. No wonder why they see him as a freak. Say he crazy, in the muh'fuckin street. [Chorus]"

Leave you wit a visible ulcer, oggle and off ya. Niggaz ought to when he lyrically off us. All cause he salty, I'm rollin like a boss. I don't follow nigga's course, I'm akward. My choice, Rock City is my voice. The White Boy stepped down, so I will accept the crown. Exceptional however, never let ya down. Found my new niche, no more bricks. So I'm pitchin 16's, verbally bitch. [Chorus]. ""Crrrrrry now"" Cry now. ""Crrrrrry now"" Cry now. ""Crrrrrry now"" Cry now. ""Crrrrrry now"" Nigga cry now. [Verse 2].

So we, cock the tools, and shoot our own color. This ain't Detroit Red, you won't (X) me out (Malcolm). I exit this, whenever be from a violent outcome. I turn Exorcist on niggaz wit extra clips. Exit on my ethics, is no longer present. X-rays show, I was this close to Heaven. So for future reference, I stay this close to a weapon {click-clack}. Who you testin, never said I was the best, never stressin. Don't make me get in my zone, I will own that whole note (fa sho'). Metaphorically, for where I roam on chrome yo (fa sho'). Detroit for niggaz that's slow, it's the O. I was birth wit Jehovah's hand on my soul. [Chorus]. ""Crrrrrry now"" Cry now. ""Crrrrrry now"" Cry now. ""Crrrrrry now"" Cry now.

So ya lames that got a problem wit the game - tough tit. He still in the same Range, windows fixed. And I'm killin 'em come a-gain, that's as real as it gets. Off ya, tryna make me depart ya, from my thought-a. Coffin's for you, and the nigga that brought ya. The hatin start in ya, release from our father. The people at the alter, saying ya better off. You don't wanna see a demon, come out of a humen being. Recent being the sience, and to him it's too extreme. Catch me in the BM, like Tupac and them. Or in that Tahoe like Christopher - NO. Poppa gon' keep poppin Cris on you hoes. And piss on those, who exist as my foes. O rolls through shit, spittin cold flows. Knows his business, I'll be missed if I go.

""Crrrrrry now"" Nigga cry now. [Outro]. ""Crrrrrry now"" [to fade]"
dear lord,"[Chorus]. Dear Lord, please forgive me, more I live I grow empty. Nothin in me, point out my enemy I'll put somethin in him. {blam} Feelin like that's the only remedy. Send him on his way when I fuck around his day. {""Okay!""} Cause to you they wanna send me. And I ain't got the energy, I'll let the clip empty. {""Okay! O-o-o-okay-k-kay! Kay-k-kay, kay-kay!""}. I ain't gotta walk around town with my chest stuck out. A frown up my face when the press come out. Niggaz know what it is, one of the best, no doubt. Doubt that, test him and the S's come about. Aggression niggaz need without. Too aggressive niggaz rest under leaves where the G's hang out. I'm back stronger than ever. D-boy so it's like whatever, however, whenever. I dare ya, pallbearers bury ya. Pardon my, positivity failure. But they ain't tryin to hear ya when niggaz'll go and air ya ass out. Send you to the morgue, turn ya inside-out. Send you to ya momma 'til she pass out. Too many partners in the casket now. These foul bastards, don't appreciate life so fuck 'em. The P-nina-nina stay dumpin (stay dumpin). [Chorus]. Now Trice ain't all about runnin his mouth. He do that for a livin; y'all gotta feel him. In the streets he mute, my nigga autism. Don't confuse this with art-ism. Nigga I refuse to lose, boss in him. Put your people in a pew when the mossberg start spittin. I'm livin, nigga I'm kiddin him. Take him from his paradise, Trice on his way to prison. Picture him leavin his children. I peel 'em; pilgrimage to another region. Them ecstasy pills got niggaz schemers[?]. When the weapons spill them same niggaz bleedin. 'Fore I leave this world they gon' believe him. O ain't deceivin these people, that's feedin 'em. The hood's what he breathin, it's all good. Leave him in that box all wood (box all wood). [Chorus]. Trice is nice with aim. Put a nigga, in a permament frame. When a nigga's, so determined to bang. Cause a nigga's, switchin lanes in that European thang. Don't be mad at your boy-boy, handle business. Cause he push the toy-toy, niggaz envious. Crutch him up, Jehovah Witnesses. When the semi's start spittin, listen (listen). [Chorus]. {blam}. {""Okay!""}. {""Okay! O-o-o-okay-k-kay! Kay-k-kay, kay-kay!""}. Dear Lord, please forgive me, more I live I grow empty. Nothin in me, point out my enemy I'll put somethin in him {blam}"

You the reason, when I hustle, I knew to stack. You the reason when I opened up mics, I knew to rip. The ethics you enstored. In this hectic young brotha rubbed off after all, now, look at your boy.. When they ask about me now, you don't just put your head down. Straighten up ma you could smile now proud. Everything's kosher with the boisterous O'ster. Let's get closer, so regrets Never Approach us.. [Chorus x2]. Don't Come Down, Things Could Always Work Out (I'm sorry). Don't Come Down, Things Could Always Work Out (Messed up). Don't Come Down, Things Could Always Work Out (Mom I love you)."

Took outta town trips, two seconds in a son of a bitch. NARCs run in talking shit (who dis?). I know about dope, lost my man Lou to the coke. Pumping over there off of DeSoto.

Black out from cold, freezin' my toes. Snow fuckin over my boots, my Tims froze. Face turnin blue, cars ridin by with the little children. on the inside pointin at you (mommy look at that man). Fucked over folks, and they don't wanna see ya. Baby momma gotta new nigga with a Visa. Sleepin in cars, abandoned shit. While the rats eat the wires you be prayin and shit (Please, Lord, please!). Close to pneumonia. Wishin for heat, like damn if only I came up in California. Plottin on a (?), like stickin your mans. Damn, you know he got at least a grand in his pants.

It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie. [1st Verse: Obie Trice]. They say Obie Trice gone, look at em. Back then I was Mike Jones, who would even look at 'em?. Now I recite songs with icons, see I come from convicts and crumbs. My nigga, listen, it's transition shows his ambitions. Nuttin less then the man getting off his ass and vanishing. Into the world of ass kissing, witness him with Ashton Kutcher. Now they ask for pictures, autographs, signatures. Went from rags to riches to getting ass from bitches. It's hard to grasp the situation at hand. When you used to have to ask for digits. Now they pass em to you like easy fast for tickets. Classic isn't it? Coming from a past with a casket. Dips from beneathe the grass, so you're cremated to ashes. Nigga, created from the crap, this is past fictious. Fif, tell em how we was when we last wen' visit. [Chorus]. [2nd verse: Obie Trice]. And now the spotlight's on Trice. But back when the spot life was Trice. I always kept beside a spot for a mic, despite. Wrongs and rights, I would write after I slung white. To homes on the pipe, I had a notion I would be bi-costal. But being across the ocean is la vida loca. And vada loco, I'm in Janayo. Konecheewa in Tokyo, it's sushi with eel. I got a taste for that pompies chopping up in Brazil. Drinking the finest wines in France on the hill. Now how real is he to come from where we get killed. To having all his dreams fulfilled, look out. I got fantasies of being in Italy where the women be. Offering me the cooch-o, eating on arsobuco. Awesome, I know, so often, we just reach the coffin. And never get to see what the world's offering. [Chorus]. [Outro]. [50 Cent]. Yeah. Things change man. You know, get a chance to travel. See the world and you start to look at things a lil different.

I call her ""Auntie"" she cop three at a time. Throw an extra bump bringing cline. I'm so involved with the grind, I'm losing my mind. Fuck a steady job, I'm trying. I steady mob, I'm dying in this game I ain't lying. Selling' so much ""Coke"" forgetting' it's a crime. Flying down I-75 pocket full of ""Dimes"". Give a fuck about the radar on me. Bumping' Biggie, Pac nigga who trying me?. [Interlude]. (Cop) Get off the god damn truck. (Obie) Yo I ain't doing shit. (Cop) Put your fucking hands in the air. (Obie) Bitch.... [Chorus].

ghetto (feat. trey songz),"Whoooo. Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto. [Chorus: Trey Songz 2X]. I'm from the motherfucking slums where the cops don't come. Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run. You ain't shit without no gun. In the ghetto (ghetto). Ghetto (ghetto). [1st verse]. I'm from where diapers full of feces. We's endangered species. Bodies lay in traffic, that's right, where the streets be. You ain't seen nothing this obscene from no TV. You would have to be me to feel what Obie's speaking. Bodies leak like steel pipes, it's real creepy. Ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha, Jason Vorhee's. You're boring me with your story, I'm a Detroitee. Craft took my mind so the craft exploits me. [Chorus]. [2nd verse]. I got no pot to piss in, en route to prison. You don't want it with us nigga, we strapped with nitroglicerin. Our ambitions is some riders, thriving off poor decisions. A blessing nigga still living, still pimping, still visions of. Sitting in that foreign whip, whipping up cola take a lick. To my tongue, numb from the shit. My nuts hung since I was a young one. And that's just the slum fuck of it. I'm pumped daddy gone but, gun in my palm. My momma can't save me her gender is wrong. On my own in this jungle that niggaz call home. What? His momma died from a lump in her D cup. Police freeze 'em up for serving these glucks. It's like a habitual situation, we stuck. The ritual is for niggaz to grab they nuts. And just soak all this bullshit up, where I'm from?. [Chorus]. [3rd verse]. I'm from real bridge cause, for niggaz living hard. Welfare scarers just most chicks'll buy them broad. Pimping the government cause government pimping us. Rather see 'em suffering then niggaz live it up. Cause you ain't heard? Bird got birds. But the nigga got murd' cause niggaz felt he ain't deserve. What he was worth, he ain't a real nigga from the turf. He was birth with money, that's why they left him bloody. I'm from the streets where most these niggaz nutty. I adapt to em, I'm exactly in tuned with 'em. Strapped with the Mac that extract flesh from humans. Home sweet home, better known as The Ruins. [Chorus]. Whoaa!"
gimmie my dat back,"[Chorus]. I want my Dat back. I want my Dat back. I need my Dat back. I want my Dat back. Where the hell is my Dat at. I want my Dat back. I need my dat back. I want my Dat back.

Yo I been listen to you since I was a small crop. I bought your tape and watched your career flop. I post your face up in my room. You had the grim look so when I was mad nigga you was mad too. You blessed me with opportunity to listen. And by droppin an album you made music my mission. I would turn on the TV. All I see is DMC who I truly want to be. And mama bought a karaoke machine. As present, so I can have sessions with the young adolescence. In my room. Fuck a cartoon. I'm to busy trying to get at you. With this music. And as time went on my skills got tighter. An unbelievable writer, unbelievable reciter. Hit the hip hop spots. Closed the ciphers. Obie trice dark like a phantom with flows. And by this time shit you like a platinum with those. [Chorus]. I gotta get me a Dat. I need a Dat. What the hell is a dat? (Digital Audiotape). Get a Dat. I gotta get a Dat. Yoâ€¦ What's a Dat. [Verse 2]. Hey yo you came to my town one day I got the word. The illest emcee in the rap game most preferred. I thought it was a start for me to exploit my style. And maybe you lend a hand out. So I dropped what the fuck I was doin. Grabbed the DAT.

going nowhere,"You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy. You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy. Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me. I ain't going nowhere right now.... . It's the fo' pound bandit. The coke hand to hand, and he Detroit bredded. Goddanmit O Trice's back. And Oh, they so adamant I'm still at it. You should see the grill on a faggot if only looks could kill. But O is so accurate over this matter stagnant. It's never inadequate I swear these haters need to chill. It's So automatic that he is above average. Jesus of Nazareth's reached his soul and so. He is a talent that has managed to mechanically. use a pen and a pad and the alphabet to get ahead. Niggas mad cuz he single handledly getting this bread. Bitches is in his bed, bullet still in his head. I'm back, fully loaded I'm ready to let off lead. Metal is heavy and I'm ready to let it all rip. The return of the vigilante on that big party and bullshit. You dig? The kid's back you biatch. . I don't suffer the whispers of these envious niggas. Mad cuz his nuts not in my Denim. Wanna be him so much the send slugs to kill him. And keep it on the hush not to become a victim. Vicious, niggas I rid them.

I'mma ball, I'm a beast, I'm the streets. I'm the reason you a broad, I'mma boss, I'm me. Obie bout that change, get rich fast. The Claude Van Damme of the game: Kick ass. Trapped until a nigg get out of 'Caine. And bounce back like whiplashes. And dump my cigar ashes on you asses. It's still Trice and Mathers all that matters. Call that other madness, past us. This is passion. . My feet up, I read up. Read up on a Mc who fordid, a overachiever. My Visa tease them in that villa overseas in that. B1w with mamacita. G'd up, Jesus my cheese keep reaching up. Planted the seed and then it beamed up. The bean stalk being tall. Now I'm balling on these motherfucking peanuts. Huh, the demons wanna deliver me. Wanna deem him less than enemy but O too slippery. But back on you faggots nigga ain't no sympathy. I don't fuck with you actors I do mine differently. Trice made history, now all these fake niggas wanna mention me. Couldn't wait till I break in this with my entity. It don't even interest me, I'mma keep my energy spitting. Obie is in this to win this and that's the ending"

Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal. She holla cause I got a lot of denerio. The DJ's playin Obie song on the stereo. And she's impaired and she wants to be headin home. With the real thing not the dildo clone. And I know I don't wanna be headin home. With some double D's full of silicone. Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside. Found me outside, clown me outside.

I'm quick to murder ink with lead and talkin' bout a pencil. Lookit what the fuck you done got into. I see you found yo niche, you just a bitch wit a menstrol. Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong. You put 'e' before the 'd' cuz that's all you on. You on Pac's dick, you a regular guy. If Pac was still alive you would never get by. All you do is cry, bitch keep it real. Life is more than imitating niggaz and eatin' pills. And kind of muthafucka ruins three deals. That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills. And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated. And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover cuz he need it. And all you niggaz hatin', shut you mouths. It's just that real niggaz ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out. [Obie Trice]. Do-ra-mi, but we don't sing muhfuckas'. So Murder Inc. do ya thing muhfuckas'. You've unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less. Than R&B comin' from that regime. Regime... It's a little extreme. Neck and necks with soldiers, muhfuckin' Marines. Ja sold his soul to sing. We've eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed. Now that you've embraced the green. Don't fuck with the triple beams. You's a muthafuckin actor slash Pac impersonatin' rapper. Slash Billie Holliday how it happen?. Artist for Repetuar saw him in action. Pac assassination Def Jam grabbed him. Told him reinact him, you go platinum. They seen it for sure, I know that Afina Shakur. Don't enjoy Jeffery Atkins reinactin' her boy. So I'm click-clackin' this toy. Bash and destroy, Shady. Aftermath and Detroit muthafuckas.

Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs. To the greivance and the cryin' and the intimate hugs. We don't take you serious nigga you shook you half of a half-way crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga. And you can't replace the late greal one. And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one. Nigga please, stick to the script. before the guns stick to the clip, and Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch. Fuckin' old ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen. Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive. Wait a minute, hold on. Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?. A bitch made man, now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a tyrannasaurus rex?. You niggaz can scream holler and curse. Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta ya purse. (Proof). Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas. He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas. What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on. Put your ear to the ground for stucky and bush stones. What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz?. Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us. It's real business you ain't caught the concept. You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press. Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source. Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch. Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us. But Detroit niggaz ?? and ain't scurred to bust. (Kon Artis). Word to my nigga Bugs, punks like you get beat up. Stomped unconcious and smacked with the heater. This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina. Who's behind ya? Cadillic Pac or that transvestite who dress like a Lil Kim fox, her chest like a little windbox. press tight on the trigger of this glock. Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat. You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep. You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac. You 'Mockaveli', get your own identity. [Chorus]. [Eminem overdubs chorus]. Yeah!. Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again!. Fuckin' punk pussy little bitch!. I'll fuck you up boy!. Never! Never in your muthafuckin life!.

hands on you,"(feat. Eminem). [Obie Trice]. Babe uh, yeah!. Girl, you my only one though aight, haha. You my baby, fuck all that shit. You're the one for me. Check it out.. [Verse - Obie Trice]. Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style. And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out. I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling. Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands. Cause the vibe you giving me now. Feels like I'm an innocent child. Sinning is never tempting when other womens around. Hands down, this is my vow. I never heard a moan sound so profound. When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings. You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!. If I call, you're in route. There's a drought, you look out. I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze. Please believe I ain't scared of commitment. Fuck head from them bitches!. When you could do the same, but that respect is given. Our intimacy is significantly different. [Chorus - Eminem (Obie Trice)]. You gon ride for me (you gon ride?). Then I'm gon ride for you (I'm gon ride). If you put your mouth on me (put it on me). I'm a put my mouth on you. Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing). Any problem we can see it through (we see it through). Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?). I will never put my hands on you. Come on and think about it. [Verse - Obie Trice]. We ain't even got to talk when we see each other. We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers. You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin. Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand. Visions of you having my little man. We joke, you call me George Foreman. Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three. Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be. I'm in the bathroom when you pee. She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo. There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to. Satisfy - this my bitch that ride. My bitch wit the pistol in the ride. A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide. No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin. You're fucking wit her husband. [Chorus]. [Verse - Obie Trice]. Come on and think about it. You got a ring about it. Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage. Drama we overcome it if we out numbered. I promise it'll be us against a hundred. Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter. Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach. Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper. Enough to call O her Baby Father. You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real. Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal. It's signed and sealed, you the only female. Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail. Post bail and post up for sale. I swore, I swear we will always live well. Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills. Who's gon stop up? nobody! we's that deal. [Chorus]. [Bridge - Eminem (Obie Trice)]. If you gon stand by me (if you gon stand by me). Then I'm gon stand by you (then I'm gon stand by you). If you promise you'll be true. Then I'll never put my hands on you (hands down). But! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!. Cause if I put my mouth on you (on you). After you put your mouth on someone else. Better find someone else new. Come on and think about it. [Outro - Obie Trice]. Yeah.. Obie Trice. Shady!."
hell yeah,"They say he lonely, he ain't got big homie. He strayed from Interscope now they don't know me. Only reason he succeeded was reverse E. Or maybe he was nursed by a Doc beat. But Slim and Dre's still in my Dna. (""Chka-chka Slim Shady""). They say he lonely, he ain't got big homie. He strayed from Interscope now they don't know me. Only reason he succeeded was reverse E. Or maybe he was nursed by a Doc beat. But Slim and Dre's still in my Dna. Consume my body, found a trace of gangsta party. But I don't give a fuck in my artery. It's Bme but fam forever part of me. [Chorus]. I'ma have to go on without quote-unquote. (""Hell yea""0you know the boy Trice dope. Put a few of you niggaz through high school. Hyped ya Iq, average man into a psycho. (Obie!)

As a music listener I know who y'all vote for. But e'rything black's not white, white's not black. That's the music business for ya. But as a consumer 'stead of you gettin a tumor. You opt out for the obvious bloomer. But the least obvious the one that'll do ya. That's learned knowledge from comin up in the sewer. And I ain't wreckin my cap to (Fuze) the gap. I just want (Yoo-hoo), this is the music to adapt. And if that ain't real rap. Obie Trice need to fall back - fuck that. [Chorus]. . Through digi' design might lose my mind. So the digits I make won't be a surprise. Eyes wide open, Obie know you're fake. You ain't gotta say a word, I can see through your make. Wait 'til I get in hip-hop I'ma take. Give it to the needy, he who appreciates. No it's not the hustle. But you gotta have some type of love for this culture I grew up to. Muster up somethin for the folks who appreciate vocals. 'stead of them duds that make 'em roast you. Who am I to coach as well?. I'ma take a different approach, you niggaz pound-sign, fail"

Yeah, cool, now tally-o your ass back across the room. You see me with Pocahontas. I ain't tryin to be honorary but honestly I ain't tryin be bothered. You got a brain, define honors in college. You'd rather define how your knowledge in chronic. I'm tryin step my game up a notch bitch. Your aim the cock block on my plot bitch. She hot and your not, so stop bitch. Quit blowin up my motherfuckin spot, shit. [Chorus]. How could you be here? Why don't you leave here. I ain't tryin to see you everytime at my show. I got a piece here, you ain't gotta speak there. You know how we get down on the low. Your playin me cheap here. Tonight I don't drink beer. I got a bottle, so it's time for you to go. You's the freak here, you don't know me here. She's a model, you my late night ho. [Verse 2]. They chase me (Obie, Obie), when they see me in the club. With a lot alike Stacey Dash, they gettin mad.

That's what I get just for stabbin them hoes. They nag, when I pose with a chick with nice toes. Ya'll knew O before for new hoes, but since it's a new ho. Just act like you never knew O, boo.

This is for the rats, go on with that (go on). Quit actin like you smokin that crack. Cause he pokin that chick, you ain't ownin on shit. Ain't no rings on that finger. And every nigga in the hood ain't triple teamed her. [Chorus]. [Obie Trice - talking]. That's right, ha, you see me at the club. with a, with a look-alike Halle motherfucker.

jamaican girl,"Call me baby, baby. {She say}. Call me baby, baby. {She say}. Call me baby, baby. {She say}. Call me baby, baby. {She say}. [Chorus: Brick & Lace]. I just want you in my arms Obie. Hold you till the morning Obie. Know you got it going on Obie. I don't hear what the rumbleclots say {She say}. I just want you in my arms Obie. Hold you till the morning Obie. Know you got it going on Obie. Sex and on that good love to me. [1st Verse]. She say she like em dark skinn-ded. Not timid, wanna rumble in my loft is it. Talk different, her walk's exscusite. Switch is ridiculous, locks is twisted. Like a block she said visit us. Jamrock why don't you picture us, with. Kids or whip, a ton of cannabis. So I can can it on a cannoe. Sippin coconuts like its a can of some brew. I'm what she plan to hold on to {she say}. [chorus]. [2nd verse]. Haters wanna hate, hey no way, hey. She'll slit ya throat, mess around with O. She move a pound of coke, like brown with hopes. Of being close to folk, if you clown ya poked. No joke, murder she wrote, provoke me no a rotty. Be a dead body, it be that dread hotty. Me no know noone that more potty. Down on her knees, up in the party to please my body {she say}. [chorus]. I just want you in my arms Obie. Hold you till the morning Obie. Know you got it going on Obie. I don't hear what them rumbleclots say {She say}. I just want you in my arms. Till the break of dawn we can get it on Obie. Ain't no need to prolong Obie. Realest nigga on this song is Obie. [3rd verse]. Way she move, got me in her hypnotic ways. Her voice manuevers, got me thinking bout her day to day. See I'm faced with beauty, there's nothing more for me to say. Put on the dance floor and play with Obie. And it's no cliche, O's great like the lake. So she pon'd the river her way of doing the snake. Jamaican God, make a true playa break. Say it ain't so, ya truth is fate. Incense lit when she's interested in insertion. Any minute ya squirting, she gifted in. Giving you the business, hurting em. Plus she know that art of perversion {she say}. [chorus]. Call me baby, baby [x12]. [talking fades out]"
lady,"Obie Trice]. Can we re- can we re-enact Biggie's song?. C-can you shit on me?. I just want you to shit on me. [Hook - Eminem {*singing*}]. Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby. I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend. If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions. I'll kill you. Bitch I'm fuckin'. For real. I'll make you suffer like I suffered. If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love. {*in the background of the hook*}. Hey lady, hey lady. I don't think you really wanna be my girl. (be my girl, be my girl, be my girl). Fuckin' with me can be dangerous (dangerous, dangerous). You never know what I really (be like, be like). (be like, be like, I'm the type). (that might flip and get a little bit crazy). [Obie Trice]. Baby I'm extra large (huge) in magnitude. And Magnums to lubrication that I use. To chose which hole on a hoe I abuse (yes). Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who. When I fuck the shit out you, then the next date (bitch). I rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait). You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's. Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own. No, I'm in and out your home. And this in and out your tone. I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down. Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around (nah). I bounce 'em around. Camcord the sex and sell 'em around town. Now how that sound?. If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown. Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown. Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me. Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury. You don't want it with me, you just horny as me. You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be. [Eminem]. I'm internationally known baby but actually. There are few people who know how I am naturally. All you know is that I can act irrationally. When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV. So they label me this crazed loony rap bully. But truthfully that ain't the truth. And if you believe in that shit. Then you'll believe anything's true. And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally. But personally that actually works for me. Cuz the last thing that I need's a string attached to me. I'ma bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury. To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers. Cuz see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully. But we do still make booty calls occasionally. But be damned if I end up back in that pattern. And we end up back at that god damn tavern. And havin' another dÃ©jÃ  vu, we seein' security. Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry. I got news for you bitch, your news curfew's early. You ain't home by 2:30 {*gunshot*}. [Hook - Eminem {*singing*}]. Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby. I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend. If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions. I'll kill you. Bitch I'm fuckin'. For real I'll make you suffer like I suffered. If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love. {*in the background of the hook*}. Hey lady, hey lady. I don't think you really wanna be my girl. (be my girl, be my girl, be my girl). Fuckin' with me can be dangerous (dangerous, dangerous). You never know what I really (be like, be like). (be like, be like, I'm the type). (that might flip and get a little bit crazy). [Obie Trice]. See you lookin' at the life, you lookin' at the lights (lights). You lookin' at the ice (ice) you ain't lookin' at the Trice (right). You should look at some advice when I see he ain't nice (nope). Despite the fact you think you the feisty type. O love to fight (uh) I love the drama (yeah). Love when my bitch get to cussin' out Yolanda (fuck you bitch). Find the Obie condom on the counter. Swingin' her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe. Least I ain't deceieve and try to mislead. And sell a dream just to get you on my team. I came clean to keep down the beef. Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth. [Eminem]. So what we do under the covers should stay between the covers. And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage. On the front page cover of ""Buzz's New Lovers"". And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors. Cuz the truth of it, everything that I do's public. And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends. Guess who you just screwed, assume just me and you've done it. And save da used rubber to show 'em the proof of it. But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you. But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to. Cuz you never know when the shoe. Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you. Cuz you think you want it then you want me, then you get me. Then you got me and you're fucked, cuz you'll be stuck with me. For the rest of your life cuz if I get attached to you. We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you. You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you. Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you. You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you?. Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you. And have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters. Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather. Front on me? Never. Cuz we gonna be together forever. Right bitch? {*gun cock*}. Right bitch? {*gun cock, shot*}. [Hook - Eminem {*singing*}]. Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby. I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend. If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions. I'll kill you. Bitch I'm fuckin'. For real I'll make you suffer like I suffered. If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love. {*in the background of the hook*}. Hey lady, hey lady. I don't think you really wanna be my girl. (be my girl, be my girl, be my girl). Fuckin' with me can be dangerous (dangerous, dangerous). You never know what I really (be like, be like). (be like, be like, I'm the type). (that might flip and get a little bit crazy). (fall in love) (crazy). (fall in love) (crazy)."
lay down,"[Obie Trice]. Here we go. [Verse 1: Obie Trice]. You could get popped; it's a possibility up in my vicinity. Poppin off with that hostile energy. In a hospital with a doctor getting in. When adrenaline is mixed with an obnoxious temperament. Honestly I got a monster pistol gripped. And I commence to spit, none of y'all exempt from it. Spit, spit, passes from it. You get stiff from it, church man see your box plummet. And I will never let 'em give it to me. I gotta live to be one hundred and three. Gotta reach my epitome, wanna seize my enemy. And receive my penalty nigga. [Chorus 2X]. LAY DOWN! (Lay down..). I'm a man, man. I ain't runnin, I'ma stand wit my gun in my hand. I got plans and a place to BE!. [Verse 2: Obie Trice]. I ain't tryna cocky wit it, but I'm a nigga from the block that did it. Got a nine that's livid, I ain't tryna see the box in prison. Getting knocked outta my position. Now I got a pot to piss in, pissed off motherfuckers' mouth off - bitchin. Probably cause he lack ambition, so his wack decisions. Get mad at the nigga that's getting 'em. That's when he see the next nigga that's hittin him. With a vigorous pistol over this ridiculous issue. Dismiss you, in attempt to. Take me out my motherfuckin tempo nigga. [Chorus 2X]. LAY DOWN! (Lay down..). I'm a man, man. I ain't runnin, I'ma stand wit my gun in my hand. I got plans and a place to BE!. [Verse 3: Obie Trice]. Niggaz get nauseated, a artist made it. Had it hard against odds and emancipated. To the floor I spit cause, god damn they hate it. To see the lady they dated caterin to the latest. Shadiest artist, up in my radius. Get faded with a plated revolver. Rated me R, haters get faded with horror. Erased, no fate for tomorrow. All cause he think he hard tough. Got a car cause, he was runnin at the mouth, hush. I will never let 'em give it to me. I gotta live to be one hundred and three. Gotta reach my epitome, or decease my enemy. And receive my penalty, that'll be the end of he. Tryna seize my entities, finna be the end of his identity. When I tell him to. [Chorus 2X]"

love me (feat eminem & 50 cent),"[Obie Trice]. You don’t see me in the hood. It’s cuz I’m doin this man. [Obie Trice]. Niggaz I’m still grindin’. I’m still hearin’ those sirens. I’m still getting chased by those lights. Only the lights lime, and my mics on. And my time is none. Because I’m writing more. And I aint here to meet a soul in this business. I’m here to eat, speak until these hoes feel this. And I can’t let y’all derail me man. I got young Kobe hommie, you gotta let go of Obie. Cuz Obie be back, we get them craps going on and that giach going on. Soon as a nigga touch down backs from tourin. Cuz whatever put that on the cheddar man. But in the meantime its Jimmy Ivean time. Chase cheese rhyme till my voice give out. This is it my nigga’s, this what we boast about. Now I’m here, so shut your muthafuckin mouth. And show me love bitch. [Chorus]. I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life. I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night. I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life. I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night. [Eminem]. There’s a certain mystique, when I speak. That you notice that’s sorta unique, cause you know its me. My poetries deep and I’m stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat. You can’t sit still, its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep. I’m strapped, just know in any minute I could snap. I’m the equivalent of what would happen if bush rapped. I bully these rappers so bad, lyrically. It aint even funny, I aint even hungry, it aint even money. You can’t pay me enough, for you to play me, its cock-a-many. You just aint zanney enough, to rock with shady. My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock’s coo-coo. I got screws loose, yeah the whole kitten kaboodle. I’m just brutal, its no rumor, I’m numero uno. Assume it, there’s no humor in it. No more you know, I’m rollin with a swollen bowlin’ ball in my bag. You’ll need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass. You better love me… bitch. [Chorus]. I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life. I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night. I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life. I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night. [50 Cent]. My boys is crazy in the hood, they holler my name. If it aint about the flow it’s about the stones and the chain. If I was you, id love me too, I roll like a boss. 9/11 paws same color as cranberry sauce. I aint gonna front, I thought R. Kelly was your shit. Let me find out he fuckin round with Bow Wow bitch. Niggaz eatin popcorn right, rewindin the tape. Now Shorty, Momma and the Priest sit, hollerin rape. I’m convinced man, sumtin really wrong with these hoes. I thought Lil’ Kim was hot, till she start fuckin with her nose. Used to listen to Lauren hill, and tap my feet. Then the bitch put out a CD, didn’t have no beat. That boy D’Angelo, he determined not to fail. That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell. My back shots help Ashanti hit them high notes. Then Big Ben taught Charli B’more to deep throat. Yea…. [Chorus]. I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life. I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night. I just wanna love you, for the rest of my life. I wanna hold you in the morning, hold you through the night"
loyalty,"[Intro](Eminem). Whoa! Yeah! Ahh! (Mutha'f**ka's think they know us). G-g-g-g Guess whos back? D-Twizze!, O-Twizzie!. Doc-Twizzie!, Shady-Twizzie!, slash Aftermath!. Fiftycent!, G Unit!, Here we go!, Free Yayo!. Mutha'f**ka!, Benzino!, They don't know we finna' blow!. Someone betta' tell them so. .. [Verse 1] (Swifty McVay). You don't me, McVay and I doubt if you understand me. Why would I give a f**k about you if we ain't family?. I roll with a chosen few, and those of you that's behind me. Witness the most potest' furocious *****s that rhyme. These b*tches turn they back on you, actin' like they ain't did sh*t. When you rappin' never mix bussiness up with your friendship. If you lackin' up in this jungle, then what you breathe fo'?. *****s's don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes. Far as static, I automaticly get medieval. When i'm after people, then i'll explode you b*tches with C-4. These hoe's, have no insurance, bodies get repo'. Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close. Keepin' .44's where you're hoes are swallowing deep throat. If you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep, close. *****'s pupils that's what I do, i'm foolish will shoot you. Cuz' i'm coo-coo, But I don't think *****s can take in heat tho'. [Chorus x2](Kon Artis). See i'm a man, and a man gon' do what he gotta do. And he ain't really family if he ain't loyal to you. If they was really soldiers then they would do what we do. And be loyal to crew and crew was loyal to you. [Verse 2] (Bizarre). I don't give a f**k, i'm quick to blaze chronic. Smoke on so much green, use twelves and supa-sonic. Bizarre pack guns and knives, put to dick to 'Nuns and Wifes. Now who the f**k want to fight?. Ain't nobody f**king with me, Ain't nobody f**king with the D'. They get beat like a M-P. You heard about Bizarre taking all them drugs. You heard about Proof wil'ing in the clubs. You heard about that nine that Eminem packs. You diss us, you get you're f**king face cracked. I'm from 7 Mile and stout, I'll shoot up you're house. Next day, i'll pee in you're mouth. .. (Obie Trice). Aiyyo, loyalty's first, all the bullsh*t second. I showed you on the record, Cheers to who respect it. Most of these *****s neglect it. Even though it's a known method. >From the hectic hood that you slept in. You wanna' be an exeption. That's when the weapon is leaving you're half stepping. With that 'caine in you're left hand. Obie from a section that'll stain up you're flesh and. Have you on bare breast. Questionin' you're affection for streets. D-Twizzie no question. One of the best groups that done it. And Obie is their reflection. Lil' homey that know sowly that loyalty is reckin'. D-Twizzie fo' life, Obie Trice is second. .. [Chorus x2]. [Verse 3] (Proof). Which one of you *****s wanna' be ?boltion? bump heads. When I got a passion for clappin'. .with one hand. Talent's on my roster this mobster's in dump land. Send a gangsta to sleep two by two like bunk beds. Never leave the crib without packing my black burner. On some T. Ali rapper to merk a have murda. Incorporated, Hitman Herry is at you're service. Reach for me one more gain' and thats closed. For life as D12, no ice and spreewells. Every night that I chill in, I fight by free-will. Knowing I can be killed. Leaving my group, pieces of proof with a reason to shoot. And a liecense to ill. We lost Bugz and i'll be damed if we loose another man from our clan. Without forcing our hand. Estorting you're family, i'll torture you're granny. For my *****'s, i'm on you're motherf**king porch with a 'Cammy. [Chorus x2]. [Verse 4] (Kuniva + Kon Artis). Yo its funny how *****s get caught along (and get bombed on). Knocking teeth in back of you're throat (and break you're jaw bone). (I'm on ignorant sh*t) these *****s is b*tch. Pass me a cigarrete quick (sh*t is finna' get thick). Yo' man i'll get split (by a brutal and critical hit). With identical dent (or bullets with identical prints). I'm wishing you if (you come you're Lutenints a snitch). You teminant fick (and we know you ain't finna' do sh*t). I'll stick with my clique (The Kon Artis Bomb Artist). Kuniva The Rida' (Shooting through you're f**king Long John garmets). Dirty Dozen (We deep in the street). Unbelivable heat, we'll even lay you out infront of the chief of police. Muthaf**ka'. [Chorus x2]. [Outro](Kon Artis). Yeah! D-Twizzie. D12, Dirty Dozen. Nothing but family up in this muthaf**ka'. Loyal to everything that we do. You ain't neva' gonna' catch none of us slippin by ourself. 'Cuz we always together. You know what i'm sayin . .. Y'all *****s don't know what family means. Bugz watching over our ass. Thats why we still alive know. Knocking yall *****s outta the clubs and sh*t. Haha! Runyan Av. Baby!. Shady Records!. Where yo' mamma at *****?"

my time,"[Intro]. Got money on my mind, no time for nonsense. I'm gettin mine, 'bout to shine around here. Lights in the bezel, price up a level. Twenties on the feet, catch him in the street. Twenties on the Hemi, nigga made his quota. Nigga still (Shady), even though we over. That don't stop my dollars from rollin over the mower. I'ma put that product out until my casket below us. Obie never slow up, gettin it sho' 'nuff. I'ma be a problem 'til the world freezes over. Pistol in this holster, shootin like the Pistons. Bitches on his dick cause they know he about his business. Beatin up the block is somethin very expensive. Ice in his watch, haters payin attention. Trice in the cockpit navigatin the engine. Aviators watchin for haters tryin to stick him. Get money 'til the day I'm a victim. 'Til I lay beneath the clay all stiff then. But for now I'ma get my rich in. Double that dollar - flippin. [Chorus]. Got money on my mind, no time for nonsense. I'm gettin mine, 'bout to shine around here. Lights in the bezel, price up a level. Twenties on the feet, catch him in the street. Bet a nigga like me never catch him on the beat. Get that bet twice, I'ma catch him with the heat. Money on my mind, homie on the grind. Been away a minute but it's my time. Jumpin out of cars, in and out of broads. Spendin, we ain't penny addin, we be gettin ours. Show you how to floss, show you buy the bars. Y'all all talk, we notice y'all flaws. Y'all in-laws, we married to the game. Y'all just the mayne, next to the mayne. I been spendin change since the dope game. Then he made a name for himself after cocaine. Call him Kwame Kilpatrick, you could try to catch him. Dope I got access, no text messagin. Trice is an asset. Niggaz in the trap know his past say he know where the cash at. Louie on his toes, dubs on the vehicle. Bme, I see it though. I'ma need it my nigga then repeat it though. D-boy in that two-seater, let's go!. [Chorus]. In and out of jets, him is but a vet. Been around the world, him ain't finished yet. And I don't need London to bloke or be stuntin. I poke out like a bunion in any country I run in. With any culture the code is his ulcer[?]. Thug co-exist in the hood to Nova Scotia. Fists full of dollars, lipstick. On a nigga's collar courtesy of your missus. You don't wanna miss this, misfit. Mr. Michigan, gettin this, richness, in. I'm a better me, tell me who 'head of he?. I'm somethin like veteran usin letters over melodies. Trice is still in it. Real name, no gimmick, never fold cause of business. (Business) Bitches (bitches). I'ma get it fo' X over, nigga you be the witness. [Chorus]"
never forget ya,"[Verse 1 - Obie Trice]. Yes I understand I done came a long way. From huggin them corners to appearin on TV. From choppin up nicks, like this here feeds me. To makin 'em hits, like this shit's easy. But it's not, it's a whole lot of bullshit involved. And truthfully, I'd rather be bullshittin with ya'll. But I gotta chase the donuts, cocoa's growin. And it's like ""oh shit, she was just born"". And now she knowin every song on the radio (radio). If I hear another Bow Wow quotable ([laughing], oh no).

Keena Johnson, I will never forget ya (never forget ya). [Verse 3 - Obie Trice]. And now that the album is sold (uh huh),the story unfolds. Cause I'm probably asleep on your living room flo' (sleep). Whether gold or plat, O. Trice always knows to go back (yeah). pass the Carnac (pass that shit), crash the Cadillac. Nigga ain't shit changed (uh), just a lot a change (uh huh). a whole lot a brain (yep, brain), a whole lot a dates (dates). a whole lot a thang (and a whole lot a thangs). But hey I'm from the D, I got a whole lot a game (got a whole lot a game). And I promise, I'm as thorough as you made me. Detroit living, I'm in thoroughly with Shady (ohh yeah).

Rest in peace my nigga Lou Green, I will never forget ya (never forget ya). Little Randy, I will never forget ya (never forget ya). Keith, I will never forget ya (never forget ya).

I'm rest to go, rest to go, haha [never forget ya - repeats]. I'm rest to go. The color ain't purple, the color is green. And lets get this money. Hop-o, haha, yeah."
obie story,"[Mom] Momma's so proud of you, you did so good on that report card today baby. I'mma let you pick out whatever you want. [Obie] Ma, I can get any shoes I want?. [Mom] That's right, today is your day. Momma don't have much, but I'll spend it all on you today. [Obie] Okay, I want these. Ah man, I'mma look fresh when I go to school. Such a beautiful thing, being embraced by a woman that's a queen. With big dreams for the younger sibling. O couldn't do no wrong. According to report cards Obie brought home. They say good in spelling. Spelling bee's always excelling. Which was so overwhelming that Momma took him shopping. Copped him the new Jay's. Swear to God homie this was Obie's cool days. BMX'ing up the block with the tennant living next to him. Shooting hopes, who got hops?. Worthy, when he pop a jump shot. No worries, just a pocket full of sugar or whatnot. Hit the candy house on the block. It was pickle in them spot. Then things turn around when Obie'll lay down. Hear the sounds of fire rounds surrounded em. Astounded him, the volume of the blast had me so interested. Momma falling with cash, she can't get a nigga in this bitch. They wanna hit the ass, nigga start ditching class. Dad ain't around, he left a nigga. Sagging in them Superman drawers that one Saturday. Is it my fault, shit got dark?. Mom and I fall apart, relationship taunts, bad talk. ""Can't stand you, looking like ya Daddy with that same walk"". {Muthafucka you - }. Now a niggas out in the streets. Two nickle plated thirty-eights on me. Can't stay away from beef. Scrapping with them niggas from the other side. Sipping Saint Ives rocking old school flannels. Old school niggas see that I'm an animal. Front me at 16, see how my roll handle. Now I'm up the O's but wait on the affy. Cuz here come my muthafuckin baby, cool. Had to slow my role. Plus my P.O. got a nigga pissing in a bowl. Hold my temperment cuz I see such innocence. When I'm looking in Kobe's pupils. Despite all the dope I sold I had to change my road. I just might be able to grow old. Older brother said, ""Yo O. I'mma quit my job so we can chase our goals. I'll be manager-a-go, you can rap I suppose"". That's what we did, I still flipped a little bit. Saved up my chips and put it into music. ""Well Known Asshole"" a underground hit. Still scrambling, looking like shit. Baby momma think I'm smoking more then a spliff. Think a blessing came from the man who invented my gift. When Eminem said ""let me hear you spit"". Wrote my signature, now Shady Obie represents. Hit em with the D12 skit. Can exhale now I see my Mom's ain't pissed. She hit em with a smile cuz Obie became focused. From independent out the trunk like them dope kids. To platinum plaques, world tours, getting noticed. An inappropriate soldier became so ferocious. In this Hip-Hop culture that I long for. The roller coaster O was on so young. Took a turn right into his song. That's right, from after school fights. To pushing white, to pursuing his career heights. One mic's, all I need involved with beats. I'mma be the streets to Jesus, cars on me. And that'll be the day you applaud and see. The underdog gets his eventually. Gotta end it though. I'm all in it, there's no limits. And it's so splendid. Real names, no gimmics. No image, just a soldier who spoke what he lived. From the ribs with it, the flows vintage. Obie gotta do this for real. Yeah. Obie Tric"
oh!,"[Verse 1]. Yeah...Obie Trice, real name ""no gimmicks"". I came in the game, profane no ""image"". I came in the game with a name I's given. From a mane who ain't give a fuck about his chit-len. I proclaim the name no, never in vain no,. Watch the change grow. A young nigga who don' gain from fame. Cop the ""Range Rove"". Now they want my brains on the main road. But they don't understand what I came for. I came forth with a million sold. Who said you can't grow from mildew?. And mold, getting money like ""Ross Perole"". I'm often told, a coffin's the route's I go. ""O"" that's the roads you on, ""OH NO"". I'm down for the rightful tone of fo-fo. Don't ever try to send a nigga home. (NO, NO). I know you wanna catch me at ""Sinoko"". Show me that you're loco, put holes in my photo. Nope! Obie! Hold toast no jokes send slugs threw your ""Polo"". Just cause oh a thug roll solo. Impose on grown folks, be a cold Negro. Be low, you grieved up people. Believe that the ""boy"" see no evil. [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. Oh...I have you yelling' out when I bag the ""30/30 Rifle"". Oh...To late for niggaz to get religious and start reading they Bible. Oh...See you get down like other niggaz you be in that dirty cycle. Oh...See you should make peace instead of making me become a psycho. [Verse 2]. I visualized it.... 'O Trice at twenty-five survived it,. Pride but violent. Invite the violence, fist fighting the fireman. Beat retirement, 'til these niggaz nights is silent. 'O Trice from a trifling environment. He rocks the mic no sight of retiring. Maybe when the bank accounts light like fire then. I'm in position to hire other clients (bitch). Mean while I'm a virus like ""Iverson"". A nigga ""cross-over"" Europeans and Myaran. And the soldiers retiring. I ain't buying motherfuckers acting like they denying him. Who trying a nigga whose view's biased. I figure your crews tired. My trigger introduces ""violence"" (dudes through sirens). You want to spittle Orange Juice and Vitamins. [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. Oh...I have you yelling' out when I bag the ""30/30 Rifle"". Oh...To late for niggaz to get religious and start reading they Bible. Oh...See you get down like other niggaz you be in that dirty cycle. Oh...See you should make peace instead of making me become a psycho. [Verse 3]. A daralent co-inherent hustle. My heritage married the street struggle. Like a couple of great aunt's ago (yeah). So this blood streams through my nuts. Seems like I wasn't like I wasn't in touch. When the teacher had spoke (NO!). Now I was just a preacher in 'O. Seat on the bleachers and flip ""coke"". The only reaching that got threw my dome. Niggaz gamble so they gat outta be chrome. Pulled the winning raffle so. I scramble with the track and the foams. Fuck an act and a clone. This is actual happenings that's factual, back in my home. This is rap, but I ain't rapping so you clap in the ""zone"". Think you're trapped in the act for the sake of performing. This is your warning, run upon them wrong. And your tissue was burning a hundred degrees more!. 'O Trizzy gone. My nigga ""Bust"" bring the hook back in for 'em. (Come On). [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. Oh...I have you yelling' out when I bag the ""30/30 Rifle"". Oh...To late for niggaz to get religious and start reading they Bible. Oh...See you get down like other niggaz you be in that dirty cycle."
out of state,"[Verse 1]. Roll out, straight to the ATL. Coming from the DET gotta bail. Gotta get mail in adbundance. Stat watch that yay on the oven. Nigga this hustlin'. Had enough gettin' nothing. Cooped in the ??. Gotta get accustomed. So I push that dust, that's me crushin'. Push that new stank ugly,. Snowflakes in the hood like flurries,. Nigga so urgently, gotta earn that cheese, affirmatively,. The firm with me gotta, turn the keys of a 64 fever,. So eager, go re-up, get cheese on the old school beeper,. No two-ways, no feds, only way a nigga get head get bread,. Stay low-pro, no po-po, no hoes in the spot where the dope grow. [Bridge]. We, got to get this paper dog anywhere it takes,.

Dippin' now, in the CAL, get Dre on the phone,. Gotta put that fluff on hold, homegrown, holmes know,. Bubonic chronic gots to move on it soon as possible. Honest, U-Hauls, movin' by two anonymous drivers. Reclinin', just a couple of folks reload from the West to the East coast,. Gotta get that dough, flip them bows, get back to the 'Mo like pronto. With guacemole, niggaz can't grow these, got it where they make nacho,. Not so? Taste that, wipe the Ajax off that plastic wrap,. Look at him now, his eyes saggin' like my Dickie khaks,.

Be,fore you see a nigga like myself break, even, if it means that we rollin' outta state!. Gotta get it at a good rate, get bucks, come home with the weight up!"
outro,"Eminem: Verse 1]. Nawww.....we ain't done. I love being hated, it's great it, let's me know that I made it. I wouldn't have it no other way, I wouldn't trade it for the world. Only lets me know that im loved by so many other mother fuckers. That hate you in this buzz, you keep fuckin wit us, we keep fuckin you up. And keep pulling the rug from up under you, and what's even more fucked up. Is we enjoy doing what were doing so much. There aint nothing that we love more than pulling your skirts up. And exposin you hoes so much people are starting to wonder. Whats up with the fuckin ""Wonder Woman"" underalls. Do onto others as you will have done onto you. So who the fuck you mothafuckas gonna run to. When someone runs up wit a mask and puts a gun to you. You will ask yourself how come your mans didn't empty the last round that he had. In ""Curtis Jackson's"" ass while he had the chance. You keep asking us to keep it on wax, but we cant. This is past any rationalization. We have captured national media attention. Conversation is senseless you can sense the tension. Start building soon as we enter the ""106 and Park"" building. Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to god if someone so much as even. Touches one of my people I'll put a million on his head. And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it. But I rather rap than get into this gangsta shit. And it aint because I'm a bitch it's cuz I aint a bitch. I don't endanger people that I'm with, I'm a general. I aint ""Bush"" I don't send my soldiers to war if I aint there.

You get bombed like Lebanon with (*explosion*). On tactic, I'll snatch your head like one Saddam's men. [Obie Trice: Verse 3]. Mathafucka I'll handle you, we can have it out on any avenue. An ""Average Man"", flipped into an animal. Shoot out ya mandibles, cannons and ammunition reload. With precision nigga know the mechanicals. Break the Pistol down you should see them handles. The streets taught the child no read up manuals. Pushing crack valves, young ""Nino Brown"". Chasing ""Green"" is the dream when you're young and brown.. Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now. A ""Dozen Dirty"" niggaz and they all get down.. I'll solve any problem that enlarge when I was (??). [Kuniva: Verse 4]. While you punching' and tackling' punks. I'm handling' chumps, packing' the pump. That's longer than the elephant's trunk.. On the streets I'm ""the beast"" I'll feast. Upon the weak, so speak ""beef"". I'll shoot you and scream ""Increase the peace!"" (*explosion*). The monster, pistol packing', pushing' niggaz off they ""Hondas"". Stomp ya, get it cracking' yanking' bitches for they Ganja. Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mamma beat me enough. When she was sleeping and stuff. I was stealing the keys to the truck. Shut the fuck up! Before you end up dead in the dump truck. Or in the streets taking a nap bleeding and locked up. You want what? Like ""M Bleak"" with this Heat. If your ten deep, then fuck it'll be ten asleep (*gunshots*). [Proof: Verse 5]. Don't mess with my alasnke, don't tussle with my aspe. Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed. We ferocious, toast don't host us. Approach us, through heat straight from the shoulders. We the soldiers ya the youngster's. Youngsta's among, arn't ya dead in the dumpsta. Say to the monsta head full of drama. You scared of the truama vomit to monsta. (Woof!) I'm back nigga, (Poof!) I reappear. Shoot like (*boom*) you ain't seeing clear. Blackness, carcass, cover with catfish. We merkers with no purpose other than practice. [Bizarre: Verse 6]. There are three things I hate: liars, fakes, and cheaters;. Alcoholics, and sluts, and fuckin wife beaters. I guess that describes my life,. I don't even know whose song this is? (*Obie Trice*). Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip-hop. At my release party in a pink tank top and Reebok's. This ""Ja Rule"" beef im not getting in, i need an R&B singer to sing at my wedding (Say Yeah!). I'll turn your face into a fuckin' meat patty. I'll fuck yo mommy and go fishing with yo granny. I'll shit on you; I'll pee on R. Kelly too,."

Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home. Pick up two big ..... Girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid!. So when I pull up in that benz. Don't try to pretend you ain't interested.

That's my motives, jumpin' off in rovers. All white, like I was right up in the dakotas. Or minnesota, did I mention soda?. When it's mixed with viola, watch my cup runneth over. Cut from a soldier.

Like a prosthetic third leg let it go. This is Shady 1.0 Em let 'em know. I still profit through the process. The prize in my jeans my balls'll never digress. I'm a dick that I brag about.

And you just wanna fuck me - our secret creepin. . These niggaz think they bitch ain't cheatin. She in the club every week deceivin them. Hangin out with Toneisha and them. All in V.I.P. tryin to meet a new G with them. Yeah nigga, yo' relationship right. But your bitch got a dick on the side. You fell in love so she know what you about. You don't get her high, always on time. She need a nigga that's gon' fuck her brains out. Send her home, put her pussy in your mouth. Niggaz get comfortable, fall in love. They don't wanna fuck no mo', they cuddlin up. But see your wife is a slut, she's just tryin to nut. She wanna get rammed but her man ain't the one. So on the other hand she plan to get done. By a nigga who tell a lil' some'n some'n like. . Don't get mad at Obie. This is, harsh reality your broad's a freak. She wanna get it in wit'cha homie. Trust me, behind your back this week.

Catch him up, naw, but you seen what you saw. That nigga say ""It wasn't me"". He gets puss like around the clock. Wife ain't watchin niggaz bouncin on the twat. Even Peter boy diggin it out. All on the countertops drillin the trout. Fucked up thing babe it's your bridesmaid. This ain't J. Springer, this is Obie. . Nigga had his share of broads involved. But when they hit the gan' they just start to bawl. They say, ""I don't know why I got your balls in my jaws. My man take care of the fam, no flaws"". No psychiatric visit bitch can help ya. You just like dicks in your throat, helpless. Niggaz come through, beat up your pelvis. Then you run back to whom think you precious. At home she like Aunt Jemima. All alone she like anacondas. Your man want answers, why play me dishonest?. Then he seek counsellin to keep Pocahontas. Niggaz pokin holes in there homie, be honest. You got a hoe fo' sho' for a Madonna. Dudes don't recognize the drama. 'til another nigga get his thighs, got her and tell her"
shit hits the fan,"OBIE TRICE (f/ Dr. Dre, Eminem) LYRICS. . . [Dr. Dre]. Yeah. Yo, let's bring it. [Chorus - Eminem]. What you gonna do when shit hits the fan. Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?. Will you be as hard as you say you are?. Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?. I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?. Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?. And show us you're as hard as you say you are?. Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?. [Verse 1 - Dr. Dre]. Niggaz is so gangsta, Niggaz is thugs. Niggaz'll spend their whole life peddlin drugs. Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able. To own their own label and give the game up. Some niggaz came up, some just didn't. That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't. Some niggaz'll get money and pay niggaz to back em. So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough. And that's as backwards, cuz them niggaz just gone keep coming back. And that's when extortion happens. You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be. You deal with anything to live legitimately. But you gone find if you do get in this industry. It's best to be business with me than against me. Niggaz get behind mics and ain't even MC's. Niggaz get on MTV just to diss me. This shit don't even piss me off. I'm laughin all the way to the bank. Watchin the satellite from a Bentley. You niggaz don't even got a car. You're so far under my radar. I don't even know who the fuck you are. To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin. I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin. The media just feeds into these feuds. Tryin to add fuel to the fire. This little nigga, Ja Rule. Talking bout he's gonna slap me. Nigga please. You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees. I laugh at these magazines when they interview em. All they doin is making fake threats to us through em. And pussy you're not Pac, I knew em. Pac was a real nigga, you just a fuckin insult to em. It's too bad we had to fallout before he passes. If he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin your ass. You're talkin to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years. Who you got in your ear? I don't even gotta say it, the fans know. Quit tryin to be tough, nigga, you look like a asshole. [Chorus - Eminem]. [Verse 2 - Obie Trice]. They say why don't we increase the peace. The only peace increased is that which deletes your peeps. Cuz niggaz run mouths but they don't run streets. Till that 4 5 will cease the speech. Yeah it's a shame how the beef'll creep. Could've reached the peep, now you're left with a horrible leak. I'm tryin to be as bleak with my speech as possible. Just in case a nigga tryin to throw me an obstacle. Nigga, I'm not boxin you, I'm hospitable. I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you. Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?. You back on the streets? I send another hit at you. This is not a hypocritical issue. I will critical condition your tissue. Give a fuck if all ten of them wit you. I throw an extra ten of them missiles. Turn gangstas into gentlemen vicko. And ever since Eminem dissed you. I swear I see the women and bitch in you. All this bickering back and forth over who signs who. Curtis, pull your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered. Now take it like a man and shake it off. Damn. And quit tellin all these magazines your plans. How you gone slap up my mans, you're ficticious. Nigga, we send Stan to come murder your bitches. [Chorus - Eminem]. Hahahahahaha. Yeah, yeah. Go out behind all the gangstas you want, nigga. Matter fact, go get every gangsta from every hood. In the United States of America to back you, nigga. Ain't nobody rap wit you. You can't see that?. Fell off, nigga. Hahahahahaha. Damn, damn. Shady slash Aftermath, motherfucker. 2003 to infin. ."

spill my drink,"[Intro]. Yeah.... Let me get right. Muh'fuckers poppin at me. Baby mama say I can't, be the pappy all this propaganda. with my family. E'rything I got wasn't hand to me. Had to hit the block so gradually became the man I be (be, be). Sorry that my pop wasn't a man to me. Had to opt for different boyfriends my mammy handed me. Performin mammograms on her while I play Atari. Scarred me, horribly, horribly [sips drink]. Lock that thought out, but at times I lose perspective. No disrespect but I was forced to think reckless. In and out of courts for usin illegal methods. Guess them poor choices left us disconnected. The one who points the finger got four for pointin back. Nothin can come between us, I'm hopin you knowin that. And if I let you down can't keep holdin it on my back. I gotta stay focused where my sanity's at, sanity's at. [Chorus]. Dodgin all these darts in my thoughts I seek. Can't let these people spill my drink. I'ma mob like a boss 'til I'm off in my casket's reach. Won't let these niggaz spill my drink. I'm ridin through the city sippin Henny with my thoughts in sync. Can't let these niggaz spill my drink. To my niggaz gettin money still hungry tryin to stay on your feet. Don't let these niggaz spill yo' drink (drink, drink). E'rybody lookin at me, like the boy lookin scraggly. Since he ain't with Shady like, e'rything collapsed behind me. A contract don't define me. It just reminds me that I'm givin up my paper to sign me. And with the dismay of my record release delay I. See who was close, somehow they slipped away now. Price to pay when you ball then get on your A.I.. Crossover was cold, now O's under the radar. To e'rything I cherish gotta be re-established. All cause the marriage didn't succeed, it perished. The characters I used to feed all vanished. Left me on my knees, bleedin with no bandages. No gauze when I fall, but even through it all. I handled this way to ball, mechanics is. Kept at a hundred, them other niggaz is amateurs. Guess that's the law of averages - eww. [Chorus]. So even when you're dreamin and I'm, intervenin demons. Get to, workin on your inner bein, let 'em know you see 'em. When the G that's within got ya, infra-red schemin. Keep me in your head instead, you don't need to bleed 'em. Cause a boat with no anchor is a boat that's gon' sail. You don't even need them folks, all's well. May they all burn in hell, cause when all else fails. You the truth, your blue glass won't spill.

Where we give a shout out to my School Craft Playaz. Detroit's in the house, live at Roll-in-Wills. Obie Trice baby, check it out.... [Verse 1]. I done did my share of dirt, flipped my share at work.

With all that ignorant shit you do.... Niggaz need money and I do too.... That's why I ain't fucking with you.... [Verse 2]. ""I wonder would he pass"" for passer. If amance ass kick's inflected. It can happen that quick, when spittin' shit. Rapidly laying down you fag ass click. From running your lips like a bitch. All I know is something gotta give. Niggaz I gotta live, it's not a poragative. Don't speak on ""The Kid"". Lid your speach or rid you in the streets. It's so optional, but I will be logical. Cause when I lodge at you, it's not hospital. Operating poppin' them hot slugs outta your abdominal. Now your momma got a funeral attendin'. Just for mentioning Obie Trice the Henchmen. All I wanna do is make music and ""Bench"" man. Lift my weigth up the same shit that ""Jay"" said.. Push your hate up, the AK's is spraying. Motherfuckers ain't Playing!!! (*AK sound*). [Chorus: Kon Artist]. When I was down you had a lot to say.... You's in my business and walk away.... Talk about, then try to find a way.... Spread yo shit 'round town.... I ain't really got time for you.... With all that ignorant shit you do.... Niggaz need money and I do too.... That's why I ain't fucking with you.... [Verse 3]. That's why I don't fuck with you ""kats"". Cause this all wrap with ya'll. But this is not an act at all. Run ya'll trap, get clapped and fall. Spread moments, recieve ligatendons. Don't confuse music with us chosen. Adhesive patches won't cover the bruise. Channel ""Two Eight"" won't cover the news. They never give a fuck when it's beef between crews.. All I know is Obie paid his dues. Made his moves and bitch niggaz hate the truth. They rather see me laying in that body booth.. ""Deep Six"" rotten so the rats can chew. That's why I don't fuck with ya'll. Run and get ya'lls and thats really sucks for ya'll. Talk behind backs but never to him dawg. Wouldn't that irritate your boss.. [Chorus: Kon Artist]. When I was down you had a lot to say.... You's in my business and walk away.... Talk about, then try to find a way.... Spread yo shit 'round town.... I ain't really got time for you.... With all that ignorant shit you do.... Niggaz need money and I do too.... That's why I ain't fucking with you.... When I was down you had a lot to say.... You's in my business and walk away.... Talk about, then try to find a way.... Spread yo shit 'round town.... I ain't really got time for you.... With all that ignorant shit you do.... Niggaz need money and I do too.... That's why I ain't fucking with you.... [Outro]."

This is my life, the block or your Magnum-voxs. The synopsis, clogs my logic. You wanna be mobsters. Roll on a roster like we's imposters. Like we's in D needs to be stopped. Like we don't bleed and breathe hip-hop, and so they knock us. But this accomplishment is far more fetch than one's knowledge. It's impossible, we will never be stopped. Shady's inevitable, our heavy influence in medley crew. Who grew from a old school's point of view. Earn from the best, learn to play chess with words. The circumstances sayin we herbs. But that's aight, Soundscan sayin we word. And I'm pronouncin numbers, I ain't never in my life heard. And you ain't gotta touch it, fuck it, say I'ma puppet. I hit the public, motherfuckers love it. Obie Trice 2003, summer, newcomer, I'm comin. Bump me in your buckets (fuck it)"

the set up,"[Intro]. Bitch I see you, bitch you know I know you. Yeah, I know you.. [Verse 1]. Last time I saw you, you was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck. Last time you saw me I was PI to the mothafuckin MP what!. And lately I heard you's a broke bitch living in the lower class suburbs. And lately the word is I live in the suburbs and I don't fuck with birds. She used to pump on the block sell a nigga rocks bail a nigga out BUT. She tried to plot on a nigga vacant lot one shot bitch died go figure.. He used to pay this bitch gave her lots of shit fucks wrong with this nigga man. He used to bring her through the hood treat the bitch to fuckin good my opinion. We used to blaze with the bitch faded off the lick she x-rayed the clip. This nigga bought braids for the bitch Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucka shit. Meanwhile in the hood she driving around good this bitch thinks she in Hollywood. Meantime she setting a nigga up telling us for the stuff she's ready to get him stuck WHAT. [Chorus: Nate Dogg and (Obie)]. Thick thighs but she full of surprises, I swear this bitch is shady. (It's what I know). Sex on her mind all the time and you think that that's your baby. (You don't know). You a good guy that's living a lie but she dove and played your safety. (It's what I know). If you cool and she satisfied how come that bitch just paged me.. (You don't know). [Verse 2]. We had to ride on a nigga WATCH HIM for the right time to get richer. We decided when the hit was, run up on him, 45 in the ribs what.. This nigga screamed like a bitch. Showed him what his shit had a hell of a lick, BUT. The bitch who told us bout the bricks exposed us to the nigga knew that would come BUT. Meanwhile when its good this nigga suited up. And timbed looted up rims and a new trucks your man living it up. Then a van with no hubs suddenly pulled up and erupt. shot a nigga the fuck up. Just my luck, the bitch got us both touched. Its like a rush.. The bitch who blushed and smoked blunts wit us turned out to be nuts switched up. Mixed up wit the wrong slut. Got my friend zipped up in a bag its all bad. My niggaz got my back in fact they caught on her ave flossing in another nigga cab. [Chorus: Nate Dogg and (Obie)]. Thick thighs but she full of surprises, I swear this bitch is shady. (It's what I know). Sex on her mind all the time and you think that that's your baby. (You don't know). You a good guy that's living a lie but she dove and played your safety. (It's what I know). If you cool and she satisfied how come that bitch just paged me.."
there they go,"[Obie Trice]. Yeah!. Aye Em you ready?. Herk, you got them thangs nigga?. You know. Detroit City. [Obie Trice & Eminem]. There they go. Those D-Town boys, carry the calico. Whenever there's war, you gots to know. Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'. Detroit make noise everywhere that we go. There they go, there they go. [Obie Trice]. You are not convincin'. When Detroit blocks stay flocked with henchman. Niggas get popped for instance. Infrared dot for distance. Get knocked by the cops, cop on some pension. Straight detention, a nigga doin' tension. Once released, he on that music business. Been viewin' 106 in them cafeterias. Only to find that rap's actually serious. Deliriously so it's back to crack and vigilance. Same shit to send them up in Michigan. Us is pimpin', a difference from any city I've visited. It's that Detroit spirit and if we in it. Ballin' out to the end, period. Use O as the reference to that sentence. The message I'm sendin', you best just pay attention. [Obie Trice & Eminem]. There they go. Those D-Town boys, carry the calico. Whenever there's war, you gots to know. Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'. Detroit make noise everywhere that we go. There they go, there they go. [Big Herk]. If you don't like how I act then blow me. I don't really give a shit, I represent the real cats who know me. Man what's up with that scratch you owe me. Now run my chips before we fall out like Shaq and Kobe. Big Herk on a track with Obie. When you come to the D, it's cut throat, better be packin' homie. And niggas get they shit split for actin' phony. We're known for the glocks and the choppers. These niggas will rob you, leave you standin' in ya socks and ya boxers. We got real g's and lots of imposters. I smoke the real trees, see I cop from the rosters. Y'all niggas ain't impress me yet. Y'all yappin', not rappin', turn that shit off and press eject. See we known for the car shows, runnin' from the narcos. Keep them bottles comin', we gon' pop 'em till the bar close. CHORUS [Obie Trice & Eminem]. There they go. Those D-Town boys, carry the calico. Whenever there's war, you gots to know. Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'. Detroit make noise everywhere that we go. There they go, there they go, there they go. There they go, there they go, there they go. Those D-Town boys, carry the calico. Detroit make noise everywhere that we go. [Eminem]. Meat cleaver, leave a gash in a bitches ass. She had dreams of being an R&B singer. Diva, leave her face cut up from the waist of me. what a waste of a pretty face. And this place ain't just safe, it's just straight gangster. It ain't just New York or LA that bangs no more. There's latin cown kings here, Southside folk. Eastside them gangs and nothin' but gang lands and. Spray paint cans and when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancin'. That window rolls down and that trey .8's dancin'. And them shooters don't miss homie, man they hate chancin'. It's straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and. get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue dodge flashin'. Red and blue lights, no ambulance you got flattened. And this was not supposed to be no Detroit anthem. But just so you know if you see them D-Boyz passin'. Chorus"
ups and downs,"I've been up, and I've been down. And I had this world kick me around. But I bounce back, now take a look at me now. Say I don't trust them, I don't trust them hoes. I see my dreams in front of me unfold. And this crazy world is oh so cold. And to my seed, let the story be told. Never did trust them, I don't trust them hoes. . Yea; they back-stab ya, with no malice. Rat bastards, grown men turn faggots. You could shake a nigga hand 'til your palm get calluses. Calculate grams with 'em, tally up math and he. Still turn around and leave you stiff, paralysis. If we was parallel this possibly wouldn't happen. It would just be a myth. And all that envious shit wouldn't exist. Since this stimulates some niggaz to spit. I let 'em smell the stench when a nigga's pushin the six. We could take it to that extent, wait a minute, let 'em vent. Vicious niggaz incubators, shit could made it then. Replace them with real gentlemen. These feminine faggots shouldn't have been on this planet. They send the niggaz upstate to they grandpappy's. Puttin nothin past these tattlin bastards. [Chorus]. There you got groupie chicks goin at him. Fabricatin what happened, just to platinum they clothes. It's a patter-n, they want you to man-handle 'em. 'til they ass exposed. Put you on the news, she a nuisance. It take two to tango but she don't think so. Hoes is abusive so I drink slow. I realize the future when I mingle. Hoes set you up, so rough they. Forget the hoe they were. They focus on false shit what didn't occur. Deceive detectives, statements are blurred. Reversin what virtually happened with her. Her don't trust. Baby we just had a burr. She willingly lift up her skirt, Your Honor. [Chorus]. . Now see this industry's risky if you ain't 50. They don't mark your dollars. You see Interscope's iffy, if he sell less than. Multi-million dollar copies they drop him. See, Jimmy's watchin. If he, purchase my product. O might have options, show progress. Longest most y'all coppin. The nonsense is opposite of him. Props givin when the projects shows profit. This process is hard for most artists. If he ain't targetted as what's poppin. This is not O. Trice's problem. Real name, no gimmicks, get it regardless. Steel guard up, don't trust A&R's cause. If they knew music we'll be much farther. [Chorus]"
violent,"[Thug] There he go right there, got this nigga. What's up Obie?. [gun fire]. [Obie] Oh shit. [gun fire]. [Thug] Uh, uh, uh nigga. Yeah nigga, shit. [car pulls away]. Obie Trice. [Chorus]. You can catch me in the hood, up to no good. With that Mac like right beside me. I ain't by no niggaz eyeing my figures. Deprive me of my life, try me. I'ma rip up tissue, homie I won't miss you. This'll be the day that ya dying. Nigga I'm violent. Ya hearing the sirens, once that ass silence. For fucking with me, nigga I'm violent. Cause I'm so tired of these wannabe riders trying to touch Obie. Cause nigga I'm violent. [1st verse]. Hat match the jacket, jack match the glove. Glove match the Mac that send niggaz above. All black when his faggot ass acts up. When the boys interrupted haters can't wait to duck. Cause when I buck I leave a peep hole in his face. They peep O in the place then they get a bad taste. In they mouth, running his lip, I pull that ouch off my hip. Commence to spit, I'm too grown for this. But they tend to take you back to when you're known for riff raff. That'll be his ass, fucking with this cat. [Chorus]. [2nd verse]. They say O calm ya nerve, but some niggaz need to be served. Cause it's purpose is unheard of. Blacks done seen too much murder to flirt with death. Guess he feels it ain't nuthin left. That's when the weapon is taking it's last breath. If he think for a second he taking me outta my flesh. Violent when it comes to putting Obie to rest. Natural cause is the only way they say he left. Not from no hater, I got too many guns. So, when it come to that shit, I'm off one nigga. [Chorus]. [3rd verse]. Incompacitating O, no, I'm so. Observational I recognize you ho's. Nocturnal mufuckas knocking ya mans. Cause I'm sitting on paper bigger then Shaq hands. Plus every chance I get Obie advance. From spitting to getting riches, I'm so enhanced. On bitch ass niggaz trying to slow my plans. Realest shit a nigga ever spoke to fans. Listen, I'm taking kites in the pen. A nigga ever offend again, and that's on my kid"
wake up,"They say he was a monster from birth, so. Fuck it, I'll just a lean warn-os them hoes. I suppose O took on the street life. Even though my mother told me I could be otherwise. Wasn't the school type, I was too cool. My agenda wasn't general education, nigga. Generalizing Obie's expectations. It was like, a cucoo in twenty-twos. Bad news my nigga, pass the brew. Cause in a week we be pouring a glass for you. So rapidly homies become causualties. We was just playing Madden. Now a nigga sad for his family, that's how it happens. Dudes get blasted, another casket. Another child becomes a fatherless bastard. Make a nigga wanna grab this rachet. It's so tragic, and Obie can't get past it. And you wonder why a nigga'll flash it. Just to, show these demons that I ain't having it. Put 'em beneathe the grass in a flash. Homie I'm from the craft. And to make it where I'm at, that's called Soldierism. Real niggaz notice em, they wanna flow with 'em. Wanna do major shows with 'em. Get the fuck out the ghetto wit 'em. Heavy metal, leave a nigga twisted, don't fret. This is the set we live in. But I ain't crying or whining about my enviornment. Even though black folk is dying constant. Niggaz'll shoot you unconscious. Wit no conscience, until you lose conscience. Conscious, and pompous white folk think I'm just rhyming. Just designing lines, just for the sake of shining. Like I just speak violent applying to the business I'm in. Rewind and find him in a dirty ass hood with no sight of climbing. Moving on up was just The Jeffersons. Rest of us watching the tube got less then them. So why you vexing him? Why you stretching him out?. He got the weapon all because his whereabouts. Born and raised, mental slaves. And I don't see change before I'm seeing the grave. All I see is my homies corpse decay. Crying at his wake, can't recognize his face. Face it, you not identifying with me. My identity distorts ya visibility. So you can't see me, peep what he's achieving. You recieve information from TV. I'm in the hood, I live it you read about it. Rest in peace Peezy. Please believe Obie eyes've seen The Wire. Prior to what you seeing on the screen. I done been in and out of the bing. Lost niggaz to unfortunate things. That's why, praise the Lord I'm still on the scene. Praise the Creator who made human beings. Just for creating a nigga like me. A nigga that put the umph in G, yeah. [Chorus 2X]. Wake up. I try to reach out but you won't. Wake up. My brothers and sisters, we got to. Wake up. 'Fore you stuck in the system, and then ya. Wake up. Reality hits ya, before you can. Wake up"
wanna know,"Since they wanna know. Since they wanna know. I said since they wanna know. Here's the formula on O, now lets go. {All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt}. Since they wanna know. {All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt}. Since they wanna know. Second rounds on me. Obie Trice. Emil hit em, let's go. [1st verse]. Ob Trice, the giant, standing a 5'8'' stature. Back with a second album, supplying ya Fear Factor. But Joe ain't the host my nigga, you have the access to the most. Noted flow on Shady's faction. And I ain't being cocky, if so accept my apology. Except, know I process my thoughts logically. First weeks sales tops the toll from tsunami. But haters like the L, it's the white boy behind me. But you couldn't inhale a flow that's more grimey. It would still prevale if another label sign me. Obie so timely, must Obie remind em. The first nigga to shine solo from the place ya find em. Native Detroiter, ghetto reporter, hit you wit some. Heavy metal for supporting what ya caught us. A little something different from the homie from Michigan. Basically, Obie's ripping on any instrument he's given, come on. [Chorus]. {All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt}. Since they wanna know. {All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt}. Since they wanna know. {End what's right and ??}. Since they wanna know. {All I want is what's mine I don't care who I hurt}. Since they wanna know. [2nd verse]. Four niggas in a whip. All foes say they ain't fucking with Trice shit. Somebody's lying, I'm undenying, denying me means that. The driver got influence over you on certain things. Be destinguished, just cuz you ain't feeling his favorite emcee. Don't mean you speak no English. Hop out the car, catch the bus. At least you be established as the man that you are. I hate to take it so far and so tedious. But niggas bleed like bitches, I'm truly believing this. Once a month, they wake up with a Obie tampon. Inserted in they nuts, give em the flux cuz my bucks is up. And no this ain't eBay, so please be easy. Gotta be delusional to think Obie is losing yo. Let em get a whiff of some shit, they quick to abuse it though. [chorus]. [3rd verse]. Peep what O's selling when I hit em with Van Halen. But it's just a man from the ghetto rebelling. Rebel without a cause, cause I'm in them Superman drawers. Running around the shack momma had us living. Now ya mans living a inch from truly killing em. A dude or ambition, a gift, given from the man who invented em. When the system Scrooged just like Lil Tim and em. Will bless the child who manuevers the censors, then. Spitting venom, have them same dudes interested in him. My visions unlimited, music's my outlet, I rock a outfit. For all the foul shit I witnessed, make it my business. To get a listener of one, clear description. If you hearing them, you would catch what I'm pitching. Guarantee to serve your addiction, c-c-come on"
we all die one day,"[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Niggas Know what I'm about out here. I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to. You can run your mouth I don't care. But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you. It's too real out here to be scared. A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to. A man is the last thing you should fear. It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you. We all die one day. [Obie Trice]. Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look. Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook. Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and. Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand. I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga'z moms. Shoot up clubs and destroy nigga'z vibes. Everybody running for their motherfucking lives. Tough club niggaz, we leave early, cock back surely. Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave. Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z. O's an animal skirts get mirked. Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt. Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard. Trust in ""God"" it cause you're about to catch a bullet scar. I give a fuck where you from who you be with. Keep this a secret right by the nuts. A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Niggas Know what I'm about out here. I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to. You can run your mouth I don't care. But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you. It's too real out here to be scared. A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to. A man is the last thing you should fear. It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you. We all die one day. [Lloyd Banks]. But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks. And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks. Poverty will make your ass bet on words. Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish their last sends'. They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun. If that's the case then get a bigger one. You don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out of the hood. That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump. I where a white mink, the fabric is done. Got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them. Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from. Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come. I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains. I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane. You should be easy on my name, cause I don't going back and forth. Your boss and your captain's soft (Bitch). [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Niggas Know what I'm about out here. I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to. You can run your mouth I don't care. But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you. It's too real out here to be scared. A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to. A man is the last thing you should fear. It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you. We all die one day. [Eminem]. Cause we gonna bring it to anybody who want it. You want it? you gonna get it. Name 'em we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out. Too much venom and if you role with 'em. We gonna fuck you up with 'em. I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose. My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BOOM). You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through. G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins. Ski masks and gloves consider this as a warning. Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs. But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up. We are not killers; my vato will have you shot though. Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario. Little sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real. We burn source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill. Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still. Shady records you better believe the hype is real. This is no joke, I don't smoke. But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin ""P.O."" choke. I'm an OG; you're fuckin with a GI Joe. Bia Bia, mia meo a Vida loco. I'm a psycho, Mariah aint got shit on me. When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people. A tent siege on her ranch, huddled up next to her. With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs. You ever had your cat pealed back or your shit pushed in. I put my blade in your like a fucking pin cushion. Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dogg. I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog. Nobody told you that I'm loco essay?. I lack every sane chemical in my membrane. I'm slim sha...dy and the ""D"" is for deez nuts. And you can get each one for free so feast up. I pee in a cup for three months; I'm having an E party for Easter please come. [50 Cent]. We gonna bring it to anybody who want it. You want it? you gonna get it. You name 'em we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out. Too much venom and if you role with 'em. We gonna fuck you up with 'em. You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest. I got a 12 gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest. Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest. Fear me like you fear god cause I bring death. Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle. I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down. I watch gangster flicks and root for the bad guy. And turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die. If you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to. So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new. You can raise your voice like you fending to touch something. When I raise my knife shit I'm fending to cut something. See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie. If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me. (Ha-ha Sorry Kim ha-ha). [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Niggas Know what I'm about out here. I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to. You can run your mouth I don't care. But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you. It's too real out here to be scared. A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to. A man is the last thing you should fear. It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you."
we ride for shady,"[Obie Trice:]. We run this shit, fo-five on the hip. Been ridin' for Shady..... [Cashis:]. Cashis 'n' O, Shady Records. The dream team.... [Verse 1: Cashis]. Sittin' in the back of the, all gray Accura. Gun to the passenger, for acting tough. Scatter wheel in the passin, Harder than assasin. Plus I'm on the draw-down, quick as fuck,. Last move 'fore I give all street shit up. Put a nigga in the ground, face down, feet up. This nigga here tried to cuff me for my Re-Up. When I went to his crib he called police up. Now you on your way to being pimp paplega. For sending messages through bitches like, 'You gon' see us'. Shady! Cash, king of the dope-fiends, plus. Can move a square mile by blocks 'till I'm creamed up. Take the bullet out of Obie head, put it in my pistol and use it. As ammunition on the niggas that hit, fam. I got to war on the regular, man. Cause I'm part of the dream team, you a regular man. Force rap, I don't see no competitors, and. You see things like me, when my metal run hand. I'm a state case boy with a federal plan. And huntin' them beats, beatin' the shit out skinheads. I'm the spirit of a G, bringin' lyrics to the street. I'm Cashis, a real dope boy on the beat. Slumped in the seat, tucked, clutchin' the heat. Basically, you niggas can't fuck with me. [Chorus: Cashis]. We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip,. 'Bout to ride for Shady. Y'all niggas ain't hard, y'all niggas ain't real. Y'all niggas ain't crazy. Bring it on if you want, you don't know the homicides. That I've done lately. We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip. 'Bout to ride for Shady. [Verse 2: Obie Trice]. Yeah, Trice is back on the Alchy track. With Cashis, capitalising on this mic, in fact. We fuckin' with the captain of rap, my nigga with the Nike cap. Keep the cottonoid in quite exact. So I'm luring you cats into the second class act. Where maturing's the number uno asset, as yet. Who's the pastor, driver, O. Trice. The flow to die for and death blow survive. I echo through your external vibe. With internal experiences I've acquired. I'm probably the most honest Hip-Hopper alive. A victim, depicting images from my own eyes. Never livin' through holmes, why. Homie got his own set of stand-up cahoonas, stand-up guy. It's Cashis, O. Tri', rappers we blow by. This is as accurate as the masses will have it, no lie. (nigga!)"

well known asshole,"[Chorus] - (Scratched). (I am in fact, unbelivable). The name's Obie Trice, the well known asshole. (I be what I wanna, shut yer fuckin' mouth child child). [Verse One]. Aiyo, its massive now, Obie Trice is now here. So all weak mutherfuckers step to the rear. My techniques been sweet since I was a embryo. On tour fetus. And at birth who could belive this?. 8 pounds, 3 ounce, child could move a crowd. And have my music blisteratin' through systems loud. Turning partys out wit a cup of Guinness stout. Talk shit, knocked out, what a thug all about. Without a doubt I brings terror, sex changing MC's. Put 'em out there (?) mascara (meh meh). clever wit ryhmes, its like whateva wit mine. Talk shit, get smacked unlimited times. I'm known to focus, get the buzz like the locust. An' Obie is the dopest Nigga. [Chorus] (with variations). [Verse Two]. I flip birds, like dimonique dogs flips ass. Jack ma dick wen i sit in hot baths. Roll with raw dawgs, I'm ready to rock. I been settin down shit since the hiohop shop. In ma block nuttin but thugs mean dogs. 40 cal slug, broken 40 ounces of bud. To suds, (?) the floor, you niggaz want more?. catch me on tour at your local record store. The ""o"" the finest, Nap entertainment the finest. Who told that lie that obie wasn't the grimiest?. [Chorus] (with variations). [Verse Three]. Verse 3, I thought this rap game would never curse me. Leave on the service, dyin, hungry an' thirsty?. Take yo' mind, like I took yer girl virginity. And leave clips empty on any nigga that tempts me. Moss, show me tracks so I can ride in this thang. Whatevas left that we got thats undecided. Violent, hittin fifty states like a riot. Attracting crowds from newborns to those retired. Admire it an' let yer mans know. Its Obie Trice nigga, The Well Known Asshole. (I am in fact) The well known asshole. (scratched) Shut yer fuckin mouth child. (scratched) I am in fact, unbelivable. The name's obie trice the well known asshole. (scratched) Shut yer fuckin mouth child. (lemme show me back wit the way that I can demonstrate). (scratched) I am infact, unbelivable. The name's obie trice the well known asshole. {*variations of the above until end*}."
yo!,"[Obie Trice]. Yo, Obie Trice, yo. I'm with backdoor productions, no discussion,. O Trice be the sound that's rushin your eardrums. Pump it up if you feeling em, this is hip hop pure adrenaline. I'm a winner, I step on the scene. Start to cipher, bitches start to scream. Cock back, niggas start to flee. Ain't nobody in this motherfucker with me. I'm a dog, I walk what I talk. Detroit niggas see straight through your heart. Niggas wanna bark, niggas get traced in chalk. By the law in the adam car with this rap I be at em all. I spit through the mic and niggas just scatter off. The boss before that bitch rap that, these bitch made. Niggas get their shit pushed the fuck back. [Chorus: Repeat 2x]. You know O Trice spit the hot shit that's the realest. Keep lacing dope tracks that's the illest. Hot joints for my raw ass niggas. That make motherfuckers go yo. [Obie Trice]. Motherfuckers ain't trying to see Mr. Trice. Yo I pump up the party, pump nut up in ya wife. Me and you, two different types. You wanna be hardcore while my shit's precise. I recite make niggas wanna blast on any punk ass nigga in sight. My focus, to take niggas minds over. Somebody's murdered once my rhyme's over. I do this the regular way. A regular cat with an irregular verbal spray. You know my thoughts deep when it runs. A weirdo sleeping with mad guns. Who want some, you can have it, semi-automatic catch the trace around. You be lost and found. Chalked up with Obie Trice branded on ya ass nigga what."
