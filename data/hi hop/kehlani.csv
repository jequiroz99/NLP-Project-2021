intro,"[Intro: Reyna Biddy]. My condolences to anyone who has ever lost me. And, to anyone who got lost in me. Or, to anyone who ever felt they took a loss with me. My apologies for the misunderstanding or the lack thereof. I'm sorry you missed the God in me. And I'm sorry you missed the light. I'm sorry you forgot the way I arose like the moon. Night after night with the burden to forgive. Eager to feed you everything. See, I'm a holy woman. I know what it's like to give life to a being. without ever needing to press skin against one another. I've practiced how to hold my tongue long enough. I'm afraid I forgot to say goodbye. I'm afraid you're under the impression. That I was made to please you. I was under the impression you understood me better. The truth is, I'm a superwoman. And some days I'm an angry woman. And some days I'm a crazy woman. For still waiting, for still loving harder even if I'm aching. For still trusting that I'm still worth the most. For still searching for someone to understand me better"

Oh, if only you'd seen you walk away. Oh I'd follow you into yesterday. Then miles away. And I pray for the love that we had underneath. When we both promised not to waste love arguing. I love you more than I ever could say. And something about our exchange. It's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, or mine. And I never want to complain. Love you with your wings babe. These are your skies, your skies. And there was the blood from your heart. on my hands again. Though I swore I washed it out in the rain. And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry. That I don't know how to stay away. And don't say you don't want no problems. Can't hear through what I say. Say you want it your way. Always has been your way when it comes to me. Gun play, use my heart against me always. We can't seem to hold space. No way. The blood from your heart on my hands again. Though I swore I washed it off in the waves.

how we do us (feat. kyle dion),"[Verse 1: Kyle Dion and Kehlani]. Love shouldn't be defined. Love is one of a kind. What we do is crazy baby. All the ways you make me feel. The way you do me like that. The way you do me like that. We just understand what nobody else can. You know how to put it down. How to pick me up and never cause me stress. Every day's a rush. You always cracking jokes and always make me blush. I could stand the world if it was just us. Every day you love me so. Never let you go. When I say it's on you'll never tell me no. That's love baby. That's us baby. [Chorus: Both]. You know ain't explaining all this love we making. They think that we're crazy but it's us. Cause this is how we do us baby. This is how we do us baby. [Verse 2: Kehlani]. Don't you hate it when they get to asking all them questions 'bout the way we rockin'. Like, we gotta have a separate title or something. Gotta be on Tv like the idols or something. Cause baby boy this ain't no way that I could ever begin to explain. The way we love. The way we trust. The bond we have. It's just for us. Just for us. Telling me, yeah we're soul mates. I knew it ever since our very first date yeah. You the truth. I need the whole thing. But I won't risk putting this love at stake. For a simple explanation to a simple muthafucka. Who really don't know us. Really don't wanna. I mean it when I say it, that I only wanna love ya. That other shit is extra. Baby far above it now. I know sometimes I do a little much. I know sometimes you got a little problems with your trust. But that's love baby. That's us baby. [Chorus: Both]. [Bridge: Kyle Dion and Kehlani]. You're the only one I want and I can never leave your side. You're always here down to ride. You're always here and that's why. I fu-u-u-uck with you. Said he fucking with me cause I'm down.

in my feelings,"[Intro]. Are you putting her on your thing?. Oh my god, I'm gonna. It's gonna be like TMZ Kehlani TMZ (laughs). And then he's gonna be suing me for slander (laughs). [Intro]. If this isn't love, why do I feel this way?. [Verse 1]. Why you got me so obsessed with you?. Why you got me wasting time laying next to you?. Why do you tell me, ""Come over"". To watch you just stare at your phone?. Don't know why I expected you. To give me attention, affection and love. You're like a drug, never enough. Can't take you high, need a new plug. You got me bent, got me way too messed up. [Pre-Chorus]. And I don't know why I'm even still here. Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years.

[Verse 2]. Why you be doing me scandalous?. You just assume that I'm strong and can handle it. Why do you make me feel like I'm less than my worth. And it won't be for long, I ain't having it. You don't do the shit that you said would be done. You find it fun, to feel shit and run. Love like a gun, it leaves me stunned. Out on the floor and I just can't get up. [Pre-Chorus]. And I don't know why I'm even still here. Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years. And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you.

These are your skies, your skies. And there was the blood from your heart. on my hands again. Though I swore I washed it out in the rain. And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry. That I don't know how to stay away. And don't say you don't want no problems. Can't hear through what I say. Say you want it your way. Always has been your way when it comes to me. Gun play, use my heart against me always. We can't seem to hold space. No way. The blood from your heart on my hands again. Though I swore I washed it off in the waves. I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry. That I don't know how to stay away, stay away"

hold me by the heart,"[Intro]. When it comes to relationships, um. I truly feel like wholeness can come from brokenness. We can find love in the most strange places. Um, that we didn't expect. And I think that's the beauty in love. I think that's the beauty in connecting with other people. Through our hurt, through our growth. And through the struggle. Wasn't sure I'd be alright. Wasn't sure I'd be okay again. Didn't know how to take flight. Wings broken couldn't seem to bend. [Pre-Chorus]. Somehow you came and like the wind. And picked me up for good. And now I know what I have missed. I've been thinking that you should. [Chorus]. Pick up the pieces. Help me learn to stand. Lift me from the ground and use your hands. To hold me by the heart. Tell me I'll be whole again. Hold me by the heart. Tell me it will never end. 'Cause I've begun to think that. I was nothing short of broken. So baby, hold me by the heart (hold me by the heart). Help me fly again. Always read all the fairytales. Always knew that it would come. Through the pain I convinced myself. ""It's only magical for some"". [Pre-Chorus]. Somehow you came and like a prince. And picked me up for good. And now I know what I have missed. I'm thinking that you should. [Chorus]. Just pick up the pieces. Help me learn to stand. Lift me from the ground and use your hands. To hold me by the heart. Tell me I'll be whole again. And hold me by the heart. Tell me it will never end. 'Cause I've begun to think that.

intro,"[Intro: Reyna Biddy]. My condolences to anyone who has ever lost me. And, to anyone who got lost in me. Or, to anyone who ever felt they took a loss with me. My apologies for the misunderstanding or the lack thereof. I'm sorry you missed the God in me. And I'm sorry you missed the light. I'm sorry you forgot the way I arose like the moon. Night after night with the burden to forgive. Eager to feed you everything. See, I'm a holy woman. I know what it's like to give life to a being. without ever needing to press skin against one another. I've practiced how to hold my tongue long enough. I'm afraid I forgot to say goodbye. I'm afraid you're under the impression. That I was made to please you. I was under the impression you understood me better. The truth is, I'm a superwoman. And some days I'm an angry woman. And some days I'm a crazy woman. For still waiting, for still loving harder even if I'm aching. For still trusting that I'm still worth the most. For still searching for someone to understand me better"

And I've seen things and I've felt more pain. Than some will in their entire lives, all before. The age of even being able. to buy a fucking drink at a bar. But I have to be strong, not for myself. but for a greater purpose. because I feel like my duty is far beyond me, you know?. Beyond saving my family. It's for the world because somebody. Out there really needs to hear this so to anybody who. Isn't here to see how far I've gone. or how far I've yet to go. To family members that didn't make it. or friends I lost along the way. Or maybe someone I gave my heart to that. didn't know what to do with it. You should be here"

not used to it,"Typical story of an Oakland girl. Typical story heard around the world. Mama on her way, daddy up above. After 14 I guess I'm mini tough. Used to roll up on the block on the east side. I crack enough 40's by the sea side. Lose a nigga every week to a drive by. Whole bookshelf of stories behind these eyes. [Pre-Chorus].

Never read about these niggas. unless it's you that I'm choosin'. Even if I chose I feel like you're the right decision. Yeah you got aspirations, you ain't fuckin' up the vision. I love that you're not worried 'bout any other niggas. I'm longing for persistence, only want something consistent. Does it make you nervous I'm not afraid to say what I want?. Does it put fear in your heart that I know where I started. Far from where I begun?. Cause I know every man has a fear. of a strong-minded woman.

the letter,"I can hear your laugh. It's ringing through the hallways. I can see your smile. It's what gets me through my hard days. And your words was suppose to get me. Through my heartache, before my heartbreak. There's an emptiness that only few ever fill. And I somehow missed the meaning of love that is real. And it compliments my scars that will never heal. Maybe I didn't deserve you. Maybe I just couldn't cure you. They told me that I didn't hurt you. Why do I feel like I turned you?. Maybe I don't understand it. Tell me is this how you planned it?. Did you see us so stranded. Maybe I'm to much too manage. And if you weren't gonna guide me. Why bring me into the light?. Must have done something to make. You want to run and hide. Why oh why didn't you just live your life?. And every girl needs a mother. And damn it I needed you. Instead you duck for cover. And you ran from the truth. And like kids do. You waited around for proof. Maybe I didn't deserve you"

Go to the mall, spend a lump sum. They could try to catch up to us. But they're too busy making assumptions. Boy, you know all I do. Is stay up all night losing sleep over you. All I do. Is drive myself crazy thinkin' 'bout my baby. It's the way you walk, the way you talk, babe. It's the way you love, the way you fuck, the way. It's the way you are, you're a star, babe. It's the way you, it's the way you. She said ""I ain't even make my bed up. Watch your step, you gon' wake my mama and dad up"". Pssh, girl, didn't I tell you at the damn club?. We gon' wake your neighbors. Turn your block club to my fan club. And that happen so fast. Damn, I'm glad I strapped up. Ask her when she finish, if she came. She said ""I lapped ya twice"".

Left to dry with dry sheets and no deposit. They don't gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth. Put my hands in your mouth, girl. We got plans at my house, you know the way up. (Chorus). This thing we got is crazy. Only thing I know is you're my baby. Forever down, I am your lady. Always for sure, never a maybe. Never met someone who spoke my language. Never met a nigga done with playin'. You the type of nigga make me lane switch. Hand me the brush and say ""paint it"". Give me your heart and I hold it. Show me your soul and I'll mould it.

He found me in the perfect moment. But my lover made them heights. So much dome to clear my skies. I don't think I can deny. He makes me feel wanted. Like no one has before. He don't want nothing from me. But to know my love's for sure. Hate to be you watching him love me. I'd hate to be you watching him touch me. Now I am blessed to have what I need. Nothing compares, he is all I see. When I loved you I didn't love me. You were this dark cloud hanging above me. Got all my girls like, ""lani where'd you go?. You've begun to slip away into where, nobody knows"". I'm doing better. I brushed myself off, changed the weather. Like the sun you are so warm, and for once I feel adored. Oh I could not ask for more"
yet,"Look I ain't did shit to you yet. I ain't even shit on you yet. You ain't my enemy yet. But you ain't a friend to me yet. Don't recognize you. You ain't a friend to me yet. Don't recognize you. You ain't a friend to me yet. Now I see the fear and the threats. I see that it's hard to connect. I see niggas calling the rain but. The first to complain when they sneakers get wet. I see that I'm on some new shit. I see that it's something you hate. But what is not growing is dead. If you can't understand get the fuck out my face. You want something from me that I'm just not offering. You wanna roll but you just not down for?. You got potential, you got that, got that. You gotta ride the wave, stop acting like that. I can go on about days, days when I did it alone. Had to go from couch to couch. Now I am sippin' on thrones. Time when my pockets was?. Times when I just didn't eat. Times when my stomach was growling. My best friend and I went to sing on the street. I made a few dollars that day. I made 40 dollars the next. Now I hit the banks and I send all my aunties?. A deposit a check. Now I'm hitting it on the road. They talking about I'm 'bout to blow. I use to get paid to hang up all the posters. But now I'm packin' the show"
you should be here,"I'm looking right at you, but you're not there. I'm seeing right pass you, but you seem well aware. Your body is here but your mind is somewhere else. So far gone and you think I can't tell. Can't tell that you are disconnected. You pulled away and I miss your presence. I always said to you. Baby you should be here, right here. Baby you should be here, right here. Don't know where you went but you're lost now. Don't know where you went but you're gone now. Don't know where you went but you're lost now. Don't know where you went but you're gone now. Head on your chest babe, but your heart is so quiet. We use to talk all night long, now we laying in silence. Your arms around me but your soul is somewhere else. Gone so long and I know you so well. I know that you are everything that I ever dreamed of. And hoped that love had a happy ending. You should be here, right here yeah"
