don't bring me down,"I know, I know, I know. And I know, I know, I know. Love is a class A drug. They're selling it on corners, supplying demand. Is a remedial disorder it tries for your heart.

earl grey,"So now it's Earl Grey. Now it's Early Grey and sugar. I want Earl Grey, sugar and milk. Tea, yes tea. It's a... simple pleasure. It's a very simple pleasure. But it's a pleasure I need. (Check yeah, yo). It was the first of many challenges. To try convince the masses that we're talented. In a world full of watermarked canvases. And radio's that don't play songs if there's a rap in it. And fame's instantaneously given. If your face is positioned where the mass of population is driven. People believe what the papers have written cause. Rarely does truth even many any difference (yeah). We watch edited versions of other's lives. To deal with the issues that we have another time. Everything's an unpopularity contest. If you're not voted out it's you that they want less. You can end your career in one tweet. And child counsellors don't get enough sleep. Professional footballers earn more in one week. Than one of them earns in ten years at least. They're swept of their feet. they don't wanna know now. If they're listening or watching they just wanna zone out. Know how. We don't even know how to find our own mouth. When spoon fed a dose of being docile. Yeah, so now it's... Earl Grey. Now it's Early Grey and sugar. Now it's Earl Grey, sugar and milk. Tea, it's just tea. It's a... simple pleasure. It's a very simple pleasure. But it's a simple pleasure I need. (Check it). Hoods up is a necessity. Cause when my hood's down you still think less of me. Yeah it's one vicious circle. I'd rather keep my hood up to hide from all this negative energy. It's no wonder our society is segregated. When old people act surprised that I am educated. Disgression should be thought more. Rules mean nothing people love it when you break'em. Cause people clap when you're bad. People clap when you're good. People cheer when they're told. People laugh when they should. People dream of a little more sleep. But go full throttle at the end of the week. So gimme that club beat with the same old topic. I need to sing along while I drive to the office. Tell me to dance or 'bout the money that you make. So I can go to my desk and dream my life was the same. But being in the spotlight's a dark place. Cause normality's a drug that you can't take. People drive hard for a shot at the fast lane. It's only people from school that you can class mates. Yeah, so now it's Earl Grey. Now it's Early Grey and sugar. Now it's Earl Grey, sugar and milk. Yeah, just tea... tea. (Check it). It's a... simple pleasure. It's a very, very... simple pleasure. But it's a simple pleasure I need. (Check it). She's not smart but she's got a good heart. It's not about the winner. it's who took part (yeah). Tell the person who came last then they said they should laugh, Haha. (Haha, sorry, I got some more, leave it running, leave it running.). (It's not about who took part). Hold up... Put down down. You've got love by the bucket load. Don't turn that noun upside down. Don't frown (Check it). This train's like going out inside. I just managed to get in with my side out. It's really taking me somewhere. Except standing means you don't fit in. ADHD drugs are like the latest hd plugs. The ideas great but once you review the finer details you realize it's depressing. Having too much of something isn't pleasant. If I was born rich I'd kinda wish I was a peasant. Cause you learn a lot of lessons. If I was Jay Z and Beyonce. I'd send Blue Ivy into the ghetto 'till she was like 11. And then be like surprise you're a millionaire. Yeah... That is... That is not a rhyme, that's just talking. Yo, now listen. All I'm saying is yo. Now it's Earl Grey. Now it's Early Grey and sugar. So now it's Earl Grey, sugar and milk. It's just tea... It's only tea. It's a very simple pleasure. A very, very, very simple pleasure. But it's a very simple pleasure I need. And that's me. (simple pleasure I need). (I need this in my life,). (I need it ohh-woah-woah-ohh). (Keep it normal)"

i love you more than you think (feat. jamie cullum),"My brain's got a switch-off mechanism. I can switch off from any given. Opportunity to tell you what I really feel like.

That was weird, and it was years ago. Let's move on from that. I've realized sometimes I'm terrible. I've done things out of fear of the inevitable. There's been times when I've talked from my genitals. Or we've warred intellectually. Tried to pull the other off their pedestal. And yeah, I do win arguments so face it. And you hate that I love it, but you hate it. Then I forget to remind you of your greatness. And I never want you feeling unappreciated. I, I, I, I, I. I love you more than you think. I, I, I love you. I, I, I love you. I know there's been times when you've questioned my interest. Things have been said in jest. Accept I was never gonna treat you like a princess. Things got too intense. I didn't always wanna be there when you beckoned, I. Struggled with feelings inside. But believe that I'd be there in a second. If I was ever need by your side, alright. I think that we know that we know each other really well. I know I wanna know you for the rest of my life. Because no matter the length of time that's gone by. When I see you, it's fine. It's like I just saw you last night. And there's times when I've acted stupid. I suppose I'm just learning, it's different. But nothing is useless. I know that I love you without any terms or conditions. I, I, I, I, I. I love you more than you think. I, I, I love you. I, I, I love you. All I want is for you to be there.

So many people say why are you with her,. And I'm like; she's a damn good kisser,. She feeds my addiction,. She leaks something different,. The smoke from our last meeting has risen,. Keep her away from all of the other boys,. Cause you know she's every single cutters choice,. Always there when the cold nights are lurking,. Gotta keep hold of my golden virgin,. Chorus:. I think she's good for me,. That's why I don't want her to leave,. She helps me get down even when I shouldn't be,. She's there when I'm in need,. But she isn't cheap,. The last time I saw her,. Mostly I couldn't breathe,. And they say she's bad for me,. But they say she's bad for me,. But I don't think she's bad for me,. But it's a bit of a miss illusion,. She's got a mate called benson,. But he's a bitter of a waster,. Always chats about silver and gold,. But I don't think that he's safe (right?). Plus his mate like's to come out at break time,. Try's to act bad but I've smoked him like 8 times!,. And if I take it the wrong places then I face a fine,. And if I don't take it much she say's it's a waste of time,. In fact she doesn't lie,. She tells me that she's bad for me,. Even when I patch things up I don't feel like I have to leave,. I said I had to leave; I had to get away,. It's funny when I'm not around I've seen better days,. Sometimes I demonstrate how to set it straight,. I filter out the bullshit and keep her locked in case,. But when I'm chilling she's always in my mind,. I do her out but the doubts are just glassed in side,. I should respond in time but then I found out,. The last boy she kissed coughed and died,. Chorus:. I think she's good for me,. That's why I don't want her to leave,. She helps me get down even when I shouldn't be,. She's there when I'm in need,. But she isn't cheap,. The last time I saw her,. Mostly I couldn't breathe,. And they say she's bad for me,. But they say she's bad for me,. But I don't think she's bad for me,. But it's a bit of a miss illusion,. M-I-s-s-c-I-g-a-r-e-t-t-e leave me be,. M-I-s-s-c-I-g-a-r-e-t-t-e leave me be,. Can you please leave my vicinity,. Can you please leave my vicinity,. Actually wait nah I'll have another kiss,. Oh *** I'm in love with this chick what this its,. Straight robbery,. She's always there when I'm by myself and I can't remain solitary,. Babe honestly,. It appears that your bad for my health and a quick way to poverty,. You went from my pal to my lover,. Now I see you outside with thousands of other,. But you're on my mind right now,. So I guess I'm coming down from another little fling,. Gotta confess this,. Chorus:. I think she's good for me,. That's why I don't want her to leave,. She helps me get down even when I shouldn't be,. She's there when I'm in need,. But she isn't cheap,. The last time I saw her,. Mostly I couldn't breathe,. And they say she's bad for me,. But they say she's bad for me,. But I don't think she's bad for me,. But it's a bit of a miss illusion. [by: ludias]"
prophet (better watch it),"I'm lurking in your pocket, better watch it, rizzle kicks, ha!"". What! I'm last on the heaven list,. Cuss I couldn't give a ras what angelic is.. Even my laughter is venomous. Dennis is, not even half what this menace is.. We don't choose to make trouble. Holding up stores with lucazade bottles. I'm the one forcing you to break bad. Whilst little goodie two shoes glue plane models.. Mmmm an air of sophistication. When I enter various situations. Your best mate's gone downstairs. While your stuck there with his sister. Waiting.. I'm chilling in estates,. Sniffing at a rave. Sitting in a cave. With a grin up on my face. I aint civil but I'm brave. Never listening to faith. Quick smile. Then a middle finger to your face. Chorus. Stuck in your pocket in your feathers while you sleep. I am a prophet and a profit's what you'll keep. You and I belong together. I'll live within your soul forever. Verse 2. Ahahah, what, listen up yo, ah. I'm in the spare bedroom at parties. Full of sweet whispers not very smarties.. Hope that nobody comes in. Knock another drink, one thinks with no mention of car keys. I'm a hoodlum stood in the woodlands. Gonna set fire to the trees. Who wouldn't?. Du dum dum dum. End of the episode. Punk style death threat letter in the envelope.. Somebody's door for a quick whizz. Real weekender bloke somebody kiss this. I'm your mistress' mistress. That your wife didn't put on her christmas wish list.. Let me rifle a quick flow. More punchlines than a highschool disco. Ain't nobody gonna tell me what I wanna do. I'm rude. Get your thongs out I'm called sisqo. Chorus. Stuck in your pocket in your feathers while you sleep. I am a prophet and a profit's what you'll keep. You and I belong together. I'll live within your soul forever. Verse 3. The one who wakes up and can feel no pain. Cus you strive on another mans strain. Me and you will never be the same. Cuss clearly for you this aint just a phase. The type to steal something although that it is free. The type to make a promise just to break it clean. Who are you trying to be. Who are you trying to please. Make your mind up and choose your way. Maybe then we can seal the daaay. Chorus x2. Stuck in your pocket in your feathers while you sleep. I am a prophet and a profit's what you'll keep. You and I belong together. I'll live within your soul forever. Stuck in your pocket in your feathers while you sleep. I am a prophet and a profit's what you'll keep. You and I belong together. I'll live within your soul forever. [by: ludias]"

this means war (feat. dabbla),"Estate war. What you got an aggy face for?. We carry eggs it's not just life that we claim's raw. Taking advantage of the days without rainpour. We remain poor, so wait pause incase your face falls foul to the product of fowl. We like to cage more. Don't be a chicken. See me I'm feasably different. To the kids on my estate who like to beef and not listen. I had a sweet disposition. But I was still weak to convincing. Ask your mum for 50p then mischievously buy eggs.

traveller's chant,"Last week, I was passenger on a car seat. Thinking of decisions that I made within a heartbeat. She used to make my heart beat but usually alarms me. My lungs are over. Working and I [can't breathe]. Yes I convinced myself I don't like relationship malarkey,. But she said ""wait, you didn't ask me. [How I felt]"". I said ""I love that you're a [nice girl]. And I'm sorry but this really wasn't timed well"". It kinda feels like it was mainly a blur. Maybe coffee and telly is what I mainly prefer. Feel I gotta scratch the surface. Gotta break it to learn,. And now I multiply the times in which the tables have turned. I call this the Traveller's Chant. Whether you're sitting on a train or in the back of a car. Thinking, maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be. (Got places to be). And do I start at the end or do I end at the start?. In this little bit of time will I get very far?. Maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be. And I'll be there. Yes... Yeah the other day I was sitting on the train. But in another place. I was on my way home, but maybe some would say. I was thinking 'bout the days I wanna run away. I've only really got a couple mates - me, myself and I, how cliché. Looking out the window, feels like I'm in a film. Director, producer and as it happens I'm the main [character]. Yeah, my own little feature length. Soundtrack being whatever's in my speakers [then]. I'd rather not be held accountable,. I bank on people's feelings. It's no wonder why I'm feeling spent. Yeah, and in a deeper sense. Sometimes I need the rain it helps me kinda clean my head. The sun's an easy friend. I'm thinking maybe the duration of my journey's. Helped me reconnect my feelings then. I call this the Traveller's Chant. Whether you're sitting on a train or in the back of a car,. Thinking, maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be. (Have places to be). And do I start at the end or do I end at the start?. In this little bit of time will I get very far?. Maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be. And I'll be there. [oooaah oooah woaaah]. [oooaah oooah woaaah]. [oooaah oooah woaaah]. I've got places to be. And I'll be there. [oooaah oooah woaaah]. [oooaah oooah woaaah]. And I'll be there. I said I'll be there. And I'll be there. I call this the Traveller's Chant. Whether you're sitting on a train or in the back of a car,. Thinking, maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be. (Got places to be). And do I start at the end or do I end at the start?. In this little bit of time will I get very far?. Maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be. And I'll be there. I call this the Traveller's Chant. Whether you're sitting on a train or in the back of a car,.

trouble,"[x2:]. I'm in trouble ups I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble ups I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. Listen yeah. I was at this club one time with a couple of mates. We were moving to the music. we were busting some shakes. I said i wanted a fag. But they were loving the bass. So i headed to the smoking bit to puff in and wait. And then this kiddy, obviously had summin to say. started moving to me, tried to get all up in my face. and the his friends intervened. like yeah you called him a mug. I didn't have a clue but then they started punching. away i thought well. [Hook:]. A wiseman said to me the recipe for life. Is to conserve your energy unless you feel it's right. Oh oh don't dance with the devil unless he's in your. mind. Take hold of the rebel. And take this fight outside. I thought damn, this puts me in a difficult position. three against one, but then my mates came in my vision. fully backing it became the obvious decision. And its funny how these idiots were acting kind of. different like nah. Brother you were giving it the biggun. All of a sudden somebody calls chief Wigan. And now to the custody center I'm being driven. Don't you have to do a crime to be here, when I didn't?. Police are so bad it's kinda gotten old. Like respect was an order they really wasn't told. and when the blues act jazzy you wanna slap em to the. floor like. yeah bitch that's what I call a rock and roll. [Hook]. Maybe I do maybe I don't. Maybe I do maybe I don't. I'm in trouble woops I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble Everything was going well and now. I'm in trouble woops I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble could somebody explain just how?. I'm in trouble woops I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble I just lost my head and i found. I'm in trouble woops I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble pow. [Hook]. [x2:]. I'm in trouble woops I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble woops I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble again. [By : ludias]"

Yeah, and now that I'm older, I wish I could of been everything that I wanted (I'm on it). I think that if I think back (back). To the days when I thought I didn't think that nothing that I thought would not be possible. Tryna' figure that out (out). But I didn't know how. To settle for a desk drop bringing those pounds. I wanted to live in those clouds. These days I deliver no sounds. I always thought of myself as a simple dreamer. I never tried too hard but believed it. Now all of a sudden it's gone my way. Back when I was younger, I wanted to be everything on the planet (on the, on the, on the planet). Now that I am older, it seems the ambition has vanished.

wind up (feat. herman stephens),"Yo. Move to the rhythm of smoke. Fire me up with the influence. As the DJ scratches the Vinyl. Poor some wine to the instruments. Yo, there was this girl that i loved right. She had me thinking of her face when I brush my teeth. It was all too close to home. She lived down my road. But she was up my street. So I, I thought I'd remind her of my. (Ay-yeah-eah-ah-ey). But her response might be the. (Sa-ah-ah-ah-me). I don't wanna wait another. (Day-ay-ay-ah-ay). Oh, she's walking on the line. So we started talking. I know you came to this place. To unwind. So how can I wind up with you?. Wind up. Wind up. So how can I wind up with you?. Wind up. Wind up. Wi-wi-wind up. So how can I wind up with you?. Yo, yo. She's a wind-up merchant. I'm a very nice person. I can be sunshine in your life. So I've gotta make certain. You don't make curtains. These girls are so self-destructive. Stupid guys they're ending up with. She's the man of his dreams, oh yeah?. Well, he's as deep as cinema ice cream. And I'd reminded her of my. (Ay-yeah-eah-ah-ay). She started to focus in on my. (Fa-ay-ay-ah-ace). Whoah, yeah, this is the chance that I should. (Ta-ay-ay-ay-ake). Go, you're talking to her now. Yeah, so I thought I'd ask. I know you came to this place. To unwind. So how can I wind up with you?. Wind up. Wind up. So how can I wind up with you?. Wind up. Wind up. Wi-wi-wind up. So how can I wind up with you?. What I'm trying to say. Does not make sense in your brain. I'm finding it hard to explain. So I'm just gonna repeat myself. Again. I know you came to this place. To unwind. So how can I wind up with you?. Wind up. Wind up. So how can I wind up with you?. Wind up. Wind up. Wi-wi-wind up. So how can I wind up with you?"
