Wrecking they brains, tryna' figure where I'm getting that cheddar. I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone. I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown.

loyalty (skit),"You know while your mother is cooking the macaronni. Today I figured i'd sit down and talk to you since your old enough.. You know its time that you really realize what this family is all about. Cause about this time is when your gonna be able to join in. And earn some real money and real cash. But before you do that I wanna teach you a little bit about loyalty,. The main name of this game is respect and loyalty.. Family is a big thing when we do this kind of business. Everything is with respect and when a family member. Gets outta Line and another family don't like it one thing leads to another. And the next thing you know, your gone. And then your just a memory of me,. My hearts broke then, but you gotta remember. Theres always family and loyalty,. Loyalty is the main thing.. Obviously you know i don't make my money,. I don't make all my cash from uh construction jobs we do and. Uh sanitation and private stuff is all earned money through the family. And since your of age now i think its time. . I taught you what coming into the family and respect is all about.. So the first thing you gotta learn is the name respect,. Tha means you don't cross nobody you don't go over the line,. Once you go over that line theres no coming back. Whether youre a member of the family or not.. Thats when people get whacked. And we don't want nobody whacked in our family. So i gotta teach you the proper way of respect.. When youre earning money, everybody earns, everybody eats bread.. Its all about cash money thats what its all about making the money.. So the first thing of business is this, you remember your name,. You don't forgets your roots.. You never ever ever disrespect anyone thats above you. Especially your capo. Especially the big time guys, those are the guys you listen to.. You never ever disrespect anyone. Unless your told to unless you get the okay.. And if there is no sit down theres nothing."
