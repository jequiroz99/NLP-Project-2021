brother,Now here is a quick story that I'd like to tell. Check the clock it was good timing. In the rearview things seem closer then they appear. Car pulled over at around 4oclock. Jumped out rang the door bell. Sweat dripped down the back like the sun was shinning. Knew that I was in a good position. Door opened and standing in front of me. Could it be yes it was Heaven how you been. Haven't seen you in a minute friend. And I've been dreaming of the day we would reconnect. They said you died and your soul left your body. Well as far as I'm concerned you are still with me. And those I know that never got to meet you. In the physical human form they can see you. Twenty five years old spirit like a lion. Running wild well then again that was me. That which I saw in you. And although you're not in your body. You are still with me. Your soul my brother soul. Did all I knew how to. And turning the clock back. Not sure would change anything. From Florida to California Kept in touch with you. But I had my own issues So I wished you the best. You said not to keep my eggs All in the same basket. Well now I ask this Can a brother be a branch to a tree. That's holding space for all humanity. Humbling the heart with A childhood memory. Walking across the back yard. Sitting in the swing with my eyes closed. Eyes open colorful light bursting. Jumping off landing Two feet upon the ground. A tent for us to camp in. Stare directly in your eyes Daze off in the horizon. As if we where the same entity. Equal exchange simple and plain. Hand shake time leave Maybe see you again. Up the stairs through the backdoor. Out the front sat back in the vehicle. Drove off what a rush. And although you're not in your body. You are still with me. Your soul my brother soul. Did all I knew how to. And turning the clock back. Not sure would change anything. Waking up from a dream like that. So vivid Foggy bits mixed with crystal clear pieces. Saw my brother but I wondered Who he was. Sitting up in my bed now wide wake. Call it creation the ever changing. Sunset lights on but it seemed vacant. Well that's amazing when freedom is escaping. And dream time becomes waking life. Now make a toast to the most highly incredible. Feeling of knowing that love is something beyond. A written down painted picture on a wall. Classic never been done. The effortless sweet words under your tongue. A vision so pure the measurement. Who poured the medicine. Kept me on a course. And always on that regimen. A radical outcast on an escapade. In this dreamscape we keep each other safe. And although you're not in your body. You are still with me. Your soul my brother soul. Did all I knew how to. And turning the clock back. Not sure would change anything
"classic (feat. chantal kreviazuk, chachillie)",Over 20 plus. Of rhyming so miraculous. Meticulous years I've spent digging up the dust. New boots shoes I've got those. Clean souls shell toe. Protected it's the way I go. Growth is. A stage of development. I saw the first stair. And started climbing it. Right left left right. I'm off the wall. I said once and again. Now you hear my call. And even if it was something. That I may have thought that. I did wrong. In the ground dug my feet in deep. My feet and toes and my hands. They all graze in place. Where they all eat upon. There's not much left to chose. Leave it out until it's gone. I'm gonna ride with them as if they where family. Since we are any way. Can you hear me. I know you have a lot in side of your. Busy day. And I wish that I could be the one. That will provide you with your. Wholesome outcome
dream come true,You see how life has lessons. If we don't learn where missing. Out on what is truly giving. Some people call it destiny. When it's such a distance. Ahh I can barely reach it. Close but then it's gone. So we keep on climbing. Reaching the highest climax. Praying that it won't go. It's lonely only after. You finish the final chapter. And you cant really read. You see all the words they get. Oh so blurry. But please don't worry. I'm right there waiting. If your love has a language. I want to learn it. Every single verb an adjective. I want to earn it. To be a pro now. Means I'm one with your voice. As if I was the candle that you blew out. I see the smoke signal. It's no longer single. Smell the sage mixed with mahogany. I love my wife my life. Call it monogamy. Nuclear family. Now that's a recipe. I'm right there waiting outro
ego,That's what the keys for. To open up the lock. Colorful combination. What makes your clock tick. Not neurotic I see my ego. Edging God out. The man in the overcoat. Always looking down. Waist high the tropical snow fall. Feet across the ice. Let the flower pack your pipe. The mystery teacher. The history they speak of is not love. For us its not love. Chorus. My ego getting bigger. Getting louder And. It's getting me in trouble. I take something so humble. My bravado co-opt's it on the double. My big head in the door way. There is no way. That it's big enough for me. With ego edging God out. All this fall out. With these self shouts-out for me. Pull me up Pull me up I'm falling in. Can't swim wait then again I can. Always can fresh across the border. Master piece theater. With the Olympic torch holder. Believe or not. My friends know who I am. And I planned that. Knowing that we will over stand. And I give back. Through art call it prophecy. What ever you need we've got it. Part of the puzzle piece. Genius. Gentle with it now and easy does it. So you don't loose your bit of faith. While you discover. Who you are and truthfully who you want to be. With out my dark light shadow. There'd be no me. Repeat Chorus. Eye of the tiger eye of the young man. Listening to acapellas. People watching. We have the choice. Whether or not to live in the grid. I am Iron horse running. Toward the forest as a kid. Hold the fort down and the stereo. Turn the speakers up It's a miracle. Lets recognize each other in our own. I find the highest good in growing up. Honor my birthright. Picking the red or the blue pill. Where will we go I know the story. The same one that you where told. You're hungry enough with ambition Animal. I'm not going to go that way. I know the road. Repeat Chorus
follow your heart,Danger angers not danger. I'm no stranger with the Extreme. Exaggerated there's nothing left. Wait there's a whole bunch. Think of the sand in exotic lands. Full moon check the moon shine. Off of the ocean floor. In love with Canada truly the trinity. No amateur arms extended. Send them out no vengeance. I'm a comic a book. Beam me up it's hypnotic. Double Handed man the canvas. It's all night like Midas six am the tides out. Eight mile jog before the caffeine hits. Wake up celebration of life. Never retreat eggs crack Halloween. Now that's a knee slapper the irresistible. Make it simple when things seem difficult. Remove some syllables watch your fingers. Run across the water like a miracle. Hook. Follow your heart. And keep your head up. As the wind forms the clouds. New paintings take shape. May the rough get smooth. And the smooth get rough. Everything will be ok as the sail boat sails away. And the dreams of our children manifest fully. Let your body stretch out activate. Toward acceptance interdependence. I pledge allegiance to giving and receiving. Who's the lucky winner on the price of desire. Earth wind and fire my thumb presses tightly. Up against my index and my middle. While my pinky and my ring finger close in. That's the mudra that I use. When I'm in self discovery mode ancient. Is the way that I flow mysteriously. As I travel through time space continuum. Convincing evidence is not needed. For me to life my life beyond survival. Arriving at the home of thriving. Welcome to the King and the Queen dome
fountain of youth (feat. wade morissette),Beautiful is the planet divine creator. I am in love with you're nature. Symmetrical True light shines unconditional. Archangel spiritual raise a child and watch them grow. Purity it's up to me to be the man I want to be. Fill my life with good company. Got a shoulder to lean on feel the pressure. Take a deep breath out No depression. Finally resting Silence is a blessing. Can I have a little time alone. Please don't take it personally. I've got to free my heart and soul. Number one goal that's self-control. Mastery that's what the new man be. Turn the me to we form community. Back in the day use to spin the bottle. Look at you now you're a role model. Father figure want to make a life that's. Better for my children learn how to Feel. Be in love what is real I know that I can heal. And eventually reveal emotions I conceal. My Motive is to clear negativity and fear. Till finally I appear. Note to self does my self really need a note. Can I offer you a hug. Brother will you ever know. Sister how I feel for you. Eternal Love experience. The ethereal as above so below. Emotionally I go deeper. Till I awaken. The inner dream weaver. The warrior that's inside. The seeker I know I'll find. Cause I'm a believer in the light
good company,Roll out the red carpet Sparking another one. Spoken like a get that stick out of your spoke. Yes I'll be the spokesman Turn that soil over. Get a compost Never to old true. To have a mentor look up. The bright light turned the night to day. Write it down if you have something to say I will. To become I've Focused on my signs. It's low key Saturday night. Wont ever stop Thin line that you're walking on. Sharpen your edges Stay in the grove. I see you l. o. v. e's not an I owe you. And how can we claim that it is. When the elephant sitting in the room is so big. Chorus. I'm in good company. High in my family tree. Loyalty abounding. Hottest bird beside me. Yes a tip of the hat baby blue kangol fitted. Heard the end is near that's cool and tight. The way that it was knitted. Fabric of life abracadabrical mic. Spotted a few kangaroos. While koalas followed up upon us. No inhibitions bears no longer hibernating. Removed the basic instinct Leave them bare naked. My brother told me he was up for the fight. I threw the battery at him. He literally did return to Saturn. I received a message from him. He said Yes prioritize Clear to see that you can be. Creating family rarely these days. Are we open to follow grace. Imagine a place every step. Was intended in a natural way. Not too far save the Panda We gotcha. Knowing that we are part of the Answer. The question is limitless No interference. Look at how beautiful it is When there's a clearing. Repeat Chorus. I see the picture How pressure made you sicker. And I always had the inkling Too scared to be the weak link. Our golden fence was meant To be the strongest. Brotherly bond beyond what they can harvest. Mom said there'll be days like this so while I reminisce. I think of how it went down I'd put my feet in your shoes. But they'd never fit And I was always confused. You where the confident one. Faster then most passing go with out taking a break. We all have angels that sit upon our shoulders. In the dark corners you can hear them whispering. Providing light when you really can't see a thing. Maps laid out perhaps a snap of my finger. Will bring your life back. And we'll have a final laugh together. Best friends follow truth cause it last forever. Repeat Chorus
guru,I started young. I was enthralled. By your agape. As a student. I kept going. Colour me captured. Disillusioned enough. Needed your guidance. And so I turned. Over to you. To lead me home. And then I said. Guru teacher. Guruji I bow to you. Humbled by your knowledgeable education. Guruji I bow to the divine in you. Please consider me your utmost humble student. And so I fell. Under your spell. I was enraptured. Your every word. I held onto. ‘Til it was gospel. You weren't deterred. From your asserts. We're identical. I will admit. I saw your face. Inside my face. Guru teacher. Guruji I bow to you. Humbled by your knowledgeable education. Guruji I bow to the divine in you. Please consider me your utmost humble student. Guru teacher. Guruji I bow to you. Humbled by your knowledgeable education. Guruji I bow to the divine in you. Please consider me your utmost humble student”. Guru teacher. Guruji I bow to you. Taken by your knowledgeable education. Guruji I bow to the divine in you. Thanks for pointing back to my inherent wisdom
hip hop medicine (feat. dustin tavella),I had a dream with my perfect picture in it. Never thought that tinted widows. Would become a necessity. I realized as a young guy. How it all ties together in an intricate weave. Now I dot my eyes and cross my T's. Self educated out of a town of boredom I made it. Made it meaning I got a hold on something other. Then what I thought I could have had. Or would've wanted to go explain. And a coulda woulda shoulda attitude is not my aim. While the world seems out of order. I investigate my own inadequacies. Till I believe their no longer part of me. And once I do I'm on to the nexus. Of this it's the connection that I'm looking for. Keeping the mind open sober or smoking. He quit quitting he's taking a long break. He's gone a long way far from where he use to be. It takes a lot of strength faith and ingenuity. To learn to slow down the mind when its racing. Consumed with what chasing forget the destination. I'm delivering cut out the middle man. Raw independent hip hop. That's what where giving them. Hook. Don't you stop it don't you stop it. Hip-hop Hip-hop Hip-hop. Souleye got your medicine. Don't you stop it don't you stop it. Hip Hop. Souleye Bringing the medicine. Bringing the medicine. Bringing the medicine. Verse. Visualize use your inner eye. Some call it the third chakra provocative words. I'm not gonna slur all done with the mumbling fun. A little moment to breath the mark of the beast. Removed as easy as 1-2-3. For some though its not as simple as a drum roll. It's ineffable like mother Mary holding on. To the holiest hands of the golden child. With a double rainbow above or beyond. The psychedelic can't even utter or wonder. What it's like to be like Mike or Christ right. I'm out of my mind when I write. Its nice it livens it up. My frames are vintage old age Indian English. I wonder what's the day any way. Do you know what it would be like. To be in the presence of another dimensional being. Let me know it's the reason I'm Emceeing. Hook. Don't you stop it don't you stop it. Hip-hop Hip-hop Hip-hop. Souleye got your medicine. Don't you stop it don't you stop it. Hip Hop. Souleye Bringing the medicine. Bringing the medicine. Bringing the medicine
human overwhelm,Verse 1. I'm the type of guy to burn a candle when I write. I like the inspiration from the flame it ignites. A part of my spirit It reminds me that God is inside. Everything that I see Now that's my belief. I know there are those that may think differently. And as the rain showers fall on the spring time flowers. There's a lot going on in the garden these day's. Harvest times coming soon Got an abundant bloom. Anything is possible Remember when I was a little man. And started with ambitions to go ahead and make it happen. The captain of my ship that's what I've got to be. When the winds are blowing heavy and I think that I am sinking. I remember all my blessing gratitude fills my cup. The attitude that I take on the day to day. is what's going to go and pave my way. Self Love You gotta love your self. To receive love or even receive help. Verse 2. Fast Forward still want to find a rhyme with orange. Its never boring exploring new territory. That was once foreign Orbiting around my head. Are always lyrics a range of different ways I can arrange them. So appealing you see to me to be the alchemist I am. I turn a lemon to lemonade the currency for me from you. That's appreciation I am valuable gratitude I line it up with my attitude A couple tattoos remind that I've got the power to choose. I've got an arrangement of tools. That help me to feel good if I'm at a loss. And if my vibes low I connect with my soul. I feel it coming yes I am aware. And everyday is different so I always prepare. Never knowing where a typical day will take me. And when I'm feeling human overwhelm I breathe. Verse 3. As a kid on December 25th My mother would work. So I always missed Christmas. I told my friends Santa was late. And then a few days later Saint Nicolas was there. Though I knew it wasn't him and a kind of weird lie. Guess it was fun but then again. I kind of wish mom and dad told me. It was them buying me gifts It would have explained the over time. And late night shifts no complaining as an adult now. It formed me to be who I am. Thank you for that. And as father I celebrate 12-25 as the day my son was born. I felt my self it transformed. Beyond my wildest imagination. We are the key To the next generation. So as I live my life. I remember that it starts inside
if,"I'm preparing for what is appearing. To be a clear way Father taught me. That there's one truth. But many paths The joker had a good laugh. Sitting in the back of the class not aloud. Too loud for them to hear us. Just a dream please no drama. The make-believe. Family role that we played. Memory lane do you relate. Were all healing our pain. I'm feeling something coming on. Stronger then ever. Continually feeling to heal. Digging deep through grief. All watching as it moves forward. Into the direction of a well focused word. Thought out sentences. Or reply a response to this responsive. Hyper-Vigilant lost child of unconscious. Containment, no cross talk. Balanced life hoh-mee-uh-stey-sis. Chorus. If I I I I could give it give it. If I I I I could give it give it Keep Quiet. If I I I I could give it give it Keep writing. If I I I I could give it give it Keep showing up. If I I I I could give it give it Keep watching. We leave each other traces and trails. Ideas and letters some woven together. In and out of Dualities lasso placebo. Place that down on the ground. Until we go pray to the earth. I see she's a castle ways that I've. Learned increase help to match you. Tattoo on your back arm and shoulder. Beauty you knew it and see it. Eye of the beholder. Underneath the story there was more for us. To read One seed when planted. It formed your density. Enough to feed the entire galaxy. Forethought forward on toward. A moral fiber of meaning. Being the breath fresh. Branches above your head bend around. Your hand lifts as the leaf swirls. In circles keep calling them home. Allow the drums to be a guide to a place unknown. Bridge. The trial and error area A child discerning growing. Up to be part of the earth society. Call it the trial and error area A child discerning. Growing up to be part of the earths society. Chorus.

labeled,Verse 1. I believe in a world where war no longer exists. We negotiate instead of hate. Now that's what I'm talking about. The Natural state of human happiness. Before the neglect and the trauma hit. Judgment definition of my character. A rarity these days for me to meet some one. Who can look me in the eyes and have me feel like a loved one. I know there's cultural social and institutional. Family issues and provocative victims. Who set them selves up to loose. There's intent behind the action that's made. It's kind crazy when you think about. The things people say. Out of defense while there acting out. Younger then there kids throwing tantrums. Loose cannons carrying hand guns. Time bombs ticking ready to self-destruct. Your mind can be a land mine. Just don't give up. Hook. You don't even know my name yet. And you already got me labeled. You don't even know my name yet. And you don't see to want to learn. You don't even know my name yet. And you already got me labeled. You don't even know my name yet. And you don't see to want to learn. Verse 2. Rough times lack of sun shine and Vitamin D. An in adequate diet car is running on empty. Imbalance in my brains chemicals is nasty. And I know people who think they can fix it themselves. Next thing you know I'm living In heaven. But it feels like hell I pay attention to the small details. Why would I want to get angry at some one beeping there horn. I don't know what's going on behind closed doors. I tell my son that there in rush maybe they missed there lunch. It's not our business any way so let them pass. Lets get on with our day it's a bright clear sky. Today's not cloudyayy Yeah its smooth like that. When you look eye to eye And feel the souls contact. Contracts that I write I keep them all win win. That's the benefit of giving see there's love in the end. Verse 3. I Live life I don't let life live me. I where my clothes cause I wanna. Not cause there cool your life's an art piece a book bestseller. Realize its okay to make mistakes I don't dwell on. The voice in my head is not me. I change my perspectives and I take a different view. You'll be amazed when you open the cage. Let the animals free then show them where to eat. I heard the story about judgment and the book. Bad vs good right vs wrong life vs death. Light vs dark all of this seems incredibly separative. No wonder there's people feeling Alienated. Imagine a life I wonder when it will be. When your neighbors are your friends. And we are one community
magic life (feat. chachillie),"So many places in my life that I lived in. Traveled East and West looking to find. What was with In Taking a couple steps. Want to know the direction. If I don't search how will I know what I was given. I Feel like Santiago in the book the Alchemist. Or maybe King Arthur in The mist of Avalon. Its all these mysteries Joseph Cambell talked about. The Power of Myth Following your bliss. Come and feel the Rapture. It's time for the next chapter. Even when I feel like there is no way I can write it. Brought in to this world where people are divided. There's no secret I know the Artist Way. Still to this day disdain is engraved. Pack up your bags its time to go play. Wait no longer It's happening here. Tell me what are we waiting for something to appear. Hook. If you really want it you can have it. If you can see it happen it will happen. You can bring it to you like a magnet. Careful what you think about. Cause life is really Magic. Now this song's not about. Quick fingers. A sleight of hand. Rabbit out of the hat cleverness. No disrespect to Magicians. Or Illusionist With there palm. switch, ditch, steal, load, simulation. Misdirection sure Penn & Teller will never tell ya. So lets explore the theory of relativity. Even Einstein had a mind defined by the lines of time. So as I enter back through my birth of the Dmt. And I feast on scraps and I write these raps. And I fell that there's not many that really know what. I'm talking about. Maybe if I slow it down. And speak to you like this. you might get that feeling. I'm a physic I've got the fire burning. I've got that blue flame. I had some tea with Merlin and now I'm never the same. So Hocus pocus abracadabra alakazam. Language is an instrument that takes us. Beyond the horizon Go ahead and look in"
miles away,I was still sleeping. When I heard it. Woke up suddenly. Must have been the current. A lifelong melody. Me and my mind never stop talking. Why would I wanna. I love that part of me. We do it often. An on occasion. During certain conversations. It's like vacation. Music's every where I go. Every step I take Is another part of the flow. Good morning American born. I hear the horns in the background. As the cars pass. I've got my License for living. And I'm not gonna slow down. The speed limit was never given. No competition Rhythmic intercourse. And a pure deep vision. And of course there's always. More I guess I guess. I've got to look at all the signs and symbols. It's seriously simple Keep my ears open. And prepare for the sound. It's like an echo when you hear it. It comes back around. Listen. I can hear you coming. From a mile away. If you vibe the music. Then the music well play. Say goodnight. Good morning again. The syncopated. Cali fornicated. Look it mom we made. When the sun comes up. The birds sing harmony. That's the way the of track. If you the know music. Then go ahead. Music. Go ahead and turn it up now. Music. You can hear it's all around
on & on,"No matter how clear the vision or distorted. No matter if it's saved or never was recorded. All aboard the mother ship Impulse so important. A soldier takes notice to their orders or aborts them. Suppress your anger for awhile see what happens. Pain or passion rewire poverty to fullness. Once done consider it new fresh. Walk up the street with a bounce in my step. Focus like a hawk Feel the energy of eagles. I am an animal inside of this wonderful world. Took a cup shook it up. To stimulate the sediment. Never Settling for less then the best. To paint a picture of a blue sky family crest. Victimized cry wolf, hide and seek. As the sky is falling. Stars lasting longer then they have in the past. I fall asleep wake up teacher sleeping in class. And if the apple's gone rotten. There are more out in the orchard. Scarecrows following each through the courses.

And on and on I keep on growing. Standing Awaken born in the moment. And on and on I keep on going. Dreaming, thinking, believing, Knowing. And on and on I keep on Growing. Standing Awaken born in the moment. Who's that knock knocking on your door. Open up the window Calling up the kin folk. Climbing up the ladder I can hear the pitter patter. Playing in the puddle outside with the masses. A whole school of fish swimming With intelligence. Enough to keep the circle together. I'm skipping rocks across the water. Land marks mechanical My chemical make up. Be that of Jacobs ladder I'm not afraid to call it back. Swing batter rush the Heavily gates. Saw a picture in the sky before it was written. You talking Dna a Ufo conspiracy. I dig my fingers underneath the ground. Work to see what I can find And through this lens. I'm steady and ready to move along. What once was, always is But some times seems gone. Dialogue at the corner stone with the colony. Enough sun vitamin light provide clarity. I am a magnet to life yes the chain reaction. A tiger in the wilderness A full experience. Provide pressure to the accurate points. The infinite choice to choose that's what I enjoy. Repeat Chorus"
our flight,I'll never forget the feeling. I got when we first met. I lost my breath found it underneath your table. Put it back in my chest. it's hard to explain its more like. You where from the same meteorite. Or maybe once a upon a time we rode a llama. Through the open savanna. The natural mystic. Feeling that's the one I got. Like oh my God how could this be. I guess its all irrelevant we where riding elephants. On the sands of Dubai. That's some future fiction. The futures never fixed. I'll never really know. How to predict what's next so. I just go with the flow. And follow the patterns. Track moons and data. Believe in something bigger then me. That truly matters. I dive in to the ocean of life. And see a beautiful world. Enjoying Our Flight. Hook. I feel you inside my heart all day. I know its true I know its true. I feel you inside my heart all day. I know it's Real so real. Verse 2. Will you be my valentine. Lets tell time to take a break for a minute. You and I are stay committed. To the healing for each other. Support back to the source where we all unite. I'm in a tent out side base of Mt Shasta. With my kids talking to Ascended masters. Who where speaking faster then I could comprehend. I had to slow them down a bit. and tell them I wasn't. Caught up with the Pleidian's. Though I knew Amorah. Quan Yin. May she rest in peace. All is well all is well. That's what she use to sing. while I watched the Angels Soar. High above me while I was riding dinosaurs. Soaking in hot springs. till my sore back was sore no more. What a great feeling Straight to the core. I heard the knock on heavens door and I opened it. Our flight is taking off all aboard the infinite. If I was asked what Truth is. I would say it's a women or man with a purpose. No matter what that is from raising kids. To being a scientist. lets stay connected. And there are times when I'm feeling my life. Is not on the wrong path and things aren't right. I raise my vibes here's a list of a few. I know its kind of unsolicited advice to you. But if your listening I would think its ok. I exercise pet my dogs or I go for a walk. Come along lets take a ride today. On a space ship into the milky way. Do you ever think about what's out there. Light years away. I relax and then I let my worries go
pain body,"Verse. No matter how dark the clouds get. No hope and nothing left. And during day time all I think. About are the dreams that I had the night before. Missing the whole day struggling to sleep. And when I do I'm finally back in it. There they are I know you hear me. We are one good for you what about all of us. Everyone way before we where born. I'm talking prehistoric way before. The little engine that could. And did and wanted more. Before the ego belittled delivering. Better then worse then. Before there was a difference. Between you and any other. I'm talking way back. When there was only the moment. And categories, labels and bullying. Where not the in thing no punishing. Back before Kings even existed. What really mattered was supporting one another. Waking up on the wrong side of the bed. I tried to wake and bake to ease my head. Relive that tension and remove my stress. Yet to no avail I felt trapped in the wallowing. The walls where caving in on my day. I thought I'd hit the gym. And shake this mood. Maybe it's my blood sugar. And I need some food. I went to therapy at three. To see if that may work. I called my Bff. But he was out to lunch. I put on music read a book. But nothing seemed to help. I closed my eyes thought that I'd. Meditate for minute. See if that may elevate the Pain. That I'm feeling. Curious to find out. Why I feel like this. Maybe it's my vibration. And my consciousness. If I change my thoughts. Will it help fix this. Emotion that I think is a problem"

Instead we keep it copasetic. Self medicated to cope. Let the wild man in me run. We can rewind it like a rerun. I can't imagine life with out a son. You see sometimes when the sun. Comes out I want to climb up. Find joy in the moment. Not just the climax. Taught to keep running. Now learning how to relax. Safe and secure with my self. And those around me. That's my living proof. Hook: (lynx). Baby I'm running hard running through. This life is a wilderness just like you. After the winter's gone comes the bloom. Baby I've seen the sun pulling through.

Like a rubber band. When the lights go out. And darkness fills the room. And my minds racing. Things seem out of place. My goals are gone. And the future visions a blur. Decisions are hard to make. And mistakes never occur. Turn down the road. While I'm running. Jumping over hurdles. Seeking visions in the deepest. Darkest places I know. Not afraid of being lost. Where I go so if it wasn't for that. And all the things that we do. In hopes to be truthful. And fit in I'm running away from it. Don't want it need it or even get it. I hope you know that. Hook: (lynx). Baby I'm running hard running through. This life is a wilderness just like you. After the winter's gone comes the bloom. Baby I've seen the sun pulling through
