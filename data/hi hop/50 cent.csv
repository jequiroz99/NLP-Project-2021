Niggas heard I fuck with Dre,. now they wanna show me love. When you sell like Eminem,. and the hoes they wanna fuck. But homie ain't nothing change ho's down, G's up. I see Xzibit in the Cut. that nigga roll that weed up. If you watch how I move. you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp. Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp. In the hood, in L.A. they saying ""50 you hot"". They like me,. I want them to love me like they love 'Pac. But holla in New York. them niggas'll tell ya im loco. And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold. I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind. I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind. Now shawty said she feeling my style,. she feeling my flow. Her girlfriend wanna get bi. and they ready to go. [Chorus (2x)]. You can find me in the club,. bottle full of Bud. Look mami I got the X,. if you into takin' drugs. I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love. So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed. My flow, my show brought me the dough. That bought me all my fancy things. My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels. Look nigga I done came up and I ain't change.. And you should love it, way more then you hate it. Nigga you mad?. I thought that you'd be happy I made it. I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life. You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?. When my junk get to pumpin in the club it's on. I wink my eye at ya bitch,. if she smiles she gone. If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn. If you talking bout money homie,. I ain't concerned. I'm a tell you what Banks told me. cause go 'head switch the style up. If the niggas hate then let 'em hate. Watch the money pile up. Or we go upside their head. wit a bottle of bud.

Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV. From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P. Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball. We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all. We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall. If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call.

I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, BITCH. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. I told you fools before, I stay with the tools. I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels. I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused. She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes. I'm shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper. Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her. Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know. You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low. Bitch choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street. Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat. Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread. The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head. Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch. Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six. Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch. Catch a date, suck a dick, shiiit, TRICK. [Chorus]. Yeah, in Hollywoood they say there's no b'ness like show b'ness. In the hood they say, there's no b'ness like hoe b'ness ya know.

many men (wish death),"[Lloyd Banks]. Man we gotta go get something to eat man. I'm hungry as a motherfucker. [50 Cent]. Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son?. [Lloyd Banks]. 50, calm down, here he come. [9 Shots]. [Banks and 50]. Ahh, ohh, what the fuck!?. [50 Cent]. Ahh! son, pull up! pull up!. [Intro: 50 Cent - singing]. Many men, wish death upon me. Blood in my eye dawg and I can't see. I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be. And niggaz trying to take my life away. I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me. My back on the wall, now you gon' see. Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me. Cause I'll come and take your life away. Many men, many, many, many, many men. Wish death upon me. Lord I don't cry no more. Don't look to the sky no more. Have mercy on me. [Verse One]. Now these pussy niggaz putting money on my head. Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead. I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found. I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned. When I rhyme, something special happen every time. I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime. I walk the block with the bundles. I've been knocked on the humble. Swing the ox when I rumble. Show your ass what my gun do. Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head. Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs. I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder. Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over. [Chorus - singing]. Many men, many, many, many, many men. Wish death upon me. Lord I don't cry no more. Don't look to the sky no more. Have mercy on me. Have mercy on my soul. Somewhere my heart turned cold. Have mercy on many men. Many, many, many, many men. Wish death upon me. [Verse Two]. Sunny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain. Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain. Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard. It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred. This if for my niggaz on the block, twisting trees and cigars. For the niggaz on lock, doing life behind bars. I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear. Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years. I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don. Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm. Slim switched sides on me, let niggaz ride on me. I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back. I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat. In my nightmares, niggaz keep pulling techs on me. Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me. The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot. I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked. I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time. Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines. In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around. Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down. Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason. 'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing. [Chorus]"

hold on,"[50 Cent]. I woke up this morning, this is insane. Rich as a motherfucker and ain't much change. Open my eyes, no suprise, I'm with a different bitch. Different day, different ass, different tits. Strap under my pillow, I don't want legit. I'm not supposed to do this shit but I forget. The true principles of life are supply and demand. Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand. My man got knowledge of self, at my back God. Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off. My temper volatile, grew up a violent child. Fuck a boy scout - I air yo' ass out. Nigga nice chain, dice game, try your luck. Shoot a couple head cracks, leave you while you up. I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage. Gold medal 'round my neck like I won the Olympics. [Chorus]. We came from nothin, now they sayin we straight. Nigga hold up, hold on.... Hold on.... These niggaz they watchin every dime we make. Hold up, hold on.... Hold on.... [over Chorus]. You got that?. Let Yayo hold the strap son, it's cool. We got bail money, whatever. Y'all niggaz gotta chill. Just be cool about this shit, relax.

Hit the speed dial that quick, I'll get ya lined. Won't want your block, just cop the work from us. Them niggaz you call allies can't be trust. That Roley all gold, I got the Midas touch. Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff. On the phone I heard Yay' smacked the shit out a kid. Now Jimmy got life, go smack him again. When it's war, it will be war to the bitter end. If they ever say we lose, I start it again. That sneaky nigga sprayed that semi at yo' momma crib. With a silencer, we couldn't even hear the shit. [Chorus]. [over Chorus]. I don't fuck with them.

While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back. When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that. I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile. Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style. Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk. And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk. There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York. I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought. Separate C'mon. [Olivia]. I'm not affraid you explore my body. Oo give me that feeling now we can watch some tv. Or play a cd mabye that sexual healing. You try to sing to me but your never on the key. But u do it just to appese me. I'd rather spend my time wasting time with you. You ooooh you make it so easy. Cause if you were my best friend i'd want U round all the time. Can I be your best friend I promise boy you'll be mine. I said he's just a friend baby its not pretend either he is or he aint my man. I said he's just a friend. We been better then friends. For a long time. Aint no need to pretend. You'll always be mine. We been better then friends. For a long time. Aint no fibbing or faking. You'll always be mine. [Chorus].

Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the caddy. Now those were the days, where crime really pay. 9 milly spray, got the f**k out the way. The shootout, the shootout. The bricks went fast, robberies went bad, niggas got blast. Niggas kidnap Drew granpa kid. Came through and shot Ms Leak in the head. Wonder why I got a gun so I can get down for mine. You need that, out on the grind all the time. [Chorus - 50 Cent]. They say Im grimey, Im greasy. I make a 187 look easy. Fuck that, I lay my murder game down. Push me nigga, see what Im about.

Yeah, yeah I had a dream I was rich. Woke up broke, gun in my hand. Sayin' ""Damn!"" this dope cost 60 a gram. Have to find me a nigga, line me a nigga. And say ""Give it up kid, before I put one in ya wig"". Picture me thirsty, ridin' round foamin' out the mouth. Sayin' ""I dont get on"" Im'a lay a nigga out. Now diamonds are beautiful, pearls are precious. I hit ya in ya bitch, both go for ya necklace. Im so wreckless, I play the semi drunk off henny. Wipe your blood off the shines run and sell em to Benny. Fuck with me, ya niggas know Boo Boo get bizzy. [Chorus - 50 Cent]. They say Im grimey, Im greasy. I make a 187 look easy. Fuck that, I lay my murder game down. Push me nigga, see what Im about. They say Im grimey, Im greasy. I make a 187 look easy. Fuck that, I lay my murder game down. Push me nigga, see what Im about. [Verse 3 - 50 Cent]. I gave Jus a buck 50 ask him If I cut niggas. Shootouts in Bedford ask him If I bucked niggas. Four fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby. Hennysee and Cocaine, those remedies made me. My eyes dont cry, Im a fatherless child. Got my ass whooped in Spotford but never that now. When my name in ya mouth, better watch how you talk. Send yo punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk. I bust a clip Ill hit ya hip. Im take your shit. Thats how the esse's play, for that s.s.k. Your probably heard through the grape vine, Im good out Watts. Bulletproof shit, cruisin' through the Compton blocks. Im the beast from the east, but I play on the west. In the drop by myself with my gun and my vest. And you niggas best be on your best behaviours. I was bread for this shit, front Im'a blaze ya. [Chorus - 50 Cent]. They say Im grimey, Im greasy. I make a 187 look easy. Fuck that, I lay my murder game down. Push me nigga, see what Im about. They say Im grimey, Im greasy. I make a 187 look easy. Fuck that, I lay my murder game down. Push me nigga, see what Im about"

My album about to drop in 7 days. But I still poke a rapper at the VMA's. Kilo's in a gram, PO's be my fans. That's why I'm overseas doin shows in Japan. I got Gats from the future, see-through guns.

Yeah little motherfucker put the hammer in diesel. G-Unit Game Over this is only a preview. Niggas shittin' on theyself gotta rock in the huggy. The coke in the pot rise to the top like dougy. Got chicks with a ass like Buffy, yes homie trust me. Plays fuck me, kick 'em out when they try to get touchy. QB/Southside, if you wanted to Trestle. Man your man is hot, you dont wanna get next to. Like 50's beef is mine and mine is his. See this serious, motherfuckin ask them kids. Niggas wild on the streets, scared to death to bid. Sell anything that stay from the bottles and cuffs, nigga butt. [Billy Danze - Verse 7]. You about to witness an M.O.P thug out.

Like they aint used to open up for me in New York on tv (Ya know). Skip all chatter, and walk off Eazy. A milly will make your body looker look all measly. Ya bitch spotted me on the dolo and Im low-low. Damn near broke a monolo for a photo. I aint ridin' around with a Dodo that's a No-No. Momma taught me better than that you go to go home. Look at me now, a product of poverty. I cant watch the way I gotta decide a me. The 'hoods fulla hurt but that was a robbery. Critics owe me an apologee, Im probably. A sixteen away from the lottery. My niggas keep guns, thats one of the things I gotta be. Im wrapped up in a dome shit, cause nigga got all kinds of beef they want ya to come get. Im 2 steppin' with my weapon, cause they dont check 'em up. I know niggas from 'round there and they dont check us.

His man just got fucking murked by Salene. Heard he got it in the range nigga Bean popped one in his brain. Over some-thing took his watch and his chain. Country boys off the hook down there and Richmond main.. In the black 740 I sat, hat turned back. Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What!. I'm waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies. Son he smokin that shit I can see it in his eyes. Coming up wise emotions closed. Most buying round looking for wisemen toast. Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More. They sellin heroin in Maryland reverse back to Diesel. Killed like 4 fiends his popularity grew that only meant more cream. First it was him and his brother now he got a team. Went from 5 and a half grams to living the dream. City pulled up Goddamn you know his format. Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match. Got the gats out the stash box popped 2 glocks. Peace ""All Eyez on Me"" 2Pac. Everybody know he a boss he gotta floss. He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north. That's Dime in the blue ts stunting like he Nicky Barnes. He broke but he talk like he a Don. Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max haitian cat. Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack. I peep his style son I know his stelo, He on the d-low. He smile at niggaz mumbling fuck you in Creole. Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger. Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya. Few niggaz tried to murk him, most them got fount. Some turnt away try to run they in wheelchairs now. Banks hopped out bulletproof this, bulletproof that. Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat. Got out a Black hummer he blew 90 on that. Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that lets go."

Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya. See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin´, I got ya. Say a prayer for me if you care for me cuz I´m on the edge. I´m finna put a shell in a nigga head. I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it. The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it. Homie that took the hit on me couldn´t shoot this. Say I´m skinny now, but I look big in the coupe-dee. My cuzin Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again. Got shot the fuck up tryin´ to rob the wrong Mexicans. I write my lifestyle, y´all niggas is cheaters. Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva. Oh you the black hand of death, then why your name ain´t preacher. If you a pimp like kid, why them hoes don´t treat ya. If you wanna ball like Kirk, now shorty let me teach ya. This flow´s God sent, it´s bound to reach ya. [Hook]. Problem child, I´m familiar with problems. I know how to solve em. Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve em. Shoot em up, rob em. In the hood we starvin, you don´t want problems. Problem child. [Bridge] [Singing]. And why can´t you be man enough. To tell me where you´re comin´ from. [50 Cent]. They say you can never repay the price for takin´ a man´s life. I´m in debt with Christ, I done did that twice. I´m nice, y´all niggas can´t hang wit fifty. +Blaaat+, y´all niggas can´t bang wit fifty. Say I´m born to rhyme, there´s a shell and a nine. Face stone and the cross, there´s a bitch I tossed. See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course. You can check C-N-N for the ""War Report"". See the drama got me ridin´ with a sawed-off shottie. Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati. Man, niggas ain´t gon´ do me like Sammy did Gotti. I do it myself, I don´t need no help. Give me a knife, I´ll get rid of your neighborhood bully. Give me a minute, I´ll take a fuckin´ car with a pully. See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young. Niggas jumped me cuz they couldn´t beat me one-on-one. [Hook]. [Bridge]. [50 Cent]. I must´ve broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven. Cuz pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven. This cities split ´posed to let black cats cross your path. The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin´ your ass. I got ""God Understand Me"" tattooed in my skin. When I die, come back, I´ma tattoo it again. I´m the young buck that let the gun buck. Roll the window down and say: ""´Sup up, niggas get ready to duck"". My heart is a house homie, fear don´t live here. Nigga believe me when I say I don´t care. Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons. Even when my luck´s hard I still count my blessings. See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin´. Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon. If you pussy I´ma smell you when you come around here. Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn´t live in my tier. [Hook]"

When I'm out on bail, ridin' wit' some new ones. My homey told me to snitch the style up. Got 4 cats sent to jail, cause i told the cops. Now i gotta new diamond watch, and i wear vests on the block. I'ma snitch till im rich and theres no changin that. I used to sold crack? have to be a fool to believe that. They got my wearin vests and now im wearing them all the time. Did you just do a crime? Fifty's droppin the dime. When i get in jail the cops lemme right out. Cause i snitched on my best friend (eminem saying ""thats right""). It don't take long, for my snitchin to sink in. [Chorus - repeat 2X]. You're thicker than water. Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa. You're thicker than water. Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa. You're thicker than water. Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa.

I got a love affair, wit' violence and guns. When I got O'd up, my heart turned colder. That's why the mac react like a king cobra. Now I'm jumpin' out of Rovers, in Gucci loafers. Y'all niggas wanna stun? I'll bury you cockroaches. Gimme one year, in this industry. I'll buy enough guns to declare war on a small country. [Chorus]. [Lloyd Banks]. Still walk around wit' the hammer boss. Rope and a cross. Hard times'll make a lil' nigga hate Santa Claus. Your mountains is high, holdin' in Diana Ross. I'm like a 2003 banana Porsche. I don't gotta hide sluts, to get your ties cut. My team in the cutt, packin' middle things. I got more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings. It's 8 class karats in the border. I poke holes in plastic, to avoid a vaginal disorder. I'm a savage on your daughter. She ain't in the college dorm. Then I guess I'm squirtin' on the cabin that you bought her. I'm a heavy weed smoker, so the average is a quarter. Brown colored from shit, he established in the water. You got Banks on your jersey, you part of my fan base. Just 'cause you pour syrup on shit, don't make it pancakes. [Chorus]."

So if you jeapordize it I got the right. To send a mothafucka at you tonight. G-unit! and I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'. Swimmin' in barrels of money.

Take your hats off, you know you ain't that tough. I'm callin' your bets off as soon as you act up. You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball. Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (lloyd banks!). By the way, this feels like I'm dreamin'. Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen. The physical presence of a female, form of a demon. That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em. Get my nut while I'm breathin'. 'cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'. That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?. You trippin', more records could get my ass in position. Death wish for no religion whether catholic or christian. Listen, I went through my ambition in and out the kitchen. With probable cause, it's probably sendin' out to prison. You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours. We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards. [tony yayo]. You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me ('cause what? ). 'cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto. Niggas hate when you do good. But when you broke, your friends and your enemies. They love you, they love you. Cheche, get the llello. Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail. Cheche, get the llello. Picture me being crack (tony yayo!). You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie. I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country. Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low. White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow. It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane. I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble. I'll make your money double. Cook me in baking soda. I'll turn your hooprock into a new range rover. I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator. Feed your family, turn your man into a hater. Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox. Put me in your nik's, timbs or reeboks. If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards. Cop a hundred grams, you movin' forwards. You tryin' to move more birds. ...in pa all day, on the corner of third. [50 cent]. You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what? ). 'cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto. Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you. The shells hit you, you screamin'. Think I'm playin'? I mean it. Man, I done bought all these pistols. Lets get it poppin'. Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (c'mon). Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide. I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'. I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants. As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned. Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons. I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish. I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like 50 nice chain. Malasio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game. Burn out, can't stop gotta watch mtv, bet. Nigga you see me!. I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good. Or 'cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood. And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back. 'cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat. You pussy. Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga. They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga. Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga. Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga. Read the daily news nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga. I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit. Pussy, lets get it poppin'"

But before I go, do that little dance, yeah, just like that. It's late, I have to score, 'This blue drink tastes good, don't it?'. 'Sure it does, now have some more'. I'm deep, but she got her ladies wit her. So bring em, I'll call ya a babysitter. So we can hit the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn. I'm contemplatin' how my time's spent.

'Cause, see, they don't KNOW me.. Delicious- Do they know me?. Okay, I thought so.. 'Cause YOU know I know karate.. And I will see him, and I will Jet-Li his ass."

You puttin pressure on me when you compare me to Pac. I'm just a new kid, I can't help it I'm hot. What a little nigga say to 50 cent don't matter. I'll fire shots at the ship and then watch the sheeps scatter. my enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn to enemies. you scared then get the fuck around me. Record execs, know not to play wit my check. I come through and pull my knife on that pain your neck (YEAH!). [Chorus]. I don't like you, you don't like me. Its not likely that we'll ever be friends.

Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game. Still niggas acting like I don't get down or something. Like I aint the next nigga to wear the crown or something. You gonna talk about your chips till we run in your crib. And you gone ask dumb questions like ""Can I Live?"". Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous. If you shoot me your brainless, you said it yourself. I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you. Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you. Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell. I've done told Ton and Pok? they better have my bail. But if its over a mil don't put the crib up dun. Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gonna run. [Chorus] 2x. It's best you be a gentleman. and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh, nigga take that). Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend. (bo! bo! bo! bo! bo!...It's gangsta). [50 Cent]. Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a po' no mo'. I ain't gotta steal from the corna' store no mo'. Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the flo' no mo'. Bouncers don't try to play me at the do' no mo'. But when they see me they say search him. ""He might have the nine. He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne"". It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this. Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this. Niggas is feelin' it. The Benz pullin up on the set (uh huh). Me jumpin out 30 tho on my neck (uh huh uh huh). And since you said it was nothin' to sweat (what). That you was outta line so here's what you get. A verbal ass kickin'. Jesus Christ sent me to test ya. Let's see how see how he act's under pressure. Till Makaveli returns it's 'All Eyez On Me'. Till the feds build up cases and find pie's on me. [Chorus] 2x. It's best you be a gentleman. and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh bwahh, bwahh nigga take that). Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend. (bo! bo! bo!, It's gangsta). It's gangsta, 2000 shit. (Echoing). Ya'll know what you need to do, get together,. make a We Are The World record, faggot ass niggas)."

beg for mercy,"G G G, G G G-Unit. No peace talks, no white flags. No mercy, I'm gettin yo ass. [50 Cent]. Niggas done heard about my click how we stay wit the toastas. Blood in, blood out, la kostra nostra. You don't wanna bang wit the best. I'll have Doc removin fragments from your chest. They say God's a forgivin' man, I hope he forgive. Thirty shells I let off don't curse my kid. They say Fifty done blew up, Fifty you changed. Nigga you stunt, I pull out. And you see I'm that same nigga that when he start to roar. I think he's flyin. Eight outta eight on movin targets. You run? You still dyin. Check my resume, I am oh so loco. Mama ain't raise no chump, I don't talk no pocco. [Chorus - Tony Yayo]. Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me. But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy. Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin for it too. Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks. Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me. But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy. Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin for it too. Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks. [Tony Yayo]. There once was some niggas that tried to murda me. I hit em up, put em in plastic surgery. This 4-5 has made a lot of guys apologize. The truth come out, 'stead of hearin' a lot of lies. Some niggas catch a case and then claim they hard. A couple chest wounds will make a nigga change his heart. I just play my part, and while you shootin up cars. I'm smokin' niggas like a Cuban cigar. Let's get it poppin'. [Chorus]. [Lloyd Banks]. I'm tired of you niggas with your maybe beef. We gonna be here forever, you're temporary like baby teeth. I'm in and out the night clubs, A-D-D. Dark blue Benz, navy seats, eighty sneaks. These niggas tellin' out the blue. So you hang em off the bridge. At least they'll have to helicopter you. The Jimmy lived in the bags, the Bell or Hop will do. I rap for the neighborhood niggas that failed in high school. You can tell I came a long way in my sense, home grown. That's why them little niggas in the projects love me. You provide the beat downs for free, I paid my dues. I don't even freestyle for free. I gave em a break, flew over seas. But it's kinda hard to get homie-sick when there's blue in the. trees. Sit back and try to play your role wit the copies. I put more staples in yo ass than a telephone pole, Yea. [Chorus]"

betta ask somebody,"[50 Cent]. I, know, you, know. I'm, on, fiiiii-re. [Chorus: 50 Cent]. If, you don't know, who I be. You betta ask somebooooody about me. Oh - you wanna be tough nigga, a look is enough. I put that snub nose to ya and bust nigga. If, you don't know, who I be. You betta ask somebooooody about me. And they'll tell ya I'm a soldier boy. And I done told ya, over and over boy. [Verse One: Lloyd Banks]. I come from a big city, the streets corrupt. Now I'm rollin with snub-noses to heat you up. Out here niggaz'll do anything to reach a buck. Cause when you broke you can't afford to fuck ya sneakers up. I take my time, keep my mind on my bank funds. Learn how to seperate the real from the fake ones. And on my heater nina rep what could I carry on. My nigga just lost his momma, and his daddy gone. From now on I can provide cause my paper's straight. Family losin his legs, but I can take the weight. Some niggaz hate but I'll be damned if they hold me down. Front niggaz didn't know me then, bet they know me now. Blunt and a smile, eventually it'll be a frown. Cause every time I turn around a nigga locked down. While I'm in the world, tryin to bring my loot through. Hopin one day we can kick it like we used to, my nigga. [Chorus]. [Verse Two: Young Buck]. Uhh, they never seen 26's on a Hummer. My goal is to try to fuck Trina by the summer. Some niggaz hate me, but they only made me. Go and put mo' ice in my mouth than Baby (bling bling!). G-Unit and Shady, them dudes is crazy. Next time, we only usin Dr. Dre's beats. Fuck you, pay me, take your magazine flicks. This ain't no Nelly hurr, take a good look at this. Got the wrists of a chemist and the heart of a hustler. Plus I probably done robbed mo' artists than Russell. Always in trouble, you can blame my mother. Gave birth to a gorilla and raised him in the jungle. I ain't crawled, I stumbled across the Mexican with birds. Papi had coke and new plates and pounds of herb. Keep my hand on my glock, and my ear to the streets. I'm a country boi, you can hear it when I speak. G-Unit!. [Chorus]. [Verse Three: 50 Cent]. Bentley is all dreams, G-5 is understood. I made a nigga heart colder than December (yeah!). Don't take much to make my gun go off. One shot'll make a hardrock look oh so soft (woo!). If you don't know you betta ask who I be. Or end up in ICU gettin fed through a IV. Down in the Lou', they say they feelin me derrty. In New Orleans they say I'm that nigga, ya heard me?. From them Southside blocks to Watts, Westside don't front. You know about them Grapestreet Gangstas, G'd up. Rollin that weed up. Nigga get outta line, get shot stabbed jacked. Hit with a bat or beat up. Fuck that, we're on that same bullshit. Same forty-cally glock, same full clip. Pussy claat bwoy, ya nah wanna tak wif me. I'm a real rudebwoy, ya nah wanna ruf wif me. [Chorus]"

big rich town (feat. joe),"[Joe]. They say this is a big, rich town. I just come from the poorest part. Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it. This is where it goes down. I just happen to come up hard. Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it. [50 Cent]. I never took a straight path nowhere. Life's full of twist and turns. Bumps and bruises, I lived, I learned. I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers. It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper. Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven. That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven. Pure snow, bag it then watch it go. Occupational options, guess I'm blowing some hoes. Shoot the bullet, the strap, learned to rap with a jack. Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack. This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce. That 007, that 62 on my count. I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers. Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''. You're my inspiration, you're my motivation. You're the reason that I'm moving with no hesitation. [Joe]. They say this is a big, rich town. I just come from the poorest part. Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it. This is where it goes down. I just happen to come up hard. Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it. [50 Cent]. I gotta hustle through the hustle. And bust while I make a move. Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school. Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop. Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots. I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit. Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip. My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties. I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds. All I got is my word, balls and my instinct. I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think. We already on top, I got a bigger plan. No more control substances or hand to hand. White collar visions, game changing mission. Big wrists, big wins, keep on bigger living. Perfect position, watch me transition. From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky. [Joe]. They say this is a big, rich town. I just come from the poorest part. Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it. This is where it goes down. I just happen to come up hard. Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it"

One pair at a time, till your shoe games sick. Now who knows what the future holds, we'll be together probably. For better or worst, like Whitney and Bobby. If you wanna play house, we can play house then. But wait why pretend if you can move in. Before I be your buddy in bed, let me be your best friend. Girl, its more than lust, I want your trust. You keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you. Cause I know with you by my side, there's nothin' I can't do. [Chorus x2- Jamie Foxxx]. Baby I'll build you up.

You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making. [Kidd Kidd]. I'm clean as a motherfucker, still getting my hands dirty. Bitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you looking thirsty. See I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B singers. I'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker. Mask on, lone ranger, scope on the K, lone ranger. Rather be alive and rich than die and be famous. Live my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything. I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing. Rims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga. Trying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame. You chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper. Niggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper. I'm gone. I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling. A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making. [Prodigy]. She on my leg like a little kid. She hump my leg like a horny pit. Pitbull in a skirt, yeah, I'm a magnet. Now I ain't running after no broads, she stuck on my dick. I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes. Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green. She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why. Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind. Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun. You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look. There ain't a bitch more dime than me. The thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me. While you. I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling. A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making. [Styles P]. Ghetto niggas still'll pick a penny up. You outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up. Little homie loading a semi up. Catch him all after the club, tell him to ante up. Anyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way. You owe me, you better pay. Ghost, let the beretta spray. Hood want uncut dope and some better yay. I ain't chasing pussy, never have. Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass. Still robbing, still rolling, still need a mask. Still popping, still slinging, still need the cash. I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling. A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You chase the hoes, I chase the paper. You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making"

Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe. Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves. Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?. I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us. Ladies love us and my boss's kicking up dust. It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk. [Verse 1 - Eminem]. Back with Andre The Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk. Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust. Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus. Kiss my butt, lick my under cheese from under my nuts. It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks. It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed. Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut. Missed the cut, the lady give a (?) some paper cut. Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought. 'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft. If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time. Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes. It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room. I venture to say with the same repetition is true. Not to mention back with a vengeance and hit the signal. Of the bat symbol. The platinum dude is back on you hoes. [Eminem]. Ladies and gentlemen... Dr. Dre!. [Verse 2 - Dr. Dre]. They see that low rider go by there, like Â""Oh my! Â"".

I love LA. Cuz over and above all, it's just another day. And this one begins where the last one ends. Pick up where we left off and get smashed again. I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz. Driving around with a smashed front end. Let's cash that one in. Grab another one from out the stable. The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado. The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?. Decisions, decisions. Garage looks like precision collision. Or Maico beats quake like Waco. Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though. [Chorus - Eminem]. So crack a bottle, let your body waddle. Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto.

curtis 187,"[50 Cent]. Ay nigga tell 'em where you from!. Southside, I'm a Southside nigga what. Nigga stunt, you know I tear a nigga up. [Chorus]. They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy. I make a one-eight-seven look easy. Fuck that~! I lay my murder game down. Push me nigga, see what I'm about. [50 Cent]. I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtball nigga. Sayin I can't wait 'til I get a little bigger. After niggaz jumped me, bumpin my head. Thinkin I wish I had a gun I fill a nigga with lead. Took a kitchen knife to {*censored*} fin' to poke me a nigga. Wishin I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga. Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley. Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the Caddy. Now those were the days, when crime really paid. The nine milli sprayed, I got the fuck out the way. From shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast. Robberies went bad, niggaz got blast. Niggaz kidnapped Drew grandpa kid. Came through and shot Ms. Leak in the head. You wonder why I got a gun? So I can get down for mine. You need that, out on the grind all the time. [Chorus] - repeat 2X. [50 Cent]. It was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids. Doo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades. Ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed. Hoodrats to get laid, money to get made. YEAHHH~! .. Yeah I had a dream. I was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand. Sayin DAMN! .. Dope cost sixty a gram. I got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga. And say ""Give it up kid, before I put one in your wig"". Picture me thirsty, ridin 'round foamin out the mouth. Sayin ""I don't get on, I'ma lay a nigga out"". Now diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious. I hit you and your bitch both over your necklace. I'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny. Wipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny. Fuck with me, y'all niggaz know Boo Boo get bizzy. [Chorus] - repeat 2X. [50 Cent]. Yeah. I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggaz. Shootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggaz. In four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby. Hennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me. My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child. Got my ass whooped in Spofford but never that now. When my name in your mouth, you better watch how you talk. I'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk. I bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit. Thats how the eses play, for that SSK. Your probably heard through the grapevine, I'm good out in Watts. Bulletproof shit, cruisin through them Compton blocks. I'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West. In the drop by myself with my nine and my vest. And you niggaz best be on yo' best behaviors. I was bred for this shit, front on me I'ma blaze ya. [Chorus] - repeat 2X"

She good if I leave her she got her own visa,. Think about them when you about frontin. Think about stuntin when you think about me,. I'm the boss Bentley or the Porsche,. Overseas jet skis slide across,. I love the way you dress,. Now take it off,. Put your legs high on my shoulders across,. I'm racing through your mind but you've already lost,. I'm at the finish line and you're the friend of mine, come on let's ride. [Chorus]. Just a lil bit. Everynow and then. God damn girl we used to be friends. Just a lil bit. Just a lil bit.

I'm thinking what this b-tch thinking when she take me to court,. I pay my child support, what the f-ck she want,. This relationship, shit it's too much for me,. I wanna f-ck your friends and live comfortably. She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees,. She should have what she wants just not for me,. I'm thinking bout my future she's part of my past,. She don't care bout me she just want some cash,. I'm thinking damn girl, we used to be friends,. How did sh-t become all about m's. [Chorus].

Flows, bones, crushing it's nothing. I come up with something. Come through your strip, fronting, stunting. It's something you want, 745 chrome spinning. Haters hate that I'm winnning. Man I've been hot from the beginning. Motherfuckers aim at the kid, control your jealousy. 'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fitting to catch a felony. Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it popping. Once I squeeze the first shot. No I aint stopping till my clip is empty. I'm simply not that nigga you should try your luck with.

These niggas don't want me balling, they want me bury. Thrown in the dirt, from shots flurry. Laying with bugs under my shirt. I got plans to hop up in that Hummer. 'Cause I'mma stunner, I sit back and wonder. When them angels gon' call my number. Under, my chest is a heart of a lion. I ain't lieing , bounty hunters got me flying. With my iron, high as a giant. I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching. What I'm clutching, to give you more then a concussion. End of discussion. My blood is colder, so I'm bolder. And it's either soda. Hood on my my shoulder. Looking in the mirror, I see a soldier. [50 Cent]. Right now I'm on the edge. So don't push me. I aim straight for your head. So don't push me. Fill your ass up with lead.

This is me who's gotta be. What you see on TV. What you hear on CD. What appears easy. Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers. In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies. Fronting like it's all fun and games. Till they shoot 'em up bang. Then you see brains hang and you see we ain't playing. Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying. I bully my way in this game, man I'm done playing. Man I'm done saying that I'm done playing. I'mma start laying any of these motherfucking cocksuckers. There's no way I'mma back down, like a goddamn coward. I can't, how would I look as man bowing to his knees. Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me. And not lash back out at 'em, please. Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me. Not Marshall, you wanna see Marshall?. I'll show you Marshall, I try to show you art. Put you just pick it apart, so I see I have to start. Showing you fucken old farts a whole other side. I wanted to not show you, so you know you're not dealing with. Some fucken marshmellow, little soft yellow. Punk pussy, who's heart's Jello, 'cause. [50 Cent]. Right now I'm on the edge. So don't push me. I aim straight for your head. So don't push me.

Red I flight the night. From L.A. to N.Y.. I'm Harlem bound. You see how bitches tense up, when Scarlett 'round. Niggas get the heart to holla while we up in the club. But get intimidated when they see me sitting on dubs. I hear 'em whispering "" dat ain't a man, shit that's. her."". She roll with them G Unit niggas, that's what's up. Disrespect me, I'll have niggas blast ya up. Take my advice, don't let ya peoples grass ya up. I got a fetish for the chips. 20's for the six. Hollows for the clips. Try me, if you think I'm playing bitch. And the police we'll have another crime scene taker. Jim Star crush your head, give your ass a shape-up. Uptown niggas known for the money they make.

I slid through the front door. With the 9 and the velour. A cal in my pocket. You wil', I'mma pop it. I'm down for a profit. I'm ghetto as hell. You can't you tell?. My road dog, under the jail. Getting frustrating mail. So I'm drinking and smoking. Thinking and hoping. This cell gon' open. You can dance next to me, but don't throw an elbow. I'll throw one back and leave blood on your Shell Toes. Hell no. I ain't paying for pleasure. Your pussy don't bring rainbows and pots of treasure. It's every girl's dream, to floss with the team. Long limousine. DVD's on the screen. Blowing on cream. Waiting for you to scheme. You ain't gotta know how to read, to spray a magazine. [Hook]. [Tony Yayo]. I don't wanna grow up, I'mma hustler kid. Go'head and stunt, see I don't pop two your wig. I'm artistic, intelligent, so much ability. When I use them big words, your bitch be feeling me. So ya'll niggas hate me, 'cause your wives be our groupies. Ya'll irritate me, like loud people in the movies. Fall back, matter fact back down. 'Cause I just passed security without no pat down. You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky. Or catch me on the dancefloor feeling some tits. Sex sells, so I'mma P-I-M-P. So my pockets never be empty. It ain't no problem, we scoop them models. We got condoms, coups, and lavish condos. 50 got me getting ass like I never did. So when I step in the club, hoes love the kid. [Hook]. [50 Cent]. The cat in the house go. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. The bird in the cage go. Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet. It's elementary"

We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all. We could really splurge girl and tear up the mall. If ever you needed someone, I´m the one you should call. I´ll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall. If you got problems I can solve´em, they big or they small. That other nigga you be with ain´t bout shit. I´m your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch. [chorus]. I told you fools before, I stay with the tools. I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels. I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused. She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes. I´m shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper. Man this hoe you can have her, when I´m done I ain´t gon keep her. Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know. You saying it´s secret, but you ain´t gotta keep it on the low. Bitch choose on me, I´ll have you stripping in the street. Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat. Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread. The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head. Get your hoe out of pocket, I´ll put a charge on a bitch. Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six. Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain´t paying bitch. Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick. [chorus]. Yeah, in Hollywoood they say there´s no b´ness like show b´ness. In the hood they say, there´s no b´ness like hoe b´ness ya know. They say I talk a lil fast, but if you listen a lil faster.

Went from rags to riches to gettin' ass from bitches. That saw me grasp the situation at hand, when you used to have to ask for digits. Now they pass it to you like easy, fast pick-tickets. Classic, isn't it? Comin' from a past with a casket. Dip somethin' beneath the grass so you're cremated to ashes, nigga. Created from the crab, this is past fictitious. Fif, tell 'em how it was when we last done visit. Chorus (x 2). [50 Cent]. [Obie Trice]. And now the spotlight's on Trice. But back when the spot life was Trice. I always kept aside a spot for a mic, despite wrongs and rights. I would write after I slung white to homes on the 'pike. I had a notion I would be bi-coastal. But being across the ocean is la vida loca. And va do loco, I'm in ???. Kinicheewa in Tokyo and Sushi with eel. I got a taste for that ??? he's choppin' up in Brazil. Drinkin' the finest wines in France on the hill. Now, how real is he to come from where we get killed. To havin' all his dreams fulfilled. Look out, I got fantasies of bein' in Italy where the women be. Offerin' me ???, eatin' on Arsobuco. Awesome, I know. So often, we just reach the coffin and never get to see what the world's offerin'. Chorus (x 2). [50 Cent]. [50 Cent]. Yeah, things change, man. You know, get a chance to travel. See the world, you start to look at things a little different. [Obie Trice]. I ain't bullshittin' you. 'Cause I aint never thought I'd see it out the hood. Huh, look at a nigga now"

Shoot an ace off your foot, that's some shit you should get shot for. Fuck it, when I win I'm a winner – when I lose, I'm a winner. ‘Cause to my niggas y'all niggas lookin' like steak dinner. You screw your face the fuck up, you goin' through what?. The strap big enough in my truck to chew your crew up. Nigga stand down or get manned down. Mack, two clips, 30 rounds plus 30 rounds, flip it around. You gon' fuck around and get jammed up, blammed up. Hit your spine, a standup nigga can't even stand up. [Hook]. I'm dreamin' of….

Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons,. talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope, y. ou got a smile that only a fool would forget. and a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit. there I was, kickin' my game. pickin' her brain. buggin' 'cause a while back I met this bitch on the train. she wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the. whip. Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit. but on the sidewalk we ain't play games. we exchanged numbers and names. I went back to the Range. I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' ""I know that nigga, he. rich"". she think I got six whips 'cause me and my Man switch. anyway, her name is CeCe. she said she go to BMCC. push a '98 328 with chrome BB's. she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV. she liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me.. Chorus. Verse 2:. It's hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya. type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya. they into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls. these trick niggas fucked up, they done gave 'em the World. Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?. oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?. nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?. platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit. I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it. that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it. know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends. probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz. I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints. Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not. long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop. it goes on and on and on and it don't stop.. Chorus. Verse 3:. One thing you can always count on is change. and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game. had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range. would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change. now it's hard to find us or stay behind us. while we on the 900 double R Hondas. watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips. while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs. all these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World. you can find a material Girl. I sip Dom 'till I earl. take 'em two at a time. quick I get in they mind. have 'em thinkin' they mine. bust off then tell 'em ""Bust a Uey, on mo' time"". I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year. got your bitch breakin' her neck to peep this here. c'mon..uh huh...c'mon.. Chorus 2x. (Dave Hollister).

Big Pun ""I'm even, even better than before"". Styles ""I don't give a fuck who you are"". Nas ""Niggaz is this and that, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just the best"". [Verse]. Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy. Or I could feel the world turnin'. I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin'. Comin' up, I was taught never back down. That's why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down. 32 shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left. Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death. They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie. Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em. There's a lot of talk in the streets about me. Niggaz know, ain't nothing sweet about me. Get back to questions, like ""50, who shot ya?.... You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah, Tah?"". Nigga, street shit should stay in the street. So, keep it on the low. But everybody who's somebody already know. A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up. My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up. LET'S GO. [Chorus (Different Variations)]. [Verse]. Maaaaaaaaan. I told niggaz not to fuck with me they still push me. Figured they'd get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy. I been gone through static, shot at with automatics. Since 90, when Nas came out with ""Illmatic"". If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me. Cause Tommy Matola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me. I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny. Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny. With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care. Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here. My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy. That's why you bitch like me, so I'm a heavyweight. How dare these niggaz take me lightly?. I ain't come to make friends and niggaz aint gotta like me. My own homie said ""50, you done lost yo' mind"". Cause I shootout in broad day, run and toss my nine. [Chorus (Different Variations)]. [Verse]. Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say ""50 ain't hot"". When I drop, I'm sound like Eminem and Kid Rock. Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up. Jukes me, A week later y'all be shot the fuck up. Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy. This aint how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me. The D's call me by my government name. I be dumb and shoot up parks. Have niggaz runnin' like ""Jesus Comin'"". There's wet pillows in prison, niggaz cry in the dark. Cause if they did in the day, niggaz would question they heart. So when they come home, the come home. Walking that tough walk, talking that ""Rockavalede"". Talk'll get you shot in New York - BBBBLLLLATTTTT. Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat. But I aint tryin do +Hard Time+ like +Pistol P+. See, niggaz uptown understand me in the street. You niggaz uptown'll ""Stan"" me in the street. Ha-ha. [Chorus (Different Variations)]."

Slim chance I'ma go back to killing roaches. Be quiet, you can hear the rats in the wall. Make you want to pump crack til you stack racks. The dope bring the dough in, shawn sister, she hoeing. Like Brenda with her baby, she six months, she showing. For 50 should suck that, for a buck you could fuck that. And you thinking she nasty, but niggas is nasty. Dice game shake em up, praying for a six. The wolves out there hungry, they looking for a lick. Sun down to sun up, they looking for a come up. 10-30 in progress right in your projects. They boosting, you like Gucci, they got it. Spot it, and every other high end product. I put you on, my man's man, got a credit card scam. Come through later, I'ma plug you in fam. Niggas pissed on the staircase in an elevator. Now I'm pissed cause I'm starting to smell like this player. My little man get bread, I tell you what he doing. He bag up for days till cocaine in his urine. His momma got bills he avoiding the eviction. He play lookout and warn niggas when the dicks coming. [Hook]. You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker. Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker. You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker. Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker. You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker. Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker. You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker. Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker. [Verse 2]. Mikey put his foot to a bitch ass on some pimp shit. 10 hoes, 10 g's a night, niggas getting rich. Any nigga get out of line, I got 'em. Southside across my back, I'm from the bottom. All a nigga need is a block and a connect. And a box of 9mm's to load in the tech. The beef all gravy, a nigga half crazy. You pull it, better bang it. Cause niggas will bring it. That kush moving faster than crack, nigga its burning. Now move a couple pounds of that, now you're earning. Stack paper on every flip, get the whip. Than get a new bitch and forget the one you with. She said she could do bad all by her damn self. Nigga let her do bad all by her damn self. A bitch'll tell when the pigs come. Won't even try to make bail when the pigs come. Just let her do her own thing. [Hook]"
ghetto quran,"(talking). Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh. Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty south?. One time. (Chorus). Lord forgive me, for I've sinned. Over and over again, just to stay on top. I recall memories, filled with sin. Over and over again, and again. Yo, when you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team. See niggas feared Prince and respected Prim'. For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller. See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer. Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh. This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit. The roll with Easy Rider and they ain't get blunted. Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred. As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack. I used to idolize cat. Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pat. how he go out like that?. Rumors in the hood was ?? was snitchin. I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX-R. Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3. Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis. From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be suprised. Of how freely I thought of names of games who dealt with pies. Like L-A-N-Y's, L got shot in the neck, then told us connect. Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks. Fuckin Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks. (Chorus). That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on. Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Quran. I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe. And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose. Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin. Life's a bitch, with a pretty face, but she burnin. Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar. Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata. Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facin. Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Patty Mason. A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth. Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth. I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall. Together niggas stand and divided they fall. Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion. Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean. Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold. Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louie VaTonne interior. Might sound like I'm fantasizin, but son I'm dead serious. Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to watch the money. Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian. FEDs couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion. (Chorus). Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo. The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo. Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey. Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky Cally. Rodney Bump and Chick, shit. A lot a niggas flow the way I flow. but ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know. Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel. If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail. Comin up I heard sippin to much booze'll leave you confused. And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose. I'm forgettin Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance. Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags. And a conversation over shrimp and lobster. And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin, and started robbin diners. Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will. If the flow don't kill you the Mac will."

hate it or love it,"Yea. Let's take'em back. Uh huh. Coming up I was confused. My mama kissing a girl. Confusion occurs. Coming up in a cold world. Daddy aint around. Probably out committing felonies. My favorite rapper used to sing. Check, check out my melody. I wanna live good so shit I sell dope. For a four-finger ring. One of them gold ropes. Nana told me if I passed I get a sheep skin coat. If I could move a few packs. I get the hat. Now that'll be dope. Tossed and turn in my sleep that night. Woke up the next morning. Niggaz done stole my bike. Different day, same shit. Ain't nothing good in the hood. I run away from this bitch. And never come back if I could. Hate it or love it the underdog's on top. And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop. Go head'n envy me. I'm rap's Mvp. And I ain't going no where. So you can get to know me. G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit. On the grill of my low rider. Guns on both sides. Right above the gold wires I four-five1em. Kill a nigga on ma song. And really do it. That's the true meaning of a ghostwriter. Ten g'z will take your daughter outta air forces. Believe you me homie, I know all about losses. I'm from Compton, where the wrong colors, be cautious. One phone call, have your body dumped in Marcy. I stay strapped like car seats. Been banging since ma lil nigga,rob, got killed for his Barkley's. That's ten years. I told Pooh in 95. I'll kill you if you try me for my air-max 95's. Told Banks when I met'em I'm a ride. And if I gotta die, rather homicide. I ain't had 50 cent when ma grand-mama died. Now I'm going back to Cali with ma jacob on. See how time fly?. Hate it or love it the underdog's on top. And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop. Go head'n envy me. I'm rap's Mvp. And I ain't going no where. So you can get to know me. From the beginning to the end. Losers lose, winners win. This is real we aint gotta pretend. The cold world that we in. It's full of pressure and pain. Enough of me nigga now listen. Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench. Now I'm fucking with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense. My Ma's happy, she aint gotta pay the rent. And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz. Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the range. Thinking how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes. When there's kids starving. Pac is gone,and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage. I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin. No school books. They use their wood to build coffins. Whenever I'm in a booth. And I get exhausted. I think what if Marie Bank had got that abortion. I love you Ma. Hate it or love it the underdog's on top. And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop. Go head'n envy me. I'm rap's Mvp. And I ain't going no where. So you can get to know me"

Gritted my teeth fo' ya, G-G-G'd fo ya. Put Compton on my back when you was in need of. soldiers. At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold. And had the whole crowd yellin' free Yayo. So niggas better get up outta mine. Before I creep and turn ya projects into Collumbine. And I'm rap's MVP. Don't make me remind ya'll what happened in D.C.. This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend. Mad at us, cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend. And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse. This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly. south.

How many of them boys is with ya. When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a. picture. I'm walkin' with a snub, cause niggas do a lotta slip. talkin' in. the club. Till they coughin' on the rug, ain't never had much. but a. walkman and a bub. My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug, bad. enough they. want me to choke. My boy just got poked in the throat, now its a ?? in. my coat. Now I'm ?? reminiscin', holdin' my weed in never. listen. If I see him an ?? and maybe that'll even the score. And if not, then that'll be me on the floor. [Chorus x2- 50 Cent (Then Tony Yayo)]. Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop. And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops. Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP. And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me. [Verse 4- Tony Yayo]. I started out at fifteen, scared as hell. I took thirty off a pack and I made them sell. As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot. With that little duece duece and my triple fat goose. Sippin' easy Jesus rockin' the laces. Mama with me and when she found my pieces. I look back on life and think God I bless. We the best on the planet so forget the rest. [Verse 5- Young Buck]. You know I'm still nice with my cooked game. Look mayn, its a hood thang thats why I'm loved in. Brooklyn. I handle mine just like a real nigga should. If I do some time, homie I'm still all good. Let me show what a thug that born to die. I took the bullets outta 50 and put 'em in my four. five. And I ain't even got my feet wet yet. A seven figure nigga who ain't seen awards to check. bitch. [Chorus x2- 50 Cent (Then Young Buck)]. Hate it or love, the underdog's ontop. And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops. Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's MVP. And I ain't goin' no where so you can get to know me"

Don't wanna get knocked, for sixty rocks in a sock. You know the ghetto's red hot, gots to shot that on my block. I keep it strictly business, it's unfinished if there's a witness.

Different day, different ass, different tits. Strap under my pillow, I don't want legit. I'm not supposed to do this shit but I forget. The true principles of life are supply and demand. Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand. My man got knowledge of self, at my back God. Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off. My temper volatile, grew up a violent child. Fuck a boy scout - I air yo' ass out. Nigga nice chain, dice game, try your luck. Shoot a couple head cracks, leave you while you up. I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage. Gold medal 'round my neck like I won the Olympics. [Chorus]. We came from nothin, now they sayin we straight. Nigga hold up, hold on.... Hold on.... These niggaz they watchin every dime we make. Hold up, hold on.... Hold on.... [over Chorus]. You got that?. Let Yayo hold the strap son, it's cool. We got bail money, whatever. Y'all niggaz gotta chill. Just be cool about this shit, relax. [50 Cent]. We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view. Instead we get the D's in the rear view. We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played. And so you know you violate you supposed to be sprayed. It's not a big deal to me, stay calm. I'll shoot the shit out a nigga then call the barrel Bonds. If I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done. Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we are one. Used to do graffiti, now look, we major. Don't make me write my name 'cross your face with a razor. Re-up, new joke, they said this sample the bomb. This shit can take a two then we cut the bitch with a one, uhh. Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency. No lactose involved, pure cocoa leaf. You can sniff that or cook that to my belief. That money comin in like we run the streets. [Chorus]. [over Chorus]. That's a bet. Find my form better. Nigga you got a gamblin problem.

Hit the speed dial that quick, I'll get ya lined. Won't want your block, just cop the work from us. Them niggaz you call allies can't be trust. That Roley all gold, I got the Midas touch. Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff. On the phone I heard Yay' smacked the shit out a kid. Now Jimmy got life, go smack him again. When it's war, it will be war to the bitter end. If they ever say we lose, I start it again. That sneaky nigga sprayed that semi at yo' momma crib. With a silencer, we couldn't even hear the shit. [Chorus]. [over Chorus]. I don't fuck with them. Pssh, man, these niggaz is roaches man. Dirty ass niggaz. Boy you better be easy. I ain't playin wit'chu boy. Boy you must've bumped yo' motherfuckin head or somethin boy.

Nigga now get the bread, I fill ya ass up with lead. I put a hole in ya wig with the SIG ya dig. Shouldn't fuck with the kid. I don't play that shit.

Always takes so long when ya hit. It won't be long for ya dead"

Got through the silver duck tape on my 38. handle. The women on my life bring confusion shit. SO like Nino from New Jack, I'll have to cancel that bitch. Look at me, this is the life I chose. Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze up. Yo the empire on the low the narc's don't know I'm the weatherman. I take that coke leaf and make that snow. Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door. O after O, you know, homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin. Niggaz be schemin, I'm fiendin to live a good life. The fiends just fiendin. Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see. The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me. [Chorus]. I want the finer things in my life. So I hustle (hustle). Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin to get mine. And I'll buck you (buck you). I don't care who you run with, or where you from. Nigga fuck you (fuck you). I want to find the thing thats in my life. So I hustle (hustle). [Verse 2]. Yea, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks. Black talents start flyin, when a nigga flip. I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me. Man my cold days, they called me chef boy are 50. Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit. Send me them seeds i'll grow 'em what they need. Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic. And I'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it. I sold everythin I'ma hustler, I know how to grind. Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine. If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA recrock. What goes in my mind, its contagious. Hypnotic, it sounds melodic. If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be poke and butter. Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key. And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. Its a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision. Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin. It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes. In the jewels with your chains. I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS. Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot. I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline. Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin. I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state. Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate. Them holi tip bent me up, but I'm back in shape. Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake. I'm like the East coast number one playboy B. Hugh Hefner'll tell you he don't got shit on me. The feds watch me, icey they can't stop me. Racist, pointin at me look at the nigga ratchi. Hello!. [Chorus]. *Enviado por ""Sekef"""

To make you clip for shawty I'm that nigga in New York. Shawty now lay down, put your head back. I put your legs back stroke and move your bed back. When we get to those back shots, shawty throw it back. When you back it up at me I like that. Let me guess I turn you on, I turn you on I bet. We just getting started and everything soaking wet. This pússy good she ain't worry about the rent this month. This pússy must have went and bought this b¡tch that. Benz out front. For me is nothing I'm just fùcking for the fùck of it. But shawty acting like we just did some other shit. It can't be it could be okay maybe she's a good girl. Attracted to me and thanks for my work. Temptations are great, when tennis bracelets. That were eight carats are 10 times 8. {Chorus}. I could take you to dinner girl but I ain't gonna lie. I just wanna fúck you baby. Go to the movie girl but I ain't gonna lie. I just wanna fúck you girl. Said I could take you shopping girl, I ain't gonna lie. I just wanna fùck you baby. Oh I could feel your hair up girl but I ain't gonna lie. I just wanna fúck you girl"
i am what i am,"[chorus- 50 Cent]. I-love-you, she loves all this man. This is our G-Unit game, this is something - for a real pimp'. I-love-you, she loves all that cake. I put everything to shake, look at my face - a real pimp'. [verse1- 50 Cent]. Yea, it would be like winning the lottery. It would be like you win mentally. I love you, I'm a little of New York hate. The anger that flows in our face. But today I am here to talk about love. When you're underneath I'll put it above. New 'Curtis' City remains the same. Games and gambling, crimes, G-Unit and fame. Soldiers in the morning doing a love rap. Swinging the arms in a Maybach. We will make every minute claim like that. Night that the stars tipped bright in my ear. Don't be fear, I repeat not be fear. F-50 when with Yay', not on anything. You can scream, oh-hey 50 Cent!. [chorus- 50 Cent]. I-love-you, she loves all this man. This is our G-Unit game, this is something - for a real pimp'. I-love-you, she loves all that cake. I put everything to shake, look at my face - a real pimp'. [verse2- Tony Yayo]. Yea fifty, if it's to talk about love. We can't leave the G-Unit out. Up, down, I speak in distress. This story of crying for you ought to clean dishes. The next acquisition is my wishes. No nigger singing rap. It's not as if there was no star in the sky. Flying in my private jet, knowing the sky. If the ask why, I say when I buy. The things I see in shop windows. In my power, when there is still time. I don't do the blind, my jewelry is the shine. Look, the curves of cars, and the design. I'm the boss of this show stripper. Don't mess with a nigger. You can see who are the bigger. Yea!. [chorus- 50 Cent]. I-love-you, she loves all this man. This is our G-Unit game, this is something - for a real pimp'. I-love-you, she loves all that cake. I put everything to shake, look at my face - a real pimp'. [verse3- 50 Cent]. Yay' I think we realized. It's not easy. Life is not lottery. The life that I did was not by casualties. Faced many wars. But I never knew the failure, I'm just a rap' star. Winning more than a star of the NBA. Winning more than a star in LA. This song will be the top Yay '. Oh-hey, do what has to do. Don't let him call a dumb-hot. You that I can speak beautiful things and hot. I submit that man, I make it 3 holes. I show him my Bentley and my Rolls. Haha. [chorus- 50 Cent]. I-love-you, she loves all this man.

I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you. I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you. But you think I know cause you know how my squad do. [Verse 1: 50 Cent]. Nowadays niggaz snitchin so much in the street. That you gotta talk to them like they the police. Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat. I don't know nothin 'bout sellin no beef in the street. Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams. I ain't never had no spot. or went hand to hand. Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand. I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can. Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash. Coke, dope, ex, dust or crystal meth. Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get me some cash. Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass. [Chorus: Prodigy]. Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you. I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you. I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you. But you think I know cause you know how my squad do. [Verse 2: Prodigy]. Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles. I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible. All I know who spittin all I know who givin. Me all this cash, just to put down twelve fo' gettin yo' ass. Listen, keep it far away from me. I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentuary. All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work. When the album drop they go bezerk. Mad video play, crazy radio spins. Number one all the time, our reign never ends. Don't point the finger at us somebody's shit hangin. They had a beef with us,. plus we don't know nathin. [Chorus: Spider Loc. Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you. I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you. I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you. But you think I know cause you know how my squad do. [Verse 3: Spider Loc]. I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head. But for real that's fucked up. they say that homeboy dead. I can't even think, who would want him dead. Have no idea what type of gun they done him with. You see I hear no evil and I see no evil. Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people. And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal. I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal. I don't know why my name in your female phone. But you really startin to sound like a females homes. Don't know why they told you that we sell stones. We on the internet tryin to get our Email on. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you. I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you. I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you. But you think I know cause you know how my squad do. [Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]. Nah nigga I don't know who sent. them young boys through. To air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue. I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news. I don't know why that man clutchin on that shit. when you move. I don't know why that other rapper. got stripped for his jewels. You know how easy it is to get shit confused. I wasn't even in New York, I was just on the cruise. Somewhere way out in the islands. with your bitch in the cruise. Oops, my bitch in the cruise,. dudes get hit when they snooze. Lose they hit from the Uz, ooze all over the street. I don't know why they said what's up. I don't know who's in that jeep. He talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep. [Chorus: Mase]. Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you. I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you. I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you. But you think I know cause you know how my squad do. [Verse 5: Mase]. I don't know why my charm. 'bout as big as your palm. And why the diamond chain I wear. as 'bout as long as your arm. You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel. There's one for every time I had to grind up in the ghetto. I could show you how to do it,. you tired of ridin Buicks. I don't know why niggaz rap for years. and can't make hotter music. Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid. Body drop, shotty pop, and niggaz wanna tie me to it. I don't know why Loon and Fabby. won't just say I'm they daddy. Why these Harlem Cb4 niggaz. just keep comin at me. Got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church. Could you imagine if my hands was on work,. I don't know.... [Chorus: 50 Cent]. Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you. I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you. I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you. But you think I know cause you know how my squad do"
i don't need 'em,"[Intro]. Yeah. It is what it is man. Uh huh. [Verse 1]. Sirens flashin', you know the routine, the crime scene taped off. It started off a robbery, they blew half his face off. They seen him shinin', course full of diamonds he bought. Grindin', his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin'. The D's came through, asked the niggas if they knew what happened. Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin'. Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me. They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me. When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe. I turn a quarter to a half, thats why they mess with me. I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks. A little weed, a little X, a little H, a little crack. Figure, I push it to the limit, take this shit to the max. Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat. Calm, in my palm, fully loaded fire arm. First to let off, last to run, everytime its on. [Chorus]. I tell niggas to suck my dick. Get the fuck out my face. Cause I don't need 'em. Cause they're never around. When I'm down. Shot and I'm bleedin'. [50 Cent]. What, niggas yeah. Is there a mothafuckin' problem nigga. Oh yeah. That's what I thought so, pussy. [Verse 2]. niggas be talkin' about me, they always callin' me crazy. Fuck them O.G. niggas, they stuck in the eighties. Sayin' they gonna do me somethin', now you know thats a lie. nigga you look at me wrong, I'll let that hammer fly. I'm rich, I still wake up with crime on my mind. Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime. When I say move, nigga move or get caught in the cross fire. Up a fence runnin, cut my fuckin' hand on a barb wire. Shits crazy, just a different day, its the same shit. Hollow tip part in ya head, leave ya whole fuckin' brain split. They sit, they see me in the Ashton Martin. What's the matter, they can't get that Hoopty started. Thought they was grindin', well goddamn where that money at. Thought you was fucked, cause you was lettin' paper stack. You ain't a hustler, matter of fact, you's a busta. I don't trust ya, I shoulda sent niggas to touch ya. [Chorus]. I tell niggas to suck my dick. Get the fuck out my face. Cause I don't need 'em. Cause they're never around. When I'm down. Shot and I'm bleedin'. [Outro]. What?. Who said they gonna do somethin' to me. You must be out your rabbid ass mind. Fuck around and kill one of these niggas. . enviado por : teeago@hotmail.com"

i run new york (feat. tony yayo),"[chorus - 50 Cent]. The walls have ears lil' nigga, I run New York,. Even when I ain't there lil' nigga, I run New York,. I said the walls have ears lil' nigga, I hear when you talk,. Let's get this shit clear lil' nigga, I run New York. [verse 1 - 50 Cent]. I wake up, stare at the ceilin',. I'm alive, what a beautiful feelin',. I put my vest on right after I put on my drawers,. It's a habit I'm always prepared for war,. See my life's like some shit, you seen in a flick,. Bitches act like pornstars when they sit on a dick,. When I was hit and out the game I said ""one more flick"",. Test my aim in the range I'm like ""one more clip"",. It's my brain, I'm insane, I be on some shit,. Man I run Interscope, Jada's tryna annoy me,. Nuthin' but another disgruntled employee,. He been in the game ten years and he still ain't rich,. Even his mama upset that he still ain't shit,. And he keep runnin his yap, like I'ma take all that,. One more word out his mouth I'll push Style's shit back,. See the nozzle on my tre pound is three inches long,. And the trigger on the fo' fo's extremly strong,. With a little tre douche is like pop, pop,. Chase his ass up the block til his bitch ass drop,. And the verses he be kickin' none of 'em hot,. Cos he ain't got none of that shit he says he got,. And he ain't did none of that shit he said he did,. And I ain't got time to be talkin 'bout this shit, (fuckin' faggot). [chorus - 50 Cent]. I guess it's easy to see lil' nigga, I run New York,. Yeah I live in CC lil' nigga, but I run New York,. And I don't go to parties lil' nigga, but I run New York,. And I stay gettin Cs lil' nigga, cos I run New York. (Yayo, tell 'em I run New York). [verse 2 - Tony Yayo]. My gun is longer than yours, nigga, call your recouster,. Locks made more money than them thin tiny suits,. The game around south, drugs and rappin,. Jada fuckin punchlines, my serp went platinum,. Style's and C Loot's went double plastic,. Yayo, Buck and Banks was puttin out classics,. A hundred shots, a hundred clips, y'all ready to die,. Fat Joe ain't a gangsta, he afraid to fly,. Automatic mossberg, who want a piece of this punk,. I had Ja Rule buryed and some high heel punk,. Feds stuck in a bullet-proof, man fuck that,. Homie, shoot up my whip, you only leave a scratch,. Yo, I slip cocaine, in your hotel lobby,. And beat you wit my pistol like Kane did Charlie,. It's T.O.N.Y.Y.A.Y.O.,. My whole clique, gotto,my Os on the fly hole,. C4s, we fly on linz,. And my rocks lookin like, Flex likes yo' benz,. [chorus - 50 Cent]. When I'm down in DC lil' nigga, I tell 'em, I run New York,. When I'm out in Philly lil' homie, I run New York,.

And you know I love the way you make the bed rock. Take me to extasy without taking Extasy. [Verse 2:]. When I first met her. I did anything to get her (what?). Paid all her bills and filled the 'fridgerator (uh huh). Reminiscin' on late nights when I try to lay up. but couldn't get off cause your baby would stay up. She even crashed the whip tryin' to switch in the third lane. That's when I realized this bitch was a bird brain. A pigeon writin' her baby pops in the box in the prison. Sing-sing is where he biddin'. She in the Gucci tights and Findi high heals. Baby wipes and cans of Infamil. Moter bike and grams of fish scale. It's a 9 to 5 niggas with no frills. Turnin' young niggas with princables to old men with debts. And all the prank calls was death threats that bitch had the. best sex. All across the globe and the bitch head game was out of control. [Chorus]. Girl you know I like it when you climb on top. Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock. And you know I love the way you make the bed rock. Take me to extasy without taking Extasy. Girl you know I like it when you climb on top. Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock. And you know I love the way you make the bed rock. Take me to extasy without taking Extasy. [Verse 3]. I'm wonderin' when I'm gone if you'll miss me (miss me). or do you miss the Don Perion and the Cristy. I'm fuckin' with you. I'm feelin' your shape I'm feelin' your eyes.

The Lords blessin' makes me wiser as the world's turnin'. My tongue touch the right spot have your toes curlin'. Whether we're just kickin' it or sexin' (uh huh) I'm a pro baby. girl I spit. game to perfection (Yeah). So when niggas make mistakes I correct them and. When niggas get out of line I check them man.

Girl you know I like it when you climb on top. Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock. And you know I love the way you make the bed rock. Take me to extasy without taking Extasy. Yeah.

i'm a hustler,"Rule number one don't go against the grain. Rule number two give respect where respect due. Rule number three if you get knocked play games and say names. (gun click sound) the 45 will tear you out the frame. Its like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fuckin thing. Don't mean nothin changed but the things my money bring. My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail. You peoples got pleany money actin like they ain't got bail. I feel for you niggas gettin shot while I'm sayin this rhyme. Or niggas in the mess hall gettin shot on shallow lines. An old timer schooled me don't burn bridges my friend. Imagine the G-Dub close and yo ass gotta swim. I watch the fifth melt a nigga melt a nigga of the sidewalk of. New York. Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk. He said I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my. word. Look at his head its still shakin he had alot of nerve. (chorus). (Jadakiss sample: If it wasn't for the flow. I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack). (Jay-Z sample: yea yea I'm a hustler). 3x. (chorus). Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited. Hardcore niggas start actin feminine. With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time. Duke you get ten you'll damn near do nine. Hate a liar more than I hate thief. A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality. The streets I know'em like my ABC's. Stay away from the D's and stack ya cheese. Try to see three hundred g's fore you see three hundred C's. Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for key's. Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy. Once I nut (ahh oh shit) I don't want 'em next to me. If its on mother fucker believe I'm gonna ride. I'm the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride. Letters on my shirt read DKNY. Got grimy niggas runnin with me from BKNY. (Chorus). They say I don't sound like a killer well how a killer sound. I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down. See many men live baby and many men die. Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high. Here's a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends. Your enemies remain the same friends always change. I don't quit that theres more that one way to skin a cat. You can get him in the face dog or down his back. All bullshit aside now its time to be honest. I fear no man for death is all thats promised. I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit. From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit. This for you niggas in the background dyin to shine. I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine. Don't nothin change in the game but faces and names. Skate to wait to date and the jake. (chorus)"

The hood raised us wrong. What it takes to get your money (?). But look I'm gone. Would that touch your heart have you feelin funny inside. Would that be enough to make your punk ass ride. What if he gave you a lil list of things to do. Said he wouldn't have to die. He could live through you. Would you load your gats and get ready ro ride. Or would you lock the door at your crib and hide. It's a cold world even when it's hot outside. Wether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain. Hid him cause he was your strength. Now you in a dave.

I take the pain from my life, pour it all inside. Take my strain and my strife, take my ego and pride. Used it to kick down the door, brought my people inside. And I hope you, ain't think I wrote this. To entertain you, that ain't what I came to do. I will bang you, I will act like orangutan's do. I give you hot wings, turn niggaz to angels. Understand my angle, I'm safety first. Don't make me act, like the safety don't work. Tough niggaz get it the worst, I'm beggin you come for us. I'm giving motherfuckers, dirt com-forters. [Chorus].

many men (wish death),"[Lloyd Banks]. Man we gotta go get something to eat man. I'm hungry as a motherfucker. [50 Cent]. Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son?.

Blood in my eye dawg and I can't see. I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be. And niggaz trying to take my life away. I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me. My back on the wall, now you gon' see. Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me. Cause I'll come and take your life away. Many men, many, many, many, many men. Wish death upon me. Lord I don't cry no more. Don't look to the sky no more. Have mercy on me. [Verse One]. Now these pussy niggaz putting money on my head. Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead. I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found. I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned. When I rhyme, something special happen every time. I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime. I walk the block with the bundles. I've been knocked on the humble. Swing the ox when I rumble. Show your ass what my gun do. Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head. Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs. I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder. Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over. [Chorus - singing]. Many men, many, many, many, many men. Wish death upon me. Lord I don't cry no more. Don't look to the sky no more. Have mercy on me. Have mercy on my soul. Somewhere my heart turned cold. Have mercy on many men. Many, many, many, many men. Wish death upon me. [Verse Two]. Sunny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain. Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain. Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard. It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred. This if for my niggaz on the block, twisting trees and cigars. For the niggaz on lock, doing life behind bars. I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear. Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years. I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don. Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm. Slim switched sides on me, let niggaz ride on me. I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back. I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat. In my nightmares, niggaz keep pulling techs on me. Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me. The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot. I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked. I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time. Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines. In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around. Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down. Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason. 'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing. [Chorus]"

I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints. Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not. long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop. it goes on and on and on and it don't stop.. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. One thing you can always count on is change. and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game. had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range. would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change. now it's hard to find us or stay behind us. while we on the 900 double R Hondas. watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips. while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs. all these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World. you can find a material Girl. I sip Dom 'till I earl. take 'em two at a time. quick I get in they mind. have 'em thinkin' they mine. bust off then tell 'em ""Bust a Uey, on mo' time"".

Niggas be fronting, word up it's stunting til they heard up. Their semi talk, I let that buck, I had these niggas running hard. I pull a nigga skirt up, and have him kicking dirt up. I get a nigga hit a nigga, back up stupid hard. Silence, it's the return of the tyrants. Symptom ? we're botch closed islands. Stand close to the homie you wanna die with. Flames come up bout the?the shit that I do. I'm talking like the feds ain't listening. Nigga this a pool of piranhas you pissing it. I get it nigga if you want it. Better ask niggas out me I be on it. I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect planning. Hit your back with something hot, out the can. It's murder one, and I'm at a ?, matter. Then it's another one, back to back we're working. It's murder one, and I'm at a ?, matter. Then it's another one, back to back we're working. You know I got the strap on me, bar holding that for me. I'm fucked up, it really doesn't matter though. 100 9 millimeter shells in the telico. Wait, niggas drop like domino. Run for your life puta, see, vamo nos. I was taught to see my ? long time ago. Walk around with cocaine, yeah even my mama know. I cut a o in the ?made 4 hundred off deck. You know a nigga grind. Like Cindi Lauper bitch, time after time. A nigga shine, like a nickel 9.

my buddy,"[Chorus - 50 Cent]. My buddy, my buddy. Wherever I go, he go. My buddy, my buddy. You can run for your life, I'ma stick him out the window. My buddy, my buddy. I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple. Stay in your place I recommend. Or say hello to my little friend. [Lloyd Banks]. Everywhere I go, I gotta tag along. Cause my bud's getting strong and they mad him on. He ride with me when I pass the mall. And wait for me on the bench when I run to get my basketball. One sneeze'll make a bastard fall, gasp and crawl. You need a bulletproof vest, mask and all. Bring your buddy when it's time to roam (Why?). Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home. My hand bling full of platinum to shine his chrome. He even got closet space inside my home. He ain't never been broke, he glitchless. I'm so reliable, I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas. Infrared beam and a scope for distance. The best company when approacing business. He will ride with me 'til the end. We all got a friend and mine is a G-U-N. [Chorus]. [50 Cent]. My buddy got a temper, he dying to pop off. Last time he did the cops had the block all locked off. Take him with me to hustle, stashed him in a trashcan. My fingertips off before hours I bag grams. You meet him, your destination's hell or heaven. Cause I only bring him out for that 187. He don't have a heart, I just keep feeding him shells. He get it popping in the hood, so his name rings bells. Ms. Jones stay on the 3rd floor, she called the cops on me. They came, I ran, I had to toss my other little homey. Niggas know I got new friends so they stay in their place, kid. I stay screaming on niggas and beating up baseheads. These niggas ain't thorough, they just like to pretend. Keep fucking 'round they gon' say hello to my little friend. [Gunshots]. [Chorus]. [Young Buck]. We been though it all but yet we both still living. We been in a box but we both still spitting. And when there was beef, you even played your position. Got under the seat until we spotted our victim. At first they wouldn't listen 'til they heard you go off. Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York. And little did they know that we was ready for way. Bet the nigga wish he never stuck his head out the door. See whenever you come out, something happen on the block. You the reason that nigga done stopped rapping like Pac. People see you and run, and you ain't even say shit. They just know you ain't nothing to play with. You stay with sixteen homeys, and one in the hole. When the first one get out, the next one go. To know where you headed, you got to know where you been. The glock stay with me, we friends 'til the end. [Chorus]. [Outro - ""Scarface"" clip, gunshots]"

my life (feat. eminem & adam levine),"(Adam Levine). My life, my life. Makes me wanna run away. There's no place to go. No place to go. All the confusion. It's an illusion like a movie. Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try. (50 Cent). Yeah, 03, I went from back filthy to filthy rich. Man, the emotions change. So I can never trust a bitch. I tried to help niggas get on,. They turned around and spit. Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick. Now when you hear 'em. It may sound like it's some other shit. Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits. I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned. If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned. I'm doing what I'm supposed to,. I'm a writer, I'm a fighter. Entrepeneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me manoeuver. What's it to ya?. The track I lace it, it's better than basic. This is my recovery, my comeback, kid. (Adam Levine). My life, my life. Makes me wanna run away. There's no place to go. No place to go. All the confusion. It's an illusion like a movie. Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try. (Eminem). While you were sipping your own kool-aid. Getting your buzz heavy. I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete. Sipping some of of that revenge juice,. Getting my taste buds ready. To whoop down this spaghetti,. Or should I say this spaghett-even?. I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting. Thought he was finished, motherfucker,. it's only the beginning. He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin',. Fuck who he's offending. He'll rip your vocal chords out. And have them bitches plugged in me. Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity. Now take the other end, dump them. Then pluck them motherfuckers. In each one of your eyesockets cause I thought. You might finally fucking see. That'll teach you to go voicing. Your cocksuckin' opinion to me. I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit. Fuck letting up,. You're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me. Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah,. It's happening again. I'm thinking about the same. Mother fuck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50!. Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go. I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this. More than anybody knows. I'm trapped, so all I do is rap,. But everytime I rap I'm more trapped. And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh oh,. I guess it's bubble wrap. This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis. Christ, how was I supposed to know. Shit would turn up like it did?. Feels like I'm going psycho again. And I might just blow my lid. Shit,. I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid. Cause I'm running in circles with. (Adam Levine). My life, my life. Makes me wanna run away. There's no place to go. No place to go. All the confusion. It's an illusion like a movie. Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try. (50 Cent). I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid. Sold like 40 million records,. People forgot what I did. Maybe this is for me, maybe. Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy. Maybe I'll do it 3 AM in the morning like Shady. Psycho killer, Michael Myers,. I'm on fire like a lighter. Tryna say the same classic,. Get your ass kicked. Man crook, wrap your head up in plastic. Pussy, now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots. It's tragic, it's sad it's. Never gonna end, now we number one again. With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate. Accept it, respect it. This a gift God gave me like the air in the lungs. And every fucking thing with it. (Adam Levine). My life, my life. Makes me wanna run away. There's no place to go. No place to go. All the confusion. It's an illusion like a movie. Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try"

Niggas find what club they at. take 'em wit us, and run a train on 'em like a subway mac. get advances from grey agra. see these record labels got most artists gettin fucked like the gay rappa'. i go the college on the tour.

Camera's by the hamper that mine into the floor. by now, you probably heard of me. fresh outta surgery, flashy as a fuck, you gon' have to murder me. Burglary, I'm leavin wit cha nike's bergendy, White T, bergendy. you match now, back down. niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear. catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and official gear. heavy when I toke, C notes from different years.

I lay you down, them coroner will come and get ya up. See 50 play fa keeps, and 50 stay wit heat. I can't go commercial, they love me in the street. I'm real dirty man, the hood love me man. Don't make me show up in ya crib like bro-man. Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing. C-O screaming shut the fuck up in the pen. [Chorus] x2. I'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday. Range on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay. Porsche on Friday, I do things my way. Viper or Vette, I tear up the highway. Shorty she can tell ya about my dick game. But she don't know me, she only know my nickname. Left the hood and came back, damn shit changed. These young boys, they done got they own work man. [Chorus] x2. ."

Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin them thangs. [Verso um: 50 Cent]. After the VMA's my baby momma cussed my ass out. I kicked her ass, we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stoute. Cut the grass around my crib so I could see these snakes. You see 'em back in the hood, it's cause I see they're fake. A preacher's son about the paper like I'm Creflo Dollar. I pop you punk niggaz like I pop my collar. I'm confused, I like Megan, Monica and Mya. Missy's freaky and Brandy's shot up. Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up. I'm on now, God damnit, I done came up (what?). Now you can find me with the finest hoes. Choosin which whip to drive by what match my clothes. I got a fetish for the stones, I'm heavy on the ice man. If I ain't got a pistol on me, sure I got a knife fam. Get out of line and I'm lightin yo' ass up. Semi-automatic's the way I tighten yo' ass up - what?. [Refrão]. [Verso dois: Lloyd Banks]. Slow down punk nigga, don't exceed your speed. Cause I will put G's on your fitted like the Negro League.

(YEA!) In a minute I'ma have the jeweler makin my rims spin. My crew run wild like the Jamaicans in Kingston. Nuttin but bling bling in your face boy; that's why my neck shine. like one of the shirts that Puffy and Mase wore (AHH). I done found a nympho as soon as I pop a broad. She had my balls, head first like a soccer star. You can only stand next to the man if you proper. That take care of birds like an animal doctor. I been out and buzzin, niggaz just slept on me. So I'm out for revenge like one of Bin Laden cousins. [Refrão]. [Verso tres: Young Buck]. Read the paper, look at the news, we on the front page. Yeah we in the Bahamas with AK's on the stage. The ice in the Jacob watch'll make a broke nigga take somethin. So I gotta keep the fo'-fifth with no safety button. G-Unit get that money, I know some artists is starvin. but play the game like they rich, to me the shit funny. I know you see me comin; cause on the front of the Maybach. it say PAYBACK for those that hated on me. I hate when niggaz claim they bangin or gang. You ain't a Crip like Snoop, you ain't no Blood like Game. See I been havin beef, I got my own bulletproof vest. Most of my enemies dead, I got about two left. Until my last breath, I'm sendin niggaz bulletholes. Innocent bystanders get hit tryin to be heroes. You know how we roll, everywhere that we go. It's fo-fo's, calicos, and desert eagles. [Refrão]"
porn star,"50 Cent ft. Lloyd Banks - Porn Star. (50 Cent -- talking). I dont even know how to explain it, you know?. You know, from time to time she`s on my mind you know. I mean She`s my kinda girl. You know every now and then you might find somebody you feel. like understands you a lil bit, you know?. It`s all good man. (Chorus). She`s something like a porno star.

Never seen her on tape before. But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al. (Lloyd Banks). Around the Carolina hood see, most niggas called her ho and diss. her. Cuz she`s slowly growing up to be like her older sister. She got a bad reputation so you don`t hold and kiss her. And after one conversation you`d probly fold in twister. It ain`t hard to tell that honey`s dumb. She`s 18 goin on 21. Mama don`t know where she get her money from. Hoppin in the naughty cars. Stuffed in the backseat. Lookin to score big. Cuz she fucks all the athletes. Somethin like a princess gon wrong. Used to be a ballerina. Now she performs to ""The Thong Song"". Happily had plans to enroll in college. Now you`d rather slide down metal poles for dollas. Your fingernails and your toes is polished. But your brain`s on freeze. In other words frozen knowledge. All your plans and your goals - demolished. You grew up in Southside. Why niggas know you a ho in ?Hollis? huh?. (Chorus). Something like a porno star. She`s something like a super freak. I never seen her on tape before. But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al. My kinda girl. Porno star. She`s something like a super freak. Never seen her on tape before. But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al. My kinda girl. (Lloyd Banks). I still remember how it all started. School - cuttin from class. Every boy you knew touching yo` ass. Headed no where fast. I ain`t gon` lie. Shorty I used to laugh. Cuz you was the main topic on ???. I seen her in the mall shoppin. I`m contemplating bout stoppin. Cuz she could get me off like Cochran. Now that dinner was poppin. Spoiled, her daddy was pumpin. He probly thought she`d grow up to get married or somethin. But little did he know. His little princess was a city ho. Pretty, ooh the face. Tight from the video. Damn, this bitch is thick. She on the Lil Kim shit. See her hair match the color of her lipstick. Now this chick claimed to love jewelry like Slick Rick. And had a walk on her that would leave you with a stiff dick. Jeans had a sick fit. To make a long story short. This ain`t the type a bitch you wanna stick with. (Chorus). Porno Star. She`s somethin like a super freak. I never seen her on tape before. But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al. My kinda girl. Porno star. She`s somethin like a super freak. I never seen her on tape before. But when she go low she`s a pro-fes-sion-al. My kinda girl"

Hit the three on his niggas grass, the cattle said it got low. fast. The kid who had it done was a crude fella. Who woulda thought he wile out over that mozzarella.

Get ya ass beat up, stabbed, and shot up. Niggas will tear your fucking block up. Over some prada. (Chorus)"

rotten apple,"(50 Cent). I'm on parole, I used to be on probaaaaaation. I'm with my gun I get full coporaaaaaation. I tell you ""take it off"" no hesitaaaaaation. Nigga you play around, I lay you down. That's how it's goin' down. Don't play wit' me, I don't have patieeeeeents. My headachin', and I need my medicaaaaaaation. Niggaz be hatin', they don't know what they faaaaaacin'. Nigga you play around, I lay you down. That's how it's goin' down. I be in court throwin' signs like I'm a maaaaaason. Nigga witness against me, I'ma eraaaaaase 'em. If they try an runaway, I'ma chaaaaaaase 'em. Now with the pound, and I'm a lay 'em down. That's how it's goin' down. [Chorus]. Better watch how you talk. Better watch where you walk. On the streets of New York. That's how we get down. 22's on the jeep. Somthin' deep in the seat. When we creep wit the heat. That's how we get down. (50 Cent). Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk. Stick up kids don't live long in New York. Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street. Get caught slippin', then get hit wit' like three. In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feelin'. Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villan. I play the bar with 8 bottles all night gettin' right. Teachin' the hoodrats what Cristal taste like. I put 60 on wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck. We in the hood nigga schemin', what you expect?. My S on 22's leave ya hos confuuuuuused. On the track ready to choose, like ""Daddy we want you"". My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me. Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me. Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk. I came to teach you how we put it down in New York. That's how we get down. [Chorus]. Better watch how you talk. Better watch where you walk. On the streets of New York. That's how we get down. 22's on the jeep. Somthin' deep in the seat. When we creep wit the heat. That's how we get down. (50 Cent). In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit. O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get yo' ass hit. I don't know why niggaz like to talk bad about me. I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D.. Man it could be the money, it could be the ice. It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life. You should here they be sayin' man ""50 be flippin'"". ""Shot my man over 7 grams, that nigga be trippin'"". I know death is promised, I don't fear gettin' murked. It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts. Now we can hit the club and get it crunked. Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with. the pump, you can have it how you want. But I know you like my style (Uh-Huh). Ya like how I break it down, wanna get rich?. I'll show you how, take this pack, pump these pieces. That's how we get down. [Chorus]. Better watch how you talk. Better watch where you walk. On the streets of New York. That's how we get down. 22's on the jeep. Somthin' deep in the seat. When we creep wit the heat. That's how we get down."

Shook nigga (shook nigga, shook nigga). I'm a Guiness Book nigga. [Chorus 2x]. We don't play that pussy shit round here. You can get your fuckin wig split down here. Don't rep where you come from too much around here. You can get your fuckin cap filt. [Verse 2]. If I can't get my gun in the club, why whould I come in the club. So them niggas I done stuck up could cut me he fuck up, nah. I'm outside to jump off in a benz jeep. 4 deep strapped with all kinds of heat. Niggas think they want beef. They don't want beef.

An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it's like a stickup kid. runnin round without no heat, it like a fifth with no kick. a fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit.

Now if I pull out the gat and just push your wig back. I bet niggaz will stand around sayin ""Damn who did. that?"". I'm the type nigga to dare you to touch the ?. I'm the type to borrow your gat and wont give the shit back. Im F to the I - F -T - Y - C - E - N - T. Caress the ass gently, and back up Bentleys. You thought she was pimpin, son I was in the Hamptons. in a heart shaped hot tub with the bitch flappin. I plan to take over New York and start expandin. Was Bob Marley singin about tex when he sung ""I'm. Jammin'"". Nigga fuck with my cash and I'ma blast yo' ass. Smash the glock out the stash in the dash in ??. Flee in a flash, lay low let time go past. If you survive the shots I'ma find yo' ass. Put the gat to your head and remind your ass. I ain't playin with you, I want my money motherfucker. Chorus.

I run with niggaz that spray and strip and say that shit. You won't let us pump on your block, fuck it, we makin it hot. I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch. From the cordless cell phone, and the baby blue drop. I got a lot of hungry niggaz with me straight from the street. Cause these three niggaz are startin to look like something to. eat.

ryder music,"[Intro]. Yeah. Yeah we can ride to this. Just lay back, crew. [Verse 1]. Here's a taste of my life, its bitter and sweet. I put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat. I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street. Put my teflon on and roll with my heat. I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown. *****s. In a race for the cheese, I run laps around *****s. Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds. Soon as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok start sore. I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, *****s can tell. The east coast crib, the size of a small hotel. The shit journalist write about me, get me confused. Have me feelin' like the heavy weight champ when he lose. I read somewhere, I'm homophobic shiiit. Go through the hood, there's mad *****s on my dick. Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth. T&T around, I can still make blow move. [Chorus x2]. This is what you call ryder music. All the gangstas are ridin' to it. Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it. When we ride to that ryder music (let's go). [Let's go]. [Verse 2]. Last year, I woke up, a good look, damn it feels good. On the low, I done fucked half of Hollywood. Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows. In my favorite position, you know how it goes. In my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit ""This is When Thugs Cry"". This is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly. Homie, this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to. Stay on point, cause *****s will ride and smoke you. Jealousy's for women, but some *****s is bitch made. They make you wanna run across they're head with a switch blade. They point their finger at me, sayin' I'm bug. My flows crack you listen, your fuckin' brains on drugs. Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on the tec. Fool trippin' through the set, you can get ya ass whipped. Cards missin' out my deck, screws loose show respect. You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct. [Chorus x2]. This is what you call ryder music. All the gangstas are ridin' to it. Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it. When we ride to that ryder music (let's go). [Let's go]. [Verse 3]. My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win. Pray to Lord, forgive me for my sins. Still thuggin', cruisin', rims gleamin'. Like the stones on my wrist. Zonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich. Homie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch. Stupid, chase the paper, they come with the shit. I'm fallin', in love with success. Entrepeneure, kinda sewer, I maneuver the best. Rowin', ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle. Stunt I'll have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle. As wise men speak, I listen and learn. A man dies, a baby's born, my *****s the world turns. Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit. They mistake my confidance for arrogance, they hate on the kid. In '99, I had a vision and made a decision. Bein' broke is against my religion, now picked up. [Chorus x2]. This is what you call ryder music. All the gangstas are ridin' to it. Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it. When we ride to that ryder music (let's go). [Let's go]"
salute u,"[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]. General I salute you. I put a hole in any nigga tryin' to shoot you. It ain't nothin' cause loyalty's what I'm used to. And what I don't do I'll have one of my troops do. Nigga we'll kill you. [Verse 1: Young Buck]. I'm ready for combat, a soldier on the front lines. Take it to the streets nigga mothafucker punch line. It only take one time for you to send a death threat. And watch these bullets have that ass singin' like. Keith Sweat. You ain't met me yet, I been camouflaged in the bushes. And I'm co-signin 50 cause them niggas all pussy. Bustin' shots at ya convoy, you don't want war. No surrender, no retreat, this is Vietnam boy. Check my war wounds, I done took a couple for the team. Only niggas that been on the battlefield know what I. mean. Take cover, we comin' pullin' pins out of grenades. You won't make it to the General without gettin'. sprayed. Might as well say hello to my brand new little friend. Only time he come out to put holes in grown men. You can send your troops and get 'em all blown back. Walk up on 'em wit a deuce deuce, and nigga hold that. [Chorus: x2]. [Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]. Look nigga, I suggest you go home. Cause I won't hesitate to let the chrome touch ya. Nigga I'm never scared like Bone Crusher. Stand alone, provide my own supper. Tell ya baby momma stop comin' around here or I'm gon'. fuck her. We'll try to take up for them lames around you. He'll get shots for free like I flagrant fouled you. I'm on the road blowin' grade A haze and brown. Got niggas runnin' like the KKK's around. My album's comin', a new year's approachin'. My buzz gettin' bigger, a few ears is open. Can your team play in the game, without you here to. coach 'em. There's a very fine line between a boo and a ocean. Sometimes I'm in Atlanta where the big head bounce. And you could come, but after you give Banks head. bounce. These niggas really want war, cause if so put on your. vest. Cause all you gotta do is just say yes. [Chorus: x2]. [50 Cent Talking]. G-Unit's like the Firm. Cause you can get in, you can't get out. [Tony Yayo Talking]. This is G-Unit life right here, know what I'm sayin'. We used to sell drugs, you know bust guns and all the. other. Now we're laid back, now we doin' us, we live it up. 50 got us right, got us kicked up right now"

Niggas in the hood can't see G-UNIT!. but deep in they heart they wanna be G-UNIT!. cause we got them three b's: benzes, burners and bitches. and plus we on the road to the riches. [Chorus: repeat 2X]. You can say what you want about me. As long as you don't get in the way of my money. Cause all that talking shit to me played out. Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out. [Lloyd Banks]. Lately I been going through a phase. Hope they aint tap the phones. Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones. Therefore I'm on the move with the squad. I'm stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad. Picture me putting jewels on a broad. I'd rather put shoes on the car. A pool in the yard. You don't really wanna fool with the god. Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards. In this game, you only make it far if you loyal. And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled. Why swing, you gotta be strapped to get rid of me. Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty. Tryin to be cool. Blowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on. a school. Keep rappin for your hood, I'm rappin for benzes. And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses. [Chorus]. [50 Cent]. Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!). What I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G (Un-Huh). Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!). What I learned from watching Brucie B. Look, I shot the sheriff. And nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot. Here's the plan, I'm a keep stackin my ends. Till I'm on airplane seats in the Maebach benz. I'm all about the chips. I done took them trips. 22's on the 6. 26 on the bricks. And them outta town niggas, I'm chargin yall more. I tapdance on the shit I aint servin it raw. You sell smoke, look nigga I got what you need. But it aint goin cheap I got mouths to feed. Niggas always sayin damn 50 you bugged. Cause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug. Gimme his watch and his chain. We not the same, he a lame. He want pussy I'm bout my money man. Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick. Threw a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed. Yo its 50, when your mindframe change and start to rearrange. I'll see you another day motherfucker it's 50. Shots 'til your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker. [Chorus]"

Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat. As soon as I start dreaming I'm right back on the street. Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me. Gotta be, fucked up in the head and smoking hemee. Believe me if you thought like me you could be me. But you ain't been through what I been through and this shit ain't that easy (one). [Chorus]"
smile,"[50 Cent]. Yeah, this somethin special y'know, somethin epic. Lloyd Banks, you know. Cause a nigga thuggin don't mean he don't. Don't wanna see you smile baby. [Intro: 50 Cent]. Wooo! I wanna be the reason you smile. I wanna be the reason you smi-ile. I wanna be the reason you smile. After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes. [Verse One: Lloyd Banks]. I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge. From the conversations we have and the way it ends. You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends. That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz. It all depends, maybe if we make amends. We can start from scratch. Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact. We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact. So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back. You're amazing in the sack. Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black. God Bless whoever gave you alla that. If you seen her from the back. You'd understand why dis feel like that. And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows. Her pussy good enough to miss award shows. And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows. By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes. Up and down. [Chorus: Lloyd Banks + (50 Cent)]. Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin down. Let the thought of me be (I be the reason you smile). I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown. I wanna bring you joy and be (I be the reason you smile). Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down. I provide by any means to be (I be the reason you smile). We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while. I'm just happy I'm around to be (I be the reason you smile). [Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]. The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful. What about the half of this shit I done did to you. Violated and tip toed into a crib or two. I've come clean to be a bigger individual. Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you. Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggaz. when you tease 'em with your physical. She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left. Wild drama, section 8 princess. My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed. Cause it's hard to communicate. Cause she don't speak-a no english. I been around the world from state to state. But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom. Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on. Cause I'm leavin in a hour, fly-through, don't matter she's mad. Even when I holla back. All I really need your attention for a while. And, I bet you I can make you smile. [Chorus - 2X]"

Smile nigga my next album might be my last. Got what I came to get, the stacks and the stash. I told Jimmy Iovine ass to shut the fuck up. Got Dre callin' Shady sayin Em what's up?. We done came this far, we can't stop now. Em, 50 off the hook, he got to calm down. I guess I'm out of control, my mind, body and soul. Tell me I'm bein pimped and it's makin me sick. You know Em made that company over a billion dollars. And when he ain't around they sayin foul shit about him. Yeah we fucked up, we both don't know our pops. We both don't like the cops, we don't know when to stop. You know Kim is Shaniqua and Hailey is Marquise. D-12's G-Unit and we always in beef. Ja and Fred Durst, both of them jerks. Got put out the game, ha, ha, ya lames!. Paul's Chris Lighty, Tracy's Nicki Martin. Boxes of ox, sarge is a Glock. My nine is twenty four seven on watch. [Hook].

Smile nigga my next album might be my last,. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [Verse 2]. You know Oprah got In Da Club on her iPod. She don't want me on her show though I guess I'm too hard. She sat Kanye West down, and talked about his crash. But she don't wanna talk about the bullets in my ass. Spike Lee don't like it that my money come fast. I hate it when a nigga get to countin my cash. Now I can give the kids a positive message like Farrakhan. Or I can give 'em pistols and targets to squeeze 'em on. I'm tryin to make a decision damn, leave me alone. I'm like Martin Luther King people listen to me a lot. It's non violent, non violent till I'm hit with a rock. Then it's Coretta fuck this, go and get me my Glock. Wanna call me crazy? Okay it's cool. I'll have your kids tryin to be, crazy cool in school. Truth is they like me, more than they like you. They watch me and emulate, everything I do. [Hook]. Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah. Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah. Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah. Smile nigga my next album might be my last,. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [Verse 3]. I have days when I feel like everybody's against me. Sharpton ain't comin when the feds snatch 50. Just my luck Johnnie Cochran passed. Right before the crackers come snatch my ass. I'm the Don King of crack, the Pretty Floyd of rap. Put Southside on the map, I did that. Bill O'Reilly can't stand me but his woman think I'm cute. I bet she wanna see me in my birthday suit. Met Al Gore and his wife in them first class seats. She said she didn't like rap until she met me. You gotta understand I'm a charmin young man. A whole lot has changed since I went hand to hand. [Hook]. Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah. Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah. Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah. Smile nigga my next album might be my last,. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [Outro]. Should be happy, ya know? I just want you to be happy. Smile for me! If I gotta go away to make you feel better. I'll go away! Ya know? I got what I came to get. My money right, ya nah mean. I'm good don't worry 'bout me I'm good. Ya know? This is about you now,. is it 'gon make you happy to see me gone?. Are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?. Are you just gonna forget about me? I meant nothin to you?. Is that what you sayin to me?. Cause ya breakin my heart.

For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash. To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash. I know you like pumps and boots. I like jeeps and coupes, so I grind all the time, just gimme some loot. I put a spell on you, I like to call it a spell. In the bedroom, workin' it well, I don't kiss and tell. But I don't care if you kiss and tell. You can tell your girlfriend the details. [Chorus x2- Olivia]. Summer, winter, spring, and fall. I'll be around to catch ya calls. Cause you're my baby (you're my baby). And I adore you. You always right, you're not my date.

spend some time,"Spend Some Time - Eminem , Obie Trice, Stat quo & 50cent (Composição: Eminem). [Introduction] (Eminem). If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say. For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way. I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one. Tryna pick myself up where I started from. [Verse 1](Obie Trice). I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control. Even though my penis was deep down in your hole. You should know between us we was like mates to soul. Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes. You was more or so the chalant type, I chose. To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose. That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows. In the beginning, friends we decided to roll. So who's responsible when you get excited, explode. And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold. But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate. We established this way before we became mates. So whats required is that you chill with all that fire. Get your desire when I retire. [Chorus]. Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine. I never thought I'd find someone to be mine. Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line. Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine. [Verse 2] (Eminem). I used to say I never met a girl like you before. Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are. Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters. Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers. Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for. Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore. You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours. All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls. If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad. When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off. But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off. It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on. You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue. And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me. And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly. Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me. It's true that I got shot in the heart. But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are. But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see. Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach. Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat. Before you make a decision that's life altering. And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave. You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring. [Chorus]. [Verse 3](Stat Quo). In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch. My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch. But you was different, thought we shared a covenant. Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this. Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit. Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick. I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit. Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss. We started off closer than close. But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth. And the final result, back in that same boat. I ask myself, do I love these hoes? NO!. (50 cent). Em introduced us, ""50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"". Then slid off and left her to kick it with me. I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips. With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick. We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast. Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass. Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline. Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind. She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too. Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?. Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice. Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?. [Chorus]"
still think im nothing (feat. jeremih),"Oh yeah. Look at you, you lil' dirty ass nigga you ain't shit. Ouuh. Bongo By The Way. They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing. Yeah.

I'm up nigga. If I ever said fuck you nigga I meant to. When you come up how I came up, life's not gentle. See that tear in my mama eye, that meant the rent due. I prayed on it, God didn't say nothing back. Saw that cocaine you had, we turned it to crack. Had a couple grams of diesel, we was just tryna make it. A brown sheepskin on, niggas was tryna' take it. You know the kind of drama that come with the leather bomber. Niggas try to jump you gotta stay with the lama. Suckers shit niggas get shot over some nah, nah. If niggas want problems I'm sayin' this no problem. I catch 'em on the late night and dearly depart 'em. Look back. Look where we started from. It's all the beginning. They ain't tell me why we come this far. Now they feel it in the air. When it's 2am and the sky is filled with stars. Driving down the boulevard. I remember when. They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing. Yeah. Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting. Look at me now nigga. Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out. Y'all niggas ain't shit. They all act like they ain't know bet they know now. I'm up nigga. I remember all the shit you said to me 'cause it hurt me. Then it helped me 'cause then I was down to do the dirt. See the knots in my pockets boy, I go the cash route. I see you with your skinny jeans, punk, with your ass out. And I got all kind of money now. Look what you made me. Got a different type of temper, man a nigga get crazy. My A. P. look like I done dipped it in water, hard. Like me when I done dipped in your daughter (God!). From playin' with Hot Wheels to collecting cars. That shit in the dupont Registry's in my yard. Somehow the bullshit shifted. Now the motherfuckers calling me gifted. And I be like. Look back. Look where we started from. It's all the beginning. They ain't tell me why we come this far. Now they feel it in the air. When it's 2am and the sky is filled with stars. Driving down the boulevard. I remember when. They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing. Yeah. Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting. Look at me now nigga. Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out. Y'all niggas ain't shit. They all act like they ain't know bet they know now. I'm up nigga"

stunt 101,"[Chorus]. [50 Cent]. I'll teach you how to stunt. My wrists stay rocked up. My TV's pop up in a Mercedez benz. I'll teach you how to stunt. Nigga you can't see me. My bently GT got smoke gray rims. I'll teach you how to stunt. My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man. I'll teach you how to stunt. I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans. I'll teach you how to stunt. [50 Cent]. Seven series BM, Six series benz. Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims. All on one wheel when I'm on one of them. Ma, that boy out there actin a fool that's him. They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy. They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy. My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace. Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me. And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold. As long as the VS bling, look at that light show. In the hood they say Fifty man your sneaker look white yo. Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho. Banks is a sure thing, yall niggaz might blow. I'm fittin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low. Buc, he from Cashville, Tenneckee nigga. Getting them ten of keys, save ten for me nigga. [Chorus]. [Lloyd Banks]. I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rappin. But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?. Me on the corner, ??, hand covered with platinum. Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one. On point, cuz you get R.I.P.'s when slacking. So the stashbox big enough to squeeze the mack in. Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect. Cuz I already wear your advance on my neck. I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches. Blue yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers. I already figured out what to do with all my features. Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers. When it comes to stuntin' theres nothing you can teach us. We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us. Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt. Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT. [Chorus]. [Young Buc]. Chain so icy, you don't have to like me. In a throwback jersey, with the throwback nikes. I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the. days. The only thing changed is the numbers on the range. I bought me an old school and blew out the brains. The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain. My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing. And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game. Come on now, we all know gold is getting old. The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold. G-Unit homie, actin' like yall don't know. Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more. I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes. They never seen doors lift up on a car before. Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know. That's how to show these fougaisies how it's supposed to go. [Chorus]"

But bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service. on sunday morning. [Verse 1]. I make so many mistakes, so many corrections. I'm so far from perfect, so many imperfections. But I'm a go getta, I get up and go get it. So if you're preaching prosperity, I wanna hear it. I make the hood look good, turn the base into base line. Punch lines to white lines, run from the one time. My verse is like a graphic scene, close your eyes. Now you seen the dope fiend lean. And you seen the pimp pimp hoes. The 4-4 blow and niggas puff dro. Like there's no tomorrow. Hit that pass that, that's the motto. You know jail's like vacation for my friends. They go away, come home and do the same shit again. You think I'm bad, man they don't give a fuck. They trying do what they gotta do to get a buck. [Chorus]. Me, I ain't got to send a usher around. with baskets or talk to a choir. But nigga I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher. on sunday morning. Me, I run the streets all week, hustle hard, I do work to get buy. But bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service. on sunday morning. [Verse 2]. I take the line out the good book an eye for an eye. Shoot me I shoot you back, I don't care if you die. First the sun comes down, then the sun goes up. And the coke price too when the Ds make a bust. It's freeze nigga, get the fuck on the wall and. Everything you worked for, they come to take it all. Man it's like they don't know what they taking. Hit you with the tazer, I'll have you sizzling like bacon. When you pray say a prayer for me, a nigga could use it. Through my pain there's a piece of me in all of my music. Go head you can judge me, I'm hoping you love me. I see I got it mastered, muh muh muh magic. Hocus pocus keep the bitches focused. Before we pop up on that ass with toasters. Lord forgive me I'm regressing again. Forgive me for that line and the rest of my sins. [Chorus]. Me, I ain't got to send a usher around with baskets. or talk to a choir. But nigga I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher. on sunday morning. Me, I run the streets all week, hustle hard, I do work to get buy. But bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service. on sunday morning"

Nevermind a horse, im in a porsche, its my turn to floss. Dont put me in a mix of your rap lies. Diss me, Ill dip you in toilet water so you can get baptized. I grew up with the peasants in the halls. Elevators is broke, probably had asbestos in the walls*. Now haters get wreckless with the calls. Cuz Im fuckin their bitch and they buyin breakfast in the morn. Not to mention, he dresses in the malls. New Prada footwear, Nexino necklace with the bars*. I dont care if you over 300 pounds, dont seduce me. You'll get your big ass cut up like Bruce Lee. I wont stop till my starve eat. We got tools, thatll spin your ass around like a 5 heart beat*.

If you say murder that means I'm a Thug Poet. If I say my mind kills that means I'm a Thug Poet. If I say that I'm a flock that means I'm a Thug Poet. And when I lay it down, it makes me a Thug Poet. [Broady Boy]. Thank the dudes for the gangs and tanks of booze. Shanks and twos, it's the gangstas, Langston Hughes. My poems' about broken homes and Jesus peaces. Dope is the Popes in Rome. Poetical field, thug overtone, it's like what, yo?. Bring it home, we both go gone. Pre-cord thought flow in the sober zone. My life style, chromosomes frost, hope to clone. The crack lust, black dust, and the gat bust. The claps, the lackluster, memoirs of the black hustler. Condos, Beemers, bomb hoes, coke bags, toe tags, John Does. Fiends skits them into the plane of day, as plain as day. It's hard to reach, to smell God anyway. Money, think backdrop payin' gray?. Man, rubber-gripped on that rainy day. Peep the way I came to play. One aim at the game, reign and stay. Every stain is straight from objective, insane. 'Ey just don't know, I'm two ticks from blowing a hole through music. But I'm more than pimp-whoring him for the street wise. You met the ren. Cuz I open 'neath in the weed, hydrogen. Jam my eyes to skin, guide some of our wisest men. Until the skies of sin. I pray for the day we see you rise again. Uh. [Nas] [Broady]. Thug Poet Street analyst is this, the. Thug Poet Hustlers bang out to. Thug Poet Flows for your block, Hip-Hop. Thug Poet. Thug Poet. [50 Cent]. Aiyyo, everybody know 50 ain't know how to act. I run up on cats with gats and aluminum bats. Y'all got fat while we starved, it's my turn. Shit, I done felt how a slug burned, I still won't learn. Niggas in the 'hood a-tell ya ""50 crazy"". I had your moms screamin' ""They done shot my baby"". Son, I yap your shine, I clap the nine, I slap you. I'm that one of them niggas you wanna fuck with. I spit the shit that make ya keep listenin'. Keep my wrists glistenin'. I left niggas alone and they still think I'm dissin' 'em. I'm on some new shit, S-Type baby blue shit. Niggas talk behind my back but don't do shit. I ain't looking for love, duke, I'm looking for respect. I leave you with options, like die or hit the deck. I'm a thug poet, you know what I came for, the dough. Clap-clap, y'all niggas get the fuck on the floor, floor. [Nas] (Echoes to fade). Thug Poet"

till a colapse freestyle,"[Intro]. G-g-g G Unit!. 50 Cent. Shady. Aftermath. The Dream Team. We gotta get the ""Get Well"" cards. Niggas is sick. Feel this. Motion picture shit. Hahahaha. [50 Cent]. Now don't think I won't hit ya 'cause I'm popular. I got a P90 ruger, gonna pop at ya. Catch ya slippin', I'mma give ya what I got for ya. My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya. You never had a hot gun on your waste and blood on your shoe. 'Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you. Homie you ain't been through, what I been through. You not like me and I'm not like you (ha!). I'm like an animal with it when I spit it, it's crazy. Got semi-autos and put holes in niggas tryna play me. One shot is not enough, you need at least an uzi to move me. After four bottles of ""Don,"" the kid start feelin' woozie. I write my life, you write what you seen in gangsta movies. I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me. I find my space at the top. I got this rap shit locked. I never heard of you, you heard of me. I murder you, spray shells through your convertible. Lotus, you notice. Rich or poor, hollows still go through your door. This is war. You scared of me, you not prepared for me. The kid is back, 50 Cent. I know you like that, yea I know you like that. [Eminem]. Soon as a verse starts i eat at MC's heart. what is he thinkin? how not to go against me smart. and its absurd how people hang on every word. I'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve. but I'll never be served. my spot is forever reserved. if i ever leave earth. that would be the death of me first. cuz in my heart of hearts i know nothin. could ever be worse. thats why im clever when i put together every verse. my thoughts are sporatic. i act like im an addict. i rap like am addicted to smack. like im kim mathers. but i dont wanan go forth and back. in constant battles. the fact is i would rather sit back. and bomb some rappers. so this is like a full blown attack. im launching at 'em. the track is on some battleing. rap who want some static. cuz i dont really think that the fact that im Slim matters. a plaque in platinum status is wack if im not the baddest. CHORUS:. Till the roof comes off. till the lights go out. till my legs give out. cant shut my mouth. till the smoke clears out. and my high burns out. I'ma rip this shit. till my bone collapse. till the roof comes off. till the lights go out. till my legs give out. cant shut my mouth. till the smoke clears out. and my high burns out. I'ma rip this shit. till my bone collapse. until the roof, the roof comes off. until my legs, give out from underneath me. I, i will not fall. i will stand tall. feels like no one can beat me"

Some cock that, aim, that take money. ""How To Rob"" was an warning not a joke. Cause niggas in the hood is really tired of being broke. These cats quick to splurge on luxurious things. And when we come through they tuck chains and turn their rings. Diamonds, you bought that?. They gon' take that. [G&B]. I'm chillin' on the corner. With a dollar in my pocket. The deed go bye-bye cause my man's watchin'. Shit is hard in the ghetto. But we still get by. (We still get by). Every day I see the same ol' problems. But it seems like we're never gonna solve them.

I'm tired of being broke. Being locked down ain't no joke. Why must we live this way?. [G&B]. I'm livin' in a world where they ain't no windows. And when you're rich it seem so simple. Kind of hard for you to understand struggle. But this is my life, ha. And I know one day we're gonna change it. Let the game blow it up and rearrange it. Till then we do whatever we can. In the end it's a brand new life that we living in. Repeat 1 (2x). [50 Cent]. Uh-huh come on. Don't nobody smile when I come through. But they say I'm a funny cat. I lose shooting dice. Pull out take my money back. Fifty ain't the type to be runnin' his mouth. Uh-huh, Fifty run with dem kids that'll run in your house. If these rappers were killers I would've been dead. But they all aim at my legs instead of my head. I'm giving out ass whoopins while you're givin' out hugs. I figured out niggas respect fear more than love. Repeat 1. [G&B](50 Cent). I said you don't know. Like I know, oh. I said you don't know. Like the Product no, oh. (Refugee Camp). I said you don't know. Like my fellas no. (G&B). I said you don't know what it feels like to be broke. [50 Cent]. East Coast, West Coast. Up North, the Dirty South. This goes out to all my thugs. Worldwide I see the struggle. Try and stay alive, ya heard?. One love, yeah one love, yo"

I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy. Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly. Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really. Pussy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly. Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire!. Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit. Every bootlegger you know, bump my shit, bitch!. [Chorus]. The Invasion! (Invasion yeah). Green Lantern! the infiltration, we comin'! (yeah). [Bridge: Eminem]. I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit.

If it's two pairs or it's one. It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you. You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe. I don't know what it is or what it could be. But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me. Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me. Y'all tickle me pink. I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me. Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety. A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy. Mixed with a little bit of the [Eminem vocal scratch]. Wit a pinch of Biggie.

I teach niggaz sign language, that ain't def son. *click* *click* you heard that? That mean RUN. Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stun on, pa. Pull through, I'll throw a fuckin cocktail at ya' car. From the last shootout, I got a demple on my face. It's nothin', I could go after Mase's fanbase. Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out. Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out. I don't smile a lot, cause ain't nothin' pretty. Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City. Hos be like ""Fitty, you so witty"". On the dick like they heard I go straight for P.Diddy. You got fat while we starve, it's my turn. I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn. Won't learn. [Chorus 2X]. If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me. You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me. Besides, you ain't got no drive - You not like me. Like me dawg, you not like me. [Verse 2]. Moma said... Everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan. So at night when I talk him, I got my gun in my hand. Don't think I'm crazy, cause I don't fear man. Cause I feel when I kill a man, God won't understand. I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan. I been coulda killed these niggaz, I'm still waitin. In the telly with to whores, a Benz with to doors. 32 carrots in the traws, no flaws. You see me in the hood, I got atleast two guns. I carry the glock, Tony carry my M-1s. Hold me down nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me. D's waitin for my response to lock me.

My attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef. You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me. From 3 point range, with a glock, I shoot better then Kobe. See a nigga standin' next to me, he probably my Co-D. See a bitch gettin in my whip, she probably gon' blow me. See the flow is like a 38, it's special yoooooo. A country boy tell ya, I'm fittin' to blowwwww. I'm more like a pimp, then a trick, you knowwww. See, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hooos. Niggaz broke in the hood, worried about mines. Grown ass men, wearin starter piece shines. You know them little pieces, with the little stones. Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones. When the gossip starts, I'm always the topic. You too old for that shit dog, why don't you stop it. Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me. Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me. Haha. [Chorus 2x]. If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me. You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me. Besides, you ain't got no drive - You not like me. Like me dawg, you not like me."

Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number. She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman"". Think im'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'.

Im'a stop at your house and blow the horn. If you come outside you know it's on. Bitches be frustrated with the baller. Qonder why I call her. Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spall her. Hickups annoy ya from time to time I gotta ignore her. In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more. She loves it when I'm in town. Hate it when I'm not around. I get her and wed down. Next door neighboors hear the sound. Pictures hittin' the ground. Just enough to hold us down. I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round. Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy. I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady. I admit I fell in love with a frame. And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government. name. Her panties wet over fame. Fall in love with my chain. I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain. Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only. I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.. (Yeah) What would fuck me up more. Watching her lick her lips. Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man. I sweet talking her if she like. Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right. Look I'm legit now used to break laws. Now you can reap the benefit of world tours. Big house big Benz girl it yours. Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws. You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you. All you gotta do is love me and be loyal. Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you. Cause their be some honies gonna hate you that never saw you. Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me. Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me. Let me ride on you and you can ride on. We can do it all the night. We can have a balla night. I wanna be your lawyer. I really wanna defend you, baby. I'm lost in your lovin'. I'm simply gonna try you, crazy. I wanna be your lover. I wanna get to know you, baby. I'm lost in your lovin'. I'm simply gonna try you, crazy. I wanna be your lover. I really need to stand you, baby. I wannt be your lover. I really need to stand you, baby, baby, baby, baby."

warning you (don't turn on me) (feat. skylar grey),"[Skylar Grey]. When they say my time is up, and. I am just collecting dust. Don't turn on me. Don't turn on me. And when they claim that I'm washed up. Or when my guns begin to rust. I'm warning you. Don't turn on me. December 9, '97 I told Jay I'm gonna blow. Failing's not an option. My son's turning twenty one years old. I wrote a verse about the night. I just spent in Central bookings. Cause my grandpa coffee pot had cocaine cookie. Fast forward my grind, 9-8-99 more eigths more O's. Broken in nickels and dimes. I told niggers I'd make it, they was doubting me then. Picture me zonin' on the park bench pushin' my pit. Who needs enemies my friends keep shootin' my friends. They takin' hits now, they'll blow your brains out for a biz. Call me a dreamer, cause I could see myself on top. Word to Sabrina I'm gettin' my ass off this block. [Skylar Gre]. When they say my time is up, and. I am just collecting dust. Don't turn on me. Don't turn on me. And when they claim that I'm washed up. Or when my guns begin to rust. I'm warning you. Don't turn on me. Don't turn on me. No, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't. No, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't. Don't turn on me. I'm warning you. (No, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't). Don't turn on me. Ain't it funny how them niggers that came over. want to pop on me. Product of the slum, I guess its misery loves company. Told mama when I be something to believe in. They was more concerned who was rollin' up the weed did. Jay & Jay didn't work, neither did Columbia. Got shot, got dropped, one helluva summer huh?. One year recovery feel like a bag of broken bones. Bill collectors come around. that's when you know you're on your own. Strap the vest, cock the chrome, they countin' me out. I'mma show em. I fought my way out of mother fuckin' corners before. I'm better under pressure I'm built for it. Been the under dog all my life, I'm still here boy. [Skylar Grey]. When they say my time is up, and. I am just collecting dust. Don't turn on me. Don't turn on me. And when they claim that I'm washed up. Or when my guns begin to rust. I'm warning you. Don't turn on me. Don't turn on me. EM and DRE gave me a shot and I ran with it. Homie in the cell saying ""damn, my man did it"". ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" made it to the top. I'm fighting off my competition, trying not to drop. It seems like no one seen him fuckin' with the key. All they see was me tryna take off their fuckin' head. They don't see the slap, all they hear is the shot. As soon as somebody hit. I'm sure they'll run to the cops. I'm not a bully of the East. if I don't start no beef. I meet aggression with aggression. I learned that on the streets. I see em fronting on they blogs, sayin' I'm done. Like I ain't got that flow they know be number one. [Skylar Grey]. When they say my time is up, and. I am just collecting dust. Don't turn on me. Don't turn on me. And when they claim that I'm washed up. Or when my guns begin to rust. I'm warning you. Don't turn on me. Don't turn on me"
warrior part ii,"[Intro - Eminem]. Remix [echoes]. Lloyd Banks! [echoes]. Ha ha! [echoes]. [Verse 1 - Eminem]. It's like a throne that he dont even own. He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around. It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing. He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry. He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport. Runnin suckaz with the competition round the court. He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it. And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it. You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short. But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it. And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys. And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it. [Chorus - Nate Dogg]. This Is The Story Of A Warrior U Kno U Kno It.

He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate. They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate. Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate.

Cuz he horrendous when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand. So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan. Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name. When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game. And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them. G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them. [Chorus - Nate Dogg].

Everything new. Spikes on the Louis Vuittons. We up, nigga!. [Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]. ?Round the world tourin', the city got boring. Bury me a G with a new pair of Jordans. Coupe foreign, top peeled like an orange. Blue Ferrari, so many iron horses. Living life with no worries. My gun got a Zodiac sign, it's a Taurus. Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e. M-Zone Rida Gang end the story. Oops, that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry. She call me daddy too, we should be on Maury. Everything you aren't, fly nigga soaring. Purple label Ralph Lauren, kick game like Atari. You so special, bedroom or restroom,. Just keep performing, go girl"

Yellow-Bottle and Don P. the warm zone. Now, they spit fire through the mouth as a Pokemon. When I remember that 'loca'. Killers entering the school of Yoga. I'll fly in Corolla. Bentley is in the workshop. Buying condoms, you see me in a sex-shop. From LA to New York, also trafficked that BULLSHIT. They want to be on my side, which is the NEWSHIT?. Burning the bitch here on the roof nigger. Ending all Don P and all liquor. Breaking the Hood, ending with his gang. Game down, play in life, you put it out of the game. His photo will print a box of cereal. You have your face on CNN in a video. An upturn is on your head, and I in Rio. [chorus- 50 Cent]2x. They don't want to go out on our side. They just want to leave your side. Nigga hey, nigga woo. 50 & Yay' what can you do?. [verse2- Yayo]. No more drama nigger. Come on my crew. This is my new. My gun continues with that shine.

what goes around ft. lloyd banks,"[50 Cent] G-Unit haha. [Lloyd Banks]. I dont know where you from but out here we ride. So if you scared of conflict don't come outside. Get your hands on a gun. Cause ain't no one gonna repspect you as a man if you run, dial 9-1-1. I'm hear talkin' to the street now. That's only gonna lead to bulletwounds and beatdown's, retreat clown. You still strugglin down to your last rock. G-Unit is gorillas and Blackchild's the mascot. You thought you wouldn't hear my voice. I'm in the hood cause I'm hood. You in the hood cause you ain't got no choice. Your top seller gettin' sticked for his shine. Either I'm blind, or Ashanti's sideburns is thicker than mine. I'm youngest in charge with my dick in a dime. Grippin' the nine, sippin' that lime. Becardi in a party, you sorry. I'm blowin' wet green right out the safari. That'll put you in a left lean higher than a marley. And as far as Charlie, a studio hour is a waste. She look like she took a bag of flour in the face. You want street credibility instead of I'ma sting you. C'mon Ja you put a fuckin crackhead on your single. [Chorus: 50 Cent]. What goes up must come down, what goes around comes back around. I suggest you run when you see the pound. Or get laid the fuck out on the ground. What goes up must come down, what goes around comes back around. I suggest you run when you see the pound. Or get laid the fuck out on the ground. [Lloyd Banks]. My cousin bringin' back them blueberry bags, I've been waiting all day. On them Shelltops that got Jam Master Jay, on 'em. I got a jeanius and kneehighs that swallows me whole. Tongue's longer than the ones on your Fila's. She's buys anything I desire, prolly cause I'm on fire. The 2003 McGwire, until I retire. My neighborhood breed ballers that slam dunk. Cross overed to crack now they can't even jump. I leave with any panties I want, the industries new face. I'm in a bitch mouth every morning like toothpaste. Place your bet, Envy pull out a few crates. I got enough 16's to battle 2 states. I'm in a spaceship, neck full of grey shit. Bigetes in the braclet, expect nothing basic. Respect and embrace it, your sketch in the basement. I'll have them try to find where the rest of your face is. [Chorus]. [Lloyd Banks]. The hoes know I'm lazy as hell, that's why I get the bitch to twist. Dogg, I stay around trees like Christmas gifts. Yea, you laughing and dancing 'til they stick you. And have you holdin' your chest like I'm singing the National Anthem. Have your worried bout the reprecussions after the tantrum. I'll be alone in a mansion, and it's snowing in the Hamptons. Regardless of what these fools say, I'ma be around longer than 'Cool J. Armed with a new K. So dumb in a new way, If I don't fuck Monday, I'm gone hit it Tuesday. My charm get it usually. You put a lot of years into rap, these lil' starvin' chumps. Start your career from the back of a milk carton. Your gased up from whatever he must of told ya. But everything in Army fatigues ain't a soldier. In my upbring we wore the same socks. And buckets in the living room to catch the rain drops. [Chorus]. [50 Cent]. Dial 9-1-1, Yeah!, young Lloyd Banks,. GGgg, GGgg, GGgg, G-Unittttt, haha. I dare you to say something, haha,. I dare you to say something back nigga..."

who u rep wit,"f/ Bravehearts, Nas. [Verse 1 - Nas]. Hats off, to da rich ones who flash and floss. Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north. Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist. Only wishin' we could bring them back with songs like dis. Old flicks on us chillin' wit da old time click. Holdin' nines, thoughts of death, not our lives we risk. How it use to be, early morn, pumpin' in shifts. Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest. They handcuff me, they knew my government and alias. Various calls were made up for awarin' us. The D's in the marked vans and cabs. In our land, hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty. Turnin' out young lady's and make them make thoughties. Got them coked out, the hood is bugged out. Thug babies, famous in they strollers. Before they walk they knew the hood talk. It's in the air of New York. So everybody'll pick em up, kissin em up. Treatin' them like they own, in dis hood we call home. Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out. Circle of life, it's kinda deep how we end out.. [Chorus]. Yo them niggas that wanted beef before. Don't want no beef no mo. Now that they know who I rep with. QB NIGGA!!!. Who I rep with. QB NIGGA!!! (repeat). [Verse 2 - 50 Cent].

On da strength of da inf, from long range I can hit ya. You find out them niggas who wit ya ain't even wit ya. After da gem stars split ya, you need an MD to stitch ya. Peep how I use words to paint pictures. Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin' me for ten cents to got hit ya. Look my name up in the law book, Curtis Jackson. Known for creatin' action, by rapidly clappin'. Nigga I stay strapped, so much I nickname gats. Got a tech I call Tina, a nine I name Nina. Two niggas went to see Allah afta they seen her. This QB shit, bout to take me to da next level. Next crib, next Benz, next bitch, next bezel.. It's that real.. [Chorus]. [Verse 3 - Bravehearts] (Millennium Thug, Horse, Jungle, Wiz). Yo, aiyyo, who da fuck wanna war. I got a four four, pierce ya'll niggas jaw. You see me thugged out, iced out, Guinness Stout. Hopin' out the Range wit da gun out. Smack your man down, you ran off. I was gonna hit him with two, I left some for you. I put four, QB rugged and raw. I got somethin' for these rap cats, fish held back gats. Scope wit a beam on it, loc put your cream on it. Shine don't scheme on it, I make your dream about it. Forever, whatever whatever get gully. Shots thru your leather and clothe, With your skelly off. Break ya'll clowns off. Yo hollow tips will flood your jacket, I don't give a fuck who you be. Millennium Thug, now who da fuck want it with me.. I mastered the art of slap boxin' niggas in da dark. QB's big man, Horse of the Bravehearts. I'm da Sasquash of rap, collector of gats. Testin' macks at your bulletproof vests and hats.. How bout that, guns bust off, I bust back.

But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out. When there's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out. If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it. It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it. We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit. And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it. And let it go to whoever's holdin' the most current people on their shoulders. And their soldiers got their backs till it's over. But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody. We came to party, Banks, Ca$his and Mr. Ferrari. So it's Shady Aftermizat back in that ass, you wizzass. Come hizzon what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that. [50 Cent & Eminem]. Who run it?.

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine. Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams. Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see.
