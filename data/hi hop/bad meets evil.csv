fast lane,"[Royce Da 5'9"":]. First verse, uh. I'm on 'til I'm on a island. My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot. Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with' kindness. I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse. You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form. Slap up a cop and then snatch 'I'm out of his uniform. Leave him with' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on. And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn. Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know. Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'. Bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole. Me and Shady deaded the past. So that basically resurrected my cashflow. I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke. Though I ain't wrapped tight. My blood type's the '80s!. My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys. You still fly kites daily!. [Eminem:]. Catch me in my Mercedes. Bumpin' ""Ice, Ice Baby, "" screamin' Shady 'til I die. Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy. So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze. And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady. Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Damn). Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is. 'cause she's kinda famous. And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this. Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!. You morons think that I'm a genius. Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin',. Try them trailer parks. Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby. And that's back with' a capital B with' an exclamation mark, maybe. You should listen when I flip the linguistics. 'Cause I'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit. You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit. 'Cause after I spit the bullets. I'm a treat these shell casings like a soccer ball. I'm a kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'm a live this. [Chorus:]. Livin' life in the fast lane. Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down. Only got a gallon in the gas tank. But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now. I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride. Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die. I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). [Royce Da 5'9"":]. My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit. At war with' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs. My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins. I made a pact with the Devil that says ""I'll let you take me. You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse, Jack Kevorkian"". Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in. I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down. My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers. Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity. [Eminem:]. Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper. Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out. Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down. He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now. Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town. Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck them all, he's just. A whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time a-r-r-round. And he came to the club tonight with' 5'9? to hold this bitch down. Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown. Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated. Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips,. I'm agitated, aggravated. To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated. Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it. [Royce Da 5'9"":]. And then after takin' that, I'm a catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'. It's gon' say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affadavit. Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator. To Michael Jackson' activator (Woo!). Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data. Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer. Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater. Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper. Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent). [Eminem:]. Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes. What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator. Brung ya lay to this party, be my penis ejaculator later. Tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt. You rollin' with' a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'. [Chorus:]. Livin' life in the fast lane. Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down. Only got a gallon in the gas tank. But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now. I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride. Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die. I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). Life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). Pedal to the metal. Pedal to the metal, metal, metal. Cr√©dito: LE0Sousa"
lighters (feat. bruno mars),"[Bruno Mars:]. This one's for you and me, living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters. [Eminem:]. By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up. I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up. If I was you, I would duck,. or get struck like lightening. Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up,. point em' skyward uh. Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king?. This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking. Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me. I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music. There is or there ever will be, disagree. Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up. The only thing I ever gave's using no more excuses. Excuse me if my head is too big for this building. And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick. but you cocks are slick. Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around,. crock-o-shit. Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick,. you did the opposite. You stayed the same,. just cock back with this still cock you pricks. I love it when I tell em shove it. Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall said bust a leg. Muster cause he couldn't cut mustard mustered up nothing. Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz. Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it. Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head. Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?. Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off. Little hussy ass, cause f-ck it,. guess it doesn't matter now, does it. What difference it make?. What it take to get it through your thick skulls. As if this ain't some bullshit. People don't usually come back this way. From a place that was dark as I was in. Just to get to this place. Now let these words be like a switch blade. to a haters rib cage. And let it be known from this day forward. I wanna just say thanks. cause your hate is what gave me strength. So let em cause I came with 5'9' but I feel like I'm 6'8'. [Bruno Mars:]. This one's for you and me,. living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters. [Royce Da 5'9"":]. By the time you hear this. I'll probably already be outtie. I advance like going from toting iron to going. From buying 4 or 5 of the homies to iron man outtie. My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin to blow it. And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute. To tell Shady I love him. the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic. Tell him how real he is or high I am. Or how I would kill for him for him to know it. I cried many tears, my daddy got a bad back. So it's only right that I right till he can march. Right into that post office and tell em to hang it up. Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years. I'll stop when I'm at the very top. You shitted on me on your way up. It's bout to be a scary drop. Cause what goes up must come down. You going down on something. you don't wanna see like a hairy box. Every hour, happy hour now. Life is wacky now. Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy. Now I'm just the cats meooww, ow. Classic cow, always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao. Ya'll are doomed. I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me. My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes. Cause now I'm in the Aston. I went from having my city locked up. To getting treated like ? Patrick. And now I'm fantastic. Compared to a weed high. And y'all niggas just gossiping like bitches on a radio and TV. See me, we fly. Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive. And how real is that. I remember signing my first deal and now. I'm the second best I can deal with that. Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag. [Bruno Mars:]. You and I know what it's like. To be kept down, forced to fight. But tonight we're alright. So hold up your light. Let it shine. Cause this one's for you and me. Living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. With my arms out wide I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters"
loud noises (ft. slaughterhouse),"--0Share. How it works. Click the orange lyrics for explanations. Highlight white lyrics and explain them to get Rap IQ? (help). [Verse 1: Eminem]. Life handed me lemons. I jump back into the public eye and squirted lemon juice in it. By now you just wish I?d fucking die but I electrify. Get electrocuted, executed by an executioner of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zooming by. Guess who, what?s happening guys?. They told me to shit, I fell off that pot. Hoped right back up on that crapper and I. Said ?fuck you? with a capital I. Look who?s back to antagonize. You don?t like it? You can eat shit, fuck off little faggot and die. You right back like a maggot on my dick grabbing at my shit. better get to the back of the line. You wanna get your shot at me what kinda crap is that. Battle, what kind of rapper would I be before I let another rapper think he?s hot. I?ll bury my face in his stinky twat and go alalalala. Go ahead, space is limited, ain?t even room in the back of my mind. That?s why I ain?t thinking about you, I don?t got time and I told you a thousand times. So how can I find the time to put an alkaline battery in royce's back and at the same time put juice in mine?. Goddamnit Slaughterhouse is signed. [Verse 2: Royce da 5'9""]. I?m a menace villain, my pen is sitting spilling, my livers killing. Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceiling. The niggas willing to give the listeners the sickest feeling. Like mixing some Benadryl and penicillin. Then I?m filling the clip with a written. Can you picture my pistol drilling?. A million women and children when I?m illing. But it isn?t real, it?s a rap. On the real, it?s a wrap. How could you possibly stop the Apocalypse. When I?m atomic bombing the populous. Shock the metropolis hostile as a kid. Popping the Glock at his moms and his pops. Then he hops in his drop with his iPod rocking the Slaughterish. Documentation and lyrics I write with confidence. Write like a columnist slash novelist. I?m in this game to demolish, establish my dominance. Over prominent rappers you popping shit till you opposite. I can spit ominous so spit politics now I?m Haile Selassie, Gandhi, and Pac of this hip hop genre, bitch. [Voice]. SlaughterHouse!. [Verse 3: Crooked I]. Lyrically I?m a cocaine Altoid. Ability to bring ? it?s a no brain bout boy. Physically I?m literally a cocaine cowboy. Wait wait, did I just go almost four bars. Without talking about my big dick?. The other day me and your thick bitch had a great day and we ate cake. And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost. Cause she couldn?t handle my shit, wait I sweared. Irony of Ryan is I am bipolar while I?m rhyming standing beside a big old white bear. Neither one of us fight fair, you are literally looking at Woody and Wesley in a movie. With a white boy ain?t got to jump no where cause I?m here. Nigga I?m on fire yeah and I?m every bitch?s dream. One, two I?m coming for you, I?m a big old nightmare. Nigga this the slaughter stepping up. I?ll pretty much slap your ass and tell you to shut the fuck up. After that I?ll slap your ass again and tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up. And that?s how you body a fucking beat. [Voice]. [Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]. I should be the one that goes slow. Get a stopwatch, clock my flow. Hit the button on top watch the drug drop. ? when I drop I go outer space. Like I?m like Darth Vader?s face. Placed in a molten shower. Say something and get them proper. Mama poppa pouring out vodka. Mama Mia, Em pass me the seeds. It?s ? Slaughterhouse ? better yet boy go home, better yet boy ?. Better jet boy, Mark Sanchez, Santanio Holmes. I?m not just any old homeboy. Sitting in a lab picking up a pad. I be spitting bad, I?mma get you mad with this gift I have. Lord duck sufferin succotash when the trigger blast I?mma put your beak on your fitted hat. Where the liquor at? Sip of yak. That bitchh and a vicious track ?. Sly Pro tools to boast Joe smooth I coast to the West like we?re tired of living at. New York here?s a piggyback ride to the motherland. Hold on brotherman, on the other hand get down. I?m gutter fam, gun butt you with the Eagle handle Cunningham. I don?t wanna talk, I just wanna beef. I don?t want a piece, I want it all baby boy. I don?t wanna eat, I wanna feast up ? rough piece of shit. You done weak, I?m the one, capiche?. [Voice]. SlaughterHouse!. [Verse 5: Joe Budden]. Insane what they call us. Ain?t married to the game but you probably shouldn?t have came to the altar. Every bar like propane for the sawed-off, using ? to forge you. Eminent Mr. Porter, slaughter my cinnamons emminent torture. All of you feminine marauders, that?s women at war. Men will assault you, time is a bastard symbol of ?. Kidnap your trembling daughter, at least a quarter. I?m administering supporters, got an aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah. Normally something?s wrong with me. Claiming a quantity of the porn I see on the pause to me. When I fix the game they?ll think s**t came with a warranty. How the fuck are they gonna stop ? born to be. Corner me, shit belong to me, two choices, you can get along with me. Or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy. Wait, all you missing is heels to be RuPaul. Ain?t nobody that?s real ever knew y?all. Second to none and I?m dealing with Marshall. This time I never come down, deal with the blue balls. You ain?t gotta fear me but you?ll respect me. N****s who never met me threaten me. Why don?t you let me come ? I got some machetes. Swinging spaghetti like it?s heavy ? deserve an ESPY. In a Chevy like Andretti, put the Dezzy where his chest be.

I give you my all and you still take from me. VERSE ONE - Royce. Always been the type of dude that'll feed my clique. I know that without the fans, I ain't shit. But y'all better read my lips. I don't spit raps this ill, for you to just hack and steal. And leak my shit, so peep my drift. I hope y'all don't think you're helping me out with that shit. That shit stressin' me out. Nickel nine is blowin' up. Christmas time, you should hang my album on top of your fireplace. Cause around that time, my stocking's goin' UP. Feels like a victory, bittersweet, cause the bigger I get?. The bigger the wedge, between the relationship of me and my bigger bro. Hear what I said?. Feels like the shit just switched on me. Everything I do for the nigga, and the nigga know. I would do anything for him, but the nigga refuse. To just quit straight shittin' on me. Keepin' your distance? Probably best if you don't wanna fuck with me. But you know me probably best, fuck pity. You want that? You know it's like .... chest. Tough titty, the problems, you gotta problem, you think I'm already set. So I'mma look down on you? Just be proud of me. You already got my respect. I ain't gonna say something I regret. So I'mma just STOP, chasing the pain. Let you deal with the fact we don't get along cause. I got a big face in the game. Sometimes I feel like fuck my life. I fuck with a few niggas that I know that if my chick was a Shady ho?. Niggas wouldn't think twice before they fuck my wife. Guess that's the difference in friends and associates. I done been broke, I done been through the motions. I don't pay no attention to birds. I use my scope to tend to the vultures. No one ever blows up ..?.. talk. I don't make money just to lone it to y'all. Tell a nigga that the new album is like ...?.... is like talking to a hole in the wall. ..?..these niggas expensive. If I need to loan you money every time I see you just to be your friend?. I don't need your friendship. (hook) - Claret Jai. Is everything not enough?. What more can I give up?. Is there anyone that I can trust?. I give you my all and you still take from me. And I give, and I give. And you take, and you take. And you just walk away without nothing to say. And I give you my all and you just take from me (ay ay) x2. VERSE TWO - Eminem. I live in a bubble, I struggle with the fame. Trouble as the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say. When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away. To people who don't even appreciate flows, motherfucker, I'm living today. Cause I break my back to give you my art, you steal my thoughts. It's like driving a spike through my heart. You might think it's not that big of a deal to steal from me. But music is all I got. Aside from my daughters, not trying to sound like a martyr. But it's getting harder than I thought. To not just go crazy, trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap. And I might not deserve it but I got to, did I not work for it?. Put it all in every record I rip for. When the .... But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb like many think. SO FUCK THEM. They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they say it was ill, right?. The way I kill mics? But the way I feel right now?. It just feels like I'm so done with this shit I might as well wipe. I have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute. Farewell I bid you, but before I go, my last gift to you. Ladies and gentleman, Slaughterhouse I give you!. (hook). Develdiii"

Soon as I open the door, you try to resist, what for?. Get in girl, don't push (?). Fightin' a war, it's useless, tits on a whore, little tits on a whore. Got a mack and it's screaming like little kids throwing fits on the floor. Get in the whip, but you ain't turning, a frog into a prince. What you tryna keep your hands on me for?. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. Now you in my whip as long as you understand that I can't be whipped. You sick of my shit, I'm a gigolo so you know, I'm always on the go. I ain't got no time to slow down for no relationshit.

You heard, the verdict's in. He's allergic to D, that's the dick. [Royce]. I like the strip tease you doing. This evening, you and me gonna find. 3 more chickenheads and have a menage like Nick. You hot like a thick outfit in Texas. Without your underwear under it. Suck my dick, we both gets to steppin to my logic. [Eminem]. My dick is as hard as a yardstick. What we gonna do? Ride around til we're carsick. Then I'm gonna put this shit in park. And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot. Out of the trailer park by the garbage. What you waiting on? Me to roll up?. The condoms are in the glove compartment, lets start it!. Think I'm joking? What, am I sitting here. Trying to make fake farts with my armpits?. Am I here to amuse you?. [Royce]. I'm in your pocket outside of a church. The other hand is at the bottom of your purse. You giving me head in a boxing stance. My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt. I'm not your man, we're sparring partners. There's 5 things you are in charge of, that's. Sucking a dick, sucking a dick, sucking a dick. Sucking a dick, sucking a dick. [Eminem]. If you ain't sucking a dick. Why you sitting there with puckered lips? That's collagen... Motherfucking bitch, what you mean how'd you. Get suckered into this you gonna jump into my truck. And then try to get truculent?. [Royce]. You should be suffering, you should be cooking. You should be buckling your seatbelt with oven mitts. [Eminem]. I know I'm making an ass of myself, but it's just. Cause I wanna get... I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss.

vegas (feat. eminem),"[Chainsaw revving]. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. [Eminem]. Got a shit-eatin' grin. Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again. We're in Sin City. Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope. Diggity, bitch, you need to run. And go get your frigity-friends. I'm lookin' at your bum-stickity-bum, hun. The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack. You can get the fickity-finger; the middle. You little dizzy bitch, sit and spig-a-tee-spin. Got a 6 o'clock cravin', stop, get Ciroc. It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night. I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in. Hit the spot, spot my next victim. I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'. Came to sip vodka, shit. Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies. I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear. But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha). What are you: pit, rott, mixed?. Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then let's lip-lock. If not, then chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose. You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat. Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog. Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit. Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'. My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots. Like this shit's hoppin'. And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'. So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B. I. G. , Pac. Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this. If not, then kick rocks in flip flops. And I produced the track. So you don't have to ask who it is. When this shit knocks (Turn up!). So bring clairvoyance to this bangin'. And I'm a keep on sayin'. All the shit I should be hung for. And probably killed for sayin'. And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again. Like choppin' 'til I'm droppin'. Still if that don't do the job of killin' Shady. Then the karma will. They sayin' I must bring it as Mohammad. Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain. And made me Robin Williams crazy. Or I end up with dementia, but you rockin' with a sadist. Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertainin'. I ain't stoppin' till we sprayed it. Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shakin'. But before I tie a rope around this nob. If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until. Wait, I just forgot what I was thinkin'. What's it called again? I'm blankin'. The thing above the balls between my legs. And I think I can feel it dangling. It's throbbing and it's veiny. Wait, I think I got it, okay, bitch I got you. Robin Williams hangin'. Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me. Come on kemosabe. It's past time, like your favorite hobby. Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick. Then she grab me by the nuts. And tried to take my sausage as a hostage. Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer. Or should I say Cobainer?. That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit. Gotta wean her off it, weiner off it. Like she took my fucking penis, chopped it. And stuck it up between her armpits. And she begun to swing a crumpet knife. And paint the carpet, at least. That's what her train of thought is. Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it, quit it. And made up a plate of bonkers. And I always end up giving these bitches some complex. And I don't mean apartment. So spread your feet apart. And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits. Now grab this Cuisinart. And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite. And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch. Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?). Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?. I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick. Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks. To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick. Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit. Took an unexpected twist. Like the neck of the freaking exorcist. Cha-cha-cha. Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey. Hate Versace, Versace, I got M√ºnchhausen by proxy. I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me. You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy. I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre. Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car. And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit. And I think with my dick so come blow my mind. And it tastes like humble pie. So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride. If I let you run alongside the Humvee. Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski. So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy. You gon' blow that rape whistle on me. (Squee!) I love it. 'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off. Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway. And try not to get lost. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. Whatever happens here, stays here. So let's go all the way dear. Til we get to Las Vegas. [Royce da 5'9]. Whatever happens in my room. It stays in my room like movie night like cable. Treat every women in my stable like flavors. Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days. In 7 nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas. We roll in circles and packs, we the lifesavers. She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then. I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib waving. And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor. I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors. And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it. Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry store. With a about a million dollars with your mama. And sat down did an ALS challenge, haan. I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again. About to get my back tatted again. About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand. Sitting on a bike in the sand. If you ain't been through nothing. Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you. Like likes on the Gram. If she current I keep her pussy. Purring like the pipes on a Lamb. Weed got her so chinky eyed. Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan. I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking. Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can. Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss. If this is my passion. I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence. The gift of my absence. I don't know who you been listening to. Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop. Bitch, I don't give a two shits. Bitch, get the fuck out of my face. To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there. And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum. Even though I have an affinity for a witty banter. Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer. Hold up, she misunderstood me. I said saint, por favor. Thought I said the Wraith had four doors. I knock a nigga face off. Give him the bottom of the nine. Like a baseball scoreboard (whatever...). I leave the club with my tab still open. Won't even get a cab for you and your friend. The only fear I have is of loathing. And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas. [Eminem]. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. Whatever happens here, stays here. So let's go all the way dear. Til we get to Las Vegas"
the reunion,"(Eminem). Ay, yo. This next song, is a true story. (Come here, bitch!). Cause some things in this universe, don't make sense. But somehow always seem to fuckin' work. VERSE ONE - Eminem. Driving down I-75, about to hop on 696. I look over, this fucking chick's tryina' fix her makeup, I'm like bitch?. You ain't a plastic surgeon, I advise ya to put up your visor. I'm getting kinda ticked, you're blocking my side mirror. She's like yeah? so? I'm like so?. You gon' need a stitch you keep actin' like that, ho. I look like your husband slut? That's a rhetorical question. You talk to me like you talk to him, I'll fuck you up. In fact, get in the backseat, like the rest of my dates. No bitch rides shotgun, what? Taxi?. Stop and pick you some Maxi Pads up?. Is that what you actually ask me?. (smack). Bitch reaches over and smacks me. And says I annoy the fuck outta her. Get in the fucking back, put on your slut powder. You slut, what? Shut the fuck up now, or get your feelings hurt. Worse than my last chick, when I accidentally butt dialed her. And she heard me spreading age rumors about her. Turn the radio up louder, make it thump. While I bump that Relapse CD, tryina' hit every bump. In that...till I snap back in that accent. Cause she kept asking me to stop callin' her CUNT. I SAID THAT CUNT. HOOK - Eminem. She said, Marshall you ain't really like that, oh oh oh. Your putting on a show, where's your mic at?. Cause you're breaking my heart, you're breaking my heart. x2. VERSE TWO - Royce. Uh, pull up to the club in a Porsche, not a Pinto. While Marshall's at a white trash party, I'm at drama central. I walk up in there looking at my phone on twitter tweetin'. I'm feelin' a bunch of bitches lookin' at a nigga, cheesin'. I get approached by this little skeeser. She asked me if I'm the real G, cause I'm Gucci from head to feet. I said, yeah, I'm really is, cause I spit in your man's face. Like Cam did that kid on Killa Season. She said I'm feeling a bit of ego. Wait, am I talking wrong?. I said nah, I'm a walking Kanye/Beyonce song.. She said I'm mad at you, I said why?. She said why you never make songs for chicks as if it's hard to do?. I said I make songs for me, leave the studio. And go and fuck the bitch who belongs to makin' songs for you. She said I'm feelin' your whole swagger and flow, can we hook up?. I said, eh, you just used the word swagger so NO. (hook). VERSE THREE - Eminem. We been ridin' around in this hatchback 'till I'm fucking hunchback. Where the fuck's this party at slutbag cunt? Cut what act?. Think it's an act? Fuck that, I'm tryina' ...?....finest love shack. Or somewhere to fuck at, eh? Don't touch that. You fat dyke, I'm tryina hear some Bagpipes from Baghdad. Don't act like you don't like em', them accents. I rap tight, and I'mma torture 'till we find this place, yeah that's right. Thought it was just past this light, past Van Dyke. Better hit that map right, read them directions. Oh yeah you can't read, and you can't write. Told me that last night, she took my CD out the deck. Snapped in half like, Relapse sucked. I snapped, hit the gas like, blew through the light. Spun out, hit a patch of black ice. Forgot we had a trailer hitch to the back. We jackknifed, bitch flew out of the car. I laughed like, she deserved it. She didn't think I'd act like that in person. (Yo, Royce, Marshall just crashed right in front of the club!). VERSE FOUR - Royce. Tell him I'll be there in a minute, I'm tryina break up this cat fight. Between my mistress and my damn wife. Then a chick wanted a hug, but she was fat. So I gave her that and told her to scat. I'm not mean, I'm cute. On my way to the front door, taking the scenic route. To avoid this chick with a lace front. Lookin' like Venus and Serena's hooves. I'm jus' sayin', those chicks got horse asses, they been attractive. Hope when they see me they don't slap me with they tennis rackets. My mind drifted back to this shit. I seen my wife push her down, step over her body,. And smack the mistress. Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vishis. Then I step out and see my evil twin. He gives me an evil grin. He mugs the mistress, turns around and gives the misses hugs and kisses. Looks at me twisted, like Nickel ""watch this shit!"". He smacks the dentures outta the mouth of the fat bitch he rode with. Looks back to mention, ""Royce, it's good to be back to business"". (hook). . . Develdiii"
welcome 2 hell,"(Eminem). Yeah, told you we'd be back.. Welcome 2 Hell. VERSE ONE - Eminem. There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off. So cold I done froze my butt off. And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet. It's like squirting a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck off. Other words I didn't put a dent in a can compared. To the damage I've yet to do. Long as you still have feelings to hurt,. I'll be around as long as you let me get to you. Long as I got two balls to palm, I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm. Get scared little pissants, and see if I don't come along. And stop your farm. Thunder and lightning, rain, hail, sleet with a tornado's the kind of brainstorm I get. So when the wind starts blowing, shit, talking about goin' in?. Goin' insane's more like it!. Wizard of words when he he spits hazardous with it. like a disastrous blizzard so you better listen quick fast don't miss it. Yeah go ahead little prick bastard, diss it. So you better listen quick fast, don't miss it. Yeah, go ahead little prick,. like a disastrous blizzard so you better listen quick fast don't miss it. Yeah go ahead little prick bastard, diss it. But when you get hit with a sick ass explicit flow. Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes. Just know, that all he knows is this. It's better to kick ass than kiss it. dick dastardly of audacity mental capacity. unmatched it has to be stopped. But it can't be, but man I can't just keep doing them like that. Or no one will rap with me. Step one, you asked who is it?. VERSE TWO - Royce. Guess who just came through the blast, you bitches. With the ratchet, the book of Mathew, a book of matches. Lightning, I'm ? white linen. You about to have to admit it. They pass you the mic, asked you to spit it. You got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands. Sure they gonna laugh when you go the bathroom with it. Now with what would you come against us?. Better be something with a big foot pedagree. Easily these are the reasons that we need to be in your prayers. Each region breed some emcees that wanna be, which means they wanna breath our air. With these ideas, anybody thinkin' that the game don't need. The Bad Meets Evil machine?. That's like saying that bad boy piston team didn't need Isaiah. VERSE THREE - Eminem and Royce. (Eminem). Sip piss and bleed, this is a different breed of emcees, I swear. Better be aware, there's too much at stake,. And to find someone this raw on a beat is rare. You can kiss my ass and the shit stains on my underwear. That I don't even wear. (Royce). This gotta be no fair, this like hittin' the lottery, oh yeah. Who you know hotter? There gotta be no pair. Shotty that I got a lobotomy, your hair. Classic, smack it, smother it, read it and weep and perhaps. You'll have no rebuttalin'. In fact, you seein' me in this rap is like saying. Tila Tequila can sing like Jasmin Sullivan. (Eminem). Back to badge her skull again, push a bitch out the Aston until I get the fuck outta dodge. Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors, ? color books that ain't colored in. Second and third, fourth wind, gotta another win. Here they come again, none other than, Bad and Evil. Also known as Sadam and Osama Bin. It's been a long time, but I bet neither one of us. Have felt as sick as we do right now. And we only get iller with time,. Me and Nickel fucking shit up on the grounds. Tellin' us to pipe down, it's like talking to a meth head. (get it? pipe? meth head? oh hilarity!). Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection. Fightin' it while he's watching internet porn,. About to meet his death with an erection. My god, what I mean is, David Carrideine jacking his penis in front of his tripod. Choking his own neck, what part you don't get?. I'm saying I die hard!. (Royce). When you listen to my bars, nothin' but the F-I-R...E. Comin' out your iPod, we come up in a place. Chicks heads start spinning like motherfuckin' white walls. (Eminem + Royce). Got your mother suckin' my balls while we fuck each other, punch each other in the eyeballs. And I never say I'm sor...ry, the 5'9 and the Fire Marshall. We spit with an intensity to shut shit down in the industry. Two different entities, with a propensity to put these N-U-T-S. In your FUCKING MOUTH. Haha.. Welcome to the CD.. Develdiii"

It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther. They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship. Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish. Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous. Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying?. [Eminem]. FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!. It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!. SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought. To take a dump during a brain fart, chump. If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say. That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place. We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here. Yeah, human oddities, and odds with us, your squad's gotta be. Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze. Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know. Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are. So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre. Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull. Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you. And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint. You must be huffing, fuck a ball sack. If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman. You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy. Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage. Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye. [Hook: Eminem]. Must be outta your mind, you think you fucking with us. Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up, this game is over. [Joell Ortiz]. Puffin' loosies, watching ""I Love Lucy"" with Gary Busey. Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady. Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?. I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe. 'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me. Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fugazi. All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys. Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce. Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice. Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice. You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist. Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so mois. Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw. Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for. I write until my right arm veins sore. Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war. You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna file out. Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that eyeball. Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night. Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight. [Joe Budden].

There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor. It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga. And you going to need the best doctors, house nigga. Guard your jewels and avoid large tools. Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool. Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told. They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold. Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate. I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face. Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock. I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock. [Hook]. [Crooked I]. Take off, you invited inside of the mind of. A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer). I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders. I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama. You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article. But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles. (The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there. Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air. Stay fly like unlimited fare. You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares. I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from. You stepped on number two just to be number one. Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard. Bogart for arts, we go hard. You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West. I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart. [Yelawolf]. I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers. With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper. When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor. You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker. Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown. Popping the trunk, my pumper stay cocking the round. I shit logs and I piss river brown. Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile. And that's as close as I get to a pyramid. Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant. Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent. But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end. They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing. Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing. Call me a clown, but you love where the clown's hanging. And the freakshows at the county carnival, then you paying. Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark. Yelling ""Go Shady!"" Driving slower than an old lady. In an old '89, no piece if you pay me. Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes. I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately. Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies. They call me crazy cause I made it. Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately. You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce. You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice. That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys.

The back of my hand on your neck pressing your face against the sheets it's insane. You been changed, cause I'm out of this world, girl I got that new (?) fame. I'm at an all-time high with highness, I'm at an all-time fly with flyness. And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. [Verse 3]. Never meet a nigga Twitter-beefing, first beef and I shot your fans.

You hot like a thick outfit in Texas. Without your underwear under it. Suck my dick, we both gets to steppin to my logic. [Eminem]. My dick is as hard as a yardstick. What we gonna do? Ride around til we're carsick. Then I'm gonna put this shit in park. And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot. Out of the trailer park by the garbage. What you waiting on? Me to roll up?. The condoms are in the glove compartment, lets start it!. Think I'm joking? What, am I sitting here. Trying to make fake farts with my armpits?. Am I here to amuse you?. [Royce]. I'm in your pocket outside of a church. The other hand is at the bottom of your purse. You giving me head in a boxing stance. My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt. I'm not your man, we're sparring partners. There's 5 things you are in charge of, that's. Sucking a dick, sucking a dick, sucking a dick. Sucking a dick, sucking a dick. [Eminem]. If you ain't sucking a dick. Why you sitting there with puckered lips? That's collagen... Motherfucking bitch, what you mean how'd you. Get suckered into this you gonna jump into my truck. And then try to get truculent?. [Royce]. You should be suffering, you should be cooking. You should be buckling your seatbelt with oven mitts. [Eminem].

Leave the mic with two dents. Fresher than a whole mouth full of chewed mints. Givin' you rude hints. Cause if you're wack I'm gonna tell ya. I got the issue where they diss you in next month's Source I'm gonna mail ya. You're a failure. You're style's staler than a bowl of hardened rice. Scarred and sliced. I flunked kindergarten twice. But you ain't hard and nice. And you sure ain't servin' no bids. Sayin' you did is like seein' a damn virgin with kids. Creepin' like a phantom. Holdin' my dick like the +Player's Anthem+. Holdin' this microphone for ransom. Bitches ask me why do I talk nasty?. Grab an ass of every trashy whore that walks past me. My crew's on drugs, lookin' like zombies. Smokin' bomb trees. Racin' police and dodge ?. [Royce Da 5'9""]. Lock, cock and explode. Way beyond bitin' a nigga. Get hungry, disconnect my jaw and swallow you whole. I'm probably gonna blow. Go to hell holdin' a mill. Street smart, under educated, over skilled. I'm tight to the vest. You wanna rip me off? Then try. I fight to the death, who wanna piss me off, then die?. Curse niggas that try, I'm the first nigga to bust. You the second nigga to pull, and the first nigga to die. How dare you think that you gleam like the rest of my team. You a bitch, you like a chip off a berget in my ring. Stick to my words, so I don't threaten niggas no more. If I make you a promise, then it's safe to say that it's honest. My guns is tired from being fired. While yours sits on the shelf. I'm like a song concept in itself. Totin' my weapon, burnin' your vest. In '99, wack niggas learn from the best and hope to be second. Nigga. Kool Kid nigga. What? Royce 5'9"", Slim Shady, motherfucker. [Develdiii]"
lighters (feat. bruno mars),"[Bruno Mars:]. This one's for you and me, living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters. [Eminem:]. By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up. I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up. If I was you, I would duck,. or get struck like lightening. Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up,. point em' skyward uh. Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king?. This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking. Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me. I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music. There is or there ever will be, disagree. Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up. The only thing I ever gave's using no more excuses. Excuse me if my head is too big for this building. And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick. but you cocks are slick. Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around,. crock-o-shit. Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick,. you did the opposite. You stayed the same,. just cock back with this still cock you pricks. I love it when I tell em shove it. Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall said bust a leg. Muster cause he couldn't cut mustard mustered up nothing. Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz. Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it. Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head. Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?. Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off. Little hussy ass, cause f-ck it,. guess it doesn't matter now, does it. What difference it make?. What it take to get it through your thick skulls. As if this ain't some bullshit. People don't usually come back this way. From a place that was dark as I was in. Just to get to this place. Now let these words be like a switch blade. to a haters rib cage. And let it be known from this day forward. I wanna just say thanks. cause your hate is what gave me strength. So let em cause I came with 5'9' but I feel like I'm 6'8'. [Bruno Mars:].

[Royce Da 5'9"":]. By the time you hear this. I'll probably already be outtie. I advance like going from toting iron to going. From buying 4 or 5 of the homies to iron man outtie. My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin to blow it. And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute. To tell Shady I love him. the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic. Tell him how real he is or high I am. Or how I would kill for him for him to know it. I cried many tears, my daddy got a bad back. So it's only right that I right till he can march. Right into that post office and tell em to hang it up. Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years. I'll stop when I'm at the very top. You shitted on me on your way up. It's bout to be a scary drop. Cause what goes up must come down. You going down on something. you don't wanna see like a hairy box. Every hour, happy hour now. Life is wacky now. Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy. Now I'm just the cats meooww, ow. Classic cow, always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao. Ya'll are doomed. I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me. My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes. Cause now I'm in the Aston. I went from having my city locked up. To getting treated like ? Patrick. And now I'm fantastic. Compared to a weed high. And y'all niggas just gossiping like bitches on a radio and TV. See me, we fly. Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive. And how real is that. I remember signing my first deal and now. I'm the second best I can deal with that. Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag. [Bruno Mars:]. You and I know what it's like. To be kept down, forced to fight. But tonight we're alright. So hold up your light. Let it shine. Cause this one's for you and me. Living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. With my arms out wide I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters"

Life handed me lemons. I jump back into the public eye and squirted lemon juice in it. By now you just wish I?d fucking die but I electrify. Get electrocuted, executed by an executioner of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zooming by. Guess who, what?s happening guys?. They told me to shit, I fell off that pot. Hoped right back up on that crapper and I. Said ?fuck you? with a capital I. Look who?s back to antagonize. You don?t like it? You can eat shit, fuck off little faggot and die. You right back like a maggot on my dick grabbing at my shit. better get to the back of the line. You wanna get your shot at me what kinda crap is that. Battle, what kind of rapper would I be before I let another rapper think he?s hot. I?ll bury my face in his stinky twat and go alalalala. Go ahead, space is limited, ain?t even room in the back of my mind. That?s why I ain?t thinking about you, I don?t got time and I told you a thousand times. So how can I find the time to put an alkaline battery in royce's back and at the same time put juice in mine?. Goddamnit Slaughterhouse is signed. [Verse 2: Royce da 5'9""]. I?m a menace villain, my pen is sitting spilling, my livers killing. Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceiling. The niggas willing to give the listeners the sickest feeling. Like mixing some Benadryl and penicillin. Then I?m filling the clip with a written. Can you picture my pistol drilling?. A million women and children when I?m illing. But it isn?t real, it?s a rap. On the real, it?s a wrap. How could you possibly stop the Apocalypse. When I?m atomic bombing the populous. Shock the metropolis hostile as a kid. Popping the Glock at his moms and his pops. Then he hops in his drop with his iPod rocking the Slaughterish. Documentation and lyrics I write with confidence. Write like a columnist slash novelist. I?m in this game to demolish, establish my dominance. Over prominent rappers you popping shit till you opposite. I can spit ominous so spit politics now I?m Haile Selassie, Gandhi, and Pac of this hip hop genre, bitch. [Voice]. SlaughterHouse!. [Verse 3: Crooked I]. Lyrically I?m a cocaine Altoid. Ability to bring ? it?s a no brain bout boy. Physically I?m literally a cocaine cowboy. Wait wait, did I just go almost four bars. Without talking about my big dick?. The other day me and your thick bitch had a great day and we ate cake. And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost. Cause she couldn?t handle my shit, wait I sweared. Irony of Ryan is I am bipolar while I?m rhyming standing beside a big old white bear. Neither one of us fight fair, you are literally looking at Woody and Wesley in a movie. With a white boy ain?t got to jump no where cause I?m here. Nigga I?m on fire yeah and I?m every bitch?s dream. One, two I?m coming for you, I?m a big old nightmare. Nigga this the slaughter stepping up. I?ll pretty much slap your ass and tell you to shut the fuck up. After that I?ll slap your ass again and tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up. And that?s how you body a fucking beat. [Voice]. [Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]. I should be the one that goes slow. Get a stopwatch, clock my flow. Hit the button on top watch the drug drop. ? when I drop I go outer space. Like I?m like Darth Vader?s face. Placed in a molten shower. Say something and get them proper. Mama poppa pouring out vodka. Mama Mia, Em pass me the seeds. It?s ? Slaughterhouse ? better yet boy go home, better yet boy ?. Better jet boy, Mark Sanchez, Santanio Holmes. I?m not just any old homeboy. Sitting in a lab picking up a pad. I be spitting bad, I?mma get you mad with this gift I have. Lord duck sufferin succotash when the trigger blast I?mma put your beak on your fitted hat. Where the liquor at? Sip of yak. That bitchh and a vicious track ?. Sly Pro tools to boast Joe smooth I coast to the West like we?re tired of living at. New York here?s a piggyback ride to the motherland. Hold on brotherman, on the other hand get down. I?m gutter fam, gun butt you with the Eagle handle Cunningham. I don?t wanna talk, I just wanna beef. I don?t want a piece, I want it all baby boy. I don?t wanna eat, I wanna feast up ? rough piece of shit. You done weak, I?m the one, capiche?. [Voice]. SlaughterHouse!. [Verse 5: Joe Budden]. Insane what they call us. Ain?t married to the game but you probably shouldn?t have came to the altar. Every bar like propane for the sawed-off, using ? to forge you. Eminent Mr. Porter, slaughter my cinnamons emminent torture. All of you feminine marauders, that?s women at war. Men will assault you, time is a bastard symbol of ?. Kidnap your trembling daughter, at least a quarter. I?m administering supporters, got an aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah. Normally something?s wrong with me. Claiming a quantity of the porn I see on the pause to me. When I fix the game they?ll think s**t came with a warranty. How the fuck are they gonna stop ? born to be. Corner me, shit belong to me, two choices, you can get along with me. Or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy. Wait, all you missing is heels to be RuPaul. Ain?t nobody that?s real ever knew y?all. Second to none and I?m dealing with Marshall. This time I never come down, deal with the blue balls. You ain?t gotta fear me but you?ll respect me. N****s who never met me threaten me. Why don?t you let me come ? I got some machetes. Swinging spaghetti like it?s heavy ? deserve an ESPY. In a Chevy like Andretti, put the Dezzy where his chest be.

renegade,"[Verse 1: Royce]. It's several different levels to picking up shovels and dumping you. In ditches under sea level fronting you when I'm with this. Let me refreshing you niggas til you my position in this. Beef! Leave you under Venice, opposition finished. There it is, we invaded created a Pyramid. Of a Haven of names, so blame Dre, and that ear of his. So.. breathe, I'd rather reach for your neck. And I never heat you for respect, unless you greet me with less. I've got a skunk in my trunk, I'm lying. I've got a pump in my trunk, you're dying, how many lumps niggas want?. Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all. We too incredibly raw, for any artist that said he would draw. I stand firm, and it hurts to live it. You open that can of worms, I hope you ready for the dirt that's with it. Slap a ho, snatch a mic, being brought to y'all in black and in white. (It's the new) Joe Jackson and Ike, we renegades. [Verse 2: Eminem]. Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen. I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute. Cause see they call me a menace, and if the shoe fits I'll wear it. But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it. Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics. Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics. Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits. But there's a huge interference, they're saying you shouldn't hear it. Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit. Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish. But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America. As a motherfucking drug addict like you didn't experiment?. Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror. And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed. And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents. You fucking do-gooders too bad you couldn't do good at marriage. And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't. Think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo. Cause here we go, he's Royce, he's the King Of Detroit. And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a. [Hook]. Renegade! Never been afraid to say. What's on my mind at, any given time of day.

Hand him a pint of Limon and turn him loose. I'm tired of you new jacks, I'm tired of niggas that's like ""I'm 'bout to blow"". Unless you a bitch, we don't care if you bout do that. Move back, youngster, the Glock on speak. Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat. The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya. Or flash the clip, or give you the picture developing. Click clock, six shots blows through another door. And it gets hot, Hip-hop Quotable tug of war. Who did ya niggas beats you bitches, who made it work?. That shit was.. I got harder two-way alerts. Just when I thought my dog couldn't get any meaner. You talk about his daughter, you probably getting the nina. You talk about his momma, he won't even give ya the finger. (He's crazy) Deranged, not media eaters, we renegades. [Verse 4: Eminem]. See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare. Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here. To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me. As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist. But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste. We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is. Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?. Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today. See it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie. While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me. Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics. In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer. I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful. The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you. What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter. Making this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a muhfuckin'. [Hook]. . [Develdiii]"

Rhymin about it is the sweet part. You can't be street smart with a cheap heart. Five Nine, a street nigga with deep feelin (what?). I keep illin, my steez willin to keep killin (what?). Fuck rap, a lot of y'all all is just acts. Trust that - you rhyme all wack on rough tracks. Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at. Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at. And I'ma spit thunder (what?) stick to my guns. Niggaz is finished before they gimmicks, one-hit wonders. What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls. I'ma pit bull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw (what?). Split y'all, holla, ""It's on!"" Then I diss y'all. All of y'all niggaz get pissed on claimin you pissed off. Chorus: Eminem and Royce (repeat 2X). Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?. Rappers comin in with they team and carry toolies. You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me. We hard-hittin, directin and starrin in it. [Eminem]. The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon. Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin. Any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes. so fast it'll look like an invisible man standin. I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail. Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale. Cause any MC that chooses to go against me. is gettin takin advantage of like Monica Lewinksy (Leave me alone!). Came home in a frenzy, pushin a ten speed. Screamin to Aunt Peg (AUNT PEG!!!!). with three spokes stickin out of my pant leg. Fuck a headache, give me a migraine. Damnit I like pain (AHH!). and you should be anywhere that I might gain. You rap knowin you wack. You act up and I'm throwin you down a flight of steps. then I'm throwin you back up em. If they don't like the track, fuck em. The rap struck em harder then gettin hit by a Mack truck. and then backed up on. And any half-assed known rapper to trespass. better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch (Ding! Ding!). So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly (Hurry up man!). I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie. I'm free-fallin feet first out of a damn tree. to stampede your chest till you can't breathe. And when I'm down to my last breath. I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step. and still laugh half bent. Chorus. [Em] Bad.. the bad... [R5] Uhh, when the bad meets the bad.. yo... [Em] The evil. [R5] Take the evil with the evil. [Em] Put em together. [R5] What? Nine-nine. [Em] Two times.. Slim Shady.. Royce the Five Nine"
session one (ft. slaughterhouse),"[Eminem]. Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin I'm back. I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks. Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black. Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac. Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturing. Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurring. Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurring. Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in. Trouble! What's occurring befo', after, and during the show. Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa. What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'. So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow. Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho. It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh. Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood. You should pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood. It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both. Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf. Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?. Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me?. I'm Kanye when he crashed. In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas. Destroyed the front end. Deployed the damn airbags from the dash. Went through 'em and laughed. Came back an hour after the accident. And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!. So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass. Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap. And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?. Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?. [Royce Da 5'9""]. I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you. Lump on your head designed by a bar stool. Designed by a cartoon. Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall. The 9 tucked against the lining. I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down. Like y'all are a couple 69ing. It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!. {rapid gunfire} FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!. You're screaming, ""Fuck the world!"" with your middle finger up. While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud. My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder. Because I murdered her, so you can call me. Nickel to O.J. to Glove. I got a Posse of Insane Clowns. Blow your brains on your opposite ear. And ask you how your brain sounds. Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann mad cerebral. You on your last burrito!. (What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating. Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern. Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touching that. Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the FUCK you at?. [Joell Ortiz]. I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years. Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare. Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares. I harbor the art of my nice wear. It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear. Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer. Homie chill, listen, I swear. I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears. I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?. Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's. Well, when you look at my pee. And this joint no exception, so just point a direction. And record the pig's oink when I rip his intestine. This isn't just an infection. This won't go away with penicillin injections. Millions of questions arose. After they did an inspection, what I exhibit. Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it. Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen. I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem. So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook. Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?. [Crooked I]. I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop. Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop. Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop. Get your mommy knocked. And your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped. I take your life to the ninth inning. A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning. I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny. I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money. Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches. Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala. I ball like Iguodala. I bear more arms than 6 koalas. As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah. Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun. I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn. I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con. A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!. Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying. We do it to try to do without tryin. (Slaughterhouse!) Cause to it's us it's so easy. Where's Jumpoff Joe Beezy?. [Develdiii]"

Go to Fifth Ave, just to shop for Shanell, huh. (She the one that ain't really got shit, huh. The little bitch that really ain't got tits, huh. Fuckin slut with a chest enhanced. Wouldn't dance if you ain't pay for her breasts implants). [Eminem]. Anybody with knives, we got knives too. More sharp, and ready to outslice you. About five dudes, waitin outside for you. And what's inside is coming outside you. Get me drunk, and I'll drink anything you can think. What's up Ms. Bitch? (Yo, what's up with the ring, you married?). Shit, I'm still mingling, bitch. I just wanted this ring, this the only finger it fits. Wattup with you, you married? (Naw, I'm divorced). Of course you are, you little fuckin trailer park whore. (Trailer?

take from me,"You're going to be okay, kid. You're going to be okay. HOOK - Claret Jai. Is everything not enough?. What more can I give up?. Is there anyone that I can trust?. I give you my all and you still take from me. VERSE ONE - Royce. Always been the type of dude that'll feed my clique. I know that without the fans, I ain't shit. But y'all better read my lips. I don't spit raps this ill, for you to just hack and steal. And leak my shit, so peep my drift. I hope y'all don't think you're helping me out with that shit. That shit stressin' me out. Nickel nine is blowin' up. Christmas time, you should hang my album on top of your fireplace. Cause around that time, my stocking's goin' UP. Feels like a victory, bittersweet, cause the bigger I get?. The bigger the wedge, between the relationship of me and my bigger bro. Hear what I said?. Feels like the shit just switched on me. Everything I do for the nigga, and the nigga know. I would do anything for him, but the nigga refuse. To just quit straight shittin' on me. Keepin' your distance? Probably best if you don't wanna fuck with me. But you know me probably best, fuck pity. You want that? You know it's like .... chest. Tough titty, the problems, you gotta problem, you think I'm already set. So I'mma look down on you? Just be proud of me. You already got my respect. I ain't gonna say something I regret. So I'mma just STOP, chasing the pain. Let you deal with the fact we don't get along cause. I got a big face in the game. Sometimes I feel like fuck my life. I fuck with a few niggas that I know that if my chick was a Shady ho?. Niggas wouldn't think twice before they fuck my wife. Guess that's the difference in friends and associates. I done been broke, I done been through the motions. I don't pay no attention to birds. I use my scope to tend to the vultures. No one ever blows up ..?.. talk. I don't make money just to lone it to y'all. Tell a nigga that the new album is like ...?.... is like talking to a hole in the wall. ..?..these niggas expensive. If I need to loan you money every time I see you just to be your friend?. I don't need your friendship. (hook) - Claret Jai. Is everything not enough?. What more can I give up?. Is there anyone that I can trust?. I give you my all and you still take from me. And I give, and I give. And you take, and you take. And you just walk away without nothing to say. And I give you my all and you just take from me (ay ay) x2. VERSE TWO - Eminem. I live in a bubble, I struggle with the fame. Trouble as the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say. When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away. To people who don't even appreciate flows, motherfucker, I'm living today. Cause I break my back to give you my art, you steal my thoughts. It's like driving a spike through my heart. You might think it's not that big of a deal to steal from me. But music is all I got. Aside from my daughters, not trying to sound like a martyr. But it's getting harder than I thought. To not just go crazy, trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap. And I might not deserve it but I got to, did I not work for it?. Put it all in every record I rip for. When the .... But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb like many think. SO FUCK THEM. They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they say it was ill, right?. The way I kill mics? But the way I feel right now?. It just feels like I'm so done with this shit I might as well wipe. I have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute. Farewell I bid you, but before I go, my last gift to you. Ladies and gentleman, Slaughterhouse I give you!. (hook). Develdiii"
the reunion,"(Eminem). Ay, yo. This next song, is a true story. (Come here, bitch!). Cause some things in this universe, don't make sense. But somehow always seem to fuckin' work. VERSE ONE - Eminem. Driving down I-75, about to hop on 696. I look over, this fucking chick's tryina' fix her makeup, I'm like bitch?. You ain't a plastic surgeon, I advise ya to put up your visor. I'm getting kinda ticked, you're blocking my side mirror. She's like yeah? so? I'm like so?. You gon' need a stitch you keep actin' like that, ho. I look like your husband slut? That's a rhetorical question. You talk to me like you talk to him, I'll fuck you up. In fact, get in the backseat, like the rest of my dates. No bitch rides shotgun, what? Taxi?. Stop and pick you some Maxi Pads up?. Is that what you actually ask me?. (smack). Bitch reaches over and smacks me. And says I annoy the fuck outta her. Get in the fucking back, put on your slut powder. You slut, what? Shut the fuck up now, or get your feelings hurt. Worse than my last chick, when I accidentally butt dialed her. And she heard me spreading age rumors about her. Turn the radio up louder, make it thump. While I bump that Relapse CD, tryina' hit every bump. In that...till I snap back in that accent. Cause she kept asking me to stop callin' her CUNT. I SAID THAT CUNT. HOOK - Eminem. She said, Marshall you ain't really like that, oh oh oh. Your putting on a show, where's your mic at?. Cause you're breaking my heart, you're breaking my heart. x2. VERSE TWO - Royce. Uh, pull up to the club in a Porsche, not a Pinto. While Marshall's at a white trash party, I'm at drama central. I walk up in there looking at my phone on twitter tweetin'. I'm feelin' a bunch of bitches lookin' at a nigga, cheesin'. I get approached by this little skeeser. She asked me if I'm the real G, cause I'm Gucci from head to feet. I said, yeah, I'm really is, cause I spit in your man's face. Like Cam did that kid on Killa Season. She said I'm feeling a bit of ego. Wait, am I talking wrong?. I said nah, I'm a walking Kanye/Beyonce song.. She said I'm mad at you, I said why?. She said why you never make songs for chicks as if it's hard to do?. I said I make songs for me, leave the studio. And go and fuck the bitch who belongs to makin' songs for you. She said I'm feelin' your whole swagger and flow, can we hook up?. I said, eh, you just used the word swagger so NO. (hook). VERSE THREE - Eminem. We been ridin' around in this hatchback 'till I'm fucking hunchback. Where the fuck's this party at slutbag cunt? Cut what act?. Think it's an act? Fuck that, I'm tryina' ...?....finest love shack. Or somewhere to fuck at, eh? Don't touch that. You fat dyke, I'm tryina hear some Bagpipes from Baghdad. Don't act like you don't like em', them accents. I rap tight, and I'mma torture 'till we find this place, yeah that's right. Thought it was just past this light, past Van Dyke. Better hit that map right, read them directions. Oh yeah you can't read, and you can't write. Told me that last night, she took my CD out the deck. Snapped in half like, Relapse sucked. I snapped, hit the gas like, blew through the light. Spun out, hit a patch of black ice. Forgot we had a trailer hitch to the back. We jackknifed, bitch flew out of the car. I laughed like, she deserved it. She didn't think I'd act like that in person. (Yo, Royce, Marshall just crashed right in front of the club!). VERSE FOUR - Royce. Tell him I'll be there in a minute, I'm tryina break up this cat fight. Between my mistress and my damn wife. Then a chick wanted a hug, but she was fat. So I gave her that and told her to scat. I'm not mean, I'm cute. On my way to the front door, taking the scenic route. To avoid this chick with a lace front. Lookin' like Venus and Serena's hooves. I'm jus' sayin', those chicks got horse asses, they been attractive. Hope when they see me they don't slap me with they tennis rackets. My mind drifted back to this shit. I seen my wife push her down, step over her body,. And smack the mistress. Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vishis. Then I step out and see my evil twin. He gives me an evil grin. He mugs the mistress, turns around and gives the misses hugs and kisses. Looks at me twisted, like Nickel ""watch this shit!"". He smacks the dentures outta the mouth of the fat bitch he rode with. Looks back to mention, ""Royce, it's good to be back to business"".

vegas (feat. eminem),"[Chainsaw revving]. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. [Eminem]. Got a shit-eatin' grin. Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again. We're in Sin City. Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope. Diggity, bitch, you need to run. And go get your frigity-friends. I'm lookin' at your bum-stickity-bum, hun. The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack. You can get the fickity-finger; the middle. You little dizzy bitch, sit and spig-a-tee-spin. Got a 6 o'clock cravin', stop, get Ciroc. It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night. I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in. Hit the spot, spot my next victim. I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'. Came to sip vodka, shit. Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies. I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear. But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha). What are you: pit, rott, mixed?. Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then let's lip-lock. If not, then chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose. You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat. Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog. Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit. Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'. My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots. Like this shit's hoppin'. And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'. So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B. I. G. , Pac. Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this. If not, then kick rocks in flip flops. And I produced the track. So you don't have to ask who it is. When this shit knocks (Turn up!). So bring clairvoyance to this bangin'. And I'm a keep on sayin'. All the shit I should be hung for. And probably killed for sayin'. And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again. Like choppin' 'til I'm droppin'. Still if that don't do the job of killin' Shady. Then the karma will. They sayin' I must bring it as Mohammad. Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain. And made me Robin Williams crazy. Or I end up with dementia, but you rockin' with a sadist. Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertainin'. I ain't stoppin' till we sprayed it. Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shakin'. But before I tie a rope around this nob. If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until. Wait, I just forgot what I was thinkin'. What's it called again? I'm blankin'. The thing above the balls between my legs. And I think I can feel it dangling. It's throbbing and it's veiny. Wait, I think I got it, okay, bitch I got you. Robin Williams hangin'. Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me. Come on kemosabe. It's past time, like your favorite hobby. Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick. Then she grab me by the nuts. And tried to take my sausage as a hostage. Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer. Or should I say Cobainer?. That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit. Gotta wean her off it, weiner off it. Like she took my fucking penis, chopped it. And stuck it up between her armpits. And she begun to swing a crumpet knife. And paint the carpet, at least. That's what her train of thought is. Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it, quit it. And made up a plate of bonkers. And I always end up giving these bitches some complex. And I don't mean apartment. So spread your feet apart. And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits. Now grab this Cuisinart. And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite. And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch. Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?). Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?. I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick. Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks. To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick. Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit. Took an unexpected twist. Like the neck of the freaking exorcist. Cha-cha-cha. Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey. Hate Versace, Versace, I got M√ºnchhausen by proxy. I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me. You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy. I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre. Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car. And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit. And I think with my dick so come blow my mind. And it tastes like humble pie. So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride. If I let you run alongside the Humvee. Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski. So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy. You gon' blow that rape whistle on me. (Squee!) I love it. 'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off. Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway. And try not to get lost. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas.

Whatever happens here, stays here. So let's go all the way dear. Til we get to Las Vegas. [Royce da 5'9]. Whatever happens in my room. It stays in my room like movie night like cable. Treat every women in my stable like flavors. Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days. In 7 nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas. We roll in circles and packs, we the lifesavers. She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then. I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib waving. And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor. I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors. And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it. Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry store. With a about a million dollars with your mama. And sat down did an ALS challenge, haan. I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again. About to get my back tatted again. About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand. Sitting on a bike in the sand. If you ain't been through nothing. Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you. Like likes on the Gram. If she current I keep her pussy. Purring like the pipes on a Lamb. Weed got her so chinky eyed. Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan. I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking. Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can. Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss. If this is my passion. I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence. The gift of my absence. I don't know who you been listening to. Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop. Bitch, I don't give a two shits. Bitch, get the fuck out of my face. To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there. And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum. Even though I have an affinity for a witty banter. Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer. Hold up, she misunderstood me. I said saint, por favor. Thought I said the Wraith had four doors. I knock a nigga face off. Give him the bottom of the nine. Like a baseball scoreboard (whatever...). I leave the club with my tab still open. Won't even get a cab for you and your friend. The only fear I have is of loathing. And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas. [Eminem]. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. Whatever happens here, stays here. So let's go all the way dear. Til we get to Las Vegas"
welcome 2 hell,"(Eminem). Yeah, told you we'd be back.. Welcome 2 Hell. VERSE ONE - Eminem. There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off. So cold I done froze my butt off. And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet. It's like squirting a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck off. Other words I didn't put a dent in a can compared. To the damage I've yet to do. Long as you still have feelings to hurt,. I'll be around as long as you let me get to you. Long as I got two balls to palm, I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm. Get scared little pissants, and see if I don't come along. And stop your farm. Thunder and lightning, rain, hail, sleet with a tornado's the kind of brainstorm I get. So when the wind starts blowing, shit, talking about goin' in?. Goin' insane's more like it!. Wizard of words when he he spits hazardous with it. like a disastrous blizzard so you better listen quick fast don't miss it. Yeah go ahead little prick bastard, diss it. So you better listen quick fast, don't miss it. Yeah, go ahead little prick,. like a disastrous blizzard so you better listen quick fast don't miss it. Yeah go ahead little prick bastard, diss it. But when you get hit with a sick ass explicit flow. Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes. Just know, that all he knows is this. It's better to kick ass than kiss it. dick dastardly of audacity mental capacity. unmatched it has to be stopped. But it can't be, but man I can't just keep doing them like that. Or no one will rap with me. Step one, you asked who is it?. VERSE TWO - Royce. Guess who just came through the blast, you bitches. With the ratchet, the book of Mathew, a book of matches. Lightning, I'm ? white linen. You about to have to admit it. They pass you the mic, asked you to spit it. You got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands. Sure they gonna laugh when you go the bathroom with it. Now with what would you come against us?. Better be something with a big foot pedagree. Easily these are the reasons that we need to be in your prayers. Each region breed some emcees that wanna be, which means they wanna breath our air. With these ideas, anybody thinkin' that the game don't need. The Bad Meets Evil machine?. That's like saying that bad boy piston team didn't need Isaiah. VERSE THREE - Eminem and Royce. (Eminem). Sip piss and bleed, this is a different breed of emcees, I swear. Better be aware, there's too much at stake,. And to find someone this raw on a beat is rare. You can kiss my ass and the shit stains on my underwear. That I don't even wear. (Royce). This gotta be no fair, this like hittin' the lottery, oh yeah. Who you know hotter? There gotta be no pair. Shotty that I got a lobotomy, your hair. Classic, smack it, smother it, read it and weep and perhaps. You'll have no rebuttalin'. In fact, you seein' me in this rap is like saying. Tila Tequila can sing like Jasmin Sullivan. (Eminem). Back to badge her skull again, push a bitch out the Aston until I get the fuck outta dodge. Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors, ? color books that ain't colored in. Second and third, fourth wind, gotta another win. Here they come again, none other than, Bad and Evil. Also known as Sadam and Osama Bin. It's been a long time, but I bet neither one of us. Have felt as sick as we do right now. And we only get iller with time,. Me and Nickel fucking shit up on the grounds. Tellin' us to pipe down, it's like talking to a meth head. (get it? pipe? meth head? oh hilarity!). Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection. Fightin' it while he's watching internet porn,. About to meet his death with an erection. My god, what I mean is, David Carrideine jacking his penis in front of his tripod. Choking his own neck, what part you don't get?. I'm saying I die hard!. (Royce). When you listen to my bars, nothin' but the F-I-R...E. Comin' out your iPod, we come up in a place. Chicks heads start spinning like motherfuckin' white walls. (Eminem + Royce). Got your mother suckin' my balls while we fuck each other, punch each other in the eyeballs. And I never say I'm sor...ry, the 5'9 and the Fire Marshall. We spit with an intensity to shut shit down in the industry. Two different entities, with a propensity to put these N-U-T-S. In your FUCKING MOUTH. Haha.. Welcome to the CD.. Develdiii"
"what the beat (ft. dj clue, method man)","[Method Man]. Niggas is like ""Oh my God not you!"". Yes I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest. No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed. With sex, drugs and rock and roll, new Tecs and calicos. Word has it we move mathematic on rappers. Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up. 8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method. Straight guerrilla iller nigga kill a murder record. My verbal shooter does it to ya. The 16-bar Ruger, busting yo funky dope maneuvers. But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm. Splash it on your skin rub it in like it's Lubriderm. 10 out of 10 I'll be the, men of all men I mean the. Creme de la creme a schemer, sipping on 'Gnac and Zima. True Professional 2 (DJ Clue!). Now that Bush is president nigga we all through. [Eminem]. It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder. Why I keep on ducking under the bed when I hear thunder. Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people. To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me. And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby. I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me. Believe me, there'll be just as many mutherfucking murderers. And heroin users without Marilyn's music. But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it. To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it. Now the parents are suing cause little Darren is screwing. Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit. Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up. Cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up. My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point. Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point. Now everybody's killing everybody and everybody's bloody. And I'm just laughing like it's funny. Cause I don't really give a shit about no-motherfucking-body. I'm so motherfucking nutty, I don't give a fuck about nothing. [Royce]. My wrist is water and freeze mix, this is. Audio Jesus the repent shit gets big. Keep it sharp like knife in a pop device. So ""Duro you gotta let it bump!"", I came from a hard knock life. They say this kid be rude like this can't be true. I'll suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed. Vampire, sun go down, I'm still wilding. Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins. Rock City baby, knife through your throat 'til you're broke. Rise from the underground like sewer smoke. It's all shifty, I got all of my dogs with me. And they all rich, and still all of their palms itchy. We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge. Walking like we talking drunk while we stumble over words. Clue, Duro, Slim, Meth, Five, Nine, hold up, breath. [Method Man]. It's just, Mr. Meth and DJ Clue. I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do. [Eminem]. It's just, Slim Shady and DJ Clue. I ain't evil, I just do what the beats say do. [Royce]. Uhh, uhh, Royce Five-Nine and DJ Clue. I ain't bad, I just do what the beats say do. [DJ Clue]. DJ Clue, Desert Storm. Come on man. [Develdiii]"
writer's block,"[Verse 1]. I ain't callin' names cause all of y'all the same. Plus I'm the king, all my past pain all done changed up. All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughter's came up. Cause they know their hands tied, feet ball and chained up. Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent because of my relationship. With Marshall used to make me a little partial, but here's the brain fuck. We the same, cause I'm probably 'bout to fall out with a young buck. While I attempt to fuck the fuckin' game up. Bitch, splat, only thing I fear in here is chit-chat. You are hearin' bars like your ear against a Kit Kat. Shady guys like the Navy, try us, wavey bye-bye. Maybe my Glock can turn your top to Baby's Maybach. My shit is parvo, literally sick, trust me, nigga, it's ugly to kill the thing. If the bigger I get the more disgustin' and fuckin' disfigured it gets. Niggas just want me to go pop, oh, stop. Y'all about the champagne, I'm about the toast. I, only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca. Niggas that'll smoke you while you starin' in your postbox. Only incense he enlightens when he's thinkin'. While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen. I'm back, mothafucka, notice the flyness on the cover of the XXL. I'm back from the dead like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers. How y'all realer? If I said it, I did it. If I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a car dealer. Give up the throne, your lease up, I am the Mona Lisa. That decoded Da Vinci Code, you throwin' your piece up. Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup. Making the mistake was like my only teacher. Wait 'til they get a load of me cause. [Hook: Royce and Eminem]. I've got Guccis on my feet, diamonds on my neck. Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick, but y'all already said that. Choppers in the trunk, models in the front. Bottles in the club, but I don't give a fuck, but y'all already said that. Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard. For me to come up with shit to say, ay. I'm at a loss for words cause y'all already said it all. I think I'm runnin' outta cliches, I'm gettin' writers block, psyche!. [Verse 2]. When I stand up in this booth, niggas notice it. Sittin' on the same boat that Noah built. Floatin' on the same water Moses split. Poetry in motion, but we sittin' on your grave site, overkill. Aren't you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet. Real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin' a new hybrid. You dudes is too excited. You a dude that'd try to sue a dude that's suicidal. You will just be another victim, I am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie. I'm a little twisted, I roll like the end credits in movies,. y'all just got scripted. Got y'all niggas' bitches bobbin' to this one. when she wit ya when she wit me. She bobbin', not vibin' tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper. I'm a serpent with a purpose, havin' problems? Not a problem. I've encountered, I have found elephants, lions, clowns. Will jump through hoops like they workin' for the circus. If the fire round the circle's right in front of them, fire rounds. Pun intended, gun extended, what are you marks askin'?. Car's Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it. Since I decided to start class this, all black, all glass. Panoramic roof been gettin' marked absent. I authorize my own all-access. Your bitch a whore, I'm a catch, she ball-catchin'. Her jaw's been broadcasted all across the globe from the store to Japan. Her pussy need to blocked and reported as spam. Interscope I been this dope, now sell it, my voicemail is full. Got bitches screamin' inside of envelopes and they tryna mail ?em to me. Tryna reach my phone, I don't know which one is harder. Tryna not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own. [Hook]. [Outro]. Man, get the bozac, we need to start bringin' that shit back (Mad flava!). Man, fuck it, I'm 'bout to catch some wreck (We in effect, money!). Mad props to Royce for keepin' it real on the strength. No diggity, I'm 'bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on. Haters, get the gas face!. [Develdiii]"
