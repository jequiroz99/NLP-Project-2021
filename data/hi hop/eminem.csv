rap god,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you. And not to hurt your feelings. But I'm only going to get this one chance. Something's wrong, I can feel it. Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen. But I don't know what. If that means, what I think it means. We're in trouble, big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say. I'm not taking any chances. You were just what the doctor ordered. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks their arms. Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?. They said I rap like a robot. So call me Rapbot. But for me to rap like a computer. Must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen'll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a living and a killing off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack. I'm an Mc still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with). This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop. You don't really wanna get into a pissing match. With this rappidy rap. Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac. Pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac. And at the exact same time. I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts. While I'm practicing that. I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic. I was under Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow?. All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are having a rough time period. Here's a maxipad. It's actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks their arms. Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?. Let me show you maintaining. This shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key. And the secret to rap immortality like I have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage. And youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the moon since. Mc's get taken to school with this music. Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme. Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2pac N. W. A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy. Thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up. Blow up and be in a position. To meet Run Dmc and induct them. Into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I walk in the church. And burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it's all a game. 'Til I walk a flock of flames. Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?. Little gay looking boy. So gay I can barely say it. With a straight face looking boy. You witnessing a massacre. Like you watching a church gathering. Take place looking boy. Oy vey, that boy's gay. That's all they say looking boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a way to go from your label everyday. Looking boy. Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?. I got a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy. I'mma work for everything I have. Never ask nobody for shit. Get outta my face looking boy. Basically boy you're never gonna be capable. To keep up with the same pace looking boy. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I'm racing around the track. Call me Nascar, Nascar. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park. The White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton. No Asgard, Asgard. So you be Thor and I'll be Odin. You rodent, I'm omnipotent. Let off then I'm reloading immediately. With these bombs I'm totin'. And I should not be woken. I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head. A zombie floating. But I got your mom deep throating. I'm out my ramen noodle. We have nothing in common, poodle. I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm. And pay homage, pupil. It's me, my honesty's brutal. But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere. In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle. Enough rhymes to maybe to try. And help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case. 'Cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry looking at me. Like it's lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big. And here they come trying to censor you. Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"". From the Marshall Mathers Lp. One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine. Put 'em all in a line, add an Ak-47, a revolver and a nine. See if I get away with it now. That I ain't as big as I was. But I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal. You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though. And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows. You're like normal, fuck being normal. And I just bought a new Raygun from the future. To just come and shoot ya like. When Fabolous made Ray J mad. Cause Fab said he looked like a fag. At Maywhether's pad. Singin' to a man while they played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24 7 special. On the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day. ''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''. Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed. (Jj Fad). Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa. You assuming I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you. I'm superhuman. Innovative and I'm made of rubber. So that anything you saying. Ricocheting off of me. And it'll glue to you. I'm never stating. More than never demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience. A feeling like it's levitating. Never fading. And I know that the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off. They'd be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. Oh, he's too mainstream. Well, that's what they do. When they get jealous, they confuse it. It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it. I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use. Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm ripping any one of these verses. Diverse as you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to prove. That if you're half as nice at songs. You can sacrifice virgins too. School flunkie, pill junky. But look at the accolades the skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself cause I make me do. What I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues. But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel. I'm asleep in the front seat. Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still ""Chunky, But Funky"". But in my head there's something. I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils. Here's what they want from me. They asking me to eliminate. Some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration. The bitter hatred that I had. Then you may be a little patient. And more symphatetic to the situation. And understand the discrimation. But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then. But if I can't batter the women how the fuck. Am I supposed to bake them a cake then?. Don't mistake it for Satan. It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas. And take a vacation to trip a broad. And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard. Be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God?"
lose yourself,"Look, if you had one shot. Or one opportunity. To seize everything you ever wanted. One moment. Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo. His palms are sweaty. Knees weak, arms are heavy. There's vomit on his sweater already. Mom's spaghetti, he's nervous. But on the surface he looks calm. And ready to drop bombs. But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down. The whole crowd goes so loud. He opens his mouth but the words won't come out. He's choking, how?. Everybody's jokin' now. The clock's run out, time's up, over Blow!. Snap back to reality. Oh there goes gravity. Oh there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad. But he won't, give up that easy, no. He won't have it. He knows his whole back's to these ropes. It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that. But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows. When he goes back to this mobile home. That's when it's back to the lab again, yo. This whole rhapsody. He better go capture this moment. And hope it don't pass him. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better. Soul's escapin'. Through this hole that is gaping. This world is mine for the taking. Make me king. As we move toward a new world order. A normal life is boring. But superstardom's close to post mortem. It only grows harder. Homie grows hotter. He blows us all over. These hoes is all on him. Coast to coast shows. He's known as the Globetrotter. Lonely roads. God only knows. He's grown farther from home, he's no father. He goes home and barely knows his own daughter. But hold ya nose. 'Cause here goes the cold water. These hoes don't want him no mo'. He's cold product. And they moved on to the next schmoe who flows. And he knows dove and sold nada. And so the soap opera is told and unfolds. I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on. Da da dum da dum da da. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go, oh. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go, oh. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better. No more games. I'ma change what you call rage. Tear this muthafuckin' roof off. Like two dogs caged. I was playin' in the beginnin'. The mood all changed. I've been chewed up and spit out. And booed off stage. But I kept rhymin'. And stepwritin' the next cipher. Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper. All the pain inside amplified by the. Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five. And I can't provide the right type of. Life for my family 'cause man. These Goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers. And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer. This is my life and these times are so hard. And it's gettin' even harder. Tryin' to feed and water my seed. Plus teeter-totter. Caught up between bein' a father and a primadonna. Baby momma drama, screamin' on her. Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot. Another day of monotony. Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail. I've got to formulate a plot. 'Fore end up in jail or shot. Success is my only muthafuckin' option. Failure's not. Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go. I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot. So here I go, it's my shot. Feet fail me not. 'Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got. You better. Lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go, oh. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go, oh. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better. You can do anything if you set your mind to man"

mockingbird,"Yeah. I know sometimes,. things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd daddy always tell you?. Straighten up little soldier. Stiffen up that upper lip. What you crying about?. You got me. Hailie, I know you miss your mom,. and I know you miss your dad. Well, I'm gone,. But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had. I can see you're sad, even when you smile,. even when you laugh. I can see it in your eyes,. deep inside you wanna cry. 'cause you're scared, I ain't there?. Daddy's with you in your prayers. No more crying, wipe them tears. Daddy's here, no more nightmares. We gon' pull together through it,. we gon' do it. Laney, uncle's crazy, ain't he?. Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it. We're all we got in this world. When it spins, when it swirls,. when it whirls, when it twirls. Two little beautiful girls. Lookin' puzzled, in a daze. I know it's confusing you. Daddy's always on the move,. mamma's always on the news. I try to keep you sheltered from it. but somehow it seems. the harder that I try to do that,. the more it backfires on me. All the things growing up his daddy. that he had to see. Daddy don't want you to see. but you see just as much as he did. We did not plan it to be this way,. your mother and me. But things have got so bad between us. I don't see us ever being together ever again. Like we used to be when we was teenagers. But then of course everything always happens for a reason. I guess it was never meant to be. But it's just something we have no control. over and that's what destiny is. But no more worries,. rest your head and go to sleep. Maybe one day we'll wake up. and this will all just be a dream. Chorus. Now hush little baby, don't you cry. Everything's gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya. Daddy's here to hold ya through the night. I know mommy's not here right now and. we don't know why. We fear how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby. But I promise, momma's gon' be alright. It's funny. I remember back one year. when daddy had no money. Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up. and stuck 'em under the tree. and said some of 'em were from me. 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em. I'll never forget that Christmas. I sat up the whole night crying. 'cause daddy felt like a bum,. see daddy had a job. But his job was to keep the food. on the table for you and mom. And at the time, every house that we lived in. either kept getting broke into and robbed. or shot up on the block and your mom. was saving money. for you in a jar. Tryna start a piggy bank for you. so you could go to college. Almost had a thousand dollars,. till someone broke in and stole it. And I know it hurt so bad. it broke your momma's heart. And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart. Mom and dad was arguin' a lot. so momma moved back. on the Chalmers in the flat,. one bedroom apartment. And dad moved back to the other side. of 8 Mile on Novara. And that's when daddy went to California with his Cd. and met Dr. Dre. And flew you and momma out to see me. But daddy had to work,. you and momma had to leave me. Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V.,. and momma didn't like it. And you and Laney were too young to understand it. Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit. And it all happened too fast. for either one of us to grab it. I'm just sorry you were there and. had to witness it first hand. 'cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud. Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscing. Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out. to see how much you both have grown,. it's almost like you're sisters now. Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here. Laney I'm talkin' to you too,. daddy's still here. I like the sound of that, yeah. It's got a ring to it don't it?. Shh, momma's only gone for the moment. Chorus. Now hush little baby, don't you cry. Everything's gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya. Daddy's here to hold ya through the night. I know mommy's not here right now and. we don't know why. We fear how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby. But I promise, momma's gon' be alright. And if you ask me too. Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird. I'ma give you the world. I'ma buy a diamond ring for you. I'ma sing for you. I'll do anything for you to see you smile. And if that mockingbird don't sing. and that ring don't shine. I'ma break that bird's neck. I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya. And make him eat every carat. Don't fuck with dad (haha)"
not afraid,"(Chorus). I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let me know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road. Yeah, It's been a ride.... I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one. Now some of you might still be in that place. If you're trying to get out, just follow me. I'll get you there. You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper. Before I lay em. But you won't take this thing out these words. before I say em. Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me. from causing mayhem. When I say em or do something. I do it, I don't give a damn. What you think?. I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world. Feed it beans, it's gassed up,. If a thing's stopping me. I'mma be what I set out to be,. Without a doubt undoubtedly. And all those who look down on me. I'm tearing down your balcony. No if ands or buts. Don't try to ask him why or how can he. From Infinite down to the last. Relapse album he's still shit and. Whether he's on salary, paid hourly. Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him. Whichever comes first, for better or worse. He's married to the game,. Like a fuck you for christmas. His gift is a curse,. Forget the earth he's got the urge. To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe. (Chorus). I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let me know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road. Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit,. And cut the crap. I shouldn't have to rhyme these words. In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap. You said you was king, you lied through your teeth. For that fuck your feelings,. Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped. And to the fans, I'll never let you down again,. I'm back. I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact. Let's be honest, that last Relapse Cd was ""ehhhh"". Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground. Relax, I ain't going back to that now. All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack Blaow. Cause I ain't playin' around. There's a game called circle and I don't know how. I'm way too up to back down. But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out. Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't. This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around. But it's time to exorcise these demons. These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!. (Chorus). I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let me know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road. And I just can't keep living this way. So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage. I'm standing up, Imma face my demons. I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground. I've had enough, now I'm so fed up. Time to put my life back together right now. It was my decision to keep it clean, I did it for me. Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you. So I could come back a brand new me,. You helped see me through. And don't even realise what you did,. Believe me you. I been through the ringer,. But they can do little to the middle finger. I think I got a tear in my eye,. I feel like the king of... My world, haters can make. Like bees with no stingers, and drop dead. No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on,. I promise. To focus soley on handling my responsibility's. As a father. So I solemnly swear to. Always treat this roof like my. Daughters and raise it. You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely. Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club. Or a corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up. Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon. But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not. (Chorus). I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let me know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"
love the way you lie (feat. rihanna),"(Rihanna). Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. That's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. That's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). I can't tell you what it really is. I can only tell you what it feels like. And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe. I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight. As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in. flight. I offer love drunk from my hate. It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I. suffer. I suffocate. And right before I'm about to drown she. resuscitates me. She fucking hates me and I love it. Wait. Where you going. I'm leaving you. No you ain't. Come back. We're running right back. Here we go again it's so insane. Cause when it's going good it's going great. I'm Superman with the wind in his back. She's Lois Lane. But when it's bad it's awful. I feel so ashamed. I snap. Who's that dude?. I don't even know his name. I laid hands on him. I'll never stoop so low again. I guess I don't know my own strength. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. That's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). You ever love somebody so much. You can barely breathe. When you're with them. You meet. And neither one of you. Even know what hit them. Got that warm fuzzy feeling. Yeah them chills. Used to get them. Now you're getting fucking sick. Of looking at them. You swore you've never hit them. Never do nothing to hurt them. Now you're in each other's face. Spewing venom. And these words. When you spit them. You push. Pull each other's hair. Scratch, claw, pit them. Throw them down. Pin them. So lost in the moments. When you're in them. It's the craze that the corporate. Controls you both. So they say it's best. To go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know you. Cause today. That was yesterday. Yesterday is over. It's a different day. Sound like broken records. Playing over. But you promised her. Next time you'll show restraint. You don't get another chance. Life is no Nintendo game. But you lied again. Now you get to watch her leave. Out the window. Guess that's why they call it windowpane. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. That's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). Now I know we said things. Did things. That we didn't mean. And we fall back. Into the same patterns. Same routine. But your temper's just as bad. As mine is. You're the same as me. But when it comes to love. You're just as blinded. Baby please come back. It wasn't you. Baby it was me. Maybe our relationship. Isn't as crazy as it seems. Maybe that's what happens. When a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is. I love you too much. To walk away now. Come inside. Pick up your bags off the sidewalk. Don't you hear sincerity. In my voice when I talk. Told you this is my fault. Look me in the eyeball. Next time I'm pissed. I'll aim my fist. At the dry wall. Next time. There will be no next time. I apologize. Even though I know it's lies. I'm tired of the games. I just want her back. I know I'm a liar. If she ever tries to fucking leave again. I'mma tie her to the bed. And set this house on fire. Just gonna. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. That's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie"

when i'm gone,"Yeah. It's my life. My own words I guess. Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?. Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?. When they know they are your heart. And you know you are their armour. And you will destroy anyone who will try to harm her. But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you. And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you. What happens when you become the main source of her pain. ""Daddy look what I made?"". ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane"". ""Daddy where's mommy?. I can't find mommy, where is she?"". I don't know, go play, Hailie baby your daddy's busy.. Daddy's writin' this song, this song. ain't gon' write itself. I give you one underdog,. you gotta swing by yourself. Then turn right around in that song,. and tell her you love her. And put hands on her mother. who's a spittin' image of her. That's slim shady, yeah baby slim shady's crazy. Shady made me, but tonight,. Shady's rock-a-by baby. Refrão (2x):. And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn,. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing. so baby don't feel no pain,. just smile back. I keep havin' this dream -. I'm pushin' Hailie on the swings she keeps screamin'. She don't want me to sing,. ""You're makin mommy cry, why,. why's momy crying?"". Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more,. ""Daddy you're lying,. You always say that, you always say this is the last time,. but you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're mine!"". She's piling boxes infront of the door. tryin' to block it,. ""Daddy please daddy don't leave daddy no, stop it!"". Goes in her pocket,. pulls out a tiny necklace locket,. it's got a picture,. ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with you"". I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror,. these fuckin' walls must be talkin. coz man I can hear 'em. They sayin you got. one more chance to do right, and it's tonight,. Now go out there and show 'em that you love. 'em 'fore its too late. And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door. it turns to a stage,. they're gone. And the spotlight is on and I'm singin.... Refrão. And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn,. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing. so baby don't feel no pain,. just smile back. Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seat. The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet. I take a bow, ""and thank you all for comin' out"". They're screamin so loud,. I take one last look at the crowd. I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein',. ""Daddy it's me! Help mummy. her wrists are bleedin'"". But baby we're in Sweden,. how did you get to Sweden?!. ""I followed you daddy, you told me that you wern't leavin. You lied to me dad,. and now you make mommy sad. And I bought you this coin. It says 'number 1 dad', that's all I wanted. I just wanna give you this coin. I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin"". But baby wait-. ""its too late dad, you made your choice.. Now go out there and show 'em. that you love 'em more than us. That's what they want. They want you Marshall,. they keep screamin your name,. it's no wonder you can't go to sleep. Just take another pill, yeah I bet ya you will. You rap about it. Yeah word, ke-keep it real"". I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see. How could it be that the curtain is closing on me. I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it,. put it to my brain, scream 'Die Shady!' and pop it. The sky darkens, my life flashes,. The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes. and burns to ashes. That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin',. There's birds singin', it's spring and. Hailie's out side swingin'. I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her. Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister,. almost as if to say-. Refrão. And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn,. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing. so baby don't feel no pain,. just smile back"
till i collapse (feat. nate dogg),"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired,. Feel weak, and when you feel weak,. you feel like you wanna just give up.. But you gotta search within you,. you gotta find that inner strength. And just pull that shit out of you. and get that motivation to not give up. And not be a quitter,. no matter how bad. you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. [Eminem]. Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps. long as you feel 'em. Till the day that I drop you'll never say. that I'm not killing them. 'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em. And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem.. Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women. are caught in webs spin and hauk venom. Adrenaline shots of penicillin. could not get the illing to stop.. Amoxacilin is just not real enough.. The criminal cop killing hip-hop. filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.. Your coming with me, feel it or not. you're gonna fear it like I showed you. the spirit of god lives in us.. You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock. is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.. For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot. listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.. [Chorus - Natedogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. [Eminem]. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling. you get when you're real. And you spit and people are feeling your shit.. This is your moment and every single minute. you spend trying to hold onto it. 'Cause you may never get it again.. So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can. And when your run is over. just admit when it's at its end.. 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits. with half this shit that gets in.. I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.. It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie,. Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.. But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy,. so when I'm not put on this list. the shit does not offend me.. That's why you see me walk around. like nothing's bothering me.. Even though half you people. got a fucking problem with me.. You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me. The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney.. Nate hit me.. [Chorus - Natedogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. [Eminem]. Soon as a verse starts. I eat it at Mc's heart. What is he thinking?. How not to go against me? Smart.. And it's absurd how people hang on every word.. I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve. But I'll never be served. my spot is forever reserved. If I ever leave earth. that would be the death of me first.. 'Cause in my heart of hearts. I know nothing could ever be worse.. That's why I'm clever. when I put together every verse. My thoughts are sporadic,. I act like I'm an addict. I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers.. But I don't want to go forth and back. in constant battles. The fact is I would rather sit back. and bomb some rappers.. So this is like a full blown attack. I'm launching at them. The track is on some battling raps who want some static. 'Cause I don't really think. that the fact that I'm Slim matters. A plaque of platinum status is whack. if I'm not the baddest.. [Chorus - Natedogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. Until the roof. The roof comes off. Until my legs. Give out from underneath me. I will not fall,. I will stand tall,. Feels like no one could beat me."
stan (feat. dido),"My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I... Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window... And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'll all be gray,. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad... Dear slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin. I left my cell, my pager,. and my home phone at the Bottom.

So this is my cassette I'm sending you,. I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway. Hey slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?. You know the song by phil collins,. ""in the air of the night"". About that guy who coulda saved that other. Guy from drowning. But didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?. That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued. Me from drowning. Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now,. I'm drowsy. And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall. I love you slim, we coulda been together, think about it. You ruined it now, I hope you can't. Sleep and you dream about it. And when you dream. I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it. I hope your conscience eats at you and you. Can't breathe without me. See slim; [*screaming*] shut up bitch!. I'm tryin to talk!. Hey slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see. I ain't like you. Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more,. and then she'll die too. Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now. Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I... Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window... And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'll all be gray,. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad... Dear stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy. You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?. Look, I'm really flattered you would call your. Daughter that. And here's an autograph for your brother,. I wrote it on the starter cap. I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show,. I musta missed you. Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you. But what's this shit you said about you like to cut. Your wrists too?. I say that shit just clownin dogg,. C'mon - how fucked up is you?. You got some issues stan, I think you need. Some counseling. To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when. You get down some. And what's this shit about us meant to be together?. That type of shit'll make me not want us. To meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter,. I just hope it reaches you in time. before you hurt yourself,. I think that you'll be doin just fine. If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but stan. Why are you so mad?. Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy shit. I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that. Made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge. And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant. With his kid. And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say. Who it was to. Come to think about, his name was.. it was you. Damn!"
the real slim shady,"May I have your attention please. May I have your attention please. Will the real slim shady please stand up. I repeat will the real slim. shady please stand up. We're gonna have a problem here. Ya'll act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the floor. Like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door. And started whoopin her ass worse than before. They first were divorced. Throwing her over furniture (aah). It's the return of the. ""ah wait, no wait, you're kidding. He didn't just say what I think he did. Did he? "". And Dr. Dre said. Nothing you idiots, Dr Dre's dead. He's locked in my bassment. Feminist women love eminem. Chicka chicka chicka slim shady. ""I'm sick of him, look at him. Walkin around, grabbin his you know what. Flippin' to you know who"". ""yeah, but he's so cute though"". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's. goin on in your parents bedroom (eheheheh). Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose. But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green. to hump a dead moose. My bum is on your lips. My bum is on your lips. And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss. And that's the message that we deliver to little kids. And expect them not to know. what a woman's clitoris is. Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is. By the time they hit 4th grade. They got the discovery channel, dont they?. We ain't nothing but mammals. Well, some of us cannibals. Who cut other people open like cantelopes. But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes. Then there's no reason that a man. And another man can't elope. But if you feel like I feel. I got the antedote. Women wave your pantehose. Sing the chorus and it goes. I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up. Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up. Will Smith don't got to cuss in his raps to sell records. Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too. You think I give a damn about a grammy. Half of you critics can't even stomach me. Let alone stand me. ""but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird"". Why? so you guys can just lie to get me here. So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears. Bullshit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs. So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst. And hear em argue over who she gave head to first. Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV. ""yeah, he's cute. But I think he's married to Kim, hee hee"". I should download her audio on MP3. And show the world. how you gave eminem VD (aah). I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups. All you do is annoy me. So I have N'SYNC here to destroy you. And there's a million of us just like me. Who cuss like me. Who just don't give a fuck like me. Who dress like me, walk, talk. And act like me. And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me. I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up. Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up. I'm like a head trip to listen to. Cause I'm only giving you things. You joke about with your friends inside you livin' room. The only difference is I got the balls to say it. In front of ya'll and I aint gotta be false or sugar coated at all. I just get on the mic and spit it. And whether you like to admit it (riip). I just shitted it better than 90 you rappers out can. Then you wonder how can. Kids eat up these albums. Like valiums. It's funny, cause at the rate I'm going. When I'm thirty. I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting. Pinchin nurses asses. When I'm jackin off with jergen's. And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of viagra. Isn't working. In every single person there's a slim shady lurkin. He could be workin at burger king. Spittin on your onion rings. Or in the parking lot, circling, screamin. I dont give a fuck. With his windows down and his system up. So will the real shady please stand up. And put 1 of those fingers on each hand up. And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control. And 1 more time, loud as you can, how does it go?. I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up. Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up. Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up. Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up. Haha guess it's a slim shady in all of us. Fuck it let's all stand up"
cleanin' out my closet,"Where's my snare?. I have no snare on my headphones. There you go, yeah, yo yo. Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?. I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against. Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times. Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind. All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'. Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'. Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'. Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'. Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth. See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out. Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now. Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now. I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry. But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha"". I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it. So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it. I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73. Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD. I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months. My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch. 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye. No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die. I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side. Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her. At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes. But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today. What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb. But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun. 'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both. It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show. I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha"". Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition. Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'. But put yourself in my position, just try to envision. Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen. Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'. Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't. 'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?. Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?. So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?. But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely. And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony. And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral. See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong. Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom. But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get. You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit. Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?. Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!. I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"""
lucky you (feat. joyner lucas),"Woah. Joyner, Joyner. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I done did a lot of things in my day. I admit it, I don't take back what I say. If I said it, then I meant it. All my life I want a Grammy. But I'll prolly never get it. I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon. Fuck the system, I'm that nigga. Bend the law, cut the rules. I'm about to risk it all. I ain't got too much to lose. Y'all been eating long enough. It's my turn to cut the food. Pass the plate. Where my drink?. This my day. Lucky you. Fuck you too, woah!. Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move. y'all gotta move. Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice. Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?. Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move. give me the juice. Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall. Turn my back on you all and you're finished. Back to these bullets, it's back to the job. Put my MAC on and all of you runnin'. Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushing. These packs and I'm actually pumpin'. Can't fuck what you rapping, you practically suckin'. You might've went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'. I'm actually buzzin' this time. Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine. I do not fuck with you guys. If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time. I ain't no gangster but I got some banging. Some chains and some blades in, and a couple of knives. Choppers and jammies, a partridge in a pear tree. My twelve days of Christmas was nothing but lies. Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo). They say I talk like a chulo. I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno. Bitch, I'm a dog call me Cujo. You play your cards, I reverse on you all. And I might just drop four like an Uno. Cállate boca mejor, maricón, liltle puto, and all of you culo. They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto. lookin' for something that prolly can never find out. Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now. What you would nigga? You really want me tied down. I've been alone, I never needed nobody. Just only me and my shotty. I'll tell these niggas to lie down. Keep all of the money I never wanted the lifestyle. I just pray to God that my son be alright now. I said ain't no love for the other side. or anyone who ever want smoke. When I die I'm going out as the underdog. who never lost hope. You in the wrong cab down the wrong path. Nigga wrong way, wrong road. Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast. I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower. I have said a lotta things in my day. I admit it, this is payback in a way. I regret it that I did it. I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em. Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition. Fuck's the difference?. I'm that cracker!. Bend the law. Fuck the rules. Man I used to risk it all. Now I got too much to lose. I been eating long enough. Man my stomach should be full. I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet. Lucky me. Fuck you think? (woo!). I got a couple of mansions, still I don't have any manners. You got a couple of ghost writers. but to these kids it don't actually matter. They're asking me ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop? "". I said ""I don't have any answers"". 'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album. it hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers. And actually coming from humble beginnings. I'm somewhat of uncomfortable winning. I wish I could say ""what a wonderful feeling"". We're on the upswing. like we're punching the ceiling. But nothing is stealing, like anyone has any fucking ability. To even stick to a subject, it's killing me. the inability to pin humility. Hatata batata. ""Why don't we make a bunch of fuckin' songs about nothin'. And mumble"", and fuck it. I'm goin' for the jugular. Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up. Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck. About the ones that were here before you to make raps. it's recap. Way back, MC's that. Recap, and tape decks. Eight DATs with the G raps and. Kane's at, we need three stacks. ASAP, and bring lap Masta Ace back. Because half of these rappers have brain damage. All the lean rappin', face tats. syruped out like tree sap. I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad but in fact. With a old-me at the same cat that would take that. Feedback and aim back, I need that. But I think it's inevitable. They all got button to press. or a lever to pull. It gives me the snap though (little bitch). And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big. But you've been taking the dicks. On the fuckin' gag, hoe (get it?). On the brink in a minute. Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything. With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits. I'ma sleep at the wheel again. As I peak into thinking about an evil intent. Of another beat 'em and kill again. 'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again. Even ketamine or methamphetamine. With the Manidon, it better be at least 70 to 300mg. And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up being a villain again. Levels to this shit I got an elevator. You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker. I sound like a broken record every time I break a record. Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator. Motherfucker never got a right to be this way. I got spite inside my DNA. But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, aye. It's the moment y'all been waiting for. Like California wishin' rain'd pour. And that drought y'all have been praying for. My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw. Still the same Marshall that outlaw. That they say is a writer might've fell off. But back on that bull like the cowboys. So y'all gotta move (yeah). y'all gotta move (yeah). y'all gotta move. Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice. Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?. Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move. give me the juice"
the ringer,"Yeah, (Illa). Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts. see where this takes me. 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world. in the fuckin' face right now, yeah!. Let me explain just how to make greatness. Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down. Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout. To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows. If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brr). Full magazine could take Staples out. Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account. But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown. Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch. I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'. My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are. To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view. You mention me, millions of views. attention in news. I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you. Billions of views, your ten cents are two. Skim through the music to give shit reviews. To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse. Don't get misconstrued, business as us'. Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do. Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get. What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to. Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow. Everyone copies though? Probably no. Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adiós. I can see why people like Lil Yachty. but not me though. Not even dissin', it just ain't for me. All I am simply is just an MC. Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (get it). Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean. Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably. Shake the world up if it were up to me. Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill. I should eat a pill, probably I will. Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death. I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath. Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed. Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, spelled). Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick. With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip. Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench. While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch. Like vice-president Mike Pence. Back up on my shit in a sidekick. as I lay it on a spike strip. These are things that I'd rather do. than hear you on a mic. Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and. Jesus Christ, man, how many times is. Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!). You won't ever see Em icy. But as cold as I get on the M-I-C. I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze. And your skull might split. like I passed you upside it. Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah). Turn down for what?. I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up!. 'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut. Now when it doesn't matter what caliber. I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks. You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck. Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?. And now he wants to take it out on us. "" (oouu). But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy. Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study. It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me. I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that. I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry. Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing). So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'. Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne. I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name. I'm fed up with bein' humble. And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings. I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach. I heard your mumblin', but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo. The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to. What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?. I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two. And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner. If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner. I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it. I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper. You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's. But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse. you better go get Revival. But y'all are actin' like I tried. to serve you up a slider. Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned. And you woulda bought it. But sayin' I no longer got it. 'Cause you missed a line and never caught it. 'Cause it went over your head. because you're too stupid to get it. 'Cause you're mentally retarded. but pretend to be the smartest. With your expertise and knowledge. but you'll never be an artist. And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless. What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest. Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it. Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic. With a bottle full of malt liquor. But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer. The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom. If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet. I don't see why y'all even started with me. I get in beefs, my enemies die. I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased. I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'. Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink. I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats. I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze. ""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage. The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach! "". Shout to all my colorblind people. Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green. Aquamarine, or you think water is pink. ""Dawg, that's a date. "" ""Looks like an olive to me. "". ""Look, there's an apple! "" ""No, it's not, it's a peach! "". So finger-bang, Pootie Tang. Burger Kang, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang. Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say. Give me Donkey of the Day. What a way for 2018 to get underway. But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say. Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah). Invite 'em in like a One A Day. I'm not done (preach). 'Cause I feel like the beast of burden. That line in the sand, was it even worth it?. 'Cause the way I see people turning's. Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose. I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds. And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word. Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict. Or still yet to be determined?. 'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship. But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it. And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent. Sold the dream to that he's deserted. But I think it's workin'. These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous. And he's too scurred to answer me with words. 'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered. But I know at least he's heard it. 'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service. To meet in person to see. if I really think of hurtin' him. Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists. I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"". But my beef is more media journalists. (Hold up, hold up, hold up…). I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist. Can get a mouthful of flesh. And yes, I mean eating a penis. 'Cause they been pannin' my album to death. So I been givin' the media fingers. Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh. But they been puttin' me through the wringer. So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press. But I just took this beat to the cleaners"
killshot,"You sound like a bitch, bitch. Shut the fuck up. When your fans become your haters. You done?. Fuckin' beard's weird. Alright. You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke). We doin' this once. You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird. Why you yell at the mic? (Illa). Rihanna just hit me on a text. Last night I left hickeys on her neck. Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed. Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next. Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack. Was watchin' 8 Mile on my Nordictrack. Realized I forgot to call you back. Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap. Stan, Stan, son. Listen, man, Dad isn't mad. But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun. And have a man-bun?. The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable. Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked. Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me. I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze. Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!"". So before you die let's see who can out-petty who. With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")-ow, Kelly, ooh. But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you. By 29, I had three albums that had blew. Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do. Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food. But you're a fuckin' mole hill. Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!. Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow. Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow. Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt). Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up). Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?. What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?. 'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material. ...Dictionary.... ""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked. Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago. What do you know? Oops. Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof. Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02. To burn it in front of you, ho. Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true. I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you. 'Til I'm hitting old age. Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage. Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play. Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay. Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day. Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave. Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat. You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay. Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow. Kelly, they'll be putting your name. Next to Ja, next to Benzino-die, motherfucker!. Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain. Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah). My biggest flops are your greatest hits. The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks. So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss. Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?). Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait. In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name. Now I gotta cock back, aim. Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop). It's your moment. This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it. Had to give you a career to destroy it. Lethal injection. Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort. But if I was three-foot-eleven. You'd look up to me, and for the record. You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second. Lick a ballsack to get on my channel. Give your life to be as solidified. This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets. So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?. Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper. How the fuck can him and I battle?. He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel. I'll give him my sandals. 'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow. Exhausting, letting off on my offspring. Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!. You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see. You're fuckin' salty. 'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey. Your red sweater, your black leather. You dress better, I rap better. That a death threat or a love letter?. Little white toothpick. Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick. Thanks for dissing me. Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike"". But really I don't care who's in the right. But you're losin' the fight you picked. Who else want it? Kells-attempt fails! Budden-L's!. Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle. Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still. But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills. But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits. That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!. I'm sick of you bein' wack. And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune. So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it). I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth. Need to get the cock up out it. Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it). I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings. Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think. That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers). Don't mean you are, and you're not about it. So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it. You fuckin'-oh. And I'm just playin', Diddy. You know I love you"

the monster (feat. rihanna),"Rihanna. I'm friends with the monster. that's under my bed. Get a long with the voices inside of my head. You trying to save me. Stop holding your breath. And you think I'm crazy. yeah, you think I'm crazy. Eminem. I wanted the fame. but not the cover of Newsweek. Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey. Wanted to receive attention for my music. Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me. Been wanting my cake, and eat it too. And wanting it both ways. Fame made me a balloon. cause my ego inflated. When I blew; see, it was confusing. Cause all I wanted to do is. Be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf. Abused ink, used it as a tool. When I blew steam (wooh!). Hit the lottery, oh wee. With what I gave up to get was bittersweet. With this like winning a huge meet. Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge. I need a shrink. I'm beginning to lose sleep. One sheep, two sheep. Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith.

To seize the moment and don't squander it. 'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow. So I keep conjuring. Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from. (Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?. No wonder you losing your mind. The way it wanders). Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo. I think you've been wandering off down yonder. And stumbled onto Jeff Vanvonderen. 'Cause I need an interventionist. To intervene between me and this monster. And save me from myself and all this conflict. 'Cause the very thing that I love is killing me. And I can't conquer it. My Ocd is conking me in the head. Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking. I'm just relaying what the voice. In my head's saying. Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the. Rihanna.

Well, that's nothing. Well, that's nothing. Eminem. Call me crazy, but I have this vision. One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian. But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at. Emcees, blood get spilled and I. Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track. Give every kid who got played at. Pumped up feeling and shit to say back. To the kids who played 'em. I ain't here to save the fucking children. But if one kid out of a hundred million. Who are going through a struggle feels. And then relates that's great. It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back. In the draft, turn nothing into something. Still can make that. Straw into gold chump. I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack. Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts. I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that. It's nothing, I'm still friends with the. Rihanna.

Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em,. it's never the same. You want them when they don't want you. Soon as they do, feelings change. It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate. I wasn't looking. but I stumbled onto you, must've been fate. But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take. Let's cut to the chase. But a door shuts in your face.

But I love you so much it hurts. Never mistreated you once. I poured my heart out to you. Let down my guard, swear to god. I'll blow my brains in your lap. Lay here and die in your arms. Drop to my knees and I'm pleading. I'm trying to stop you from leaving. You won't even listen, so fuck it. I'm trying to stop you from breathing. I put both hands on your throat. I sit on top of you, squeezing. Til I snap ya neck like a Popsicle stick. Ain't no possible reason, I could think of. To let you walk up out this house, and let you live. Tears streamed down both of my cheeks. Then I let you go and just give. And before I put that gun to my temple. I told you this. And I would've do anything for you. To show you how much I adored you. But it's over now. It's too late to save our love. Just promise me you'll think of me every time. You look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a. Space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon. And I'm aiming right at you. Right at you. 250 thousand miles on a clear night in June. And I'm so lost without you. Without you. Without you"
good guy (feat. jessie reyez),"Here we go again. From heroes to villains. Used to be your Romeo. But we both were jilted. A couple of times. So we had a slippery slope to deal with. But still it gave me hope. That we'll get through it together. A severed earlobe. Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope. Would be dope, but. What kind of lengths can you go?. Pull a Vincent Van Gogh. Just to convince a damn ho. To be a housewife who outright lies. She's blackout drunk. Now she's backin' out my drive. I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?. She's just about my size. Hit me in the mouth twice. Guys, when someone you die for. sticks a steak knife in your heart. Do you try more?. Another late night in. She stumbles through my door. Lets the daylight in. And all we do's fight more. And I ain't violent. But she's goin' through my drawers. To plant the K-Y in. I'm gettin' accused by a whore. Who smells like St. Ides and. Who has probably screwed five more guys. sucked eight, nine men. I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens. Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win. Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in. And here's some two-ply for. When you date my friends. in order to wipe your ass. When you moved your bowels. When we renewed our vows. This the thanks I get. I'm waitin' for the date I can hear you say. ""Marshall, what a skank I've been. And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him"". Got your tubes tied for him. Got that boob job for him. Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in. After you, I swore to make the gray skies end. Here come the rays like wind. You get a pay hike and. Am I the good guy or do I just play like him. And hope that he dumps you?. It's like a dream come true. Just to scream ""Fuck you! "". Guess you take life in the same way. you play dice then. 'Cause you just look at me. and roll them little snake eyes in. Since. Since you bought the jury. They'll call me guilty. They'll call me guilty. You bought the jury. They'll call me guilty. Even though you know the real me. You can't beat a cheater. Convince a nonbeliever. And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out. But I let you say that you're the good guy. 'Cause this ain't what love looks like. You can't beat a cheater. Convince a nonbeliever. I ain't in my feelings, I'm out. But I let you say that you're the good guy. They like, ""You're the good guy. "". They like, they like, they like. ""You're the good guy. """

beautiful,"Lately I've been hard to reach. I've been too long on my own. Everybody has a private world. Where they can be alone. Are you calling me?. Are you trying to get through?. Are you reaching out for me?. I'm reaching out for you..... I'm just so fuckin depressed. I just can't seem to get out this slump. If I could just get over this hump,. But I need something to pull me out this dump. I took my bruises, took my lumps,. Fell down and I got right back up. But I need that spark. To get psyched back up. In order for me to pick the mic back up. I don't know how or why or when. I ended up being in this position I'm in. I'm startin to feel distant again,. So I decided just to pick this pen. Up and try to make an attempt to vent. But I just can't admit or come to grips. With the fact that I may be done with rap,. I need a new outlet. And I know some shit so hard to swallow,. But I just can't sit back and wallow. In my own sorrow,. But I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow. One tough act to follow. I'll be one tough act to follow. Here today, gone tomorrow,. But you'd have to walk a thousand miles.... Chorus. In my shoes. Just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you. Let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain. You feel mine, go inside each others minds. Just to see what we'd find. Look at shit through each others eyes. Don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Verse 2. I think I'm startin. To lose my sense of humor. everythings so tense and gloom. I almost feel like I got to check the temperture. Of the room just as soon as. I walk in, it's like all eyes on me. So I try to avoid any eye contact. Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation. Like I want that. I'm not looking for extra attention. I just want to be just like you. Blend in with the rest of the room. Maybe just point me to the closest restroom. I don't need no fuckin man servant. Tryna follow me around. And wipe my ass. And laugh at every single joke. I crack and half of them aint even funny like. ""ahh, marshall you're so funny man. ]you should be a comedian, god damn"". Unfortunately I am,. I just hide behind the tears of a clown. So why don't you all sit down. Listen to the tale I'm about to tell. Hell, we don't get to gotta trade our shoes. And you aint gotta walk no thousand miles. Chorus. In my shoes. Just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you. Let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain. You feel mine, go inside each others minds. Just to see what we'd find. Look at shit through each others eyes. But don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. So.... Verse 3. Nobody asked for life to deal us what these. Bullshit hands were dealt. We gotta take these cards ourselves,. And flip them, don't expect no help. Now I could of either just sat on my ass. And pissed and moaned. Or take this situation in which I'm placed. And get up and get my own. I was never the type of kid to wait by the door. And pack his bags. Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray for a dad. To show up who never did. I just wanted to fit in, in every single place. Every school I went. I dreamed of being that cool kid. Even if it meant actin stupid. And aunt edna was told me. Keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that. Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue. Tryna talk like ""thissss"". Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign. Pole at 8 years old. I learned my lesson then. Cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more. But I already told you my whole life story. Not just based on my description. Cause where you see it. From where you're sittin. It's probably 110 percent different. I guess we would have to walk a mile. In each others shoes at least. What size you wear?. I wear 10's, let's see if you could fit your feet.... Chorus. In my shoes. Just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you. Let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain. You feel mine, go inside each others minds. Just to see what we'd find. Look at shit through each others eyes. But don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Lately I've been hard to reach. I've been too long on my own. Everybody have their private world. Where they can be alone. Are you calling me?. Are you trying to get through?. Are you reaching out for me?. I'm reaching out for you.... *talking*. Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad will be home soon. And to the rest of the world. God gave you them shoes, to fit you. So put them on and wear em. Be yourself man. Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny. Don't ever let anyone tell you. You aint beautiful"

I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me. Never be as good, never be as good. Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?. I'm the greatest. Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention. Is you're one dimension. I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention. I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention. Muscles flexin', gotta strut like I flunked suspension. And you just stuck the key up in the ignition. And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah). Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft. I just slapped ISIS with a ISIS flag. bet you I come back twice as bad (uh). Revival didn't go viral!. Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road. Fuck that I'm finna hit back 'til I run out of gun powder. and split the scene. Hold the mic like similar to pistol squeeze. And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things. And my lips and the clips got the cig lit. like it's nicotine drinking, when slim gets mean. Bars on these boys when I split them schemes. That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's. Float like a butterfly. I'ma sting like a bee you ain't harming a thing. I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing. I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling. But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond. to even climb in the ring. An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali. 'cause I know one day I'm gonna be the. Greatest in the world, greatest in the world. greatest in the world. (No lie) I might be. The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it. the best to ever do it. I feel like the greatest, woke up to honkies sounding like me. Never be as good, never be as good. Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?. I'm the greatest"
sing for the moment,"[Verse 1]. These ideas are nightmares to white parents. Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair. And who likes earrings. Like whatever they say has no bearing,. it's so scary. In a house that allows no swearing. To see him walking around with his headphones blaring. Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care. He's a problem child. And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about. His fuckin' dad walkin' out. 'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out. If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out. His thoughts are whacked,. he's mad so he's talkin' back. Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap. He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap. His step-father hit him, so he socked him back,. and broke his nose. His house is a broken home,. there's no control,. he just let's his emotions go.... [Chorus]. {C'mon}, sing with me, {sing}, sing for the years. {Sing it}, sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, {c'mon). Sing it with me, just for today,. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away.... [Verse 2]. Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's. In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum. Holy or unholy, only have one homie. Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me. Yet everybody just feels like they can relate,. I guess words are a mothafucka. They can be great or they can degrade,. Or even worse they can teach hate. It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make. Like they worship us,. Plus all the stores ship us platinum. Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen. From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'. To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass. But then these critics crucify you,. journalists try to burn you. Fans turn on you,. attorneys all want a turn at you. To get they hands on every dime you have,. They want you to lose your mind every time you mad. So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon. Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns. That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me,. Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly. But all their kids be listenin' to me religiously,. So I'm signin' cd's while police fingerprint me. They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me. If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete. It's all political,. If my music is literal, and I'm a criminal. How the fuck can I raise a little girl. I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to. You're full of shit too, Guerrera,. that was a fist that hit you.... [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. They say music can alter moods and talk to you. Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too?. Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude. Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued. See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols. And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool. Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves,. We entertainers!. Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus!. But music is reflection of self, we just explain it,. And then we get our checks in the mail. It's fucked up, ain't it?. How we can come from practically nothing. to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted. That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing. Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine. Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long. Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs. Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives. Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die. Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe. We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes. That's why we seize the moment. Try to freeze it and own it,. squeeze it and hold it. Cause we consider these minutes golden. And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone. Just let our spirits live on. through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can..."

25 to life,"(Hook). Too late for the other side. Caught in a chase. 25 to life. Too late for the other side. Caught in a chase. 25 to life. Too late for the other side. Caught in a chase. 25 to life. Yeah, I can't keep chasing you. Taking my life back. Caught in a chase. 25 to life. (Verse 1). I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I've made. Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would've stayed. But I've already wasted over half of my life,. I would've laid. Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you. No more pain bitch you. Took me for granted took my heart. and ran it straight into the planet. Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it. Now my respect, I demand it. Imma take control of this relationship. Command it, and Imma be the boss of you now goddamnit. And what I mean. is that I will no longer let you control me. So you better hear me out this much you owe me. I gave up my life for you,. totally devoted to you while I've stayed. Paved for all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid. Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats,. go to work a mess. Always in a rush to get back to you,. I ain't heard you yet. Not even once say you appreciate me,. I deserve respect. I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness. And I know that if I end this, I'll no longer have nothing left. But you keep treating me like a staircase,. it's time to fucking step. And I won't be coming back,. so don't hold your fucking breath. You know what you've done no need to go in depth. I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left. I'd laugh while you wept. How's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it,. you neglected me. Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set. But a special place for you in my heart I have kept. It's unfortunate but it's. (Hook). Too late for the other side. (Yeah). Caught in a chase. 25 to life. (Can't take no more). Too late for the other side. Caught in a chase. 25 to life. (Verse 2). I feel like when I bend over backwards for you,. all you do is laugh. Cause that ain't good enough,. you expect me to fold myself in half. Til' I snap, don't think I'm loyal?, all I do is rap. How can I moonlight on the side. I have no life outside of that. Don't I give you enough of my time. You don't think so do you?. Jealous when I spend time with the girls. Why I'm married to you still man I don't know. But tonight I'm serving you with papers,. I'm divoricing you. Go marry someone else and make 'em famous. And take away their freedom like you did to me. Treat 'em like you don't need them,. and they ain't worthy of you. Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat. I'm moving on forget you oh, now I'm special?. I ain't felt special when I was with you. All I ever felt was this helplessness. Imprisoned by a selfish bitch. Chew me up and spit me out. I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous. And still I stick with this. I'm sick of this,. but in my my sickness and addiction. You're addictive as they get. Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em. My friends keep asking. why I can't just walk away from. I'm addicted, to the pain, the stress, the drama. I'm torn in,. so I guess imma mess, cursed and blessed. But this time I ain't changing my mind. I'm climbing out this abyss. You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed. But when you spoke of people. who meant the most to you. You left me off your list, fuck you hip-hop. I'm leaving you,. my life sentence is served bitch And it's just. (Hook).

Out the corner of his cornea. He just saw you run. All you want is to rest. Cause you can't run anymore. Your done. All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience. While everybody. Is watchin in the party applauding it. Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again. Contemplading my next plot again. Swallowin a colata pin. While I'm noddin. In and out on the autumn and. If the ramada inn. Holdin onto the pill bottle then. Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom. And make sure I got all of it. Wake up naked at mcdonalds. With. Blood all over me. Dead bodies. Behind the counter. SHIT. Guess I must of just blacked out again. NOT AGAIN. (Chorus). It's 3 a.m in the mornin. Put my key in the door. There's bodies layin all of the floor and. I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must. have killed em. Killed em. I said. It's 3 am in the mornin. Put my key in the door. There's bodies layin all of the floor and. I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must. of killed em. Killed em. (Verse 2). Sitting nude in my living room. It's almost noon. I wonder what's on the tube. Maybe they'll show some boobs. Surfing every channel. Until I find hannah montana. Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin. Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin. Every candle on top of the fire place. Mantalin. Grab my flannel and my bandana then. Kiss the naked manakin man again. You can see him standin in my. Front window. If you look in. I'm just a hooligan. Who's use to usin hallicinogens. Causin illusions again. Brain contusions again. Cutting and bruising the skin. Raise the scissors and pins. Jesus when does it end. Phases that I go through. Dazed and not so confused. Days that I don't know who. Gave these molecules too. Me. What am I gone do. Hey the prodical son. The diabolical one. Very mythogical. When I slaughtered them. (Chorus). It's 3 a.m in the mornin. Put my key in the door. There's bodies layin all of the floor and. I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must. have killed em. Killed em. I said. It's 3 am in the mornin. Put my key in the door. There's bodies layin all of the floor and. I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must. of killed em. Killed em.

Or else it gets the hose again. I cut and I slash slice and gash. Last night was a blast. I can't quite remember when I. Had that much fun. Off a half pint fifth of jack. My last vic and a half. A flashlight. Up kim kardashians ass. I remember the first time. I dismembered a family member. December I think it was. I was having drinks with my cuz. And I wrapped him. In christmas lights. Pushed him into the stinkin tub. Cut him up into pieces. Then just when I went to drink his. Blood. I thought I outta drink this bath water. That outta be fun. That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter. begun. The sight of blood excites me. That might be an artery son. Your blood coverin screams. Just don't seem to bother me none. It's 3 am. And here I come. So you should probably run. A secret passage way around here. Man there's got to be one. Oh no there's probably none. He can scream all that he wants. Top of his lungs. It ain't no stoppin me from choppin him up(up). (Chorus). Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin. Put my key in the door. There's bodies layin all of the floor and. I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must. have killed em. Killed em. I said. It's 3 am in the mornin. Put my key in the door. There's bodies layin all of the floor and.

3 questions,"Was I born to lose. C'mon muthafucker pick and choose. Between win or lose. Baby shoes, high-heeled shoes. Interviews, or kangaroos. Skatin down fuckin avenues. Wit you bag full of barbecues. And suddenly I blow a fuse. God she said I look like a porcupine. Would it be better if I took a hike with Frankenstein. Maybe I'll start thinking of giving my bike to. Palestine. Meet my friend Brit. She get real pissed off when muthafuckers ain't feelin her shit. She'll make you bleed if you fuck around with her per fit. You see her walkin round, clit ring and all,. Talkin your skit. K that's enuff for one verse. I don't think I cud've done no worse. So let me give you one of those that I put real well,. Gun curse. That's part of my story, if you wanna be firm. Brit'll put it down your pants, yea the earthworm. Don't wanna be sorry, don't eat the bad germ. If you do, just drink the pachiderm. Can my songs really make you get up and. dance. Well if they can, stay seated and take you cup to. France. I think that bitch still wants that fuckin poppin chance. Think of 50, Dre, and Eminem. They all battled and got succes and fame. Fuck benzino. He called my man slim a feminem, see now. I never really had much 'pac influence. Me had m.mathers and used it awful fluent. Part of my life I was taught in fight and anger. My people won't let me hide my middle finder. But everyday I teach the good things. to my little sista's. They only 2,3 years younger than me. But still need my help to be succesful in life, you see. And you really shud be givin that punch rite to me. You think I'm violent. Well think again,. If you want I'll let you alone in the silent. With my shit and weed I get high and thow a fit to. Anyone that gets close to my hand. My parents announced they were gonna get a divorce. It just became a lot worse. The whole opposite of me doin a verse. With a bunny or a horse. In fact, what I had I'll never get it back. I'll always have this sick mind in me. But what the fuck, just let my shit be.

3 verses,"I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless. Patrolling corners. Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters. I'm meaner in action. Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer. And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments. I grew up in the wild hood. As a hazardous youth. With a fucked up childhood. That I used as an excuse. And aint shit changed. But kept the same mindstate. Since the third time that I failed 9th grade. You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it. I don't promote violence I just encourage it. I laugh at the sight of death. As I fall down a cement flight of steps. And land inside a bed of spider webs. So throw caution to the wind. You and a friend. Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again. Shit, why not? Blow your brain out. I'm blowing mine out. Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now. It's only fair to warn. I was born with a set of horns. And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord. Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board. That smashed into your Honda Accord. With a 4 door Ford. But a more toward (?) droppin an accapella. The choppa (?) fella. The mozarella. Worse than a hellacopta propella. Got you locked in the cella. With your skeleton showing. Developing anorexia. While I'm standin next to ya. Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death. With an IV in your veins. Feeding you liquid darvicet. Pumping you full of drugs. Pull the plugs. On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs. Who were picked up in an ambulance. And driven. To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants. And given. A less than 20 percent chance. Of living. Have a possible placement. It's a hospital patient. Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement. Doctor Kevorkian has arrived. To perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'M STILL ALIVE!"". Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp. And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth. Better call the fire department. I've hired a arson. To set fire to carpet. And burn up your entire apartment. I'm a liar to start shit (?). Got your bitch wrapped around my dick. So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit. Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg. Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg. Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40. Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D. Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead. Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead. No more said case closed end of discussion. I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion. Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas. Cross the bombas. We blowin up your house killing your parents. and coming back to get your foster mommas. And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus. Cause I aint making no more threats. I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets. I'm more or less sick in the head. Maybe more cause I smoked crack. today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath. Walk the block with a labrador. Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador. Foul style galore. Verbal cow manure. Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure."

Verse 1: Eye-Kyu. Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right. I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime. My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats. Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets. Forgot a gold digger's succubus, my souls thick with ruggedness. With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this. I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound. On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch). We elevated to new heights premeditated. Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it. The escalated can be put to the test of greatness. Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it. So I take it that's the reason I'm hated. To represent my temperment. If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant. But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so). Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now). Everything that you collaborate I lacerate. My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate. At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate. I blasterate, and have you all running master gates. And as for face clutching and touching the flows. I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose. Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science. Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance. Defiance, no we won't have that. You want your shit to blow up?. Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack. And blast that shit to kingdom come. Then bring them some of this real hip-hop. I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about. And you all knew from Meeko. That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno. So stop that bullshit and flow.

You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC. I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T. I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot. I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott. Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me. I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory. It's either them or me man, kill or be killed. You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed. My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity. I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty. If he's acting soft and he cowers. He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers. You flowers got no clout with a thing. You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang. I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's. Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's. Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone. Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone. So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks. I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks. I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers. You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their. fingers. But you can bring yours let's see what you got. But don't front and never try to be what you're not. Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back. And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack. Chorus: Eye-Kyu.

The road to riches is closed for repair. So if the shoe ain't fittin', girl leave that shit alone. You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?. I rip your tissue out your ear. Spittin' like I don't care. My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year. So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up. Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump. When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit. Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit. Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down. They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now. At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk. Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked. Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck. Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck. Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind. I be stackin' up white rappers like I'm throwin' gas signs. And I'm, buck wild exposin' the plain truth. You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room. Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar. For this bad car, that go along with the breath. Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft. cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber. [Eminem] Yo Skam what the fuck you doin'?. Chorus. [Eminem]. Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change. I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name. Became late to the last show with a different dane. Brain ate from the last ode that I sniffed the cane. Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas. When your pukus, turnin to yellow with orange mucus. So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers. I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English. Freak genuis, too extreme for the weak and squeamish. Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinguished. Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence. Start a fire and block the hydrants. I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than. So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin. You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin. On the B-side of my first single with the clean version. Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin. Unless you get a kidney specimen from a spleen surgeon. In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery. To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally. I'll take it back before we do each others name. Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame. I'll take it further back than that. Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started. Cock block your fathers game. I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled. So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle. And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out. I'ma throw a head-but so hard, I'll knock us both out. Chorus"
50 ways,"Verse 1. You probably gonna think that I'm talking. About you and you goddamn right I am. Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you. Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct. Has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink. He still loves me cause he puts me in his ink. He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?. Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart. cause he misses me. I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky. And is no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he?. This bitch really thinks she can get me. If she still wants me, driving across country. Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth. Thinking to herself when's the next time. he's gonna punch me?. I told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once. And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk. Crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball. Bunched up nice and comfy. Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me. You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch. You thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this. Hook. The problem is all inside your head she said to me. The answer is easy if you take it logically. I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free. There must be 50 ways to leave your lover. Verse 2. I feel like a serial killer I keep dumping bodies in the lake. I'mma get caught and send up the river I shiver. When I think of the company I keep. How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep. I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink. Sex kept us together, when we slept together every-thing. Was all better, she made me feel like a king. Slowly, she began lowering my self-esteem. She go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her. And I just bought her a truck for 50, 000 dollars. Accused me of doing drugs and scream 'n holla"". Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana. And all I know is every time I go. To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow. The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke. That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago. And I wouldn't even let on like I know. What was I supposed to do, call her out on it, we just argue. Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script. Ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch. A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch. She thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this. Hook. The problem is all inside your head she said to me. The answer is easy if you take it logically. I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free. There must be 50 ways to leave your lover"
8 mile,"(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway). Sometimes I just feel like. Quittin I still might. Why do I put up this fight?. Why do I still write?. Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life. Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics. And show these people what my level of skill's like. But I'm still white. Sometimes I just hate life. Somethin' ain't right. Hit the break-lights. In case of the stage fright. Draw on the blank light. (Da-duh-duh-da-da, But if I fall,. It ain't my fault, My insides crawl). And I clam up (Smash!). I just slam shut. I just can't do it. My whole manhood's just been stripped. I've just been ripped. So I must been dipped. Get of the bus then split. Man fuck this shit yo. I'm goin the fuck home. World on my shoulders as. I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.. Chorus. I'm a man. I'ma make a new plan. Time for me to stand up and travel new land. Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands. Once I'm over these tracks man. I'ma never look back. (8 Mile Rd.). And I'm gone. I know where I'm goin. Sorry mama I've grown. I must travel alone. Ain't no followin no footsteps. I'm makin my own. Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.. Walkin these train tracks. Tryin to regain back the spirit I have. 'Fore I go back to the same crap (Smash!). To the same plant. And the same pants. Tryin to chase rap. Gotta move A.S.A.P.. Get a new plan. Mama's got a new man. Poor little baby sister. She don't understand. Sits in front of the Tv,. bury's her nose in the pad. And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand. While she colors her big brother,. her mother, and dad. Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head. Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had. But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad. Sometimes I get upset. Cuz I ain't blew up yet. It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet. Don't gotta rep my step. Don't got enough pep. The pressure's too much man. I'm just tryin to do what's best. And I try. Sit alone and I cry. Yo I won't tell a lie. Not a moment goes by. That I don't pray to the sky. Please I'm beggin you God. Please don't let me be pigeon holed in regular job. Yo I hope you can hear me hommie. Wherever you are. Yo I'm tellin you dog. I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow. Tell my mother I love her. Kiss baby sister goodbye. Say whenever you need me baby. I'm never too far. But yo, I gotta get out there. The only way I know. And I'ma be back for you. On the second that I blow. On everything I own. I'll make it on my own. Off to work I go. Back to this 8 Mile Rd.. Chorus. I'm a man. I'ma make a new plan. Time for me to stand up and travel new land. Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands. Once I'm over these tracks man. I'ma never look back. (8 Mile Rd.). And I'm gone. I know right where I'm goin. Sorry mama I've grown. I must travel alone. Ain't no followin no footsteps. I'm makin my own. Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.. Ya gotta live it to feel it. If you didn't you wouldn't get it. We'll see what the big deal is. Why it wasn't, it still is. To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit. It's different, it's a certain significant. certificate of authenticity. You'd never even see. But it's everything to me. It's my credibility. You've never seen, heard, smell,. or met an Mc. Who's incredible and on the same pedistal as me. But check. Still unsigned. Havin a rough time. Sit on the porch with all my friend's. who kick dumb rhymes. Go to work. And servin Mc's in the lunch line. But when it come's crunch time. Where do my punch lines go?. Who must I show to bust my flow?. Where must I go?. Who must I know?. Or am I just another crab in the bucket. Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it. Maybe I need a new outlit. I'm startin to doubt shit. I'm feelin a little septicole. Of who I hang out with. I look like a bum. Yo my clothes ain't about shit. At the Salvation Army. Tryin to salvage an outfit. And it's cold. Tryin to travel this road. Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode. My defenses are so up. And one thing I don't want. Is pity from no one. The city is no fun. There is no sun. And it's so dark. Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart. Being torn in my limbs. By each one of my friends. Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin. Sometimes I feel like a robot. Sometimes I just know not. what I'm doin. I just blow. My head is a stove top. I just explode. The kettle gets so hot. Sometimes my mouth just overloads. the acid I don't got. But I've learned. It's time for me to U-Turn. Yo it only takes one time for me to blow up. Ain't no fallin. The next time I meet a new girl. I can no longer play stupid. Or be Immature. I've got every ingredient. All I need is the courage. Like I already got to beat. All I need is the words. Got the urge. Suddenly its a search. Suddenly a new verse of energy has occurred. Time to show these free world leaders. Three in the third. I am no longer scared now. I'm free as a bird. And I turn and cross over. The median curb. Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.. Chorus. I'm a man. I'ma make a new plan. Time for me to stand up and travel new land. Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands. Once I'm over these tracks man. I'ma never look back. (8 Mile Rd.). And I'm gone. I know right where I'm goin. Sorry mama I've grown. I must travel alone. Ain't no followin no footsteps. I'm makin my own. Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd."
8 mile (g-unit remix),"Feat. Tony Yayo And Lloyd Banks. [50 Cent]. Yeah..50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo. G-UNIT!. [Lloyd Banks]. This rap shit plays a major part of my life. So if you jeapordize it I got the right. To send a mothafucka at you tonight. G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'. Swimmin' in barrels of money. Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy. It's funny, niggas rather see you sufferin' and hungry. I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money. Take your hats off, you know you ain't that tough. I'm callin' your bets off as soon as you act up. You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball. Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!). By the way, this feels like I'm dreamin'. Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen. The physical presence of a female, form of a demon. That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em. Get my nut while I'm breathin'. 'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'. That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?. You trippin', more records could get my ass in position. Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian. Listen, I went through my ambition in and out the kitchen. With probable cause, it's probably sendin' out to prison. You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours. We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards. [Tony Yayo]. You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me ('Cause what?). 'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto. Niggas hate when you do good. But when you broke, your friends and your enemies. They love you, they love you. ""Cheche, get the llello"". Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail. ""Cheche, get the llello"". Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!). You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie. I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country. Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low. White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow. It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane. I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble. I'll make your money double. Cook me in baking soda. I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover. I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator. Feed your family, turn your man into a hater. Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox. Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks. If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards. Cop a hundred grams, you movin' forwards. You tryin' to move more birds. ...In PA all day, on the corner of Third. [50 Cent]. You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?). 'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto. Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you. The shells hit you, you screamin'. Think I'm playin'? I mean it. Man, I done bought all these pistols. Lets get it poppin'. Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon). Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide. I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'. I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants. As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned. Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons. I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish. I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like ""50 nice chain"". Malasio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game. Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET. Nigga you see me!. I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good. or 'cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood. And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back. 'cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat. You pussy. Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga. They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga. Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga. Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga. Read the ""Daily News"" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga. I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit. Pussy, lets get it poppin'. G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit, G-Unit!"

He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Crankbook. Fuck the beat, I go acapella. Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody. Fuck y'all if you doubt me. I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly. And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,. Here, tell this people something they dont know about me."
9-1-1,"Eminem. Whoo! hahaha. Guess who's back!. Mommy! we're home!. Say hello to my little friends!. Dj muggs, soul assassins, cypress hill!. Everybody, put your hands where my eyes can see em!. (Eminem). Everywhere we go people know we roll deep as fuck. 40 50 Samoans aint no one wanna deal with us. 50 Twizzy obie there won't be no hoe in us. They pop shit like they gonna do shit but no one does. When we move down to texas back up to los angeles. We change the way we move so man up if you can't adjust. You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us. Its funny I guess money does have its advantages. And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched. Its not like we're just feelin ourselves that much it's just. That if someone ever does put us in the clutch. We just know that ya'll aint gonna be the one. Who's gonna do it. Cuz first of all you're pushy and everybody can see that. You fuck around get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at. That you got no business being in. And we aint even gonna be in it. No one's gonna hear nothin no one's gonna see the shit. And they'll be in and up out it them boys is bout it bout it. And the noise from clips n rounds. Will be drownded out by the crowd. And you'll be layin on the ground. Getting trampled by people dancing. Till the club closes and clears out. And that's when they see you flattened. Nobody saw it happen, all cuz the jaws are flappin. And you couldn't stop yappin and took it passed rappin. It aint about the music no more, its about tryin to show off. And it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off. Chorus: (eminem). Shit's about to change cuz we aint playin no games. We aint budgin neither are they and we aint sayin no names. Shit just aint the same when the cage get to sprayin. Hip hop is in a state of 9-1-1. It aint about hip hop cuz those days are gone. It aint about tryin to rip shop to get props no more. Its about tryin not to get popped. And get dropped to the floor cuz. Hip hop is in a state of 9-1-1. (be real). I took the strap off my holster cuz shit is getting serious. All these drugs you be fuckin with make you delirious. Thinkin you comin with heat yo son I'm curious. How long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us. Some people can never fade us they make us so curious. Mistake us for fakers homey with raider with glorious. We live it for real and others just makin the stories up. Illusions so broken so live it up you corny fucks. If you take a fuckin minute to think about what you done. When you stood against a gangsta. Who live and die by the gun. Caught a hot one sprayin you bitches till there was none. I'm like a rollin stone homey I got you under my thumb. You silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches. We cut you and give you stitches for envyin all our riches. Your game's just like a midget you clockin the small digit. Dealin with a giant goliath people. That's how we live it come on. Chorus. (the godfather). I'm gangsta gangsta who come to pay you a visit. On this shit that you call hip hop disfunction. Is where its headed. When I put it in motion my focus is getting breaded. My appetite for destruction is blasted. Because I say we got you. Stumblin for cover this music dyin in number. But you wouldn't pause and wonder admittin. Its all glamour when you. Enter the business you thinking you runnin shit. You witness that funny shit you bitches that aint shit. We gangsta we blast first ask questions later all these. Imitators paradin like they some playas tryin to. Save hip hop the task is something greater. Cuz we old fashion coded we loyalty motivators. Getting caught and not telling. Or more like killin not carin I'm ridin. A gangsta feelin no ferin when gangtas dyin I'm in a. Food circle with homeys that's suppose to bleed. On a 8 mile mission with cypress and og's. Chorus"

Uh, never meet a nigga first rap and beef with a shot of fam. Gucci's my absolute state of mind, like Waka's man. Chopper's brand, getting head in the car park, new Gallardo. This bitch sucking my dick today, call yesterday's news tomorrow. Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Thai roll. 'Bout to cross over, I'm the new Iver. 'bout to saves a couple of these bitches. That's right, I'm the new Bible. You? You 5.0, me? I'm all grounded to punishments. But I'm too fly though. Y'all niggas rewinding, I should call you moscato. [Eminem]. Look down at the poor boy. Looks like he got no parents, little shoes, they untied ho. Never know what type of a ho inside of my ride I may let. Last night at 5 AM, and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet. Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck. I can see why they fret. I already ran over two hoes and I ain't get up the fucking drive way yet. Soon as I open the door, you try to resist, what for?. Get in girl, don't push (?). Fightin' a war, it's useless, tits on a whore, little tits on a whore. Got a mack and it's screaming like little kids throwing fits on the floor. Get in the whip, but you ain't turning, a frog into a prince. What you tryna keep your hands on me for?. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. Now you in my whip as long as you understand that I can't be whipped. You sick of my shit, I'm a gigolo so you know, I'm always on the go. I ain't got no time to slow down for no relationshit. Drop the P and add a T, yaeh, you can get mad at me all you want. But I'm ghost before you can even say boo, hun let alone call me one. A one-night stand is only once but a female friend got one leg standing. But a one night stand on my nightstand. (?) I ain't fitting to argue but why. You think they call it boo? cause it sound like it's supposed to scare you. [Royce]. Ho, we can share you in the back of the Mclaren, I don't give a fuck. What your name is, I'll call you Hottentot, Hopenbot. How come your name is Sharon?. Slow the flow down so I can make. The same face when I'm shooting the guns is the same face I make when I fuck. The back of my hand on your neck pressing your face against the sheets it's insane. You been changed, cause I'm out of this world, girl I got that new (?) fame. I'm at an all-time high with highness, I'm at an all-time fly with flyness. And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. [Verse 3]. Never meet a nigga Twitter-beefing, first beef and I shot your fans. (You should check out the car when it's moving like watch this man). Her bottom's dark, but her top it tan. Her private parts on the pole. Like the opposite of her papa's plan. [Eminem]. Come on stripper! Let's ?. And drop the trance. [Royce]. Looking at this girl, like what you wearing. Quit playing!. [Eminem]. You wearing them scrach n sniff pants?. Well let me scratch em. [Royce]. What? Did I say that?. I'm on lean like styrofoam cups and kickstands. [Eminem]. Middle finger stuck on fuck. But girl you got a butt like ?. Aw Hell, Shady, he'll tell it like it is. So tell Katie Perry he's downstairs waiting. I'm here, bell's ringing and tell Lady. Gaga she can quit her job at the post office. She's still a male lady!. What the fuck? You heard, the verdict's in. He's allergic to D, that's the dick. [Royce]. I like the strip tease you doing. This evening, you and me gonna find. 3 more chickenheads and have a menage like Nick. You hot like a thick outfit in Texas. Without your underwear under it. Suck my dick, we both gets to steppin to my logic. [Eminem]. My dick is as hard as a yardstick. What we gonna do? Ride around til we're carsick. Then I'm gonna put this shit in park. And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot. Out of the trailer park by the garbage. What you waiting on? Me to roll up?. The condoms are in the glove compartment, lets start it!. Think I'm joking? What, am I sitting here. Trying to make fake farts with my armpits?. Am I here to amuse you?. [Royce]. I'm in your pocket outside of a church. The other hand is at the bottom of your purse. You giving me head in a boxing stance. My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt. I'm not your man, we're sparring partners. There's 5 things you are in charge of, that's. Sucking a dick, sucking a dick, sucking a dick. Sucking a dick, sucking a dick. [Eminem]. If you ain't sucking a dick. Why you sitting there with puckered lips? That's collagen... Motherfucking bitch, what you mean how'd you. Get suckered into this you gonna jump into my truck. And then try to get truculent?. [Royce]. You should be suffering, you should be cooking. You should be buckling your seatbelt with oven mitts. [Eminem]. I know I'm making an ass of myself, but it's just. Cause I wanna get... I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss. I wanted a kiss, a kiss, a kiss"
airplanes (part 2),"CHORUS. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now. VERSE ONE. Lets pretend like its 98, like I?m eating lunch off of a Styrofoam trey. Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A. Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain. Now lets pretend like I?m on the stage. And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (Ok). And everybody know my name (B.o.B). And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang. Oh yea and I just dropped my new album. On the first week I did 500thousand. Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall. And then a world tour just to top it all off. And let?s pretend like they call me the greatest. Selling out arenas with big ass stages. And everybody loved me and no one ever hated. Let?s try to use imagination. CHORUS. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now. VERSE TWO. Ok, let?s pretend like this never happened. Like I never had dreams of being a rapper. Like I didn?t write raps in all of my classes. Like I never use to runaway into the blackness. Now let?s pretend like it was all-good. Like I didn?t live starring in a notebook. Like I did the things I probably knew I should. But I didn?t have neighbors that?s why they call it hood. Now lets pretend like I aint got a name. Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray. I?m talking back before the mixtapes. Before the videos and the deals and the fame. Before they once compared me to Andre. Before I ever got my space. Before they ever noticed my face. So let?s just pretend and make wishes out of. airplanes. CHORUS (X2). Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now. BRIDGE. And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream. But those days are gone, there just memories. And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream. But those days are gone. VERSE THREE (EMINEM). Let?s Pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen. Let?s pretend things would?ve been no different. Pretend people procrastinated had no motivation. Pretend he just made excuses that was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind. Marshal you never gone make it, makes no sense to play the game it ain?t no way that?ll you win. Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends. Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend. And it wasn?t time to move in school no changing. again. He wasn?t socially awakard and just strange as a kid. He had a father and his mother wasn?t crazy as shit. And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit. Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch. You won?t amount to shit quit day dreaming kid. You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien. It just ain?t realistic. Now pretend they ain?t just make him angry with this shit. And there was no one he could even aim when he?s. pissed with. And his alarm went off to wake him but he did?nt make it to the rap Olympics. Left to his plane and he missed it. He?s gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and maybe these food stamps and WIC shit. Cause he neverrisked shit he hoped and he wished it. But it didn?t fall in his lap so he ain?t even hear it he pretends that. CHORUS. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now"

Better that than pissed on, i'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones. Catch me in the end zone, high stepping prime time. Thought you niggas been on, ain't no blocking my shine.

I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with. you. So here's a penny for your thoughts. But it won't buy you a chesseburger, but a nickle might just. get you one pickle. Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue. Theres a bombshell, scud missle!. I got this curse at you to fucking cuss at you. Like before I rap there was some motherfucking stud.

Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP. And each one thinks ""Say this shit"". Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief. I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine. Let em get a good taste of it. I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now. But in case you didn't. Imma stick this whole pad. full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it. Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it. So I pace this shit a little bit quicker. That clock i'm racing in doubling time it. But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time. It may take you pricks to catch on. While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong. Man I still say K-mart like theres an apostrophe ""S"" on it dog. And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess. I'm wrong.

almost famous,"I can almost taste it. This shit makes no sense to me. What does it all mean?. I can almost taste it. I can almost see it. This shit makes no sense to me. What does it all mean?. I can almost taste it. I can almost taste it. Can't stop now. This might be the last chance I get to be famous. (I just wanna be famous). You dream of trading places. I have been changing faces. You cannot fill these shoes. There is too much to lose. Wake up behind these trenches. You run around defenseless. There is too much to lose. You cannot fill these shoes. I just wanna be famous, but. Be careful what you wish for. I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist. They call me Slim Roethlisberger. I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker. I murk her with a Mossberg. I'm pissed off, get murdered. Like someone took a ketchup squirter. Squirted a frankfurter. For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants. When you saw the chainsaw get to waving. Like a terrible towel. How thangs turn around when his fangs come out. Get your brains blown out. That's what I call blowin' your mind. When I come back, like nut on your spine. I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son. Now here I come, screaming ""Attack! "". Like I just stepped on one. Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance. Giant scrotum. He don't owe them bitches shit. His britches, he outgrowed 'em. He's so out cold. He's knocked out at the South Pole. And nobody fucks with him. Rigor mortis and post mortem. He's dyin' of boredom. Take your best rhymes, record 'em. Then try to thwart him. He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em. Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy. Who licks the blades of his chainsaws. While he dips 'em in P. F. Chang's sauce?. Game's up, homie. Hang it up like some crank calls. You think I'm backin' down?. You must be out of your dang skulls. I'm almost famous. You dream of trading places. I have been changing faces. You cannot fill these shoes. There is too much to lose. Wake up behind these trenches. You run around defenseless. There is too much to lose. You cannot fill these shoes. I just wanna be famous, but. Be careful what you wish for. I'm back for revenge. I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again. I'm at your throat like strep. I step, strapped with a pen. Metaphors wrote on my hand. Some are just stored in my memory. Some I wrote on a napkin. I do what I have to to win. Pullin' out all stops. Any who touch a mic prior's. Not even Austin Powers. How the fuck are they Mike Myers?. And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko. 'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern. And smash it on his porch. Now get off my dick!. 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick. Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!. Don't call me the Champ. Call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer. I just blew up the Challenger. Matter fact, I need a lawyer. I just laced my gloves with. Enough plaster to make a cast. Beat his ass naked. And peed in his corner like Verne Troyer. Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes. See, he's in a whole nother weight class. He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets. You're full of it. You were dissin' his CD's, laughed at Infinite. Now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties. No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast. His new Slim Shady EP's. Got the attention of the mighty D. R. E. He's almost famous. You dream of trading places. I have been changing faces. You cannot fill these shoes. There is too much to lose. Wake up behind these trenches. You run around defenseless. There is too much to lose. You cannot fill these shoes. I just wanna be famous, but. Be careful what you wish for. Now there he goes in Dre's studio. Cuppin' his balls. Screamin' the wood off the panelin'. Cussin' the paint off the walls. Spewin' his hate to these haters. Showin' no love for these broads. He ain't givin' them shit. He says he'll pinch a penny so hard. He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark. You can see the mark. With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, ""Ahh! "". These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them. Not at all. If they don't like it, they can all get fucked. Instead of suckin' him off. They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by. Like David Carradine. They can go fuck themselves and just die. And eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it. He's mad at the whole world. So go to hell and build a snowman, girl. The bullies become bullied. And pussies get pushed. Then they better pull me. Take me back to 9th grade to school me. 'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward. This whole spot blowin'. Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?. And while I'm bein' poetic. Let me get it stoic and raise the bar. Higher than my opinion. Of these women's been lowered. So bear witness to some biblical shit. There's a cold wind blowin'. This world ain't gonna know what hit it. He did it, he made it, he's finally famous"

any man,"[Eminem]. Hi!. Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face. Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase. I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly. Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling. with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple. I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple. Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure. that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her. I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months. and said, ""I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"". The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell. I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell. I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs. and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns. I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach. and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it. (Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet. If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it. And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it. Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it. Chorus: Eminem.

A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium. than a maniac Saudi Arabian. A highly combustible head, spazmatic. strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed. Laid up in the hospital in critical condition. I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician. High speed, IV full of thai weed. Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese. twins, joined at the groin like lesbians. Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins. I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends. on if I keep on killin my girlfriends. Chorus: Eminem. Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan. for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin. is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?. Is fuckin crazy -- listen!!. Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan. for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin. is fuckin crazy -- you hear me?. Is fuckin crazy. [Eminem]. Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust. and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed. (Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say. I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play. I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day. of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH). Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin. Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine. Scratched my balls til I shredded skin. ""Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"". ""It's probably AIDS!"" Forget it then. I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows. that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos. So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats. and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus. Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded. My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it."
are you afraid? (freestyle),Are you afraid of a razor blade. In the shape of a spade. Blood dripping from it. Slice you up from the waist up. Ill drag ya dead body up a mountain. To da summot. Hang ya dirty ass then cut it. Fallin down the mountain. You will plumit. I i i cant believe this shit. Are you felling what i spit. If you cant. To bad bitch. I dont give a fuck. I aint got no luck. You fucking chicken. Hear you go cluck cluck cluck. Ahh freakin ahh freakin. I cant believe it. Ill swing my axe. Ill heave it. To ya head. You will be dead. Skurred. Datz all folks. I did my best to edit in the curses and curses. Ha ha ha
arose,"If I could rewind time like a tape,. inside a boombox. One day for every pill, or percocet that I ate. Cut down on the valium, that'll hurt everything. But death is turning so definite, wait. They got me all hooked up to some machine. I love you, being, didn't want you to. know I was struggling. Feels like I'm underwater submerged. like a submarine. Just heard that nurse say, my liver. and kidneys aren't functioning. Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing,. I guess. It's arrivederci, same nurse,. just heard say they're unplugging me. And it's your birthday, Jade,. I'm missing your birthday. Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate. when you hurt, Hai. And sweeties, thank you for waiting to. open gifts. But, girls, you can just open 'em, dad. ain't making it home for Christmas. Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss. I go to make a fist, but I can't make one,. I'm frozen stiff. I yell, but nothing comes out,. I'm crying inside, I shout. My vocal cords won't permit me,. I scream, but it's not allowed. You put your arm around mama, the karma, wow. I just thought about the aisle,. I'll never get to walk us down. Never see you, graduate in your caps and gowns. It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?. I've got so much more to do, and Proof, I'm truly sorry. If I let you down, but this tore me in two. The thought of no more me and you. You gave me shoes, Nikes like. new for me for school. Doody, I'm trying, but you, you. were the glue that binded. So many things, time, I'd give. anything to rewind it. I had to walk down my halls and. constantly be reminded. By pictures all on my walls and. I couldn't sleep at night 'cause. That image burned in my brain of you on the table. Me falling across your body,. not able to stand to save you. God, why did you take him?. I'm tryna keep his legacy alive,. but I'm dying, where's Nathan?. Little ladies, be brave, take. care of your mother. Smile pretty for pictures, always. cherish each other. I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory. And I know you'll never forget me, just don't get sad when remembering. And, little bro, keep making me proud. You better marry that girl 'cause. she's faithfully down. And when you're exchanging those. sacred vows, just know that if I could be there. I would and should you ever see. parenthood, I know you'll be good at it. Oh, almost forgot to do something,. thank my father too. I actually learnt a lot from you,. you taught me what not to do. And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance. To have one last heart-to-heart. honest and open talk to you. Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you. And I can feel my soul leave my. body and float across the room. Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out. Then the sheet over my head, shut. the room down. Girls, please don't get upset,. I see them cheeks soaking and wet. As you squeeze hold of my neck,. so forcibly, don't wanna let. Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks. With every second, each closer to death. But suddenly, I feel my heart begin to beat slow. Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*). Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit. I'm tryna rewind time like a tape, find an escape. Make a beeline, try and awake. From this dream, I need to re-find. My inner strength, to remind me. Even if a steep climb I must take. To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape. (I don't want it). I'll put out this last album,. then I'm done with it. One hundred percent finished, fed up with it. I'm hanging it up, fuck it. Excuse the cursing, baby,. but just know. That I'm a good person, though. they portray me as cold. And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't. I'm pledging to throw this. methadone in the toilet. Shred these old letters I wrote. All that old pathetic loathing,. closing credits can roll. I'm proud to be back, I'm 'bout to,. like a rematch. Outdo Relapse. With Recovery, Mathers Lp2. Help propel me to victory laps. Gas toward them and fast forward the past. Consider the last four minutes as. The song I'd have sang to my daughters. If I'd have made it to the hospital. Less than two hours later, but I fought it. Came back like a boomerang on 'em. Now a new day is dawning, I'm up,. Tuesday, it's morning. Now I know"
as the world turns,"(Chorus 2X). I don't know why this world keeps turning. Round and Round. But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now. Yes man. As the World Turns. We all experience things in life. Trials and Tribulations. That we all must go through. When someone wants to test us. When someone tries our patience. [Eminem]. I hang with a bunch of hippies. and wacky tobacco planters. Who swallow lit roaches. and light up like jack-o-lanterns. Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts. Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source. They never should've booted me out of reform school. Deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool. They threw me out the Ramada Inn. I said it wasn't me, I got a twin. (Oh my god it's you! Not again!). It all started when my mother took my bike away. Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the. microwave. After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers. Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my. counselors. Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman. Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin. And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,. He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed. May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class. That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim. Fast (Who Me?). Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig. She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig. Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig. I felt the evilness and started transformin (RARRRR!). It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming. Grabbed that bitch by her hair. Drug her across the ground. And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down. Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop. While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop. (Chorus). As the World Turns. These are the days of our lives. These are the things that we must go through. Day by day. [Eminem]. We drive around in million dollar sports cars. While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards. Outsiders, and we suing the courts. Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source. Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat. Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at. Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage. It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch. I met a slut and said ""What up, it's nice to meet ya"". I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza. But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month. But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt. But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers. Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist. So gimme all your money. And don't try nothin funny. Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to. outrun me. I went to grab my gun. Thats when her ass put it on me. Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry. I fell through the glass doors. Started causin a scene. Then slid across the floor and flew right into a. washin machine. Jumped up with a broken back. Thank god I was smokin crack all day. And doped up off coke and smack. All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her. purse. Now I wanna kill her. But so I gotta catch her first. Ran through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut. Saw the house she ran up in. And shot her fuckin porch up. Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut. Looked around the room. Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut. I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!. You might as well come out now. She said ""Come in, its unlocked!"". I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne. And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay. porn. She said ""Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"". I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained. it. She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her. I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off. her. I started to beg ""No, please let go"". But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg. roll. With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled. I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right. nipple. Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered. this magic trick. Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!. Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it. It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power. outage. I shouted ""Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"". Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut. to death (Ahh!! Ahhh!). Come here bitch!. Come here!. Take this motherfuckin dick!. Bitch, come here!. Chorus to fade. And as we go along. Throughout the days of our lives. We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday. That we must go through. These are the things that surround us through our. atmosphere. Every day. Every single day the world keeps turning. Keeps turning"

asshole (feat. skylar grey),"[verse: 1]. Came to the world in a time where it was in need of a villain. An asshole that well I think I succeeded in fulfilling. Better not think I will ever stop. To think I was speaking to children. Everything was happening so fast. That was... then everything went blank. All I remember. Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling. Like I am always under attack man. I could stack my shit list to the ceiling. Women dish him but really thinking. If someone talks to my little girls like this I would kill him. Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite. When I'm ripping shit. [2: 55 to end]. Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth. I smack your girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull. Thinkin we have some magnetic pull. Screamin icp in this bitch, how do fuckin magnets work!. Cause your ejaculate, we ain't attractable. Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical. I'm making up words you can understandable. it's tragical. Thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen?. that ain't practical. you crackin a joke. it's laughable, cause me and love's. like a bad combination, I keep them feelings. locked in a vault, so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable. my heart is truly guarded, fullbody armor. Bitch you just need a helmet. because if you think you're special, you're retarded. thinkin you're one of a kind. like you got some platinum vagina, you're a train wreck. I got a one track mind. Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er. Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor. Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog. cause you're on my ass. But you can't get a scent. because all of my spare time is spent. With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin. Only women that I love are my daughters. And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds. like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther. So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line. It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up. So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time. It ain't never gonna stop. a pessimist. who transforms you to optimus in his prime. so even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive. Throw all my half empty glass in a cup. so now my cup is runneth over. And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster. I'm goin back to what got me here, yeah cocky. and can't not been? rude off? so fear not my dear. and dry up your teardrops I'm here.

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]. As I think back, retract, from the classroom to the trap. Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps. It''s hard to relax when your wage minimum, being broke. Fuck, with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem. I was trying to get on demo tapes state to state. Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes. Relying on faith hoping my dreams take shape. And my fate meeting (?). I would wait for these A&R?s say I ain?t grind bitch. Spending my last dime on this studio time shit. A lot of folk told me I was stupid for trying this. Situation crucial feds off in my climate. Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly. The spot got hot, scene felt like curry. Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta. Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together. Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever. You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather. Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better. I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort. [Bridge: Stat Quo]. I'm patiently waiting used to get love.

So that you cats know, this is Statlanta 101. Cause we don't want no one walking out this motherfucker with tunnel vision. So anyone with questions you want answered.

I can care less, fuck yall, you don't make or break me. Real niggas love me, pussy niggas hate me. Down bitches ride for Stat Quo, they know. The A-Town D Young County be trill folk. Didn't no other label offer me no deal. Till they found out Shady/ Aftermath was interested. Then they started to beg, want the truth, there it is. This ain't a gimmick, this the south and I be that kid. Just ride through watching lines of his rhymes. In time you're going to find you're on a great trip. Ain't a word I could life be some extraordinary shit. The piece of the puzzle that fit, it's Stat Quo, you son of a bitch. [Hook]. [Develdiii]"

Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this. Get your ass back in that game. Bitch don't take shit for granted. And don't take shit, give it!. Only bull you should take is by the horns.

An erratic train of thought. Like splatter paint. Scatter brain. Yeah maybe why that explains. Why you're back but you don't rap the same. And you're looking way thinner. Because your hunger got you looking like. A took away dinner. Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat. a fucking booger though. Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat. When you say you're a chooka what chooka what. Now fling that bitch from your fingertips. I hope it lands on another rap singers lips. Who can't think of shit. Anything of wit, that's intresting to spit. Whose king of this fucking english lit?. Let your middle fingers flip. On each hand, whilst extending this shit. How low can you go?. Lower then Chuck D ho. Hear the bass of this in my voice. Rocky's back, where's my adrian. Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius. I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap. Not a man, I'm a weapon. Who just happened to be a rapper. Who just happen to be on the crapper. When it happened I had an epiphany. In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after. Now I'm back with an apper-tite. For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster. So let's eat cos' I'm fammished. Every deed is a bastardly one. Evil its past it. Even you asking for me to be pulled. Like to people. Is like me having my teeth pulled. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. [?]"
backstabber,"Police voice:. Attention all units, attention all units. We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair. I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair. He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife. Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's. He could be coming at your girlfriend next. Verse 1:. There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward. His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward. He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm. He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm. Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair. Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there. He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes. Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks. Chorus:. I make you think you're a best friend then. Why I oughtta. Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then. Why I oughtta. Stay away from him he ain't no good!. Verse 2:. We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed. Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms. Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors. Locking down every block and put up metal detectors. Protectors and be sure that you stand close. Watch each others backs and guard your command post. And most of all be advised that he's wise. He could be disguised as one of your very own guys. Chorus:. I make you think you're a best friend then. Why I oughtta. Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then. Why I oughtta. Stay away from him he ain't no good!. Verse 3:. I'm on a solo mission to find him personally. To settle the score and beat then him mercifully. For what he first did to me. It's sure to be the last. Following footprints with a magnifying glass. To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell. I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail. I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar. ""Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"". Chorus:. I make you think you're a best friend then. Why I oughtta. Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then. Why I oughtta. Stay away from him he ain't no good!. Verse 4:. I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps. Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs. Inside the depths of his basement. I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place… went!. I saw my life flash in front of my eyes. I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs. None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed. Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume. Chorus:. I make you think you're a best friend then. Why I oughtta. Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then. Why I oughtta. Stay away from him he ain't no good!. Verse 5:. Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned. They're only powerful when you got your back turned. I yearned for the day that we finally met again. So I can give him a taste of his own medicine. He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean. I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen. Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home. Beating him over the head with the telephone. Police voice:. Attention all cars, attention all cars. Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect. He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat. He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?. Chorus:.

bad guy,"It's like I'm in this dirt diggin' up old hurt. Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work. All it takes is one song on the radio yer, right back on it. Remindin' me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt. Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search. Maybe I needed to grow up a little first. Well looks like I hit a growth spurt. But I'm comin' for closure. Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for. The way that you turned your back on me just. When I may have needed you most, oh, you thought it was over. You could just close the chapter. And go about your life like it was nothin'. You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine. Well I've never recovered, but tonight 'betcha that whatch yer. 'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered. Can't think of a, better way to define poetic justice. Can I hold grudges? Mind is sayin' ""let it go fuck this"". Heart is sayin' ""I will once I bury this bitch alive hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"" and.... I flee the scene, like it was my last ride. You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time. You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify. What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy. I just hate to be the bad guy. And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch. To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit. Think you can hurt people and just keep getting' away with it?. Not this time you, better go and get sewing kit, bitch. Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew, knit wit. Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it. You left our family in shambles. And you expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed?. Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten. And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long. That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to git 'cha. You're wrong and that shit was rotten. And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold. Have you any idea the shit I've gone through?. Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to. Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing. Letters you don't respond to 'em. Fuck it, I'm coming to see you. And gee who better to talk to than you?. The cause of my problems. My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you. Puff, then I'm gone. I flee the scene like it was my last ride. You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time. You can see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good. And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy. I've been driving around your side of this town. Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now. Finally I found your new address, park in your drive. Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life. And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva. My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house. See, it's sad it came to this point. Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya. But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology. Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek. So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window. Like I reach my full potential, I peeked. Continue to peep, still bent low. Then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo. Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch. Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this. You don't plan for intruders beforehand?. Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?. Gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack up a lung. Like you picked an axe up and then swung. Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk. By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?. Now who's a faggot, you punk?. And here's your bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck. It's just me, you and the music now, Slim. I hope you hear it, we're in a car right now. Wait, here comes my favorite lyric. ""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"". And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers Lp. Just to try to get people to buy. How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun. Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done. Eminem killed by m and m. Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials. I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it. Since you're in love with your city so much. I figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here. Two more exits, time is quite near. Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear. That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea. As cops appear in my driver side mirror. (Oh, God, police! Ah!). Hope Fox Trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least. New plan Stan. Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln town car. Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you. Slim, this is for him and frank ocean, oh hope you can swim good. Now say you hate homos again. I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend. I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and woke up still in. I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen. Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin. Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in. When they say all of this is approaching its end. But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again. Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds. Toilets clogged, yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up. But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers. After the track is demolished. I am your lack of a conscience. I'm the ringing in your ears. I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils. Eating your vocal chords after your concerts. I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged. Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow. I'm the bullies you hate, that you became. With every faggot you slaughtered. Coming back on you, every woman you insult. Batter, with the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters. I represent everything you take for granted. 'Cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona's half a façade. And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone. 'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name. Cameras are off. Sad, but it happens to all of them. I'm the hindsight to say I told you so. Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow. I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow. If you don't stop after they call you the. Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits. When it's time to walk away. I'm every guilt trip. The baggage you have. But as you gather up all your possessions. If there's anything you have left to say. Unless it makes an impact don't bother. So before you rest your case. Better make sure you're packing a wallop. So one last time, I'm back. Before it fades into black and it's all over. Behold the final chapter in a saga. Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle. Twice the magic that started it all. Tragic portrait of an artist tortured. Trapped in his own drawings. Tap into thoughts. Blacker and darker than anything imaginable. Here goes a wild stab in the dark. As we pick up where the last Mathers left off"
bad guys always die,"(Dre). All you see is the sun. Reflecting off of the gun. Get ready for the showdown. It go down at one. Sweat on my brow. Let's settle it now. I'm a show you how real cowboys get down. I'm polishin gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold. I got a blunt rolled. Feelin' bold, Gangstas blood runs cold. It's time to reload this ol' 45 cold. The wind's rushin, it's hot muggy & dusty. I bust a couple a shots, make sure i'm not rusty. It's past noon, they should be here soon. Sip a lil moonshine, inside of some loom. All a sudden i could hear the sounds of hooves. It sounds like a thousand wolves. I cocked back, toastin the host that froze. I pose like a poster, it's closer than close. I hope the heat's dirty. I heard he fights dirty. But i'm a leave 30 inside him & leave early. And just when I went to feel him ??. I put the gun to his head, & this is what he said. (Eminem). You never met, me. You'll prolly never see me again. But I know you, the name's Slim. You want revenge?. Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you. I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too. CHORUS:. Ya ride like a cowboy toward the sun. Life ain't fun when you're on the run. Got your gold & you got your gun. But life as a outlaw just begun. Got your shotgun by your side. Got your horse & you got your pride. Ya ride 'til there ain't no place to hide. It's sad 'cuz the bad guys always die. (Dre). He was shady, you can see him by the look on his face. He said take 10 paces, shit, I took 8. Spun around & I aimed straight for the brain. My shit went bang, but it only fired a blank. He said (You need bullets, hurry up, run!). I put a clip in the gun & pointed it at his arms. He pointed it & you at the same time and I stood stunned. (Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want). I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I. didn't shoot. So what we gon' do, it's on you. Did you recall when you and Snoop was a group? (the Chronic). Well all we gotta do is find the map to part 2. Plus I know who's got it (Who). Some old dude, He's got 26 plaques and he's already sold 2. I loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle. Here are two pieces of gold inside of my statues. We rolled two miles until we hit the spot. An old ghost town that everybody forgot. A place where I used to smoke chronic a lot. Slim grabbed his shot gun. (Eminem). Dre here's the plot. This is the spot. They call him Doc Loveless. He's goin' around sayin' he took the game from us. (Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'). He ain't go no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach. He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs. Plus he's more respected by the hip hop edge. My mission, is to get him to stop layin' eggs and. We could put him on his back down a fligh of steps. (I drew two guns and spun 'em on my fingers. Get the swingers doin it, startin' gun slingin. I could hear somebody singin'. Sounded like a g-thang and a verse from ""keep they heads ringin"". I said it's Dre's day and started to spray. Instead a 18-hundred, he pulls an AK. All a chips started flyin' every which way. (Eminem). That's when I saw Dre in trouble and game to the gage. I fired the first shot, He spun his body around. He hit the ground and landed upside down. Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold. I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled. CHORUS 2X"
bad husband (feat. x ambassadors),"We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye. Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight. So much baggage, need a luggage rack. But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds. Oh, back in the news, love taps when I dissed you. Like it was fun, actually used to run. Back to the booth, jump back in the studio. Give you a tongue lashing then you. Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone. It was funny, back in our youth. But then it wasn't after we knew. That we were done and actually through (and actually through). But if there's one fraction of truth. If it could be spun back I would do so many things different. 'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse. You hit me once, and that I would use. To continue the pattern of abuse. Why did I punch back?. Girls, your dad is a scumbag. I'm confused because. How come you can be a lord and a loser?. How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?. A good dad, but a bad husband. Why are you a good father. A great dad, but a bad husband?. You were the beat I love, with a writer's block. Just a line that's hot, that I forgot. We laughed a little, cried a lot. I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie. Day before you went to jail and daily. How we would wait for that mail lady. Or by the phone, for mom to call. And I watch you pull yourself up. And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all. You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark. I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box. When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot. Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not. Every time we fought, the insults they got. Thrown too far. Words that we said that we didn't mean. The words that we meant that we didn't say. The ones that we thought that should've said. Letters written that we coulda read. Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead. And had this put to bed. But I'd be lying still if I wasn't sitting here asking myself. How come you can be a lord and a loser?. How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?. A good dad, but a bad husband. Why are you a good father?. A great dad, but a bad husband. (dad) (you said). Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply). But there's always another side to a good father. A great dad, but a bad husband. We brought out the worst in each other. Someone had to make the sparring end. 'Cause I loved you but I hated that me. And I don't wanna see that side again. But I'm sorry Kim. More than you could ever comprehend. Leaving you was fucking harder than. Sawing off a fucking body limb. Once upon a time where all we had. Maybe that was what drew us to each other. It was true love shit that we never knew was possible. We might have loved each other too much. And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other. All the screw-ups. 'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me. And I was thinking I was more in love than you was. For all the times that we thought it worked. 'Til we saw how wrong we were. When the dust settles now and all the dirt. And if I touch the rawest nerve all I want is for us not to hurt. And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words. But I just heard ""Mockingbird"". And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts. The purpose was not to stir up open wounds. I've caused got a few, and so have you. Or argue whose fault it was, partly yours, partly mine. But really no one's, this is so tough. I'm getting choked up. Oh fuck it, we both suck. We broke up, got back together. We both thought we had forever. Not bad people, just bad together. We were so nuts, backstabbed each other. Another blow struck, but there's no ducking this blow. 'Cause it's over, and it's closure. But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know. How some people can be so good. At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother. Shit, it's no wonder. How come you can be a lord and a loser?. How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?. A good dad, but a bad husband. Why are you a good father?. A great dad, but a bad husband. (dad) (you said). Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply). But there's always another side to a good father. A great dad, but a bad husband"
bad influence,"Chorus One]. {Just pull the plug!}. People say that I'm a bad influence. I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it. They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}. C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it. {Just pull the plug!}. People say that I'm a bad influence. I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it. They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}. C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it. {Just let it goooooo!}. [Eminem]. Hand me an ,8, beam me up and land me in space. I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here} and shit on Brandy and. Mase. I'm more than ill. I'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill. {Ahh!}. Human horror film. but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me. cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not. {yup}. As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot. I'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht. But I would like an award. for the best rapper to get one mic in The Source. and a wardrobe I can afford. Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford. And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for. Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank. looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off. No shit I'm a great danger to my health. Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury. myself?. [Chorus Two]. {Just pull the plug!}. People say that I'm a bad influence. I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it. They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}. C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it. {Just let it gooo!}. People say that I'm a bad influence. I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it. They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}. C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it. {Just do it!}. [Eminem]. I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners. Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of. quarters. I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.. across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}. I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth. with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse. And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate. since the third time that I failed 9th grade. You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure. of it. I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}. I laugh at the sight of death. as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}. and land inside a bed of spider webs. So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend. can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again. Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out. Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!. [Chorus Three]. {Just let it gooo!}. People say that I'm a bad influence. I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it. They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}. C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it. {Just pull the plug!}. People say that I'm a bad influence. I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it. They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}. C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it. {Just do it!}. [Eminem]. My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist. Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face. and place the clip and cock it back. and let it go until your brains are rippin out. your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches. I'm not a ""Role Model,"" I don't wanna babysit kids. I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business. And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off. Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?. I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got. You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's. And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got. I knew that ""Just the Two of Us"" would make you hate me this. much. And ""Just the Two of Us,"" that ain't got shit to do with us. and our personal life, it's just words on a mic. So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig. But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!"
"bad meets evil (feat. royce da 5'9"")","[intro]. [Cowboy]. I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts. You know, there's a story behind that there saloon. Twenty years ago, two outlaws. took this whole town over. Sheriffs couldn't stop em. Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen. Got murdered in cold blood. That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from. home. They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that. tavern. And on a quiet night. You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and. Royce Da Five-Nine. [Eminem]. I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet. I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat. I translate when my voice is read through a. sismograph. And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through. Royce's head (Aahhh). Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his. bed. Till the evilness flows through his blood like. poisonous lead. Told him each one of his boys is dead. I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice. and said. [Royce]. Who hard? yo I done heard worse. We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other. To see which one'll swerve first. Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds. That of a globe on top of nine other planets. Kissed the cheek of the devil. Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on. speakers in the ghetto. Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of. an atheist. Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot. One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ. corpse. In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the. white horse. And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the. nations. Collaborating, attemptin to take over the earth. [Eminem]. Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil. We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people. He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal. Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either. (shit, me neither). We ain't eager to be legal. So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle. I breathe ether in three amounts. When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle. Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range. Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain. (He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off. Cuz I can't find a decent vein. [Royce]. The disaster wit dreds. I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long. enough. To kill my soul after I'm dead. When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar. to a waiter. Cuz I serve any stranger wit money. I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains. While slippin bullets at point blank range like they. was punches. Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you. then come to your funeral. Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you. Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws. Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and. glass. I'm blazin Mc's, at the same time amazin Mc's. Somehow Mc's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me. From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to. cast a avalanche. And bust till volcanoes errupt. [interlude]. *phone rings*. Hello? (Billy) Aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get. you). Stop, They Know It'S Us!!. [Eminem]. I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-ah). I'm the one who burned your house down (oh). Well I'm out now (shit), and this time I'm comin back. to blow your house up. And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of. Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms. And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms. And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave. I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe. [Royce] (Eminem). Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil. And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese. people. He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal. Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel. (We'll be waitin) See you in hell. Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady. See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye). Bad Meets Evil, what? (till next time). [Cowboy]. And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil. Two of the most wanted individuals in the county. Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like. law-abiding citizens. It's too bad they had to go out the way they did. Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon. But their spirits still live on till this day. Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?. [Footsteps and windblowing]"

beautiful,"Lately I've been hard to reach. I've been too long on my own. Everybody has a private world. Where they can be alone. Are you calling me?. Are you trying to get through?. Are you reaching out for me?. I'm reaching out for you..... I'm just so fuckin depressed. I just can't seem to get out this slump. If I could just get over this hump,. But I need something to pull me out this dump. I took my bruises, took my lumps,. Fell down and I got right back up. But I need that spark. To get psyched back up. In order for me to pick the mic back up. I don't know how or why or when. I ended up being in this position I'm in. I'm startin to feel distant again,. So I decided just to pick this pen. Up and try to make an attempt to vent. But I just can't admit or come to grips. With the fact that I may be done with rap,. I need a new outlet. And I know some shit so hard to swallow,. But I just can't sit back and wallow. In my own sorrow,. But I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow. One tough act to follow. I'll be one tough act to follow. Here today, gone tomorrow,. But you'd have to walk a thousand miles.... Chorus. In my shoes. Just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you. Let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain. You feel mine, go inside each others minds. Just to see what we'd find. Look at shit through each others eyes. Don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Verse 2. I think I'm startin. To lose my sense of humor. everythings so tense and gloom. I almost feel like I got to check the temperture. Of the room just as soon as. I walk in, it's like all eyes on me. So I try to avoid any eye contact. Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation. Like I want that. I'm not looking for extra attention. I just want to be just like you. Blend in with the rest of the room. Maybe just point me to the closest restroom. I don't need no fuckin man servant. Tryna follow me around. And wipe my ass. And laugh at every single joke. I crack and half of them aint even funny like. ""ahh, marshall you're so funny man. ]you should be a comedian, god damn"". Unfortunately I am,. I just hide behind the tears of a clown. So why don't you all sit down. Listen to the tale I'm about to tell. Hell, we don't get to gotta trade our shoes. And you aint gotta walk no thousand miles. Chorus. In my shoes. Just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you. Let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain. You feel mine, go inside each others minds. Just to see what we'd find. Look at shit through each others eyes. But don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. So.... Verse 3. Nobody asked for life to deal us what these. Bullshit hands were dealt. We gotta take these cards ourselves,. And flip them, don't expect no help. Now I could of either just sat on my ass. And pissed and moaned. Or take this situation in which I'm placed. And get up and get my own. I was never the type of kid to wait by the door. And pack his bags. Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray for a dad. To show up who never did. I just wanted to fit in, in every single place. Every school I went. I dreamed of being that cool kid. Even if it meant actin stupid. And aunt edna was told me. Keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that. Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue. Tryna talk like ""thissss"". Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign. Pole at 8 years old. I learned my lesson then. Cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more. But I already told you my whole life story. Not just based on my description. Cause where you see it. From where you're sittin. It's probably 110 percent different. I guess we would have to walk a mile. In each others shoes at least. What size you wear?. I wear 10's, let's see if you could fit your feet.... Chorus. In my shoes. Just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you. Let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain. You feel mine, go inside each others minds. Just to see what we'd find. Look at shit through each others eyes. But don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Don't let them say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you. Lately I've been hard to reach. I've been too long on my own. Everybody have their private world. Where they can be alone. Are you calling me?. Are you trying to get through?. Are you reaching out for me?. I'm reaching out for you.... *talking*. Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad will be home soon. And to the rest of the world. God gave you them shoes, to fit you. So put them on and wear em. Be yourself man. Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny. Don't ever let anyone tell you. You aint beautiful"
beautiful pain (feat. sia),"[Eminem and Sia]. I can feel the heat rising. Everything is on fire. Today is a painful reminder of why. We can only get brighter. The further you put it behind ya. And right now I'm on the inside. Lookin' out, 'cause. [Sia]. Standing in the flames. There's a beautiful kind of pain. Setting fire to yesterday. Find the light, find the light, find the light. I found her in the flames. There's a beautiful kind of pain. Setting fire to yesterday. Find the light, find the light, find the light. [Eminem]. Yesterday was the tornado warning. Today is like the morning after. Your world is torn in half, you wake. And let's wait to start the morning process. Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress. Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass. The thunderstorm has passed ya. Your weather didn't poke his eyes out. With the thorn bush that you. Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale. Can't even tell your nose is stuffed. So focused on the brightside, then you floor. The gas pedal, and hit the corner fast. The more asserted, never looking back. May hit the curb. But everyday is a new learning curve. As you, steer through life. Sometimes you might not wanna swerve. But you have to, to avert a disaster. Lucky, no permanent damage. 'Cause they hurt you so bad. It's like they murdered your ass. And threw dirt on your casket. But you returned from the ashes. And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline. And while you're burning the past. Standing at inferno and chant. Standing in the flames. There's a beautiful kind of pain. Setting fire to yesterday. Find the light, find the light, find the light. Standing in the flames. There's a beautiful kind of pain. Setting fire to yesterday. Find the light, find the light, find the light. So familiarize. With what having to swallow this pill is like. It happens all the time, they take your heart. And steal your life. And it's as though you feel you've died. Because you've been killed inside. But yet you're still alive which means. You must survive. Although today you may weep because you're weak and. Everything seems so bleak and hopeless. The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in. That's the only thing keepin' you. From leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in. And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling. And with a little time that should do the healin'. And by tomorrow you may even feel so good. That you're willing. To forgive them even after. All that shit you been put through. This feeling of resilience is building. And the flames are burning. Quick as fire would through this building. You're sealed in. But your fireproof and retardant you withstood it. And as you climb up to the roof. You're just chillin' and you look down. 'Cause you're so over them you could. Put the heel of your foot through the ceilin. As time passes, things change everyday. But wounds? Wounds heal. But scars still remaining the same. But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames. Throw the match at the passed up place. So feel the fire beneath your feet. As you barely even perspire from the heat. Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief. And as you say goodbye to the grief. It's like watching the walls melt. In your prison cell. But you've extinguished this living hell. Still a little piece of you dies, you scream. Standing in the flames. There's a beautiful kind of pain. Setting fire to yesterday. Find the light, find the light, find the light. Standing in the flames. There's a beautiful kind of pain. Setting fire to yesterday. Find the light, find the light, find the light. I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn rising. A phoenix from the flames. Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight. Now it feels with these wings that I will fly. Standing in the flames. There's a beautiful kind of pain. Setting fire to yesterday. Find the light, find the light, find the light. Standing in the flames. There's a beautiful kind of pain. Setting fire to yesterday. Find the light, find the light, find the light"
believe,"And I started from the bottom. Like a snowman, ground up. Like round chuck, and still. put hands on you. Staying wound up is how I spend time. Sucker free, confidence high. Such a breeze when I pin rhymes. I just got the air about me. Like wind chimes (yeah). Another day in the life (uh). Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah). Now my community's gated. And I made it, and my neighbors say hi. (say hi). I'm giving them pounds,. I'm upscale now. Guess it means. I'm way in the sky. But I still remember the days of,. minimal wage for. General labor,. welfare recipients is a minor. Look at how government assistance has made ya. Adversity, if at first. you don't succeed. Put your temper to more use. 'cause being broke's a poor excuse. That shit only gives you more fuel. Show them why you're you. So close, God,. it's like I almost got it. But close only counts. in timebombs and horseshoes. So I uni-bomb shit (tick, tick, tick). No remorse. Screw it, I'm lit,. and that attitude I blew up on quick. That's why they call me firecracker. I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with. a short fuse. I got some important news to report to. Anyone who thought I was done,. nah, bitch, not quite. Spotlight's back on,. got my faith,. where's yours?. Do you still believe in me?. Didn't I get everything I had. to give you to make you see?. I'll never forget if you. turn your back on me. Now and walk out I will. never let you live it down. (I'll never quit). Do you still believe in me?. Man, I know sometimes these. thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice. To me, they're just ink blots. I just fling 'em like slingshots,. and so precise. So you might want to think it over twice. When you retards can roll the dice. But beef will at least cost you your career. 'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced. But this middle finger's free as a bird. Nuke warhead-ed birth,. you just forehead on Earth. Too short for a verse, studied his formula. Learned how to incorporate a curse. Point it towards corporate America. Stick a fork in it and turn. 'Cause four-letter words. are more better. Heard the world force-fed a turd to me. You're getting yours. But sometimes I overdo it. But I just get so into it. I was there consoling you. when no one knew it. When your situation showed no improvement. I was that door, you walked over to it. I'm the light at the end of tunnel. so people are always looking at me. as they're going through it. When that tunnel vision is unclear,. shit becomes too much to bear. Since ""Cleaning Out My Closet"". when I was having trouble. with the snare. I'm that unrealistic prayer answered. And I'ma get you jacked up,. like you're trying. to fix a flat (uh),. when you struggle with despair. That double fisted bear,. knuckles coupled with this. pair of nuts I'm cupping. I am your fucking switch, nothing can compare. Do you still believe in me?. Didn't I get everything. I had to give you to make you see?. I'll never forget if you. turn your back on me. Now and walk out. I will never let you live it down. (I'll never quit). Do you still believe in me?. Started from the bottom like a snowman. Oh man, put that in your. corncob pipe and smoke that. But my battery's low. I'm gonna need a booster in my pack. I know I always got Proof. on my back. I called you Proof 'cause I knew for a fact. My ace in the hole. Homie I'm calling on you. 'cause I think I'm slowly. startin' to lose faith in it, so. Give me that inkling and motivation to go. Hussein with the flow. Fake fans with the two-faced that show. Let heartbeats loot,. produce hate in my soul. Laying vocals two days in a row. True statement,. hate to go down this road. But there's only one route. to cross this bridge. So I walk in this. bitch with loose change. 'Cause all my dues paid. But this booth is taking its toll. But it's never too late. to start a new beginning. That goes for you too. So what the fuck you gon' do,. use the tools you're given?. Or are you going to use. the cards you were dealt. as an excuse for you to not. do shit with them. I used to play the loser victim. 'Til I saw the way Proof was driven. I found my vehicle and. I haven't ran out of gas yet. And when they stacked decks,. turn handicaps into assets. Fanny packs, hourglasses. If time was on my side,. I'd still have none to waste. Man, in my younger days,. that dream was so much fun to chase. It's like I run in place. while this shit dangled in front of my face. But how do you keep up the pace. and the hunger pains once. you've won the race?. When that pool exhaust is cooling off. 'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove. at all. 'Cause you done already. hit them with the coup de grâce. Still you feel the need. To go through and deal with. that Bruce Willis. That blue still, that truth still. When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will. Do you still believe?"

All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo. With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh. Sorry yo, we done both set the bar low. Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past. But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow. And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow. But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note. Oh, Marshall Mathers.

big weenie,"I don't understand. Why you're being so mean. You're a mean, mean man. CHORUS. You are just jealous of me. 'cause you, you just can't do what I do. So instead of just admitting it. You walk around and say. all kinds of really mean things. about me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie. But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me. 'cause I'm what you wanna be. So you just look like an idiot. When you say these mean things. 'cause it's too easy to see. You're really just a big weenie, big weenie. Alright listen, I need you to focus. I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is. important. We are going to perform an experiment of a sort. I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a. moment. Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes close 'em. You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis. For the next 4 and a half minutes. we are going to explore into your mind to find out why. you're so fuckin' jealous. Now why do they make you who. Pibbity-cock-a-poo-poo. Psych, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're. still listening. Okay now I need your un-divided attention. Sir I have a question. Why do I always sense this, undeniable tension?. From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all. quiet and whispers. Whenever there's conversations. why am I always mentioned?. I been dying to ask, it's been itching at me. Is it just because.... Chorus. Alright now I, I just flubbed a line. I was going to say something extremely important. but I forgot who or were what it was, I fucked up. Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't. That's just what you wanted to hear from me. is that I fucked up ain't it?. But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper. It doesn't take a bunch of takes. or me to stand here in this booth all day for me to. say the truth, ok?. You're droolin', you have tooth decay. Your mouth is open, you're disgusting. What the fuck you eat for lunch. A bunch of sweets or something, what?. You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?. Your tooth is rotten to the gum. Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?. Yes I do sir, what am I on?. You sir are on chew serum. Marshall I'm so jealous of you. Please say you won't tell nobody. I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified. That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying. All these terrible, evil and awful mean things. It's my own insecurity!. Chorus. Alright now we, we're going to conduct. That experiment that we were talking about earlier. Just to see what a frog, looks like when it takes two. hits of ecstasy. 'cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want. to check to see?. Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?. Wait, let me put these sunglasses on. Now look in this mirror, how about now?. What do you have in common?. You're both green with envy and look like idiots with. sunglasses on 'em. You look like I sound like singing about weenies. Now take my weenie out of your mouth. This is between me and you, I know you're not happy. I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of. a room somewhere crying. Curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying. There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than. yours is. Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges. Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless. Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is. tortuous. My point is this. That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink. Now I forgot what the chorus is,. your just is.... Chorus"

Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw +Is+ niggaz from Crenshaw. from Long Beach to South Central. {*Loud Scream*} Whoa, not these niggaz again. These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again. (Hehe) You and what army could harm me?. D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach. (East-syde!) Came a long way, to makin these songs play.

You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage. Gotta love it, cause I expose the facade. Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God. All jokes aside, come bounce with us. Standin over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust. It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust. I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs. So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough.

I'm just a criminal, makin a living. off of the world's misery - what in the world gives me the right. to say what I like, and walk around flippin the bird. Livin the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs. Dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave. Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me. I just want you all to notice me and people to see. that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me. It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me. is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean.

biterphobia,"Slippin in through the back door. Booty MC's get ambushed. Rammed and squooshed. Slammed and pushed. Crammed and mushed. Then I'm movin on down from the right to left. So wipe the meth and prepare to fight to death. You get jacked and tackled and cracked in two. Smack them through 'till ya black and blue. Or actin true. I'm dreaded like a man who's hair is all strands. Who's badder when sniffin on aerosol cans. I'm stompin 'em, kickin 'em, chokin 'em, stampin 'em,. clockin 'em, stickin 'em, pokin 'em, clampin 'em. Who'd elect ya kids, indict their votes. Hit 'em with vicoden doses of lighting bolts. I'm zappin, ???. Faster than you can snap your fingers for answers. Cancer is in the flesh. Alight a breather. Survived it by the knife and the thievinâ€™. I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters. It felt like I was being attacked by spiders. Developin' a fear from biterphobia. I'm holdin the gas can and lighter over ya. If I detect ya. I'ma pulverise disect ya brain. Diggin in ya skull for lies that I'm a torture. With material iller than a stark raid or mass serial killer. I'm more dangerous. Than a loaded chamber is. A major is to a plagiarist. So beware of the aura. A terror, the horror. Will scare ya tomorrow. Ze-ero?? assault for rappers. Hear the start of developin' skills. A head full of Porter. We run or gallop on hills???. The choice is yours. Decipher these noisy force minutes. Scream â€˜til my voice is hoarse. Cuz Iâ€™m sick of these debators. That grab like repertoires and saboteurs. And bite like Labradors. Hear the range of my double barrel. And your life is in danger troubled and perilled. I can't understand flyers. Second?? with camp fires. Cuz vampires bite on my balls and clamp pliers. It's swinging my big thing-a-ma-jig. So I'm ringing my neck. Proof will backup. when I sing at my gig. Cuz biters are fallin head over heels. in love. With every rhyme that I set over ears. That's how I became paranoid. Chewing my fingernails."

brain damage,"[Doctor] Scalpel. [Nurse] Here. [Doctor] Sponge. [Nurse] Here. [Doctor] Wait.. he's convulsing, he's convulsing!. [Nurse] Ah!. [Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him!. [Nurse] Oh my! Oh my God!. [Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him!. [Nurse] Oh my God!. [Eminem]. These are the results of a thousand electric volts. A neck with bolts, ""Nurse we're losin him, check the. pulse!"". A kid who refused to respect adults. Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose. A corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery. Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on. me. And I might snap, one day just like that. I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the. bike rack. (Whosssssh) My first day in junior high, this kid. said,. ""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon. you die"". I looked at my watch it was one twenty. ""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you. want from me?!?"". He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make. it worse..."". My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first. Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache it. works"". I screamed, ""Owww! My appendix feels like they could. burst!. Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!"". [N] ""What's the matter?"". [E] ""I don't know, my leg, it hurts!"". [N] ""Leg?!? I thought you said it was your tummy?!?"". [E] ""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!"".

[N] ""Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma. let him."". Chorus: repeat 2X. Brain damage, ever since the day I was born. Drugs is what they used to say I was on. They say I never knew which way I was goin. But everywhere I go they keep playin my song. [Eminem]. Brain damage... Way before my baby daughter Hailey. I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo. Bailey. An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father. boxes. so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers. One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin. And had me in the position to beat me into submission. He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my. nose,. Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my. throat. I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef"". But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I. couldn't breathe. He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honkey!"". The principal walked in (What's going on in here?). and started helpin him stomp me. I made them think they beat me to death. Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they. finally left. Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth. Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four. inch screws. Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools. ""This is for every time you took my orange juice,. or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my. chocolate milk.. Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and. spilt.. I'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good."". I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I. could. and beat him over the head with it til I broke the. wood. Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot... .. Made it home, later that same day. Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything. became gray. I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read. I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed. My mother started screamin, ""What are you on,. drugs?!?. Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!"". (Sorry!). She beat me over the head with the remote control. opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my. skull. I picked it up and screamed, ""Look bitch, what have. you done?!?"". [M] ""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"". [E] ""Shut up you cunt!"" I said, ""Fuck it!"". Took it and stuck it back up in my head. then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my. neck. Chorus. [Eminem]. Brain damage... It's brain damage... I got brain damage... It's brain damage... It's probably brain damage... It's brain damage... Brain damage... I got brain damage.."
brainless,"[Intro]. Eminem has a full line of chainsaws. Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem. Marshall Mathers, Eminem... the rapper Eminem. ""Who can say for sure?. Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer. If science could operate on this distorted brain. and put it to good use. Society would reap a great benefit."". [Verse 1]. I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets. Who's likely to become a serial killer, case of Tourettes. Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress. I make a mess as the day progresses. Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges. Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches. With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges. Imagination's dangerous, it's. The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this. situation I guess. Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's. Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous. I look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took. My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush. I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook. This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook. He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book. Now there's using your head. Momma always said. [Hook]. If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous. A brain, you'd be dangerous. I'ma prove you wrong. Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous. And I'mma be a pain in the anus. I'ma be the bomb. I'ma use my head as a weapon. Find a way to escape this insaneness. Momma always said,. ""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"". Guess it pays to be brainless. [Verse 2]. Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet. I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete. It's usually once a month, this is some feat. I've accomplished, they've stomped me into the mud,. gee for what reason, you stumped me. But how do you get the shit beat out of you. beat down and be upbeat when you don't have nothing?. No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed. Cause you're doomed from the start. it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street. But if I could just get my head out my ass. I could accomplish any task. Practicing trash talkin'. In a trance locked in my room, yeah. but I got some plans, Momma. These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket,. I can't stop it. And I'm starting to blend in more. In school this shit helps for sure. I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before. Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that. threw my first punch - end of story. Still in my skull is a vacant empty void,. been using it more as a bin for storage. Take some inventory. In this gourd there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe,. an orange, an extension cord, and a Ninja sword, not to mention. four linchpins an astringent stored. Ironing board, a bench, a wrench an oru winch. an attention whore. Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain like an. independent store. Something's wrong with my head. Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't. Cause I'd probably be Dahmer, cause Momma always said. [Hook]. If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous. A brain, you'd be dangerous. I'ma prove you wrong. Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous. And I'mma be a pain in the anus. I'ma be the bomb. I'ma use my head as a weapon. Find a way to escape this insaneness. Momma always said,. ""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"". Guess it pays to be brainless. [Bridge]. Now my Mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm. Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb. I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped. But somehow, I came out on top. [Verse 3]. I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo. I'm nice, yo, fuck it, I'm out cold. Now everywhere I go they scream out go. I'm 'bout to clean house, yo. I'm Lysol, now I'm just household. Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America,. hear 'em yell out in terror they were so scared and those kids. Just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out of my smart. aleck mouth, it was so weird. Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it. Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as. Mothafucking difficult, ch-yeah, 'til then, hopefully ya. Little homos get over your fears and phobias. It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers. 'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's. A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors,. tactical, practical jokes, yeah. You mothafuckin' (insert insult here). Who the fuck would've thunk that one little ole MC'd. Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?. And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked. This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got. That white trash traffic in gridlock, shit hopping like six blocks. From a Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-. -Tober, and God forbid I see a wizard. and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all, cause. I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said. [Hook]. If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous. A brain, you'd be dangerous. I'ma prove you wrong. Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous. And I'mma be a pain in the anus. I'ma be the bomb. I'ma use my head as a weapon. Find a way to escape this insaneness. Momma always said,. ""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"". Guess it pays to be brainless. [Outro].

Van full of ganja, now come on jump,. Man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha,. Doin? the cha cha and the kucharcha with a. Quadri-plegic,. Boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,. Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,. Who da knew the buddah do to me what?s it?s done,. Such cynicism when this isn?t in my system,. Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,. So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist. Pump,. Chris-to-pher reeves swimming in my swim trunks,. Mister, ?help me? what?s he said to me and then sunk,. Women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,. In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,. [chorus]. Once again they call me buffalo bill,. Buffalo bill, buffa-buffalo bill,. Skin em up, hym em,. Sew em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,. Upa upa up in those kilts,. Man you don?t want to go up in those hills,. Up in those hills, uppa up in those hills. You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,. Buffa-buffalo bill,. [verse 2]. Always, you can see em lurking in the hallways,. Carcasses of caucasian females in his crawl space,. How the hell did he fit em all in such a small space,. Hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall. Take,. Well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I?ll wait,. Until its dries for the moment I guess your all safe,. After I sand it and buff it I guess that I?ll paint,. My chainsaw?s outta gas my regular saw aint,. Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,. You can even hear the evil spirits coming from.

bully,"[Intro]. Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging. [Verse]. I'm withholding my anger. Though I'd like to be the strangler. Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck. It's my right to insist. That he acknowledge my existence. But he just displays complete lack of respect. That's what he says to himself. As he uses magazines to trash me. As he sits with both feet up at his desk. Smokes a bag of his weed. And starts imagining things. And he just can't see that he's manically depressed. And in his jealousy and envy. It just whirls him in a frenzy. As he turns on MTV and sees my face. He don't exist in this world. So he just twists and he twirls. Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a rage. And it's destroying him slowly. Cuz he does not even know me. Even though he sees me everywhere he goes. So he just tortures himself. He has no fortune and wealth. So he extorts someone else to get his dough. And now he's acting like a bully. So he tries to push and pull me. But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad. He has no choice but to scream. And raise his voice up at me. Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared. [Chorus]. You aint no motherfucking (bully). And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully). I won't allow it, aint no coward to no (bully). I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully). Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...). And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...). [Verse]. Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies. No more unfortunately. There's so many motherfuckers that just are. They just keep pounding at me. Now that I'm down with 50. Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja' [laughter]. But his ass is such a puppet. Irv could shove his whole hand up it. And just make him say what he wants him to say. But Suge has Irv's on a string. And Irv's so nervous that he. Says anything to this man to keep him at bay. So now Ja thinks that he's so tough. And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf. And they go huff and puff and blow our label down. But our building's made out of bricks. So you ain't taking out shit. I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown. So now you try to pull a race card. And it backfires in your face hard. Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit. Plus this guy that you fucked. When you was ecstasied up. Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch. [Chorus]. You must be taking to much (E...). [Verse]. Now what bothers me the most. About hip-hop is we so close. To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac. We just lost Jam Master J. Big L got blasted away. Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta. It's like a never-ending cycle. That just seems to come full circle. Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard. I'm not excluding myself. Cuz I been stupid as well. I been known to lose it when someone says something smart. But as we grow as men. We learn to let shit go, but then again. There's only so much bullshit we can really stand. We all got reps to uphold. When someone steps on our toes. It's no exception, it goes for every man. But if Irv really gave a fuck. About Ja like he claims he does. He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs. But he just keeps feeding him pills. So if that E doesn't kill him. Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed. Dawg, I'm talking to you straight. If the situation escalates. Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game. And if I get killed for this rap. I got a million in cash. That says I will get you back in Halie's name. [Chorus]. Irvine, get your boy off that (E...). [Spoken]. Get at me, dawg. Holla"
bump heads,"(feat. 50 Cent, G-Unit). [50 Cent]. Yeah, Shady, Hahahaha. G G G G G G G G-Unit. [Eminem]. Here we go again. [50 Cent]. Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?. You can't understand how I get my dough. 50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so. I'm on fire. Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne. I just get on the track and try to set the tone. I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone. But don't compare me. I'm better off jus' left alone. And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales. I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself. Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12. Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail. And livin wreckless. But if you go check my belt. You may see something else I used to protect myself. A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells. And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel. And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to. Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you. And I done seen a lot of people cross the line. But this motherfucker Ja musta lost his mind. That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX. Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next. So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael. Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled. We'd all much rather get along and fight you. Me and Hailie danced to your songs we liked you. And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth. C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you. I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to. But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you. Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of that shit you on. But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it. But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta. We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants to. So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk?. When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg?. How come you didn't say you had a problem then?. When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then. I'ma grown man dawg come holla. All you did was slapdance, smile and swallow,. another one of them little X pills in front of me. And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on. [50 Cent]. [Chorus]. I know you don't want it with me. You know you don't want it with me. You, talk an' you soon will see. You don't wanna bump heads with me. I know you don't want it with me. You, talk an' you soon you will see. You know you don't want it with me. [Tony Yayo]. You couldn't son me if my father helped you. My punchlines is hot, my bars'll melt you. Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you. Every other week I'm buyin a new pistol. I clap at your ass with this chrome 38. And put six thru your hats of seven 3/8. Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night. I put my knife in ya wind pipe and freeze ya on the turnpike. You know and I know who took ya chain. You got robbed two times so ya ass is laid. I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail. You betta stick to tha movies with Steven Seigel, bitch. [50 Cent]. [Chorus]. I know you don't want it with me. You know you don't want it with me. You, talk an' you soon will see. You don't wanna bump heads with me. I know you don't want it with me. You, talk an' you soon you will see. You know you don't want it with me. [Lloyd Banks]. Fuck that I'm miles away. And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand. I'ma find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man. Tellin' New York, even in Compton they understand. I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate out tha game an'.... They see me more pop a boy for icey cuz I could. Shootin' guns for money you probably forgot your way around the hood. Bitch when you paranoid it's hard to make a song. Now you want it wit' us, half your artists got to make a point. Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer picture. And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches. You don't know nuttin' about what pain is sucka. I'll put your ass to the ground like a train conductor, muh'fucker. [50 Cent]. [Chorus]. I know you don't want it with me. You know you don't want it with me. You, talk an' you soon will see. You don't wanna bump heads with me. I know you don't want it with me. You, talk an' you soon you will see. You know you don't want it with me. [Tony Yayo]. Yeah nigga yeah. Shady Aftermath G-Unit. Fuck you think they call us G Unit for. Cause we move units uhha. Don't think we ain't billin you for this motherfucking studio time."
bus a rhyme (feat. missy elliot),"[Missy] Slim Shady (4X). [Eminem]. Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled. Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed. Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode. and punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes. There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches. Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets. Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward. Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg. Comin through the airport, sluggish, walkin on crutches. Hit a fuckin [*pregnant chick*] in her [*stomach*] with luggage. It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out. Lookin for some other thug, to beat the crap out. I'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers. I flip you off in French, then translate in English. Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back. speakin so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it. [Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady. [Shady] Yeah.

business,"[Dr. Dre]. Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S.. [Eminem]. Holy wack, unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right. [Dr. Dre]. To the rapmobile, let's go!. [Lady]. Marshall! Marshall!. [Eminem]. Bitches and Gentleman, it's showtime!. Hurry, hurry step right up!. Introducing the star of our show, his name is.... [Lady]. Marshall!. [Eminem]. You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now. So without further or do, I bring to you.... [Lady]. Marshall!. [Eminem]. You're 'bout to witness hip hop in its most purest. most rawest form flow, almost flawless. most hardest, most honest, known artist. Chip off the old block but old Doc' is back. Looks like Batman brought his own Robin. Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden. wit' his on private plane, his own pilot. Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges. Oranges, peach, pears, plums syringes {*Vrrm vrrm*}. Yeah here I come. I'm inches away from you, dear fear none. Hip hop is in a state of 911 so.... CHORUS 2x. Let's get down to business. I don't got no time to play around what is this. Must be a circus in town,. let's shut the shit down on these clowns. Can I get a witness?. [Dr. Dre]. Hell yeah!. [Eminem]. Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles. Gee willikers, Dre, holy bat syllables. Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham. when I'm gone. Time to get rid of these rap criminals. So skip to your lou while I do what I do best. You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it. Flows too wet, nobody close to it. nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit. the most hated on out of all those. who say they get hated on in eighty songs. and exaggerate it all, so much they make it all up,. there's no such thing. like a female with good looks, who cooks and cleans. It just means so much more to so much more. People when you're rappin' and you know what for,. the show must go on. So I'd like to welcome y'all to Marshall and Andre's carnival,. come on! Now.... Chorus. Let's get down to business. I don't got no time to play around what is this. Must be a circus in town,. let's shut the shit down on these clowns. Can I get a witness?. [Dr. Dre]. Hell yeah!. [Eminem]. It's just like old times, the dynamic duo. Two old friends, why panic?. You already know who's fully capable, the two capped heroes. Dial straight down the center 8-0-0. You can even call collect, the most feared duet. Since me and Elton, played career Russian Roulette. And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat. People stepping over people. just to rush to the set. Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely,. ease over these beats and be so breezy. Jesus how can shit be so easy?. How can one Chandra be so Levy?. Turn on these beats MC's don't see me. Believe me, BET and MTV. are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy. Can't leave rap alone the game needs me. Till we grow beards, get weird,. and disappear into the mountains. Nothing but clowns down here. But we, ain't fucking around 'round here. Yo Dre!. [Dr. Dre]. What up?. [Eminem]. Can I get a hell?. [Dr. Dre]. Hell yeah!. Chorus. Let's get down to business. I don't got no time to play around what is this. Must be a circus in town,. let's shut the shit down on these clowns. Can I get a witness?. [Dr. Dre]. Hell yeah!. [Eminem]. So now you have it folks. [Lady]. Marshall!. [Eminem]. ... Has come to save the day. Back with his friend Andre. And to remind you that bullshit does not pay because.... [Lady]. Marshall!. [Eminem]. And Andre are here to stay and never go away. Until our dying day,. until we're old and grey. [Lady]. Marshall!. [Eminem]. So until next time friends. Same blonde hair, same rap channel. Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming. Your host for the evening.... [Lady]. Marshall!. [Eminem]. Oh, hah"
c'mon let me ride,"(And the wheels go round... and round). If you got a sweet tooth. You can taste my watermelons. If the swingset bores you. I can show you all my talents. I can wear a tan. Like others bitches can't. You can have all this, boy. And there's only one thing that I want from you. Come on, let me ride your bicycle. It's so fantastical, on your bicycle. We can get a little more physical. Baby, after all, it's only natural. I feel it comin', comin', comin'. I feel it runnin', runnin', runnin'. Come on, let me ride your bicycle. It's so fantastical, on your bicycle. You want to ride my bicycle. You want to ride my bike. If the world starts freezing. I can make it hot and humid. If you get a bee-sting. I can suck out all the poison. I can make you last. Like other bitches can't. Have I made it clear, boy?. There's only one thing that I want from you. Come on, let me ride your bicycle. It's so fantastical, on your bicycle. We can get a little more physical. Baby, after all, it's only natural. I feel it comin', comin', comin'. I feel it runnin', runnin', runnin'. Come on, let me ride your bicycle. It's so fantastical, on your bicycle. I'm only fuckin' with you. Fuck you for thinking it's true. I'm not like the sluts in this town. They make me ""blehh"" in my mouth. I wanna ride on your bike. Cause you're the boy that I like. It's like I'm a sell out for you. But your bike's so shiny and new. She's distracted, by my reflectors. Man, I can tell this chick's attracted. My wheels spoke to her. My Schwinn is a chick magnet. Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips. With a bag of prophylactics as big. As Mick Jagger lips. Shagging's, something I'm a pro at. But I ain't practicing shit. Allen Iverson of safe sex,. Condoms are for practice. Man, I skip practice. Flip backwards while I flip this bike. On its banana seat. My fantasy's to have you land. Where the kick stand is. Got this bitch gaggin', they call me the broad killer. I'm the cousin of Godzilla. Cause I spit fire and my dick's draggin'. Zig zaggin' up the avenue. Pulling these chicks in my antagonist wagon, screamin'. Come on, let me ride your bicycle. It's so fantastical, on your bicycle. We can get a little more physical. Baby, after all, it's only natural. I feel it comin', comin', comin'. I feel it runnin', runnin', runnin'. Come on, let me ride your bicycle. It's so fantastical, on your bicycle. You want to ride my bicycle. You want to ride my bike"
campaign speech,"Jumped out of the second floor of a record store. With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder. In Ecuador with Edward Norton. Witness the metamorphosis. Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman. From the Hessian war and. Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman. Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan. Endless sores and reservoir. Of extension cords in dresser drawers. And deadbolts on the bedroom doors. And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin. Excellent boyfriend. Use intercourse to settle scores. With women who have been vendettas towards men. Dickhead is forced in to the shredded foreskin. Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion. Bed sores in sore shins. Pregnant whores can get abortions. Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption. Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor. A predator, I'm headed for competitors. Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals. I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store. Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus. Yes, of course, I mess up once. You want some? Come and get some, boys!. I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course. On excessive force and pressure points. And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange. Dress and four inch heels to address the court. With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso. Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad. As a present for him. In my present form I'm Desert Storm. Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for. Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel. Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!. The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus. Met a contortionist, said, ""When you wanna get sexual? "". She said, ""However I fit in your schedule, I'm flexible. "". Expired tags on the Saturn, got Kathryn Beck. In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on. At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph. For this asshole cop's daughter. Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it. He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock. Had a heart attack and dropped dead. Started fallin' back with it. And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock. One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch. Crack for an axle. Wwalked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff. Pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel. Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*. Asked if they had a laugh in stock. That was fuckin' stupid. You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch. A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic. Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!. Like spas in this bitch, slob on it, with gobs of lipstick. Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with. It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with. She's non-existent. Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick. On some swab and slick shit. But I shout derogatives at bitches. Like fuckin' missile launches. Misfit, blond and nitwit. Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit. Screamed, ""I hate blondes"", and became one, I'm optimistic. Love to start shit. Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments. In the glove compartment. Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxx. I'm double parkin' up at Targets. Trouble 'cause a double cross. The shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across. Other than olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults. A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer. Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is. Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's. Dressin' up in your mummy costume. On stage dancin' to ""Brain Damage"", what's the problem?. Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status. Run the faucet, I'm about to dunk. A bunch of Trump supporters underwater. Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans. In a gray van with a spray tan. It's a wrap, like an Ace bandage. Don't-give-a-fuck persona. To my last Dna strand. E&J in the waistband, at the Vmas with the stagehand. She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan. Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say. Consider me a dangerous man. But you should be afraid of this dang candidate. You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet. 'Cause he runs his campaign. With his own cash for the fundin'. And that's what you wanted. A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand. On the button who doesn't have to answer to no one. Great idea!. If I was president. Gettin' off is the first order of business. Once I get in office. Second thing that'll make me happy's. Walkin' up to Uncle Sam. Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand. Screamin', ""Fuck safe sex"". Throw a latex and an Aids test at him. Tell Congress I run this land. And I want the rubber banned and make it snappy. Addiction to friction and static. Addict who can't escape the habit. It's in you to chase the dragon. But as fate would have it I walked up in major Magics. Dressed as the maintenance man. In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket. With a gauge to blast it. And sped away in the station wagon. Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's. Crazy asses in the backseat. Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me. Dead passenger in the passenger seat. Unfasten the safety latches. And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard. I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires. Finna get a murder case and catch it. Like you threw it at me. Encased in plastic. And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz. Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'. Like a windmill with a thin bill. While his skin's peelin'. And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar. Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder. Knock it into the upper peninsula. You want to go against zilla? The Rap God. When will I quit? Never been realer. The in-stiller of fear. Not even a scintilla of doubt. Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla. Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller. Revenge killer of bin syllable binge. Fill a syringe, till I. Draw first blood. Even pop shit on my pop shit. And it's popular. Couldn't be more awkwarder. Cause you're innocence I robbed you of. It's my fingers that got stuck up. Tortured a, not give a. Slapstick, hockey puck. The broad hunter with the sawed off. Like an arm when it's lopped off. But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun. Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox. Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen. It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker. The rock cuts into rock cause who would have thought. This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks. Of Vivica Fox with a box cutter. That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned. I'm unrevealing quickly. My squabbles, I'm grappling. With your time traveling with me. Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history. With a flask of the whiskey. Tip it back then. I'm twisting wine bottles. Like what happened to Chris Reeves spine column. That's the plan of attack. When I'm fixing my problems. Wish my chest wasn't having. To get these rhymes off 'em. But the fact that I have so many rappers against me. Mind boggles. And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me. More of a spectacular mystery. Than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel. But my patience is wearing thin. Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit. In your face till I smear it in. Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen. And never appear again. If you actually had fucking careers to end. But then I think of Molly Qerim. And I steer'em in that direction. And forget my ideas for them. Molly, I'm gone off you. Man, light some kush. You're my first take, I'll nail you. Can't lie, I gush. If I won you over, you would be the grand prize. I'm entranced by your looks. Come and give the Shady franchise a push. You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch. Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush. Mushed against your damn side, you puss. And thighs are squooshed. What kind of attires that?. I'm ready to be rode. Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping. Like a flat. Light the match to ignite the wrath. Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half. Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me. Like a scab. Hard to describe in fact. Startling violent perhaps. Are things that come to mind. As soon as I start spitting rhymes like that. And you aren't really surprised at that. But as far as these lines I rap. And these bars, wouldn't dial it back. If I star 69'ed the track. Why am I such a dick?"
can i bitch,"""Can-i-bitch"". Eminem. ""Straight From The Lab"" EP. (2003). [Intro]. {in a high falsetto voice}. Uncle Marshall!. Will you tell us a bedtime story?. {regular voice}. Here we go.... [Verse One]. Now once upon a time not long ago. There was a little rapper about to blow. But his album came and it was not good. I think it went lead or double copper wood. So the silly little fans they were mislead. By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head. ""Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash. Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"". Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to. The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer. To this little ass-kissin' vaginal blister. 'Stanabis', little Marshall Mathers' sister. And in this corner, we have the mister. Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister. Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for. This little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'. Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor. I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Kennif-sta. You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya. Cannabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!. [Chorus]. Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch. Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?. Please tell me what happened with. That style that you were rappin' with. Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch. Are you from Los Angeles,. New York or just a janitor. From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch.. . Now at first I ain't really understand the shit. Picture me for a second and imagine it. Chillin' in a Bat-Mansion and relaxin'. When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanner. It's Can-i-bitch with some Stan Lives shit. They greet me out at first man this is sick. For me being just a sick disconflict. Gets my dick harder than arithmetic. And I know how you jealous ones envy. I should'a knew better from the first few letters you sent me. The first two letters you were tellin' me shit. Like you respect me, like any other regular MC. The third letter you ask how come I ain't return. None of the messages at Shady Records You Left Me. The fourth Letter: ""Slim you really startin' to upset me!"". The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me. The sixth threat there's a bomb threat in our building. This crazy mother-fucker's really tryin' to kill me!. So I went back and read the first few letters that said. Some shit about a message you left. Oh shit, that's not an ""E"" that's an ""A"". This dude wants to leave me a ""massage,"" he's gay!!. Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre. We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way). [Chorus]. . So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib. The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives. And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship. Shit oh Dre wait a minute that's it. All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost. We can fly over the border ""Let's go"" *WOOSH!*. So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed. *BOOSH!* (What was that?) oh Jermaine Dupre. Fuck it, keep goin' no time to waste. Wait, backup hit him one more time in case. Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car. Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles. Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate. Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate. And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine'. ""He couldn't have fell off that hard!"" ain't no way. ""What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous. The Canibus turned into a television evangelist"". Plus he raps with his regular voice {*BOOSH!*} {*BOOSH!*}. {*BOOSH!*} {*BOOSH!*} (what was that?) Pet Shop Boys. So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted. His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted. He kind of smelled a little like Courtney Love. I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done. So I stapped him twice, kept jabbin', Christ. He won't die this guy's like a battered wife. He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more. But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw. Hold up 'bis quit foldin' up!. Punch me in the chest make my shoulders touch!. DO SOMETHIN'! At least one punch line. C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-9!. Say 90 percent of my fans are blonde. 'bis c'mon answer me man respond!!!. Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars. Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!. Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoirs Dogs. Bite ANOTHER line from Redman's song!. Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm. from a midget reaches out from under the car.. It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither,. Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of Ether. We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again. (Compton!) Detroit bitch talk some shit again!!. STOMP HIM! (switch feet) STOMP HIM! (switch again!). Dre, alright he's dead dog, quit kickin' him!. I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again. (Damn...) he disappeared, yo he's gone, he did it again!. [Chorus]"
careful what you wish for,"[Verse 1]. So this is it.... This is what I wished for. Just isn't how I envisioned it. Fame to the point of imprisonment. I just thought the shit'd be different. But something changed. The minute that I got a whiff of it. I started to inhale it. Smell it. Started sniffin' it. And it became my cocaine. I just couldn't quit. I just wanted a little bit. Then it turned me (in)to a monster. I became a hypocrite. Concert after concert. I was raking in the dough. Rolling in green. Had the game hemmed up. Like a sewing machine. But I was losing my freedom. There was no where for me. To not go and be seen. And just go and be me. And there was no in-between. You either loved it or hate it. Every Cd critics gave it a 3, then 3. Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it. And call the Slim Shady Lp the greatest. The Marshall Mathers was a classic. The Eminem Show was fantastic. But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it. I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet. A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic. And eight years later, I'm still at it. Divorce, re-married. A felon. A father. Sleeping pill addict. And this is real talk. I feel like the Incredible Hulk. My back has been broke, and I can still walk. [Chorus]. So be careful what you wish for. 'Cause you just might get it. And if you get it then you just might not know. What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just. Come back on you ten-fold. I said. Be careful what you wish for. 'Cause you just might get it. And if you get it then you just might not know. What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just. Come back on you ten-fold. [Verse 2]. I got a letter from a fan, that said. He's been praying for me. Every day and for some reason. It's been weighing on my mind heavy. 'Cause I don't read every. Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but. Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?. You didn't pray for me when I was local. And as I lay these vocals. I think of all the shit I had to go through. Just to get to where I'm at. I've already told you at least. A thousand times in these rhymes. I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got. God on my side. And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?. Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint. Man, boy's got to look. Nuts. And that's the only word I can think of right now. On how. To describe the shit. This is like a vibe you get. Go ahead and bob to it. Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit. [Chorus]. So be careful what you wish for. 'Cause you just might get it. And if you get it then you just might not know. What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just. Come back on you ten-fold. I said. Be careful what you wish for. 'Cause you just might get it. And if you get it then you just might not know. What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just. Come back on you ten-fold"
castle,"I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne. I'm sorry, we're alone. I wrote my chapter. You'll turn the page when I'm gone. I hope you'll sing along. This is your song. I just want you to know that I ain't scared. Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared. To do whatever, to do whatever. December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie. This is your song. You'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon. I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you. I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy. That's all that matters for the time being. But obviously, assuming you will be, just thinking ahead. I'ma make it if it kills me. Let's see how far I can take it with this music. I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion. Sorry for sloppy writing. The pen in my hand's shaking, please excuse me. Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited. If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em. With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm. As I'm using in this letter maybe they can feel me as I'm. Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl. For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl. Welcome to mom and dad's crazy world. Love, daddy. Maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup. I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne. I'm sorry, we're alone. I wrote my chapter. You'll turn the page when I'm gone. I hope you'll sing along. This is your song. I just want you to know that I ain't scared. Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared. To do whatever, to do whateverdecember 1st, 1996, dear Hailie. You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got. Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are. Sorry for that, a little minor mishap. But you'll grow into 'em baby. I'm on the grind now. I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios. While I'm tryna keep the lights on. Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?. I just keep steering. I'm gonna turn into someone. I haven't the slightest clue what I'm gonna do if it falls through. You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon. My Infinite Cd flopped, too many soft tunes. They're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too. Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh. I think I might have just stumbled onto something new. Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping it's you. Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true. I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne. I'm sorry, we're alone. I wrote my chapter. You'll turn the page when I'm gone. I hope you'll sing along. This is your song. I just want you to know that I ain't scared. Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared. To do whatever, to do whatever. December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie. Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain. A lot's happened in between 'em, since I rised to this fame. I've said your name but always tried to hide your face. This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you but damn. I never knew it'd be like this. If I did I wouldn't have done it. You ain't asked for none of this shit. Now you're being punished?. Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public. I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it. I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it. One-hundred percent finished. Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it. Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know. That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold. And, if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote as a goodbye note. 'Cause your dad's at the end of his rope. I'm sliding down a slippery slope. Anyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepy. Love dad. Shit, I don't know"
celebrity,"[Verse 1 - Lloyd Banks]. I just touched down - Ferrari-to-concrete. I ain?t even home when they?re talking about me. Fuck out my ear if you talking about ""free"". Nigga, free don't pay the bills. I'm ballin all-out, B. These rappers don't know me. Nah, I ain?t your homey. If your name ain't Em, Ferrari or Tony. I like my wheel chromey. My Bentley, my Rolly. My Magnum, my phonie. South Jamaica shawty. These slugs I took in the gut, yo. The work's still here, I'm just cooking it up slow. Clear my mind and whipping the truck low. You?re looking for trouble. I pop death. You?re looking to a sun dawg. If rap ain't work, I be pimpin' on some ho. Still eating lobster and shrimp in the Bungalow. I'm back like crack over the drum roll. You know - wherever I go the gun go. [Hook - Akon]. We on the grind. All the time. Ain't 'bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine. I keep a nine. To see the shine. I might let your ass slide this time. While I get this paper. Cause I?m a celebrity. Ghetto-celebrity. Ain't nothing changed nigga. [Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]. The media will test ya, popularity is pressure. Porche Panamera platinum, hammer through the metal. Wreck a booth up, I'm too tough. That inner-city grammar, step your jewels up. They bruised up, I'll sparkle for the camera. Harsh reality's what pulls them. And holding them back from opening. Verbal attack all over these niggas. Push the herd to the back. I'm the kind that they prey on. Spending half of they day on. Lay on niggas for days, the shots spray on. My sound system knock and it pound 2Pac. 6 4 jumping like the ground too hot. They spot me, they chase a nigga down two blocks. Two shots in the air for niggas that ain't here. Two tone, two door, grey top, blue floor. Green guap galore, in and out of new hall. That bright light you saw was a paparazzi flash. I?m tryna snap a picture through your Maserati glass. [Hook]. [Eminem]. There are enough insults in my head to fill up a swear jar. And have it overflowing. So don't get me going: don't dare start. You'll never see me again: Amelia Earhart. I'm popping a wheelie, off to a really unfair start. I'm past grinding, for me - guess I just be grounded up. Like Ground Round or a pound of chuck. Tightly-wound as fuck. Till the Fire Marshalls come shut. Fire Marshall down and up. I suggest you better shut the fuck up. And stop fucking around and duck!. I ain't playing this time, I told you I'm out for blood. So to say I ""keep it 100"" would probably sound redundant. Like calling a bitch a ho. Or asking a gal to suck and blow on your big cock. Is she up to screw or down to fuck?. It's a man's world and I'm trapped in a land of smut. With a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled. Running through a house of mutts. In other words, I'm shutting every one of you bitches' mouths up. And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt!. And ain't shit changed, my shit still don't stink, player. My farts may have gotten staler ever since. I became a trailer park celebrity. Maybe my complexion became a little paler. Poster child for white trash. I'm a Garbage Pail Kid sailor, yeah. See me? I'm all up in your bitch means I'mma rape her. All I got for these hoes is dick, duct tape and a stapler. So bitch, you better look for table scraps to scrape up. I don't subscribe to the News of the Free Press. But homie, I get the paper!. ...fucking stupid. [Develdiii]"
chemical warfare,"You are now listening to the sounds of...Shady and...Alchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist. Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags. Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged. Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh. Couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser. Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers. The governor of Alaska, She lusts when I ask her. To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh. While we hover over Nebraska. Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture. In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster. She's screaming ""Grab my titties, Shady suck on those bastards"". But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after. I'm a gigolo, But Ya'll look like the juggalo rapper. Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper. Shit, Back down. Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum. And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra. While I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissors with Oprah. While Rosey pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa. Get a boner and play dick swords with the Jonas Brothers. Your mother fucking mothers are roamers, Like no other. I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's. Its chemical warfare, Drop bombs like sadam. I'm bringing the drama, Like Barrack Obama. Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octo Mama. I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas. For chemical warfare. [Develdiii]"
chloraseptic (ft. phresher),"Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah). To the English language. With this ink. You haters get rode on like a piece of paper.

Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul. That's why you sound so shook. Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat. Hook it inside your mouth, go-hruh. That's what it's like when the mic is out.

Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison. Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it. (Like what?) Like a real thin joint it. (What?) Comes on Quilted Northern. (And what?) In a built-in toilet. (Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof). I wouldn't heal with ointment. Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails. Should write a children's storybook (yeah). Million voices in my head. But still get a little bit of thrill. And some real enjoyment. (Off what?) Off the feel of going in. (Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain. Like she thinks I'm dumb. Grabs the crown of my dick. And blows me to kingdom come. 'Til I feel anointed. She makes iller noises. When she's with me, must be from the Windy City. Pretty apparent. She's a Milf when blowin' me. 'Cause I conned her into. Rippin' the condom in two (woo!). Dick is a bargainin' tool. Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins. Rude Jude. I go there, you wouldn't. Well, I still have a few views. In common with you. Just not Youtube, 'cause. I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic. And you got strep. I'm too complex with, 'plex with.

It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant. With a Tec-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah!). Now watch me set it like correct time. All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex. I Clock rejects into the next life. Talking reckless, but it's just my. Strongest suit, but you can get my. Colombian necktie. Prostitute. just climb in the Humvee and let's ride. Why you hitching at night?. I put an end to your life, sex crime. Kidding aside, insidious vibe. Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes. But all you're getting is bribed. Any old lie to try to get you inside. Then we gon' end up spending the night. And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe. What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck. Finds a slut, tries to surprise her. Cuffs, ties her up. Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?. But the muff diver must just like it rough. Fuck right in her vagina, blood. Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh. (Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie. Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi. And have a loosey-goosey. As Cool C is with an Uzi. But I am to rap what blue jeans mean. To Bruce Springsteen. Glued we be, I'm trutv. You're too Pg. I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!. No diss there, just notice there. Are no similarities that we share. Besides the fact we breathe air. Happily married to rap. And I'm glad that we buried. The hatchet and patched it up. Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack.

cleanin' out my closet,"Where's my snare?. I have no snare on my headphones. There you go, yeah, yo yo. Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?. I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against. Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times. Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind. All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'. Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'. Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'. Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'. Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth. See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out. Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now. Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now. I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry. But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha"". I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it. So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it. I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73. Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD. I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months. My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch. 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye. No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die. I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side. Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her. At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes. But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today. What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb. But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun. 'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both. It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show. I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha"". Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition. Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'. But put yourself in my position, just try to envision. Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen. Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'. Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't. 'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?. Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?. So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?. But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely. And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony. And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral. See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong. Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom. But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get. You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit. Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?. Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!. I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"""
closed doors (feat. nicki minaj ),"This time for the relapse. This room it feels lonely. Guess i was the only. The only damm fool to get caught in the trap. Feels like a slap. Disrespected the slim shady code. Back in my real mode. Nothing will stop me from the recovery. My life is a discovery. When they left me out do dry. But what the fuck they go and cry. And now im back in the waiting room. I nearly fuckin fell to my doom. Now you are the one that will pay. But my life might not have another day. So i sit in this room. With these words in my head. Im dying and i will never come back. Im closing my eyes. But they gonna make me walk again. And i can be the slim shady man. God just wont let me in. And i just wait there under these closed doors. Under these fuckin closed doors. Seriously. What the hell were you thinking. You made me be something im not. But now im coming in. And i will break your damm door down. And then little pig ill slice your throat. You will bow down to my mercy when i take over. This game feels harder. But i lever up and get stronger. You can never feel the way i feel. Cause im feeling like crap. Not popular and stupid and the jerk in the trash. Yeah that was the old me. But honestly it wasnt the real me. The real me was inside me. But you captured it and left it on your balcony. You gonna get what you deserved all these years. So i sit in this room. With these words in my head. Im dying and i will never come back. Im closing my eyes. But they gonna make me walk again. And i can be the slim shady man. God just wont let me in. And i just wait there under these closed doors. Under these fuckin closed doors. [Nicki minaj]. Why did i get myself into the situation. Im a jersey shore im a total party. Part pretty, part perfect im a complete package. I get phone calls from guys in every nation. My secret was some fairy dust. Got it from tinker bell. Traded it for a golden globe. Im the bomb diggity. Yep the only everything. Yes yes yes i am. You cant catch me im the greatest deal.. So i sit in this room (room). With these words in my head (do it). Im dying and i will never come back (never). Im closing my eyes (closing). But they gonna make me walk again (again). And i can be the slim shady man (dre). God just wont let me in (im bad). And i just wait there under these closed doors (closed). Under these fuckin closed doors (closed)"
cocaine (ft. jazmine sullivan),"[Chorus]. Got to have it,. Yeah I made it. I'm addicted. [Eminem - Verse 1]. This was a beat with no words at first, it's a blank painting. Exercising the mind, it's brain strength training. Starts off something like shady's an insane maniac. Yeah slim shady that's a zany name aint it. Now all you needs an image to go with the name, baby. Wife beaters and white t-shirts. Hanes mainly, it's a long shot but is it possible. There's a lane maybe,. If not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he. He wants the fame so bad he can taste it. He can see his name up in lights. Women screaming his f-cking name feinting. Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium. Joe Shmoe made it, he took his plain Jane lady. And his baby Hailey out the trailer. But he aint trailing anymore he's ahead of the race. While maintaining his innocence. Little does he know his train is derailing. And he's about to be raped by this game anally.. [Chorus]. Got to have it,. Yeah I made it. I'm addicted. [Eminem - Verse 2]. You're operating on all cylinders. Syllables spit like dillingers. Spilling your guts. People are feeling your mic skills. But these haters are ice grillin' ya. Willing to sacrifice anything for the life thye might steal from ya. Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya. But you can't decipher why for the life of ya. It wasn't like this when you were cyphering. Argue with your ife again. She found vicodin in your pants last night again. Your disputes public. Nothings private anymore. When your best friends say bye bye to him. What kind of apple you take a bite of slim. (But this is what you wanted Marshall aint it). F-ck no, the way that it turned out. Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head. Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it. The game stripped me naked. It robbed me of ever having another real relation-ship. With another girl, this World is a f-cking trip. As I slip in another world. Proceed, take another hit. Sniff til I f-cking url. Tell em all to f-cking sit and spin til they f-cking twirl. Middle finger up again. Relapsing back in this game, oh well, f-ck it then. [Chorus]. Got to have it,. Yeah I made it. I'm addicted"
cold wind blows,"(Intro). Cause some things just don't change. It's better when they stay the same. Althought the whole world knows your name. So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game. Ooooohhhhhhh. It shouldn't be difficult to explain. Just why you came back again, you hate the fame. Love the game, cold as ice you remain. Fuck em' all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again. So, god damn... is it that time again already. Haha, you don't look too happy to see me. Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once. All right, fuck ya'll then. (Verse 1). You can get the dick, just call me the ballsac, I'm nuts. Michael Vick in this bitch dog, fall back you mutts. Fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy. Fuck it a sick duck, I'm on my duck sick mummy. And my nuts, lick, gobble 'em up trick, yummy. Bitch you don't fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?. You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey. Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny!. Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words. You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker. Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker. Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cock sucker. This shit is on, cause you wen't and pissed me off. Now I'm sitting and pissing on everbody. give a fuck if it's right or wrong. So buck the buddah, light a bong. But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon. (Chorus). Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows. When it snows and it's twenty be-low. Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know. I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows. Oh oh oh oh oh. (Verse 2). Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth. Ya'll are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing. I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out. Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker. I'll show you pussy footin, I'll kick a bitch in the cunt. Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion. Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy. Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom. Go ahead, fucking hater push me. I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me. Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy. Man the fuck up sissy, G's up. All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!). Man chill, nah I can't god damnit. Rappers are land fill, drop the anvil. These are shoes that you can't fill. Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning. And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still. During an earthquake, urine in your face. Cause you're fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!. Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening. Alright then I quit, god I give up. Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do. This is for your sins, I cleanse you. You can repent but I warn you, if you continue. To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows. When it snows and it's twenty be-low. Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know. I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows. Oh oh oh oh oh. (Verse 3). How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day. til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say. So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs. Like i miss the pass when I went long. If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong. Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song. Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women. When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming. Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so. So don't compare me to them other bums over there. It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah. I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair. But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you. I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune. That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme. And say I was writing this and I thought of you so. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows. When it snows and it's twenty be-low. Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know. I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows. Oh oh oh oh oh. (Outro). Oh oh oh oh oh oh. I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way. I don't know, I don't know by I probably be this way til my dying day. I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold beat bangs, I don't need to say. I guess this is how you made me"
come on in,"Good mornin. Haha, wake your mother fuckin arses up. Yo what is the what?. Well come on then, you know what time it is. Stop sleepin on my roof bitch. For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped. Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished. I just can't get past these little pissants. That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad. And they so mad they can't stand it. Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk). And they can't handle it like a man. And that's when it just happens. And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?. Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit. Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion. Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin. Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now. But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic. Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it. Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me. You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit B. These words stick to you like crazy glue. When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!. I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone. Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!). I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an. Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an. Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an. Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin. Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin. So up an sing along with the words to the song an. If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an. Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in. Everybody come on an. [Swifty]. ?? the media pitted me of a beef starter. In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one. Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun. Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run. The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious. In a house full of dog shit,. I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin. You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin. It ain't about what you readin. When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins. Either that or we'll be beefin free when. You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!. Your leader is a botique bitch. Keep the heater where you can reach quick. I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret. ****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient. When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan. You brave?. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an. Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an. Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an. Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin. Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin. So up an sing along with the words to the song an. If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an. Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in. Everybody come on an. [Kuniva]. Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us. But so what this beef is like. 'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'. I can see that he's just a punk. I mean these niggas squeeze on me. Please I'm seeing guts. I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks. Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you. In front of every reporter that I don't like. No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write. So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"". I might as well give this up like heavy sales. And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt. We can't self destruct. I've never felt it this much. Come on fellas, get up. We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life. [Kon Artis]. I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip. I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith. Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick. We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit. You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's. But the only thing you shoot is the breeze. I can't believe you speaking on movin key's. But every time we hear you kick it. The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets. I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack. So when they bust you better bust back. And get your guts clapped outa your stomach. And when they want it (yeah). I bring a hundred niggas from runave. So get your gun and if you comin. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an. Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an. Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an. Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin. Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin. So up an sing along with the words to the song an.

crazy in love,"You always thought that I was doing alright. But nothing that was through a night. But I'm crazy over you. Crazy on you. Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu. Can't you see what you do to me baby?. You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.. I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick. You truly are the only one who can do this to me. You just make me get so crazy.. I go skitzo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic. One minute I want to slit your throat. The next I want sex.. You make me crazy,. The way we act like 2 maniacs in the sac. We fuck like 2 jackrabbits. And maybe that's a bad habit.. Cuz the next day we're right back at it. In the same exact pattern. What the fuck is the matter with us. We can't figure out if it's. Lust or it's love. What's sad is what's attracting us to each other. They say that every man grows up. To marry his own mother.. Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch. But I stay and still stick it out with you. Even though I just hit you today. But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you. Just cuz I came home late last night. Crawled in bed and I woke you.. But if there's one thing about you I admire its, baby,. Because you stay with me,. Maybe, because you're as crazy as I am. Cuz when I look at you. I can see an angel in your eyes. But if I look deeper inside. I see your freakish little side.. Like a devil in disguise,. You're always full of surprises. Always pullin' devises. Out your personal vibrators and dildos. You fucked yourself so much. You barely feel those anymore. You're only 24 but you're plenty more now.. Sure than those other little hoes. Who just act like little girls. Like they're in middle school still. You're crazy sexy cool, chillin. You play your position. You never step out of line. Even though I stay in your business. You've always kept out of mine.. I wonder whats on your mind. Sometimes they say love is blind. Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye. You ain't see a sign.. Or maybe you did. Maybe you like me and stuff. Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove. Crazy on you. Crazy on you. Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu. You're the ink to my paper. Where my pen is to my pad. The moral, the very fiber. The whole substance to my rap.. You are my reason for being. The meaning of my existence. If it wasn't for you. I would never be able to spit this. These sentences I do wit me I am me. Is you rely on me as much. As I rely on you to inspire me like you do.. You provide me the lighterfluid to fuel my fire. You're my entire supply gas, the match, the igniter.. The only way that I am able to stay so stable. Is you're the legs to my table. If you were to break I'd fall on my face.. But I'm always going to make you feel. I don't need you as much as I really need you. So you don't use it to your advantage.. But you're essential to me. You're the air I breathe. I believe if you ever leave me. I'd probably have no reason to be.. You are the kim to my marshall. You're the slim to my shady. The dre to my eminem. The elaina to my hailey.. You are the word I am looking for when. I'm trying to describe how I feel inside. And the right one just won't come to my mind.. You're like the pillar that props me up. The beam that supports me. The bitch who never took half,. The wife who never divorced me.. You're like the root to my evil. You let my devil come out me. You let me beat the shit out you. Before you beat the shit out me.. And no matter how much. Too much is never enough. Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove. I'm crazy on you. Crazy over you. Let me go crazy crazy over youuuuuuuuu. .

criminal,"[Eminem]. A lot of people ask me.. stupid fuckin questions. A lot of people think that.. what I say on records. or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life. or that I believe in it. Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that... I'm actually gonna do it. or that I believe in it. Well, shit.. if you believe that. then I'll kill you. You know why?. Cuz I'm a. Criminal. Criminal. You god damn right. I'm a Criminal. Yeah, I'm a Criminal. [Eminem]. My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge. That'll stab you in the head. whether you're a fag or lez. Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest. Pants or dress - hate fags? The answer's ""yes"". Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic. Starin at my jeans, watchin my genitals bulgin (Ooh!). That's my motherfuckin balls, you'd better let go of em. They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of em. Hey, it's me, Versace. Whoops, somebody shot me!. And I was just checkin the mail. Get it? Checkin the 'male'?. How many records you expectin to sell. after your second Lp sends you directly to jail?. C'mon!-- Relax guy, I like gay men. Right, Ken? Give me an amen (Aaa-men!). Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus. Heal this child, help us destroy these demons. Oh, and please send me a brand new car. And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital. Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher. You can't reach me, my mom can't neither. You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause. I watch Tv, and Comcast cable. and you ain't able to stop these thoughts. You can't stop me from toppin these charts. And you can't stop me from droppin each March. with a brand new cd for these fuckin retards. Duhhh, and to think, it's just little ol' me. Mr. ""Don't Give A Fuck,"" still won't leave. Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2x). I'm a Criminal. Cuz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime. to tell em what's on my mind - I guess I'm a Criminal. but I don't gotta say a word, I just flip em the bird. and keep goin, I don't take shit from no one. [Eminem]. My mother did drugs - tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed. The baby came out - disfigured, ligaments indeed. It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she. Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me. I'm a Criminal - an animal caged who turned crazed. But how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised?. So as I got older and I got a lot taller. My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger. I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker. than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word .... My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral. Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk. Off of his own employee. Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me. You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired. and my nose is pointy. I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die. in plane crashes and laughs. As long as it ain't happened to him. Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em. -inem and Kim combined - *kch* the maniac's in. Replacin the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today. He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin his place. (Mm-mm-mmm!) Oh, that's Dre with an Ak to his face. Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place. I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away. I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?. I'm a Criminal. [Interlude Skit]. Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker. get the motherfuckin money and get the fuck up outta there. [Em] Aight. I'll be right here waitin on you. [Em] Aight. Yo Em. [Em] What?!.

[Teller] Don't kill me, please don't kill me.... [Eminem] I said I'm not gonna fuckin kill you. Hurry the fuck up! {*Boom*} Thank you!. [Eminem]. Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it. So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it. So I'll be disguised in it. And if anybody identifies the guy in it. I'll hide for five minutes. Come back, shoot the eyewitness. Then fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business. Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets!. Cause Puffy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet. If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts. tuck my dick inbetween my legs and cluck. You motherfuckin chickens ain't brave enough. to say the stuff I say, so this tape is shut. Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up. To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass. And if it's not a rapper that I make it as. I'ma be a fuckin rapist in a Jason mask. (Chorus 2x)"
cum on everybody (feat. dina rae),"[Girl] Hmm-hmm-hmhmhmmhm.. ahhh, whooooo!! Shit. [Em] Yo, mic check. Testing one, two, um... twelve. (whattup whattup whattup.. Outsidaz). [Em] This is my dance song (Outsidaz). Can you hear me?. (Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee). [Em] Aight, ay turn my headphones up. (bust it bust it). [Eminem]. My favoite color is red, like the blood shed. from Kurt Cobain's head, when he shot himself dead. Women all grabbin at my shishkabob. Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve. (I can't stand white people!). You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so. Shit I got full blown Aids and a sore throat. I got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}. I'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show. (Yo can you sign this right here?). I just remembered that I'm absent minded. Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it. I'm freestylin every verse that I spit. cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (umm, one two). I told the doc I need a change in sickness. and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis. Put my Lp on your Christmas gift list. You wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this. Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8x). [Eminem]. Yo.. yo yo yo yo. I tried suicide once and I'll try it again. That's why I write songs where I die at the end. Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck. and I was wavin it at everybody screamin, ""I suck"" (I Suck!!!). I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd. and yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now"". Fuck rap, I'm givin it up y'all, I'm sorry. (But Eminem this is your record release party!). I'm bored out of my gourd -- so I took a hammer. and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford. Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard. who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all). One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet. I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage. (ohhhhhhh) And if you ever see a video for this shit. I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit. Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8x). [Eminem]. Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit. Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy {*wolf whistle*}. So I told em I was Mike D. They was like, ""Gee I don't know, he might be!"". I told em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert. I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)"". Then I jetted to the weed house. Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles. Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick. Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick (*slurping*}. Made a couple of crank calls collect [*brrrrrrring, click*]. ""Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"". I wanna make songs all the fellas dub. And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of. So just remember when I bomb your set. Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset. Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (20x)"

Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy. Slit the wrist of little sis. After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick. because he wanted me to fuck him from the back. but Smalls don't get down like that. Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom. Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound. Who you think you're dealin with?. Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it!. Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy. Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me. I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen. The black demon, got the little hookers screamin.

deja vu,"[Intro]. Dmc, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive. Possible overdose, substance unknown,. Pulse is sixty and thready. Respiration's eight, he's intubated and we're baggin' him now. Bp, ninety over palp,. Patient is cool, pale and diaphoretic. Has aspirated, Gsc is three,. We'll update en route, Eta, ten minutes. [Verse 1]. As I fall deeper into a manic state. I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug outta trate. The blood pressure climbs to a dramatic rate. I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nyquil than I salivate. Start off with the Nyquil with like I think I will just have a taste. Couple of sips of that than I gradually graduate. To a harder prescription drug called valium like yah thats great. I go to just take one than I end up like having eight. Now I need something in my stomach because I haven't ate. Maybe ill grab a plate of nachos and ill have a steak. And you'd think with all I have at stake. Look at my daughters face. Mommy something is wrong with dad I thank. Hes acting weird again. He''s really beginnings to scare me. Won't shave his beard again. And he pretends that he doesn''t hear me. And all he does eat dorritos and cheetos and he just. Fell asleep in his car eating three muskateers in the rear seat. [Chorus]. Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know. It feels like ive been down this road before. So lonely and cold it's like something takes over me. As soon as I go home and close the door. God feels like déjà vu I wanna get away from this place I do. But I cant and I won't say I try but I know it's a lie. cause I don't and why I just don't know. [Verse 2]. ""Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?"". That's the devil in my ear. I been sober a fuckin' year. And that fucker still talks to me. He's all I can fuckin' hear. ""Marshall, come on we'll watch the game,. It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"". And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half buzzed. For half of the time, who's the mastermind behind that little line. With that kind of rationale man I got. half a mind. To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine. Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol. Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch - I'm 'bout to fall. I missed the couch and down I go lookin' like a bouncy ball. Shit musta knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all. Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I. Man, fuck am I hungover and goddamn I. Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I. All systems ready for take off, please stand by. [Chorus]. Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know. It feels like ive been down this road before. So lonely and cold it's like something takes over me. As soon as I go home and close the door. God feels like deja vu I wanna get away from this place I do. But I cant and I won't say I try but I know it's a lie. Cause I don't and why I just don't know. [Verse 3]. So I take a Vicodin, splash it hits my stomach then, ahhhh. Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm. Gettin' high. Now I need it just not to feel sick,. Yeah I'm gettin' by. Wouldn't even be taking this shit if Deshaun. didn't die. Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use. There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through. It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducin' a snooze. What else is new, fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes. Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse. Just get high until the kids get home from school, holmes, relax. And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac. I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps. Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see. That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium, three. And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep. Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he. Has taken four years to just put out an album, B. See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath. Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing?. It was bologna, was it the methadone ya think?. Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos. Your Vcr tape cases, with your Ambien Cr. Great places to hide 'em, ain't it?. So you can lie to Hailie. I'm goin' beddy bye Whitney baby, good night Alaina. Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in. an ambulance. They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn.... [Chorus]. Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know. It feels like ive been down this road before. So lonely and cold it's like something takes over me. As soon as I go home and close the door. God feels like deja vu I wanna get away from this place I do. But I cant and I won't say I try but I know it's a lie. Cause I don't and why I just don't know"
desperados,"[Proof]. Yo, aiyo turn the heads and the mics up. We got the Dreadknaughts, you know wha' I'm sayin'?. Super MC, ya know wha' I mean?. Bugz, Dirty and all that, all that shit. You know wha' I'm sayin'?. Desperados with the cars, Eminem. [Eminem]. Chauvinist pig, drove in this Big Lincoln. Till it went over the bridge. Jumped out and dove in the ditch. Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and fridge. Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids. I'ma go for your mids. Here's a body blow for your ribs. While you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch. I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib. Unless she told me a fib. Then I'ma have both of ya dead. Burning incense, facing a murder sentence. Under intent, for investigation for killing infants. While I sit in padded rooms doing shrooms. Having visions of dead pregnant women wit' brooms jammed in they wounds. Slit your carpet and rugs, and fucked your apartment up. Sticking up all the drugs, and jumping in garbage trucks. I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps. Give you a kidney punch, and mug you to get me lunch. See me every summer, layin' up against the dumpster. With a one hundred dollar jumper, smothered in southern comfort. Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper. She came home screamin', a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her. [Proof]. Aiyo. Pursue to list 'em, there's no need to diss 'em. They be behavin', make sure your whole breathing system. Twist them like big caps, who wants to hear that. Rap, murder rates, and I snap vertebrates. Collapse further states, my tribe reserves the grave. Your pack deserve a crate, in fact the word is fake. I'll cook you slow like egg sufficient nuts. I'm holding vandanna like seven great-molested sluts. Calling me a bitch nigga, you need to stop. Reality, one on one. How many times you got dropped. I'm cut throat when any track runs, I smack none's. It's the rough method that makes Muslims run and pack guns. I'm volcanic (volcanic), the sermon preacher (preacher). Burning MC's most wanted by Herman Kefa. You tried to get a squad, they was like ""Money oh no"". Leavin' you brain dead, hittin' trees with Sonny Bono. I kick without a dojo, D-12 slow flow. Shoot down your mother ship and pimp slap mojo. No pro wanna go knuckle blades with renegade. Nigga tried to go pop, and plus they minute made. My lieutenant spray your brigade, and trampled your flow. Big P, the reason MC's canceled they shows. The truth will hurt, see Proof will work your shame in it. The best part of your show is when you put my name in it. My squad, godly, fearin' shit hardly. So I hope when I die, I dope like Chris Farley. Fuck that. [Bugz]. Who run shit, watch these drums hit. You dove head first into some old dumb shit. Here's a can of ass whip, for you to come get. Your clique made their trip, I made them hoes submit. Ask your girl, she knows the scoop don't fuck with Bugz bitch. I'll chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit. Them pink belly niggas is who you run wit'. Making half ass songs, shitty snares and one kick. I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit. You can make a double album, won't have one hit. Your entire outfit is on some bullshit. And there's not a damn one that I can't out wit'. I admit, that my style is unfit. For mamma's baby boy because I'm on some dumb shit. Like I commit arsony, get harm quick. You pull the alarm switch, I'll stab you in your armpit. Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit'. This egotistic, hip-hop fundal mentalisitic. Don't risk it, you'll get your shit split. Now keep your distance, and keep existence. I'm the persistent when it comes to bench shit. I smoked a blunt with my judge before my sentence. I'm relentless to deny you're senseless. Yo bitch, pay my bill that's where the hell your rent went. Fuck that. [Almighty Dreadknaughtz]. I killed competition, with no way out as an opposition. Execute the passengers on the flight my executive decision. Then reminisce on how shady the business. Terrorists asked by Israelis when they visit. Bombed in insentient. One word in three in the making, murdered the exhibition team finish. Beat the ref senseless. No timeout extended play papers over your intermission. And increasing the battlefield with the blood of Christians. Cryin' for the messiah, but he don't listen. I pop my wing when I top the stove frame boil sizzling. I fight a maniac cook, I do damage to kitchens. Fuck Home Depot, I demolition. When I home improve, I'll be there to fix it. For my school is supervision, for down finical aid smoked up my intuition. Only hang out with rappers with explicit lyrics. And pistol grip punks with a beef, bitch do you wanna get eaten. I got a mind full of troubles. Everything is in doubles. I buy my guns in couples. No time to replace fumbles. 'Cause MC's come and MC's go, we both flow. Injured from head to toe. No fit a model, we full throttle. You stuck in low, incapable to master flow. Everything is tactical, living mathematical. Watch master flow, unleash and let go. I shit like lava, original designer, married to marijuana since a minor. Making it a chance to see my battleship could get you wet like fibs, what. Applying death-defying feets, maintain to keep my peace. Flow like to see, when I release these beats over concrete. My president transitions has taken place. As eyes spread folk ally on the M-I-CR-O. Power he's cyphin' not quality, I deal it. Lays the track and made it real, I know my people feel it. Keep their head bobbin', and the emotional sobbin'. Plus a cultural cipher after shows, hoes slobbin'. Knobs, love the fuckin' flavor of the icing. Plus I'm precision, my double edge will continue slicin'"
desperation (feat. jamie n commons),"[Verse 1]. Girl you gimme writers block. I'm at a loss for words. My mind's as lost as yours. I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge. Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?. That's what I call a Roethlisberger. You drive me bonkers I'm about to get my swerve on for sure. Thought I was pimping 'til I felt like Nas, the first date. Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers. And I bought us a box of chocolates. no lozenges, cough drops or syrups. Probably should of never let me call that job of yours. To talk to your boss and ask him. if you can take off from work. Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert. Man we jumped in too fast. cause since then I can't be apart from her. Cause nobodies body's awesomer. I lust it, and she loves me cause I'm popular, but.... [Hook]. You know this ain't love. Oh, no, you know this ain't love. You know this ain't love. No, this ain't love. (What is it then?) It's desperation. She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her. (It's desperation). I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her. And here I go again. [Verse 2]. Well obviously, oblivious to me. I swore I was just invisible to you. til I went to the lengths I did to meet you. Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning. Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew. that this could be such misery. Cause now you see nothin but me. and I don't see nothin but you. And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in. We stuck to each others hips. and we can't do anything individually. Which is to cling on, scared to be alone. can't, specifically to describe it. I just can't seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you. Talkin bout ""I live and breathe you"". And you pretend to be as mentally. and physically addicted to me. As much as Chris Kalil is to reefer. Don't wanna be without you. don't wanna be with you neither, bitch. Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek. cause this ain't. [Hook]. You know this ain't love. Oh, no, you know this ain't love. You know this ain't love. No, this ain't love. (What is it then?) It's desperation. She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her. (It's desperation). I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her. And here I go again. [Verse 3]. Just want you to myself. don't wanna share you with no one else. What the fuck you whispering for?. You get on my nerves, you make me sick. I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fridge. I mean, it's time that we just split and leave the games behind. Your frame of mind ain't the same as mine. I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too. Get the picture? That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up. To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's. You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? Galisa. I'm just mad it took the time it took me to discover. You been using me for loot like I used you for looks. Thought you was too good for me, huh, yeah. Twat used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack. But I can't stomach this, I'm leaving you, I'm not coming back. She said ""The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?"". She grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head. I barely ducked and that's right. When she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe. Girl probably coulda put a 100 yard field goal, through the uprights. [Hook]. You know this ain't love. Oh, no, you know this ain't love. You know this ain't love. No, this ain't love. (What is it then?) It's desperation. She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her. (It's desperation). I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her. And here I go again (It's desperation)"

Might as well ride by in an ambulance. My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants. So call it siblin' rivalry. Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery. A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like. Lettin' somebody just live inside your head rent free. Real talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns. Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business. But I don't sip tea. (That's Nickel) ride around his block. All he knows is pitfalls. That's why he's always climbin' out his drop. (I got a question) do you wanna ride or die?. Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka. [Big Sean]. Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety. 100 percent cut, no stitches required. Welcome to Detroit, where, if you get that promotion. Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'. I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'. Boy, I hit the beat, I just treat that shit like a diary. I'm offended if you hear my new shit. And you ain't rewindin' me. Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see. Never callin' collect, I call to collect. My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in the vet. Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch. Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net. Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me. I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me. I'm overrespected. My mama's gated community's overprotected. So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch. Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 50 times a day. Back when 10th grade was like 50 days away. Tryna get paid 50 ways a day. Used to put 50 on the layaway. Now my closet 50 shades of grey. 26 and I've done lived a lifetime a few times. From futons to Grey Poupons. In church tryna get a little savings, yeah, coupons. I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes. Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines. Or takin' down my number like ""you still ain't got a new line? "". Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years. I know it took longer than 9 months. But fuck it, it's all in due time. I turned a blunt to a roach. With dreams of bein' a Beatle though. One, two I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral. When you come up in a place. Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful. This is just part 1, wait 'til the sequel. [Dej Loaf]. Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static. I swear I love my city, I just want a little static. See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static. Detroit vs. Everybody. [Danny Brown]. Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat. Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D. On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty. Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole. 'Cause I'm a Lynwood nigga, them young niggas say. Put a sack on your head. You bleed a lake on a Grand River. And to think our hood harder, then I might break the door. Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly. In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'. They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring. So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman. Had K's in front ya school. But I ain't going to Kettering. Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from. Zan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son. And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time. It's us vs them, Detroit vs Everybody. [Eminem]. Lately it seems as if it's me against the world. Like it was before my life became a movie. And they usually use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with. But I flip that script like AB filler. Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal. It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate free. And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script. I ain't bein' conceited. But I made it to radio, eat a dick. I still never ABC the shit. Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller. Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla. I was daydreamin' one day that I would be the shit. And if I ever end up escapin' the streets. I swear that I would stay here. Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real. Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler. Break all of my friends out of here. And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer. Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage. You crazy for me to flip. What's makin' you think I need a switch?. 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson. When he's raging and heated. And on the way to go beat his kid. On the track I spank like he just did. (DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch. Sick of bein' treated like me and shit. Jesus, I can see why people stop callin' me to do features. And them cyphers on BET. 'Cause if I wasn't me. I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit. Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch. 180 degrees in here. Trying to wait for the cedar chips. MCs bit off more than they can chew. Like a face full of Swedish Fish. Or Lorena with two penises. Hateful and genius, this inconvenience. And for the record, you won't want. This kind of static in your life. When I'm makin' you cling to it. They consider tryna reinsulate yah. When it's maybe in for another crazy winter. It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away. But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde. Sick of bein' underdog. Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit. May even seem as if. I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way I'm sayin' shit. Is playin' with your relation, changin' it. It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer. Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter. With a potato peeler and mushed her face. Into the entertainment center. It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again. The Bermuda Triangle. And attempted to make a safety center. Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger. Did you make arrangements with the gangsters. When you came here?. And I came to kill 'em. [Dej Loaf]. Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static. I swear I love my city, I just want a little static. See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static. Detroit vs. Everybody. [Trick Trick]. What up, though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody!. Hey, 'em let me get that instrumental. Take it down to the hood. Let the little homies get this remix crackin'. Detroit!"
die alone (feat. kobe),"[Eminem]. I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone. This bed's empty without you. You said you're moving on. But I'm having some trouble getting there. But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere. Fuckin' Valentine's Day. Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere. Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror. Yeah, how do I look?. You fuckin' just let me here to die didn't you?. Why didn't you respond yet?. I've written you five or six different times and. I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you. I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through. This couldn't be true, we can't be over. So violets are blue, roses are red. Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?. [Kobe]. Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night. I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light. Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back"". Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone. [Eminem]. Guess I gotta deal with the fact that. You ain't never comin' back. Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you. So I'm findin' something the matter with them. Excuse to not see anyone. Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all. Followin' protocol. I get bowled like bowling balls. Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say. Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman. I'm sick of playin' these games. I can't handle this heartbreak. It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains. Like birthday cake candles. Hang up the phone and I shake. I think I may have made a mistake. Can't escape the madness. Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song. But I can't even change the station. The same one's playin' on eight channels. I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate. I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes. In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I. Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night. I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light. Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back"". Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone. Give me one more, bottle for the pain. Give me one more for the memories. Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak. It'll help alleviate. It'll soothe this ache. Of trying to fake. That she's really, she's really coming back. [Eminem]. And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how. Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love. I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it. And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent. And how I'll never hold you again. And there ain't shit I can do about it. Now my head is overcrowded. With these clouded memories. And I can't seem to get you out it. And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably. Knowing what you done did to me, huh?. Did it even occur to you that I loved you?. Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you. Was you and me, wants us to be together forever. It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream. We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much. When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I. Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night. I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light. Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back"". Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone"
die hard,"[Dr Dre - Verse 1]. My life is like a highlight reel. Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel. I might continue on with my career for 5 light years. Critics can fly kites here?. Welcome to my nightmare. Pressures on, blood pressure racing. I calculate my next step, pacin?. Don?t know if I?ll meet expectations. All I know is the World better get set. Dre?s in effect. Been in it since you had cassette decks taping. I?m sick?. [Eminem - Hook]. I sit into the wee hours all night. And we don't stop until the sunlight. We just keep going cause the die hard won?t go down without a fight. ?I went to the wee hours all night. And we don't stop until the sunlight. We just keep going cause the die hard won?t go down without a fight. [Dr Dre - Verse 2]. It?s on, blood pressure racing. I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations. They're soaring too high to meet, my reputations in jep?. Yep, face it, the fans they?ve been upset yet patient, I love ?em for that. [Hook]. I sit into the wee hours all night. And we don't stop until the sunlight. We just keep going cause the die hard won?t go down without a fight. ?I went to the wee hours all night. And we don't stop until the sunlight. We just keep going cause the die hard won?t go down without a fight. [Develdiii]"
difficult,"They ask me am I ok. They ask me if I'm happy. Are they asking me that because of the sh-t thats been thrown at me. Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinly care. Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there. And I continuosly stare at pictures of you. I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do. Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me. What the f-ck good does that do me now. But somehow I know you're near me in presence. Or I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them. Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little. And dawg you'll never believe this. But Sharonda actually talks to me now. Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces. Man how could you touch so many f-cking lives and just leave us. They say grievance has its way of affecting everyone different. If it's true, how the f-ck am I supposed to get over you. Difficult as it sounds. Doody, that's what we call each other. I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us. We was always brothers. Never thought about each others skin colours. Til one day we was walking up the block in the summer. It was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn. Tryna walk under the trees. Just to give me some comfort. I'm moaning I just wanna get home. When I look over and his shirt is off. I'm like you gon fry and like. ""No I won't, I'm black stupid. Black people they got melatonin in their skin, we don't burn"". Meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt like I'm on fire. And the entire time you're just laughing at me. And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard. And I still have to get you back for that sh-t. And by the way them playboy rings. My mother stole from you. Well Nate finally got em back sh-t. It must have been at least 16 years ago. Well I put em in your cask-owww. Moving past it, it still ain't registered yet. But you can bet your legacy they'll never forget. The motor city mo-town. Hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads. It don't stop there. Yeah, as difficult as this sounds. And this may sound a little strange but I'mma tell it. I found that jacket that you left at my wedding. And I picked it up to smell it. I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass. And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it. And as for all of me and D12 we feel like f-ck rap. It feels like our General just f-cking died in our lap. We shut off all our pages. All our cell numbers is changed. Our two-ways are in the trash. So some cats will have to find a new way. And I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today. But the truth is there all still here and you ain't. Purple gang, you gotta pressing on. Don't ever give up the dream, dog. I got love for you all. And Doody, it's true you bought people together. Who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you. You were the peacemaker, Doody. I know sometimes you were moody. But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding. But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping. If it had to happen, it had to happen. Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to. Throw them balls back on Dresden. From making cars to paintballing getting arrested. To sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting. They tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question. I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up. Didn't show up for court. So we got off on a technicality, left sweating. Me, you and what's his face. I forgot his f-cking name. Shame he even came to your funeral. He betrayed our team. And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the f-cking face. And that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name. I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air. For you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot. Of 54 just before we were supposed to get in cars. To come and see you once more. Difficult as this sounds"

Weave eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed. Now that you've embraced the green. Don't fuck with the triple beams. You's a muthafuckin actor slash Pac impersonatin' rapper. Slash Billie Holliday how it happen?. Artist for Repetuar saw him in action. Pac assassination Def Jam grabbed him. Told him reinact him, you go platinum. They seen it for sure, I know that Afina Shakur. Don't enjoy Jeffery Atkins reinactin' her boy. So I'm click-clackin' this toy. Mash and destroy, Shady. Aftermath and Detroit muthafuckas. [Chorus].

Shootin' at me, with the only shot you got. Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac. You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop. [Verse 2]. [Kuniva].

We don't take you serious nigga you shook you half of a half-way. crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga. And you can't replace the late greal one.

Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta ya. purse. [Proof]. Slim did it simple to get at the wankstas. He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas. What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on. But you ?? the ?? for sucking your ??. What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz?. Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us. It's real business you ain't caught the concept. You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press. Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source. Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch. Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us. But Detroit niggaz ?? and ain't scurred to bust. [Kon Artis]. Word to my nigga Bugs, punks like you get beat up. Stomped unconcious and smacked with the heater. This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so. much that he should be fixed with a vagina. Who's behind ya? Cadillic Pac or that transvestite who dress. like a Lil Kim fox, her chest like a little windbox. press tight on the trigger of this glock. Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat. You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep. You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac. You 'Mockaveli', get your own identity. [Chorus]. [Eminem overdubs chorus]. Yeah!.

Ssshhit I almost hit this motherfucker today. [Xzibit]. Psh, is that right?. [Eminem].

And don't insult me, I won't insult you. Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do. [Xzibit]. Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight. Bein underrated gave me time to create it. Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate. Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate. Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate. Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face. No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows. You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home. But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me (yeah). Packed up, moved out, started a new family. So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up. marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?. FUCK THAT, this the fuckin thanks I get. for tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch. Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down). cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child. It's like... [Eminem]. .. everyday I wake up, another drama. It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma. If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer. I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her. without these cameras in our faces like animals. for your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue. and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts. and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence. And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun. whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one. No bullet, you're so full of shit. this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it. And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood. I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude. over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit. Don't tell me bout the show business shit. I know what this is, bitch. [Eminem]. Cause you don't know me, I don't know you. So don't approach me, I won't approach you. And don't insult me, I won't insult you. Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do. Cause you don't know me, I don't know you. So don't approach me, I won't approach you. And don't insult me, I won't insult you. Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do. [Xzibit]. This ain't business, this is personal BITCH. You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed. I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit. Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th. Yo Em it's time to get serious with it (yeah). Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet. This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs. Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us. Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self. I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth. To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla. at the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones. Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel. Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin piano. Ridin slow through Cali like I'm ridin a camel. Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels. I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?. Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down. Spit lines to split spines just to get mine. Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine. Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope. Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin the soap. Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip. and turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit. [Eminem]. So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself. a front door with twelve locks. and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox. and everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?. Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots. and one in the chamber, gun in the waist. and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place. tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not. gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?. And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys. in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn. screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit. Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip. And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live. so my address ends up on the internet again. So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them. that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs. And reporters, blow it out of proportion. ""Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans. just for tryin to stand on his porch"". And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like ""Hey hi!. You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!"". Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle. and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you. It's not that I don't like you... .. it's just that I'm not behind the mic. I'm a person who's just like you."
don't front (feat. buckshot),"[verse 1: eminem]. Used to getting bent, now I represent to the fullest. Pencil is full of insulin bullets. I'm like a doberman pinscher, pitbull and a rott'. Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken. I begin to spitting like vintage pac, demented. Demonic sinister, ever since the the doc replenished me. The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit. So to not see him with me would be a shocking image. And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is. Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it. And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics. Know that if I get off to a rocky start. I'll always have a rocky finish. Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? nope. But I hope I offended you. When I told ya how dope I am at this. And put emphasis on the ""dope. ""so when names come up. In that conversation of who's the dopest. Better throw mine in it. And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow. You won't find anywhere, where it fires. And I unload my pen explodes. 'til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time. Let insults fly even sixty seconds that go by. So you know I meant it. In school I was so shy, timid. Two pairs of jean's I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member. Begging my mom for kmart macgregors. Cause they were new. St. vincent de paul, those pony's were used. And no size fitted. But kissed them old days, adios, I did it. They said I was a gimmick. Now I'm the one that those guys mimic. Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument. Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow. That's more authentic and don't front. [hook: buckshot]. Don't front, you know I got you open, kid. [verse 2: eminem]. Rest in piece to big proof, you was a beast. You lyrically mirrored me. Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me. I love you, doody - without you I feel so incomplete. I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet. I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne. Better watch the fucking tone that you speak. Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league. On my motherfucking own, it's just me. No opponents can compete. And I've never been known to retreat from beef. Beep beep, follow trends or wallow in defeat. I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say bon appetit. Cause I don't know what to eat. Fucking microphone or the beat. Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine. It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes. Your mind's blown cause I rhyme. Like I'm still trying to get signed. Up in the ebony showcase with denaun screaming. ''who the fuck passed you the mic? ''. Never asked you like my shit from the git. I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch. You had you a nice run, now take a hike. I ever meet my match I'mma strike that bitch first. Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers. The real rappers get their motherfucking skills cracking. Word to buckshot and dru-ha, why the fuck not?. You don't like it suck cock - almost forgot. Before I signed with the doc I almost signed with duck down. Cause rawkus didn't make no offers so motherfuck loud. They jerked me around so what's up now?. Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like. Rubbing it and holding some grudge now. But don't front. [hook]. [verse 3: eminem]. Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write. Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe. But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak. I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe. It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight. Cause I'm hyper for something, need someone or something. This ighting this fire under me. It's breathing new life, it's like I already died once. I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny. My days of being broke was so long ago. I lost my concept of money. But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me. Oh shit, I'm down on one knee. I'm having a stroke of genius. Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey. From boy to man, it's still make a whore moan l. Ike a thyroid gland. I'm in another category, man. Don't put me up with them pop stars. I never needed a pat on the back to get at-a-boy band. No offense - yes offense. Has been set that'll never get met. Little fingers pressed against moby's nose. Shouts to obie, the curtains closed on my show. (but never forget that I'm the one. You thought wouldn't make it). You can't take it, oh. Got a whole generation of rappers coming up. That are nutty with the flow. But convince me you've heard. An emcee since me who's this good. With the fucking mincing of words. Without mixing words. That'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve. Whose mentally disturbed. You might as well stick a knife in me and turn. It'll be like my skin being indian burned. Haa, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?. Never been served if memory serves. I'd battle that till my own recollection remembers these words.

don't push me,"feat. Eminem, Lloyd Banks (G-Unit). [50 Cent]. I need you to pray for me (and). I need you to care for me (and). I need you to want me to win. I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been. Flows, bones, crushin', it's nothin'. I come up with somethin'. Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'. It's something you want, 745 chrome spinnin'. Haters hate that I'm winnin'. Man I've been hot from the beginnin'. Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy. 'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fittin' to catch a felony. Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it poppin'. Once I squeeze the first shot (gun shot), you know I ain't stoppin'. Till my clip is empty, I'm simply. Not that nigga you should try your luck with, or fuck with. Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, gun smokin', still locin'. what nigga, lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling. [Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]. Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me. I aim straight for your head, so don't push me. Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me. I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy. [Lloyd Banks]. I cross my bigger nigga, and I didn't cry. To young to understand, the consequences of a man. Livin' a lie, I gotta get that money. I'll be damned if I'm bummy. Gotta watch my back around these niggas. 'Cause they frontin' 20 years, of watching my mama's tears. Got my heated, heavily weeded. Smoking that bomb, cause I need it. These niggas don't want me ballin', they want me buried. Thrown in the dirt, from shots flurry. Layin' your bugs under my shirt. I got plans to hop up in that Hummer. 'Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder. . When them angels, gonna call my number. Under my chest is a heart of a lion. I ain't lying, bounty killers got me flyin'. With my iron, high as a giant. I'm runnin' from nothin', my stomach is touchin'. What I'm clutchin', to give you more than a concussion, end of discussion. My blood is colder, so I'm bolder. And it's either soda, hood on my shoulder. Look in the mirror, I see a soldier. [Chorus 2X]. [Eminem]. These are my ideas. This is my sweat and tears. This is shit that I solved, with my balls, my ears. This is me, who's got to be. What you see on TV, what you hear on CD, what appears easy. Man these teenie boopers see me on these magazine covers. In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies. Frontin' like it's all fun and games, 'til they shot up bang. When you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playin'. Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'. I bullied my way in this game, man I'm done playin'. Man I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin'. I'm a start layin' into these motherfuckering cocksuckers. There's no way I'm back down, like a god damn coward. I can't, how would I look as man, bowing to his knees. Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me. And not lash back out at 'em, please. Oh, whao, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall. You want to see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall. I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart. So I see I have to start, showing you fuckin' old farts,. A whole other side, I wanted to not show you. So you know you're not dealing with some fuckin' marshmallow, little soft yellow. Punk pussy, who's heart's Jello, 'cause. [Chorus 2X]."
down (yelawolf),"These donuts are delicious. Son of a bitch!. We got a 10-94 on Hines Road, requesting backup. Repeat, 10-94 on Hines Road heading southbound. I'm in pursuit!. Pick up, pick up, daddy's in the pickup. Got so much bounce the kick drum give me the hiccups. You don't want it with me, sucker, just look up. Beer flyin' in this mothafucka like bird shit. Ran these Mickey Thompsons up on the curb, bitch. Crook as a picture on Sunday. My maniac Slumerican squad mount up around your Hyundai. Chevy's up, we got low lives and bow ties. Up shit's creek, I'll take you for a boat ride. Stick his head in the water, now let him flap his lips. Motormouth, make a wave, yeah, Roll Tide. You're playin' golf in lightning? So am I. Dressed in a tin man suit. Drinkin' a tin can too, that is 110 proof. Man if I only had a heart for you bitches. I'd get down on my knees and help you dig them ditches. But mama only raised Hell. So when you're done diggin' that ditch, bitch, bury yourself. Pass me that Colt 45. I'm partyin' 'til my fuckin' throat sore and dry. I'm goin' down. Aww man you gotta love it. I'm on my way. Hey mama, all around the town they're sayin'. ""He's goin' down, Lord have mercy"". I'm country rich, no budget. Got to get paid. Hey daddy, all around the town they're sayin'. ""He's goin' down, Lord have mercy"". You drivin' drunk, better lift your seat up. Cause cops pull us over just to fuckin' meet us. Cause Marshall's a Rap God, damn right. Well, then I guess that makes me Jesus. So turn this water to whiskey. Watch the dirty south go from dirty to filthy. High class only means stoned in school. Joints rolled up bigger than pony stool. Smoke, stains on the roof of the old Regal's brown. So what I got spokes on this bitch, and?. The lift kicks like climbin' into a spaceship. UFO's, unidentified flyin' Oldsmobiles. And mobile homes, amen. I can still smell the kerosene leakin'. I should've seen the signs, I was blowin' up. Either in a trailer home or a pickup. Hey, Bubba, your baby boy is in big trouble. I fuckin' ran through a briar patch and got cut up. Now I'm wide open in front of the whole town. I bled for the game, I guess it's obvious now. I'm goin' down now, he told me wear it with pride. You wanna take the hard road you gotta cherish the ride. Most mothafuckers won't jump to embarrass the fly. Can't build a legacy up, then let it perish and die"

drop the world,"(Lil Wayne). I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes. Hate in my heart, love in my mind. I seen nights full of pain, days of the same. You keep the sunshine, save me the rain. I search but never find, hurt but never cry. I work and forever try, but I’m cursed, so nevermind. And it’s worse, but better times seem further and beyond. The top gets higher the more that I climb. The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger. Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a *****. But soon for a ***** it be on, mu’fucka. ‘Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu’fucka. (Chorus). So I pick the world up and I’ma drop it on your fuckin’ head. Bitch, I’ma pick the world up and I’ma drop it on your fuckin’ head. And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker. Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker. I’m gone. Motherfucker, I’m gone. (Lil Wayne). I know what they don’t wanna tell you. Just hope you’re heaven-sent, and you’re hell-proof. I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off. And confidence is the stain they can’t wipe off. Huh, my word is my pride. But wisdom is bleak, and that’s a word from the wise. Served to survive, murdered and bribed. And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside. (Chorus). So I could pick the world up and I’ma drop it on your fuckin’ head. Bitch, I’ma pick the world up and I’ma drop it on your fuckin’ head. And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker. Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker. I’m gone. Motherfucker, I’m gone (I’m gone). (Eminem). It hurts, but I never show this pain you’ll never know. If only you could see just how lonely and how cold. And frostbit I’ve become, my back’s against the wall. When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream “Fuck ‘em all”. Man, it feels like these walls are closing in this roof is caving in,. up its time to razor thin your days are numbered like pagers and. My book of rhymes, got ‘em cookin’, boy, this crooked mind of mine. got ‘em all shook and scared to look in my eyes I stole that fuckin’ clock, I took the time and I. Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up. Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame, that ain’t what. I came to claim but the game ain’t gonna be the same on the day that I leave it. But I swear one way or another I’ma make these fuckin’ haters believe that. I swear to God, won’t spare the rod I’m a man of my word, so your fuckin’ heads better nod. Or I’ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody!. Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head’ll lie. Permanently, bitch, it’s beddy-bye, this world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die. My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal. I’m unstoppable, incredible, hope you’re trapped in my medicine ball. I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin’ head’ll spin, dawg. I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives I’ll fuckin’. (Chorus). Pick the world up and I’ma drop it on your fuckin’ head. Bitch, I’ma pick the world up and I’ma drop it on your fuckin’ head. And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker. Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker. I’m gone. Motherfucker, I’m gone (I’m gone)"
drug ballad,"girl: Yea...(laughter)...whoooo...shit. hmmm, whoaaa, hmm .... Guess what?. I ain't coming in yet, i'll come in in a minute. Aiyo, this is my love song. It goes like this..... Back when Mark Walhberg was marky mark. This is how we used to make the party start. We used to...mix in with bacardi dark. and when it... kicks in you can hardely talk. and by the... sixth gin you gon probly crawl. and you'll be... sick then and you'll probly barf. and my pre-...diction is that you gon probably fall. either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall. and every-... things spinnin your beginning to think women are swimmin in. pink linen again in the sink. then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished. you are now allowed to officially slap bitches. you have the right to remain violent and start wildin. start a fight with the same guy that was smart eye'n ya. get in the car and start it and start drivin. over the island and cause a 42 car pile up. Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this planet sir, no. sign of it. All i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and I'm so high that I might die if. i go by it.. Let me out of this place I'm outta place, I'm in in outter space, I've just. vanished without a trace.. I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow, I'll be back in an. hour or so.. Cuz every time I go to try to leave (whoa-o-o). someone keeps pullin on my sleeve (whoa-o-o). I dont wanna but I gotta stay (whoa-o-o). these drugs really gotta hold on me (whoa-o-o). Cuz everytime I try ta tell 'em no (no-o-o). they won't let me ever let 'em go (go-o-o). I'm a sucker all I gotta say (whoa-o-o). is drug's really gotta hold on me. In third grade all I used to do, was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix. cube. Seventeen years later I'm as rude as jude (reference to rude jude who makes frequent apperances on jenny jones). Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs. I got no game, and every face looks the same. they got no name, so i don't need game to play. I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want, whenever i want, wherever I. want, however I want. However I do show some respect to few. This ecstacy has got me standin next to you. Gettin sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you. We just met, but I think I'm in love with you. But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too,. Wake up in the morning like ""What the fuck we do?"". I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do, Cuz if I get caught cheatin. then I'm stuck with you. But in the long run these drugs are gonna catch up sooner or later. But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy, let the ex destroy your spinal chord,. so it's not a straight line no more. So we walk around lookin like some wind-up dolls, shit stickin out of our. backs like a dinosaur,. Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more, so bye for now, I'm gonna try. to find some more. Chorus. That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow when you swallow it all. wallow and drown in your sorrow. And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again. What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it. and whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and whats a little fight,. tomorrow you'll be boys again. It's your life, live it however you wanna. Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?. It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin. Cuz none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin. They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin, even though you wake up. feelin like shit every mornin.. But your young, you got a lot of drugs to do, girls to screw, parties to. crash, sucks to be you. If I could take it all back now I wouldn't, I woulda did more shit that. people said that I shouldnt. But I'm all grown up now, and upgraded and graduated to better drugs and. updated. But I still gotta a lot of growin up to do, I still gotta whole lot of. throwin up to spew. But when it's all said and done i'll be forty before i know it wit a 40 on. the porch tellin stories. with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap, babysitting for Hailey, while. Hailey's out gettin shmashed.. Chorus x 2. drugs really gotta hold on me. really got a hold on me. drugs really gotta hold on me. they really got a hold on me"

[Eminem]. I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling. I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume ‘em. the only f-cking thing that you consume is time. Im super human, my world is like a Rubiks cube. its too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming. my mentality's caveman stupid woman. my life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe. I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago. so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow. cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo. oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful. diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair folicle and cuticle. rhyming to the call, to the (?) all the way down to my sock and the hair on my toe. learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole. cause I aint took no sh-t since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow. I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire. and this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her. cause this time muthaf-ckers I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her. I aint even put my tip in that hoe yet. Ima go get TIP and try to rip it wider. [Chorus]. Oh, all around the World,. theres an echo. as he takes a bow.

Im never refering to the solution. I'm talking about more like the mustang. vroom. get respect from the get-go, hello. set to the echo, pyscho. pen got a mind of its own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise. I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song. as the echo follows the Maserati. as the petrol swallows,. Im a thousand bodies away from a skeleton. check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant. I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings. I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,. right now I'm living a dream. though we may be reckless. the ladies check us. they whisper Shady records. baby echo. [Chorus]. Oh, all around the World,. theres an echo. as he takes a bow. And they all know all the girls, the boys. they chase the noise. through the highs and through the lows. they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo. they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo"
elevator,"Hook. There once was a saying that I used to say. Back in the day when I met Dre. I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof. That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof. He said ""what If you went platinum"", I'd just laugh at him. That's not happening, that I can't fathom. Eighty something million like it's worldwide,. Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator. Verse 1. Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady. You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me. Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele. Woopsa that a fucking daisy. That's an honour who even she knows dada's fucking crazy. Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking Av. Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me. Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby. You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up. But it's all caught up to me now, palm is in the waters. Every line I ever said has got me in a corner. You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does. You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started. Now your brains all horny cause of all the shit you thought of. Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust. I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but. Hook. There once was a saying that I used to say. Back in the day when I met Dre. I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof. That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof. He said ""what If you went platinum"", I'd just laugh at him. That's not happening, that I can't fathom. Eighty and some million records worldwide later. I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator. Verse 2. Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it. They get so mad, when I call them both fake it's. All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it. Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it. You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing. Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination. I lashed at the doctor in my last operation. Shoved the weiner snitzel up his ass, hopped away some-. body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him. Homie, I'm the shizer, pass doctor dre some. I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son. No not-a now, not a chance, not today son. I can't believe I leave for one breif second. You pussy queef all over the rap game, naked. And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it. I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it. Hook. There once was a saying that I used to say.

He said ""what If you went platinum"", I'd just laugh at him. That's not happening, that I can't fathom. Eighty and some million records worldwide later. I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator. Verse 3. Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later. I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I. Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em. Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em. Yeah, for every time you ride down the street. Or hideout, drive by my house and beep. Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep. Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep. And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?. Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy. This is my house, all nine thousand feet. So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth. Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top. Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop. Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop. While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!. Hook. There once was a saying that I used to say. Back in the day when I met Dre.

This must be all that there is, this must be it. Fuckin-A even got a potato. Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper. Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off. I can just toss a flying saucer in it. This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator. Living in a house with a fucking elevator"

Well I'll show him who's really 'bad'. Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls. You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'. And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop till I get enough'. Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?. Well he'll always be that Michael to me. And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'. Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons. And I hope they all fucking die!. How do you like that?. And I like him, I like him a lot. I want to touch him but I can't. Excuse me, I'm taking a shit. Sorry. Anyways, call me back. I have this idea about how I want to end the show.

eminem freestyle,"Artist: Tony Touch f/ Eminem. . [Eminem]. If I'm elected for ten terms. I'm renewing the staff after the inagural. And hiring all girls as interns. If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth. While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you. I'll take you straight to the pavement. Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet. Like a razor that shaved it. Three drinks and I'm ready to flash. Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on my ass (Look!). It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all. I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall. And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawl. (Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll). The Bad and Evil movement is comin. Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach. I write a rhyme a day. So it's no wonder how come your whole album. Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say. Whether it's one verse or one letter. I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever. It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us. The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit Monie Love."
eminem part 1,"Met a retarted kid named Greg, with a wooden leg. Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg. Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty. Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44-D. Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead. Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead. No more said case closed end of discussion. We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion. Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas. Cross the bombest. We blowing up your house. Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas. I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus. Cause I ain't making no more threats. I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes. On Vietnam war vets. I am more or less sick in the head. Maybe more. Because I smoked crack today, yesterday,. and the day before Sabateur. Walk the block with a labrador. Strapped with more straps than El Salvador. Foul style galore. Verbal cow manure."

emulate (feat. obie trice),"[Verse 1- Obie Trice]. Obie the person who came up inverted. Cause of nervousness, that was soley the only verdict. It was worth it cause he changed, became so observant. Certain such of a purpose, if you knew him earlier. From the days its like a different version. So much hurtin' and pain, gave him game for certain. That's why its curtains and its murder if you get him worked up. I'm so assertive on these mothafuckas actin' tougher. Had enough of isolatin' myself in the room. Writin' poems and songs doin' the same at school. Now look what he became a fool. Cause he learned how to sustain his two. And noctain fame from you. Livin' hard but still Julliard, a God walks. And ain't spent a day in the pew. Reguardless of this, I draw visuals pictures when a ***** vents. So welcome to the art department. [Verse 2- Eminem]. I stimulate the brain, mimic emulate the sane. Cynics keep on thinkin' its a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't. Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, suck Uranus. Label me a genius, if you ever seen us you would say. He may seem as though he's plain normal. If you ever meet him, greet with a shake. See he ain't as mean as what they say. See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say. So he's vague, so they mistake for just being crazed. You part ways, your impression will have changed. You don't think he's strange, you'll turn around and tell him peace and thanks. And catch him flippin' you off with his pants off, hands around his scrotum. Tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs"
encore/curtains down,"[50 Cent]. Shady, Aftermath. G-G-G-G, G-Unit!. [Hook: Eminem & 50 Cent]. Cause we came here to set this party off right. Let's bounce tonight. And if they don't let us in through the front. We'll come through the side. Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without. At least saying goodbye. So all my people on the left, all my people on the right. Scream one last time. [Eminem]. Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time. Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now. Here we go, cliff hanger, it's another club banger. Got you hanging on the edge of your seat, get on down. [Dr. Dre]. Times up, game's over, you lose, I win. Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here. Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin. Look who's got you going crazy again. I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in. I go out and just come back full circle again. You a fad, that means your something that we already had. But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad. [Eminem]. You're off the map now, radar can't even find you. We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you. You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you. We walk around just playing the violin behind you. Enough with all the pissing and moaning. whining and bitching. Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention. Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond. Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbing. [Hook]. [Eminem]. When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk. (Get it crunk, crunk, crunk, crunk). And when 50 Cent says jump. you get on one foot and jump. (Jump, jump, jump, jump). [Dr. Dre]. The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it. I don't gotta promote it for you to know. that Doc is off the benches. (We keep the party rocking off the hinges. We ain't showing off, we just going off popular consensus). But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk. Doc is all washed up, knock it off. who the fuck is Doc impressing?. Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression. You must be on the cock of Doc. cause Doc left you all guessing. So Dj take the needle and just drop it on the record. (What?). We gon' have this mutherfucker hopping in a second. (Bump bump). That's why we always save the best cut last. To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass. [Eminem]. Cause we done swam with the sharks. wrestled with alligators. Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers. Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap. maybe raised to be racist. Who may have never got to see our faces. Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages. broke down barriers. Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders. And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic. and we can play the, back. And forth all day like the hot potato game. that's why we came to. [Hook]. [Eminem]. 50 Cent, come on!. [50 Cent]. Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do. We make the club jump everywhere we go. It's no secret, everybody know. When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved. [Dr. Dre]. And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sundays. And palm trees Cali, every day it's just another party. From the valleys, all the way to them 8 Mile alleys. (Let's rally, hands up for the grand finale. Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak. Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week). You could catch me in the studio banging out the beats to. Provide you with the heat. that keep blazing out your speaker. [Eminem]. So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together. Along with G-Unit Records presents. the return of the... the Doc (and Shady). No one could do it better, we tear the club up. And leave without a shred of evidence and uh. [Hook]. [Outro: Eminem]. Yeah, still Aftermath, 2006. And don't worry 'bout that Detox album. It's coming, we gon' make Dre do it. Haha!. 50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre. We ain't leaving, let's go!. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out, peace!. Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're coming with me. Bye bye! (See you in hell, fuckers)"

evil deeds,"Lord please forgive me for what I do. For I know not what I've done. CHORUS. Father please forgive me for I know not what I do. I just never had the chance to ever meet you. Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be. my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds. Momma had a baby and it's head popped off. (head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off). My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off. (gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off). Ring ring ring, on the doorbell and the next door neighbors on their front porch. (their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch). But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn. (else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn). Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles. (Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles). They were the ones who were left in charge. My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song. (sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song). It go a little something like. ""Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb. Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn. Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand. And by the way, where's my dad?"". Chorus. Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly. Predominantly white, predominantly black. But what about me, where does that leave me. Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em. I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream. While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?. Do you think that I'm kidding?. What do I look like some kind of idi.... Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that. Why am I so misunderstood?. Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit, it's just mo' bitch. Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again. Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in. From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad. And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it. Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it. I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard. needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it. Man if I only had half of it... (shit). If you only knew the half of it. Chorus. Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds. Please release me from these demons. I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe. I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry. Now look at all the pain I caused. Dear Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again. What did I do that was so bad to deserve this. Everything could have been so perfect. But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air. Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere. I don't even know what it feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel. And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel. Without this crowd everywhere I go. but life is like a merry-go-round. Here we go now, doe see doe, now curtains up, the show must go. Now ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now. But the curtain just don't close for me. This ain't how fame is supposed to be. Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be. So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on. Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, myself is gone. Father please forgive me for I know not what I do. I just never had the chance to ever meet you. Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be. my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds. I said father please forgive me for I know not what I do. I just never had the chance to ever meet you. Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be. my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds. Oh!. Last one baby. Let's go. DETROIT!"
evil twin,"[intro]. Yeah, trying to figure out the difference. But I think... I think the lines are starting to get blurry. [verse 1]. I'm in a strange place. I feel like mase when he gave up the game for his faith. I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints. Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space. Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face. I need a change of pace cause the pace. I'm working at is dangerous. There's nowhere to dump this anger. And thanks to this angst. I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey. And started slowly roasting 'em. Cause that's where most of my anger is based. Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the saints. I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks. Then aim for all these fake kanye's, jay's, wayne's. And the drake's. I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'sync. Now I'm all out of whack. I'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack. I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is. I'm strapped for battles. Suck a duck, crawl out the back, bar fight. Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools. Flying through the air. And bottles breaking, mirrors also. And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full. You done called every woman a slut. But you forgetting sarah, marshall. Oh my bad, slut. And next time I show up in court I'll be naked. And square a lawsuit. Judge be like '' that's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?. Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you. And jmp your bones, you sexy motherfucker. You so fucking gravy, marshall, I should start calling you ""au jus"". Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo. Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you''. I believe people can change, but only for the worse. I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse. So satanic K-Mark panic. Cause they can't even spin back the curse words. Cause it works when they're reversed, motherfucker. And these kids are like parrots. They run around the house just like terrorists. Screaming ''fuck, shit, fuck''. Adult with a child is like arrogance. Wild ever since the day I came out. I was like ''merits, fuck that''. I'd rather be loud and I like swearing. From the first album even the gals were like. ''tight [?] , screamy eyes''. But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish. And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this. And the opposition felt the opposite. Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums. Often as I can and skim through all them bitches. To make sure I keep up with my competition. [?] of beats, hoarder of rhymes. Borderline genius who's bored of his lines. And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now. Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies. . [Hook:]. There?s darkness closing in (evil twin). There it goes again (my evil twin),. It controls my pen (my evil twin),. But that ain?t me, it?s my evil twin. (then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin). But he?s just a friend (evil twin),. Who pops up now and again (again). So don?t blame me (evil twin). Blame him, it?s my evil twin. [interlude]. Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend. You have slept for quite some time. [Verse 2:]. So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber. Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither. Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever. Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3?s. Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'. Bed-ridden and destined never to leave the. Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger. My suicide notes, barely legible read the. Bottom, it's signed by The Joker. Lorraine said I never can leave her. She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her. Fuck that shit, bitch. Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers. I'd ever left it to Beaver. Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver. Golly-wally I bet he registered Jesus. Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definitely my destiny. When on the steps I met Deshaun at Osborn. I'd never make it to sophomore. I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors. Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em. 'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em. They were sleeping, I made them stop snorin'. Made them break out the popcorn. Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form. Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn. Screaming ""fuck the police"" like cop porn. Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin. Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4. And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore. And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?. And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him. And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants to plain Eminem?. But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin). Please come in, what was your name again?. Hi, faggot. Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there. Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair. And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs. Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there. Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me. That I should call the loony police to come get me. 'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish someone?d finally admit me. To a mental hospital with Britney. Oh, Lmfao, no way, ho. Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, Oj no. Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony. Hey ho, hey ho. I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to hip hop hooray. No, I'm hollering, you got bottom in like an 8-0-8. And a base whether we're fucking of that instead of your face, so. Let your low-end raise, yo. Tango, what you think, ho?. Slow dancing in the bowling. You trying to hold hands with your homie?. What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?. Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me. Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner. Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt. Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work. So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work. But all bullshit aside I hit a stride. Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed. As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side. And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize. 'Cause we are the same, bitch"
fack,"CHORUS. Arghhh, arghhh argh arghhhh (Oh God damn). I'm gonna fuckin' cum (Oh shit). Fack, fack, fack (Fuck I am). I am, I'm going to cum (I'm cummingggggg). I never seen no shit like this.

Oh fuck I think it's stuck, oh but it feels so fuckin' good!. Chorus. Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube (4x). Ewww ewww ewww ewwww"
fall,"You know, everybody's been tellin' me. what they think about me for the last few months. It's too loud. Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them. Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs. from the parking lot. It's too loud. Freeze my crown all up in it. Slow fire. Don't fall on my face. Don't fall on my faith, oh. Don't fall on my fate. Don't fall on my faith, oh. Don't fall on my fate. Don't fall on my. Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race. Got no time to waste, I'm already late. I got a marathoner's pace. Went from addict to a workaholic. Word to Dr. Dre, In that first marijuana tape. guess I got a chronic case (yeah). And I ain't just blowin' smoke. 'less it's in your momma's face. I know this time Paul and Dre. They won't tell me what not to say (nope). And though me and my party days. Have all pretty much parted ways. You'd swear to God I forgot. I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid"". One last time for Charlamagne. If my response is late, it's just how long it takes. To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away. These rappers are like Hunger Games. One minute, they're mockin' Jay. Next minute, they get their style from Migos. or they copy Drake. Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away. But all the hate, I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate. I've had as much as I can tolerate. I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience. I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once. You wanted Shady? You got him!. Don't fall on my face (yeah). Don't fall on my faith, oh. Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!). Don't fall on my faith, oh (rr!). Don't fall on my fate (look). Somebody tell Budden before I snap. he better fasten it. Or have his body bag get zipped. The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches. And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks. Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted. Like you had it when u thought you had me slippin' at the telly. Even when I'm gettin' brain. you'll never catch me with a thot. Lackin' with it, ""he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"". Ho, you better go back and listen. You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up. Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup. Hopin' that you rappers fall in that. Dre said, ""Hold your head up! "". Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition. slap the clip and cock it back on competition. This is how I shot ahead (pew). Gabby Giffords, my attack is vicious. Jack the Ripper, back in business. Tyler create nothin'. I see why you called yourself a f****t, bitch. It's not just 'cause you lack attention. It's because you worship D12's balls. you're sack-riligious. If you're gonna critique me, you better. at least be as good or better. Get Earl the Hooded Sweater. Whatever his name is to help you put together some words. more than just two letters. The fans waited for this moment. like that feature when I stole the show. sorry if I took forever (haha). Don't fall on my face (yeah). Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't). Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!). Don't fall on my faith, oh (ha). Don't fall on my fate (it's too easy). Just remember-I was here before you. And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you. Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew. Just what the doctor ordered. Revenge is the best medicine. Increase the dose, from least to most. Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves. they suck the blood from all the biggest artists. like some leeches. So they nominate 'em, get 'em there. get a name to MC the show. Every parasite needs a host. Then give Album of the Year. to somebody that no one's ever even heard of. All I know is I wrote every single word. of everything I ever murdered. Time to separate the sheep from goats. And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts. When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer. A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air. Somewhere, some kid is bumping this. while he lip-syncs in the mirror. That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care. But you would think. I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket. How I'm buryin' these artists. On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'. Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'. And what's scary is you probably. Can compare me to your car. 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started. And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone. Or I'll show you an Elvis clone. Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone. You should telephone and go fetch me the remote. Put my feet up and just make myself at home. I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture. I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the. Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh. Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan. But I'm not gonna fall… bitch!. It's too loud. Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs. from the parking lot. It's too loud. Threes not a crowd all up in it. Slow fire"

fast lane,"[Royce Da 5'9"":]. First verse, uh. I'm on 'til I'm on a island. My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot. Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with' kindness. I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse. You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form. Slap up a cop and then snatch 'I'm out of his uniform. Leave him with' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on. And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn. Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know. Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'. Bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole. Me and Shady deaded the past. So that basically resurrected my cashflow. I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke. Though I ain't wrapped tight. My blood type's the '80s!. My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys. You still fly kites daily!. [Eminem:]. Catch me in my Mercedes. Bumpin' ""Ice, Ice Baby, "" screamin' Shady 'til I die. Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy. So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze. And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady. Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Damn). Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is. 'cause she's kinda famous. And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this. Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!. You morons think that I'm a genius. Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin',. Try them trailer parks. Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby. And that's back with' a capital B with' an exclamation mark, maybe. You should listen when I flip the linguistics. 'Cause I'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit. You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit. 'Cause after I spit the bullets. I'm a treat these shell casings like a soccer ball. I'm a kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'm a live this. [Chorus:]. Livin' life in the fast lane. Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down. Only got a gallon in the gas tank. But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now. I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride. Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die. I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). [Royce Da 5'9"":]. My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit. At war with' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs. My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins. I made a pact with the Devil that says ""I'll let you take me. You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse, Jack Kevorkian"". Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in. I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down. My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers. Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity. [Eminem:]. Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper. Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out. Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down. He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now. Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town. Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck them all, he's just. A whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time a-r-r-round. And he came to the club tonight with' 5'9? to hold this bitch down. Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown. Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated. Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips,. I'm agitated, aggravated. To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated. Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it. [Royce Da 5'9"":]. And then after takin' that, I'm a catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'. It's gon' say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affadavit. Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator. To Michael Jackson' activator (Woo!). Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data. Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer. Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater. Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper. Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent). [Eminem:]. Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes. What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator. Brung ya lay to this party, be my penis ejaculator later. Tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt. You rollin' with' a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'. [Chorus:]. Livin' life in the fast lane. Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down. Only got a gallon in the gas tank. But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now. I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride. Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die. I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). Life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal). Pedal to the metal. Pedal to the metal, metal, metal. Crédito: LE0Sousa"

Keep on going you just gotta fight it,. keep on going cause it's never too late,. you can't back down, you can't back down.. [Eminem]:. If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it. Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it. Then spit it back in the faces of you racists. and hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit. You Liberace's, Versace's, and you nazis. Watch me, cause you thinking you got me in this hot seat. You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me cause you're NOT me. You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me. I came to save these new generations of babies. from parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy. To grow to praise me I'm makin 'em go crazy. That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me. And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong. I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on. And this song is for any kid who gets picked on. A sick song to retaliate to, and it's FIGHT MUSIC!. [Chorus]:. Keep on going you just gotta fight it,. keep on going cause it's not too late,. you can't back down, you can't back down.. Keep on going you just gotta fight it,. keep on going cause it's never too late,. you can't back down, you can't back down.. [T.I]:. They say out of sight is out of mind. And 9 times out of 10 me and out of pocket out of line. You do it big everybody that you out shined. Then your old lady fate talk about how he got fine. She say she trying to get away. He say about time. Right now we all thinking damn hope it not mine. But when its lights out for you and you locked down. ain't not telling whether or not your lady when and got down. With that nigga cross town cause he hot now. Ripping up your love letters, lifting up her night gown. Right now somebody baby moma gettin piped down. kids in the next room listening, ima pipe down. The thought hurt don't it. But maybe she strong enough. for ain't get that lonely cause you wasn't gone long enough. True. It's just a temporarily setback. It's on when I get back , Like yeaah. [Chorus]:. Keep on going you just gotta fight it,. keep on going cause it's not too late,. you can't back down, you can't back down.. Keep on going you just gotta fight it,. keep on going cause it's never too late,. you can't back down, you can't back down."

fine line,"[Verse 1]. Another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though. Oh well, this is my life so. As I go and try to close for the nights show. See how far that line goes. Still blows my mind show. Business I'll never get some of this shit just always gives a weird. To this day cause all I ever did. Was just say the shit I'm the one that wanted to hear. Other people say to me when I was a kid. Son please don't make me some type of hero. Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way. But will still have a field day with some of the. Fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck the dick. Cause I still make fun of a situation. Someone's in like a son of a bitch. At anothers expense, I'm fuckin' relentless. As fuck when it comes to this pen. I struggle with coming to my senses. Stuck on the fence on a balance beam if I seem unbalanced. It's challenging but my conscience allows me to think. The most foulish childish things without even blinking. Without even thinkin' about, all the stinkin' amounts of people that seem to be reachin' in the crowds. I'm scream in the palace, sold out this evening. But now it's, maybe down to sleeping. Is it really my soul to keep or. Have I sold it cheap is it greed. Do I take more than I need. When I joke about leavin'. But keep over achievin'. Because whats stolen from me barely broke even. [Hook]. It's a fine, fine line. It's a fine, fine line. [Verse 2]. So I notice how I paint myself. And through my hair when ordeals I'm so vain. I want my respect but ignore the. Butterfly effect that comes from my dialect. Till I, sit in the dark and I reflect. And my reflection shows what it's like here. Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights yeah. It's like a nightmare. I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare. And I don't like how I see myself so I. Open the Bible to Isaiah cause. I swear to Christ there are nights where. I stay up at night just to say a prayer twice. Just to make sure God hears cause this ice layer. Ice skate on tonights where. Put in it but I like stands. Feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player. I got a nice pair of dice here. Sealed off in my lair. Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit. From this house it's quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it. And I feel so isolated, nice I made it. But it's like I payed the price of fame twice I hate it. So I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it. Then I wonder why I'm still famous. Keep walkin' the line. This gold fish poke it's old. But especially when you don't know. If your conscience is sayin' I told you so. You don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier. Or if you sold your soul. [Hook]. [Bridge]. And from here you look so small. Hovering high above us all. Please come back, to me. [Verse 3]. I still remember the times when. They were simpler than the rhymes of. Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics. I'll never forget what that feeling was like. God, I miss those times now when I was just starting out. Without a diamond, now I'm diamond. I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been. Stuck in this house hibernate. Hate even going outside it. Sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'. I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it. Look how excited, I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and. Everything about it I miss. Which now reminds me. Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz. Wow, I must have had Alzheimers. Long time since I shouted them out, bout time. Cause it's been on my mind lately how. Zee you always supported me. You vouched, I will never forget that and. How you guys, accepted me for me and Pace. I love you too, you slept on my couch. And I been thinkin' bout the time I slept on the floor at the outhouse. Rhyming is all we ever wanted to do. And regardless how life has turned out. Inside I'll always be an outsider. My life has been turned inside out but I"
fly away (featuring just blaze),"[Just Blaze - Chorus]. Some people ask me, where I've been lately. They thought I fell off, nobody could save me. I play in the background, I don't back down. So don't get it twisted, tryna play me. First I come out, they underate me. Then I come back, still try to fade me. They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy. Ask what I think, I say maybe. I fly away. It ain't nothin' in my way so I may aswell fly away. It ain't nothin' else to say so I may aswell fly away. I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon die today. Cos I've been to the top and there's nowhere else to go. The only way to see me is if you lookin' up from down below. And there's nothin' else to say so I may aswell fly away. And there's nothin' in my way so I may aswell fly away. I'm on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away. [Eminem - Verse 1]. Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up. I'ma step up on the stage now, I'm gonna strut. And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt. And you ain't gotta tell me notin' boy, get off of my nuts. It goes one for the money, two for the show. My shit don't stink, I don't think so. Wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll. Are you ready now, here we go. The bald eagle has landed. I'm back in ya hair, sorry for leavin' you stranded. I'm twice as dread and evil and rancid. They cant sit, I don't think anybody understands it. Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands, its play dough. I ain't got to play though, they say I died in a fatal. Car crash, shows what they know. Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car. The white trash star. I f-ckin RV up like Brett Favre. Homie you got it backwards, your dippin your soup inside ya crackers. I can carry rap til my back hurts. Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors. Get my back right. Now I'm right back on you bastards. I was chasin' the dragon, I don't know what happened. It was like the feelin' I had when I first started rappin'. I just could'nt seem to get back and recapture that magic. So I went back to the lab, thats where I've been at when.... . [Just Blaze - Chorus]. Some people ask me, where I've been lately. They thought I fell off, nobody could save me. I play in the background, I don't back down. So don't get it twisted, tryna play me. First I come out, they underate me. Then I come back, still try to fade me. They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy. Ask what I think, I say maybe. I fly away. It ain't nothin' in my way so I may aswell fly away. It ain't nothin' else to say so I may aswell fly away. [Eminem - Verse 2]. I took a hiatus haters now I'm back to cause trouble. Got the f-cking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles. I'm the *bang* you ain't f-ckin sick. The hospital won't even give you cough drops for course cocksucker. You think your hot, you ain't even luke warm. My pubes hotter than you. Your soft I use fire to cool me off. I told em I'll grow up one day and show 'em I'd be able to choke clouds. Pick up lightenin' bolts and throw 'em. Take the world by storm with these words I form. Georgie porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for em. Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn. Sworn over my sweat towels, its mind blowin. Yes I'm livin' the dream homie, cant nothin' compare. I'm so up, I'm stuck in mid air I'm lovin' it yeah. Its like these people are steps now, all they do is stare. These haters is so p-ssy they're afraid to be scared. This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay. They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact way. And leave this rap game with a bad taste,. And slap it back out, before I step back out of this crap thanks. Slap me now I'm slapping 'em back hey! f-ck it we'll slap back. But yeh okay now we'll talk cause I'm smack ay. And I ain't looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack. How's that for hindsight, what the track say?. [Just Blaze - Chorus]"

(Eminem)- ""Sh....Sh....Shady!"". (Eminem)- ""that...that.....that's me"". (Mr. Eon)- ""Iron Mic Trilogy"". (Erik Sermon)- ""back with the...funky...beats"". Mr. Eon:. Packing the third eye rush you it's cyclopse. They trade in their high tops for night sized Withe rocks. Words in my right, they pass my left ear. It's solid decked out write the books for next year. Bear this grenade you got stuck like virgin. Who that cat splurgin' instead or rehearsin?. Tough guy, dj travi your high rise. Looking more like ronald then the fuckin fry guys. Go on uptown fucking senoritas. In Taco Bell screaming ""vivas gorditas!"". Bring all your dogs i give em rabies. They never had a chance i might chew up all their babies. (Eminem: waaah!). Pope John Paul the second, brain like satan. Have your beaten girlfriend cooking up bacon. I'm obituite with that shit that you hit. Slow my flick with ya cause mine to pick wit her. Eminem:. My nine is limpin ya six deep when i spray rounds. Hit you with 12 shots in mid air and four more on the way down. The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground. You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!). No pun intended, snapped out of your whip. And leave it un-attended before i whip out this gun and hit it. Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute. Cause i can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it. Snap the airbag, hit the corner and park it. You wanted a market, i got her tied up in a chair and gag. Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged. Like cave-women, while i'm grave diggin' with Marilyn Man. Mr. Eon:. If you got a bowl of hash better cash it. Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit. Eminem:. And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone. I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast i'm gonna detach it. Mr. Eon:. If you got a bowl of hash better cash it. Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit. Eminem:. I'm flabergasted off two tabs of acid. Threw my baby's mother in a nap sack and latched it. Mr. Eon:. Yo, ""Eon's whack now"", how you dig that?. Couldn't get on my record if you were street rap. Get the greater rate with these rhymes i be totin'. Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem. I got stupid mucus from these loose lips. My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak. To the point when you stand up on your feet {you} best retreat. Let's go back in time and steal my whole seed. The quickening, did a ?briss? at the crispening. I'm exercisin', to uplifting the foot stage. This thing's the nicest, i keep telling you. What the fuck this guy on the corner been selling you?. (Eminem: ""here buy this""). Eminem:. I'm e-mailing you, at the wrong website. Mispelling you, break you and put the fear of hell in you. Escape above you, stuff the nurse in a purse. Disperse like i added too many words in a verse. Slim Shady, a perverted virgin at birth {or ""version of birth""}. Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church. The first person searching the earth for the motherfucker. That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first. You don't curse and hit with your own words. Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves. And if i don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up. Then i'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up (fuck y'all!). Mr. Eon:. If y'all got a bowl of hash better cash it. Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit (Eminem: ""gimmie that""). Eminem:. And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone. I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast i'm gonna detach it. Mr. Eon:. So if you got a bowl of has better cash it. Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit. Eminem:. I'm flabergasted off two tabs of acid. Threw my baby's mother in a hatch-back and latched it. Eminem:. Any disease out there i'm willing to catch it..... Slim Shady.....All praises. To the High & Mighty. (scratches):.

You can call it statutory. When a nigga blow up. They can build statures of me. Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin. Now superbad chicks giving me macLovin. You would think I ran the world. Like Michelle's husband. You would think these niggas would know me. When they really doesn't. Like they was down with the old me. No you fucking wasn't. You're such a fucking loser. He didn't even go to class bueller. Trade the Grammy plaques just to have. My granny back. Remember she had that bad hip. Like a fanny pack. Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac.

But what should I scream for this is my theme park. My minds shine even. When my thoughts seem dark. Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk. Let the king talk check the price and pay attention. Little Wayne that's what they got to say or mention. I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer. I'm resting in the lead I need. A pillow and a cover. Schhhhhhh, my foot is sleeping on the gas. No brake pads no such thing as last. (Drake). It may not mean nothing to y'all. But understand nothing was done for me.

He can make them look like bozos. He's wonderin if he should spit this slow. Fuck no, go for broke, his cup. Just runneth over oh no. He aint had a buzz like this. Since the last time he overdosed. They have been waiting patiently. For pinnochio to poke his nose. Back into the game and they know. Rap will never be the same as before. Bashin' into the brains of these hoes. And Establishin' a name as he goes. The passion and the flame is ignited. You can't put it out once we light it. This shit is exactly what the fuck. That I'm talking bout when we riot. You dealin' with a few true villians whose staying. inside of the booth truth spillin'. And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings. Come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it. Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me. How's it taste? When I slap the taste. Out of your mouth with the bass so loud. That it shakes the place. I'm hannibal lecter so just in case. You was thinkin of savin face. You aint gonna have no face to save by the time. I'm through with this place so drake. (Drake). It may not mean nothing to y'all.

forgot about dre,"[Dr. Dre]. Y'all know me, still the same O.G., but I been low key. Hated on by most these niggaz wit no cheese, no deals and no G's. No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles, and no ski's. Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries. Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall full of plaques. Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies. Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Hoe please. You better bow down on both knees. Who you think taught you to smoke trees?. Who you think brought you the oldies?. Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C's. The Snoop D-O-double-G's. and the group that said mother-""Fuck Tha Police"". Gave you a tape full of dope beats. to bump when you stroll through in your hood. And when your album sales wasn't doin too good. who's the Doctor they told you to go see?. Y'all better listen up closely. All you niggaz that said that I turned pop, or The Firm flopped. Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep. so FUCK Y'ALL, all of y'all; if y'all don't like me, BLOW ME!. Y'all are gonna keep fuckin around wit me. and turn me back to the old me. Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X). Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say. but nothin comes out when they move their lips;. just a bunch of gibberish. And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre. [Eminem]So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?). Or anyone tryin to bring trouble your way?. Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (YUP). Then just study a tape of N.W.A.!. One day I was walkin by, wit a Walkman on, when I caught a guy. give me an awkward eye (What you lookin at?). And strangled him off in the parkin lot, wit his Karl Kani. I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not. I'm harder than me tryin to park a Dodge. when I'm drunk as fuck. Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage {*CRUNCH*}. Hoppin out wit two broken legs, tryin to walk it off. ""Fuck you too bitch, call the cops!"". I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs. And when the cops came through me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house. Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches. And still weren't found out (RIGHT HERE). From here on out it's the Chronic 2. Startin today and tomorrow's the new. And I'm still loco enough. To choke you to death wit a Charleston Chew. {*Eminem's vocal turntable*}. Slim shady - hotter then a set of twin babies. in a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up. when the temp goes up to the mid 80's. Callin men ladies; sorry Doc but I been crazy. There's no way that you can save me. It's okay, go with him Hailey (Da-da?). Chorus. [Dr. Dre]. If it was up to me, you muh'fuckers would stop comin up to me. wit your hands out lookin up to me, like you want somethin free. When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin me. But now that I got this little company. Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease. But you won't get a crumb from me. Cause I'm from the streets of (Compton, Compton). I told em all - all them little gangstas. Who you think helped mold 'em all?. Now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like I ain't got none. What you think I sold 'em all?. Cause I stay well off. Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off. What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad. tryin to get this damn label off?. I ain't havin that; this is the millennium of Aftermath. It ain't gon' be nothin after that. So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap!. You can have it back. So where's all the Madd Rappers at?. It's like a jungle in this habitat. But all you savage cats, know that I was strapped wit gats. when you were cuddlin a Cabbage Patch"
framed,"Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's. ""Freaky Tales"" (Biatch!). Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking. And envisioning sneaking into. where Christie Brinkley dwells. I know this is risky thinking. but I wanna stick her like she's decals. But when murdering females. Better pay attention to these details. or you could be derailed. Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail. If you get scratched because. your Dna'll be all up under her fingernails. Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares. He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears. Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware. Her Tv blares. can't hear the creaking stairs. She's unaware in no underwear. she's completely bare. Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly. I said: ""I'm here to do sink repairs. "". Chop her up, put her body parts. in front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there. But hey man, I was framed. I know what this looks like, officers. Please just give me one minute. I think I can explain. I ain't murdered nobody. I know these words are so nutty. But I'm just here to entertain. How come your shirt is so bloody?. There's a missing person, so what?. He's got nothin' to do with me. I'm almost certain I was framed. Woke up, it was dawn. Musta knew somethin' was wrong. Think I'm becomin' a monster. 'cause of the drugs that I'm on. Donald Duck's on. there's a Tonka Truck in the yard. But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump. in the trunk of my car?. Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it. Must go above and beyond. 'cause it's incumbent upon me. Plus I feel somewhat responsible. for the dumb little blonde girl. That motherfuckin' baton twirler. that got dumped in the pond. Second murder with no recollection of it. Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it. Memory's too fucked to remember. Destructive temper. Cut my public defender's jugular. then stuck him up in a blender. Another dismembered toddler. Discovered this winter, probably. 'Cause the disassembled body. Was covered up in the snow. since the month of November, oddly. I'm wanted for questioning. Them son of a bitches. probably just wanna pin this on me. But hey man, I was framed. I know what this looks like, officers. Please just give me one minute. I think I can explain. I ain't murdered nobody. I know these words are so nutty. But I'm just here to entertain. How come your shirt is so bloody?. There's a missing person, so what?. He's got nothin' to do with me. I'm almost certain I was framed. Still on the loose, they. Spotted me inside Mcdonald's, Tuesday. In a Toronto Blue Jays cap. lookin' like your college roommate. With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher. Or was it Cool J?. The cops is on a goose chase. Just escaped from the state pen. For r'aping eight women who hate men. Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked. When I break in your basement. Under your baby's playpen. I lay in, wait adjacent. Facin' the door, remainin' patient. while stayin' complacent. Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown. Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems. Left on your pillow in hopes. That when you get home. You'll get the hint, ho. ""I'm in your window"". But it never occurred to me. I could describe a murder scene. In a verse and be charged with first degree. 'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly. With the massacre or the Burger King burglary. No, officer, you see. I was framed. I know what this looks like, officers. Please just give me one minute. I think I can explain. I ain't murdered nobody. I know these words are so nutty. But I'm just here to entertain. How come your shirt is so bloody?. There's a missing person, so what?. He's got nothin' to do with me. I'm almost certain I was framed"

It was another friendship broke in half. and watch you turn everything into a game and joke and. laugh. and both of us know we can't discuss the situation. Like adults each confrontation just results in. accusations and insults. so I'm just let it go from that. we need to be I told you now, from that. what goes around comes back around. believe me, duck from that, come here you fuckin.... [Chorus : Proof]. Come here you fuckin backstabber. why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha. come here you fuckin backstabber. why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha. [sample]. ""Fuck it, Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit. to last me clear to the ends""[2x]. [Eminem]. Take a second to stop and think about what you done. and you woulda thought that being a friend, Instead of. what you won. All because of what you run your mouth. you wanna prance around and gloat?. let's see how well you dance around. when i got my hands around your throat. Cause It's a matter of time till I get my blows in and. it won't be long. You shouldn't go walkin around and stickin your nose. in where it don't belong. Cause everytime you talked when you was stretchin the. truth. There's gonna be one more flyin' knuckle you're gunna. catch in the tooth. come here, come here you fuckin.... [Chorus : Proof]. Come here you fuckin backstabber. why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha. come here you little backstabber. why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha. [sample]. ""Fuck it, Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit. to last me clear to the ends""[2x]. [Eminem]. Come here you lil double-crossing goin behind my back. snitchin. good for nothin but trouble causin instigating fact. switcher. you were the least that i suspected. Until the puzzle well into place with every peice that. I selected. But I'll never let that crap happen again. You come backstabbin' again. catch it smack dab in the chin. that's for backstabbin a friend. cause every name in the book. wouldn't be enough. so i just figured I'd say your name in the hook. check it out, come here you fuckin..... [Chorus : Proof]. Come here you fuckin backstabber. why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha. come here you little backstabber. why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha. [sample]. ""Fuck it, Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit. to last me clear to the ends""[4x]. [Outro :Proof]. Backstabbers don't live too long. Around my way friendships betrayed. In the hood you die for that!. For those that don't love this combat and verbally say. this. This could relate to the death of a backstabber. That's like the desire to make social distant. vibration combustion of the neck. The backstabber for the female, you sleezin ass bitch. nigga!. So remember, the backstabber always loses in the end. A friend is a friend to the end. F-R-I for Fri, E-N-D a friend for the end.....yes. To eternity.....the backstabber shall never flourish. Take em out........ . By: Marineli"
fucking crazy,"Hi!. Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face. Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase. I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly. Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling. with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple. I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple. Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure. that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her. I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months. and said, ""I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"". The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell. I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell. I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs. and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns. I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach. and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it. (Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet. If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it. And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it. Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it. Chorus: Eminem. Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan. for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin. is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?. Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!. Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan. for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin. is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?. Is fuckin crazy. [Eminem]. I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin. I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym. I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias. to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens. A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium. than a maniac Saudi Arabian. A highly combustible head, spazmatic. strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed. Laid up in the hospital in critical condition. I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician. High speed, IV full of thai weed. Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese. twins, joined at the groin like lesbians. Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins. I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends. on if I keep on killin my girlfriends. Chorus: Eminem. Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan. for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin. is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?. Is fuckin crazy -- listen!!. Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan. for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin. is fuckin crazy -- you hear me?. Is fuckin crazy. [Eminem]. Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust. and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed. (Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say. I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play. I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day. of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH). Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin. Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine. Scratched my balls til I shredded skin. ""Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"". ""It's probably AIDS!"" Forget it then. I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows. that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos. So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats. and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus. Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded. My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it. Damn!."
g.o.a.t,"I?m a goat. And for those of y?all who don?t know what a goat is. It means the greatest of all time. And i consider myself one of those. So thank you very much, here it goes!. This is the part i was worried about. Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes. And i?m in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes. And everyone?s telling me what i should do. And how i should come out and what to rap about. And i know i got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that i gotta get out. And i?m not sure how this is gonna come off. They?re probably gonna think that i?m coming off as cocky (haha). Like i just started giving a fuck what you really think about me. See, the thing about me. Is you don?t really know a thing about me. Everyone?s making a stink about me. Like there?s some kind of a aura of that of the king around me. Surround me with nothin? but gangsters, killers, and bangers. And the most dangerous criminals. And i feel like i?m more comfortable around them than i do my own motherfuckin? neighbors. But, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave. Why does it seem like i?m not even put up in the same category as other emcees?. So when weezy says that he?s better than jay-z. Please, be that just subliminally. Means he thinks jigga?s the best and that he?s. The only one up in that league, see. And it?s easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is. Knowing god damn well that i?m one of the best god damn rappers that ever lived period. I?m a goat. And i don?t mean to gloat. But i know what i know and i know what you think. And these magazines?ll never put it in ink. Because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?. And for those of y?all who don?t know what a goat is. It means the greatest of all time. And i consider myself one of those. So thank you very much, here it goes!. Maybe they figure that i?m on my way out the game. So they gotta go try to find em a new eminem. Or a new shady, if they think it?s gonna happen. Man, i thought i was crazy. Or maybe i could be takin? it wrong and they?re tryna pay homage to me in a strange way. So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way. See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that paul wall?s white. Cause lyrically he doesn?t pose a threat to anyone, see, he?s just aight. And bubba sparxxx, he just won?t write. Because he?s so caught up in that snow white. That timbaland can?t even get him in the studio. He?s so gone off that coke, right. And it?s so sad, cause he?s dope, right. America?s next great white hope, right. So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show, right. And which i?m still havin? mixed feelings about. They said it?d be real, i?m just spillin? it out. There?s somethin? about a white boy talking black and runnin? around with a damn grill in his mouth. And i love when the say that tiger woods shit. ""isn?t it ironic that the best rapper?s white and the best golfer?s black?"". And i?m the one who?s gotta catch all the flack offa? that. But these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out. But i had already hit middle america. Parents had all got to likin? me now. When suddenly i wasn?t such a bad guy. All of the hatred for me must?ve died. Thought i committed career suicide so i had to turn back into the bad guy. So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays. And (?) god made raggedy ann and andy. Not raggedy andy and andy and andy. And angelina jolie is just another ho. And brad is a sucka? because once i fuck her. She wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby. You know what i say? No. You better save some of them kids from madonna. She needs all the publicity she can get. You want a shady? Well, you got it, man. I ain?t apologizin? for shit.. I?m a goat. And i don?t mean to gloat. But i know what i know and i know what you think. And these magazines?ll never put it in ink. Because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?. And for those of y?all who don?t know what a goat is. It means the greatest of all time. And i consider myself one of those. So thank you very much, here it goes!"
get you mad,"Artist: Sway and King Tech f/ Eminem. Yo.. yo! (* Eminem hachs up spit *). Mic check.. (My dick!). Testing.. one, two (* Eminem hach-spits on mic *). Ffff-fuck.. (My dick!) My nuts... My attitude is worse than NWA's was. I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people. who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does (My tattoo!). You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin,. ""Puffy is good, (HEY!) but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (WAIT!). I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it. Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like. You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway. I'm just tryin to get my porno career started. Every place and event.. +Been There, Done That+. Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went. (* zipper sound *) ""Come on, let's go!"". Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters. Lesson One: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers. Lesson Two: Face em and diss em (whattup dog?). Don't give em a demo; kidnap em (I want you to come with me). and make em come to your basement and listen. (you're gonna fuckin check this out). Lesson Three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus. and put yours on the owner's table (here listen!). Lesson Four: 'Know you heard this before'. ""Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"". Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?. Get the whitest A&R you can find. Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can. Lesson Five: Get a hook-up at Jive. Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live. And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't. givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me). Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin. cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master P (UNNNGGGGH!). Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth. my balls broke both of her collarbones (OWW!). Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (""It's all about me..""). Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea (""You're a dick!""). And all three of my main girls said SEE-YA. Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah. (What? Oh my God!) I splish splash while I'm takin a bath. Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh. White trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass (""Oh! Ooh Shady! Oooh!""). While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass. So if I hurt your self-esteem. and you get dissed too bad [Yo why you diss me?]. You know I just be sayin that to get you mad. And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had [A big dick!]. You know I just be sayin that to get you mad. ""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"". You know I just be sayin that to get you mad. ""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"" [Nurse! Nurse!]. You know I just be sayin that to get you mad. What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play. Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate. Hi Renee! (Oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade. in your driveway (WHAT?) and drive away (* car peels out *). Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS. Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache. You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though. I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow. Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (MOOOOO!). Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half. Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with +Agent Orange+. And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here!). The demon is here, steamin this year. I rip [*Mystikal's*] voicebox out, scream in his ear (AHHHHHH!). It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it. Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it. ""Yeah I don't think this guy is well.."" I'm high as hell. I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail. [* impersonating Method Man *]. I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin. Lay your nuts on the dresser. Just your nutsack by itself. And bang them shits with a spiked bat. Cut your neck off and sew your head right back. And leave you like that. You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor. Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher. Reeves, I was teething with strep throat. while your mother was breastfeeding. And gave her the flesh-eating disease. I'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees. and walkin through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans. (Am I a Blood or a Crip?) Wakin up the next day in breathin machines. Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes. on how you just got smoked, and if you do live. You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke. So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad. You know I just be sayin that to get you mad. And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had. You know I just be sayin that to get you mad. ""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad"". You know I just be sayin that to get you mad. ""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad"". You know I just be sayin that to get you mad. I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (uh-huh). That's right, Slim Shady (yup) Sway & Tech. Sprayin wreck (bitch). And we don't give a heck (uh-uh). or a damn.. or a fuck.. or a shit. So suck my motherfuckin dick"
girls,"[Eminem]. Hey yo dawg. I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest that. I need to get off cause, if I don't. I'ma fuckin explode, or somethin. Now look - this is a story about. some little fuckin girls that I know. It goes like this... It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening. People are lookin for an excuse to jump on my shitlist. Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business. I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions. Now I'm in the position that, I don't wanna be in - shit. I never had no beef with your corny son of a bitches. But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it. So I'm tellin you right now - motherFUCK a Limp Bizkit. Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real. He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see he chill. He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral. I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils. Peoples, whatever your backpackin cypherin name is. Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and. I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies. Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies. Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me. Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any. But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked. I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally. Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentionin me. That little fuckin weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV. After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV. Talkin bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?. Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song. Talkin bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?. What's wrong? You scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too. I shoulda knew better than to listen to you. You fuckin sissy, up on stage, screamin how people hate you. They don't hate you. They just think you're corny since Christina played you. And how dare you motherfuckers that try to diss me back. That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin my ass. Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song I'm tryin to pre-warn you. Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg I'm swingin on you!. Motherfuckers must think cause I'm in trouble with the law. that I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow. [Chorus]. Y'all some - girrrrls - y'all are some god damn girls. Why do you act this way? - Why do you act this way huh?. Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies. keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that. And we all knowwww - we all know, hah. How fuckin cowards rollll - ""keep rollin rollin rollin"". In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down. But as soon as someone calls you out. You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn. [Eminem]. Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs. I'm a man, I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask. is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. and I won't put you in 'em. Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs. I'm a man, I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask. . is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. and I won't put you in 'em. Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on. But if I help you sell one record. and I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked. See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends. Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them. I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim. All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in. That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre. From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away. in my coffin I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested. I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested. Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated. I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated. This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil. But I will never be this gullible ever again no (nope). Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me. I'm not bein cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin me. I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!). I say ""Fuck Christina"" he says ""Fuck Christina"" but meaner. So from doin a song with Method to beggin to get accepted. I'm peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with. And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said. I'm fuckin you up punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin. And fuck BIZKIT! Cause I know you're sayin fuck D-12. Only not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves. [Chorus]. You little - girrrrls - motherfuckin females. Why do you act this way? - Why do y'all act this way huh?. Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies. keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that. And we all knowwww - now we all know the truth. How fuckin cowards rollll - ""keep rollin rollin rollin"". In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down. But as soon as someone calls you out. You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn. [Eminem]. Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs. I'm a man, I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask. is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. and I won't put you in 'em. Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs. I'm a man, I can stand on my feet. So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask. is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion. and I won't put you in it. And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg. If you didn't wanna do the fuckin song. don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song. and then back out at the last minute. And then go on motherfuckin MTV talkin about. Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass. If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog. just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it. That's all you had to fuckin say, I wouldn'ta said shit. I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin song myself. and not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all. Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more. I'm on some fuckin-you-up shit when I see you. And I will see you too; oh, and by the way Fred. That wasn't an accident. I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards."

Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work. For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough. Cuz we, are just gonna be, enemies. As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us. Coming to terms, where we can agree. There ain't gonna be, no reason, speakin wit me. You speak on my seed, then me, no speak Englais. So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin, unless.

going through changes,"(hook). I'm going through changes. I'm going through changes. (verse 1). Lately, I really feel like I'm rolling for delph like philly. Feel like I'm losing control of myself. I sincerely Apologize if all that I sound like. Is I am complaining. But life keeps on complicating. And I'm debating on leaving this world this evening. Even my girls can see I'm grieving. I try and hide it, but I can't. Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty. When inside I'm dying. I am finally realizing, I need help. Can't do it myself, too weak. Two weeks I've been having ups and downs, going. Through peaks and valleys. Dilly-dallying 'round with the idea of ending this Shit right here. I'm hating my reflection, I walk around the house. Tryin' to fight mirrors. I can? t stand what I look like, here, I look fat. But what do I care? I could give a fuck. Only thing I fear is hailie. I'm afraid if I close my eyes then I might see her, shit. (hook). I'm going through changes. I'm going through changes. (verse 2). I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, napping at noon. Yeah, dad's in a bad mood. he's always snapping at you. Marshall what happened that you. can't stop with these pills. And you've fallen off with your skills. And your own fans are laughing at you. You've become a problem you're too pussy to tackle. Get up, be a man, stand. A real man would of had this shit handled. Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed. They say proof just flipped out. Homie just whipped out and bust, nah. It isn't like dudey to do that, he wouldn't fuckin. Shoot at nobody, he'd fight first. But dwelling on it only makes the night worse. Now I'm popping vics, percs and methadone pills. ""yeah em, tight verse, you killed it"". Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes-men. And they gonna do whatever I says when, I says it. It's in their best interest to protect their investment. And I just lost my fucking best friend, so fuck it I guess then. (hook). I'm going through changes. I'm going through changes. Don't know what I'm gonna do. But I just keep on going through changes. (verse 3). My friends can't understand this new me, that's. Understandable, man. But think how bananas. you'd be, you'd be an animal too. If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo. And everybody's lookin? at you. what you want me to do?. I'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is. Fame is starting to give me an excuse. to be at a all time low. I sit alone in my home theater. Watching the same damn dvd of the first tour. The last tour, he was still alive and it hurts. So I fast forward. sleeping pills will make me feel alright. And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night. I just take a couple more, yeah. you're motherfucking right. I ain't slowing down for no one. I am almost homeward bound. Almost in a coma, yeah homie. come on dole 'em out. ""daddy don't you die on me. Daddy better hold your ground! "". Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice. Yeah baby, hold me down. (hook). I'm going through changes. I'm going through changes. Don't know what I'm gonna do. But I just keep on going through changes. (verse 4). Wake up in the hospital full of tubes. Plus somehow I'm pulling through. Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof. I'mma do it just for proof. I think I should state a few facts. 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth. Shit it just hit me that what if. I would not have made it through. I think about the things. I would have never got to say to you. I'd never get to make it right. so here's what I came to do. Hailie this one is just for you, whitney and elaina too. I still love your mother, that will never change. Think about her every day. We just could never get it together. Hey, wish there was a better way for me to say it. But I swear on everything. I'll do anything for her on any day. There are just too many things to explain. When it rains, guess it pours. Yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain. But I can't pretend there ain't. I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers. Heaven knows I never been a saint. I know that it feels like we just pissed away our History. and just today I looked at your picture, almost hate to say. I miss you, sub-consciously. Wish it didn't end this way, but I just had to get Away. Don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm. (hook). I'm going through changes. Don't know what I'm gonna do. But I just keep on going through changes. I'm going through changes"
good guy (feat. jessie reyez),"Here we go again. From heroes to villains. Used to be your Romeo. But we both were jilted. A couple of times. So we had a slippery slope to deal with. But still it gave me hope. That we'll get through it together. A severed earlobe. Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope. Would be dope, but. What kind of lengths can you go?. Pull a Vincent Van Gogh. Just to convince a damn ho. To be a housewife who outright lies. She's blackout drunk. Now she's backin' out my drive. I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?. She's just about my size. Hit me in the mouth twice. Guys, when someone you die for. sticks a steak knife in your heart. Do you try more?. Another late night in. She stumbles through my door. Lets the daylight in. And all we do's fight more. And I ain't violent. But she's goin' through my drawers. To plant the K-Y in. I'm gettin' accused by a whore. Who smells like St. Ides and. Who has probably screwed five more guys. sucked eight, nine men. I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens. Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win. Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in. And here's some two-ply for. When you date my friends. in order to wipe your ass. When you moved your bowels. When we renewed our vows. This the thanks I get. I'm waitin' for the date I can hear you say. ""Marshall, what a skank I've been. And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him"". Got your tubes tied for him. Got that boob job for him. Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in. After you, I swore to make the gray skies end. Here come the rays like wind. You get a pay hike and. Am I the good guy or do I just play like him. And hope that he dumps you?. It's like a dream come true. Just to scream ""Fuck you! "". Guess you take life in the same way. you play dice then. 'Cause you just look at me. and roll them little snake eyes in. Since. Since you bought the jury. They'll call me guilty. They'll call me guilty. You bought the jury. They'll call me guilty. Even though you know the real me. You can't beat a cheater. Convince a nonbeliever. And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out. But I let you say that you're the good guy. 'Cause this ain't what love looks like. You can't beat a cheater. Convince a nonbeliever. I ain't in my feelings, I'm out. But I let you say that you're the good guy. They like, ""You're the good guy. "". They like, they like, they like. ""You're the good guy. """

guts over fear (feat. sia),"Feels like a close, it's coming to. Fuck am I gonna do?. It's too late to start over. This is the only thing I, thing I know. Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is. Find different ways to word the same old song. Ever since I came along. From the day the song called ""Hi! My Name Is"" dropped. Started thinking my name was fault. Cause anytime things went wrong. I was the one who they would blame it on. The media made me the equivalent. Of a modern-day Genghis Kahn. Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg. Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls. Had to change my style. They said I'm way too soft. And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws. And the fangs been out since then. But up until the instant that I went against it. It was ingrained in me. That I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought. No wonder I had to unlearn everything. That my brain was taught. Do I really belong in this game? I pondered. I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?. So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on. And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect. The artform I was raised upon. But sometimes you gotta take a loss. And have people rub it in your face before. You get made pissed off. And keep pluggin' it's your only outlet. And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it. Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah. Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times. How many times can I say the same thing. Different ways that rhyme?. What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else. That can relate to my story?. Bet you feel the same way I felt. When I was in the same place you are. When I was afraid to. [Sia]. Afraid to make a single sound. Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out. Afraid I'd never be found. I don't wanna go another round. An angry man's power will shut you up. Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love. Run out of excuses for everyone. So here I am and I will not run. Guts over fear, the time is near. Guts over fear, I shed a tear. For all the times I let you push me round. And let you keep me down, now I've got. Guts over fear, guts over fear. [Eminem]. Feels like a close, it's coming to. Fuck am I gonna do?. It's too late to start over. This is the only thing I, thing I know. It's like I was there once, single parents. Hate your appearance. Did you struggle to find your place in this world?. And the pain spawns all the anger on. But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs. Learned who to aim it on. That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit. Learned how to harness it. While the reins were off. And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part. Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck"". Haters started to appreciate my art. And it just breaks my heart. To look at all the pain I've caused. But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?. The lights go out in the trailer park. And the window that was closing. And there's nowhere else I can go with flows in. And I'm frozen. Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from. Just a bunch of playful songs. That I made for fun. So to the break of dawn here. I go recycling the same old song. But I'd rather make"" Not Afraid 2"". Than another mothafuckin' ""We Made You"" uh. Now I don't wanna seem indulgent. When I discuss my lows and my highs. My demise and my uprise, pray to God. I just opened enough eyes later on. Gave you the supplies and the tools. To hopefully use it to make you strong. Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt. Cause I can't explain to y'all. How dang exhausted my legs felt. Just having to balance my damn self. Those dang eggshells, I was made to walk. But thank you ma, cause that gave me the strength. To cause Shady-mania. So when they empty that stadium. At least I made it out of that house. And a found a place in this world when the day was done. So this is for every kid who all's they ever did. Was dreamt that one day they would just get accepted. I represent him or her, anyone similar. You are the reason I made this song. Everything you're scared to say. Don't be afraid to say no more. From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk. Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off. The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you. When I'm gone. And to think I was. [Sia]. Afraid to make a single sound. Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out. Afraid I'd never be found. I don't wanna go another round. An angry man's power will shut you up. Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love. Run out of excuses for everyone. So here I am and I will not run. Guts over fear, the time is near. Guts over fear, I shed a tear. For all the times I let you push me round. And let you keep me down, now I've got. Guts over fear, guts over fear"

Press tight on the trigger of this glock. Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat. You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep. You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac.

hailie's song,"I can't sing it. I feel like singin'. I wanna (*fuckin'*) sing. 'Cuz I'm happy. Yeah, I'm happy. Ha Ha. I got my baby back. Yo, check it out. Verse 1. Somedays I sit (sit), starin' out the window. Watchin' this world pass me by. Sometimes I think (think) there's nothin' to live for (for). I almost break down and cry. Sometimes I think I'm crazy. I'm crazy, oh so crazy. Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?. But then I see my baby. Suddenly I'm not crazy. It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no). Chorus. Sometimes It feels like the world's on my shoulders. Everyone's leanin' on me. 'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over. But then she comes back to me. Verse 2. My baby girl(girl)(Hailie laughs) keeps gettin' older. I watch her grow up with pride. People make jokes (jokes), 'cuz they don't understand me (me). They just don't see my real side. I act like (*shit*) don't phase me,. Inside it drives me crazy. My insecurities could eat me alive. But then I see my baby. Suddenly I'm not crazy. It all makes sense when I look into her eyes. Chorus. . Verse 3. Yeah and if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter. If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father. To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er. God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *censored* (abort her). . Now you prob'ly get this picture from my public persona. That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama,. But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest. 'Cuz there's a lot of (*shit*) I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul,. And just know that I grow colder the older I grow. This boulder on my shoulder that gets heavy and harder to hold. And this load is like the weight of the world. And I think my neck is breakin' should I just give up. Or try to live up to these expectations? now look,. I love my daughter more than life in itself,. But I got a wife who's determined to make my life livin' hell. But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt. So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else. But the years that I've wasted are nothin' to the tears that I've tasted. So here's what I'm facin': 3 felonies, 6 years of probation. I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman. I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman. Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?. Woulda ripped the pre-nup if I'd seen what she was (*fuckin'*). But (*fuck*) it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more. I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie. So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya. My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner. And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted. It's like the greatest gift you can get. The weight has been lifted. (Chorus 2). Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders. Everyone's leanin' on me. Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier. Nothin' can take her from me. Outro - Spoken. Woo!. I told you, I can't sing.. Oh well, I tried. Hailie, remember when I said. If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?. Well guess what, daddy's here.. And I ain't goin' nowhere baby. I love you (kiss). . By Ari szz"

People Say that im a bad influence. i say the worlds already fucked im just addin to it. they say im suicidal teenagers newest idol. come on!. do as i do. go ahead get mad and do it. (just pull the plug). Hand me an 8 beam me up and land me in space. i'ma sit on top of the world and shit on brandy and mase. im more then ill scarier then a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill. human horror film. but with a lot funnier plot and people who feel me cuz i'ma still be the mad rapper weather i got money or not as long as im on pills and i got plenty of pot i'll be in a cannoe paddling making fun of your yatch. but i would like an award for the best rapper to get one mic and a source. and a woredrobe i can afford otherwise i might just send up. \""pack striking at ford\"" and you wonder what the fuck i need more vicoden for. everybody's pissing me off even a No Limit tank looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off. no shit im in grave danger to my health why else would i kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself. Course. im the illest rapper to hold the \""cordless\"" patroling corners looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters. im meaner in action then \""rosco\"" beating james \""star\"" Sr. across the back with vaccuum cleaner attachments. i grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth with a fucked up childhood that i use as an excuse and ain't shit changed i kept the same mindstate. since the 3rd time i failed 9th grade. you probably think im a negative person dont be so sure of it i dont promote violence i just encourage it i laugh at the sight of death as i fall down a cement flight of steps and land aside a bed of spider webs. so throw caution to the wind you and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again (Shit) why not blow your brain out im blowing mine out fuck it you only live once you might as well die now [just let it go]. Course. my laser disc will make you take a razor to your wrist Make you satanistic. Make you take the pistol to your face. And place the clip and cock it back. And let it go until your brains. are rippin' out your skull so bad. to sew you back and be a waste of stitches. I'm not a Role Model, I don't wanna babysit kids. I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business. And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off. Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin me to dishwash. I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got. You made me get a bigger attitude than 80 Kim scotts. And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got. I know that Just the Two of Us would make you hate me this much. And Just the Two of Us. That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life. It's just words on a mic.. So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig. But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch"

headlights (feat. nate ruess),"Mom. I know I let you down. And though you say the days are happy. Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?. Mom. I know he's not around. But don't you place the blame on me. As you pour yourself another drink. I guess we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on. Maybe we took this too far. I went in headfirst. Never thinking about who what I said hurt. In what verse. My mom probably got it the worst. The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are. Did I take it too far?. ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" and all them other songs. But regardless I don't hate you cause ma!. You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom. Though far be it for you to be calling. My house was Vietnam. Desert storm and both of us put together. Can form an atomic bomb equivalent. To chemical warfare. And forever we can drag this on and on. But, agree to disagree. That gift from me up under the Christmas tree. Don't mean shit to me. You're kicking me out?. It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve. (little prick just leave). Ma, let me grab my fucking coat. Anything to have each other's goats. Why we always at each others throats?. Especially when dad, he fucked us both. We're in the same fucking boat. You'd think that it'd make us close (nope). Further away it drove us. But together headlights shine, a car full of belongings. Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house. It's straight up the road. And I was the man of the house, the oldest. So my shoulders carried the weight of the load. Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and. That's when I realized you were sick. And it wasn't fixable or changable. And to this day we remained estranged. And I hate it though, but. I guess we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on. Maybe we took this too far. Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though. Cause you ain't even get to witness. Your grand baby's growth. But I'm sorry mama for ""Cleaning Out My Closet"". At the time I was angry. Rightfully maybe so. Never meant that far to take it though, cause. Now I know it's not your fault. And I'm not making jokes. That song I no longer play at shows. And I cringe every time it's on the radio. And I think of Nathan being placed in a home. And all the medicine you fed us. And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but. Now the medications taken over. And your mental states deteriorating slow. And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though. But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo. All you did, all you said. You did your best to raise us both. Foster care, that cross you bare. Few may be as heavy as yours. But I love you Debbie Mathers. Oh what a tangled web we have, cause. One thing I never asked was. Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was. Fuck it I guess he had trouble. Keeping up with every address. But I'd rather of flipped every mattress. Every rock and desert cactus. Own a collection of maps and followed my kids. To the edge of the atlas. Someone ever moved them from me?. That you could bet your ass's. If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa. Kidnap them. And although one has met their grandma. Once you pulled up in our drive one night. As we were leaving to get some hamburgers. Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you. And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness. Come over me. As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and. I saw your headlights as I looked back. And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to. Thank you for being my mom and my dad. So Mom, please accept this as a tribute. I wrote this on the jet. I guess I had to get this off my chest. I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead. The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt. I guess we're crashing. So if I'm not dreaming. I hope you get this message. That I'll always love you from afar. Cause you're my mama. I guess we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on. Maybe we took this too far. I want a new life. One without a cause. So I'm coming home tonight. Well, no matter what the cost. And if the plane goes down. And if the crew can't wake me up. Well, just know that I'm alright. And I was not afraid to die. Even if there's songs to sing. My children will carry me. Just know that I'm alright. I was not afraid to die. Because I put my faith in my new girl. So I never say goodbye cruel world. Just know that I'm alright. I am not afraid to die. I guess we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on. Maybe we took this too far. I want a new life"

It's something to see. But just like a girl. who thinks her coochie doesn't stink. If she ain't planning to do. shit, this summer's eve. Maybe she wants to keep me company. But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit. ""Ain't stepping to you bitch,"". I say to myself. Plus she's bumping my music,. ain't chasing no tail. Like a skunk in heat. I could sweat her, to some degree. But fuck it, I'm the male,. let her come to me. Let her come to me,. male sweater, some degree, fail. Fuck it, pull up beside her. Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her. What is a [?].

Come jump in the water,. I bet you get your self esteem. From your persona. With an ass to match, girl,. your body is lit. You're striking, I'm a gas. Girl, you're just gonna have to. put the mother chumps on the back burner. You got buns,. I got Asperger's. Just let me rest my head in. between that set of Ds. While I shred Mcs. like cheddar cheese. That's just the thoroughbred. in me, ain't a better breed. My dog thinks so, too,. look at my pedigree. Ma, the world is what I think of you. I think you're divine, so. I might swing on you. I'm just kidding girl,. I wouldn't lift a finger or two. Unless it's the middle one,. to finger you. All day, all day, all night. You ask, I stay the night. With you, you say you're fire. Me too, you're burning up. I'm running-. Feel, feel, feel, feel,. feel, my heat. . On the ones and twos, threes. and four in (the morning). Rick's in the cut like Neosporin (what?). He's mixing it up for me and Lauren. A teddy like short for Theodore. We're outtie, five thousand. Who the fuck? It's my big dick.

hell breaks loose (feat. dr. dre),"[Eminem]. I want you to understand something. That when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans. jumping,. I want the fist pumping in the air,. I don?t look like a millionnaire,. But I feel like a million bucks,. Ladies won't ya fill your cups,. Shady?s come to fill ya up,. If your a D or a C cup. You can even be a B. It's just me and Dre. You?ll be in the Er we?ll be strapped with so much. Tnt,. We may blow no not even Cpr from the Emt. Could help you to resuscitate. You busters must be flustered wait. You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem Can?t you bust a grape,. What's my name, shady came and just crushed the game,. It's really not even fair to them,. Cos they pale in comparisons. So much they might as well wear a skin,. Don't you just wish you could share his pen. Cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,. The fog is stinking the air is thin,. Cos he won't even let them try to breathe,. Da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,. Girl you just hit the lottery,. [Chorus]. Now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,. And hell breaks loose,. Try to restrain us you can't contain us,. We still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,. Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse to just cut loose,. So this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on. And hell breaks loose,. [Dr Dre]. This is when sh-ts hits the fan,. Like it just splattered on stan. This is the only moment that matters,. Ya homie rolled in with Mathers,. Like chaos erupts Em?s in back Dre?s in the front. So do what we say at once this songs like a Seance, it haunts,. [Eminem]. It makes em stay in a trance. No choice they have to dance,. [Dr Dre]. It's like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt. Take a day off of what man you better lay off the. blunts. You must be smoking something. You think I ain't smoking nothing stay off my nuts,. Now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the. rust,. Shake all them cobwebs loose,. Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,. Yeah girl shake that caboose. I don?t wanna see you try to make no excuse,. Dre is on the loose,. A Mongoose when it's comes to the chronic use,. You know I can?t stand to lose,. Me and my goons are like animals,. We come through like a pack of wolves,. So we came here to retract the roof,. Yeah man ain't that the truth,. Girl your man?s like in the booth. Definitely back up in this b-tch,. This is when all hell breaks loose,. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,. A murderer in the flow, liquid courage I'm finna blow. As soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe. I?m sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,. We?re in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,. Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,. With speakers knocking it's 3 o'clock. Me and Doc then proceed to drop E. And hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,. [Dr Dre]. Yeah so let us in ?fore we huff and puff and we blow,. We ain't bluffin for nothing. We?ll knock the stuffing out ya. Revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet. Yeah move or lose it three,. Move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,. Pass some of that (?) lil right there,. That would be pretty stupid to me,. Born and raised in the Cpt,. Yeah Los Angeles who?s in the streets,. Them haters hating on me,. But I refuse to lose any sleep,. Keep that deuce deuce in the seat,. Dre fall off that's news to me,. [Chorus]"
hellbound,"[Announcer]. Welcome back, to the stage of history. [Eminem]. Yo.. Slim Shady!. Yo.. {*words reversed*}. I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww). Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to. The only key that I see to defeat you. would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you. and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe. I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse. you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you. (Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal. I ain't tryin to shoot you,. I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you. Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass. and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress. Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!). Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis. I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket. to fill it full of explosive gasses. and close it back with a lit match in it. while I sit back and just hope it catches. Blow you to fragments. Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes. Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2x). I see the light at the end. But every time I take a step, it gets dim. Tell me is this hell we're livin in?. If so, heaven's got to be better. But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down. [J-Black]. Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never). I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse. I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc. Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot. One day we all gon' die. But when I die, I'ma be so high. that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare. with the chalk outline still there. I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot. I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock. Now if I pray everynight (night). Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?. You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth. I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse. I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse. Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk. See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface. Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith. Angels greet me but I don't reply back. Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?. Chorus 1/2. [Announcer]. Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns. Final battle, fight!. [Masta Ace]. Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso. Call me a lost soul, with a vest and my torso. And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger. Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger. I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound. And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds. My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger. Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her. Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her. Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager. My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel. My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel. Everyday I grow more older, and more colder. Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder. I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare. Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care. Chorus. [J-Black]. But every time I take a step, it gets dim... Tell me is this hell we're livin in?. Haha... [Announcer]. Time's up!. You lose!"
hello,"[Intro:]. Hello... Allow me to introduce myself... My name is, Shady.. It's so nice to meet you...It's been a long time.... Sorry I've been away so long.... My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you. [Verse 1:]. You see that chick in the gym, checkin' me out. Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth. I lose a pill, and I'm wrecklessly wreckin' the house. That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?. There's the neckless I lost right next to Stephanie's blouse. Man I should check to see if my mom left any out. Nope, guess I'll re-route. Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch. Opp, jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth. Down the hatchet, and the feelin' you can't match it. I rat-tat-tap on your door with the damn ratchet. Ata-tac-tacking' a whore with the damn hatchet. A knapsack pack with like 40some Xanax's. Shorty come back, I'm tryn' score me some lap dances. I'm bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniels. Forumla 44D and 40's with mad capsules. The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya. [Chorus:]. Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello. And are you menstruating baby, my lil' friends waitin' to say Hello. The way your titties are wiggling and your booties shakin' like jello. Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello. [Verse 2:]. Yeah. My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium. I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em. It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum. No reason inparticular, it was strictly fun. a 5th of rum and 2 bottles of 151. 51 people asleep in my damn living room. Excuse me hun, but what is your name, Vivienne?. I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um. Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy hun?. I'm looking for the torn rapper but there don't seem to be one. No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm. [ Eminem Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]. But disease is something I'm tryna keep my penis free from. I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run. Like Speedy Gonzales, see if I see anyone. Who might have a couple of 3's I'm fiendin' for some. My head is pounding to the beat of the drum. [Chorus:]. Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello. And do ya happen to have anything on ya to make my mood mellow?. Some are oval and some are pink,. some are blue and some are just yellow. Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello. [Verse 3:]. Oh, those were the days, they certainly were. It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' that curtain for good. Word, word, word, word, word, word, word. I second that and a third, rushed to emergency surgery. To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased. He's no longer getting them free, 100 bucks for these Percodans. Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully searched the den. Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him. Tirelessly on the phone trying to russle up, muscle relaxants. For his back, and a couple of Pax's, now he's doubling backwards. And he's stumbling back, slipped and fell, hit his back bone. Heard something go crack, Now he's up in the bathroom. Like he's busting a nap, almost ended it that soon. Because of the fact, I'm just busting my own chops. While I'm busting a rap, resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it I'm back. [Chorus:]. Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello. And do ya happen to have anything on ya to make my mood mellow?. Some are oval and some are pink,. some are blue and some are just yellow. Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello. [Outro:]. And so I'm sayin' Hello... Allow me to introduce myself.... My name is, Shady.. It's so nice to meet you...It's been a long time.... Sorry I've been away so long.... My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you. by: Guigs. Corrigido by: Luiz Eduardo Simas"

how come,"[Intro]. So I chose, huh. You got a phone,. Pick it up and call me. [Chorus:]. How come, we don't even talk no mo',. And you don't even call no mo',. We don't barely keep in touch at all,. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',. And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,. After all the years we've been down,. Ain't no way, no how,. This bullshit can't be true,. We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you. [Verse One]. We were so young,. So full of life and vivrance,. Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went,. So close or most us some Bonnie and Clyde shit,. When Ronnie died you was right by my side,. With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,. And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,. You even had the same type of childhood I did,. Sometimes I just wanna know why,. Is it that you sur-came to yours,. And mine I survived it,. You ran the streets I nine to fived it,. We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,. Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,. Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,. Much as your pride tries to hide it,. You're cold your touch is just like ice,. And your eyes is the look of resentment,. I can sense it and I don't like it. [Chorus]. (Kon Artis). [Verse Two]. It was my dream at first to be all spittin the verse,. On my own album with a deal but shit got worse,. So I came out I would'a killed a nigga first,. 'Fore I let him disrespect me,. Or check me up with somethin' worse,. Some bitch that I wasn't with,. I would'a hit her to would'a quit,. But you were plain talkin' to her,. And tell her she was the shit,. I told you don't get involved with her,. You were smoking the cron'c with her,. Coming out'a the bar with her,. Stumblin' hands drunk,. Like Devil's husband or wife or somthin',. But me catchin' he fuckin' other nigga,. Must've hurt your pride or somthin',. 'Cause you wolf I fit them after people,. Like you want it with me,. When all I tried to do is show you that your bitch was shifty,. And lyrics is the fans and all the shit that I produce,. You actin' like I ain't your man,. And lyin' like she can't be loose,. But I am really your friend,. I'm just trying to tell you the truth,. Don't hate the game or the playa',. The one that's changin is you. [Chorus]. (Proof). [Verse Three]. We gettin lonely at the top. cuz my homie had to stop. now we actin like I gotta live only for the block. and homies in the hood only see me on the tube. so they gossip on the porch, get ta speakin all rude. fools I used to rap with, all expect magic. like my finger get ta snappin and *poof* it just happen. but Proof its just actin, at the party were stoned. shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home. see the devil in your grin, since the ghetto we been friends. forever, real intelegience, thats forever till the end. I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lie. aint wastin my time with these snakes in disguise. (How come) when you talk its with bitter respite. (And how come) its my fault for what you did with your life. and every time I go to hear you and play you look away. we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face"
i love you more,"You still love me?. Take this.... 2 guns cock. You ready ? 1.. 2.. 3! 2 bangs. [Chorus]. The more you, put me through,. The more it makes me wanna come back to you,. You say you hate me, I just love you more,. You don't want me, I just want you more,. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,. I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,. Cuz you love me, and I love you more.. [Eminem]. It's sick, but who could ever predict,. We'd be doin' the same shit,. We say we do it for our baby but we don't,. We do it for us, it's lust,. Cuz neither one of us trusts each other,. So we fuck 'til we bust,. Then we cuss each other, out,. We know what it's about,. Shout 'til I throw you out the house,. You throw me out the house,. I throw you on the couch,. Punch you in the mouth,. Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,. And apologize after,. Laughter, pain, it's insane,. We're back in the same chapter again,. And it's sad but it's true,. When I'm layin' here with you,. There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.. [Chorus]. The more you, put me through,. The more it makes me wanna come back to you,. You say you hate me, I just love you more,. You don't want me, I just want you more,. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,. I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,. Cuz you love me, and I love you more.. . [Eminem]. Cuz I hate you, do you hate me?. Good cuz you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,. It makes me wanna just take you,. And just throw you on the bed,. And fuck you like I don't even know you,. You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,. You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,. We're both evil in our ways,. But neither one of us would ever admit it,. Cuz one of us would have one up on the other,. So forget it,. We can make accusations, people spread rumors,. But they ain't got proof,. 'Til they do it's just the two of us,. It's you and me, cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me,. But you gotta believe me to a degree,. Cuz if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,. Yeah I would cuz the sex is too damn good,. If I ran who would I run to,. That would be this soft and warm,. So it's off and on, usually more off than on,. But at least we know that we share this common bond,. You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,. I hope, the only reason that I cope,. Is cuz of that fact,. And plus I can bust in that,. And that's why.... [Chorus]. The more you, put me through,. The more it makes me wanna come back to you,. You say you hate me, I just love you more,. You don't want me, I just want you more,. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,. I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,. Cuz you love me, and I love you more.. [Eminem]. I could never understand it,. That's why I don't try,. >From junior high until we both die,. It's silly ho why must we try,. Is it really so rough,. That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,. Try to pull each other's legs,. Until the other begs,. We're liein' to ourselves,. That's the beauty of it yeah,. Cuz we truly love each other,. That's why we always fight,. And all we do is shove each other,. Every other fuckin' night,. And it's clear it ain't gonna change,. It's pent up rage,. We both have,. We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,. We've both been,. Someone else's someone else,. Problem is neither one wants help,. It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,. Our family's mixed up,. There's a baby sister in the mix,. And it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,. And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,. And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,. On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,. All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,. What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,. But I won't be made a fool of,. If this is true love,. You wouldn't do what,. You did last time,. You wouldn't screw up,. This time,. Cuz this time girl,. I'm tellin you what,. You do it again I'm fuckin you up,. No matter what.... [Bridge]. What you say, what you do,. I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,. No matter where you run, I'll be right there,. Right behind you, in your nightmares,. All the flowers, and the candy,. All the times that you threw it back at me,. You say you hate me, you gon' hate me more,. When you find out, can't escape me whore.. [Chorus]. The more you, put me through,. The more it makes me wanna come back to you,. You say you hate me, I just love you more,. You don't want me, I just want you more,. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,. I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,. Cuz you love me, and I love you more."
i need a doctor,"[Chorus]. I'm about to lose my mind. You've been gone for so long. I'm running out of time. I need a doctor. Call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor. To bring me back to life. [Eminem]. I told the world, one day I would pay it back.. Say it on tape and lay it, record it,. so that one day I could play it back.. But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that.. Doubt startin' to creep in,. everyday it's just so grey and black.. Hope, I just need a ray of that. 'Cause no one sees my vision. When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack.. But they don't know what dope is.. And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this.. All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest.. You picked me up, breathed new life in me.. I owe my life to you.. Before the life of me,. I don't see why you don't see like I do.. But it just dawned on me; you lost a son.. See this light in you? It's dark.. Let me turn on the lights. and brighten me and enlighten you.. I don't think you realize what you mean to me,. not the slightest clue.. 'Cause me and you, we're like a crew.. I was like your sidekick.. You gon' either wanna fight. when I get off this f-cking mic,. Or you gon' hug me.. But I'm out of options,. there's nothing else I can do cause.... [Chorus]. I'm about to lose my mind. You've been gone for so long. I'm running out of time. I need a doctor. Call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor. To bring me back to life. [Eminem]. It hurts when I see you struggle.. You come to me with ideas.. You say that these are pieces, so I'm puzzled.. 'Cause the sh-t I hear is crazy,. But you're either getting lazy,. or you don't believe in you no more.. Seems like your own opinions,. not one you can form.. Can't make a decision,. you keep questioning yourself,Second guessing,. and it's almost like your begging for my help.. Like, I'm YOUR leader.. You're supposed to f-cking be MY mentor.. I can endure no more!. I demand you remember who you are!. It was YOU, who believed in me,. When everyone was telling you, don't sign me.. Everyone at the f-cking label,. let's tell the truth.. You risked your career for me,. I know it as well as you.. Nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy.... Dre, I'm crying in this booth.. You saved my life,. now maybe it's my time to save yours.. But I can never repay you,. what you did for me is way more.. But I ain't giving up faith,. and you ain't giving up on me.. Get up Dre! I'm dying,. I need you, come back for f-ck's sake. [Chorus]. I'm about to lose my mind. You've been gone for so long. I'm running out of time. I need a doctor. Call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor. To bring me back to life.... [Dr Dre]. It literally feels like a lifetime ago. But I still remember the sh-t. like it was just yesterday though. You walked in, yellow jump suit. Whole room, cracked jokes. Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke. Went through friends,. some of them I put on. But they just left,. they said was riding to the death. But where the f-ck are they now. Now that I need them, I don't see none of them. All I see is Slim. F-ck all you fairweather friends. All I need is him. F-cking backstabbers. When the chips were down, you just laughed at us. Now you bout to feel the f-cking wrath of aftermath, faggots. You gon' see us in our lab jackets. and ask where the f-ck we been?. You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots. and the crackers ass. Little cracker jack beat making wack math,. Backwards producers, I'm back bastards. One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags. and as I leave. And I guarantee they'll scream,. Dre don't leave us like that man cause.... [Chorus]. Im about to lose my mind. You've been gone for so long. I'm running out of time. I need a doctor. Call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor. To bring me back to life"

I remember back when you had the knack. (had the knack) (hahahahaha). And I remember when you had your first heart attack. (heart attack). (*wheezing noise). I was right there laughin' when i heard the news. (heard the news). I just wish the cardiac would've murdered you. (would've murdered you). (damn). Maybe Ice T's right, you are a bitch.

I remember how it was. (what?). How it was when you were young.. Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago). Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now dont nobody wanna hear your. old ass sing no more. (Yo yo yo yo yo yo). Remember back in '94,. Like right before Miss Everlast was Whitey Ford,. Before his heart attack had him on life support. (beep beep). When house of pain was out of fame,. Like someone doused the flame,. And they became destined. To never jump around again.. Or even further back,. When I first had heard the knack,. When you were down with syndicate.. I went to get the shit,. Man I was into it.. But then you went, and took your style, and switched the shit.. Now you sound ridiculous.. You dickless piece of shit.. How could you diss me bitch? (huh?). I liked you.. Thought you was alright for a white dude.. Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you,. Started rhymin' then you left the room and didnt say goodbye or nuthin.. Like you mad that someone else was white and tryin' ta rhyme. or somethin'.. I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin ta steal your light or nuthin.. But your a homosexual, white rappin' Irish (unknown). Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a (unknown) too.. Then I'd be confused as you,. And I wouldn't know what to do.. What's up witchu?. I never fucked witchu,. Why would you fuck with me?. Knowin' I could rap circles around you,. What? Is you nuts as me?. Plus I can sing better than you,. And I don't fuckin' sing.. And probably play guitar better,. And I aint never touched a string.. But I aint mad at you.. I'd hate me too if I was you.. I'm what you used to be.. Shit you was me in '92.. So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you.. And maybe that'll help me know what it's like to sing the blues.. (ladi da). Cuz I remember all those years.. How it was when you were here. (I know). I remember how it was. (how it was). How it was when you were young. (when you were young). Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago). Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now dont nobody wanna hear your. old ass sing no more.. Cuz I remember all those years. (what). How it was when you were here. (come on). I remember how it was. (how it was). How it was when you were young.. Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago). Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now dont nobody wanna hear your. old ass sing no more.. Fuckin homo (pussy). Fuckin faggot sissy (fuck). And by the way,. 380's a fuckin' sissy gun. (homo).

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes] (Eminem). Listen, now every time I come and I hit you niggaz with shit regardless. You get retarded and then the niggaz ain't got a clue. On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say. And spit what I spit you ain't never even gotta question who. Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come. And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin zoo. Then I come and I spit all crazy sh-sh-sh-shit. And m-m-m-make n-n-niggaz do exactly what I want 'em to. From my point of view instead of trying to step up. you still trying to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew. These niggaz panick and freakin get schizophrenic and let they emotions out. And I doubt they can ever test my crew. Take a second check it I wreckon my records are better than. Whatever record you recorded that's why ya shit is through (WOO!!!). You fuckin idiot I don't think you get it. I'm one of the greatest ever period every syllable is true. [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision. I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see. No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort.

Shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo. You do not have a fightin chance to move you you were covered in my poo-poo. Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do. G-g-g-goobers secluded you. You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do do you. So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have an a-chew. You just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these. Please excuse me my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott. Your probably wonderin why there's thunderin everyone. Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block. Cause Bus a Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club. With shady quietly tryin not to start up a riot with Doc. But since we always started we might as well have a party. So gather 'round everybody come on lets get our drink on. And you ain't got to do nothin special for this occasion. Just reach in the closet put somethin on and get to the club. [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision. I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see. No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort. You niggaz can never ever really fuck with me. Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two. And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll. [Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]. Catch you niggaz and snatch you niggaz you bunch of bumblin fools. Who got me rumblin dudes all way down the block. Keep on stumblin and jumblin over their words and vowels. Throw in the towel see you niggaz is on the clock. And you runnin out of time see I'm tired of all y'all. M-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin n-n-nigga I got it locked. Every single time you put my shit in your cd player and turn up the volume. You bang your head because your shit is not. I - continue with crumblin niggaz and tumblin niggaz. You struggle while I humble a nigga with the glock. Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin while I got you tr-tr-tremblin. For one of my niggaz bust ya head with a rock. Before I start to do another thing then to make you crown me the king. With such a butter swing nigga follow the flock. Now watch my brotha bring all my diamonds to summer bling. while I'm climbin and fuck her then tell you bitch to get off my yacht. [Chorus: Busta Rhymes]. Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision. I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see. No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort. You niggaz can never ever really fuck with me. Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two. And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll"
i'll shit on you,"[Eminem - 4x]. I'll Shit On You. Da da, da da, da da. [Eminem]. I'll Shit On You. I will Shit On You. I'll Shit On You. Girl you know its true. I'll Shit On You. Bitch or man. I'll Shit On You. I will Shit On You. [Swifty]. I remain fatter than gluttony. Taping bombs to the back of record companies. Blow them up if they ain't want me. The National Guard, they scared to hunt me. I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me. A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana. These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner. I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas. You can act a fool if you wanna (bitch). It's this lyrical piranha. Strapped with a grenade, in the pool with your mama. Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom. Twist nothin up like a condom. Slap it if you fuckers got a problem. When I see them, you hoes ending up in a fuckin mausoleum. Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM. Pull in the garage while you screamin. Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll Shit On You!). I'll shit on you!. Chorus: Eminem. I will shit on you I don't care who you are. (I'll Shit On You!). I don't give a fuck about you or your car. (I'll Shit On You!). Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch. (I'll Shit On You!). Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family. (I'll Shit On You!). [Bizarre]. I'm a alcoholic with the fucking toilet. Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?). Bitch shut your fucking mouth. I'ma keep eating 'till Richard Simmons comes to my house. with a chain saw to cut me out. I'll fuck your wife. I had sex since I met her. I'm to busy fucking, your 12 year old baby sitter. And all women ain't shit. Only good for cooking, cleaning. and sucking dick and thats it (I said it). I was responsible for killing John Candy. I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry. I don't give a fuck who you are. I'll shit on anybody. Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre. [Eminem]. My adolescent years weren't shit 'till what I do now. I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down. The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in. The more ignorant, the incident, is I fit in. Ignoring the shit how boring it gets. When there's no one to hit. I don't know when to quit throwing a fit. I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me. Its they who raised me and say the can take me. Its they who legs I brake and make achy. Its they who mistake me and make me so angry. (I'll Shit On You!) I'll spit on you. Start pissing and do the opposite on you. You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you. Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and. Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch. on his skit on his last album. Pull my pants down and... Chorus. [Kon Artist]. Is Richard Pryor still alive?. If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying (what?). Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless. Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it. Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with. Will hang you up naked by your ankles dangling. My need I stay strangling. I don't need your help. If you gon' give me the pussy. I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll Shit On You!). I'll punch your daddy not, your mom's kinda cock. Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks. Buck fifty cross your neck. Floss your teck, I'll beat you with it across your chest. [Kuniva]. It's only right I jack your car keys and run. Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns. For fun, when I'm drunk. I'll run a truck through the weed house. Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout. Put you in chokeholds I learned last week. From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep. (Hey, hey, hey!). I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl. Thats like D-Bo fightin Peablo Bryson (I'll Shit On You). So what you hollering and yelling about. I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out. Niggas get hit with a two piece, ""Bling Bling"". With a poisonous sting. I'm such a violent thing. Chorus. [Eminem]. Once I get on two, hits of X. My disk slips and disconnects. 'Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck. But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects. (C'mon, I'll Shit On You!). Over reaction is my only reaction. Which only sets off a chain reaction. and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action. A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten. Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters. and spilling liters of blood like swimming pools. Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too {*Bullets spray*}. A lot of people say misoginistic which is true. I can't deny it matter of fact I stand by it. So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot. If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet. Boy girl dog woman man child. I'll Shit On You!. I will Shit On You I don't care who you are. I'll Shit On You. I don't give a fuck about you or your car. I'll Shit On You. Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch. I'll Shit On You. I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me. I'll Shit On You. You heard me {*Eminem laughs*}. Bitch, I'll Shit On You. D-12 will Shit On You. I'll Shit On You. Your life. Your wife. Your kids. Your car. I'll Shit On You. Your house. Your spouse. Your rings. Your things. I'll Shit On You. I'll Shit On You. I'll Shit On You. I'll Shit On You."
i'm back,"Chorus: Eminem (repeat 4x). That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back). I'm Back (I'm Back) [Slim Shady!] I'm Back. [Eminem]. I murder a rhyme one word at a time. You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine. You better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help. What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?. I'm waiting for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell. Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail. I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve. Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf. I used to, get punked and bullied on my block. 'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox. {""Mom! Mom!""} I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less. What do I think of suc-cess? It sucks, too much press I'm stressed. Too much stares two breasts, too upset. It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes). Grew up quick (no) was raised right. Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right. You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi"". Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-. -T-E, cuz Mtv was so friendly to me. Can't wait 'til Kim sees me. Now is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?. Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't working?. You hear this finger? Oh it's upside down. Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now. Chorus. [Eminem]. I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it. just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music. And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim. and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe. {*vocal scratches*} My name is Slim Shady. I been crazy way before radio didn't play me. The sensational {*vocal scratch ""Back is the incredible!""*}. With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible. It's Ken Kaniff on the, internet. Tryin to, lure your kids with him, into bed. It's a, sick world we live in these days. ""Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"". Geez, you guys are so sensitive. ""Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"". Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic. whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoking 'em. with my windows tinted, with nine limos rented. Doin lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hopping out. all high and indo scented {*inhales, exhales*}. And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me. Chorus. [Eminem]. I take seven [kids] from [Columbine], stand 'em all in line. Add an Ak-47, a revolver, a nine. a Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine. and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time. Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy. as the world was over this whole Y2k thing. And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?. Am I the only one who realizes they stink?. Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?. Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?. It's why I tend to block out when I hear things. Cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring (Ahhhh!!!). So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger. longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina. Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz. it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!. I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother. I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her. and have a son and a new brother at the same time. and just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?. Chorus. [Eminem {*vocal scratching*}]. Guess who's b-back, back. Gue-gue-guess who's back (Hi mom!). {*scratch*} Guess who's back. {*scratch*} Gue {*scratch*} guess who's back. D-12 {*scratch*} Guess who's back. Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back. Dr. Dre {*scratch*} Guess who's back. Back back {*scratch*} back. {*scratch*}. Slim Shady, 2001. I'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck"

He's already got life in jail man, what the hell is his problem?. Well to be honest the smell of this chronic, leaves make me hella demonic. They compelled me to kill this elderly man, and. I get these these panic attacks, pop a Xanax relax!. Tryna' stick my fuckin' dick inside a mannequin's. ass. Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist get gas masked. Kick ass, the first thing I put on is the mask.. Speaking of mask, man it ain't too late to have a. change of pace,. And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you facin'. Slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by. strangulation. That's bacon soufflé you makin' ain't you? But thank you Jason. There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma. Just give me one more soma, and I'll be done for it mama. Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium lawsuit. Shove in the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet. It seems like every day I get a little flakier,. The medication is makin' my hands a little shakier. Hand me that 18-month-old baby, to shake him up. It'll only take me a, second to choke his trachea. Breaking his neck in eightysome places, baby he's. Shady comes lady. He's got the razor b-blades and the. ch-ch-chain-ch-saw, baby. You b-b-blundering bumbling mu-mu-mumbling dumb. dumbs. Yea, here I come come, you here the rumbling?. Vrum-vrum?. There's something inside of that blue tub and that. drum-drum. My head and torso is someone, where'd it come from?. Who's it belong to maybe the girl with the long. blonde?. Hair who disappeared and left the cheerleader. pom-poms. Clearly there's somin' wrong, ?cos she didn't come. home. She's missin,' where is she? Somethin' fishy is goin' on!. I guess he stuck the bitch, with the pitchfork, with the long prongs. Now everybody get your dance on to my dance song,. Come on!"

No if ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he. From Infinite down to the last Relapse album hes still shittin and. Whether hes on salary, paid hourly. Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him. Whichever comes first, for better or worse. Hes married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas.

Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road. . And I just cant keep living this way. So starting today, Im breaking out of this cage. Im standing up, Imma face my demons. Im manning up, Imma hold my ground. Ive had enough, now Im so fed up. Time to put my life back together right now. . It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me. Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you. So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through. And dont even realise what you did, believe me you. I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger. I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of. My World, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead. No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise. To focus solely on handling my responsibilitys as a father. So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it. You couldnt lift a single shingle on it. Cause the way I feel, Im strong enough to go to the club. Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up. Cause Im raising the bar, I shoot for the moon. But Im too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and. I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. Well walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let you know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road"
i'm shady,"Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (Huh?). Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl (I did). Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl. Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world. (Slim Shady), so come and kill me while my name's hot. And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot (Ow). Think I've got a generation brainwashed. To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot (Uh, oh?). Stop they blood flow until they veins clot. I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch. Purple haze and acid raindrops. Spike the punch at the party and drain pop (gulp gulp). Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top. Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop. Gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you. So everybody buy my shit or I’ma come and kill you. I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets. I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free. You know me I'm your friend when you need a mintin’. (Slim Shady). I'm Shady. I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh huh huh). I like birds, bees, I like people. I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful. Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!). The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike. While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like. And this is how I am in real life. I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (Uh huh). How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat. When they're high off of drugs they haven't even done yet. So bring the money by tonight. Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife. She ever saw in her life (Help me help me). I try to keep it positive and play it cool. Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!). Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better. Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter. I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets. I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free. You know me I'm your friend when you need a mintin’. (Slim Shady). I'm Shady. I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it (Aw that shit is wack). Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit (What????). People don't buy shit no more they just dub it. That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh). But they love it when you make your business public. So fuck it, I've got herpes while we're on the subject (Uh huh). And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it. Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playing when I say it. Well, I do take pills, don't do speed. Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed. Don't do smack, I do do shrooms. Do drink beer, I just wanna make a few things clear. My baby mama's not dead (nuh uh), she's still alive and bitching (yup). And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itching. It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested. I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested. I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets. I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free. You know me I'm your friend when you need a mintin’. (Slim Shady). I'm Shady. I told you I was Shady. Y'all didn't wanna believe me. I'm Shady. And that's my name. Eminem."

The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it. before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it. My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication. but this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation? (Come on!). Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?). The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray. Running up and down the street screaming, ""Fuck the Police"". when you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth.

Dont get so bent out of shape. cause I went out and raped six girlfriends. Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me. cause they don't know better. They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up. and fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up. My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home. it hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?). Shit, talk about your brain being baked. My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades. Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby,. Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady. You critics wanna criticize but couldnt visualize. individuals lives through a criminal's eyes. The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing. and Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit. I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth. and shove his head in the fan blade. Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say. or change cause of the age range in my fan base. Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit. Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit. Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now. It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now. But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it. but as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent. either that or booed, thats why I keep an attitude. and go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon. I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge. I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old. Chorus. [Dr. Dre]. Fuck that, turn that shit off. Let's get the fuck out of here."
if i had,"Life.. by Marshall Mathers. What is life?. Life is like a big obstacle. put in front of your optical to slow you down. And everytime you think you gotten past it. it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground. What are friends?. Friends are people that you think are your friends. But they really your enemies, with secret indentities. and disguises, to hide they true colors. So just when you think you close enough to be brothers. they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin. What is money?. Money is what makes a man act funny. Money is the root of all evil. Money'll make them same friends come back around. swearing that they was always down. What is life?. I'm tired of life. I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins. I'm tired of committing so many sins. Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins. Tired of never having any ends. Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins. I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins. Tired of not having a deal. Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel. Tired of drowning in my sorrow. Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo. I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off. I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour. then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off. I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough. Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk. for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk. I'm tired of using plastic silverware. Tired of working in Building Square. Tired of not dating Alana. Tired of not being a millionaire. But if I had a million dollars. I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics. If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick. without a condom on, while I'm on the john. If I had a million bucks. it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out. robbing armored trucks. If I had one wish. I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss. I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor. Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store. I'm tired of not having a phone. Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on. Tired of not driving a BM. Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him. Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM. Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum. Tired of not being on tour. Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work. in the back of a Contour. I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones. Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns. Tired of being stared at. I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat. Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz. Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs. Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me. saying they wasn't feeling me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me"". I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs. Tired of J-L-B saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives"". But if I had a million dollars. I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics. If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick. without a condom on, while I'm on the john. If I had a million bucks. it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out. robbing armored trucks. If I had one wish. I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss. You know what I'm saying?. I'm tired of all of this bullshit. Telling me to be positive. How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?. Know what I'm sayin?. I rap about shit around me, shit I see. Know what I'm sayin? Right now I'm tired of everything. Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city. Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?. But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?. Just fed up. That's my word."

infinite,"Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass. One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313. You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this. For the 9-6. Verse 1:. Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction. To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action. A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction. You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun. My rhyming skills got you climbing hills. I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills. I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants. With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects. We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up. Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke. This is the season for noise pollution contamination. Examination of more cartoons than animation. My lamination of narration. Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation. When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing. I turn the stage into a barren wasteland.... I'm Infinite. Chorus:. You heard of hell well I was sent from it. I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments. Now I'm trying to repent from it. But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it.... I'm Infinite. Verse 2:. Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense. I got to meet the fence fruit was stompin at your feet to rinse. I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans. I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands. My coil hands around this microphone lethal. One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people. MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium. Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one. Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator. There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus. Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases. My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces. My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis. And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally. With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite. Chorus:. You heard of hell well I was sent from it. I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments. Now I'm trying to repent from it. But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it.... I'm Infinite. Verse 3:. Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since. My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O. So I'm assuming all responsibility. Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's. Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler. Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler. No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical. I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school. I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical. I'd rather led a tactful, tractical, track for your fancy. In fact I can't see, or can't imagine. A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching. This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam. Plus the man who never had a plan B. Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit. I'm tense to be tempted when I see the sins my friends commit.... I'm Infinite. Chorus:. You heard of hell well I was sent from it. I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments. Now I'm trying to repent from it. But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it.... I'm Infinite. You heard of hell well I was sent from it. I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments. Now I'm trying to repent from it.

The next day my mother said. ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!"". The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed. He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead. Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset. Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck. I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you. I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get.

Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off. Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot. Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop. Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong. Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong. That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong. Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn. And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on. Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off. everything, except his tank top and his training bra. Ain't he raw?

Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping. Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!. What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting. Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being. No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing. I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see. I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me.

We're gonna have a problem here.... {verse 1}. Ya'll act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door. Started whoopin her ass worst than before. they first were dirvorced sold her old furniture (scream). It's the return of the. ""Awww wait, no way, your kidding. He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"". And Dr Dre said.... Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead he's locked in my basement (haha). Feminist women loved Eminem. Chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him. Look at him walking around grabing his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who (yea but hes so cute though). Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms. Sometimes I wanna get on TV and let Loose,. but can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose. ""My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips. And if im lucky u might just give it a little kiss"". And that's the messege we deliver to little kids. and expect them not to know what a women's *vagina* is. Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is. by the time they hit 4th grade,. they got the discovery channel don't they?. We ain't nothing but mammals, well some of us cannibals. who *rip* other people open like canolopes. But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes. then theres no reason that a man and another man can't elope (ughh). But if you feel like I feel I got the antadoite. Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus. And it gooooesss. (Refrain). I'm Slim Shady. Yes I'm the Real Shady. All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating. So won't the real Slim Shady....

You think I give a damn about a grammy?. Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me. (but Slim what if u win wouldn't it be weird?). Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?. So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears. s--- Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs. So I can sit next to Carson Daily and Fred Durst. And hear them argue over who she gave *head* to first. Little *bitch* put me on blast on MTV. (yea hes cute but I think he's married to Kim, hehe). I should download a audio on mp3. And show the whole world how you gave Eminem *head* (scream). I'm sick of you little golden boy groups all you do is annoy me. So I been sent in here to destroy you. And there's a million of us just like me. Who cuss like me. Who just don't give a *f---* like me. Who dress like me. Walk, Talk and act like me. It just might be the next best thing. But not quite me. (Refrain). {verse 3}. I'm like a headtrip to listen to. Cause I'm only giving you. things you joke about with your friends inside your living room. The only difference is I got the balls to say it In front of ya'll. And I don't got to be false or sugar coat it at all. I just get on the mic and spit it. Wheather you like to admit it. I'm better than 90% of you rappers out there. Then you wanna outkin kids like these albums like. Its funny cuz the rate im going when I'm 30. I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting. Pinching nurses asses when I'm *hard* jerkin I'm jerking. But this whole bag of viagra isn't working. And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin. He could be workin at Burger King spitten on your onion rings. Were in the parking lot circling. screaming I don't give a *f---*. With his windows down and system up. So will the Real Shady, please stand up. and put one of those fingers on each hand up. and to be proud to out of your mind and out of control. and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?. . Ha ha. Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us. Fuck it, let's all stand up. ."

it's ok,"Eye-Kyu: Check it out,. Eminem: Hey Kyu!. Eye-Kyu:. Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok). I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright). It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep). It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here). It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok). I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright). It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep). It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here). Verse 1: Eminem. One day I plan to be a family man happily married. I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried. Till I'm glad to be buried. And leave this crazy world. And have at least a half a million for my baby girl. It may be early to be planning this stuff. Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough. Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough. I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed. My hands have been cuffed. But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff. Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts. I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough. And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see. My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased. With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese. I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call. Way before my baby is able to crawl. I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates. To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades. I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth. Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q. Eye-Kyu:. Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok). I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright). It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep). It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here). It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok). I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright). It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep). It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here). Verse 2: Eminem. I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps. Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep. Praying for sleep. Dreaming with a watering mouth. Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse. In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts. With the root of all evil. I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful. And make them do shit illegal. For these Grant's and Jackson's. These transactions explain a man's actions. But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity. Through God and there's a wish he granted me. He showed me how to cope with the stress. And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed. Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest. To selling dope with the rest. I quit smoking cess to open my chest. Life is stressful inside this cesspool. Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel. My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics. He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts. Kids attract static, children with automatics. Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets. I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum. I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum. It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth. But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth. Eye-Kyu:. Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok). I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright). It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep). It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here). It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok). I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright). It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep).

He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?. Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!. He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick. I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?. He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time. He has no career move, I mean.... Verse 1:. I come home every single day from working double shifts. And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts. I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me. Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously. Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me. It must be only just because you never learned to trust me. Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues. To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse. I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me. I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things. So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me. You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me. I used to love your company now you always bugging me. For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me. So I'ma wait for your evacuation. Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in. See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure. So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure. I recommend you take your things and check them in. Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?. Chorus: Men Singing. Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (8X). Women's Voice: (Talking over singing). Fuck you and what you going through. Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man. Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money. Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang. Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night. Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about. Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy. Verse 2:. I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments. I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense. Until the day I started following your feetprints. And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents. It made complete sense, there's someone else you like. So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?. And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga**. Someone rich that I could follow. And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow. Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted. I fell apart when you departed then the joking started. I was an open target, you play comedian. And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again. And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife. All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife. He goes, ""You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"". Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down. You run me down and now your trying to apologize. For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes. Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it. Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it.... Chorus: Men Singing. Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (12X)."

Jimmy can Crack Corn, but I don't care. My enemies Crack Corn, but I don't care. You can be black, white or albino, yeah. You can have corn rows inside your hair. I give a fuck if I don't like your stare. This bottle of wine goes upside your head. A little bit psycho, but I know that. Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it. See if you don't brag, then I don't brag. I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad. I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit. You can just keep makin' them tired old threats.

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but. I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want. If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice. If you keep comin' back, it only means you know you lost a fight. They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit. Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it. 'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit. And get doo-doo on the shoe again, as soon as they washed it. But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like 'go get 'em'. And I'm just like 'why your tryna fight momentum?'. We just keep winnin', by landslides oh and umm. Shady Limited is in any size yo' Denim. To velour, even our clothing line's on fire. As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''. Meanwhile your mind's on us, like mine's on Mariah. And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars. But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her. right in the ass with KY, yes sir!. So full of joy, why am I absurd. Even Chingy would tell you. 'Yeah boy don't curr'. Chorus. [50 Cent]. Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care. The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there. It is what it is dawg, man life's not fair. Ya friends shoulda know not to front 'round here. You see kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear. They'll strip yo' ass off your jewels, right here. Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear. Man you can catch a hot one like outta nowhere. A beautiful day, without drama is rare. Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share. Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare. You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up playa. In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor. ridin', winding, dining and shining, know what I'm sayin'?. I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplayin'.

just don't give a fuck,"Intro by Frogg. Whoah!. A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em. and like, back and forth because ah. this is... what you thought it wasn't.... It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen. I be the F-R-O the double G (coughing in background). And check out the man he goes by the name of er.... Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady. I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady.. I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer. Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer.. You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from. You ain't go' sell two copies if you press a double album.. Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open. I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then;. My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall). I have a disease and they don't know what to call it. Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash. Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass. Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin. You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson. The Proof is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton. I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman. Chorus:. So when you see me on your block with two glocks. Screamin ""Fuck the World"" like Tupac. I just don't give a fuck!!. Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin. tellin your boys that I'm on crack. I just don't give a fuck!!. So put my tape back on the rack. Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack. I just don't give a fuck!!. But see me on the street and duck. Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed. Cause I just don't give a fuck!!. I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Milkbone. I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone. I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason. I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin. Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview. I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review. I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals. This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols. But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles. Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!). Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion. Pathological liar, blowin shit outta proportion. The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic. Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict. Half animal, half man. Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can. With more holes than an Afghan. (Chorus). Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!). I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine. I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin. Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion.. Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure. I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher. I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches. Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes. In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush. Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush. Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed. Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team. Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian. Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again. I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median. Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in. (Chorus). (Outro). Hey, fuck that!. Outsidaz.... Pace One.... Young Zee...."

Now everyone report to the dance floor. Alright stop! Pajama time. Come here little kiddies, on my lap. Guess who's back with a brand new rap. And I don't mean rap. as in a new case of child molestation accusation. Aah aah aah aah aah. No worries, poppa's got a brand new bag of toys. What else could I possibly do to make noise?. I done touched on everything, but little boys. That's not a stab at Michael. That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho. I go a little bit crazy sometimes. I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes. Good God, dip, do a little slide. Bend down, touch your toes and just glide. Up the center of the dance floor. Like teepee from my bung hole in the school. if you let one go. Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it. Give a little ""poot poot"", it's ok {*Fart sound*}. Oops my cd just skipped. And everyone just heard you let one rip. CHORUS. Now I'm gonna make you dance. It's your chance. Yeah boy shake that ass. Whops I mean girl, girl girl girl. Girl you know you're my world. Alright now lose it (Aah aah aah aah aah). Just lose it (Aah aah aah aah aah). Go crazy (Aah aah aah aah aah). Oh baby (Aah aah). Oh baby baby (Aah aah). It's Friday and it's my day. Used to party all the way to Sunday. Maybe till Monday, I don't know what day. Everyday's just a holiday. Crusin' on the freeway. Feelin' kinda breezy. Get the top down, let my hair blow. I don't know where I'm goin'. All I know is when I get there. someone's gonna ""touch my body"". Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk. But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work. Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair. Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out. (Eww). Now what's your name girl?. What's your sign?. [Dr. Dre] Man, you must be up out your mind. [Eminem] Dre (aah aah). Beer goggles blind. I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm. Chorus. Now I'm gonna make you dance. It's your chance. Yeah boy shake that ass. Whops I mean girl, girl girl girl.

All I know is this much. I'm not guilty. They said save it 'fore we catch you on tape. Now an old lady, touch my body. Now this is the part where the rap breaks down. It's really intense, no one makes a sound. Everything looks like it's ""8 Mile"" now. The beat comes back and everybody lose yourself and. snap back to reality look it's B Rabbit. And you signed me up to battle?. I'm a grown man. Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba. I don't have any lines to go right here so. Chuba chuba chuba fellas what? fellas what?. Grab you left nut, make right one jealous what?. Black girls, white girls, skinny girls. fat girls, tall girls, small girls. I'm calling all girls. Everyone report to the dance floor. It's your chance for a little romentor. Butt squeezin' it's the season. Just go... (aah aah aah aah). It's so appealing. Chorus. Now I'm gonna make you dance. It's your chance. Yeah boy shake that ass. Whops I mean girl, girl girl girl. Girl you know you're my world. Alright now lose it (Aah aah aah aah aah). Just lose it (Aah aah aah aah aah).

Wedgie in my underwear. the whole bed sheet and the comforter. Stuck up in my rectal crack. kiss my disrespectful ass. I'll ride through your cul-de-sac. Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks. You collaborative effort rap. I have never said his raps. Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap. And ruined your welcome mat. So spit that shit from the heart. you didn't write like you wrote it. While I teabag the microphone. 'cause I go nuts on it. Like a fighter jet lined with explosives. that'll strike any moment. Headed right at opponents. and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it. I'm 'bout to—. Smash into everyone, crash into everything. Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017. Fack, fack on everyone.

Fack, fack on everyone. Fack, fack on everyone. I'm a Kamikaze, gonna. I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough. when I wasn't (wasn't). From the moment I heard rap was cussin'. I was in (was in). Which is why I identify with the guy. Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein. Energized like a nine volt, ice cold. Like Snake Eyes. twice in a row on a dice roll. But if the only reason I blowed. is 'cause I'm white though. Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh). Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note. Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me. 'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes. 'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone.

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45. that shit was embarrassing. There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee. That way that shit was so ass. it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air. The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare. In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher. Each nut is the chair width of an acorn. stairlift beware of me. Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared. Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is. Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'. Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist. But somethin' here is afoot—oh yeah, it's my dick. Get the measurin' stick (what?) , twelve inches of wood. Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular. since Craig G ""Duck Alert"". And I've come to pay respects. 'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words. You get laid to rest. And I hope your butt is hurt. Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book. You got some views, but you're still below me. Mine are higher. so when you compare our views, you get overlooked. And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook. And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth. And you know I've always spoke the truth. You lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth. And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do. When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you. And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do. Line up the rappers. Take my pic like a photo shoot"

Pope John Paul the second, brain like satan. Have your beaten girlfriend cooking up bacon. I'm obituite with that shit that you hit. Slow my flick with ya cause mine to pick wit her. Eminem:. My nine is limpin ya six deep when i spray rounds. Hit you with 12 shots in mid air and four more on the way down. The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground. You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!). No pun intended, snapped out of your whip. And leave it un-attended before i whip out this gun and hit it. Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute. Cause i can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it. Snap the airbag, hit the corner and park it.

I'm e-mailing you, at the wrong website. Mispelling you, break you and put the fear of hell in you. Escape above you, stuff the nurse in a purse. Disperse like i added too many words in a verse. Slim Shady, a perverted virgin at birth {or ""version of birth""}. Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church. The first person searching the earth for the motherfucker. That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first. You don't curse and hit with your own words. Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves. And if i don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up. Then i'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up (fuck y'all!). Mr. Eon:. If y'all got a bowl of hash better cash it.

Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!. I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em. I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid.

Whatever, I hate these things. Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks. Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows. just to argue with 'em cuz their ratings stink?. Fuck That!

I'm perplexed. Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next. Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack. Was watchin' 8 Mile on my Nordictrack. Realized I forgot to call you back. Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap. Stan, Stan, son. Listen, man, Dad isn't mad. But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun. And have a man-bun?. The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable. Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked. Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me. I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze.

Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort. But if I was three-foot-eleven. You'd look up to me, and for the record. You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second. Lick a ballsack to get on my channel. Give your life to be as solidified. This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets. So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?. Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper. How the fuck can him and I battle?. He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel. I'll give him my sandals. 'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow. Exhausting, letting off on my offspring. Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!. You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see. You're fuckin' salty. 'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey. Your red sweater, your black leather. You dress better, I rap better. That a death threat or a love letter?. Little white toothpick. Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick. Thanks for dissing me. Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike"".

That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!. I'm sick of you bein' wack. And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune. So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it). I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth. Need to get the cock up out it. Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it). I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings. Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think. That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers). Don't mean you are, and you're not about it.

Fuck you!. You did this to us. you did it, it's your fault.. Oh my god, I'm crackin up, get a grip, Marshall!. Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party?. And you were, like, so drunk. that you threw up all over Archie?. That was funny, wasn't it?. [Kim: Yes!]. That was funny, wasn't it?. [Kim: Yes!]. See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?. You and your husband had a fight. One of you tries to grab a knife,. And during the struggle, he accidentally. Gets his Adam's apple sliced. And while this is goin' on. his son just woke up,. and he just walks in. She panics. And he gets his throat cut, so.

kings never die (feat. gwen stefani),"[Gwen Stefani]. Here to stay. Even when I'm gone. When I close my eyes. Through the passage of time. Kings never die. [Eminem]. I can hear the drummers drumming. And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone. I know something's coming. But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit. And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was. Was it, too good to be true?. Have nothing, get it all but too much of it. Then lose it again, then I swallow hallucinogens. Cause if not, where the hell did it go?. Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven. Just choosing to sin. Even if it means I'm selling my soul. Just to be the undisputed again. Do whatever I gotta do just to win. Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head. Crown around it, thorns on it. Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't. Think I'd be back, did ya?. How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog. But no matter how loud that I bark. This sport is something I never bow-wow'd at. I complain about the game, I shout and I pout. It's a love-hate. But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt. Even when you bitches are counting me out. And I appear to be down for the count. Only time I ever been out. And about is driving around town. With my fucking whereabouts, in a doubt cause. I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here. But I'm not a quitter. Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up. Spit or shit or stepped on but kept going. I'm tryna be headstrong. But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong. Cause you're moving onto the next. But is the respect gone?. Cause someone told me that. (Kings never die). Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir. You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep. Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer. Wouldn't even take shit into consideration. Obliterate anyone in the way. I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features. And try to show out on a track with me. But it'd actually have to be a fucking blowout. To get me to retire. Tell these new artists that kings never die. I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page. Did just say I've been upstaged?. Why am I online? It's driving me crazy. I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge. Almost hot, but I'm not running kaboom. With a stage pass and this shit. And opinions sway, I can hear them say. If I stay passionate. Maybe I can stay Jay miraculous. Comeback as if I went away. But detractors just say some bullshit for the Renegade. Someone's gonna make me blow my composure. Here I go again, to the stage. And I feel like I'm in a cage. They so want a champion to fall. I still wonder why I laugh at 'em. Cause why carry when I'm all. So fuck what these cynics say. Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall. And I'm under attack again, I'll act as if I'm posed ta. With this pent up rage. Cause all these plaques in my office. On the floor stacked against the door. Are they just metaphors for the odds of. Me comin' back again. Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards. And trophies just don't mean jack anymore. Cause I'm here today and gone tomorrow. And I'm not gonna be. Here to stay. Even when I'm gone. When I close my eyes. Through the passage of time. Kings never die. I want it, I'm coming to get it. So you son of a bitches don't duck. You're gonna get riddick bowed. Critics'll end up in critical. Think your shit is dope. All you're gonna get is smoked then. And I'm not stopping until I'm top again. All alone and on a throne. Like a token of respect, or a homage poem. Or an ode, I've been on. Tossed in the air by my own arm. And launched so hard I broke my collarbone. And when it's my time to go, but I'm still not leaving. Stop for no one, I don't know. But I've been told an obstacle that. Blocks your road, knock it over. Time to go for that pot of gold, cause. They say kings never die. Just ask Jam Master Jay. They just grow wings and they fly. So, hands up, reach for the sky. Try to hold up and prolong these moments. Cause in a blink of an eye. They'll be over. Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur. And ensure that nobody's ever gonna be what you were. So before you're leaving this Earth. You want people to feel the fury. Of a pure evil cerebral berzerk. Deacon of words, syllable genius at work. Plus I'm think that they're mistaking my kindness. For weakness, distill it with meanness. I went from powdered milk and Farina. To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts. From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas. Still appeal to the dreamers. I made it to the silverscreen. But Rocky's still what the theme is. Khalil on the beat cause making the beat. Ain't the same feeling to me as killing the beat is. Or fulfilling to me, what filling a seat is. It's that ""Sound Bombing"" Thirstin' Howl. Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz. Stomach growl, throbbing hunger. Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot. I swear that I won't let you down. I'mma be around forever and a day. Even in the ground. You ain't ever gonna hear me say I ain't. Here to stay. Even when I'm gone. When I close my eyes. Through the passage of time. Kings never die. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Kings never die"

legacy,"Hook. Tell me where to go, tell me what to do. I'll be right there for you. Tell me what to say, don't matter if it's true. I'll say it all for you. [Verse 1: Eminem]. I used to be the type of kid. would always think the sky is falling. Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?. What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in. Because I belong in this world. That's why scoffering authority, defined often. Flying off [...] to handle it with mom, no dad. So I'm non complying at home, at school. I'm just shy and awkward. And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist. Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems. Thinking he can try and solve them. I'm outside chalking up joints on the sidewalk. And in the front drive talking to myself. Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet. Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing. I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking. Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker. Because he said I eyeballed him. [Bridge]. And if you fall, ill get you there. I'll be your savior from all the words. that are inside your world. Please have faith in my words. Because... this is my legacy, legacy, ehh. There's no guarantee, it's not up to me looking. This is my legacy, legacy. I used to be the type of kid would always think. the sky is falling. Why am I so differently wired Am I. [Verse 2: Eminem]. I used to be the type of kid would always think. the sky is falling. Why am I so differently wired? Am I a Nogging?. Cuz' sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling. Cuz I obsess on everything and my mind it's small shit. Bothers me but now my father he said cyanoira. and split but I don't give a shit. I'm fine along. as theirs batteries in my Walkman. nothing is the matter with me. Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking. I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment. complex on a ten speed which. I've acquired parts I found in the garbage. a frame and put tires on it, headphones. on straight ahead and gives a *** shit, but if this. Try and put up a fight's nonsense, but i think. What about those rhymes I've been jottin'. Instead of tryina escape through my comics, why don't I. To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that. Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him. Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch. Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on. I could be iconic, and my conquest is worth to fight"
lighters (ft. bruno mars),"[Bruno Mars:]. This one's for you and me, living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters. [Eminem:]. By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up. I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up. If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening. Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward uh. Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king?. This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking. Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me. I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music. There is or there ever will be, disagree. Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up. The only thing I ever gave's using no more excuses. Excuse me if my head is too big for this building. And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick. Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit. Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite. You stayed the same, just cock back with this still cock you pricks. I love it when I tell em shove it. Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall said bust a leg. Muster cause he couldn't cut mustard mustered up nothing. Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz. Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it. Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head. Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?. Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off. Little hussy ass, cause f-ck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it. What difference it make?. What it take to get it through your thick skulls. As if this ain't some bullshit. People don't usually come back this way. From a place that was dark as I was in. Just to get to this place. Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage. And let it be known from this day forward. I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me strength. So let em cause I came with 5'9' but I feel like I'm 6'8'. [Bruno Mars:]. This one's for you and me, living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters. [Royce Da 5'9"":]. By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie. I advance like going from toting iron to going. From buying 4 or 5 of the homies to iron man outtie. My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin to blow it. And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute. To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic. Tell him how real he is or high I am. Or how I would kill for him for him to know it. I cried many tears, my daddy got a bad back. So it's only right that I right till he can march. Right into that post office and tell em to hang it up. Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years. I'll stop when I'm at the very top. You shitted on me on your way up. It's bout to be a scary drop. Cause what goes up must come down. You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box. Every hour, happy hour now. Life is wacky now. Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy. Now I'm just the cats meooww, ow. Classic cow, always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao. Ya'll are doomed. I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me. My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes. Cause now I'm in the Aston. I went from having my city locked up. To getting treated like ? Patrick. And now I'm fantastic. Compared to a weed high. And y'all niggas just gossiping like bitches on a radio and TV. See me, we fly. Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive. And how real is that. I remember signing my first deal and now. I'm the second best I can deal with that. Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag. [Bruno Mars:]. You and I know what it's like. To be kept down, forced to fight. But tonight we're alright. So hold up your light. Let it shine. Cause this one's for you and me. Living out our dreams. We are right where we should be. With my arms out wide I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters"
like home (feat. alicia keys),"Yeah. Shout to everybody. Who's been on this trip with me. You don't have to agree. But if you feel like me. Someone get this aryan a sheet. Time to bury him,. so tell him to prepare to get impeached. Everybody on your feet. This is where terrorism and. heroism meets, square up in the streets. This chump barely even sleeps. All he does is watch. Fox News like a parrot and repeats. While he looks like a canary with a beak. Why you think banned. transgenders from the military with a tweet?. He's trying to divide us,. this shit's like a cult. But like Johnny, he'll only unite us. 'Cuz nothing drives us inside. like this fight does. Similar to when two cars collide. 'cause our spirits are crushed. This spot's a tight one. But here the jaws of life. come to pull us from the wreckage. That's what we get pride from. When we can't wear stars and stripes. 'cause this type of pickle. we're in is hard to deal. But there's always tomorrow still. If we start from the scratch. like a scab for scars to heal. And band together for Charolettesville. And for Heather fallen heroes. Fill his wall with murals, Nevada get up. Hit the damn resetter, let's start from zero. This is our renewal, spray tan get ride of. Get a brand new, better, America. And here's to where we're from. This is where it all began, all began. (stand up). Here's to the land that made me. And made me who I am, who I am. (hands up). Here's to the land that raised me. There's home for the only place. that really knows me. From the cracks in the road that drove me. There's no place like home. Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?. Can't denounce the klan,. 'cause they play golf with ya. You stay on Twitter,. way to get your hate off, Nazi. I do not see a way y'all differ. And all you got a race card. biggot, the swastika. with your name carved in it. Should be your trademark,. cause it's all you played off. And you just took the plate off,. so I guess it pays. to feed off of chaos. So basically, you Adolf Hitler. But you ain't ruining our country, punk. You won't take our pride from us. You won't define us. 'Cause like a dictionary,. things are looking up. So much, got a sprained neck. Know we would rise up. Against this train wreck. and take a stand. Even if it mean sitting. when they raise the flag. This ain't the Star Spangled Banner. This man just praised. a statue of General Lee, 'cause. He generally hates the black people,. degrades hispanics. Take it back to the Shady national convention. Wish I would have spit on it. before I went to shake his hand at the event. Or maybe had the wherewithal. To know that he was gonna. try to tear apart a sacred land. We cherish and stand for, so. Hands in the air, let's hear it for. The start of a brand new America. Without him, and be proud of where we're from. And here's to where we're from. This is where it all began,. all began (stand up). Here's to the land that made me. And made me who I am, who I am (hands up). Here's to the land that raised me. There's home for the only place that really knows me. From the cracks in the road that drove me. There's no place like home. I won't give up. I won't give up on my home,. that so many died for. You already know that I won't give up. I won't give up on my home,. that so many died for. You already know there's no place like home,. no place like home. Wherever I go,. no place like home. No place like home,. no place like home. Wherever I go. This is where it all began, all began. (stand up). Here's to the land that made me. And made me who I am, who I am (hands up). Here's to the land that raised me. There's home for the only place that really knows me.

like toy soldiers,"Step by step, heart to heart,. left right left. We all fall down. Chorus. Step by step, heart to heart,. left right left. We all fall to down, like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on, for toy soldiers. I'm suppose to be the soldier. who never blows his composure. Even though I hold the weight. of the whole world on my shoulders. I ain't never suppose to show it,. my crew ain't suppose to know it. But if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino,. it don't matter I'd never drag 'em in battles. that I can handle 'less I absolutely have to. I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader. My crew looks for me to guide 'em. If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em. Now Ja said I tried to squash it,. it was too late to stop it. There's a certain line you just don't cross. and he crossed it. I heard him say Hailie's name on a song. and I just lost it. It was crazy, this shit be way. beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit. And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it. I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted. And I'm so caught in it. I almost feel I'm the one who caused it. This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it. That was never my object for someone to get killed. Why would I wanna destroy something I help build. It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good. I went through my whole career. without ever mentionin' [Suge]. Now it's just out of respect, for not runnin' my mouth. And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about. Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef. So I did, I just fell back,. watched and gritted my teeth. While he's all over Tv,. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life. Like ""fuck it I understand"" this is business. And this shit just isn't none of my business. But still knowin' this shit could pop off. at any minute 'cause.... Chorus. Step by step, heart to heart,. left right left. We all fall down, like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on, for toy soldiers. There used to be a time when,. you could just say a rhyme. And wouldn't have to worry about. one of your people dyin'. But now it's elevated 'cause. once you put someone's kids in it. The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?. It's a different ball game callin' names. and you ain't just rappin'. We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'. Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it. and had a chat with him. And asked him not to start it. he wasn't gonna go after him. Until Ja started yappin' in magazines. how we stabbed him. Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it. Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions. Some receptionist at The Source. who answers phones at his desk. has an erection for me. and thinks that I'll be his resurrection. Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record. But now he's fucked the game up. 'cause one of the ways I came up. Was through that publication. the same one that made me famous. Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'. Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too,. fuck him then. But I'm so busy being pissed off. I don't stop to think. That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.. And he's inherited mine which is fine. ain't like either of us mind. We still have soldiers that's on the front line. That's willing to die for us,. as soon as we give the orders. Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us. We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus. To show them we love 'em back. and let 'em know how important it is. to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners. Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is. But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered,. it ain't worth it. I can't think of a perfecter way to word it. Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict. I'll walk away from it all. 'fore I let it go any further. But don't get it twisted,. it's not a plea that I'm coppin'. I'm just willin' to be the bigger man. If y'all can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'. 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'. I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin. rest on my conscience 'cause.... Chorus. Step by step, heart to heart,. left right left. We all fall down, like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on, for toy soldiers"

I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next. so I dont stay in debt. me broke. you might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby. with AK's with baby bayonet's. I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying. thats why its either kill or be killed. so call me suicide homocide Ryan. [Eminem]. Theres a bomb inside my head. I'ma live wire, I am on the edge. teetering on it like I tore the iron mike. get on a nut like a tyre iron.

lose yourself,"Look, if you had one shot. Or one opportunity. To seize everything you ever wanted. One moment. Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo. His palms are sweaty. Knees weak, arms are heavy. There's vomit on his sweater already. Mom's spaghetti, he's nervous. But on the surface he looks calm. And ready to drop bombs. But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down. The whole crowd goes so loud. He opens his mouth but the words won't come out. He's choking, how?. Everybody's jokin' now. The clock's run out, time's up, over Blow!. Snap back to reality. Oh there goes gravity. Oh there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad. But he won't, give up that easy, no. He won't have it. He knows his whole back's to these ropes. It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that. But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows. When he goes back to this mobile home. That's when it's back to the lab again, yo. This whole rhapsody. He better go capture this moment. And hope it don't pass him. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better. Soul's escapin'. Through this hole that is gaping. This world is mine for the taking. Make me king. As we move toward a new world order. A normal life is boring. But superstardom's close to post mortem. It only grows harder. Homie grows hotter. He blows us all over. These hoes is all on him. Coast to coast shows. He's known as the Globetrotter. Lonely roads. God only knows. He's grown farther from home, he's no father. He goes home and barely knows his own daughter. But hold ya nose. 'Cause here goes the cold water. These hoes don't want him no mo'. He's cold product. And they moved on to the next schmoe who flows. And he knows dove and sold nada. And so the soap opera is told and unfolds. I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on. Da da dum da dum da da. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go, oh. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go, oh. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better. No more games. I'ma change what you call rage. Tear this muthafuckin' roof off. Like two dogs caged. I was playin' in the beginnin'. The mood all changed. I've been chewed up and spit out. And booed off stage. But I kept rhymin'. And stepwritin' the next cipher. Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper. All the pain inside amplified by the. Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five. And I can't provide the right type of. Life for my family 'cause man. These Goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers. And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer. This is my life and these times are so hard. And it's gettin' even harder. Tryin' to feed and water my seed. Plus teeter-totter. Caught up between bein' a father and a primadonna. Baby momma drama, screamin' on her. Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot. Another day of monotony. Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail. I've got to formulate a plot. 'Fore end up in jail or shot. Success is my only muthafuckin' option. Failure's not. Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go. I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot. So here I go, it's my shot. Feet fail me not. 'Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got. You better. Lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go, oh. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment that you own it. you better never let it go, oh. You only get one shot. Do not miss your chance to blow. 'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better. You can do anything if you set your mind to man"
lose yourself (demo original version),"Yo, if you could just, for one minute. Or one split second in time, forget everything. Everything that bothers you, or your problems. Everything, and follow me. If I was frozen inside of a moment. If I could capture time inside a capsule. An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand. It passes through it. If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it. Then I can trap it. So no more time elapses through it. If raps could do it. Maybe I could tap into it. Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks. To transmit through 'em. To make you put your ass into it. And that's when you hit the roof. Because you can't sit through it. Your passions too much for you to not to be dancing to it. And as you do it. Your movements become fast and fluent. You're mashin' to it, moshing. Until you're black and bluish. And shit you're acting foolish. This music it has influenced you to be rowdy. But in an orderly fashion. True it's chaotic. But it's got your body moving as a unit. Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just. Lose yourself in this music. This moment we own it. We won't never let it go (go). You better move yourself. Because tomorrow's ass can wait. There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate. You better lose yourself in this music. This moment we own it. We won't never let it go (go). You better move yourself. Because tomorrow's ass can wait. There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate. You better. Cause when we descend together. We begin to move as one. In perfect unison just like the moon and sun. Illuminate the room. And humans soon become aluminum. Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun. But if you close loose it once. I mean if you could let shit go. Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow. To rest your soul. You could leave the rest to me. If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy. To make 'em feel the feeling. I'm feeling right this minute. Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished. So close the shades. Makin' sure no light gets in it. The skies the limit tonight because the night's infinite. A high percentage. Of black people and white mixed in it. But no one really gives a fuck. Because they just like what's spinnin'. His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'. Like life's beginning. So come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it. Lose yourself in this music. This moment we own it. We won't never let it go (go). You better move yourself. Because tomorrow's ass can wait. There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate. You better lose yourself in this music. This moment we own it. We won't never let it go (go). You better move yourself. Because tomorrow's ass can wait. There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate. You better"

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl. i never meant to bring you to my world and now your sitting in the corner cyring. And now its my fault my fault. I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave. And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved. A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up. with first aid tape and raped on the first date. Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin. who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?). Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!). I said, Wait, first try this hallucinogen. It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin. C'mere, let's go in here. Who's in the den?"". ""It's me and Kelly!"". My bad, (sorry) let's try another room. ""I don't trust you!"". Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom. This'll help you get in touch with your roots. We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods. ""Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so drab"". Oh dag!!. ""What?"". I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!. ""Huh?!"". Chorus (x2). Yo Sue!. ""Get away from me, I don't know you"". Oh shoot, she's tripping... ""I need to go puke!!"". I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major. I just wanted to make you appreciate nature. Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya. The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you. So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?. That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out. She said,. ""Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!"". I said, I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t-shirt! (Let go!). Would you calm down you're startin to scare me. She said,. ""I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married. I don't even have any kids and I can't cook!"". (Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!. We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late. Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate. chorus (x2). Susan (wait!) Where you goin? You better be careful. ""Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled"". I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue. Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb. I'll be right back just chill baby please?. I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these. John, where's Dave at before I bash you?. ""He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!"". Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance. There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants. choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left. of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?. ""Well it depends on how many you had"". I took three, she ate the other twenty-two caps. Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, drinkin Lysol. ""She's gonna die dude"". I know and it's my fault!. ""My god!!!"". chorus (x2). My God, I'm so sorry!. I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!. Please! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!. You're not dead!! You're NOT dead!. I know you're not dead! Oh my God!. Susan wake up! Oh God...."
love game (feat. kendrick lamar),"[verse 1: eminem]. Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what. It's either lust or a cloud of dust. Judgement is clouded. Must just be the powder from the power of love. But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of. Left my girl in the house alone. Is that my soon to be spouse's moan. And the further I walked allowed her. I paused for a minute to make something, that's what I heard. Cuz after all this is her place. So I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Think I might be about busta busta. The thought's so scary, yo that it hurts, brace. Hope it ain't, there we go, yo. Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario. Though, in the first place. But you confirmed my low end theory, though. Should've known when I made it all the way to third base. And that was only the first date. Coulda made it to home plate. But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first. No, you don't, under, stand, I, don't, do this for. Anyone, ever, yeah that ain't what they all say. I'll say it, you can suck a softball through a straw. Used to be my fiance. 'til you sucked on wayne, andre, and kanye. Lebron, akon, jay, lil jon, raekwon, ma$e. Polow tha don, drake, dante ross, james conway, kwame. Guess I'm gettin my goddamn jigga on. Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'. But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all crack. But I'll probably always keep playin' the game of. [bridge: sample]. Love, love, love, love. L-l, l-l-l-love. [chrous: kendrick lamar]. She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more. She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more. I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door. She screamed she loves me like she never did before. [and I told her go where you want. And go do what you want to do. I don't care] x2. [verse 2: kendrick lamar]. I told that bitch. I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick. Suckin' dick in your momma's tub 'til your granny walked in. Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned. Like abortion, they booked you for manslaughter. You beat the case and I called you. ""sherane is not available but leave a message at the tone. And kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those. Expensive heels, you fuckin' little ferris wheel. Fuckin' spendin' on me, fuck you. Think we gon' get married still?. Fuckin' mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale. Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel. Like you should fuckin' beat it and fuckin' eat it. While I'm on my period. Now have a blessed day"". Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror. With this look on my face, curious. Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a caesarean. You know I want you bad as a benjamin, I'm delirious. I want you bad. As the head shattered on george zimmerman. After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him. His mouthpiece for a cadillac emblem. That's analogy and metaphor for yah. I should win a medal for all the ways I adore yah. This is me talkin' poetry, yeah I got some home trainin'. That ain't what you like, ain't it? what about if I was famous. As marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool. Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle, singin'. I hope she's good enough, meanwhile you're chasin' her. Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her. Pity the fool that pity the fool in me, I'mma live with the. [bridge: sample]. [hook: kendrick lamar]. [verse 3: eminem]. So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed. Snatched my housekey off my keychain. She jumped off, wee-bay from the wire, escape. Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater. Here goes that broken record, cliche, it's all my fault anyway. She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break. Treats my face like seratos, she cuts and scratches like a dj. Each day is an instant replay. They sayin' we display cinethematic abatic behavior. Back together but forgot today was her b-day. Cut me off on the freeway. Simple misunderstandin'. But just as I went to slam on the brakes. Then I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait. Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline. Stepped on them fuckers 8 times. Still goin' 73, thank god there's an exit coming up. But them other f-u-c-k's all would of hit the off ramp. So I coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin' tree. Now here she comes at full speed. She's racin' at me, okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?. Snatch the bitch out her car through the window. She screamin'. I bodyslam her onto the cement. Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole. Bury this stink ho in it, then payed. To have the street re-paved. Fuck, woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat. Like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave. Guess I eventually caved though. Cause she's layin' next to me in bed. Directly aimin' a gat at my head. Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it. I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab. I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy. Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage. Or I'm just too dramatic. Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic. I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!. Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex. I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event. I said ""hit the road"" and after she left. I sent I sent a barrage of texts. I said ""be careful driving, don't read this. And have a accident"". She glanced to look at it and write right, too bad. Thought we had a connect. No sense dwelling makes. Never been a more compelling case. Than a model covered in l'oreal and mace. Who fell from grace. Eleven stories for story telling. But the whore was yelling ""rape"". So the vocal cords were swelling and her voice. Were more hoarser than tori spelling's face. Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes. To greet norman bates with a warm embrace. Unless you're andrea yates. Don't ask me for a date, don't be late. Well the sentiments great. But wait then there's been a mistake. You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate. I have infinite hate in my blood. It's mainly because of the game of. (*message sound*). Wait dinner at eight. I have infinite hate in my blood. It's mainly because of the game of. [outro].

love the way you lie (feat. rihanna),"(Rihanna). Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. That's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. That's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). I can't tell you what it really is. I can only tell you what it feels like. And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe. I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight. As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in. flight. I offer love drunk from my hate. It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I. suffer. I suffocate. And right before I'm about to drown she. resuscitates me. She fucking hates me and I love it. Wait. Where you going. I'm leaving you. No you ain't. Come back. We're running right back. Here we go again it's so insane. Cause when it's going good it's going great. I'm Superman with the wind in his back. She's Lois Lane. But when it's bad it's awful. I feel so ashamed. I snap. Who's that dude?. I don't even know his name. I laid hands on him. I'll never stoop so low again. I guess I don't know my own strength. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. That's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). You ever love somebody so much. You can barely breathe. When you're with them. You meet. And neither one of you. Even know what hit them. Got that warm fuzzy feeling. Yeah them chills. Used to get them. Now you're getting fucking sick. Of looking at them. You swore you've never hit them. Never do nothing to hurt them. Now you're in each other's face. Spewing venom. And these words. When you spit them. You push. Pull each other's hair. Scratch, claw, pit them. Throw them down. Pin them. So lost in the moments. When you're in them. It's the craze that the corporate. Controls you both. So they say it's best. To go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know you. Cause today. That was yesterday. Yesterday is over. It's a different day. Sound like broken records. Playing over. But you promised her. Next time you'll show restraint. You don't get another chance. Life is no Nintendo game. But you lied again. Now you get to watch her leave. Out the window. Guess that's why they call it windowpane. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. That's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. (Eminem). Now I know we said things. Did things. That we didn't mean. And we fall back. Into the same patterns. Same routine. But your temper's just as bad. As mine is. You're the same as me. But when it comes to love. You're just as blinded. Baby please come back. It wasn't you. Baby it was me. Maybe our relationship. Isn't as crazy as it seems. Maybe that's what happens. When a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is. I love you too much. To walk away now. Come inside. Pick up your bags off the sidewalk. Don't you hear sincerity. In my voice when I talk. Told you this is my fault. Look me in the eyeball. Next time I'm pissed. I'll aim my fist. At the dry wall. Next time. There will be no next time. I apologize. Even though I know it's lies. I'm tired of the games. I just want her back. I know I'm a liar. If she ever tries to fucking leave again. I'mma tie her to the bed. And set this house on fire. Just gonna. (Rihanna). Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. That's alright because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. that's alright because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie"
love the way you lie (part. 2),"On the first page of our story. The future seemed so bright. Then this thing turned out so evil. I don't know why I'm still surprised. Even angels have their wicked schemes. And you take that to new extremes. But you'll always be my hero. Even though you've lost your mind. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's all right because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's all right because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. Now there's gravel in our voices. Glass is shattered from the fight. In this tug of war, you'll always win. Even when I'm right. ‘Cause you feed me fables from your hand. With violent words and empty threats. And it's sick that all these battles. Are what keeps me satisfied. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's all right because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's all right because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. So maybe I'm a masochist. I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave. Til the walls are goin' up. In smoke with all our memories. [Eminem]. This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face. Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction. Hush baby, speak softly, tell me I'll be sorry. That you pushed me into the coffee table last night. So I can push you off me. Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me. Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy. Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me. Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me. Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the. Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we. Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs. That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky. Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,. You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?. I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count. But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain. Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'. This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand. Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it. With you I'm in my f-ckin' mind, without you, I'm out it. [Chorus]. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's all right because I like the way it hurts. Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. But that's all right because I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie. Ohhh, I love the way you lie. I love the way you lie"
love you more,"[Intro]. You still love me?. Take this [2 guns cock]. You ready? 1..2..3! [2 shots]. [Chorus]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Cuz you love me and I love you more. [Verse 1]. It's sick,but who could ever predict. We'd be doin' the same shit. We say we do it for our baby but we don't. We do it for us,it's lust. Cuz neither one of us trust each other. So we fuck 'til we bust. Then we cuss each other,out. We know what it's about. Shout 'til I throw you out the house. You throw me out the house. I throw you on the couch. Punch you in the mouth. Fist fight 'til we turn this mother-out!. And apologize after. Laughter,pain,it's insane. We're back in the same chapter again. And it's sad but it's true. When I'm layin' here with you. There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do. Because. [Chorus]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more it turns me on. Cuz you love me and I love you more. [Verse 2]. Cuz I hate you,do you hate me?. Good cuz you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry. It makes me wanna just take you. And just throw you on the bed. And fuck you like I don't even know you. You Fuck other and I Fuck other people. You a Slut but I'm equal, I'm a Mutt. We're both evil in our ways. But neither one of us would ever admit it. Cuz one of us would have one up on the other. So forget it. We can make accusations. People spread rumors. But they ain't got proof. 'Til they do it's just the two of us. It's you and me,. cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me. But you gotta believe me to a degree. Cuz if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it. Yeah I would cuz the sex is too damn good. If I ran who would I run to. That would be this soft and warm. So it's off and on, usually more off than on. But at least we know. That we share this common bond. You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on. I hope, the only reason that I cope. Is cuz of that fact. And plus I can bust in that. And that's why.... [Chorus]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Cuz you love me and I love you more. [Verse 3]. I could never understand it. That's why I don't try. From junior high until we both die. It's silly oh, why must we try. Is it really so rough. That we must always call each others billy goat's gruff. Try to pull each others legs. Until the other begs. We're lying to ourselves. That's the beauty of it yeah. Cuz we truly love each other. That's why we always fight. And all we do is shove each other. Every other fuckin' night. And it's clear it ain't gonna change. It's pent up rage. We both have. We both feel like we've been upstaged. By someone else. We've both been. Someone else's someone else. Problem is neither one wants help. It's an addiction and it can't be fixed. Our family's mixed up. There's a baby sister in the mix. And it hurts cuz the pieces to the. Puzzle don't fit. And anybody who thinks they know us. doens't know shit. And they're probably just tired of hearin' it. all the time. On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme. All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop. What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo. But I won't be made a fool of. If this is true love. You wouldn't do what. You did last time. You wouldn't screw up. This time. Cuz this time girl. I'm tellin' you what. You do it again I'm fuckin' you up. No matter what.... [Bridge]. What you say, what you do. I'ma hunt you down til' I find you. No matter where you run, I'll be right there. Right behind you, in your nightmares. All the flowers and the candy. All the times that you threw it back at me. You say you hate me, you gon' hate me more. When you find out you can't escape me whore. [Chorus]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Cuz you love me and I love you more"
"low, down, dirty","Warning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted. You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted. Doctor slapped my momma, ""Bitch you got a sick kid"". Arrested, molested myself and got convicted. Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises. Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis. I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful. Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo. ""Murder Murder Redrum"". Brain size of a bread crumb. Which drug will I end up dead from. Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated. ""How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related?"". Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter. Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder. Jumped out (Ahhhh!) killed the bitch and did her. Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er. Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler. Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler. Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler. Didn't Ya? Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her. Chorus: Eminem + (Redman Sample) - 2X. [E] I'm low down and I'm shiftee!. ""And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him. and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from.."". I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons. With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds. Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits. Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits. Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it. I'ma let your grandpa hit it. Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it. Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum. But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum. So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage. Losing all of my leverage. Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich. Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage. Smoked out like Eckridge. Band just making my neck itch. What the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch. You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast. Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips. Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips. Slap hips, support domestic violence. Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence. I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?. If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in. Chorus. My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling. Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England. I'm out the game, put the second string in. This Brandy got my swinging. Bobbing back and forth like a penguin. Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English. Make your mama be like ""Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?"". ""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it. It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit."". It was predicted by a medic. I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic. Living off liquid Triametic. Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing. Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin. Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue. I think I'm dying, God is that you?. Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP. Take me to ER ASAP for and IV. Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop. They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac. It's politics, it's all a fix. Setup by these white blue collared hicks. Just to make a dollar off of black music. With a subliminal ball of tricks. But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks. Chorus."
lucky you (feat. joyner lucas),"Woah. Joyner, Joyner. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I done did a lot of things in my day. I admit it, I don't take back what I say. If I said it, then I meant it. All my life I want a Grammy. But I'll prolly never get it. I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon. Fuck the system, I'm that nigga. Bend the law, cut the rules. I'm about to risk it all. I ain't got too much to lose. Y'all been eating long enough. It's my turn to cut the food. Pass the plate. Where my drink?. This my day. Lucky you. Fuck you too, woah!. Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move. y'all gotta move. Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice. Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?. Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move. give me the juice. Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall. Turn my back on you all and you're finished. Back to these bullets, it's back to the job. Put my MAC on and all of you runnin'. Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushing. These packs and I'm actually pumpin'. Can't fuck what you rapping, you practically suckin'. You might've went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'. I'm actually buzzin' this time. Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine. I do not fuck with you guys. If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time. I ain't no gangster but I got some banging. Some chains and some blades in, and a couple of knives. Choppers and jammies, a partridge in a pear tree. My twelve days of Christmas was nothing but lies. Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo). They say I talk like a chulo. I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno. Bitch, I'm a dog call me Cujo. You play your cards, I reverse on you all. And I might just drop four like an Uno. Cállate boca mejor, maricón, liltle puto, and all of you culo. They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto. lookin' for something that prolly can never find out. Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now. What you would nigga? You really want me tied down. I've been alone, I never needed nobody. Just only me and my shotty. I'll tell these niggas to lie down. Keep all of the money I never wanted the lifestyle. I just pray to God that my son be alright now. I said ain't no love for the other side. or anyone who ever want smoke. When I die I'm going out as the underdog. who never lost hope. You in the wrong cab down the wrong path. Nigga wrong way, wrong road. Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast. I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower. I have said a lotta things in my day. I admit it, this is payback in a way. I regret it that I did it. I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em. Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition. Fuck's the difference?. I'm that cracker!. Bend the law. Fuck the rules. Man I used to risk it all. Now I got too much to lose. I been eating long enough. Man my stomach should be full. I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet. Lucky me. Fuck you think? (woo!). I got a couple of mansions, still I don't have any manners. You got a couple of ghost writers. but to these kids it don't actually matter. They're asking me ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop? "". I said ""I don't have any answers"". 'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album. it hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers. And actually coming from humble beginnings. I'm somewhat of uncomfortable winning. I wish I could say ""what a wonderful feeling"". We're on the upswing. like we're punching the ceiling. But nothing is stealing, like anyone has any fucking ability. To even stick to a subject, it's killing me. the inability to pin humility. Hatata batata. ""Why don't we make a bunch of fuckin' songs about nothin'. And mumble"", and fuck it. I'm goin' for the jugular. Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up. Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck. About the ones that were here before you to make raps. it's recap. Way back, MC's that. Recap, and tape decks. Eight DATs with the G raps and. Kane's at, we need three stacks. ASAP, and bring lap Masta Ace back. Because half of these rappers have brain damage. All the lean rappin', face tats. syruped out like tree sap. I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad but in fact. With a old-me at the same cat that would take that. Feedback and aim back, I need that. But I think it's inevitable. They all got button to press. or a lever to pull. It gives me the snap though (little bitch). And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big. But you've been taking the dicks. On the fuckin' gag, hoe (get it?). On the brink in a minute. Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything. With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits. I'ma sleep at the wheel again. As I peak into thinking about an evil intent. Of another beat 'em and kill again. 'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again. Even ketamine or methamphetamine. With the Manidon, it better be at least 70 to 300mg. And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up being a villain again. Levels to this shit I got an elevator. You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker. I sound like a broken record every time I break a record. Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator. Motherfucker never got a right to be this way. I got spite inside my DNA. But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, aye. It's the moment y'all been waiting for. Like California wishin' rain'd pour. And that drought y'all have been praying for. My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw. Still the same Marshall that outlaw. That they say is a writer might've fell off. But back on that bull like the cowboys. So y'all gotta move (yeah). y'all gotta move (yeah). y'all gotta move. Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice. Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?. Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move. give me the juice"

marshall mathers,"You know I just don't get it. Last year I was nobody. This year I'm sellin records. Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin. Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?. Get the fuck out of here. Chorus One: Eminem. You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers). I'm just a regular guy,. I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me). Nobody ever gave a fuck before,. all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me). Now everybody wanna run they mouth. and try to take shots at me (take shots at me). Yo, you might see me joggin, you might see me walkin. You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog. with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar. hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin. (grrrr, ARF ARF) Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun. Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in. Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous. blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is. Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace. Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this. Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em. and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets. And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches. I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous. and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin. startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (""God damnit!""). I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin. with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started. These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage. What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars. All I see is sissies in magazines smiling. Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?. Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned. passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?. New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick. Boy/girl groups make me sick. And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public. I'ma love it.. (hahaha). Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh). Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup). Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe). A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me. and run around screamin, ""I don't care, just bite me"" (nah nah). I think I was put here to annoy the world. and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl. Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer. and call themselves ""Clowns"" cause they look queer. Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay. Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks). And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out. Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out. after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out. (AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!. Look at y'all runnin your mouth again. when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10. And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females. in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails. ""Slim Anus,"" you damn right, Slim Anus. I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!. Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers). I'm not a wrestler guy,. I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me). Come and see me on the streets alone. if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me). And if you wanna run your mouth. then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me). Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?. You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy. Now because of this blonde mop that's on top. and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?. The underground just spunned around and did a 360. Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies. ""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,. so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"". My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million. She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin. Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?. All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress. Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?. It doesn't matter you {*several seconds of silence*} faggot!. Talkin about I fabricated my past. He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!). So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?. For every million I make, another relative sues. Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper. All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!). A half-brother and sister who never seen me. or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV. Now everybody's so happy and proud. I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house. Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand. to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp. Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast. and what do I see? A picture of my big white ass. Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:. uhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL. Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell. Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself"
maxine,"Artist: Eminem f/ Danaun Porter and 3. Maxine!! (Phone Rings). Maxine: Hello. Denaun: Can I speak to Maxine?. Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up?. Denaun: What up?. Maxine: Who dis?. Denaun: Denaun. Maxine: Yeah what's up?. Denaun: What are you doing?. Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed. Denaun: Huh?. Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed. Denaun: Why?. Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do. Verse 1: Eminem. I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine. She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean. Plus she got a sugar daddy. Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly. If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation. You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation. When you step away son, she got her face done. Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if. You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you. If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice. But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency. To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee. Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it. While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!). Verse 2: Denaun Porter. Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is. To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit. You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night. You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down. And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this. Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be. You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that. When you got niggas hiding in your closet. I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely. Verse 3: 3. I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me. So I stepped on it and then asked my homies. And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas. Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number. I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch... Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga. Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands. And said ""Oh it's like that?"". She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit. She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit. She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number. She asked could I give her mine two. Got to the crib and called her up. We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck. I said ""Maxine check this out,. Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"". Got to the crib she let me in. She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom. I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"". What the fuck are you doing?. So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing. As she went for my midsection. I threw her down as I tore off her shirt. Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work. Before I hit it she said. ""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"". I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok"". She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"". I got up out. Denaun: Hey, Maxine. Maxine: What. Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?. Maxine: Yeah for a small price. Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?. Maxine: You know, money nigga. Denaun: You don't need no damn money,. I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.. Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got?. Denaun: AIDS. Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit?. Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie. Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then. Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?. Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit,. so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,. I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga. Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you. Maxine: No, see... Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you. Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that. Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking... Maxine: (laughing as the phone hangs up)."

medicine man,"Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news. (Yeah, about that...). [Candice Pillay]. Don't let me find out, the bitch in you. Don't let me find out, the snitch in you. Fame and fortune. It's not your forte. Fuck the world now. I'm done with foreplay. Doctor's orders. Go fuck yourself. Take two a day. Set them on an overdose. And kill yourself. Doctor's orders. [Dr. Dre]. Listen, this is my evaluation. This shit over saturated, y'all can get evacuated. Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated. Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating. Ain't nobody graduating. Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it. That's why I gotta hate it. Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration. Damn I'm getting aggravated, fuck, I'm getting agitated. Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools. The police got our name in all they databases. Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two. Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages. Somebody tell me, what the fuck is going on?. These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fucking Matrix. It's looking like a sign of the revelation. 'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest. I got all these patients man. how come they ain't patient with me?. They just think I want the money, why?. When I can't take it with me. Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not. They gon' find out who you are. just admit 'fore you get admitted. [Anderson. Paak]. Say, what you living about. Fuck you gon' tell me. Do you remember how you started out though. You looking lost now. (You want a pass, oh damn). Fake it 'til you make it. Take your little paper book. When you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now. I'd rather be hated on for who I am. Than to be loved for who I'm not. That's word to doc. [Candice Pillay]. Fame and fortune.

Never thought about. how much my race and nationality meant. But based on how I ascended. see how plain it was now, they want me to jet. No one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'till I took off. Mistook me because I look soft. But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders). So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off. Decided opposing you is what I'm? posed to do alls. I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls. And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all. You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls. And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone. My picture jumps off a poster. and just floats through the halls. And fucking goes through the walls. like the ghost of Lou Rawls. Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter. I'm going in, already got an arm and head. And whoever said word are just words. Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck. Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit. Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned. In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like. They didn't deserve what they get. And whatever consequences come with every verse. it's worth it. So Doc turn the beat on. whose turn is it to get murdered on it?. And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime. As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind. I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine. Like a whole furrow. just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find. I'm starting to slow and these lines full of nines. I just load up the most rhymes. and open fire with a closed mind. All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's). Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time. Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders. I spray uh. Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun. Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none. I even make the bitches I rape cum. I'm waiting on someone to say something. Dre make the bass pump. and let the tape run for old time's sake. I spit it straight through, this is take one. The moment you're waiting for has come but. [Candice Pillay]. Fame and fortune. It's not your forte. Fuck the world now. I'm done with foreplay.

I can see you're sad, even when you smile,. even when you laugh. I can see it in your eyes,. deep inside you wanna cry. 'cause you're scared, I ain't there?. Daddy's with you in your prayers. No more crying, wipe them tears. Daddy's here, no more nightmares. We gon' pull together through it,. we gon' do it. Laney, uncle's crazy, ain't he?. Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it. We're all we got in this world. When it spins, when it swirls,. when it whirls, when it twirls. Two little beautiful girls. Lookin' puzzled, in a daze. I know it's confusing you. Daddy's always on the move,. mamma's always on the news. I try to keep you sheltered from it. but somehow it seems. the harder that I try to do that,. the more it backfires on me. All the things growing up his daddy. that he had to see. Daddy don't want you to see. but you see just as much as he did. We did not plan it to be this way,. your mother and me. But things have got so bad between us. I don't see us ever being together ever again. Like we used to be when we was teenagers. But then of course everything always happens for a reason. I guess it was never meant to be. But it's just something we have no control. over and that's what destiny is. But no more worries,. rest your head and go to sleep. Maybe one day we'll wake up. and this will all just be a dream. Chorus. Now hush little baby, don't you cry. Everything's gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya. Daddy's here to hold ya through the night. I know mommy's not here right now and. we don't know why. We fear how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby. But I promise, momma's gon' be alright. It's funny. I remember back one year. when daddy had no money. Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up. and stuck 'em under the tree. and said some of 'em were from me. 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em. I'll never forget that Christmas. I sat up the whole night crying. 'cause daddy felt like a bum,. see daddy had a job. But his job was to keep the food. on the table for you and mom. And at the time, every house that we lived in. either kept getting broke into and robbed. or shot up on the block and your mom. was saving money. for you in a jar. Tryna start a piggy bank for you. so you could go to college. Almost had a thousand dollars,. till someone broke in and stole it. And I know it hurt so bad. it broke your momma's heart. And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart. Mom and dad was arguin' a lot. so momma moved back. on the Chalmers in the flat,. one bedroom apartment. And dad moved back to the other side. of 8 Mile on Novara. And that's when daddy went to California with his Cd. and met Dr. Dre. And flew you and momma out to see me. But daddy had to work,. you and momma had to leave me. Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V.,. and momma didn't like it. And you and Laney were too young to understand it. Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit. And it all happened too fast. for either one of us to grab it. I'm just sorry you were there and. had to witness it first hand. 'cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud. Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscing. Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out. to see how much you both have grown,. it's almost like you're sisters now. Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here. Laney I'm talkin' to you too,. daddy's still here. I like the sound of that, yeah. It's got a ring to it don't it?. Shh, momma's only gone for the moment. Chorus. Now hush little baby, don't you cry. Everything's gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya. Daddy's here to hold ya through the night. I know mommy's not here right now and. we don't know why. We fear how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby. But I promise, momma's gon' be alright. And if you ask me too. Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird. I'ma give you the world. I'ma buy a diamond ring for you. I'ma sing for you. I'll do anything for you to see you smile. And if that mockingbird don't sing. and that ring don't shine. I'ma break that bird's neck. I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya. And make him eat every carat. Don't fuck with dad (haha)"
mockingbird (remix),"Lyrics. 2Pac:. I never had much, ran with a bad bunch. Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch. And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by. And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives. I never did cry, and even though I had. pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start. They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to. The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy. I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year. I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here. Never did like the police, let the whole world know. Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down. And facin me now, what do I do?. These thangs that a Thug goes through. And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong. It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on. . Chorus:. They say that things just cannot grow. beneath the winter snow,. or so I have been told.. They say were buried far,. just like a distant star. I simply cannot hold. . Eminem:. We're all we got in this world. When it spins, when it swirls. When it whirls, when it twirls. Two little beautiful girls. Lookin' puzzled, in a daze. I know it's confusing you. Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news. I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems. The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me. All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see. Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did. We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me. But things have gotten so bad between us. I don't see us ever being together ever again. Like we used to be when we was teenagers. But then of course everything always happens for a reason.

They say were buried far,. just like a distant star. I simply cannot hold. . 2Pac:. Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good. Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods. Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook. Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke. Then some lady named Billie Holiday. Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came. Little LaTasha sho' grown. Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home. Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us. When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band. Just think of all the people that you knew in the past. that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last. Picture a place that they exist, together. There has to be a place better than this, in heaven. So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin. Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion. . Chorus:. They say that things just cannot grow. beneath the winter snow,. or so I have been told.. They say were buried far,. just like a distant star. I simply cannot hold"
monkey see monkey do,"---intro----. [laughing]. Ay yo 50. What i tell you. We aint even have to say shit. They did it. [laughing]. [chorus]. Monkey see monkey do. Dont ever make the first move. Just let em' come to you. Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do. So let em' come to you. The rest of us follow suit. Monkey see monkey do. Tweedle-de-tweedle-dum. If they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come. Now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up. Check-mate motherfucker. Games over. We won. Tweedle-de-tweedle-dum. It doesnt take much. For me to raise such a stink up. When motherfuckers hate your guts. You aint even gotta say much. For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers. Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush. I cant explain what it is my brain does. But however it works its insane. Its plain nutz. And it aint just my brain thas dangerous. Its a whole combination of things. It takes nutz. And im not affriad to raise the stakes up. I got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks. For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us. Im patiently waiting for the day. Im anxious. To see the look on ya fake mugs. When you thugs go bankrupt. Ya drunk. Ya aint tough. Whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas. This is me talking motherfucker. This aint drugs. You wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up. FUCK THAT. Its too late chump now face up. I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does. Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off. Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off. So i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw. And give him the surgery that he came for. Till i pull the paint off. I never been shot. But i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth. Cause ive always came off. Like ja's chain. When they try to rush him and lost. And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it. I dont stop. The only thing i wait for. Is day that i dont gotta report to probate court. Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more. Cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw. Alot of rappers on my list that just aint ja. And ima read that motherfucker off from april. You pussies think i went soft since 8 mile. When i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls. Trust me. [chorus]. Monkey see monkey do. Dont ever make the first move. Just let em' come to you. Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do. So let em' come to you.

mosh,"""I pledge allegiance to the flag. Of the United States of America. And to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God. Indivisible..."". It feels so good to be back.... Mosh with me now.... You scrutinize every word. Memorize every line. I spit it once, refuel. Re-energize and rewind. I give sight to the blind. My insight through the mind. I exercise my right. To express when I feel it's time. It's just all in your mind. What you interpret it as. I say to fight, you take it. As I'mma whip someone's ass. If you don't understand. Don't even bother to ask. A father who has. Grown up with a fatherless past. Who has blown up now. To rap phenomenon that has. Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task. And in juggling both. Perhaps mastered his craft. Slash entrepreneur. Who has held onto few more rap acts. Who's had a few obstacles. Thrown his way through the last half. Of his career typical. Manure moving past that. Mr. kisses ass crack. He's a class act. Rubber band man. Yea, he just snaps back. Come along, follow me. As I lead through the darkness. As I provide just enough spark. That we need to proceed. Carry on, give me hope. Give me strength. Come with me. And I won't steer you wrong. Put your faith and your trust. As I guide us through the fog. To the light at the end of the tunnel. We gon' fight, we gon' charge. we gon' stomp, we gon' march. Through the swamp. We gon' mosh through the marsh. Take us right through the doors. C'mon. All the people up top. On the side and the middle. Come together, let's all bomb. And swamp just a little. Just let it gradually build. From the front to the back. All you can see is a sea of people. Some white and some black. Don't matter what color. All that matters: we gathered together. To celebrate for the same cause. Don't matter the weather. If it rains, let it rain. Yea, the wetter, the better. They ain't gonna stop us, they can't. We stronger now more than ever. They tell us ""no"" we say ""yea"". They tell us ""stop"" we say ""go"". Rebel with a rebel yell. Raise hell we gonna let'em know. Stomp, push, shove, mush. Fuck Bush!. Until they bring our troops home. C'mon. Just come along, follow me. As I lead through the darkness. As I provide just enough spark. That we need to proceed. Carry on, give me hope. Give me strength. Come with me. And I won't steer you wrong. Put your faith and your trust. As I guide us through the fog. To the light at the end of the tunnel. We gonna fight, we gonna charge. we gonna stomp, we gonna march. Through the swamp. We gonna mosh through the marsh. Take us right through the doors. C'mon. Imagine it pouring. It's raining down on us. Mosh pits outside the oval office. Someone's tryina tell us something. Maybe this is God. Just sayin' we're responsible. For this monster, this coward. That we have empowered. This is Bin Laden. Look at his head noddin'. How could we allow something like this. without pumping our fists?. Now this is our final hour. Let me be the voice. In your strength and your choice. Let me simplify the rhyme. Just to amplify the noise. Try to amplify the times it. And multiply by six.... Teen million people. Are equal at this high pitch. Maybe we can reach. Al Qaeda through my speech. Let the president answer. A higher anarchy. Strap him with an Ak-47. Let him go fight his own war. Let him impress Daddy that way. No more blood for oil. we got our own battles. To fight on our own soil. No more psychological warfare. To trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal. If we don't serve our own country. We're patronizing a hero. Look in his eyes, it's all lies. The stars and stripes. They've been swiped. Washed out and wiped. And replaced with his own face. Mosh now or die. If I get sniped tonight. You know why,. 'Cause I told you to fight. Come along, follow me. As I lead through the darkness. As I provide just enough spark. That we need to proceed. Carry on, give me hope. Give me strength. Come with me. And I won't steer you wrong. Put your faith and your trust. As I guide us through the fog. To the light at the end of the tunnel. We gonna fight, we gonna charge. we gonna stomp, we gonna march. Through the swamp. We gonna mosh through the marsh. Take us right through the doors. C'mon. And as we proceed. To Mosh through this desert storm. In these closing statements. If they should argue. Let us beg to differ. As we set aside our differences. And assemble our own army. To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction. That we call our president. For the present. And Mosh for the future of our next generation. To speak and be heard. Mr. President, Mr. Senator. Do you guy's hear us?. Hear us?"

music box,"[Intro]. Yo, yeah girl,. Can you hear that? It's playing our song... Are you sleepy? Take a nap... You're not afraid of the dark? Are you.?. [Verse One]. You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to. sleep. I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep. round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna. peep. But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos. I wanna eat. Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows. all so sweet. With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street. He's placing hot smoldering charcoals. beneath your feet. Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek. Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham. Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam. Flavor my favorite graham crackers with John Bennet. Rams. I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am. [Chorus]. (My music box). Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep. (My music box). But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My. music box). And when we're Worlds apart, you mean the World to me. (My music box). If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box). Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep. (My music box). I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music. box). So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music. box). Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box). [Verse Two]. I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross. I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose. Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug. my nose. My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I. know. I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run. around. Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred. pounds. There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the. sun is out. The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin'. it out. I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck. about'. Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my. house. They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music. box. Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked. I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts. I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts. Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark. The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess. I'll loom in the park. [Chorus]. [Verse Three]. I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin? this little. chick's. Neck like a pixie stick. The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get. horse-whippins,. I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in. Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'. The mortician of love, sent from above,. forced and treat em all (?). (?) stingy I've become. Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm. just numb. Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the. buns. The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the. ladder. I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window,. look at her. then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and. batter her. with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her. But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her. Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha. I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya. So strong is your fight, but your no match for. Dracula. Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her. Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her. Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera. Stand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela. [Chorus]. By: Narcotic"
must be the ganja,"[Intro]. Yeah... Oh, oh! Yeah Yeah...Oh.. I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing. I smell something in the air that's making me HIGH!. I smell something in the air that's making me HIGH!. [Verse 1]. Ok here we go, Do-re-mi-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti so. Lyrical rascal, kick back the tobasco. You motherfucker's must just not know the tic-tac-so. Time to show you the most kickass flow in the cosmos. Picasso with a pickaxe, a sick asshole. tic-tac-toe comes with sixpack, with exact doe. Knives, strangling wives with dick-lasso. 3 bags of the grass, Zig Zags, I'm with the Doc so. You know how that go, skull and the crossbones. This is poison to poison girls who do not know. You do not wanna try this at home my lovato. This is neither the time nor the place to get macho. So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos. Maybe some popcorn, watch the show and just rock slow. It's not what you expected, not what you thought so. Bout time you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke. [Chorus]. It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana. That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high. Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me. Whatever's got into me I don't mind. I said it's the Ganja, it's the marijuana. That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high. Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me. Whatever's got into me I don't mind. [Verse 2]. Your dreams are getting fulfilled, Ooh I'm literally getting a chill. Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill. You're submitting to skill, sitting still. I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real. Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama. And be calmer, ?? a step beyong a Jeffrey Dahma. Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama. Don't know if it's the lala, or the rum and pepsi mama. Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer. Be used as extra topping, then next time I make a pizza. How many people you know that can name every serial killer. Who ever existed in a row, put them in chronological order. Beginning with Jack the Ripper. Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper. Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped. The trunk that they was stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate. And which model, which state they found her and how they attacked the victim. Say what murder weapon was used to do what on which one. Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun. Don't stop, I like this it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun. [Chorus]. It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana. That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high. Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me. Whatever's got into me I don't mind. I said it's the Ganja, it's the marijuana. That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high. Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me. Whatever's got into me I don't mind. [Verse 3]. When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like. You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light. Behind the boards, it's Dre, legends are made this way. Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?. Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms. Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some. He can give her some, she can give them some. Get behind a lint drum, make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome. The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some. Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of. Capable of winning her, Bullets are, so unbelievable its a. Titanium cranium that's full of suprises. When the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes. You stare into your stereos (hi). Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing. I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking. [Chorus]. It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana. That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high. Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me. Whatever's got into me I don't mind. I said it's the Ganja, it's the marijuana. That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high. Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me. Whatever's got into me I don't mind"

Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest. And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it. All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number. It's 1-800-I'm-a-dick-sucker-I-love-to-suck-a-dick. And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me. Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key. And I'll be sure to get back. As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre. Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!). So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken. Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock, bawka-bi-kaw. Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick and stick a dick in your mouth. I'm done you can fuck off, fucka-fuck off!.

my band,"[Eminem]. I don't know dude. I think everybody's all jealous and shit. 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude. And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me dude. And they need to take it up with me after the show. Because.... CHORUS [Eminem]. These chicks don't even know the name of my band. But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands. 'cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man. All because I'm the lead singer of my band. [Eminem]. So I get off stage right, drop the mic. Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like. ""What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady. I'm the lead singer in D-12 baby"". They're all like ""Oh my God it's him"". ""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"". ""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"". ""Please won't you please let me suck your cock"". And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous. Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas. All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes. Throw their bras and their shirts and the panties on stage. So like every single night they pick a fight with me. But when we fight it's kinda like siblin' rivalry. 'cause they're back on stage the next night with me. ""Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me"". Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me. 'cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be. This rock star shit, it's the life for me. And all the other guys just despise me because. Chorus. My band (9x). [Swifty]. You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you?. Hey dad how come we don't rap on proto. Smash these vocals and do a performance. But we in the van and he in a tour bus. You don't want my autograph, you's a liar. And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva). And what the hell is wrong with that dressing room. 'cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal. See I know how to rap, it's simple but. all I did was read a Russell Simmons book. So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map. Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back. [Kuniva] Look him little punk ass thinkin' he the shit. [Kon Artis] Yeah I know man find himself takin' on a flick. [Kuniva] Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue. [Eminem] No! I had an interview, not you two. [Kuniva] You gonna be late for soundcheck. [Kon Artis] Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck. [Kuniva] But our mics are screwed up. [Kon Artis] And his always sound best. You know what man I'ma say somethin'. [Kuniva] Aiyo Em (You got somethin' to say?!). [Kon Artis] Man no. [Kuniva] I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man what's up. [Kon Artis] Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up. And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew. [Kuniva] Man I was 'bout to talk right after you I swear, I swear man. Chorus. [Proof]. They say the lead singer's rock, but the group is not. Once we sold out arenas to the amusement parks. I'ma go let the world know that Proof is hot. I should cut his mic off when the music starts. Ready to snap on a dumbass fan. Every time I hear... (Hey dude I love your band!). We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments. So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent. And these guys they can find every area code (Proof carry my bag). Bitch carry your own. Can't make it to the stage, security in my way. (Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!). [Bizarre]. God damn it I'm sick of this group. Time for me to go solo and make some loop. I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps. Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack. Lose Yourself video, I was in the back. Superman video, I was in the back. Fuck the media, I got some suggestions. Fuck Marshall, ask us a question. Like who's D-12, how we get started (But what about Eminem?). Bitch, are you retarded?. Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group. Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy). Then he told me to do sit-ups to get buff. I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up. Fuck D-12, I'm outta this band. I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne. [Eminem]. Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me. and it just tares my ass apart to know that you don't know my name. [Bizarre]. These chicks don't even know the name of my band (haha). But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall). 'cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah). All because I'm the lead singer.... [Eminem] My band (9x). [Bizarre] (In background). The hottest boy band in the world. D12!. [Eminem] (as a salsa singer). I'm the lead singer of my band. I get all the girl's to take off their underpants. And the lead singer of my band, my salsa. Makes all the pretty girl's want to dance. My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa"". My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa. My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance. And take off their underpants. My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance. And take off their underpants, my salsa. Where'd everybody go?"

my darling,"Ya look. [Verse 1]. If I woulda rap about the crap that's out, that's the route. You probably want me to take cause you're just dying to know what I think. Hear my take on some other rappers. If I was to say somethin about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your pants. Cause I'm White and he's White, so he's like my competition I mean, right. Nope, Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba, so b-b-b-b-b-b. But I don't compete with nobody. I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle. And dance around my opponents, do donuts. Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome. I'm like a sleepin giant and when I awake I'm like Dre. I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey. And sink my teeth in em and fill em, full of poison. And make a noise like a snake before I kill em. And let em know that I just don't feel em. And smack 'em with the backwards E on the Eminem emblem. I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face 'em. Tell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye, then waste 'em. And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell. Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell. In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls. For this rap game. And it g-g-goes. One-two-three, chk-chk one-two-three. Chk-chk one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me. There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me. Everybody bores me, they're just so corny. So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror. The mirror grows lips and it whispers ""Come nearer"". [Hook]. My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling. You and me were meant to be together my darling. And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling. Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body. I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling. You and me were meant to be together my darling. And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling. Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body. [Verse 2]. ""Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here. Talk to me, sit, here, pull up a chair. Why don't you cut your hair? Dye it back, come on, try it"". Ahh, no! I told you leave me the fuck alone, will you?. ""But I'm here to rebuild you"" But I already killed you!. ""But Shady, we were meant for each other, think about your mother"". Yeah, so what of her?. ""You think about what she did to you and your little brother, all them foster homes. "" Fuck you mothafucka!. I had you beat! ""No, I was playin possum, remember?. I let you watch your little girls blossom. I gave you enough time,. Your soul's mine. I'm takin it back"" You fuckin bitch, why?!. ""Because I love you, look a little closer. Isn't that us on that poster?"". . [Hook]. My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling. You and me were meant to be together my darling. And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling. Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body. I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling. You and me were meant to be together my darling. And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling. Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body. [Verse 3]. ""Shady, listen *crowd screams Shady*, you hear that?. They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back"". But I don't want it back. ""Yes you do"". No I don't. ""Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later"". No I won't. ""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor"". Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday. ""Well I got him on the phone right now"". You're lyin'.... ""Yo, Slim!"" How, why now?!. What up Dre?. ""Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya. I don't know it just seems like ever since you got off your. Drugs, you became a lot softer"". But Dre, all Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and Vodka. ""Well, just think about it Slim, I don't care. Just hit me back and let me know what's up"". Fuck this mirror! (Ahh!). ""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you"". Fuck you, die you son of a bitch!. ""Put the gun down"" Bye bye! *gunshot*. Ok, I'm still alive ""So am I too,. You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to (ha ha ha ha). You sold your soul to me, need I remind you. You remember that night you. Prayed to God, you'd give anything to get a record deal when Dre signed you. This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right through. Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!. Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too. That you're just now seeing that downside to. Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too. Ain't even sure if your kids like you. Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquil. Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle. But together we can break the cycle. Marshall, ""Whatt!!"". No one's gonna love you like I do. [Hook]. My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling. You and me were meant to be together my darling. And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling. Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body. I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling. You and me were meant to be together my darling.

my fault,"I never meant to feed you mushrooms girl. I never meant to bring you to my world. and now you sitting in the corner crying. and now it's My fault my fault, liar.. [Eminem]. I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave. And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved. A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up. with first aid tape and raped on the first date. Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin. who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?). Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!). I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen. It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin. C'mere, let's go in here"" *knocks on the door*. ""Who's in the den?"". [R] ""It's me and Kelly!"". ""My bad, (sorry) let's try another room"".

[G] Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so drab. ""Oh dag!!"". [G] What?. ""I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!"". [G] Huh?!. Chorus: 1st repeat Em says ""I'm sorry!"" at the end. 2nd repeat same as original Chorus. ""Yo Sue!"". [G] Get away from me, I don't know you. Oh shoot, she's tripping... [G] I need to go puke!! (Bleahh!). I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major. I just wanted to make you appreciate nature. Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya. The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you. So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?. That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out. She said,. [G] Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!. I said, ""I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t-shirt"" (Let go!). ""Would you calm down you're startin to scare me"". She said,. [G] I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married. I don't even have any kids and I can't cook. (Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!.

my life,"(Adam Levine). My life, my life. Makes me wanna run away. There's no place to go. No place to go. All the confusion. It's an illusion like a movie. Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try. (50 Cent). Yeah, 03, I went from back filthy to filthy rich. Man, the emotions change. So I can never trust a bitch. I tried to help niggas get on,. They turned around and spit. Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick. Now when you hear 'em. It may sound like it's some other shit. Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits. I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned. If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned. I'm doing what I'm supposed to,. I'm a writer, I'm a fighter. Entrepeneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me manoeuver. What's it to ya?. The track I lace it, it's better than basic. This is my recovery, my comeback, kid. (Adam Levine). My life, my life. Makes me wanna run away. There's no place to go. No place to go. All the confusion. It's an illusion like a movie. Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try. (Eminem). While you were sipping your own kool-aid. Getting your buzz heavy. I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete. Sipping some of of that revenge juice,. Getting my taste buds ready. To whoop down this spaghetti,. Or should I say this spaghett-even?. I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting. Thought he was finished, motherfucker,. it's only the beginning. He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin',. Fuck who he's offending. He'll rip your vocal chords out. And have them bitches plugged in me. Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity. Now take the other end, dump them. Then pluck them motherfuckers. In each one of your eyesockets cause I thought. You might finally fucking see. That'll teach you to go voicing. Your cocksuckin' opinion to me. I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit. Fuck letting up,. You're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me. Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah,. It's happening again. I'm thinking about the same. Mother fuck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50!. Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go. I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this. More than anybody knows. I'm trapped, so all I do is rap,. But everytime I rap I'm more trapped. And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh oh,. I guess it's bubble wrap. This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis. Christ, how was I supposed to know. Shit would turn up like it did?. Feels like I'm going psycho again. And I might just blow my lid. Shit,. I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid. Cause I'm running in circles with. (Adam Levine). My life, my life. Makes me wanna run away. There's no place to go. No place to go. All the confusion. It's an illusion like a movie. Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try. (50 Cent). I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid. Sold like 40 million records,. People forgot what I did. Maybe this is for me, maybe. Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy. Maybe I'll do it 3 AM in the morning like Shady. Psycho killer, Michael Myers,. I'm on fire like a lighter. Tryna say the same classic,. Get your ass kicked. Man crook, wrap your head up in plastic. Pussy, now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots. It's tragic, it's sad it's. Never gonna end, now we number one again. With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate. Accept it, respect it. This a gift God gave me like the air in the lungs. And every fucking thing with it. (Adam Levine). My life, my life. Makes me wanna run away. There's no place to go. No place to go. All the confusion. It's an illusion like a movie. Got nowhere to go. Nowhere to run and hide. No matter how hard I try"

my natural habitat,"Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat. Am I underground, or am I just a spoiled brat. I drink a litre of tylenol. Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol. Fuckit. Giving it a 110% but luckily I ain’t gotta pay the rent. School goes on. Switching your mind thoughts on. English German they’re all the same. Gotta do homework everyday but hey. It’s ok cuz in your life it clears a way which you can take. Without having to fake a diploma. And end up in a coma. Cuz you couldn’t pay the dealer…nothing can get realer. Cheaper, unless you become a keeper for some ice-hockey team in the NHL. Cuz that will tell you that everything will get well. That you won’t need to sell your wife to get away from the knife. I remember when I was younger and funner. But I was no good runner, I could scream like thunder, my neighbour was a hunter. Hunting, blunting, that’s a fun thing. yeh really it is. Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat. Shoot your grandma cuz she looks like a cat. I drink a litre of tylenol. Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol. Fuckit. Bling bling, I’m tired of everything. Ding dong I sing a song for this chick wearing a thong. I wanna stay alive, I wanna survive and I wanna perform live. I need time. To heal cuz there’s no chance that I will kneel down like a clown and frown. It’s time to cheer, not shed a tear but I fear that death is coming near. I can hear it from the rear, I can see it clear. I got support from my friends. But everything tends to send me to court. I lock myself in my fort it’s the kinda sort that send me a package of Blends. To my porch lighting a torch to see the world I envy. Everything can be nothing to see this is me. Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat. Shoot your grandma cuz she looks like a cat. I drink a litre of tylenol. Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol. Fuckit. I will tell you about what runs my life. It’s the hate, and the rate of thoughts. Living on tequila shots and cuttin myself wit knives. My brain dives into a nothingness. A bottomless hole. Filled with pain and sorrow. No time to borrow a rhyme to make things aight. Cuz it’s pointless. Timeless. I’m tired of this. I wanna be famous. And entertainous. All I see is pain. And all I feel is rain. Hitting my overheated brain. This is insane. How can one person make you feel like this. Make you just wanna diss. And give another one a fake kiss. I approve with this wrist. And remove my foolish pulse. That beats for nothing. At least now you’ll have something. To think about. This will be the last time you hurt me, cuz I hurt myself. Then I shout. Fall to the ground. Now things will turn around. Will I maybe be happy now. I bow to thee. The mistress of depressed horror. I’m infested, not the least bit interested. In life. This is what will happen now. I will pull out this mag. And aim it toward my head. I will say that you’re a fag. Then I’m dead. Will anyone miss me. Or is the world so full with greed. That people try to keep what I twirled. Aiyo this is me in my natural habitat. Am I underground, or am I just a spoiled brat. I drink a litre of tylenol. Petrol is what runs my role, no ethanol. Fuckit. Natural Habitat continues until music fades"

Threatened to shut me down at your little fuckin Source magazine. if I come back then you would attack me, bitch you attacked me first. take it like a man and shut the fuck up. and fuck your little magazine too. I dont need your fuckin magazine, I got XXL number anywayz. And yall cant stand it cuz there gettin bigger than yall. oh, and by the way, howed I look on the VMAs?. When you was watchin me from whatever fuckin TV you was watchin me from in. Boston. The mean streets of Boston, fuckin sissy. Like you got us scared in the motherfucker, suck our motherfuckin dicks. Oh, and for those thats dont know, dont get it twisted yo, The Source has a white owner!!!"
need me (ft. p!nk),"You are drunk, the coffee is burned. I hate to find you like this. I always find you like this. I come home and clean up your mess. What would you do without that?. Why do I always come back?. Oh, what I wouldn't do for you. And I'm starting to think. that maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. And I'm starting to think. that maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Some nights I want to run for the hills. It's never easy with you. I cannot reason with you. But your smile is as rare as it comes. What would I do without that. Maybe that's why I come back. Oh, what I wouldn't do for you. And I'm starting to think. that maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. And I'm starting to think. that maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Starting to think we were made. for each other. But one of us in this relationship. is raising the other. You remind me of my mother. We drive one another crazy as each other. And we're both adults so there's. no excuse for the games. that we play with each other. Where you at? At a friend's?. No, you ain't, motherfucker. But I give her the benefit of the doubt. Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver. When I touch her,. 'cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker. Our bottom lip can quiver. when she's in trouble,. she's in hot water. Think I caught her cheating again. Give her another chance?. Another one after that?. I'm swimming in that Egyptian river,. 'cause I'm in denial. Say I don't eat shit,. but I got a shit-eating grin. when I smile. Making an excuse for us to act it out. She's just acting out, with her inner child. Then I set the truth on fire. Cause I'd rather believe a lie then. I breathe a sigh of relieve that. I don't believe in. Going to bed mad. I keep on trying. to make a bad girl good. But haven't I stood by you in good times?. And bad?. I'm starting to feel like. your god damn dad. 'Cause I literally. feel like you could die. ""Should I leave me for good?"". You never would. It'd be all bad. Never understood why they call it goodbye. But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy. And you're a good person, too. I can save you, I can make you change. But I keep putting my fucking foot in my mouth. Every time I gotta come and bail you out. When you get in trouble that you get yourself in. And I'm in trouble but I can't leave. I'll sell you out!. I could never turn my fuckin' back on you. What is that?. I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticing it. But somehow it's like every time. I'm about to go to end it. I ain't got the cojones to do it. Nor the heart,. our apartment's tore apart. You're using my heart for a dart board. But God must've aligned stars for us. 'Cause somebody paired us up. And they say he ain't. capable of making a mistake. But this one's perfect. 'Cause I'm.... And I'm starting to think. that maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. And I'm starting to think. that maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me"

Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something,. you know what I'm saying? Cause I'm tired of being broke. Verse 1:. Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern. And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn. Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh. My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh. Cause man I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free. Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see. I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery.

Yeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'?. Verse 2:. Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business. I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this. Financial interest is the matter at hand. I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand. I grab what I can and do what I must. Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose. The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got. Fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot. The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme. Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time. My crews true and divine, we never fronted. We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred. Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives. It's all about a man planning what his future is.

"never enough (feat. 50 cent, nate dogg)","[Eminem]. There's not much you could do or say to phase me. People think I'm a little bit crazy. I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll. Have to step in every once in a while to save me. To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things. Sometimes I forget what other people just may think. A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me. If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me. I maybe a little too fast paced and racy. Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times. 'cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem. like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing. And I could give a fuck what category you place me. Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone. As long as you place me amongst one of them greats. When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z. For every single die hard fan who embraced me. I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me. And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me. Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me. In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me. It only made me what I am today, see. Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me. You ain't gonna make or break me. Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G. You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening. 'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me. And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me. You had all this time to think about it. Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me. 'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day. That we finally meet in the same place to see. Chorus [Nate Dogg]. No matter how many battles I've been in and won. No matter how many magazines on my nuts. No matter how many Mc's I've end up. Ohh, it's never enough. No matter how many battles I've been in and won. No matter how many magazines on my nuts. No matter how many Mc's I eat up. Ohh, ohh, it's never enough. [50 Cent]. My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it (Uh oh). It gets worse when I go back to the basics. You go, say the wrong shit and get your face split. The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it. The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit. Graze it, your peace talk, save it. Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated. I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers. If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse. Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?. I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it. To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic. My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it. Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate. Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it. When it's hot, it's hot. Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it. Chorus"
nice guy (feat. jessie reyez),"You're such a nice guy, a nice guy. You're faithful, you don't lie. After the club, you go back home, right?. R-I-I-IGHT? S-I-I-IKE!. Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man. Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man. I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck. Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man. I hop in your whip and take a sip, then I gun it. I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you runnin'. I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cummin'. I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you runnin'. I'm not a cheater. but if I'ma be accused, might as well be. You tell me you'll take me back. when hell freezes. but females be Rushin' me outside my telly. temptation overwhelms me. Like my monthly bill from Sprint. they chargin' me for a selfie. Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key. Eh, I was tryna be nice. You're such a nice guy, a nice guy. You're faithful, you don't lie. After the club, you go back home, right?. R-I-I-IGHT? S-I-I-IKE!. Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch. Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man. I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck. Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch. I play your music while you suffer. like I'm Carmine Coppola. You're tied up in the basement. while I chill on your sofa. La próxima yo sé que mejor me quedo sola. Estás de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola. I'm an emotional wreck, weak (uh-huh). Everything over-affects me (yeah). When you joke, it upsets me (yeah). You say I'm no good at sex. And you think I'm gross and unsexy (uh-huh). I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks (yep). You hope I choke on a Pepsi (yep). Bitch, you was supposed to correct me! (oh). Been textin' you since three. I still get no fucking reply. You say you sleep alone. but yet your mattress is king size. Fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots?. Cut it out, bitch. I doubt that you're goin' to house sit. In that outfit, and those skin-tight Levi's. Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie. Oh, it's spring time. time for you to have a fling like a slingshot. You say don't come over 'cause you got pink eye. But I think I got just the thing, why. Don't I bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?"
no apologies,"In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter. My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up. Arsenic writer, author with arthritis. Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis. Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed. dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick. quick witted, for every lyric spitted. There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it, so quick. This dynamite stick buried the wick. it's gonna explode any minute, some lunatic lit it, and it's not Nelly. Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling, I quit so. Stop dwelling an' I am not failing. You fuckers are not ready, 'cause I got jelly. like [Beyoncé's] pot belly, this is ""Destiny"". Yes money I'm of running. so get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening. Chorus. No apologies. Nah suckers I'm not sorry you can all sue me. Y'all could be the cause of me. No apologies. Y'all feelin' the force of me, no remorse for me. like there was no recourse for me. No apologies. I'm not even acknowledging you at all. till I get a call that God's coming. No apologies. Laugh fuckers it's all funny. I can spit in your face while your standin' across from me, no apologies. My head hit's the pillow, a weeping willow. I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows. But these chellos, help just to keep me mellow. Hand's on my head, touched knees to elbows. I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over. These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me. I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough. So keep playing it and stand next to the subs. I choke mics like asphyxiation. when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin' (Haha!). Fuck yeah I'm a basket case and I mastered this rap shit. till my ass gets wasted. Till my assassination. till I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation. 44 mags a fascination. a taste for disaster, and if that's the case then.... Chorus. This song isn't for you, it's for me, a true Mc. it's what it do just to see if he still has it. And if his skills mastered. he's able to spill raps long after his killed that's a, real Mc. Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree. As long as there's still this hunger and will in me. then expect a longer life expectancy. I'd be a savage beast, if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside. I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an' mourning. So I'm warning you, don't coax me, it's silly. I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing. who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be, fooled. The press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid. they don't know 'cause they don't see that I'm wounded. all they did was ballooned it. I'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos cartoon did. that's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'. an' they can suck my dick while I'm pukin'. an' you too, you can.... Expect no sympathy from me, I'm an Mc. this is how I'm supposed to be, cold as a g. My heart's frozen it don't even beat. so expect no apologies. Expect no sympathy from me, I'm an Mc. this is how I'm supposed to be, cold as a g. My heart's frozen it don't even beat. so expect no apologies"
no love (feat. lil wayne),"(Verse 1). Young Money yeah... uh. Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower. But it's ""fuck the world"", get a child out her. Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her. Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers. I'm rolling sweets, I'm smoking sour. Married to the game but she broke her vows. That's why my bars are full of broken bottles. And my night stands are full of open bibles. I think about more than I forget. But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat. And these niqqas know I lay them down, make your bed. Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg. Money outweighing problems on the triple beam. I'm sticking to the script, you niqqas skipping scenes. Be good or be good at it. Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic. Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's ""fuck what they say"". I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away. Man, I come down in a couple of days. Ok, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode. I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code. It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode. All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole. So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down. No love lost, no love found. (Hook). It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now. You kicked me when I was down. But what you say just (don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more). Bitch you get (no love). You show me nothing but hate. You ran me into the ground. But what comes around goes around. And you don't (don't hurt me). You (don't hurt me no more). Bitch you get (no love, no love, no love, no love). Bitch you get (no love, no love, no love). And I don't need you (no more). Get em. (Verse 2). I'm alive again. More alive than I have been in my whole entire life. I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin. To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most. Shit's finna get thick again. They say the competition is stiff. But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in. I ain't never giving in again. Caution to the wind, complete freedom. Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em. So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em. They call me a freak cause. I like to spit on these pussies fore I eat 'em. Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage. Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?. Snatch the mic from him, bitch Imma let you finish in a minute. Yeah the rap is tight. But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time. So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um. Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit. And start over from scratch and write new ones. But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference. When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight. It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump. In the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow. Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd. You can see the sparks from hot metal. Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game. I so started to rock fellow. When I'm not even in my harshest. You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow. 'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop. I'm standing on my Monopoly board. That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop. 'Til my hip don't hop anymore. When you so good that you can't say it. Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore. People just get sick cause you spit. These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore. And you can never break my stride. You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow. You'll never take my pride. Killing the flow, slow venom any opponent. Is getting no mercy, mark my words. Ain't letting up, relentless. I smell blood, I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell. Where was you when I fell and needed help up?. You get no love. (Hook). It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now. You kicked me when I was down. But what you say, just (don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more). Bitch you get (no love). You show me nothing but hate. You ran me into the ground. But what comes around goes around. And you don't (don't hurt me). You (don't hurt me no more). Bitch you get (no love, no love, no love, no love). Bitch you get (no love, no love, no love). And I don't need you (no more). Bitch you get no (love)"

no return (feat. drake & tyga),"[Chorus]. My heart is telling me to be different. Its about time for me to move on. Swallow everything, that I learned. I'm at a point of no return. (no return x7). I'm at a point of no return.. Man it feels like these walls are closing in,. this roof is caving in,. Oop its time to raise it then. Your days are numbered like pages in my book. Of rhymes got em cookem boy. This crooked mind of mine got em all shook. And scared to look in my eyes,. I stole that fuckin clock, i took the time and. I came up from behind. And pretty much snuck up and butt f-cked this game up. Better be careful when you bring my name up fuck this fame. That ain't what i came to claim,. but the game ain't gonna be the same. On the day that i leave it. I swear one way or another i'ma make. these f-ckin haters believe it,. I swear to god won't spear the rod, i'm a man of my word. So your fuckin heads better nod. I'm gonna fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody. Sleep on me that pillow is where your head will lie,. Permanently biych it's beddy-bye,. This world is my easter egg, yeah, prepare to die'. My head is swoll. My confidence is up. This stage is my pedastal. I'm unstoppable the incredible hulk. Your trapped in my medicine ball. I can run circles around you. So fast your fuckin head will spin dog,. I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, i'll fuckin. [Chorus]. My heart is telling me to be different. Its about time for me to move on. Swallow everything, that i learned. I'm at a point of no return. (no return x7). I'm at a point of no return.. One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain. And i swear i got this shit that makes these bitches go insane. So they tell me that they love me. I know better than that it's just game. It's just what comes from fame. And i'm ready for that i'm just saying. I really can't complain, everything is kosher. Two thumbs up, ebert and roeper. I really can't see the end getting any closer. But i'll probably still be the man when everything is over. So i'm riding through the city with my high beams on. Can you see me can you see me get your visine on. Y'all just do not fit the picture. Turn your wide screen on. If you thinking i'm gonna quit before i die dream on. Man they treat me like a legend. Am i really this cold. I'm really too young to be feeling this old. It's about time you admit it who you kidding man. Nobody's ever done it like i did it. [Chorus]. My heart is telling me to be different. Its about time for me to move on. Swallow everything, that i learned. I'm at a point of no return. (no return x7). I'm at a point of no return.. I'm hot motherfucker, get a plate bitch. Don't say shit, get your face lift. Rozay bitch let the champagne drip. Niggas swag jack, but this l.A. Shit. Get it back, give it back ain't 'bout shit. Snap back them ain't even rare where the tag a what. Wack ass all up in my ear bitch bag back. I bag bad bitches motherfucker kat stacks. Yellow nigga, no cabs. Got the phantom out, no mats. Get your camera out uh, one flash. Hot beams steady shot clap your ass. Aw, t. Raw i'm so uh. Loc's on, chucks low, black beanie dog. Patron top wash straight from the liquor store. I'm turned up i can't feel my face so. [Chorus]. My heart is telling me to be different. Its about time for me to move on. Swallow everything, that i learned. I'm at a point of no return. (no return x7). I'm at a point of no return."
normal,"Yo, how do I keep. (Man, I don't know what's up with these hoes, man). Gettin' in relationships like this?. (I'm just sayin'). Maybe it says somethin' about me. (Yeah, yup). Should I look in the mirror?. I just want you to be normal. Why can't you bitches be normal?. Always gotta be so extra. Why you always need a lecture?. My ex hates to talk, she's a texter. Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her. Wants to get back together. Said not 'til she gets her act together. She thinks I'm bein' mean and now. She starts to scream and shout. She's about to let the demons out. She don't want to see me with other females out. I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route. She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house. In an evening gown with her cleavage out. We've been down this road too many times for me to count. And all I can think is how—. I just want you to be normal. Why can't you bitches be normal?. Always gotta be so extra. Like a fuckin' terrestrial. Guess it comes with the territory. My ex girl, she just declared war. Therefore, I better prepare for it. I guess bein' weird's normal. And I don't know what's got a hold of me. Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci. I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted. So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's. The first thing I think of when I wake up. And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep. Psych, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse. I know she cheats, so do I. I'm soulless, she's heartless. No wonder we're partners. Both got hundreds of charges. Domestic disputes but we've always. Swept it under the carpet. Even when 911 gets the call that. I slipped up and busted her jaw with. A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it. Really does is make our love. For each other grow stronger. She won me over the second she tried to run me over. Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over. Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over. But why is she so wicked?. And how the fuck did I get so twisted. Up with someone so unlikeable and shifty. We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with. Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing. She's only mine for the time being. That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she. Tried to two-time me. And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave. How could I be so naive?. Should I leave or turn this entire evening. Into a motherfucking crime scene?. Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him. You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!. Especially when you're the one cheated first. Now the argument immediately becomes heated. You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt. Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita. Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it. Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!. I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though. In our business your friends like to pry so. You've got 'em all under cover just like moles. Hopin' they'll come back with intel. But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral. 'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go. Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone. Who the fuck's Milo?. The guy at work who drives a hi-lo. I put a tracking device on your Chrysler. And follow you while you drive home. But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown. You recognize me and had Milo flip me off. Right out the passenger side window. I hit a light pole, you skrt off. And then pull up at 5AM in the drive. In a stretched white limo. Stumble in the side door. and hit me in the head with Milo's demo. But like a drunk bum, what do I know?. Let's sleep on it like they did Revival. I told you you're the apple of my eye. So shut your pie hole. Just wanna be normal. Why can't you be normal? (Yeah). I just wanna be normal. Why can't you be normal?"
not afraid,"(Chorus). I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let me know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road. Yeah, It's been a ride.... I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one. Now some of you might still be in that place. If you're trying to get out, just follow me. I'll get you there. You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper. Before I lay em. But you won't take this thing out these words. before I say em. Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me. from causing mayhem. When I say em or do something. I do it, I don't give a damn. What you think?. I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world. Feed it beans, it's gassed up,. If a thing's stopping me. I'mma be what I set out to be,. Without a doubt undoubtedly. And all those who look down on me. I'm tearing down your balcony. No if ands or buts. Don't try to ask him why or how can he. From Infinite down to the last. Relapse album he's still shit and. Whether he's on salary, paid hourly. Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him. Whichever comes first, for better or worse. He's married to the game,. Like a fuck you for christmas. His gift is a curse,. Forget the earth he's got the urge. To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe. (Chorus). I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let me know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road. Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit,. And cut the crap. I shouldn't have to rhyme these words. In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap. You said you was king, you lied through your teeth. For that fuck your feelings,. Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped. And to the fans, I'll never let you down again,. I'm back. I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact. Let's be honest, that last Relapse Cd was ""ehhhh"". Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground. Relax, I ain't going back to that now. All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack Blaow. Cause I ain't playin' around. There's a game called circle and I don't know how. I'm way too up to back down. But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out. Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't. This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around. But it's time to exorcise these demons. These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!. (Chorus). I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let me know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road. And I just can't keep living this way. So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage. I'm standing up, Imma face my demons. I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground. I've had enough, now I'm so fed up. Time to put my life back together right now. It was my decision to keep it clean, I did it for me. Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you. So I could come back a brand new me,. You helped see me through. And don't even realise what you did,. Believe me you. I been through the ringer,. But they can do little to the middle finger. I think I got a tear in my eye,. I feel like the king of... My world, haters can make. Like bees with no stingers, and drop dead. No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on,. I promise. To focus soley on handling my responsibility's. As a father. So I solemnly swear to. Always treat this roof like my. Daughters and raise it. You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely. Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club. Or a corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up. Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon. But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not. (Chorus). I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let me know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

Cause you don’t want none of it. Rappers always try but they always die. And rappers always stuck to me and tried to lie. (Arf, Arf). Yo, where my dogs at. Yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at. In the house, It really doesn’t matter cause I still turn it out. When I step on this mic, smacking your spouse. Ha, Ha. The illest MC to come off the top. When I get this drum off. Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath. And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left. I’m wanted for theft and robbery. And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G. Cause she don’t want none of me. I’m the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and you’ll see. That I’m from the friggen D. Ya’ll don’t get my point I’m from Detroit. Smoking fake grass like a joint. That’s the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life. But, at the end of the night I’ll still be fucking your wife. Shit, I really don’t care your style needs to switch. Cause you ain’t rich, that’s why you ain’t rich. Remain underground, can’t come off the top. You can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this. I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear. Rappers always wanna stand clear. I’m a motherfucking landmine. Ya’ll don’t understand mine. I’m Slim Shady showing out like my tan line. Ha, ha. The illest MC to rhyme. Every time the illest MC of our time. I rhyme time and time twice but I’m nice. With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple. I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe. Up in the bathroom I shouldn’t have but yo I boinked. To any MC up in this shit who want some. To any MC who wanna step up and get some. Get done, fuck competition. Let me catch my breath one more time. Yo, I’m on a mission. To stomp any MC comp I just trunked. And swamp is this truamp unheard, no its not. Yo, but here I go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that I slow. Driving MC’s crazy, Slim Shady, up in your motherfucking radio baby"

offended,"You claim if you get knocked by the cops. You'll give 'em not even a statement. Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff. Karate kick the plaintiff. Gotti with the stainless. I'll just call it shoddy entertainment. If y'all was in the party gettin' faded. On molly, had the audience sedated. You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted. Probably let it fall and hit the pavement. But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it. Bitch, stop bein' a lame. Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs. Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells. And chainsawing them in the basement. Hardly fits your job description. Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'"". Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?. Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it. I need to stop bein' debated. You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel. Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee. Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy. This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts, never sensible. Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone. But till I get the President to respond. My pen and pencil is a missile launcher. And send it to Mitch Mcconnell. Just as big of a bitch as Donald. Shit's on, bruh. Let me sing this shit soprano. While I do it pizzicato. Ivanka, stiff arm her. While I'm hittin' on Melania. And this song's for all ya. 'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me. They want me to go eat some worms. I hope you offended. And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt. But I'ma make you eat your words. I hope you offended. You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up. 'Cause you're only gonna make things worse. I hope you offended. 'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up. 'Til everybody eats my turds. These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me. Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery. Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam. I'm gettin' handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest. I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs. From a daddy longleg. And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera. Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat. I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic. With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent. Twice your age and I'm actin' half it. Grow up? Nah. Not that I know of, y'all. Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed. Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball. Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal. While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal. You're so appalled (Em), so's my manager. Bitch I'm amateur, fuck a pro career. Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here. And nobody's close, so don't compare. They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here. My competition can't see me. 'Cause I don't own a mirror. But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted. I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it. Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it. Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs. But I made strides with these rape lines. I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes. Like Ray Rice when he Facetimes. Bang, bang, bang, bang time. Dang knives to butcher them gay wives. You're gonna need sutures the same size. As the blade I push into captcha. Pull 'em like... sleigh rides. Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times. To make it on Dateline. I came to stake my claim like a canine. Waitin' in a buffet line. So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre. Come play, belly dance on me. I've been making wedding plans all day. 'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me. They want me to go eat some worms. I hope you offended. And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt. But I'ma make you eat your words. I hope you offended. You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up. 'Cause you're only gonna make things worse. I hope you offended. 'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up. 'Til everybody eats my turds. Eight year old with the wordplay. Girl, take this pole like a survey. Today wasn't my birthday. But I'm caked up like a dessert tray. So we're in shape. 'Cause you're in a slurrin' state. I'm a ten, you're an eight, like what I do before, after, and during rape. You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?. And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him. R. Kelly with a full bladder. Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar. But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' knowledge my degrees. It's the same as I got in college. (Zero). But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect. I owe you nada like lodi partner that blow me. Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water. With some floaties on. And get the soap, and try to get the Pope to hold me. While you hose me off And nope I won't be washed. You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though. I got a lotta more. I won't put the sugar coating on it though. 'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired. Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped. You feel like a wet pile of crap. But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh. I get why you're tapped. But you gotta get your fire back. Catch fire, get upset and fire back. Is what I tell myself. When times get bad. 'Cause sometimes I might get sad. Well I take the same advice I had. And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag. Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad. 'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags. I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me. I'm right in your ass. 'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school). You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude. Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it. Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted. But then I think about it and I'm enraged. 'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid. For the time I spent to put the pen to the page. It'd be minimum wage. But it's embedded in my head and I never hunted for the bread and butter. What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of. But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen. And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal. Or forget I was ever this incredible. I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get. Another mothafuckin' opportunity again. To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can. 'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me. They want me to go eat some worms. I hope you offended. And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt. But I'ma make you eat your words. I hope you offended. You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up. 'Cause you're only gonna make things worse. I hope you offended. 'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up. 'Til everybody eats my turds"
oh no,"[Intro]. Oh no what?s happening to my brain. I can?t believe this is happening again. [Verse 1]. Lava out my lips I flips. Wake up think I have a cramp. I?m trying to shove the lava lamp up my father?s ass. I think I?m out of gas, man. I think I need another mask. I?d ask my mother but I think she?s laughing at the plants. A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp?s. I think I?ll eat some Ambiens like they?re candied yams. Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack. Abraf-ckingcadabra motherf-cker look who?s back. Just like a pendulum, Satan?s pentagram swings. I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing. Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing. While I was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring. First I Re-up, then I Relapse. Go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc. And I?ll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle. Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see Nyquil. [Hook]. Oh no. Here we go again. When it?s going to end. Where did it begin. Maybe way back when. . [Verse 2]. Into the well, baby Jessica fell. She may have wetted herself. Quit playing, get her some help. Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail. Every day in journals saying how. She wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo. I?m the medicine man. My medical marijuana was prescribed by a doctor. Shove a typewriter up her. Perez Hilton?s ass, shit, almost forgot that. He?s always shoving something up his ass so why not that?. And f-ck it while I?m venting let?s shove a vending machine. Up his rear end when he?s bending over pretending that he. Didn?t say anything that would be offending to me. Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G. Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?. Put him under the stairs? People are already under there. Hmm, I wonder where. Wait, I think the cubpoard?s bare. Stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there. [Hook]. [Verse 3]. Vicodin?s like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin. I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again. I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again. Who am I kidding? I couldn?t quit this shit if my life depends. I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then. Yeah, rehab?s nice, I had my name up in lights again. You see that?s why I can?t decipher what life I?m in. I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then. It sounds so enticing, isn?t it nice when I?m hype again?. I?m nice when I?m like this, no time to write just type it in. If I could get my pen to slow down, what?d I write just then?. Man I?m about to hyperventilate, I just have hyper-tension. I have the type of mental state you couldn?t comprehend. Unusually stupid of you for you to think I?m your friend. I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence. I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again. [Hook]"
old time's sake (feat. dr. dre),"[Eminem]. Good evening... This is your fucking captain speaking. We will soon be reaching an altitude of 4 million and a half feet. That's 8 million miles in the sky. Please undo your seatbelt for takeoff. You are now free to smoke up out the cabinet. .. [Dr. Dre]. I'm Dre from back in the day from. Nwa from black and the grey from. Chokin' a bitch to smackin' her face from. Stackin' up bodies to rackin' the K's up?. From rackin' up hits to stackin' the crates up. I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm. And what was happenin' in rap entertainment. Me and Shady, far as competition faggot there ain't none. .. [Eminem]. Speak of the devil, it's attack of the Rainman. Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron. Soon as the blade spun, vrum they run away from. Who wanna play dungeon, no one is safe from. In search of a brain surgeon, a great one. Wait it ain't funny man, it's urgent I need one. Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun. And an emergency squirt gun to spray-a one. .. [Chorus]. So one more time for old time's sake. Dre drop that beat and scratch that break. And just blow a little bit of that smoke my way. And let's go (You're now smokin' with the best, best). .. So one more time for old time's sake. Dre drop that beat and scratch that break. And just send a little bit of that smoke my way. And let's go (You're now smokin' with the best, best). [Eminem]. .. Smoke signal in the sky like verizon wireless. A nice environment, suprise entirely. hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrant. Takin' lives of firemen, say goodbye here I am again. Naked wives and vicodin. Before I begin to get to so high pussyboy I could spin. Vin vin Fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge. Let the boy off the bench coach, and throw it to him. There he goes in his trenchcoat, no clothes again. Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin. I show you every inch grows in my foreskin. Show me nipple, I pinch both and throw up a ten. Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again. The sorceror of intercourse, if it's forced it's him. Don't fight the feelin' if you're feeling the force within. When you wake up in the mornin' next to the porcelain. .. [Chorus]. .. [Dr. Dre]. Now when there's smoke there's fire. When there's fire there's flames. When there's flames there's Chronic. Either you high or you ain't. I got no time for no games. .. [Eminem]. Naah uh he ain't playin'. He's gon' get the Ak and aim it right at your bra-ain. I'm slightly insa-ane, back on Creatine. Hypnotic and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink. And It's givin' me wings, I believe I can fly. While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me Csi. It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake. Dre get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake. .. [Dr. Dre]. .. Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke. And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know. We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it. Let's get in to it, your smokin' with the triedest and truest. I got the midas touch, when it comes to rollin' shit up. You mother fuckers ain't smokin' you just holdin' shit up. Now here we go let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt. I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one. Cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed. Now them words are just a little more personal for me. Seein' as how, I blew up off from puffin' them trees. .. [Eminem]. We're smokin' up for me, fuck yeah light it up cheech. Cmon smoke me out cuz, gimme contact buzz. Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff. But this is earth callin', Shady man cmon back What. Man we're losin' him, he won't even respond back, Fuck. Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn bitches). Dre it's hot, I think he better go check on their temperatures. I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages. Now baby just bend over, just more of the damn bitches. .. [Chorus]"

Cold hearted as spiderman throwin' a spider in the snow. So ya better get to blowin in flow rider. Inside of a low rider with no tires in the hole. Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?. Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the hoes?. Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets. This isn't gob this is a blister in the salt. Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost. Shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz. Wrap a lizard in gauze, beat you in the jaws with it. Grab the scissors and saws. And cut out your livers gizzards and balls. Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws. So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw. Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all. Got the gall to make Chris piss in his draws. Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog. You're on fire. That's how ya know your on a roll. 'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold. Your on fire. Man, I'm so fuckin' sick, I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit. You're on fire. Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit. To give the whole hip hop shop the blow. You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire. I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses. If you mistook the for a song, look. This ain't a song it's a warnin' to Brooke Hogan and David Cook. That the crook just took over so book. Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it. I'm lightning in a skillet, your a fuckin' flash in a pan. I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan. Mr Mathers is the man. Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy. And stash it in a can, come back and whip your ass with it again. Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand it'll eat through. Anything metal the ass of iron man. Turn him into plastic so for you to think. That you could stand a fuckin' chance is assanine. Yeah, ask the nine man, hit a blind man with a coloring book. And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon. Fuck it I ain't playin', pull up in a van and hop out. At a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'. Vietnam vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man. Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand. So if I seem a little mean to you. This ain't savage you ain't never seen the brew. You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route. You couldn't make a belemic puke. On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut boo. Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick don't nobody care. Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air. I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there. Nobody will fuckin' test me 'cause these hos won't even dare. I'm wastin' punchlines but I got so many to spare. I just thought of another one that might go here. Naw, don't waste it save it, psycho, yeah. Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair. You're on fire. That's how ya know your on a roll. 'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold.

one day at a time,"(Part 1: Tupac). Sometimes its hard, to wake up in the morning. Mind full of demons, I dont wanna hear 'em anymore. Got me heartbroken, fine, So many babies screamin. Cuz they seeing destruction before they see a human being. So they start smokin weed, we'll never get our day. Until we learn to pray, keep our families safe. Cuz they all broken, why? Two ghetto birds die. Before we learn to fly. Somebody else can say im pokin guns, smokin weed. Can all make the change so im told but i havent seen a change unfold. I keep hopin, please! If you prefer to breath. Communities in need, of people that we lead. Keep your eyes open now, then only say I try. Until the day I die, I promised to be wise. With my heart open, greed, brings only misery. A weight of tragedy, so I stay sucker free. Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise. Dont be afraid to try, too many of us die. For the thought of hopen wise, my brothers speak wise. They focus on the prize, till everybody dies. (Part 2: Eminem). We could only learn to take, our anger and our hate. Control our mental state, settle down and just set it straight. Maybe we could learn to take, a second to pump the brakes. But we said it, regret it later, and let it escalade. Cuz by then its just too late, theres so much we can take. Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate. Till the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes. You think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes. But we aint, his brain will go against. With every artist comes an image he portrays. And a picture that he paints. But in the midst of all this anger and this gangs. Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangsta. And I aint hear no complaints. But I know, that I will always continue to grow. As long as I lead, and never follow noone else's shadow. There will never be another me, and that I will guarantee. Its that why I remain sucker free, to this day. The game, will never be the same. No matter how much fame or success they attain. There will never be another me. And no matter what they do, there will never be another you. You can search but you'll never find. You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds. We will never die, we are forever alive. When we continue going, one day at a time. (Part 3: Outlawz #1). Dont get caught in the publicity, and caught in the hype. Rappers are, regular people minus money and lights. Searchin for, fortune and fame and super stardom. All the jewelry, all the cars, who screws the hardest. Now the Hip Hop Police's surveillance is watchin. And the kids think beef is their only option. Outlawz, poor and filthy, guilty as charged. My memories they can die, my -Makaveli- lives on. You think the industry is fun, and no pity with guns. And when your money is up, thats when your enemies come. So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap. We needin a change, the drama remains. (Part 4: Outlawz #2). I spend my whole life,(yeah) fightin myself. That, I cant win, so I'm invitin some help. And every now and then, I take rights on the left. I'm still just like a kid, lookin for stripes on my belt. That day is a fight in itself. So I just pray and hope God take a light to myself. No matter how much I try to stay alive, I'mma die, mad. Still standin and in love with my pride. (Part 5: Outlawz #3). My hard frivilous beef, we passed that. Im tryna keep some in c-comin and then collect on my ass cap. But rappers in the game aint changed. And I finally realized that we not in the same game. The hatin will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it. Them 4-5 a cop, chillers just I'm still with it. Them streets is military, you gotta be a soldier. Gotta stay lirry and keep your eyes on the Rollers. They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us. So we gotta do it, we gotta do to keep growin. One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind. When we continue growin, one day at a time (Damn!)"
one last time,"Shady Aftermath. G-Unit!. [Chorus- Eminem]. Cause we came here to set this party off. Right let's bounce tonight. And if they don't let us in through the front.

I'm a trend I set one everytime I'm in. I go out and just come back full circle again. You a fad, that means you're somethin that we already had. But once you're gone you don't come back. [Eminem]. Too bad you're off the map now, radar can't even find you. We stay on the grind you slip we out grind you. You walk around mad you let your anger blind you. We walk around just playin the violin behind you. Enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin. Sittin observed, listen you'll learn if you pay attention. While 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond. World wide we on the charts with a bullet we're still climbin'. [Chorus- Eminem]. Cause we came here to set this party off. Right let's bounce tonight. And if they don't let us through the front. We'll come through the side. Cause I don't wanna ever leave the game. Without atleast sayin good-bye. So all my people on my left. All my people on my right swing one last time. When Dr. Dre says crunk you will get it crunk. Get it crunk [Crunk crunk crunk]. And when 50 Cent says jump. You will get on one foot and [Jump jump jump]. [Verse 2]. [Dr. Dre]. The buzz is tremendous we drop you all just sense it. I don't gotta promote it for you to know the Doc is off the benches. [Eminem]. We keep the party rockin off the hinges. We ain't showin off, we just goin off popular concenses. [Dr. Dre]. But critics say the Doc is soft, Doc is talk. The Doc is all washed up knock it off. Who the fuck is Doc impressin. Doc is this Doc is that you got the wrong impression. You must be on the cock of Doc cuz Doc left you all guessin. So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record. We gonna have this mothafucka hoppin in a second. Thats why we always save the best cut last. To make a scratch and itch to it like fresh cut grass. [Eminem]. Cause we just playin with the sharks wrestlin with alligators. Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasnt for rap. Embraced the gat or maybe raised to be racist who may have never. Got to see our faces, graced the cover of Rolling stone pages. Broke down barriers of language and races, just call on the. Cape crusaiders and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic. And we can play the back and forth all day like the hot potatoe game. Thats why we. [Chorus- Eminem]. Cause we came here to set this party off. Right let's bounce tonight. And if they don't let us through the front. We'll come through the side. Cause I don't wanna ever leave the game. Without atleast sayin good-bye. So all my people on my left. All my people on my right swing one last time. 50 Cent come on!. [Verse 3]. [50 Cent]. Bounce now hands up you know how we do. We make the club jump everywhere we go. It's no secret everybody know when Dre's involved. There's plenty money involved. [Dr. Dre]. And plenty honies involved and sunny sunday's and palm trees. Cali everyday is just another party from the vallies. All the way to them 8 mile alleys. [Eminem]. Let's ralley hands up for the grand finale now raise up your seat. Dre's about to speak blaze a pound of weed six days about the week. [Dr. Dre]. You can catch me in the studio bangin out the beats to. Provide you with the heat that keep blazin out ya speaker. [Eminem]. So never say never cuz Shady Aftermath together. Along with G-Unit records presents the return of the. The Doc and Shady no one can do it better. We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence of the. [Chorus- Eminem]. Cause we came here to set this party off. Right let's bounce tonight. And if they don't let us through the front. We'll come through the side. Cause I don't wanna ever leave the game. Without atleast sayin good-bye. So all my people on my left. All my people on my right swing one last time. [Outro- Eminem]. Still Aftermath. 2006. And don't worry bout that detox album. It's comin, we gon make Dre do it. Ha ha. 50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizze. Stat Quo, Dr. Dre we ain't leavin let's go. By NeNéU"
one shot 2 shot (feat. d12),"{*gun shots, crowd screaming*}. I told y'all motherfuckers I was comin back (oh shit). What now nigga, what now? What? Brewster Projects nigga. [Chorus: Eminem]. One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots. All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops. Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops. Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin shots off. [Bizarre]. Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club. And I'm tryin to run and get my motherfuckin gun. (Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife. I'm tryin to run and save my motherfuckin life. Oh, shit! The shooter's comin. Bitches hollerin, niggaz runnin. People, shot all over the floor. And I'm tryin to make it to the St. Andrew's door. {hey man) {*chk-chk-Boom*} That's the sound of the glock. Even Dj Houseshoes fucked around and got shot. I done messed around, and forget my tec. I don't see nobody, but Fat Five and Hex. [Eminem] Kuniva you aight?. [Kuniva] These niggaz is trippin. [Eminem] Where's Bizarre at?. [Kuniva]. I'm tryin to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at. Bitches screamin everywhere and niggaz is whylin. Two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin. This chick is clingin on to me, sobbin and sighin. Sayin she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin. But it's real and it's on and caps is gettin peeled. So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and. {*blam* Ahh!} She got hit and now she's yellin {Don'T Leave Me!}. I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me. I squeezed through the back door and made my escape. I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!. [Chorus]. [Kon Artis] I been tryin to call you all day motherfucker where you at?. [Swifty Mc] I'm on 7 Mile {*gunfire*} what the fuck was that?. [Swifty Mc] {*gunfire*} Damn, somebody hit me from the back!. [Kon Artis] What with they car?. [Swifty Mc] With a gat nigga, and my tire flat. [Swifty Mc] {*crash*} And I just hit a pole, them niggaz some hoes. [Kon Artis] Is you hit?. [Swifty Mc] I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove. [Swifty Mc] It was a black Mitsubishi. [Kon Arist] Shit, that's the click we beefin with. [Swifty Mc] Maaaaan!. [Kon Artis] I swear. [Swifty Mcvey]. And I was on my way there. Believe me, I'm leavin a carcass today. And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way. I'm in the mood to strut, my Ak ain't even tucked. I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. I never seen no shit like this in my life before. People are still camped out from the night before. Sleepin outside the door, waitin in line still. tryin to get inside the club to see D-12 perform. The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small. People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd. fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot. Gets in an argument over a parking spot. Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off. Missed who he's aimin for, six feet away is the door. into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flyin all over the place. Grazed one bitch in the face. Another one of 'em came through the wall. Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off. I'm posted up at the bar, havin a mazeltov. Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off. Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun. And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him. Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre. Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!. I never saw him run so fast in my life. Look at him haulin ass, I think he left his wife. There she is, on the ground, bein trampled. I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her. {*blam*} God damn, there just went another damn bullet. I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it. It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it. I scoop D, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and. made it to the front door and collapsed. on the steps looked up and I seen Swift. Shootin it out but I can't see who he's shootin it out with. But Denaun's right behind him, squeezin his four-fifth. [Chorus]. [Kon Artis]. Yo, it's a Friday night, came to this bitch right. Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right. I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight. Although I can't stay here to fight cause I'm poppin niggaz tonight. That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge. Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryin to check when I get in. Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck. that shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker. So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show. The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo'). I just wanna know who drivin the black Mitsubishi?. He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece. [Chorus]"

A stomped your man so unless you want what he got. You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot. I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask. If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask. It's an amazing task to battle with success. I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less. And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians. Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions. Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you. When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra.

our house,"Here's the story, of a little boy.. Growin' up in a suburban home,. Trying to cope with everyday life,. Who lives in a little house,. That was built, in the middle of the street.. ""Hey, Mom!. Tupac's on the juke box,. so what he shot two cops,. and raped a little girl,. while two dudes watched,"". ""Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him,. You wouldn't have Two Pack Shaker,"". ""No! That ain't how you say his name, mum!. You're so lame,. Don't you know anything?"". ""Yeah!. I know that you'll probably go,. and join in a gang,"". ""Yeah, right. Im out. Where's my fuckin' walkman at?"". ""Stop cussin' at me!"". ""Shut up, bitch!"". ""And quit talking black."". Well,. Slammed the door and I'm out,. Now, what?. It's probably warm in the house.. Fuck, I forgot my jacket,. forgot it was winter.. I'm gettin' thinner,. I'm hungry.. Is Mom cookin' dinner?. ""Mom!. Let me back in!. I forgot my coat.. Mom, come on, I'm not playin',. It's cold!. Alright, sorry.. I need a jacket,. Mom, look,. My Tupac tape,. I just cracked it,. Ma, please let me back in,. It is Two Pack Shaker,. I just asked him."". I'm freezin', (achoo). I'm sneezin',. I'm breathin' too much cold air,. I'm wheezin',. ""I ain't did nothin',. I didnâ€™t say ""I'm leavin',"". I said ""I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin',"""". (scissors cutting). ""Alright, here.. Take your damn coat and leave,"". ""Fine, I'll lea-,. Mom! You cut off the sleaves!"". (Chorus 4x). Our house,. In the middle of the street.. One, two, three,. My teacher's two faced,. She went to lower my school grades,. Since Last Tuesday,. I had a toothache,. from kool-aid,. So Mom kicked me out, (get out). And, all i had in my suitcase,. Was one shoelace,. A tube sock,. and a tube of toothpaste,. Sometimes,. It was cool,. ""cause I could go to a friend's,. Crash there,. Fool around and just skip school.. But other times,. I'd rather just be home,. In my own room alone,. Read my shit and nobody would know,. My little brother sucked on a bottle,. 'Til he was six,. So I'd hide it inside the couch,. And say ""I don't know where it is,"". But as soon as Mom found it,. I would either be grounded,. or kicked out the house,. a thousand weeks,.. and still countin',. Even when I was underage,. Mom was tellin' cops,. I was tryin' to run away,. I told her,. ""Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay,"". Please, Mom, Please, Mom, Please, Mom,. I wanna stay, (let me stay). (Chorus 4x). My brother's incoherint,. Mom's a single parent,. Who ain't carin',. Starin' through me,. Like I'm transparent,. Made it clear,. That I was just there,. to run an errands,. Told her friends,. I was a son from her last marriage,. Sent me up to the little corner store,. with a little note,. ""Please, sell my step-son,. Some cigarettes so I can smoke,"". One time,. I tried to fake sick,. To get attention,. Back-fired,. Mom, sent me to school,. With a vengence,. My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me,. I go to class,. and every teacher's always laughin' at me,. And Mom says white rappers are laughed at.. Not only that,. She heard me upstairs,. I can't rap,. and I'm stupid,. I never make an average,. of a B+,. I need to sit on my ass and sue people,. Like she does,. One time, I got food poison,. From a hot dog,. Mom sued and got $2,000,. From Ballpark,. ""Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"". ""I don't think so.. Now keep an eye on your brother,. I'm goin' to bingo."". ""But, Mom. You said you were broke."". ""Who said?. You got your ears messed up,. from that damn rap music.""."

paul (skit),"[Skit: Paul Rosenberg]. Hey Em, It's Paul.. Umm, I listened to the new album. Umm, are you really gonna just reply to everybody. who you don't like. what they have to say uh, about you. or the stuff you're working on?.

Kamikaze 2. the album where you reply to everybody. who didn't like the album that you made. replying to everybody. that didn't like the previous album. It's a slippery slope. I-I don't know if it's a really good idea. Uh, anyway, hit me back"
paul (skit) (1),"""Em, it's Paul, um... I just listened to entire album. you gotta be fucking kidding me. I mean with this Christopher Reeves shit. you know the guy's dead, right?. And then the whole gay, stepfather incest rape thing?. I don't have you're back on this one. I can't even fuckin' handle it. I'm done. """
paul rosenberg,"Paul Rosenberg Speaking On Answering Machine. Em, it's Paul, listen.... Joe Just called me and he told me you're in the. fuckin. back behind the studio....

phenomenal,"I am phenomenal. With every ounce of my blood. With every breath in my lungs. Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal. I am phenomenal. However long that it takes. I'll go to whatever lengths. It's gonna make me a monster though. I am phenomenal. But I would never say, oh, it's impossible. Cause I'm born to be phenomenal. Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles. Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll. Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em. When the going got rough. Show 'em what I done thought that was the worse, little sissy. Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?. There ain't no situation. that you ever had to respond to that's adverse. The messiest thing you've ever gone through. Is your purse. Yeah, I don't try like Captain, I might as well. Hang it up like a shelf. Gotta keep growin' with it, evolve. Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall. But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick. Until you apply yourself. Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself. Inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go. In the waters where nobody else has gone before. Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so. Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant. Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am. I am phenomenal. With every ounce of my blood. With every breath in my lungs. Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal. I am phenomenal. However long that it takes. I'll go to whatever lengths. It's gonna make me a monster though. I am phenomenal. But I would never say, oh, it's impossible. 'Cause I'm born to be phenomenal. Let me self-empower you. When you're down. And they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you. When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel. I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel. Convert it to gunpowder too. Now what you do is. Put the match to the charcoal fluid. Put a spark to it. Like Martha Stewart barbecuing. Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it. Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it. Now you gon' take that rage. And make that what you raise. Never take back what you say. If you stay trapped in your brain. Engage in this fueled cage match. Ready to scrap asap. Take your fists to his bones. Show Biggie who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace. Yeah I picture 'em all as plastic and foam. Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at. And set it off like a placemat. (I am phenomenal). And I want you to say that. I am phenomenal. With every ounce of my blood. With every breath in my lungs. Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal. I am phenomenal. However long that it takes. I'll go to whatever lengths. It's gonna make me a monster though. I am phenomenal. But I would never say, oh, it's impossible. Cause I'm born to be phenomenal. Phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal. Step into the unknown and find yourself. You're floating freely, no emotion. Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-up valve. Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed. Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground. Cause I worked my butt off now. It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about. Cause I stuck it out. Like a motherfucking tongue to tie. I responded when I got shoved around. You're gonna have down believers. But when you're beyond belief. You probably shouldn't wonder how. Get it how you live. But are you prepared to give more than you get?. And put in twice what you get back from this shit. Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give. Rap is my shiv. But it's like my shield at the same time I wield. I'ma knife this will. Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill. How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt. I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb. Ready to face it, each challenge waitin'. Taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation. Look what I have built, reputation is delegation. The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing. Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement. An accusation, I am legendary status, in fact. That is the only way you'll ever be able to say. Your legend is makin' an allegation. I write with the left. Same hand I hold the mic with. As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath. Managed to prove who the best man is. Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing. In the end. But I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage. Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw. Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed. Cause I am. I am phenomenal. With every ounce of my blood. With every breath in my lungs. Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal. I am phenomenal. However long that it takes. I'll go to whatever lengths. It's gonna make me a monster though. I am phenomenal. But I would never say, oh, it's impossible. Cause I'm born to be phenomenal. Phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal"

pills...,"Well, I do pop pills. I keep my tube socks filled. And pop the same shit that got Tupac killed. Spit game to these hos. Like a soap opera episode. Then punch a bitch in the nose. Until her whole face explodes. There's three things I hate: Girls, women, and bitches. I'm that vicious to talk up and drop-kick midgets. They call me ""Boogie Night"". A stalker that walks awkward. Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg. Coming through the airport sluggish, walking on crutches. And hit a pregnant bitch in the stomach with luggage. It's like a dream, I can't back out, I black out. I'm back out, looking for someone ""of"" to beat. the ""crap out"". I'm bringing you rap singers. Two middle fingers. Flip you off in French and translate it in English. Then I'm gonna vanish from the face of this planet."

pooh butt day,"Chaos Kid. Get up this morning, I'm feeling sleepy as all hell. Went the use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell. All the way downstairs onto the couch. And I pissed my pants on the way down south. So I went back upstairs to change my underwear. Took a while to get em unstuck from my pubic hair. Finally got unzipped I went to put em down the street. But then I threw em in the garbage cause it all said pew. Hopped in the shower put shampoo in my hair. Went to rinse it out but then the water wasn't there. That damn toilet it must of went foul. Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel. Went to get my clothes but I couldn't wear the wash. So I sat and played some Mario on my Nintendo. I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff man today. I just feel like a pooh butt. Sometimes things just never go my way you know. I, I'm just feeling like a pooh butt today. Chaos Kid. Now every single day I make habits to get up. But today I just feel like a pooh butt so ill stay in bed. I don't know whats wrong with me. I'm just taking everything nonchalantly. I just feel like I can't move one muscle. My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle. My plane leaves to roll about quarter to 8. It's 7: 15 looks like I'm gonna be late. Aww forget that baby said I just can't make it. I know you're disappointed but your gonna have to take it. I'm sick in bed I'm making [?] foot it. But before hung up the phone she told me where I could put it. Comes next day I got a call from M&M he said. (We gotta make a record get ya butt outta bed). I said I ain't doin nothing I wish you nothing. But luck he said (What's up?) I said I feel like a pooh but. Sometimes things just never go my way you know. I, I'm just feelin like a pooh butt today. Chaos Kid. ""Yo you ever have one of those poohie. Stinky ridiculous rotten days, M&M"" (M&M). ""man I had one once check this out"". Eminem. Woke up, 6: 30 in the morning yawning. Gotta get to the recording studio. I gotta get a take done put all my rhymes together. So I can make one get outta bed fall on my head. Slipped on the rug I thought I was dead. Cussin I think my head is busted. But it really nothing only a concussion shake it off. Get off the ground look around. Couldn't find my rhyme sheets where'd I put em down. They were just there last night on the chair. Had to look everywhere but, couldn't find em anywhere. Go to the basement might of misplaced em. Gotta find em in hurry but my visions still blurry. Goin down the stairs what could happen next. But, when its this early you can't skip steps. Fallin head first as I fall I curse things are lookin bad. Ima only get worse; aching I shake and I hurt. I stand up slowly wiped all the dirt off memory lapse. I can't remember nothing think ill collapse. If you forget the whole thing pause for a second. What was I looking for... oh yea my rhyme sheets. They might be on the floor or on the chair wait a minute. Where am I I'm in a basement damn how does time fly. Think for a second record my memory. If I were a rhyme sheet where would I be?. Now I remember I put em in the closet next to my jacket. So I woulda never lost em. Already 7 I've only got an hour to eat breakfast. Get dressed plus take a shower got undressed. Got the zest off the rack turn the water on. And I almost had a heart attack. Cold as hell started to yell jumped out the shower. And said fuck it ill smell grabbed the towel off the rack. Dried off got dressed still had to eat. But my hair was a mess I was in a rush. Grabbed the brush and ran run into the door on the floor. I land always to fate now I know I'm curse. I think it might help if I open the door. First tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist. But thats what happens on a day like this. Sometimes things just never go my way you know I. I'm just feelin like a pooh butt today. Chaos Kid. ""Wow, that sounds pretty poohie to me"". M&M. ""Now, I'm gonna break it down. For those who don't know what a pooh butt day is"". Eminem. Now a pooh butt day is something everybody's. Had no particular depression neither mad or sad. You couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is cause. When you're feeling like a pooh butt then your feeling like shit"
psychopath killer (feat. salughterhouse & yelawolf),"[Royce da 5'9""]. I guess you could consider it poetry. But with me it started out with just words, just words. They started looking like puzzle pieces. So I started connecting them to each other. 'Til they started to resemble blank canvases. By this time I was an artist. So I just started to see these pictures, these real visuals. I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer. [Yelawolf]. (I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer. I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer. A psychopath, I'm a killer. A psychopath, I'm a killer). Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night. Sayin' I'm a killer. Did you ever think you would come to find?. Maybe in my dreams. [Royce da 5'9""]. I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain. Lyrical murder is somethin' I've been about. Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin' in class. Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head. Ruler in his ass. With a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off. Prolly symbolic of this thought, sick tot. To my inner enemy in a rush. I'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams. With anything less than a full bank. It's like I'm General Hong, and I'm standin' in front of a gun. I'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank. The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't. Yeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard. Every award show, we don't even get considered. How do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical. To a kid who wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him?. Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit. Beef on me and Shady who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit. We put the world onto it so watch how you say ""fuck me"". You just might jinx yourself, whoop, your girl gon' do it. Cause I was in that 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time. I had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity. And if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer. [Yelawolf]. (I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer). You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer. (A psychopath, I'm a killer). Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose. (A psychopath, I'm a killer). Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer. (A psychopath, I'm a killer). [KXNG CROOKED]. It's an elite drinker, it's the ringleader. I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher. With a street sweeper full of heat seekers. In your Jeep speakers I'mma keep ringers. I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver. Welcome to the slaughterhouse. Niggas try to tell me I spell too much. Capital S to the laugh to the T-E-R. Ho, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word. Making work disappear quick as magic. Abracadabra, the trafficker blacker than Africa. Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood?. Money like Dracula, hand him some spatula. Ask me a question. Am I the best with the flexing?. Fuck yes with the goon talk. I just moonwalk all over the beat. Then I'm lightin' up the street. CROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller. I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer. [Yelawolf]. (I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer). You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer. (A psychopath, I'm a killer). Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose. (A psychopath, I'm a killer). Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer. (A psychopath, I'm a killer). Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night. Sayin' I'm a killer. Did you ever think you would come to find?. Maybe in my dreams. [Eminem]. The thought of retiring. Is makin' me want to set your daughter on fire. With a soldering ironing. What up mom, applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?. I'm hopin' to fill up your opening. Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements. First I gotta accept you in the lobby and the aisle and. You've probably already been with all the slaughter. And I am in. No mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin. With no strings attached. I'm just the product of a hostile environment. But bein' brought up so brought up inspired. But I don't know why. It's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool. Not an appliance, but applyin' this science. I psychotically rhyme. And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance. Heart of a lion, balls of Goliath. Obscene talkin', the twine like a beanstalk and the vine. But I keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right. But everything I write seems wrong and it's like. I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause. In the fabric of our modern society. Now Catholics are panicking. Cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans. Dammit, the Pope's mad again. Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican. With that mannequin. Singin' ""Bagpipes from Baghdad"" again. In my dad's drag draggin' a faggot in a Glad bag. Won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance. Like that again. You thought I was lyin'. When I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again. I've lost my mind, caution oh God. I think I've just thought of another fucking line. Forgive me father, for I have sinned. But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak. Defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet. Probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant. After he's fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony. Tryin' to sneak by it. While his feet stomp, follow me while I revive rap. I'ma start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it. You're not gonna, might as well. Just hit the block in your joggin' attire in. Boston, across the marathon finish line and I. Put your thoughts against mine. Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life. Worse than Dzhokhar's. And I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire. Your bars are like Barney Fife. With a fucking swiss army knife. A saber that's Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight. With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up. I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie. I perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song. So it's hard for the rhyme to end. Like fuck 'em all I'm just ridin. Like I'm locked up inside a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car. Uncle Ronnie is driving. 'Bout to burst in through the side door. Of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room. [Yelawolf]. (I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer). You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer. (A psychopath, I'm a killer). Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose. (A psychopath, I'm a killer). Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer. (A psychopath, I'm a killer)"

puke,"[Sounds of someone puking]. There I go--thinking of you again. [Chorus]. You don't know how sick you make me. You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach. Every time I think of you, I puke. You must just not know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ho. You may not think you do, but you do. Every time I think of you, I puke. (1st verse). I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem. But off of the dome would probably be a little more, more suitable, for this type of song, whoa. I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think a. Sixteen bars this ain't enough to put some ink ta. So fuck it I'ma start right here I'll just be brief I'm. Bout to rattle off some other reasons.. I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo, of you. On my arm but what do I go and do ?. I go and get another one, now I got two. hooooo. Now. I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin. I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again. My next girlfriend now her names gotta be Kim. Shiiiiiit!. If you only knew, how much I hated you. For every mother fuckin thing you've ever put us through. Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you. Booooo-Hoooo.. [Chorus]. You don't know how sick you make me.

Every time I think of you, I puke (2nd verse). I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter. But I thought a song would probably be a little better. Instead of a letter. That you'd probably just shread up. Yeah.. I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think a. How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta. a stupid piece a,paper.. I'd rather let you see how. Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle. You're a fuckin' cokehead slut, I hope you fuckin' die. I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye. I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut I hope you die. Diiieeee.. But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad. It's not that I still love you it's not 'cause I want you back. It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna yack.Aaaaaaaak.. But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue. Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to. But every time I think of you now all I wanna do. Is puuukke!. [Chorus]. You don't know how sick you make me. You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach. Every time I think of you I puke. You must just not know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ho. You may not think you do. but you do every time I think of you, I puke"
purple pills,"Chorus: Eminem. I've been so many places. I've seen so many faces. But nothing compares. To these blue and yellow purple pills. I climbed the highest mountain. Once or twice but who's countin'. But nothing compares. To these blue and yellow purple pills. [Eminem]. Cool, calm, just like my mom. With a couple of law suits inside her palms. It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve. Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves. I can't describe the vibe I get. When I drive by 6 people. And 5 I hit. Ah shit. I started a mosh pit. Squashed a chick. And lost the foster kids. This room makes me hallucinate. Then I sweat till I start losing weight. Till I see dumb shit start happenin'. Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again. So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce. I said c'mon bounce. Everybody in the house doin' mass amounts. To the women in the thongs with they asses out. We don't bullshit, better ask around. D12 throws the bomb to gas your town. Bizarre, your mom is crashing now. Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out. [Kon Artist & Kuniva]. Fuck that, someone help Denaun. He's upstairs wrestling with Elton John. Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?. It gotta be Tums the Ex-lax is gone. Yeah I took 'em all down with some parmesian. And I think my arm is gone. Yo, it's probably numb. Dumb dumb and fulla cum. And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue. You scary ass it was a false alarm. You think I'm about to die when I just got on?. So stop acting stupid. You so high that you might wake up with a guy. on some new shit (piiills). I think I did too much. I think I got the runs. Rolaids, Pepto, and Tums. Watch out HERE IT COMES!. Chorus: Eminem. [Hook]. Dirty Dozen. 80 of us. Shady brothers. Ladies love us. That's why our baby mothers. Love us but they hate each other. They probably wanna take each other out. And date each other. Some-, something, something, something. Something, something, something, something. [Proof]. Hop pills. Hills I hop. Hop 2 pills. On stilts I walk. Snort two lines that were filled with chalk. Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk. I wanna roll away. Like a rollerblade. Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days. And when I'm old and gray. I'm a go for broke. No oki dok. Pack up my nose with soap. *cough cough cough*. Am I supposed to choke?. Had an accident when the Trojan broke. Ahh, poor baby. Born by whore lady. Now I'm payin' child support. (It's your baby). [Swifty]. I take four shots at one time. And I don't need a chase when I'm swallowing mine. You got any room. In Bizarre's hatch back. We can't go far. Cuz the car has flats. Why the hell you people think I rap?. Because my mother taught me. How to breach contracts. And if you got cash. Then hide it soon. (Swift, chill). I'm just tryin' to get by like you. And I don't give a damn if you find me rude. mean, crude, the hell with you too. I only need three blunts then I'm cool. I just got some and I'm going back soon. Chorus: Eminem. [Bizarre]. I'm at rave. Looking at a babe. Like she want it. Gin and tonic demonic. Body smelt like vomit. Looney, crazy, chubby, sexy, dopey headed guy. Whipped cream, dirty mattresses. Wanna try?. Blue hills, golden seals. Got Bizarre actin' ill. Drugs kill (yeah right). Chick I'm for real. Shut your mouth you dirty girl. You know you want me in your world. Ladies, please don't fight. Bizarre's here all night!!!. Chorus:. [Hook]. Dirty Dozen. 80 of us. Shady brothers. Ladies love us. That's why our baby mothers. Love us but they hate each other. They probably wanna take each other out. And date each other. Some-, something, something, something.

quitter,"[Eminem]. Yo.. I dedicate to this.. to yo... {*imitating Slick Rick*}. To all my fans, keepin y'all in health. Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself. Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin. which I create, cause that's my mission. So listen close, to what we say. because this type of fag claims to never be gay, I... {*rapping normally*}. .. knew you was jealous from the day that I met you. I upset you, cause I get respect I pet you (boy). I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew (c'mon!). And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you. Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood. No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods. Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his. blood. and said, ""Heck, country western rap records are good!!"". So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes. He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both (haha). Puts an album out and rules for part of the year. then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come. from. out of nowhere. It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year. No one's tryin to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair. sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear. So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an. idea. Figure you can diss me to jump start your career. I punch you in your fuckin chest 'til your heart kicks in gear (bitch). And fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew. Like I'ma say they. names. so they can be famous too. [Chorus 2X: Eminem *sung*]. You just a.. quitter, and you bitter cause I came along. and the days of House of Pain are gone. And if you talk about my little girl in a song again. I'ma kill you (I'ma kill you). [Eminem]. Yo.. heart attack to stroke. from. the crack you smoke. to the rap you wrote, your fuckin answer back's a joke. And I'ma tell these motherfuckin fans the truth. The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you. You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you. like I ain't notice you? BITCH, I had a show to do!. Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you. You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two. Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you. Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you. Took your motherfuckin DJ and stole him too. So you fall in a slump and get all emotional. So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings. Confused as fuck cause now your. music. sucks dick. Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap. quicker but never last, and Everlast is a... [Chorus]. Aight listen (look). So this is what we ask of our fans. If you ever see Everlast, WHOOP HIS ASS. Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him. Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him. Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp. Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid. Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it. He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin!. Shit in five years we'll all be ""Eating at Whitey's"". And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets. Aiyyo.. fuck this, cut this shit off. {*music stops*}. Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker!. {*beat changes to 2Pac's ""Hit 'Em Up""*}. Kill Whitey! - Hahaha. Kill Whitey! - Detroit! What? What?. Kill Whitey! - .. yo, yo. Kill Whitey! - Haha! Look. First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say. Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay. You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White. So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight. Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip. Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead. I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath. Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest. Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya. with your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released. Evidence, don't fuck around with. real. MC's. who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks. I let you faggots know it's on for life. but Everlast might die tonight, haha. Fat boy murdered on wax and killed. Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know!. [Chorus: Eminem]. Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady. Call the doctor to heal your heart. They shocked you back to life at the clinic. but you 'bout to get relapsed any minute. Honkey, I hit 'em up!. Hahaha, yo. check. this out. You faggots ain't even on my level. I'ma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots!. [Kon Artis]. Yo! Get out the way yo, get out the way yo. Whitey Ford's heart just stopped. Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack. Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back. Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are. At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya. Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops. Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch. [Kuniva]. Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik. Where's your House of Pain now? There's only one of you Erik. You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round. with some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still. this ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed. with his chest open. Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin. Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime. cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme. Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me. You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me. I'm a paleface killer whale. on his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha. Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?. That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha. Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop. Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop. while my. sales. makin records break. Two and a half million scanned by the second week. Motherfucker I hit 'em up!. [Proof]. I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half. Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags. Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated. Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you. Iriscience get choked up and yoked up. All you underground bitches get your throats cut. [Swifty]. What the fuck?! Is you stupid?. I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord. and. stuff. him in cardboard, chopped up in a box. with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart. D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch. Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door. Cause we ""Hit 'Em Up"" like motherfuckin Tupac Shakur. [Eminem]. You a, ""Black Jesus,"" heart attack seizures. Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases. White devil, washed up honkey. Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country. {*laughing*}. Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off. {*needle drags, beat stops*}. Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise. I just believe in kickin a man while he's down. God damn! I quit. Mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin punk."

rain man,"Yeah. Definitely, definitely. Definitely dawg. Definitely, definitely K-Mart. Yeah, yeah. You find me offensive? I find you offensive. for finding me offensive. Hence if I should draw a line on any fences. If so to what extense if. Any, should I go?. 'Cause it's getting expensive. Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive. They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage. to the brain when I go to lengths this. Far at other people's expenses. I say you're all just too God damn sensitive, it's censorship. And it's down right blasphemous. Listen to shit now 'cause I won't stand for this. And Chirs-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither. And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either. He used to be like a hero to me. I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my re-frigerator. Right next to Darth Vader. And Darth musta put a hex on him for later. I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that. I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther. I killed Superman, I killed Super-man. And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy. Kryptonite, the green chronic. CHORUS. 'Cause I ain't got no legs, or no brain. Nice to meet you. Hi, my name is.... I forgot my name!. My name was not to become. what I became with this level of fame. My soul is possessed by this devil. My new name is.... Rain Man. Now in the Bible it says. Thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed. Have homosexual sex. Unless of course you were given the consent to join in. Then of course, it's intercourse. And it's bi-sexual sex. Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions. Either before, during or after performing the act of that which. Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases. That are more used by today's kids. In a more derogatory way but. Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?. Let's ask Dr. Dre. Dr. Dre? (What up?). I gotta question if I may? (Yeah). Is it gay, to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah). And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah). But, but I ain't done yet. In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt. While he reaches in another grown man's ass. Grabs on his nuts but just what if. It was never meant it was just an accident. But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in. His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it. But his little weenie flinched just a little bit. And I don't mean to go in into anymore details but. What if he pictured it as a females butt?. Is that gay? I just need to clear things up. Till then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because.... Chorus. You find me offensive? I find you offensive. Shit, this is the same verse I just did this. When am I gonna come to my good senses?. Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses. My spider senses telling me Spiderman is nearby. And my plan is to get him next. And open up a whip ass canister. God damn it Dre where is the God damn beat? (Yeah). Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it. This is the only thing that I'm good at. I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic. Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it. I got it, high five Nick Lachey. Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away. And she blew around the room like a balloon-a. Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can and screw my. Head is straight back to the Neverland Ranch. With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich. And I don't gotta make no God damn sense. I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit. Chorus. 'Cause Iahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Yo, Rain Man. Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre. Super dope, beat maker, two thousand and. Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million. Nine hundred and sev' seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three. And seventy (Yeah). By Marcella"

rap god,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you. And not to hurt your feelings. But I'm only going to get this one chance. Something's wrong, I can feel it. Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen. But I don't know what. If that means, what I think it means. We're in trouble, big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say. I'm not taking any chances. You were just what the doctor ordered. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks their arms. Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?. They said I rap like a robot. So call me Rapbot. But for me to rap like a computer. Must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen'll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a living and a killing off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack. I'm an Mc still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with). This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop. You don't really wanna get into a pissing match. With this rappidy rap. Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac. Pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac. And at the exact same time. I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts. While I'm practicing that. I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic. I was under Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow?. All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are having a rough time period. Here's a maxipad. It's actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks their arms. Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?. Let me show you maintaining. This shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key. And the secret to rap immortality like I have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage. And youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the moon since. Mc's get taken to school with this music. Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme. Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2pac N. W. A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy. Thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up. Blow up and be in a position. To meet Run Dmc and induct them. Into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I walk in the church. And burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it's all a game. 'Til I walk a flock of flames. Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?. Little gay looking boy. So gay I can barely say it. With a straight face looking boy. You witnessing a massacre. Like you watching a church gathering. Take place looking boy. Oy vey, that boy's gay. That's all they say looking boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a way to go from your label everyday. Looking boy. Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?. I got a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy. I'mma work for everything I have. Never ask nobody for shit. Get outta my face looking boy. Basically boy you're never gonna be capable. To keep up with the same pace looking boy. I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I'm racing around the track. Call me Nascar, Nascar. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park. The White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton. No Asgard, Asgard. So you be Thor and I'll be Odin. You rodent, I'm omnipotent. Let off then I'm reloading immediately. With these bombs I'm totin'. And I should not be woken. I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head. A zombie floating. But I got your mom deep throating. I'm out my ramen noodle. We have nothing in common, poodle. I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm. And pay homage, pupil. It's me, my honesty's brutal. But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere. In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle. Enough rhymes to maybe to try. And help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case. 'Cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry looking at me. Like it's lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big. And here they come trying to censor you. Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"". From the Marshall Mathers Lp. One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine. Put 'em all in a line, add an Ak-47, a revolver and a nine. See if I get away with it now. That I ain't as big as I was. But I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal. You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though. And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows. You're like normal, fuck being normal. And I just bought a new Raygun from the future. To just come and shoot ya like. When Fabolous made Ray J mad. Cause Fab said he looked like a fag. At Maywhether's pad. Singin' to a man while they played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24 7 special. On the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day. ''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''. Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed. (Jj Fad). Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa. You assuming I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you. I'm superhuman. Innovative and I'm made of rubber. So that anything you saying. Ricocheting off of me. And it'll glue to you. I'm never stating. More than never demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience. A feeling like it's levitating. Never fading. And I know that the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off. They'd be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. Oh, he's too mainstream. Well, that's what they do. When they get jealous, they confuse it. It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it. I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use. Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm ripping any one of these verses. Diverse as you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to prove. That if you're half as nice at songs. You can sacrifice virgins too. School flunkie, pill junky. But look at the accolades the skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself cause I make me do. What I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues. But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel. I'm asleep in the front seat. Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still ""Chunky, But Funky"". But in my head there's something. I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils. Here's what they want from me. They asking me to eliminate. Some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration. The bitter hatred that I had. Then you may be a little patient. And more symphatetic to the situation. And understand the discrimation. But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then. But if I can't batter the women how the fuck. Am I supposed to bake them a cake then?. Don't mistake it for Satan. It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas. And take a vacation to trip a broad. And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard. Be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a God?"
rap superstar,"(Eminem Speaking). Most people don't see how much work is really involved. in this rap shit. I didn't know it. I didn't see it. I never saw it until i was actually in it. You really gotta be in it. To understand what its like. But you always gotta. People always gotta see your smile. You always gotta put on that fake. You know what i'm sayin. No matter what u just been through. (B-Real). So you wanna be a rap superstar. And live large a big house. 5 cars, you're in charge. Comin up in the world. Don't trust nobody. Gotta look over your shoulder constantly. (B-Real). I remember the days when i was a young kid growin up. Lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up. To rock crowds make money. Chill wit the honies. Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me. Shits funny. How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin with it. Never the less you gotta go for the gusto. But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears. and losin some of your peers. And losin some of your self. Music has past gone by. Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy. Egomaniac in the brainiac. Don't know how to act. Shits deep. 48 tracks. Studio gangsta mack. Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill. But never will. Till he crosses over still. Feelin no hate. But fantasies come wit these. Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese. You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz. And take shit from people who don't know what it is. I wish it was all fun and games. But the price of fame is high. And some can't pay to play. Trapped in what you rappin about. Tell me what happened when you lost clout. The rout you took started collapsing. No fans. No fame. No respect. No change. No women. And everyone shits on your name. (Chorus). So you wanna be a rap superstar. And live large. A big house. 5 cars. The rent charged. Comin up in the world don't trust nobody. Gotta look over your shoulder constantly. To be a rap superstar. And live large. A big house. 5 cars. The rent charged. Comin up in the world don't trust nobody. Gotta look over your shoulder constantly. (Noreaga Speaking). When you sign to a record label. You don't know you sign your life over. And these Witheboys don't care about you. Cuz the minute you fall off. They'll find another Noreaga. And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga. And they'll find another B-Real. So you need to just keep. Stack your chips up. Do what you gotta do while your hot. And mafuckin get out the game. Stick to the drug game. And the drug game is even worse. Because if someone jerks you. You can shoot em and kill me. But in this game if someone jerks you. You gotta be humble. (Eminem Speaking). No matter what you just been through. Shit has gotta be right. You gotta approach people. You gotta be on the up and up. And everything gotta be all good. When you see someone slap hands with em. You know what i'm sayin give em a pound. Or whatever it is. But you always gotta act like it ain't shit. (Chorus). (B-Real). My own son don't know me. Sittin up in the hotel room lonley. But I thank god I'm wit my homies. But sometimes I wish I was back home. But only no radio or videos. Cuz they show me no love. The phony gotta hit the road slowly. So the record gets pushed by sony. I'm in the middle like monie. And the press say that. My own people disowned me. And the best way back. Is to keep your head straight. Never inflate the cranium. Your crew worried about them honies at the paladium. Who just wanna cling on swing on. And so on and go on and fall off. The hoes fall off. To the next rap superstar. Wit no shame give him a year. And they'll be right out the game. The same as the last one. Who came before him. Gained fame. Started gettin ignored. I warned him. Assured him. This ain't easy take it from weezy. Sleezy people wanna be cheesey. They talkin evil."

I spot you at first glance and go, ""shit"". You wearin' those pants that don't fit. That butt won't ever give up. That's why you stick it out no matter what. 'Cause you got an ass that won't quit. So, get on the horn, my saxophone. Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow. You just laugh and go heehee. 'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate. That's why.

If you're thinking that mi casa es su casa. Yeah, you're a cute fox. Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk. Girl, you're smoking like Snoop Dogg. But you must be Token if you think you're taking over my quarters. There goes the dime into the jukebox. Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll. Turn this brouha to a barroom brawl. So hit scratch on the break like the cue ball. Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox. And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw. But apparently, so are you, ma.

renegade,"[Jay-Z]. Motherfuckers -. say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling). Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim. through it?. See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined. That same dude you gave nothin, I made somethin doin. what I do through and through and. I give you the news - with a twist it's just his. ghetto point-of-view. The renegade; you been afraid. I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the. block where they. pop toasters, and they live with they moms. Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz. crotched over. Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over. Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked. No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it. down. I bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round. hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck. in they ways. Just read a magazine that fucked up my day. How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to. it?. I help them see they way through it - not you. Can't step in my pants. Can't walk in my shoes. Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your. shirt. [Eminem]. Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they. listen. I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a. minute. Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits. I'll wear it. But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin. and bear it. Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative. lyrics. Who could inherit the title, put the youth in. hysterics. Usin his music to steer it, sharin his views and his. merits. But there's a huge interference - they're sayin you. shouldn't hear it. Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the. spirit. Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just. cherish. But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America. as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't. experiment?. Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in. the mirror. and see yourself as a kid again, and you get. embarrased. And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as. parents. You fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good. at marriage!. (Ha ha!) And do you have any clue what I had to do to. get here I don't. think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to. the stereo. Cause here we go - he's {*Jigga joint. Jigga-chk-Jigga*}. And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the. [Chorus: Eminem + Jay-Z]. [Em] Renegade! Never been afraid to say. what's on my mind at, any given time of day. Cause I'm a Renegade! Never been afraid to talk. about anything (Anything) anything (Anything),. Renegade!. [Jay] Never been afraid to say. what's on my mind at, any given time of day. Cause I'm a {Renegade} Never been afraid to holler. about anything {anything?} Anything {Anything!}. [Jay-Z]. I had to hustle, my back to the wall,. Ashy knuckles. Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent. Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the. project bench. Whatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in. By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin braver. Doo-rag wrappin my waves up,. Pockets full of hope. Do not step to me - I'm awkward,. I box leftier often. My pops left me an orphan,. My momma wasn't home. Could not stress to me I wasn't grown;. 'Specially on nights. I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings. My demeanor - thirty years my senior. My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up. Raisin my fingers to critics;. Raisin my head to the sky. Big I did it - multi before I die (nigga). No lie, just know I chose my own fate. I drove by the fork in the road and went straight. [Eminem]. See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day. Shakespeare. Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here. To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint. me. As a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist. But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste. We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he. is. Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?. Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today. See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie. while I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against. me. Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the. Catholics. in holy water - no wonder they try to. Hold me under longer. I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, Delightful eyeful. The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers Hate to like you. What did I do? (huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter. makin this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a. muh'fuckin. [Chorus: Eminem + Jay-Z]"

It feels like it'll take a century to heal, but just know that I will. But fuck trying to make amends. I'd rather take revenge. You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium. your day begins at 8pm. You hit the Atm in my Mercedes Benz. with all your lady friends. Whores hit the club and you go out don't know a sum. 'Cause when I calculate the times. you cheated and total up all the amounts. It doesn't add up. 'cause you say that just giving out your number. doesn't count. Then see me with someone new get mad and flip it. look bad you spin it. First you turn your back on me then tell me. that I stabbed you in it. Stabbed you in it slut so when you're driving. driving to his house. And you pass me while I'm driving to hers, just remember. You cheated on me first. You're a whore, you're a whore this is war. We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge. Together, together, together. We could take revenge, revenge, revenge. Revenge is sweet. We could do revenge revenge, revenge, revenge. Together, together, together. We could take revenge, revenge, revenge. Revenge is sweet"
revival (interlude) (feat. alice and the glass lake),"I've drowned in high from the ashes, now. I can't recall your laughter. The smoke of everything, go grasp at ends. Of what's left over. And the lights in every broken. Blown out window screaming, laughing. I hope to feel it coursing out. This is our revival"
rhyme or reason,"Yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah. (What's your name?) Marshall. (Who's your daddy?) I don't have one. My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon. And had me on the back of a motorcycle. Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap. I'm loco. It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun. Michelangelo with a paint gun. In a tantrum. Bout to explode all over the canvas. Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm. Your music usually has them. But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't. Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan. A Jedi in training, colossal brain. And, thoughts are entertainin'. But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and. Probably find a way to complain. About a Picasso painting. Puke Skywalker, but sound like. Chewbacca when I talk. Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog. Can't even find the page. I was writing this rhyme on. Oh it's on a rampage, couldn't see. What I wrote I write small. It says ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls. Had a fire in my heart. And a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard. So as long as I'm on the clock. Punching this time card. Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch. But sometimes, when I'm sleepin'. She comes to me in my dreams. Is she taken, is she mine?. Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give. Let me take you by the hand to, promise land. And threaten everyone. 'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing. (What's your name?) Marshall. (Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder. (Is he rich like me?) Ha. (Has he taken, any time. To show you what you need to live?). No, if he had, he wouldn't have ended up. In these rhymes on my pad. I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad. Yeah Dad. I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens. When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands. And makes you want to get up. And start dancin', even if it is Charles Manson. Who just happens, to be rapping, blue lights flashing. Laughing all the way to the bank. Lamping in my K-Mart mansion. I'm in the style department. With a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart with. Great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content. Completely, despondent and condescending. The king of nonsense. And controversy is on a, beat killing spree. Your honor, I must plead guilty. 'Cause I sparked a, revolution, rebel without a cause. Who caused the evolution of rap. To take it to the next level, boost it. But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it. (Hip-hop is the devil's music) Is that me. It belongs to me?. Cause I just happen to be. A White honky devil with two horns. That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep. But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper. Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, cause it's the. It's the time of the season, when hate runs high. And this time, give it to you easy. When I take back what's mine with pleasured hands. And torture everyone, that is my plan. My job here isn't done. Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing. (What's your name?) Shady. (Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder. (Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha. (Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?). So yeah, Dad let's walk, let's have us a father and son talk. But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block. Without me knockin' your block off. This is all your fault. Maybe that's why I'm so bananas. I appeal to all those walks of life. Whoever had strife. Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like. Cause I, related to the struggles of young America. When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles. Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again. It's hysterical. I chuckle, 'cause everybody. Bloodies their bare knuckles, yeah uh-oh. Better beware knuckleheads. The sign of my hustle says don't knock. The doors broken, it won't lock. It might just fly open, get cold cocked. You critics come to pay me a visit. Misery loves company, please stay a minute. Kryptonite to a hypocrite. Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it. Too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks. Then you wonder why I lash out. Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers. So spread the word. 'Cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out. Completely brain dead Rainman. Going a bankhead in a restraint chair. So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare. Or get shanked in the pancreas. I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer. Put together with Chief Keef. Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah. Even this rhyme, bitch. And quit tryna look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there. But I still am a CRIMINAL. Ten-year-old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS. The last Mathers LP that went diamond. This time I'm predicting this one will go EMERALD. When will the madness end. How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen. The only message that I have to send is. Dad, I'm back at it again, yeah"
rhymin' wordz freestyle,"First word, excrimate. Exclimate, is that what you said?. My next defense, against these extra men. Who try to step to me and wanna have sex again. (Vaseline).

Stretch Armstrong, my brother, coming with rhymes every time that I be drumming. Running with this shit when I kick MCâ€™s in the stomach. And star wars, this carâ€™s a Taurus.

Thereâ€™s mayonnaise on this, I need a plain sandwich. Hurry up, give me one, rappers wanna step to this, they give me none. (Fresh vegetables). With fresh vegetables, my testicles are hanging off to the left of you. Youâ€™re bisexual, and thereâ€™s a guy next to you, standing, rappers know that I. be-. (Preparation H). Preparation H, you didnâ€™t even let me finish my rhyme. Just shut up for one more time, while I just jime, on this. Microphone, cause Iâ€™ma be honest, any MC who tries to step to this. Iâ€™m making you a promise, that what? Give me a word. (Nostradamus). That Nostradamus is blowing up your house, killing your foster mammas. And coming back to get your parents, well I have it. These rhymes are fourteen karat, solid gold. Rappers step to me, you get your wallet stole. (Times Square). In Times Square, I got blond hair, Iâ€™m higher than con air. Rappers donâ€™t want to see me, Iâ€™ll butt fuck Goldie Hawn bare. In a lawn chair, cause Iâ€™m there. (Kurt Russell). With Kurt Russell, saying â€œcome here Goldie, you want my love muscle?â€. I know you want it, I get plunted(?), then I. Kick these, freestyles just like whipped knees. (Taxicab). With a taxicab, Iâ€™ll smack a bitch with a maxi pad. Where we going? Donâ€™t ask me dad. Leave me alone, Iâ€™m not trying, to even hear you. Dad, I hope youâ€™re fucking dying, off this porno mag. Yo, did you see my ad? Yo, wait a minute, did you see my ass?. Is what I meant to say, I meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary. For the century, Slim Shadyâ€™s is gonna be the illest. (Flamingos). What? Flamingos? My mother goes out and plays bingo. Every single day, at the bingo hall, thatâ€™s why my dick is single, small. Didnâ€™t blow up, just donâ€™t give a what? A cuff?.

ricky ticky toc,"Once you call my name out things will never be the same. They should have never let us get off foot in this game. Ever since I was introduced to rap music. I been missin' a screw like Bishop and Juice. I could lose it at any moment. Those who know me know it. So they probably told you go with the flow just so that, I don't explode and. have another episode where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did. I'm waitin' for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded. I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin' bananas. My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fuckin' pole vault with. Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated. Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it. Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name it's a game. 'Cause they know that they don't spit the same. It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame. Everyday it's the same thing. People in this game try to buddy buddy us. Just to get close enough to study us. Everybody just wants to have somethin' to do with that. They all tryin' to get that stamp. They after that Shady/Aftermath money. It's like a monopoly. They probably just now finally understand how to rob fully. 50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me. And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin' lottery. And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other. Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers. When we rhyme with each other. In time we discovered that we have more in common. then we thought with each other. Both robbed of our mothers. Our fathers ain't want us. What was wrong with us, was it our fault. 'cause we started thinkin' God doesn't love us. Two odd motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time. What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens. I still remember the call up in ??? 'cause. Big L had just got popped just a month before. If 50 lives he's gettin' dropped from Columbia. Two years later me and Doc had to come and ah, operate. That's when he popped up a number one. And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin'. Even if I'm under the gun. You ain't gotta agree all the time with me or see eye to eye. There'll always be animosity between you and I. But see the difference is, if it is I could give a shit. Still gonna conduct motherfuckin' business as usual. Ego's aside, 'fore I bruise 'em all. Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it wit' shoes you call Nike's. Earth links , how do you like these?. You gotta love them, look at the bottom of 'em they're like cleats. Stompin', I been rompin' since Tim Dogg was, hollerin' ""Fuck Compton"". I was whilin', freestylin', back when, they was still makin', Maxell cassettes. It wasn't even raps Elvis yet. That tells us that, any doubts in your head that seals the shit. Ricky-Ticky-Toc-Ticky-Ticky-Toc. Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc. And you don't stop. By: BuNNy_SsHady*"
ridaz,"Aw man, yea. You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight. And people that you don't even know jump in?. You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, your pissed. You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this You're bout to get the shit pushed in, I'm just inches away. I'm splitting your shit wide open, no stitches could save. So die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way. You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid. Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say isn't this great. On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate. They're starting to take place in the middle of the street. Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat. Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene, but it is too late. It's absolute pandemonium, you whisked away. In a ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you when you left your house today coulda made you anticipate. Such an ass whooping, okay, til the anger dissipates. You get punched in the face, reciprocate. So what the deal, ridaz?. Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?. My balls are feeling a-mighty big now. I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches. I said.... So what the deal, ridaz?. Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?. My balls are feeling a-mighty big now. I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches. You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case. Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies. You better go get your mace cuz shady said so. You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face. That's how fucking rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?. If you don't wanna get the shit beat outta you, chill. Cuz if you doubt me you will, yea got me a pill, found me a thrill. I got a couple of drinks here and I'm bound to refill. Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?. This cocksucker did not spill my drink, Oh HELL no. He must be tryna kill my buzz, I will not budge. And what the deal ridaz?. Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat. That's probably a record yea, you wasn't expecting that. Cuz they want in on the act, there's a cognac-. Bottle, we snuck it in cuz the beer that they were serving here was only tap. I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts. You're frightened like this guy might hurt me. You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder. Play smarter, you may start a rope but you need a chainsaw to. Dig your way out of, go powder your nose-. Pussy the louder you yell, the harder I slap the shit out of you hoes. You set it off faggot, so now how do you spose-. We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes. So what the deal, ridaz?. Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?. My balls are feeling a-mighty big now. I might just have to dig down and pull em through my. britches. I said.... So what the deal, ridaz?. Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?. My balls are feeling a-mighty big now. I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches. It's shear hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles. We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us. And adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing. Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe. And nothing my signatures, ligature marks. Look at you all big with your remarks, and I swing an icepick at your heart. At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart. And dig at you and break you down like the bitch that you are. The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car. The pain inflicted upon you, it's so sick, it's bizarre. Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far. As having me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments ARGH!. You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails, for that-. You catch an open-hand slap, break off your nail like BAP!. In fact, I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves. Where's D12, I don't feel like doing this by myself. So what the deal, ridaz?. Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?. My balls are feeling a-mighty big now. I might just have to dig down and pull em through my. britches. I said.... So what the deal, ridaz?. Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?. My balls are feeling a-mighty big now. I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches"
right for me,"I feel phenomenal as usual. Pharmaceuticals, glue sniff and pools of vomit at Bonnaroo. But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston. In the corner trying to seek solitude. Shallow but such a hollow dude. I won't even swallow solid food. Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa. Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you. Roses are violet, mollies are blue. Lost in a ball of confusion. Its all an illusion. It's probably the shrooms I'm on. Cause I think I started hallucinating. Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica. And Odd Future's new shit. And all I can do is follow the music. And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza. Fillin' water balloons with nail polish remover. Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes. I feel uptight I gotta get looser. After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution. Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted. Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit. Excusez-moi but that coochie that passed. You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze. But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer. It's mouth waterin' too so I walked up to it like I'm Marshall. Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll Introduce ya. Oh I'm a misogynist too but I'm not a masseuse. But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth. A chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana. I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers. Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, and a nuke. And a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood so. When I say I'm bringing the TEC out. I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers. God, I'm gonna puke. I'm so gone off the hookah. I think I swallowed a loofah. I'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like Oliver. Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her. The thoughts I produce are loony tunes. The box of usable latex gloves. And the socks and the shoes. To replace next up Veronica's boobs. And uhh, paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box. In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues. The girl was just not the one suitable for or. Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be. Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen. Don't laugh, please listen. Thought I'd give in to the pressure. Collapse and crumble perhaps. Relapsing under that. Well that's a bunch of crap. In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap. And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that. Fuck that shit, cut the sack. Like its a natural reaction. That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match. Cause push keeps coming to that. I can keep getting my ass kicked, I? m coming back. Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad. Disgruntled had some struggles yeah. But that passionate hunger's back. The fantastic juggling act. And the way I flip my tongue on the track. It's like verbal acrobatics. But in fact. Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic. I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft. After I strapped the duffel bag to my back. And stuck the massive punchin' bag in it. An elastic bungee strap, proper plaster, a thumb tack. And a piece of plastic bubble wrap. Went spastic and fuckin' snapped. Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid. Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped. And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat. And for my last trick, lunge on back lash. On a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half. Chuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal. And just asked him to come crash. And I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic. Humongous mattress. And ceramic construction hat. Rubbed my magic mushroom tat. Fell off then splat, get up from that. Face taped to a waste paper basket. Throw up then gas, lungs collapse. And that's more likely than finding someone that's. Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be. Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen. Don't laugh, please listen. Couple of shots of Jäger. Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation. Flooded with thoughts of anger. While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'. ""You're top ten ain't cha?. ""stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy. And stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation. Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous. Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is. I came to fuck with your occupation. You're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs. And you brought the scalpel and sponge. The oxygen tank and the suction. And shot the brain surgeon. Stuck in the operating room. Once you done swapped your name with him. Smuggled in Ronald Reagan. Dug him up; Donald Fagen. While juggling waffles baking. Fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle. They flung it across the table. Then bump it and knock it shake it. Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration. I said fuck it and lost my patience. They all woke up from sedation. Ain't none of you Doctor Dre. So then what does it got you thinkin'. You can fuck with this operation. Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing. I'm still pluggin' along. No need for an assumption. Here's confirmation. I'm up for the long duration. I'm just looking for something to walk away with. Some pocket change and a little integrity. Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage. Till I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and. Stuck in an awkward place in my life. But I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation. That day will come before. I finally stumble upon some lady that's. Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be. Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen. Don't laugh, please listen"
river (feat. ed sheeran),"I've been a liar, been a thief. Been a lover, been a cheat. All my sins need holy water. Feel it washing over me. Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something. If all it's gonna cause is pain. Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain. So let the river run. He's coming home with his neck scratched. To catch flack. Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch. On his breast jacket's a sex addict. And she just wants to exact revenge and get back. It's a chess match, she's on his back. Like a jet pack. She's kept track of all his internet chats. And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?. Actually, just shit on my last chick. And she has what my ex lacks. 'Cause she loves danger, psychopath. And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that. But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back. Knife-in-hand scissor relationships hanging by a strand. So she's been on the web lately. Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man. And I know she's using me to try to play him. I don't care, hi Susan, but I shoulda said ""Bye Susan"". After the first night, but tonight I am. I've been a liar, been a thief. Been a lover, been a cheat. All my sins need holy water.

One-night stand. Turned in two-night stand. He was calling so might scram. Now we hug tight, and. He found out, now she feels deserted and used. 'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too. Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?. It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued. And witnessed you hurt. But what you deserve is the truth. Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you. So I revert to the studio like Hole in the Wall diners. Don't have to be reserved in a booth. I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's. Irreversible, I preyed on you. Like it's church at the pew. And now that I got you I don't want you. Took advantage of my thirst to pursue. Why do I do this dirt that I do?. Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon, and speech. Detergent and bleach is burning the wound. 'Cause now with her in the womb. We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew. To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit... fuck!. I've been a liar, been a thief. Been a lover, been a cheat. All my sins need holy water. Feel it washing over me. Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something. If all it's gonna cause is pain. Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain. So let the river run. My name's (ooh) , my name's (ooh). Denver (ooh) , watch the river run. Call me (ooh) , call me (ooh). River (ooh) , we'll let the river run. Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey! "". Fuck can I say? If life was a highway. The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes. Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe. That's why I made they came at you sideways. I can't keep my lies straight. Well, I made you terminate, my baby. This love triangle, left us in a wreck-tangled. What else can I say? It was fun for a while. Bet I really woulda loved your smile. Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it. What's one more lie. To tell a unborn child?. I've been a liar, been a thief. Been a lover, been a cheat. All my sins need holy water. Feel it washing over me.

rock bottom,"Ah yeah, yo!. This song is dedicated to all the happy people. All the happy people who have real nice lives. And who have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck. Verse One:. I feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net. I'm popping perkasets, I'm a nervous wreck. I deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check. Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt. Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged. Full of venom and rage. Especially when I'm engaged. And my daughter's down to her last diaper. That's got my ass hyper. I pray that god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer. Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders. These overnight stars becoming autograph signers. We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us. Along with the small fry's and average half pinters. While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas. Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us. Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless. Snakes slither in the grass spineless. Chorus: repeat 2X. That's Rock Bottom. When this life makes you mad enough to kill. That's Rock Bottom. When you want something bad enough to steal. That's Rock Bottom. When you feel you have had it up to here. Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear. Verse Two:. My life is full of empty promises. And broken dreams. I'm hoping things will look up. But there ain't no job openings. I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished. Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished. And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay. And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day. But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play. Cause when we die we know were all going the same way. It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan. When all you need is bucks to be the man. Plus a luxury sedan. Too comfortable and roomy in a six. They threw me in the mix. With all these gloomy lunatics. Walk around depressed. And smoke a pound of ses a day. And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today. My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play. Live half my life and throw the rest away. Chorus. There's people that love me and people that hate me. But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady. I want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame. That Means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames. That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name. Lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain. Right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom. I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em. I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em. Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em. My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em. And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em. And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them. I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?. Cause I never went gold of one song. I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn. Chorus"

Doing this shit crazy while half of you amaze me. If this is nonsense to you its because you aint been through. You obviously aint been threw shit. Age 16 started hating everyone and everything cause I relized that. shit doesnt always go my way unless I got money that earns say. While the consequences every year come with fear.

I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this. If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus. I strangled you to death then I choked you again. Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin. You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally. Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally. I get you blunted off of funny home grown. Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono. (Ohh no!!) So if I said I never did drugs. That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does. Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert. I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch!). My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge. Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads (Fuck you!). Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez. Follow me and do exactly what the song says:. smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink. And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal. I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal. So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill. Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin skill. Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill. But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist. How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist. I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave. Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave. My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?. And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?. Now follow me and do exactly what you see. Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!. I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.. Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!. Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole. When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold'. Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold. Killed em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco (we did it!). My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk. I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt. I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer. That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer (psssssssh). My rap style's warped, I'm runnin out the morgue. witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch. Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on. And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn. I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits. A premature birth that was four minutes late. Mother.. are you there? I love you. I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel. Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed. a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?. I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high, or I'm nuts. Cause if you ain't tiltin this room, neither am I. So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass. Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her. Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with. I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it. I came to the club drunk with a fake ID. Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!. I've been with 10 women who got HIV. Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!. I got genital warts and it burns when I pee. Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!. I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree."
run rabbit run,"[Verse 1]. Some days I just wanna up and call it quits. I feel like im surrounded by a wall of bricks. Everytime I go to get up, I just fall in pits. My life's like one great big ball of shit. If I could just put it all in the all I spit. Instead of always trying to swallow it. Instead of staring at this wall and shit. While I sit, writers block, sick of all this shit. Can't call it shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall. If I have to see another one of mom?s alcoholic fits. This is it, last straw, that?s all, that?s it. I ain't dealing with another fuckin' politic. I'm like a skillet bubbling until it filters up. I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up. Blow this building up, I?ve concealed enough. My cup runneth over, I done filled it up,. The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts. You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,. Well I'm-a show you what, you gon' feel my rush,. You don?t feel it, then it must be too real to touch,. Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up. Goosebumps, yeah, I'm-a make your hair sit up. Yeah sit up, I'm-a tell you who I be. I'm-a make you hate me, 'cause you ain't me. You wait, it ain't too late to finally see. What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see. Whoever finds me's gonna get a finders fee. Out this world, ain't no one out they mind as me. You need peace of mind? Here?s a piece of mine. All I need?s a line,. but sometimes I don?t always find the words to rhyme. to express how I'm really feeling at that time, yea. sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. just sometimes, it?s always me. How dark can these hallways be?. The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half past three. This half-assed rhyme, with this half-assed piece of paper,. [Verse 2]. I'm desperate at my desk. If I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest again. Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothing. Fuck I'm stumped, but wait, here comes something. Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad,. crinkle it up and throw the shit out. I'm fizzlin' out, thought I figured it out. ball?s in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out. I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I a slave to this trade?. Sign that I spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up. Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want. I'm-a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter. I'm-a sit it here 'til I get enough of me to finally hit. a fucking boiling point, put some oil on your joints,. flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed,. an emcees worst dream, i make 'em jinx,. they hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence,. by the looks of 'em you would swear that jaws was comin',. by the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone,. by the way they running, you would swear the law was comin',. It's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothing,. Mama, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back,. he pinky promised, I don't think he's honest,. I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock. fuck this clock, I'm-a make 'em eat this watch,. Don't believe me? Watch, I'm-a win this race,. and I'm-a come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch!. I found my niche, you gonna hear my voice,. 'til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice,. if I gotta scream till I have half a lung,. If I had half a chance, i'd grab it,. Rabbit, run!"

Outz in the area tearing things up. [Az-Izz]. Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence. Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence. Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event. Outz in a fear of family presents. Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat. To roast motherfuckers, over lactose. Stay skeed off laced weed. I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks. Rolling box of Tracies. [Pace Won]. Call a go-go dancer. Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer. Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up. Once for my cock, twice for my block,. I got it locked like handcuffs. Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut. Swing a blow you can't duck. Throw up your hands, what?. Nobody on earth could see Pacer. I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer. Chorus. [Slang Ton]. I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie. Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna. And if you ever wanna get a deal. You should either OD off skill pills. Or steal my reel-to-reel. Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when. I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints. Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is. And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges. [Eminem]. I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?). I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha). Right off the top, then go back to the top. And then repeat it (Ha). Write it down on the paper. And still be able to read it (Sorry). I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear). I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!). I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out. I been down with the Outz for ten thou-sand years. ([Pace Won] So dunn, here?). Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear. Lauryn, huh? Hill?. ([Pace won] There's more than one? IIIllll). What? You want me to stop? Here?. Chorus. [Young Zee]. Yea. Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red. Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head. Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs. Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave. Yea, we all of the a volumes. What be the outcome?. We selling twenty million albums. Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that. You fell off, and had to take your five mic. And push a white Ac, with a bike rack. [Axe]. It's the A, the X, the E. Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?. F' with we, what you expect to see. Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace. Bet they find my pistol next to me. My dick is giving ecstasy. Shit I say, spread like leprosy. I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee. Living recklessly, cock the weaponry. Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3. Yo follow, never question me. Chorus. [Pace Won]. C'mon yo. Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?. Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?. Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?. Outz in the area tearing things up. Outworld baby."

say goodbye hollywood,"Say Goodbye Hollywood. Chorus (X2). Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood. Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood. Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood. Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood. Verse 1. I thought I had it all figured out, I did, I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim. but I wasn't tough enough, to juggle two things at once, I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs. which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave. How come I couldn't see this shit myself?. it's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt, knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell. to catch me, the minute shit was heated, she just bailed, I'm standin' here swingin' like thirty people by myself. I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell, turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt. saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground, I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail. I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female, I need to slow down, get my feet on solid ground/so for now I'm.... Chorus (X2). Verse 2. I, bury my face in comic books, cus I don't want to look at nothin', this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could. If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would, and end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood. I probably should, these problems are piling all at once, cus everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up. I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up, I gotta get up, thank God, I got a little girl. and I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good, I'd be to my daughter, layin' in the bottom of the mud. must be in my blood cus I don't know how I do it, all I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps. of my dad, cus I hate him so bad, the worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass. man if you could understand why I am the way that I am, what do I say to my fans/when I tell 'em (I'm).... Chorus (X2). Verse 3. I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it, for me to have this much appeal like this is sick. this is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick, publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick. fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at Gats, if I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whupped some ass. I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact, I've sacrificed everything I have. I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked. everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask, what about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?. It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped. I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back, I just wanna leave this game with level head intact. Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein', everything blow up and all you did was just grow up mcing. It's fuckin' crazy, cus all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had, but instead I forced us to live alienated. so I'm sayin'.... Outro. Goodbye. Goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye). Please don't cry for me (It's been real). When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me). Goodbye. Goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fuckin' star). Please don't cry for me (No way). When I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)."

Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me. I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby. if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me. to do war, and try to bring my crew back down. I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now. I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out. With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now. [Xzibit]. Let's see who got they city on lock. Let's see who got the better aim with the glock. Let's see who come out on top. Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets. Let's see who wanna die the same time as me. and make ends meet. Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?. I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse. And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri. Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now. [Chorus: Nate Dogg]. I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name. Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain. Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same. Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain. Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game. Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain. I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain. Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name. [Xzibit]. Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin. Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me. How can you doubt me?

Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth. Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth. all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony). All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy). Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now. I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile. Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand. They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man. So who the FUCK?! (Who the FUCK?!) you think you talkin to. Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!. [Chorus]. [Eminem]. I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him. Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him. I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him. I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him. purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels. I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you. But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you. I ""Square Dance"" cause I'm sick of rappin circles. around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out. It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow. You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out. You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon.

(Dre) Okay, well let's handle the small shit. Verse 1. (Eminem) I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit/grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit, corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch/thick 'n rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth, Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth/till the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth, and if I fumble a verse, keep going, first take/I make mistakes just keep it, no punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit/fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit, wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit. (Dre) Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane, been here longer than anyone in the game/and I ain't got to lie about my age, ""But what about Jermaine?"" Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name/and don't think I don't read your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin', I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move/till I'm provoked, when I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it/you midget, mini-me with a bunch of mini-yous, runnin' round your backyard swimmin' pools/over eighty million records sold, and I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds. Chorus X2. Cus what you say is what you say, say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it/just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' wit, huh?. Verse 2. (Eminem) Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this, amatuers drink veteran piss/from a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri/we'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain/Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate. (Dre) If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry, that could save it when I'm gone and buried/to make sure the tradition carries on, I would. (Eminem) If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could. (Dre) From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'ma only sting when I cornered. (Eminem) And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning/and swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off, cus I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off/another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk, don't give a fuck, White-Pac, so much spunk/when I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill, or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer. (Dre) And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron, I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again/there's no obstacle that I can't conquer so come along wit us·.Cmon. Chorus X2. Verse 3. (Dre) Now anybody who knows Dre, knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day/but I handled my business, cus it' work before play, don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet/however you want it, you can have it your way, you fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day/bullet with your name, sendin' it your way, that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway/cus this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it, and you'll die tryin' to violate it/fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dialated. (Eminem) Like my old lady?/Cus what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings/think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone/ and I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad. (Dre) And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything/catch a contract on your head, you headed west, talk shit about Dre, you better get a vest/and invest in something to protect your head and neck. (Eminem) And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best, in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest/and if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death/five mics in the Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe/ to collect a fuckin' check. Chorus X2. Outro. (Dre) Watch your fuckin' mouth. (Timbaland) Yo this Timbaland. Tell'em I said suck·my dick"

I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie. I'm free-fallin feet first out of a damn tree. to stampede your chest till you can't breathe. And when I'm down to my last breath.

It's even tougher when sleeping. But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving. For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening. You got my knees buckling and weakening. Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in. And interrupt when I'm speaking. I got some game that I'm preparing to run The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun. You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun. Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun. I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a touch I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good. The seed is passing in dust. I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately. I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me. If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby). Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to beYour man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed. This is easily said, so you can lead or be led. If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found. Chorus:Women Singing:. I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (4X). Verse 2: Denaun Porter. Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo. Let's set a day up so you can fall on through. We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast. Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es. We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne. And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things. I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane. If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that dayIt's still all right cause. I got Minute Maid and Tangeray. Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear. You look impeccable, nothing compares. I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so. It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so. Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is. When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie. Chorus:Women Singing:. I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (8X). Ain't no one special, special like you (2X)."
seduction,"(Intro:). I don't now man, just feels like, well a lot different. Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now. Feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like... it's kinda like. (Verse 1:). I feel like I'm morphin, into something so incredible, that I'm dwarfin'. All competetors, better get your girlfriend in check. It's psychological warfare, endorphin side-effect. Your self esteem shatters his dialect. Comes blasting out your deck, she loves me. So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet. You're strong oh, you're fucking corny, you try to turn your charm on. Cause you just think you're Bishop the don one. But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one. I'm cockin' my head back like 'Ed Lover, come on son. She's on my johnson, she brings my name up constant. Your boys are like ""she's fucking with dude, she wants some"". Homeboy, you better get a clue. She's on my dick cause I spit better than you. What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack. When she's closing her eyes, fantasizing. Of digging her nails in my back to this track. (Hook:). Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do. Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't. She's been stolen from you. Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do. Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't. She's been stolen from you. (Verse 2:). She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar. She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you. Than to count the things that are. There's a seven disc, CD changer in her car. And I'm in every single slot, and you're not, aw. I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star. And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah. Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up. Cause they're just not good enough. But I'm not giving up til I get my respect. And I won't stop til I get enough. Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations, aw. That hater alarm is sounding off. And Obama took the bomb from my name, aw. So quit crying that I took your dame. Homie she's my dame, aw. You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game boy. And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came for it. You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy. But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?. It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault. Man I can't call it. (Hook:). Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do. Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't. She's been stolen from you. Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do. Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't. She's been stolen from you. (Verse 3:). It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear. You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker. Dear, while I freak this world premier. Seducing her, loosen up with a little freestyle. Wait, am I losing ya? Am I making you look bad?. Well I got news for ya homie, you're losing her. Oh wait she don't like when I spit it fast. Am I tryna show how, let me slow it down. It's still gonna be a blowout. You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album. Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something. To see if you can save any of it punk. But none of it's fucking with me. Prick you really feeling that bullshit?. You think you killing them syllables? quit playing. These beats ain't nothing to fool with. They call me fire Marshall, I shut the shit down. Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round. I am also the opposite of what you are like. You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic. I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck. She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck. From sucking my dick, awwfuck. (Hook:). Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do. Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't. She's been stolen from you. Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do. Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't. She's been stolen from you"
session one (feat. slaughterhouse),"[Intro]. Ladies and gentlemen. Make some noise. Aw shit. Yeah. Y'all ready to get this shit started or what. Alright. Well I brought some friends with me too. [Verse 1 - Eminem]. Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back. I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks. Couple Xanax light a couple wax candles then black out. And relapse till I yack Jack Daniels and yap. Burp bubbles, attitudes Immaturing. Double shot of bacardi, party. Vision is blurring, woh ho. I can't see shit. My words get to slurring uh oh. You can call me R Kelly now or you're in trouble. What's incurring before after enduring the show. Has no baring on the bad news I'm baring whoa. what is it word play?. No I'm pushing you out the dumps. So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow. Now stomp your fucking feet till you get to squishing a hoe. It's pandemo-nium standin' oh when you see him oh. Damn baby you look good you're giving me wood. You should pull over like a sweat shirt with a hood. Snap work a napoleon you and me both. Break bread while I'm coppin' over this game now pinch a loaf. Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass. Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me. I'm Kanye when he crashed. In other words I got the hood on smash. Like I stepped on the gas destroyed the front end. Deployed the damn airbags from the dash. Went through 'em and laughed. Came back an hour after the accident. And bit a goddamn jaw-breaker in half. So stop taping the funk and start shaking ya ass. Slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian the rap. Just Blaze on the track. What the f-ck is more amazing than that slut. Answer me that, Royce where you at?. [Verse 2 - Royce D' 5'9""]. I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers. Are prying you apart tune-up on your head designed by a bar-stool. Designed by a cartoon, before I need to be hired. Jimmy 'Io fire Marshall. The 9 tucked against the lining. I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down. Like ya'll are a couple 69ing. It's like Rick James is shooting up your house n-gga. F-ck your couch n-gga. You screaming f-ck the world with your middle finger up. While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud. My b-tch, know I'm perfectly fit for murder. Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel the Oj the Glove. I got a Posse of Insane Clowns. Blow your brains on your opposite ear. Then ask you how your brain sounds. Bad, evil, weirdo, Alfred Ego, mad cerebral, you on your last burrito. (What that mean Nickel?). It's a rap if you eating, get a beat then terrorize that b-tch like I'm Middle Eastern. Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touchin' that. Good day and good night, Ortiz where the fuck you at?. [Verse 3 - Joel Ortiz]. I'm right here my Nike Airs buzz light-years ahead of my mic peers. Quite scary to look at, a nightmare, where my book at I'll write fear. In the heart of you tight squares, I harbor the art of you night square. It's tight ware 'cause that made me hotter than my dear. Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his 9th beer. Homie chill listen, I swear, I'm God, I give tracks a holy feel. And they bite ears. I'm right here, why wouldn't I be, just waiting to be hooked to Ivs. Monroe's brown when you look at my pee. And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction, and record the pig's oink. When I rip his intestines. This isn't just an infection. This won't go away with penicillin injections. Millions of questions arouse after they did an inspection. What I exhibit, seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it. Aw shit I did it again, when I lit with this pen, I admitted this phlegm. This time along side Em and the Em. So tell a friend to tell a friend, write a disgusting hook. Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the f-ck is Crook?. [Verse 4 - Crooked I]. I'm right here letting the shotty pop. Quick as a karate chop, get your body shot, get your top chopped like a lollipop. Come with Maserati drop in the body shot. Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped. I take your life to the 9th inning. A knife in a gunfight I love it me and my knife winnin'. I laugh when you fall the shit will be funny. I buy my bitch a new a-s and watch her sit on my money. Man all the bitches holla, they wanna drop my bridges than jaw my dick and swallow. Leave drawers in this Impala, I ball like Iguidala,. I bear more arms than 6 koalas. As soon as a I draw get sent to Alaba. I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun, I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn. I pillage your village for fun, And genius gun, a syllable gun. Real as they come, Long Beach Sadan. Slaughterhouse equals swine flu. As I fly we do what you try to do without trying. 'Cause to us it's so easy, where, jump-off Joe Beezy"
shady 2.0 (cypher),"[Intro: Eminem]. Welcome to Detroit. This is the BET, Shady 2.0, Cypher, 2011. Myself, Slaughterhouse, and Yelawolf. White dog, get 'em!. [Verse 1: Yelawolf]. Put these muthafuckas in a box and I send 'em away. Put em in a gray 'llac and pop the trunk. And throw em in the back, jack, ha, dig 'em a grave. Put a brick inside that Xerox when I print 'em a page. Moving keys I can relate, cause I live in the cage. I throw up the A, I take 'em to school, I give them a grade. An easy E for effort, that's the WWA. White with an attitude, alphabet soup is on my plate. All I got is Z's they sleeping on me, I can't get 'em awake. I spoon feed 'em a sound, in a room full of deceivers and clowns. Who believe in making it rain cause all they see is the clouds. And I watch from the couch of the VIP like a potato. With a bunch of meatheads, like fuck it, I'll just feed 'em a cow. Plenty of white boys to pick from this year. But before you pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater. Cause even Peter Piper could pick up a mic. But what it's like to pick a fight with me is like putting Nikes. on a cheetah. Better speed up, or at least in my case Adidas. I'm out this bitch, drinking Sprite by the two-liter. [Verse 2: Joe Budden]. Say I'm from the new school, I'mma say check your tone. and watch your mouth. If they teaching how to Dougie, I'm condoning dropping out. Forced to wild, y'all birthed me then gave me up. I just perfected being hip hop's foster child. Now check it: don't blame y'all for being trash, fans are copping it. The radio's the crime scene, the masses are the hostages. In my youth I'd throw shots, the fad was dodging it. I'm grown: I ain't watching the throne, I'm sabotaging it. You see that 4-headed monster in the storm looms. Snipe 'em from a distance: the scope got a long zoom. You Super Mario thugs is in the wrong room. Gotta figure here, you won't get bigger if you on shrooms. If it was left to me, I'd revive what the game be 'bout. I woulda took the Wine outta Amy House. Enough raps from you scrub cats bout cockin' a snub back. Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that. But I have this chick from uptown, she my summer bunny. Both parents broke, but she come from money. Think my bread is her paper to burn. So I lock her out, and now she doubt David is Stern. She's so bad, I make her hit the telly from a taxi. Then dead her in the Holiday Inn, learned that from Max B. That's why haters envy, kinda wanna send me llamas. I made it right before their eyes like I was Benihanas. Is it me? Or is what I'm hearing just pitiful?. Airwaves the same, now the stereo's typical. My skin's thick, so the critics ignored. So unafraid to die, you'd think I did it before. The boy's Rodman with the trash talk, Magic or Walt. With the black ball, way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws. Glass jaw, Hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with. no passport. Body be found in a mansion in one of my trapdoors. If punks had award you status whores categore. Probably be that of awards between Michael Rappaport. and Kenny Latimore. I know hip hop's alive and well. If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell. [Verse 3: Crooked I]. I spot a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is ticking. I caught him slipping, I gotta give him a shot. I hit him with proper spittin', hottest writtens and compositions. So competition's a contradiction, somebody mention they. got a Crooked. Highly fiction we probably different, got Gotti henchmen. Opposition, I'll body quick as Bugatti engines. I'm on a mission to get richer, the sickest lyric kicker. Digging a ditch for different spitters, weak lyricists get. disfigured. Sip liquor, spit like a sick mixture. Of Notorious, Pun and L, get the big picture?. The poster, I'll roast ya. My mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster. It's over, control my whole coastal region. Like I'm supposed to flow is going postal even. Open season, heart close to freezing. Ruthless as Eazy nigga approach, I'm squeezing, believe me. Dopest Westcoaster breathing. So most ya hope I'm vegan, nope I'm beefing. Rappers need to keep it trill, give me a beat to kill. Too many people still eating sleeping pills, people sleeping. on my ether skills. And y'all ain't even real, you 'bout to die in this cypher. Before you die, you should do the Jada and leave a Will. [Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]. I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap. Before this, I was moving crack. Killers y'all become when y'all rhyme I salute and dap. And if I blink they'll remove your snaps. You ain't cool, you wack with your foolish act. Skinny jeans don't mean your ass shoot, it means. your booty claps. Don't play like Tyler Perry. This the Slaughterhouse of pain, flow brown, tight and heavy. When it come to 16's, I'm a fiend. Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean. Probably writing bars to Nas' Thief's Theme getting. my Yaowa on. Man, all these Olajuwons, we the dream team. This is an all day slaughter. They fiendin' for us to break like Beyonce's water. The four quarters doing all the eating. And y'all gotta know why I made the cut, I'm Puerto Rican. Ortiz keep they fire ready. And tryna put me out's like tryna steal a transvestite from Eddie. [Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9""]. I'm do or die dope and you can make the sticker sitting. On the door of that Phantom, your suicide note. Hi Rihanna.. is Nicki living with you?. Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes. Hi Rihanna.. I don't need to know you better. You tell me you love my music again? We go together. Bye Rihanna.. now back to y'all fools. We rock out like the outside of a guitar school. Thousand dollar frames, I prefer to see the world through. Don't ask me nothing 'bout Budden, I beat my girl too. You ask me why do I keep her, I say it's cheaper to. That's why I ride around in a Rolls like Wiz Khalifa do. Rappers I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this. You don't kill, but your father will like Jayden Smith. I tell you like I tell my Spanish chick. You fly, but I ain't going down on no landing strip. So get your wax on like Daniel San. Or I'mma have to run like De la Hoya in drag when cameras. come. Point out the greatest rapper alive I headshot 'em. Smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom. Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife. While I'm cyber-sexing with Jessica Alba via Skype. I?m on my D-boy, Deebo thing. Spiritual steelo swing like Cee-Lo Green. Get out the camera with yo B Roll bling, you know your. flow is wack. We cornered the market like a Wal-Mart in a cul-de-sac. Yeah, this is what two million singles sold, the album is gold. Look like without having to sell your soul. [Verse 6: Eminem]. Ayo, lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal. Subliminal in your swimming pool. You're about to see peace destroyed, it'll never be restored. When I unleash these beastly hordes on your CD stores. Wanna stop it? You gon' need a priest, at least three swords. A license to ill from the Beastie Boys, three Ouija boards. A squeegee and please be warned, don't ask what the. squeegee's for. Or the holy water, acid raps that'll eat these floors. Eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns?. And as for me you ask when I'm gone, will he be mourned. ..is puke luke warm, should Casey Anthony do porn?. Can that chick fit a new born dead baby inside a fricking. shoebox. With a shoehorn and smother it in chloroform so she. can go get her groove on. Can she duct tape and velcro a fetus?. Joell, yo, tell Joe I need his. Empty box from his old shell toed Adidas. So I can put these babies in the fetal position,. they're getting elbows to the penis. Yeah big deal. I took some little kids big wheel and spit in his frickin. big kids meal. Quit tryna bite me and pinch you wench sit still. Did you just put your six inch heel through my Benz. windsheild?. Is it dust we bout to kick up?. Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup. Between in stick shift in his frigging pickup. And drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will 'til he gets hiccups. Flipping the script up like Mike Vick. Getting bit in his junk by a Pit, yup I'm a sick pup. I'd be a horrible magician, cause I'll fuck a trick up. Fix your lips up to say something fly, or zip up. A B, let's C, you said you were gonna do X-Y-Z. 'til you fuck around and get dropped like an E when you. add an I-N-G. Don't put a K in front of that though, when I MC. I'm not the king of the microphone booth,. it's more like a phone booth. Superman in this bitch, Kryptonite won't do. It gives me more power, I bump the fat boys. And eat rat poison, take meteor showers. Fresh outta the mental hospital. And me not flossing a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit'll. Be like Nas doing gospel or R&B, you crazy. Me pushing up daisies, that thought is impossible. As if flashing across the news, Posdnuos was caught with. a prostitute. With a huge johnson, boobs and a monstrous tube of lube. And a bra, some boots, some panties and a aqua blue Mazda. Swallowin' a popsicle, playing tonsil pool. So kill the rumors it ain?t happening, I?mma rap 'til I'm fossil fuel"
shady narcotics (intro),Yeah!. God damn. Feels like a long time don't it. You missed up. We missed you (haha). Shady narcotics. It's the re-up. Pussies. And we're back. Myself. D12. 50 Cent. Obie Trice. Stat Quo. And I would also like to introduce. The two newest members of the family. One goes by the name of Bobby Creek. The other goes by the name of Cashis. From Orange county.

Cuz then it's gonna get to the point where it is gonna escalade. Into some other shit then I'ma flip. Then I'ma get to stompin in my air force ones. You won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or one. It's gonna feel like so many feet kicking you. You'll think Nike just made these in a cleat tennis shoe. I don't know what it is or what it could be but. I get a woody when these pussies try to push me. Thinking they gon' put me in the position to pick at me. Y'all tickle me pink I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me. Hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety. A little bit of the dickety dock dickety. Mixed with a little bit of the jigga-j-jigga.

shady xv,"[Verse 1]. I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought. I disgust you like dialogue from the shop to The Wired Frog. Night club, shit, I was taught if you see these on fire. You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park, no fire department. So you may not hear sirens at all. But don't be alarmed if I sound off. Something just ain't right with me, dawg. A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder. Widely regarded, highly bite me, sweetheart, I'm slightly retarded. But tonight I'm starting shit, I'm feeling self righteous. I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit. Looking to box with anybody, disorderly conduct. I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith. Fan of the Lox, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock. Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet. Panic attack cause I'm claustrophobic. No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver from movement. Cause I had no room for improvement. I'm practically squashed, unpacked it and boxed it. Toxic, hands are arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content. Bar exam, start of insanity. Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson. Animal snarls, cannibal jaws. Shark mandibles, lambs that'll slaughter. Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking. Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets. Black out, Zach Galifianakis, gallons of Vodka. But I gallon some knockers. I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious. What happened, doc? I passed out again. Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked. Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Doxon. Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics. Too close to the stair master. Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it. Woke up shortly there after, hungover. No one to wear, grasping a bear, rasped it and dropped it. Air Max in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich. And the cross stitching is a cross mix. Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin. Dolphin fin dockers, eyes cautious, drop crotches. Swats watches and sneakers matches with the parkers. But it's like being overstepped at a boxing gym. With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers. And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted. Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious. Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?. Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle 'em all. I'll stand there and yell mad at a wall. Until the mannequin doll scatter the inanimate objects. That I'm badder than all, shatter and fall. Cause I hear the track. And I'm starting to get fucking amped, I'mma spark plug. Like the car with the cables hooked to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell. But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped. And I'd catch the battery charge, but. I got a hunch like your back when it's arching. When I start attacking your squadron. You'll feel like Master Card when I'm charging. So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you. Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers. So get the sack of Wisconsin. That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?. You faggots are all gonna do my bidding. Don't get dragged to the auction. Neiman Marcus, bags of the Tylenol. I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this. Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass. See I'm at you wack when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave. In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping. Affable guy next door is laughable. My next whore's gon' have mechanical arms. That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor. No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard. I got a Magic Johnson. It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me. If Ronda Rousey was on the couch, with the condoms out. Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me. I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me. Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around. And all I see is [?] she's slaughterhouse in a blouse. And Madonna with mud on her, got dammit I am misogynist. I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony. Just so happens she's fond of Al. Cause now she's faceplants on the concrete. Complete lack of responsibility. Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit. Shit, you faggots couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop. But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy. Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now. Five finger discount. Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy. Kidnapping your mom cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery. Ransom for Jonbenét Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit. Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde. I might relapse, get to some bullshit. Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson. Macklemore and Mac Miller and Asher Roth. Have some back and forths. And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's Control verse. And perform Fack in concert. [Fack plays]. Yo, I put that shit on a Greatest Hits album. Now that was awesome. It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that. Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like. (I'll stick around). And put up with my crap so long for. What's the attraction, mama?. Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre. Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?. Who knows at this point, it's always poking so meh. Still get along with this voice cause that's the monster. So do-si-do with a sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that. What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio, meh. She loves the way I lie. Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow. Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole. That might've disguise pants, but they on fire. So am I-a, wooh, Cappadonna, cut the track off. Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking. I'm wrapping up all the presents. In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em. Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off. Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him. Blowing the head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Put the basket back while the bath salt packets are gone. Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier. But classic rock acid rap is the genre. Got Slash on guitar, splashing Bizarre, Trasher and Aerosmith. And I'm a spectacular archer, feed count Dracula Chocula. Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan. Bandwagoners kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em. Smack Kim Basinger on the ass"

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fuucked up. Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed. Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted. Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink. Hit the bathroom sink, throw up. Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine. Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring.

I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck. Apple Bottom jeans and a big old slut. Some girls they act retarded. Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it. I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on. Knows that she can't but she won't say no. Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be. Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?. I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine. [Eminem]. Now I'ma hope you don't get mad at me. But I told Nate you was a freak. He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind. I told him that you like it from behind. Chorus. [Nate Dogg]. We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up). Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt).

I'm from Atlanta, so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar. I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo. But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana. Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose. Sippin' everything from white cran to deuce-deuce. With nothin' to gain but my grains and loose tooths. Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too. Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new too. But the money been around, my drinks is ten around.

shit on you,"Eminem - Shit On You. [Eminem - 4x]. I'll Shit On You. Da da, da da, da da. [Eminem]. I'll Shit On You. I will Shit On You. I'll Shit On You. Girl you know its true. I'll Shit On You. Bitch or man. I'll Shit On You. I will Shit On You. [Swifty]. I remain fatter than gluttony. Taping bombs to the back of record companies. Blow them up if they ain't want me. The National Guard, they scared to hunt me. I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me. A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana. These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner. I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas. You can act a fool if you wanna (bitch). It's this lyrical piranha. Strapped with a grenade, in the pool with your mama. Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom. Twist nothin up like a condom. Slap it if you fuckers got a problem. When I see them, you hoes ending up in a fuckin mausoleum. Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM. Pull in the garage while you screamin. Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll Shit On You!). I'll shit on you!. Chorus: Eminem. I will shit on you I don't care who you are. (I'll Shit On You!). I don't give a fuck about you or your car. (I'll Shit On You!). Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch. (I'll Shit On You!). Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family. (I'll Shit On You!). [Bizarre]. I'm a alcoholic with the fucking toilet. Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?). Bitch shut your fucking mouth. I'ma keep eating 'till Richard Simmons comes to my house. with a chain saw to cut me out. I'll fuck your wife. I had sex since I met her. I'm to busy fucking, your 12 year old baby sitter. And all women ain't shit. Only good for cooking, cleaning. and sucking dick and thats it (I said it). I was responsible for killing John Candy. I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry. I don't give a fuck who you are. I'll shit on anybody. Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre. [Eminem]. My adolescent years weren't shit 'till what I do now. I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down. The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in. The more ignorant, the incident, is I fit in. Ignoring the shit how boring it gets. When there's no one to hit. I don't know when to quit throwing a fit. I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me. Its they who raised me and say the can take me. Its they who legs I brake and make achy. Its they who mistake me and make me so angry. (I'll Shit On You!) I'll spit on you. Start pissing and do the opposite on you. You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you. Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and. Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch. on his skit on his last album. Pull my pants down and... Chorus. [Kon Artist]. Is Richard Pryor still alive?. If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying (what?). Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless. Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it. Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with. Will hang you up naked by your ankles dangling. My need I stay strangling. I don't need your help. If you gon' give me the pussy. I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll Shit On You!). I'll punch your daddy not, your mom's kinda cock. Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks. Buck fifty cross your neck. Floss your teck, I'll beat you with it across your chest. [Kuniva]. It's only right I jack your car keys and run. Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns. For fun, when I'm drunk. I'll run a truck through the weed house. Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout. Put you in chokeholds I learned last week. From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep. (Hey, hey, hey!). I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl. Thats like D-Bo fightin Peablo Bryson (I'll Shit On You). So what you hollering and yelling about. I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out. Niggas get hit with a two piece, ""Bling Bling"". With a poisonous sting. I'm such a violent thing. Chorus. [Eminem]. Once I get on two, hits of X. My disk slips and disconnects. 'Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck. But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects. (C'mon, I'll Shit On You!). Over reaction is my only reaction. Which only sets off a chain reaction. and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action. A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten. Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters. and spilling liters of blood like swimming pools. Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too {*Bullets spray*}. A lot of people say misoginistic which is true. I can't deny it matter of fact I stand by it. So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot. If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet.

sing for the moment,"[Verse 1]. These ideas are nightmares to white parents. Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair. And who likes earrings. Like whatever they say has no bearing,. it's so scary. In a house that allows no swearing. To see him walking around with his headphones blaring. Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care. He's a problem child. And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about. His fuckin' dad walkin' out. 'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out. If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out. His thoughts are whacked,. he's mad so he's talkin' back. Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap. He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap. His step-father hit him, so he socked him back,. and broke his nose. His house is a broken home,. there's no control,. he just let's his emotions go.... [Chorus]. {C'mon}, sing with me, {sing}, sing for the years. {Sing it}, sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, {c'mon). Sing it with me, just for today,. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away.... [Verse 2]. Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's. In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum. Holy or unholy, only have one homie. Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me. Yet everybody just feels like they can relate,. I guess words are a mothafucka. They can be great or they can degrade,. Or even worse they can teach hate. It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make. Like they worship us,. Plus all the stores ship us platinum. Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen. From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'. To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass. But then these critics crucify you,. journalists try to burn you. Fans turn on you,. attorneys all want a turn at you. To get they hands on every dime you have,. They want you to lose your mind every time you mad. So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon. Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns. That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me,. Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly. But all their kids be listenin' to me religiously,. So I'm signin' cd's while police fingerprint me. They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me. If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete. It's all political,. If my music is literal, and I'm a criminal. How the fuck can I raise a little girl. I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to. You're full of shit too, Guerrera,. that was a fist that hit you.... [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. They say music can alter moods and talk to you. Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too?. Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude. Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued. See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols. And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool. Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves,. We entertainers!. Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus!. But music is reflection of self, we just explain it,. And then we get our checks in the mail. It's fucked up, ain't it?. How we can come from practically nothing. to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted. That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing. Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine. Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long. Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs. Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives. Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die. Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe. We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes. That's why we seize the moment. Try to freeze it and own it,. squeeze it and hold it. Cause we consider these minutes golden. And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone. Just let our spirits live on. through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can..."
smack that,"[Akon]. Konvict. Up front. Akon. Slim Shady. I see the one. 'cause she be that lady. CHORUS [Akon]:. I feel you creepin', I can see from my shadow. Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo. Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo. And possibly bend ya over. Look back and watch me. Smack that, all on the floor. Smack that, give me some more. Smack that, till you get sore. Smack that, oooh. Smack that, all on the floor. Smack that, give me some more. Smack that, till you get sore. Smack that, oooh. [Akon]. Upfront style ready to attack now. pull in the parking lot slow. with the lac down. Convicts got the whole thing packed now. Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now. I feel it, go on and crack now. All I see is all that back now. I'ma call her, then I put the mack down. Money no problem, pocket full of that now. Chorus. [Eminem]. Ooh...Looks like another club banger. They better hang on. when they throw this thing on. Get a lil drink on. They gonna flip for this Akon shit. You can bank on it!. Pedicure (manicure) kitty-cat claws. The way she climbs up and down them poles. Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls. Trying to hold my woodie back thru my (drawers). Steps upstage (didn't) think I saw. Creeps up behind me, shes like 'yoo'. I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase. No time to waste back to my place. Plus from the club to the crib. it's like a mile away. (More like a palace) shall I say. Plus I got pal (every gal is) game. In fact he is the one singing. the song that's playing. 'Akon!'. Chorus. [Akon]. Eminem is rollin', d and em rollin' bo. And all marvelous them rolling. Women just holding big booty rollin'. Soon I'll be on Eminem throwin 'D!'. Hittin on less than 'Three!'. Block wheel style like 'Whee!'. Girl I can tell you want me because lately. Chorus"
snitch,"[Intro: Obie Trice + (Eminem) {Akon}]. {Convict}. (Yeah,haha haha SHADY). {Convict Music}. (Guess who's back). Still here, haters. {Akon & Obie Trice, Yeah}. Whatcha gonna do it with it, A?. Whatcha gonna do?. {Take em on back to the street}. [Chorus: Akon]. I keep the 40 cal on my side,. Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster,. See a nigga pass by,. Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya,. Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale,. Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you,. Just don't, whatever you do, Snitch. Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah. [Obie Trice]. It's risky, the bitch tend to rise out a nigga. It's history, Snitch, who decided he's a member. Once he got pinched, coincided with law. Same homie say he lay it down for the boy. Brought game squad around ours. How could it be? Been homies since Superman draws. Only foniness never came to par. He had us, a true neighborhood actor. Had his back with K's. Now we see through him like X-Ray's. Cuffed in that Adam car. No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war. Knowing not to cross those resevoir dogs. You helped plant seeds just to be a vegetable. When we invest in team, it's to the death fo sho. [Hook]. No ex and oh's, tex calicos. Aim at your chest nicca. [Chorus]. [Obie Trice]. We started out as a crew, in one speak, it's all honest. Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's. Recondences when we peep enemies on us. Been in these corners, sellin like anything on us. Knowing heaven has shown us being devil's minors. That ain't got shit to do with the tea in China. We gon keep the grind up til death come find us. Mean time leanin in them European whips reclined up. It's an eye for an eye for the riders. We ain't trying to get locked up, we soul survivors. Po Pos is cowards, there's no you, it's ours. We vow this, mixing yayo with soda powder. Who woulda known he would fold and cower. Once the captain showed, he sold whole McDonalds. So.... [Hook]. [Chorus]. [Obie Trice]. Nowadays, Sammy Da Bull's got the game full. So he move to a rural area to keep cool. They snitchin on a snitch now, there's nothin to tell. Nowadays, your circles should be small as hell. Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me. Even if we bubble slow, we get it eventually. No penitentary, there will be no climincy. You will meet the lowest snitch in given us a century. These cats is rats now, the streets need decon. That's how they react now, weak when the heat's on em. Stop snitchin, you asked for the life your living. This act is not permitted, Nowhere on the map, It is. Forbidden to send a nigga to prison if you been in it. Along with em and then snitch and become hidden. So.... [Hook]. [Chorus]. [Obie Trice]. You rat bastard"
so bad,"(Intro). Yeah... haha, you feel that baby? Yeah I feel it too. Damn... you know, I'm so glad we can spend this time together. See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I? haha.

Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for aspin. What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?. Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin. You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again. Now, it all started with my father. I must've got my pimpin' jeans from him, the way he left my momma. I'ma rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama. Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise. There ain't nobody as bomb as... me, I'm as calm as the breeze. I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms. I'm a superstar, girl I'm ready for ya momma. Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas. (Hook). So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad. I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had. Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me. And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again. So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad. I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had. Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me. And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again. (Verse 2). I'm equivalent to a shot of cuervo. First to kiss you naval, work my way down. Baby you can lay down on the table. But you may wanna find something more stable. I told ya I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April. But thank you for staying April. I'mma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me. From these phoney lil fishy and sissy fake G's. Skip over the huggie bear, and all the kissy-face please. Initiate phase three, missy now service me. Take another shot of jeiger, shake it so nervously. Take your time baby, oh you're the bomb baby. Ooh you're doing that even better than your mum lady. I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?. Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding witcha. Got a twisted sense of humour, it's warped but I didn't hit ya.

I can hold you in the morning, but in the evening, I gotta go. Cause I'm on to the next girl, and the next girl, I kinda like oh, oh, oh. (Verse 3). I got you caught up in the rapture. Make you recapture the feelings you had for. Your last boyfriend before he slapped ya. You never wanted someone so bad ya. Sweating, but If I'm what you wanted. Why'd you panic when I grabbed ya. Girl don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic. Don't try to fight the feeling of something this so organic. You can't ignore it so just stand before it. Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'. Damn shawty, I told you this is bound to happen. Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin. I was bound to work a number on your back and. Throw your spine out of alignement. My love has got you so blind. That you couldn't pick anyone else out of a line up. So stop with the stall, pick your pint up. Let's get the pineapple snapz going. No one'll knock cause I'm gonna hang a sign up. Saying don't disturb, shawty I'm so superb. I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?. (Hook). So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad. I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had. Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me. And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again. So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad. I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had. Cause you ain't ever met nobody like me.

so far,"[Intro]. I own a mansion, but live in a house. A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch. I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half full. But my tank is half empty, gas kit just blew. [Verse 1]. This always happens, 30 minutes from home. Gotta lay a long cable. and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom. In a public stall dropping a football. So every time someone walks in the john like at Madden. ''Shady, what up? ''- What? Come on, man, I'm crapping. And you're asking me for my godamn autograph on a napkin?. Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue. Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then. ''Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan''. I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up [?] back and. Told him ''Todd, you're the shit''. when does all of this crap end?. Can't park my [?] without causing an accident. Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the fucking trash. Without someone passing through my sub harassing. I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math. I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash. But the [?] is my stomach as. I mix my corn with my fucking mash. Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bucking ass. Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is up with glass?. Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper. Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass. Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?. B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass. [Hook]. Maybe that's why I feel so strange. Got it all, but I still won't change. Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit. It's the motivation that keeps me going. This is the inspiration I need. I can never turn my back on a city that made me. (Life's been good to me so far). [Verse 2]. They call me [?] , I heard that, I second and third that. Don't know what the fuck I would doing if it weren't rap. Probably be a giant turd-sack. But I blew, never turned back. Turned 40 and still sag. Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack. Fuck you gonna say to me?. I live on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berzerk. My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has. I get to meet famous people, look at her, dad. Her eyeliners ran, her skirt snag. And I heard she drag-races, burp* swag. Fucking my Hanes shirt tag. You're Danica Patrick (yeah) work, skag. We'd be the perfect match. Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag. My apologies, no disrespect to technology. But what the heck is all of these buttons?. You expect me to sit here and learn that?. Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?. Be and expert at computers?. I'd rather be an encyclopedia [?] Playstation. I'm still on my first manual from Zelda. Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the. Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread. Make a sandwich with [?] and belts. They say it's [?] , but it's bad for my health. But I think there's more white trash from the trailer. [?] welfare mentality helps to keep me grounded. that's why I never take full advantage of wealth. I Managed to dwell within these perimeters. still cramming the shells full of hamburger helper. I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to. [?] a habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter. With all these pet peeves. Got dammit to hell. I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones. I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell the. Other day someone got little elaborate. and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox. Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings. I think my karma is catching up with me. [Hook]. Maybe that's why I feel so strange. Got it all, but I still won't change. Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit. It's the motivation that keeps me going. This is the inspiration I need. I can never turn my back on a city that made me. (Life's been good to me so far). [Bridge]. Got friends on facebook, all over the world. Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good. So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque. I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked. [Verse 3]. Trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me. [?] got punched over, giant nosebleed. As I mosey over to the frozen isle. By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me. Embarrassed, I just did [?] America with Hova. Show's over, I'm hiding in [?] buying groceries. He had front row seats, told me to sign this poster. Then insults me ''wow, up close. didn't know you had gross feet''. Still shopping at Costco. Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles. Got caught picking my nose, ah. Look over see these two hot hoes. Finger still stuck up in one of my nostrils. Right next to him stuck at the light. This fucking shit is taking forever to change. I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in. Couldn't do nothing, play it off. ''What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better''. fucking bitch. They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it. The pressure, they want me to follow up. with another one after Recovery. So highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery. if I fumble it?. Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get to quit. On you sons of bitches. Quit snapping pictures of my fucking kids. I love my [?] , but you push me to my limit, what a pity. The shit I complain about. It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out. Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out. Bitch, I got an elevator in my house. [?] I'm living the dream. [Hook]"

I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3. [verse 2]. Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink. Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone. And just think. Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go. Cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk. Cause that bitch drove me to drink. I'm back on my fuck ho's. But a whole new hatred for blondes, but bias?. I hate all bitches the same, baby come on. Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement. And I am channeling my anger. Through every single station it's on. Cause a woman broke my he-art. I say he-art cause you ripped it in two pa-arts. And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?. Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off. And pick myself up off the carpet.

Say fuck it kick some shots back. Get hammered and nail her. These bitches tryna get attached but they're failing. To latch onto the tail of my bumper. To scratch them with the back of my trailer.

sometimes,"Aight listen …. Sometimes you’ve got to turn the beat up cuz its sick. Listen … fuck it , just let me spit….. Yow……. Here goes ….. Sometimes I feel like hurting the people who hurted me. Or even murder them, see. am a renegade ,revenge is what I need. am not the type who smokes weed to impress. I would smoke it cuz am depressed. But I don’t need drugs to make new friends. Like all the rest of you fagots think. Sometimes am starting to scrabble shit. But just can’t finish it of. And when it looks ready am trying to spit it. But keep forgetting the words. Sometimes we’ve got to see the difference between. Real life and music and what’s on our mind. Sometimes we’ve got to leave the misery behind. And read between the lines. Sometimes we even got to drive trough red lights. And kill mic’s we might wanna answer some questions right. Sometimes when am alone am starting to think. Why do I even exist I’ve got nothing to bring. And in class am the weakest link and then am starting to sing. But I want ya’ll people to realize and starting to see. that somewhere deep down there’s a decent human being in me. sometimes when am alone I feel like quitting this life. but then I realize that it aint right. some shit reminds me of the dad I never had. why do I keep running from what I needed so bad. Sometimes I think life’s a game. And everybody’s a player who got. Something to bring or something to say. We got prayers, cops, waitresses even snobs. Who stink in there jobs but still get paid a lot. Sometimes life’s fucked up….. Sometimes we’ve got to see the difference between. Real life and music and what’s on our mind. Sometimes we’ve got to leave the misery behind. And read between the lines. Sometimes we even got to drive trough red lights. And kill mic’s we might wanna answer some questions right"

Drop to my knees and I'm pleading. I'm trying to stop you from leaving. You won't even listen, so fuck it. I'm trying to stop you from breathing. I put both hands on your throat. I sit on top of you, squeezing. Til I snap ya neck like a Popsicle stick. Ain't no possible reason, I could think of. To let you walk up out this house, and let you live. Tears streamed down both of my cheeks. Then I let you go and just give. And before I put that gun to my temple. I told you this. And I would've do anything for you. To show you how much I adored you.

"spend some time (feat. obie trice, stat quo, 50 cent)","[Eminem]. If there's any bitches in this room. then there's something I gotta say. For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way. I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one. Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from. [Obie Trice]. I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control. Even though my penis was deep down in your hole. You should know between us we was like mates to soul. Nothing could intervene us, especially no ho's. You was more or so the chalant type, I chose. To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose. That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows. In the beginning, friends we decided to roll. So who's responsible when you get excited, explode. And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold. But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate. We established this way before we became mates. So what's required is that you chill with all that fire. Get your desire when I retire. Chorus. Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine. I never thought I'd find someone to be mine. Lord knows I was right, 'cause you just crossed the line. Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine. [Eminem]. I used to say I never met a girl like you before. Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are. Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters. Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers. Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for. Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore. You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours. All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls. If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad. When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off. But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off. It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on. You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue. And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me. And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly. Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me. It's true that I got shot in the heart. But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are. But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see. Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach. Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat. Before you make a decision that's life altering. And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave. You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring. Chorus. [Stat Quo]. In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck a bitch. My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch. But you was different, thought we shared a covenant. Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this. Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit. Tryna play sick thinkin' I'ma trick off rick. I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit. Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss. We started off closer than close. But who coulda predicted to know. Your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth. And the final result, back in that same boat. I ask myself, do I love these hoes? No!. [50 Cent]. Em introduced us, ""50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"". Then slid off and left her to kick it with me. I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips. With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick. We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast. Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass. Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline. Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind. She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too. Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?. Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice. Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?. Chorus"

X go head up, the fuck never ran from it,. I got engadged with buck shots that you can't stomach,. You ain't a killer you a album filler,. You ain't a soldier you a rap premoter,. Game over.... CHORUS"
square dance,"[Intro]. People! It feels so good to be back. Ladies and gentleman, introducing the new and improved,. you know who. [Verse 1]. Never been the type to bend or budge. The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush. I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese. I'm a pitbull off his leash,. All this peace talk can cease. All these people I had to leave in limbo. I'm back now, I've come to release this info. So I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple. Canibitch don't want no beef with Slim, nooooo!. Not even on my radar. So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off. And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos. From seance to seance. Aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw. [Chorus 2x]. C'mon now, let's all get on down. Let's do-si-do now. We gon' have a good time. Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothing to worry about. Let your hair down. And square dance with me!. [Verse 2]. Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back. Boo! The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back. With a plan to ambush this Bush administration. Mush the Senate's face and push this generation. Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say. something you might not like. This white hot light that I'm under,. no wonder I look so sunburnt. Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned. Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere. Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there. Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there. Go to the Beirut and do a show there. Yeah you laugh till your mothafucking ass gets drafted. While you're at band camp. Thinking that crap can't happen. Till you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin. Inside a package wrapped in Saran wrap wrappin'. Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'. Fucking assassins hi-jackin' Amtrak's. Crashin' all this terror, America demands action. Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'. To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy. You just a baby getting recruited at 18. You're on a plane now, eating their food and their baked beans. I'm 28, they gonna take you 'fore they take me. Crazy insane or insane crazy?. When I say Hussein, you say Shady. My views ain't changed, still Inhumane, wait. Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!. [Chorus 2x]. [Verse 3]. Nothing moves me more than a groove that soothes me. Nothing soothes me more than a groove that boosts me. Nothing boosts me more or suits me beautifully. There's nothing you can do to me,. Stab me, shoot me. Psychotic, hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic. Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada. God I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la. Oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da. But you gotta gotta. Keep moving, there's more music to make. Keep making new shit, produce hits to break. The monotony, what's gotten into me?. Drugs, rock and Hennessey,. Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies. On your knees, Got you under siege. Somebody you would give a lung to be. Hungry like a fucking younger me. Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free. Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny. I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothin'. I'm past bluffing. Pass the K-Y, let's get ready for some intense serious ass whooping!. [Chorus]. Dr. Dre wants to square dance with me. Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me. X to the Z wants to square dance with me. Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me. Can-a-bitch won't square dance with me. Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me. Canada-bis don't want no parts of me. Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you. Yeeehawww!"

He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her. I can relate to what you're saying in your songs. So when I have a shitty day,. I drift away and Put 'em on. Cause I don't really got shit else. so that shit helps When I'm depressed. I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest. Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds. It's like adrenaline,. the pain is such a sudden rush for me. See everything you say is real,. and I respect you cause You tell it. My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7. But she don't know you like I know you slim,. No one does. She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up. You gotta call me man,. I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. Sincerely yours, stan -- p.s.. We should be together too. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I... Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window... And I can't see at all.

This'll be the last package I ever send your ass. It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?. I know you got my last two letters;. I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect. So this is my cassette I'm sending you,. I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway. Hey slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?. You know the song by phil collins,. ""in the air of the night"". About that guy who coulda saved that other. Guy from drowning. But didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?. That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued. Me from drowning. Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now,. I'm drowsy. And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall. I love you slim, we coulda been together, think about it. You ruined it now, I hope you can't. Sleep and you dream about it. And when you dream. I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it. I hope your conscience eats at you and you. Can't breathe without me. See slim; [*screaming*] shut up bitch!. I'm tryin to talk!. Hey slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see. I ain't like you. Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more,. and then she'll die too. Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now. Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I... Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window... And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'll all be gray,. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad... Dear stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy. You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?. Look, I'm really flattered you would call your. Daughter that. And here's an autograph for your brother,. I wrote it on the starter cap. I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show,. I musta missed you. Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you. But what's this shit you said about you like to cut. Your wrists too?. I say that shit just clownin dogg,. C'mon - how fucked up is you?. You got some issues stan, I think you need. Some counseling. To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when. You get down some. And what's this shit about us meant to be together?. That type of shit'll make me not want us. To meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter,. I just hope it reaches you in time. before you hurt yourself,. I think that you'll be doin just fine. If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but stan. Why are you so mad?. Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy shit. I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that. Made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge. And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant. With his kid. And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say. Who it was to. Come to think about, his name was.. it was you. Damn!"

stepping stone,"Its 2002, everything was totally new. We were globally huge. Watching sales go through the roof. We wrote and we viewed it. Runyon Avenue soldiers included. A multitude of homies who would bounce. for no good excuse. We were so bulletproof wrote, souped. and soaked in our youth. Thought we was running shit. till we lost the sole of our shoe. The death of Doody broke us in two. We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do. And at the time I was going through my own struggles too. So I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through. Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew. I was hoping they do. So I ain't have to shoulder the group. The plan was put everyone in position. so that they knew how to stand on they own. and I don't want to open up wounds. I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth. Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died. so did the group. If I could leave this all behind. I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line. Down to the river with you. Help me leave this all behind. I'ma wash away my sins. I'ma rinse away this dirt. I forgot to make amends. To all the friends I may have hurt. I better stop and say my grace. From that I pray that I don't fall. 'Cause on the way back down I may. May end up running back into them all. I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones. It was never the same, and it's bothered me since. And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets. The more time goes by, the more life happens. And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities. Plus we don't say how we feel. and I feel like this is what got us in. The debacle we're in. been with you guys thick and thin. But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends. Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit. Y'all could've got you a hit without me on the shit. If you've put D12 on it, wish I could've did. More than try talking you into coming up off of it. I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is. I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers. I wish that we would've politicked with. Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features. But that's water under the bridge. But I'm washing my sins in it. til my conscious is clear. If I could leave this all behind. I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line. Down to the river with you. Help me leave this all behind. I'ma wash away my sins. I'ma rinse away this dirt. I forgot to make amends. To all the friends I may have hurt. I better stop and say my grace. From that I pray that I don't fall. 'Cause on the way back down I may. May end up running back into them all. I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones. Bacardi in hand. Never thought the party would end. One minute you're bodyin' shit. but then your audience splits. You can already sense the climate is starting to shift. To these kids you no longer exist. Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch. To tiny drops full of drips. And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed. You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift. All the carnage you left. Is this the kinda karma you get?. For turning your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift. A Freudian slip. Subconsciously, I honestly wished. I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment. But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this. Wish I had words. But I guess there just are none for this. Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am. This is not how I planned for our story to end. I love all of you, men. But I just can't be the guy. Everybody depends on for entire careers. 'Cause that's not even fair. I will always be here. But that spark isn't there. And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air. I've tried hearkening back to. But I'm fighting for air. I'm barely charting myself. Feels like I'm under the sink. But it was not my intent. To treat y'all like a stepping stone. Though I ain't left no one behind. But we been down every road. Done all we possibly can. I know we kept up our hopes up. But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live. The less is left for closure, so let's let this go. It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over. I'ma wash away my sins. I'ma rinse away this dirt. I forgot to make amends. To all the friends I may have hurt. I better stop and say my grace. From that I pray that I don't fall. 'Cause on the way back down I may. May end up running back into them all. I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones. I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones. I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones"

still don't give a fuck,"A lot of people ask me. Am I afraid of death?. Hell yeah I'm afraid of death,. I don't wanna die yet.. A lot of people think that I worship the devil,. That I do all types of retarded shit.. Look, I can't change the way I think,. I can't change the way I am,. But if I affended you, good. 'cause I still don't give a fuck. I'm zonin' offa one joint. Stoppin' the limo. Hop in the window. Shoppin' the demo at gun point.. A lyricist without a clue. What year is this?. Fuck a needle, heres a sword. Body pierce with this.. Livin' them up. Never givin' a fuck. Gimme the keys I'm drunk. And I've never drivin' the truck.. But I smoke dope in the cab. I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab. Come back the next week and re-open the scab.. A killer instinct runs in the blood. Empty your four clips and bury your guns in the mud.. I've calmed down now. I was heavy once into drugs. I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz.. My brain's gone. So worn my spirit is torn. The rest of my body is still being operated on. I'm duckin' the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme. 'cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time.. To all the weed that I've smoked,. Yo this blunt's for you.. To all the people I've affended,. Yeah fuck you too.. To all the friends I use to have,. I miss my past. But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass.. For all the drugs that I've done,. Yo I'm still gonna do.. To all the people I've affended,. Ya fuck you too.. Every time I reminist,. Yo I miss my past.. But I still don't give a fuck,. Ya'll can kiss my ass!. I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you. Cut you so fast. When your blood spilled it was still blue. I'll hang you 'til you dangle. And chain you at both ankles. And pull you apart from both angles. I wanna crush your skull. 'til your brains leak out of your veins. And bust open like broken water mains.. So tell sadam not to bother. with making another bomb. 'cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm. I got your girl in my arm. And I'm armed with a fire arm. So big my entire arm's a giant fire bomb. Buy your mom a shirt with a slim shady iron-on. And the pants that match. Here mama try 'em on. I get amastertive. With a mouth full of adjectives. A brain full of adverbs. And a box full of laxitives. Proff of all school accidents. God help me. Before I commit some irresponsible acts again. To all the weed that I've smoked,. Yo this blunt's for you.. To all the people I've affended,. Yeah fuck you too.. To all the friends I use to have,. I miss my past. But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass.. For all the drugs that I've done,. Yo I'm still gonna do.. To all the people I've affended,. Ya fuck you too.. Every time I reminist,. Yo I miss my past.. But I still don't give a fuck,. Ya'll can kiss my ass!. I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it. I spent a million a track. And went over my budget. Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt. I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet. Drug sickness got me doin' some bug twitches. I'm withdrawling from crack so bad my blood itches. I don't rap to get the women. Fuck bitches. Gimme a fat slut that cooks and does dishes. Never ran with a clique I'm a posse. Kamikaze. Strappin' the mother fuckin' bomb accross me. From the second I was born My mama lost me. I'm a cross between manson-each ominozzi. I don't even know why the fuck I'm here in the first place.. The worst day on this earth was my first birthday.. Retarded. What did that nurse say?. Brain damage. Fuck I was born during an earthquake. To all the weed that I've smoked,. Yo this blunt's for you.. To all the people I've affended,. Yeah fuck you too.. To all the friends I use to have,. I miss my past. But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass.. For all the drugs that I've done,. Yo I'm still gonna do.. To all the people I've affended,. Ya fuck you too.. Every time I reminist,. Yo I miss my past.. But I still don't give a fuck,. Ya'll can kiss my ass!"
stimulate,"Listen Now! -. Psst... Hey, Listen. I love my job. It makes me feel like... superman. Can you fly?. I can. Wanna see?. [Chorus]. I'm only entertaining you my. Goal is to stimulate making you high. And take you and I, to a place that you can't see. But I believe you can fly. I don't need nobody home I'm just partying. I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian. Just a man whos on the mic, so let me... entertain you. [Verse 1]. My lyrical content is constantly undefined. No wonder why I constantly bomb back. To combat attacks with constant concepts. From lyrics constantly took out of context. Failure to communicate with congresses. Been a problem for the longest I guess but. Maybe one day we can make some progress. Food for thought see how long it takes to digest. Feeling good when I should be ashamed. Shit, I really should've fell when I stood. See I came like a flame in the night. Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light. There's a hope there's a spark. But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye. Until they decide to set the differences aside. And this is why only one of us will survive. So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because. [Chorus x1]. [Verse 2]. My music can be slightly amusing. You shouldn't take lyrics so serious. It might be confusing. Trying to seperate the truth from entertainment. It's stupid ain't it?. I get sick of trying to explain it. See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond. Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde. Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone. Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on. Constantly movin' constantly using the constitution. As a form of restitution. Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant. Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams. I'll be here when y'all are gone re-building. We're all revolving, still evolving, still Slim. How many kids will cop me?. Probably millions. But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then.... [Chorus X1]. [Verse 3]. My lyrical content contains subject matter. That sucks up all these fucked up young kids. Out of a long and great common denominate. Add it up and you'll see thats why I dominate. I try to stimulate but kids imulate. And mimmick ever move you make. ""Slim you're great"". But wait, can't you see im only here to entertain?. I gotta be the one to go against the grain. Cuz man, I see it, feel it, live it. But its inhumane for me to see you be influenced. And pretend you ain't. But they don't understand that i've been through pain. If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain. But you can't just stand there and try to touch. It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much. And its such a pleasure every button that I touch. I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust. But i'm."

Psych, no way fucked up in the head. Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed (Wait, wait, wait). I'm a crazy mothafucka might shoot me a fed. Or I just might start a fist fight instead.

Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented. I'll throw a stroller at u, with a baby in it. Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you. I just dropped a fuckin' pill mom, dont vacuum!!!.

stronger than i was,"[Verse 1]. You used to say that I'd never be. nothing without you and I believe. I'm striving the roads,. I guess I can't breathe. just lay here with me, baby,. hold me please. And I beg and I plead, drop to knees. And I cry and I scream, baby, please don't leave. Snatch the keys from your hand. I would squeeze and you'd laugh. And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me. And you must hate me. Why do you date me. if you say I make you sick?. And you've had enough of me. I smother you, I'm about. to jump off the edge. [Hook]. But you won't break me. You just make me stronger than I was. Before I met you, I'll bet you. I'll be just fine without you. And if I stumble, I won't crumble. I get back up and aah. And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you. Cause I'm stronger than I was. [Verse 2]. A beautiful face is all that you had. Cause on the inside you're ugly, man. But you're all that I love. I guess you can't leave. Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please. And I beg and I plead, drop to knees. And I cry and I scream, baby, please don't leave. Cause you left and you took everything I had left. And left nothing, nothing for me. So please don't wake me from this dream, baby. We're still together in my head. And you're still in love with me. Till I woke up to discover. that dream was dead. [Hook]. But you won't break me. You just make me stronger than I was. Before I met you, I'll bet you. I'll be just fine without you. And if I stumble, I won't crumble. I get back up and aah. And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you. Cause I'm stronger than I was. [Verse 3]. You walked out, I almost died. It was almost a homicide that you caused. cause I was so traumatized. Felt like I was in for a long bus ride. I'd rather die than not you by my side. Can't count how many times I vomited, cried. Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide. You were Bonnie and Clyde. No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde. Felt like my whole relationship. with you was a lie. It was you and I, why did I think it was ride. or die?. cause if you could've took my life. you would've. It's like you put a knife to my chest. and pushed it right through to the. other side of my pack, stuck a spike,. you should've. put up more of a fight, but I couldn't. at the time no one could hurt me like you could've. Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?. Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer. Cause this morning I finally stood up. Held my chin up,. finally showed a sign of life for me for the. First time since you left me and left me. with nothing but shattered dreams. And a life we could've had and we. could've been. But I'm breaking out of this lump I'm in. Pulling myself out of the dump once again. I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit. I'mma be late for the pity party. But you're never gonna beat me. to the fucking punch again. Took it on the chin like a champ. so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends. I'm done being your punching bag. It was the November 31st today. would've been our anniversary. Two years, but you left on the first of May. I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call. but couldn't think of the words to say. But it came to me just now,. so I put them in a verse to lay. And I thank you. cause you made me a better person than I was. But I hate you cause you drained me. I gave you all, you gave me none. But if you blame me you're crazy. And after all that's said and done. I'm still angry, yeah, I may be. I may never trust someone. [Hook]. But you won't break me. You just make me stronger than I was. Before I met you, I'll bet you. I'll be just fine without you. And if I stumble, I won't crumble. I get back up and aah. And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you. Cause I'm stronger than I was"

survival (feat. liz rodrigues),"This is survival of the fittest. This is do or die. This is the winner takes it all. So take it all. Wasn't ready to being a millionaire. I was ill-prepared. I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there. From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends. It was 'bout busting raps. And standing for something, fuck an acronym. Cut the fucking act like you're happy. I'm fucking back again with another anthem. Why stop when it doesn't have to end?. It ain't over 'til I say it's over. Enough when I say enough. Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up. I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves. When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit. I salivated it. Weight is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie. Hold them bitches straighter up, up. Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff. Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos. I ain't deflate enough. Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt. This is survival of the fittest. This is do or die. This is the winner takes it all. So take it all. I can see the finish line with each line that I finish. I'm so close to my goals. I can almost pole vault. Over the goal post. And if I don't got enough in the tank. Maybe I can just siphon enough. To fill up this last can, man. Will I survive in this climate or what?. They said I was washed up. And got a blood bath. I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter. I can adjust. Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust. So floor's open if you'd like to discuss. Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut. What? Like I give a fuck. I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck. To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it. Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up. And if there should ever come a time. Where my life's in a rut. And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook. Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow. I'm stabbing myself. With a fucking knife in the gut. While I'm wiping my butt!. Cause I just shitted on the mic, and like getting cut. I get excited at the sight of my blood. You're in a fight with a nut. Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win. Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait. Let me remind you of what got me this far. Picture me quitting. Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut. It's survival of what?. This is survival of the fittest. This is do or die. This is the winner takes it all. So take it all. So take it all. So get your ideas, stack your ammo. But don't come unless you come to battle. I'm mad now jump in the saddle. This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit. Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this. Refuse to quit, fuse is lit. Can't diffuse the wick. I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit. Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth. It's all I know how to do. As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit. But my respect is overdue. I'm showing you the flow no one do. Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!. So there's nothing for me to fall back on. I know no other trades. So you'd better trade your fucking mics. In for some tool-box-es. Cause you'll never take my pride from me. It'll have to be pried from me. So pull out your pliers and your screwdri-vers. But I want you to doubt me. I don't want you to buh-lieve. Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed. And if you don't like me then fuck you!. Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof. Cause trust me. My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me. I can see why the fuck I disgust you. I must be a-llergic to failure. Cause everytime I come close to it. I just sneeze, I just go atchoo then achieve!. This is survival of the fittest. This is do or die. This is the winner takes it all. So take it all. So take it all"

"syllables (feat. jay-z, dr. dre and 50 cent)","[Eminem]. If we gotta dumb down our style and abc it. Then so be it. Cause nowadays these kids, jeez. Don't give a shit bout lyrics. All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it. Long as they can go to the club and get blitz. Pick up some chicks and get some digits. And the dj's playing them hits. Oh this my jam, this my sh-t. We don't know a word to a verse,. All we know is the chorus. Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us. And the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched. Cause we don't know anymore, what are hits. Is it the beat, is it the rap. Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap. And how do we adapt and get TRL votes. When 13 year olds control the remote. And Ashley's got a brand new nose. We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables. [Jay-z]. If the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat. Than I'm gon feature em and get rich. And let dre mix the shit and drive off in the range ro. Cause everywhere i go they love the bling bling flow. Bang bang look at the way my chain glow. The ring on my fing' cost jermaine a lot of dough, oh. The f-ck am I busting my brain for?. It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes 2 to tango. You call this a lame flow. You bought the shit. I guess you to blame too. I just found the angle. No more reality flow. I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show. Cock the mac 11 in front of hot 97. And call my publicist tell her we impressed heaven. No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet. So you want the chat room or the house of malibu Em?. Your emphasis is on the wrong syllable. [Dr Dre]. They said 30's the new 20. Funny, must mean 40's the new 30. Interesting cause ever since then it's been innocence. An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half. Of the shit coming out right now. It's all trash. The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed. Jay said it's his last and 50 and Em. Then what? Detox drops what we got then. So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do. Gambling everytime we put a record out. Just looking for that hook. [Eminem]. (wait Dre look). Shorty I love you. And you love me too. We were meant to be cause shorty. You love me. And I love you too. And I promise I'll be true to you. [50 Cent]. Go shorty, it's your birthday. You made it just in time to hear my wordplay. It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip o's. And run g for days used to see how I get hoes. I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe. I'm sick right into show, riding on lolo's. Puffing on coco, my bitch in manolo's. Don't f-ck with the dodo's, I sling for dumb hoes. I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke. You f-ck around, you could get your ass smoked. Look, it's not a game, me B, I ain't playing. Beep behind me player, so you here anyway. You don't hear what I'm saying. Me fin-nini-na. Fee-fi-dididee-yay. Just give me my check and I'll be on my way. Sunny bunny money and funny. You ain't even listening and I just took your money. [Stat quo]. There once was a time everywhere he turned. Shady aftermath was all ya heard. But they say 50 sang too much. And em got soft. And they say Dre just fell the f-ck off. Well f-ck the f-ck offs. All y'all eat soft, be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!. New syllables eat ball, ya f-cks off's. Your house, your bitch I'm getting sucked off. East, south, midwest, even up north. Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk. All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost. Catch me if you can, I'm running past while y'all walk. [Ca$hi$]. Shady made me for bringing it back. For the history of rap. It's gone with a snap, a sneer and a clap. What happened to just spittin about living in the muthaf-cking city you at. In the grimiest condition, I breath in drama. King mathers and cash me, that's freak karma. I'm everything, anything, you could never be. It's a hitting, rhyme in the month deep. I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind. I repeat every evil deed done of mine. No rest contest, contract to sign. By blood I'm in this squad for life. Hear out my wind pipes and I just chime. I'm the reason you guys won't say that line. I'm crazy renegade like Em and Jay-z. I'm Rosemary's baby. [eminem]. Shorty I love you. And you love me too. We were meant to be cause shorty. You love me. And I love you too. And I promise I'll be true to you. [talking]. It is not about lyrics anymore,. It is not about lyrics anymore. It's about a hot beat, a hot beat. It's about a hot beat, a hot beat. A hot hot hot beat. And a catchy hook. A hot hot hot beat. And a catchy hook. Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are. I don't care if you gotta rhyme smo, joe, toe and glow. Now get out there and sell some god-damn records. Now get out there and sell some god-damn records. Now get out there and sell some god-damn records. Now get out there and sell some god-damn records. Now get out there and sell some god-damn records"
symphony in h,"(Trecho). Don't ask me what's up with the hoes. I'm still working the kinks out. Love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin' out. And I ain't chillin now. I got an Oscar, I'm still a grouch. I use it as a doorstop, and the prop. For the broken leg for the couch. Yelawolf, Shady, Tony, touch Slaughterhouse. Yeah the swat team bout to break them flyswatters out. Go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out. Nice try, shorty what? We can window shop. The jewelry store. But Christ, for that price coulda bought a house. Besides only thing I ever had iced out. Was my heart since I started out. It's F. Y. I if ya ain't knowing. What go with you? Where? Nah ain't going. Oh wait, you want a date oh?. Well in that case ho it's June 8 oh. Kinda like Beethoven composin' a symphony of hate. So much hate woved into these raps. Shit I'm beginning to hate clothing. I hate overalls because they remind me of hoes. For christ sake theyre shaped like a H woah, and. You know what else starts with H, though?. Hockey, shit thought I had the place flowing. I hate to put you on ice but. You already had 3 periods in 60 minutes, great going. Plus you remind me of cocaine ho. You always in the mirror with your face off. I feel an urge to put you all in a line. And chop you with a razor blade, yo wait. I'm an a-hole, devil with a Halo. Hell yeah I nailed J-Lo, to the railroad. Say I won't, better hope you can stay afloat. When I take the wind out your sail boat. I ain't playing yo! Go for Shady don't kid yourself. Bitch, you aint even a baby goat"

talk 2 me,"[Jeezy]. I?m tired, I feel wired but yet I?m still inspired. To find somebody else for the job, tell me I?m fired. Really muthafuck what they say, I did my job yo. Hood nigga straight off the block, I beat the odds. Now you see a nigga, back to the wall. Now you exciting, now I?m done. Everything for you niggas but get indicted. Got niggas in the feds wishin I was still with ?em. Death penalty, go throw ?em in the ail with ?em. Rather die int he hands of the judge then former friends. Man this shit is like an ongoing movie, it never ends. Same nigga say that they would, love you forever. Niggas get the forecast and change just like the weather. Got me feeling like a whole brick, cut with some pain. From winter days yeah, they start of sunny and then it rains. And even after all these years, it?s still storming. You couldn?t of told ?em it wouldn?t be like this. You coulda warned ?em. [Eminem]. Somebody better explain, why my ears are ringing so loud. Someone has got something to say, grow some balls and. say it to my face. (Somebody talk to me) Ooooh Oh, Ooooh Oh. Somebody?s got a problem, I wanna know. Keep my name out ya muthafucking mouth. Somebody talk to me. [Freddie Gibbs]. Walking like I?m talking, play it like I see it. And I swear sometimes hear voices talking to me in my head. Some nights I slept for months, the living dead to get this bread. There?s two ways out this shit, a casket or the fucking fed. I rap cause one day I pray this might be my escape. Everyday I seal up these bags, seems like I?m sealing my fate. My momma worked at your gangsta, jumped off the porch. out the gate. But I can?t let my momma bury me, thats some shit she. can?t take. Most niggas hate when you come up and you doing. something constructive. Police to the politician, my whole city corrupted. Wanna convict me for a couple transactions that I conducted. And my homeboys just might snitch under pressure. So muthafuck ?em, it?s just me and my two nuts. And you can bet they gon hang. And bitch my resume gon? check out til I check out the game. Sometimes that ski mask on my skull it took effect on my brain. And I still didn?t tell the shit, I?m sick of telling you man. Somebody talk to ?em. [Eminem - Bridge]. Somebody talk to me. Somebody better explain, how my name?s ending up. in your mouth. Somebody talk to me. Got 2 seconds to talk, I want some answers right the fuck now. Somebody talk to me. Cause if it?s me that you?re talkin? about then I wanna know. Somebody talk to me. We almost past the point of being able to talk this shit out. [Eminem - Hook].

talkin' 2 myself (feat. kobe),"(Intro). Ayo, before I start this song man,. I just wanna thank everyone for being so patient. And bearing with me over the last couple years while. I figure this shit out. (Hook). Is anybody out there,. It feels like I'm talking to myself. No one seems to know my struggle,. And everything I come from. Can anybody hear me yeah,. I guess I keep talking to myself. Feels like I'm going insane,. Am I the one who's crazy. So why in the world do. I feel so alone. Nobody but me, I'm on my own. Is there anyone out there,. Who feels the way I feel. That there is and let me know so. I know that I'm not the only one. (Verse 1). I went away I guess that opened up some lanes. But there was no one who even knew. I was going through growing pains. Hatred was flowing through my veins,. on the verge of going insane. I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne. It's like I was jealous of him,. cause of the attention he was getting. I felt horrible about myself,. he was spitting and I wasn't. Anyone who was buzzing back then could of got it. Almost went at Kanye too,. God it feels like I'm going psychotic. Thank god that I didn't do it. I'd of had my ass handed to me, and I knew it. But proof isn't here. to see me through it. I'm in the booth popping another pill, tryna talk. myself into it. Are you stupid? You gon' start dissing people. for no reason. Especially when you can't. even write a decent punchline even. You're lying to yourself, you're slowing dying. You're denying,. your health is declining with your self esteem. You're crying out for help. (Hook). Is anybody out there,. It feels like I'm talking to myself. No one seems to know my struggle,. And everything I come from. Can anybody hear me yeah,. I guess I keep talking to myself. Feels like I'm going insane,. Am I the one who's crazy. So why in the world do I feel so alone. Nobody but me, I'm on my own. Is there anyone out there,. Who feels the way I feel. That there is and let me know so. I know that I'm not the only one. (Verse 2). Marshall, you're no longer the man,. that's a bitter pill to swallow. All I know is I'm wallowing,. self-loathing and hollow. Bottoms up on the pill bottle,. maybe I hit my bottom tomorrow. My sorrow echos in this hall though. But I must be talking to the wall though,. I don't see nobody else. (I guess I keep talking to myself). But all these other rappers suck. is all that I know. I've turned into a hater, I put up a false mavado. But Marshall is not an egomaniac,. that's not his motto. He's not a desperado, he's desperate,. his thoughts are bottled. Inside him, one foot on the brake,. one of the throttle. Falling asleep with writers block. in the parking lot of Mcdonalds. But instead of feeling sorry for yourself,. do something about it. Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded. You're powdered long enough,. It isn't them, it's you, you fucking baby. Quit worrying bout what they do and do. Shady, I'm fucking going crazy. (Hook). Is anybody out there,. It feels like I'm talking to myself. No one seems to know my struggle,. And everything I come from. Can anybody hear me yeah,. I guess I keep talking to myself. Feels like I'm going insane,. Am I the one who's crazy. So why in the world do I feel so alone. Nobody but me, I'm on my own. Is there anyone out there,. Who feels the way I feel. That there is and let me know so. I know that I'm not the only one. (Verse 3). So I picked myself up off the ground,. and fucking swam before I drowned. Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice,. advice this time around. It's different, them last 2 albums didn't count. Encore I was on drugs,. Relapse I was flushing 'em out. I've come to make it up to you,. now no more fucking around. I got something to prove to fans cause. I feel like I let 'em down. So please accept my apology,. I finally feel like I'm back to normal. I feel like me again,. let me formally re-introduce myself. To you for those of you who don't know. The new me's back to the old me,. and homie I don't show no. Signs of slowing or bowing,. I'm blowing up all over. My life is no longer a movie,. but the show ain't over homos. I'm back with a vengeance homie,. Weezy keep your head up. T.I. keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up. Don't let up, just keep slaying em. Rest in peace to Dj Am,. cause I know what this shit is like. I struggle with this shit every single day and I'm. (Hook). Is anybody out there,. It feels like I'm talking to myself. No one seems to know my struggle,. And everything I come from. Can anybody hear me yeah,. I guess I keep talking to myself. Feels like I'm going insane,. Am I the one who's crazy. So why in the world do I feel so alone. Nobody but me, I'm on my own. Is there anyone out there,. Who feels the way I feel. That there is and let me know so. I know that I'm not the only one. (Outro). So there it is, damn,. feels like I just woke up or something. Guess I just forgot who the fuck I was man. Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at,. it was never nothing personal. Just some shit that I was going through. And to the rest of you, I'm back!"
ten freaky girls,"I´m the da Shiki smoki´n da. Leaky leaky.. Ten freaky girls. inside the Chin Tiki.. Girl, When you see me. You better believe me.. This ain´t a game and pimpim´ ain´t easy,.

that's all she wrote,"[t. I]. Now I don't really care what you call me. Just as long as you dont call me rude. I bet they knew as soon as they saw me. ""goodnight its over with"" thats all she wrote. Streets like cold chicago. Aint nothing new i've seen it all before. But still I ball like no tomorrow. Goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote. All she wrote, all she wrote. I said it's over with thats all she wrote. All she wrote, all she wrote. Goodnight its over with that's all she wrote. [t. I verse 1]. Its stupid how I'm going on everybody knowing that. I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for. It. Eventually see they cant beat than with me they. Join. Others sworn under oath, or banished left. Completely scorn. You tell lies, get caught, n-gga kick rocks. You never did blend in with the big shots. On the fast track, aint no need for no pit stops. I just laugh at, n-gga wishing it was this hot. Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off. Better that than pissed on. I'm the jetsons you the flintstones. Catch me in the end zone. High stepping prime time. Thought you n-ggas been on. Aint no blocking my shine. Like my new air yeezy's, you can see me in the night time. I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting. Rhymes. So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time. While I get stupid paper, hey my dough aint in its right. Mind. (mind, mind). [chorus]. Now I don't really care what you call me. Just as long as you dont call me rude. I bet they knew as soon as they saw me. ""goodnight its over with"" thats all she wrote. Streets like cold chicago. Aint nothing new i've seen it all before. But still I ball like no tomorrow. Goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote. [eminem -verse 2]. Your staring straight into a barrel of hate. Terrible fate. Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape. Cupid shot his arrow and missed. Wait sarah you're late, your train left. Mascara and egg smeared on your face. Nights over goodbye, hoe. I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut aint nothing to cry over. Never shoulda' came within range of my rover. Shoulda' known I was trouble soon as I rolled up. Any chick who's coming up after I blind fold her. She still comes back to my crib. Must want me to mess with her mind hold up. She must've took me for some high roller. But I wont buy her a soda. Unless it's rock n' roll cola. Buy u a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on. My shoulder. If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for. Ya. Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling. 5 molars. You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly. So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy you're already bi-polar. [Chorus 2 - eminem]. Now I don't really care what you call me. You can even call me cold. These bitches know as soon as they saw me. Its never me to get the privilege to know. I roll like a desperado. Now I never know where I'm gonna go. Still I ball like there's no tomorrow. Until its over and its all she wrote. [Verse 3: T. I.]. The credit roller, curatin closer, movie over with. But don't get mad at me. Go blame the chick who wrote this shit. Yeah life is sure a bitch. But she know I'm rich. That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick. Here I go again. I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in. Peso, euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon be broke again. See me posted in anything, wearing any chain. Never gon' see me tote in anything. All you gon' see is BANG!. Its so nice where I kick it. Hate you never get to visit. Yeah I'm on another level. But you niggas still can get it. Its all over before you finish. Sorry bro this road we end it. Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business. [Verse 4: Eminem]. Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP. And each one thinks ""Say this shit"". Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief. I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own. medicine. Let em get a good taste of it. I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now. But in case you didn't. Imma stick this whole pad. full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it. Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it. So I pace this shit a little bit quicker. That clock i'm racing in doubling time it. But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth. of the time. It may take you pricks to catch on. While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong. Man I still say K-mart like theres an apostrophe ""S"" on it dog. And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess. I'm wrong. But if you gon tell me that the A&W aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the ""F"" on dawg. [Bridge: T. I.]. And on my throne i remain, all alone in my lane. I'm as strong as they came. They were gone fo' they came. Now, I don't wanna hang, I slapped hands with the rap gods. They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why. [Eminem]. Now I don't really care what you call me. You can even call me cold. [T. I]. I bet the knew as soon as they saw me. ""Goodnight its over with"" thats all she wrote. [Eminem]. I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go. [T. I. & Eminem]. But still I ball like no tomorrow. ""Goodnight its over with"" thats all she wrote. All she wrote, all she wrote. I said ""it's over with"" thats all she wrote. All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote. ""Goodnight its over with"" thats all she wrote"
the anthem,"-RZA intro from ""Airwaves""-. [King Tech]. One two, one two. We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all. Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!. [RZA]. Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled. Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass. Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you. You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box. Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block. One stopped, parks pops his truA FANCY A SHAG WEE BURNERS. [Tech N9NE]. When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up. Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned. Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin. Look around, your town is crumblin. This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless. On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow. Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper. Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper. Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo. Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter. Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed. Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9NE's filled"". [Eminem]. This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out. Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?). Climped out of a nice house,. through the front window and heard this guy shout. ""Hey that's my couch, bitch!"". Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout. While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds. And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible. Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down. You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape. I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved. And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys. Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject. [Xzibit]. Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold. Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul. Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll. Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold. Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up. Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up. The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room. Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon. [Pharoahe Monch]. Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush. From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims. As horrid as Borris Kolaf was. When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh. So the head won't fall off, hauled-off. Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked. Why did he have to die like cast metal?. O, huh, C now like Omar Credle. We pone pedal at a high resolution. On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution. *DJ Revolution scratches*. [Kool G Rap]. I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway. Step away, wet and spray, rep the day. Who over debt to pay get swept away. Across the whole board like checker play. When I blaze your whole sect' arrays. Wake-Up Show for those slept away. Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray. DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK. Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'. Until the head of jake investigate. [Jayo Felony]. What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it. Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do?. Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it. I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!. [Chino XL]. Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round. Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown. Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk. What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought. The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry. For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me. Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all. Wit style filed for sexual harrassment like Tisha Camp-bell. You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy. I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey. Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'. You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg. I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway & Tech. My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon. I'm Chino X, bring KRS in. [KRS-One]. De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway. Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set. As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat. Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt. You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet. But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech. They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect. Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do. I'll be back but for now just sackle!. FRESH, FOR NINETY-NINE YOU SUCKAS!!!."
the apple,"(eminem). I'm a little nutty and i know it but if you go back. And take a look at my history. You will see that i'm not the only one that's off his rocker, there were many before me. I was always there with a black sheet, with a feeling, ""what a bad seed i grow to be."". But if you take a look at us now, you'll see that the apple didn't fall too far from the tree. (verse 1). Haha, haha, haha, haha. Alright look, i'mma tell you the story from my side. Maybe you'll understand, check it out. You done witnessed unexplainable shit. Too insane to explain,. People run from what theyy just don't get. Maybe shady should of just hit 'em with a little bit. Did i speak too soon, should i have spoon fed 'em it. But i was just so eager, to prove i was even. Worth being in the same league or the room. Of the people of whom i was in. Everynow and then, i look up like i was seekin' approval. Was it because of the pigment on my skin. Or was it the figment of my imagination. Maybe it bothered me more then it did them. Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then. But to me it was,. See what it was, was i had developed a complex from being judged. Proof spit his verse, so i'm next. Let's see who busts(?), i'm in the boothes starin' back to see who's (???). I get a reaction from usually the first one. Was from proof and the rest of the crew backed him up. And no one lied to each other. Cause none of us had deals, it was real. We just wanted tickets for that meal. (chorus). Sometimes i feel like it's just me. Sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy. But take a look at my family. Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree. I said.... Sometimes i feel like it's just me. Sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy. But take a look at my family. Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree. (verse 2). Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg. Cause she said that i had a baby sister. Who fell outta the window. I was too young to remember. Kansas city projects, i was like 5-6. And how come, i don't remember malcolm, isaac, and boogy(?). If it was the projects in missouri. Cause those were my best friends, until isaac. Took my tricycle, and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back. And ended up gettin' jumped, and cut in the cut(?). With a switch and 70 some stitches. Wishes, to this day, when my mother still tries to show me. Some more fake pictures, of a fictitious little sister. Who never existed. And this is why part of my life is so twisted. But i can never be as sick as that bitch is. And by the way that picture is one of my relatives. (chorus). Sometimes i feel like it's just me. Sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy. But take a look at my family. Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree. I said.... Sometimes i feel like it's just me. Sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy. But take a look at my family. Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree. (verse 3). You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain. To see why everything i say is so insane. What's different about my brain. That seperates me, from other players in this game. On the surface it may seem like a scheme. Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy. But that's the last thing i need, is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me. And i am not a g, never claimed to be,. I gave my best to cashis, this whole p don't need 'em more than me. But will it see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef. But if it comes our way.... What do we turn the other cheek? Come on.... (chorus). Sometimes i feel like it's just me. Sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy. But take a look at my family. Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree. I said.... Sometimes i feel like it's just me. Sometimes i feel like i'm goin' crazy. But take a look at my family. Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree. (outro). Ha, yeah. And i'm the crazy one right?. Whatever! Then let me be the crazy one!. (bunch of baby lip hitting shit). Haha. Cookooo (like a tweety bird). Cookooo. Tweeet (he's predicting the creation of twitter right here....). Haha. And angelina jolie is just another ho. And brad is a sucka? because once i fuck her. She wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby. You know what i say? No. You better save some of them kids from madonna. She needs all the publicity she can get. You want a shady? Well, you got it, man. I ain?t apologizin? for shit.. I?m a goat. And i don?t mean to gloat. But i know what i know and i know what you think. And these magazines?ll never put it in ink. Because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?. And for those of y?all who don?t know what a goat is. It means the greatest of all time. And i consider myself one of those. So thank you very much, here it goes!"
the backroom freestyle (feat. slaughterhouse),"Yo, T. What?. Get in the backroom. And speak the truth to the young youth!. Hey, ' don't leave home without your cars. But this is hip hop, so don't leave home without your balls. And for some of these rap start, that's just too bad. You can't bring out the balls that you ain't never had!. It's Eminem, it's Slaughterhouse. Yeah, you know we're the truth. And the game and all the audiences, we close the booth!. Yes, indeed, original, speak the replacement cause. The back room will never be what the basement was!. Yeah, I'm the realest mother** that I know. Wasn't always the case, guess you figured I had to grow. I do it for the love, I don't do it for the dough. But I know these sucker figures well, so they keep me on my toes. What that is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for. And the painkillers didn't murder pain, they gave me more!. These friends on my head, now they say they want to hold you. I grew up mature, you all could see that this an old joke!. Want to see me lose every battle with depression. No matter what it do to me, no matter my regression. They want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start. Want to cut the beat off soon as I let 'em in my heart!. I'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while. Sending unsolicited bitch... to' shit. Was so high I lost track of my ways. Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age. The way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase?. How you trife when I gave you life, you was lacking in wage!. You don't want say hi or speak to me. Bet you making 200 dollars by weekly. Try to help the world out, bring some reparation. And forget being humble in a state of desperation. Ain't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation. And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation!. I love you but its best we stay apart, segregation. And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication. Trust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe. It would kill us all slow. One reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know!. Hey, hey!. Ya, it's Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat. Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's gold teeth. Best rapper alive and you know me. The most distinguished shooter. That's coming up out of the D since Joe D. I take mines at lead point. At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove. In a razor inside a fed joint, uh. Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died. Only fear I have is hear world star being yelled from my blind side. Don't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight. But these days I'm more like a lyrical artist. I'm outlining everybody in chalk white. The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse. The same blueprint, your idolizing. You're trying to jump fast, that's foolish. If you're my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license. That's plain stupid, your boys a star. Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar. Its ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car. And now it's back and forth. the black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore. And Lord Jamar, first we defying the odds. We not a group, we more like a circular firing squad!. This not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop. We killed the ' two times already. What you gonna give us an award?. But we won't stop for shutting down the internet. Now tell your momma how I tell Rihanna, 'we ain't finished yet! '. Yo, yo. When we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters. Best spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members. Waving that shady flag, navy jag, matching the' fit. With the polo brief showing due to the lazy sag. I'm in a crazy kind of place. I got this thing right on my waist. That'll leave tears on your baby momma's face, so chill!. I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist. That'll leave kids on your baby momma's face for real!. The flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules. Your cap just started snapping. My starter caps was snapping when cross color was cracking. And my cane was half full. With the half moon park, hope you rap dudes smart. Don't piss me off like the bathroom mop. You don't want it with me!. If I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free. So save your jabs its way better. If I start throwing jabs. I'm talking Zabs first three round against May weather. Yeah I'm a crook from the brook that mastered how'. Shook turned notebook, broke cook, I'm so dope look. Bring the beat back with no hook just bars. Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop. Make 'em open up their bras, move G strings like guitars. That's nothing, that's something light like wrestling at the bar!. Y. A. O. W. A, if y'all ain't saying yaowa by now you got nothing to say. This like NWO vs NWA. y'all like the rockers verse the Roc full of nothing but J-s!. Check the rocks its nothing for gazing. But don't get stupid, my ' clique will throw shots for a couple of days. Make it horny when we out. 'horror, y'all don't want it with the house!. Yo, yo, slaughter season, y'all the reason. Real dudes I'm bringing some mo in. Like a Polynesian. Sick with the llama squeezing. Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing. Got your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne. You was Bob and weaving. Still getting hit till your no's is '. They set you deep in your coffin sleeping. I'm gone off the deep end. I'm a wolf, this industry my sheep skin. I'm out here hunting with my ink pen. I'm living like a kingpin!. Doing it for my g's in the pen. Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin. You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers. I'm iron mike, I don't like busters. You looking for 'em fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur. You got the right brothers, no bright jeans, no bright colors, no!. I'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted. Islamic Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen!. I back you in I dodge 'em in it. Like MC8 in a L. A. hat. These rappers straight trying dodge a menace. I'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis. Brothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants. Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens. I guess that era's over man, hold on!. I'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at 'em. I give 'em different patterns. They didn't phantom, they're stealing my styles!. Before me you didn't have 'em. You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam. Stab 'em in the abdomen when its crunch time. I truly flip like May weather pissed of at a movie script. Too many punch lines!. Family I'm amongst mine!. I keep the peace like a monks mind. 'your favorite barber. Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara. Don't stop what we doing. When you see L. A. your team will be ruined!. This game need a new villain. I'm the kind to murder you on vine. Uh, kill 'em!. Ladies and gentleman, now introducing. The man beneath the legend. Mr. Marshall man, aka, Slim Shady!. Yo! Role model?. I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of coke products. If she don't swallow, and' till the bumper hit the throttle. While I'm trying hit the pot holes. I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds!. Any' end up horizontal getting fondle. I don't cuddle, I don't coddle!. Only motto that I follow. Is any thing I drive, whether its a Navajo or a Tahoe. It's got a ho in it, nah ho. I don't got no freaking bronco!. You looking for a buck, get a horse, '. I got a rusty Hondo with some bondo. And a box of condoms you little blond '. Fuck me? fuck you too!. Like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono. And I ain't from this planet so '. I'm intolerable, too volatile. Screw it! I don't got too make honor roll. To be on a roll, I don't know much. What I do know I do it pronto, though!. So knock it off, all these knock off me's. The last thing the world needs is another me. But if you think this is part two. To recovery or love the way you lie part twelve. Or something heart felt, you bout to make a discovery. Like you found Christopher Columbus' compass. And dumb it down for you dumb fucks, so suck it. I took your best punch line like a punch in the stomach. That punctured a lung punk and I'm still functioning from it. Chump it was nothing, now watch while I fucking one up it and toot my own horn. Once I think its something to trump it. And I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off. Like the trunk of an elephant to triumphant. Return of the ether spitting retard, reborn. But chances of you having another re-birth, slim to none. Like a skinny Mother Theresa. Give a fuck if its Easter. So kiss my '. Cause that's the only thing ill turn the other cheek for!"

"the cypher (with mos def, and black thought)","[Verse 1: Mos Def]. For sinners saints and scramblers and gamblers. And dirty money handlers, dignitaries and champions, narcotic traffickers. Talented number runners and racketers. Stars of stage, page and cameras, slang swingers and swaggerers. Double barrels and Derringers, automatics and miracles. Europe Asia and Africa, all the time in America. Atlantic, Ashland, Alblemarle to Albany. Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave, Bergen Street. Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave to Clarendon. Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress. And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant. The livest high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus. Stationed live and direct, Medina mastermind set. Ya can't lock my set now lock off, cool. Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths. And the Sun, Moon and stars, Furthermore born knowledge go hard. [Verse 2: Black Thought]. Remix, rising up outta the flames like a phoenix. Training to carry the weight of my brain like a genius. Knowing I'm sowing them seeds let's see whose thumb is the greenest. If I said it I mean it and did it because I need it. Eat sleep it and eat it, write it down and then read it. Asphalt to the cement, your trash talk is deleted. Blastoff, I lay them out like a Tempurpedic. Black Thought, I told you I'mma win eventually. This unsung, underrated, under appreciated. The one them underachievers had underestimated. Finally graduated from something that's so hated. To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it. Face it, I keep doing it well, doing it (?). Is do it yourself, doing it below the radar. We doing it stealth, doing it again. For Illadelph and who else? But check it out. Y'all see him on a job, see my eyes focused where the prize be. I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney. The difference is I give it everything inside me. Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me. Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny. Swimming with them big whites now is where you'll find me. Funny how it break right down but never mind me. I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining. Rock rolla bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman. [Verse 3: Eminem]. Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine. You're just hoping you don't get roped for your throat get choked anything. Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything. Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding. I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with a switch. And stitch you a the same time before you can flinch to it. My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it. You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it. I'm not a baller but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar. That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet. Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua. Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you mama. It's like I'm off the bomba when I bring the fuckin' drama. Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer. I'm a fuckin' cross between Osama Dahmer Obama and Dalai Lama. So Miley I'm a knight in shining armor. Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture. Of my genitalia with a note saying bitch I can't wait to nail ya. Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya. That's him in the sheep's clothes, he just shaved his hair off Cecilia"
the kids,"(Teacher Sings) And everyone should get along... Ok children quiet down, quiet down. Children i'd like to introduce your new substitute teacher for the day. His name is Mr. Shady. Children quite down please. Brian don't throw that.. (SHUT UP!). Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pnumonia. (HE'S GOT AIDS!) Good luck Mr. Shady.... (Verse 1-Eminem). Hi there little boys and girls. (FUCK YOU!) Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels. But first, i'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?). Say Hi Bob, (""Hi Bob"") Bob's 30 and still lives with his Mom. and he don't got a job Cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot. But his 12 year old brother looks up to him awful lot.. And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot. and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock. When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog. He drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the choppin block.. And even if they escape and got the cops. The ladies would be so afraid, they would drop the charge. Till one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job. When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk. But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off. But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker.. Crazier than Slim Shady is off the locker. You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor. He grabbed Stace by the leg, he chopped it off her. And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her. But ever since the day Stacey went off the wander. They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner. And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana,. And what it might do to you. So see if the squirrels want it, cause it's bad for you. (Chorus) See children, drugs are bad. And ff you don't believe me, ask ya Dad. And If you don't believe him, ask ya Mom. She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time. So kids say no to drugs. So you don't act like everyone else does. And there's really nothing else to say. Drugs are just bad mmm k.... (Verse 2-Eminem). My penis is the size of a peanut, Have you seen it?. Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?). Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?. Extacy is the worst drug in the world. If someone offers it to you, don't do it. Kids, 2 hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid. And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back. So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in ya back. Meet Zack, 21 years old. After hanging around with some friends at a Frat party he gets bold,. and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys. And peer pressure will win everytime you try to fight it. Suddenly, he starts to convulse. And his pulse goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes go back in his skull. His back starts ta look like the McDonald's Arches. He's on Donald's carpet, laying horizontal barfin'. And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him. ""Hey Adam, Zack is a jackass, look at him"". So they took it to, so they think it's funny. So their laughin' at basically nothing. Except maybe wastin' their money. Meanwhile, Zack's in a coma, the action is over. And his back and his shoulders, hunched up like he was practicin' Yoga. And that's the story of Zack, the extacy maniac. So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you. (Repeat chorus). (Verse 3-Eminem) Last but not least,. One of the most humungous problems among young people today,. is fungus. It grows from cow manure,. They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up,. and you put it right in ya mouth and chew it...Yum Yum. Then you start to see some dumb stuff. And everything slows down when you eat some, of ...'em.... And sometimes you see things that aren't there. (Like what?) Like fat woman in g-strings with orange hair. (Mr. Shady what's a g-string?). It's worn, Claire! Women stick them up their behind, and go out and wear 'em. (Huh?). And if you swallow too much of the magic mushroom. Whoops, did i say magic mushroom, i meant fungus. Ya tongue gets all swolled up like a cow's tongue. (How come?) Cause it comes from a cow's dump (Oh). See drugs are bad, it's a common fact. But your Mom and Dad know that's all i'm good at. (Ert) But don't be me,. cause if ya grow up and ya go and OD. They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee. And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault. So don't do drugs, and do exactly as i don't,. cause I'm bad for you. (Repeat chorus). (Teacher & Classmates) Come on children, clap along. (SHUT UP!) Sing along children (SUCK MY MOTHERFUCKING DICK!) Drugs are just bad,. drugs are just bad (SOUTH PARK IS GONNA SUE ME) So don't do drugs,. so there'll be more for me (GOD DAMNIT! MUSHROOMS KILLED KENNY). (Pltttt OOOO *fart noises*) la la la la!."

Hit you with 12 shots in mid-air and four more on the way down. as eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground. You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!). No pun intended, just hop out of your whip. and leave it un-attended before I whip out this gun and end it. Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute. Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it. Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it. Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged. Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged. like cavewomen, while I'm gravediggin with Marilyn Man'. Chorus: Mr. Eon, Eminem. If you got a bowl of hash better cash it. You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit. And if you spittin wack shit on the microphone. I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'ma detach it. So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it. You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit. I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid. Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it. [Mr. Eon]. Yo yo, ""Eon's wack now,"" how you think that?. Couldn't get on my record if you were shrink rap (can I get a rhyme?). Desecrate a crate with these rhymes I be totin. Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem. I got stupid mucus from these loose lips. My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak. to the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat. Let's go back in time and steal my whole steez. The Quickening, did a bris at the christening. I'm exercisin, doing liftings and twistings. Instinct's the nicest, I keep tellin you. What the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin you?. [Eminem]. (Here - buy this) I'm e-mailin you, at the wrong website. and mispellin you, prank you and put the fear of hell in you. Escaped Bellevue, stuffed the nurse in a purse. Disperse like I added too many words in a verse. Slim Shady, a perverted version of birth. Drivin off, leaving a murdered virgin at church. The first person who searchin the earth for the motherfucker. that pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first. (Kill his ass) Get thrown curves, and hit with your own words. Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves. And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up. I'm takin off both shoes and stickin each middle toe up. (Fuck y'all!!!!). Chorus. [Eminem]. Any disease out there I'm willin to catch it.... Slim Shady.... All praises to The High & Mighty. Outro: scratches by DJ Mighty Mi. ""Slim Shady"", ""naughty rotten rhymer"". ""Mr. Eon"", ""illest rhyme dropper"". ""Slim Shady"", ""naughty rotten rhymer"". ""Mr. Eon"", ""illest rhyme dropper"". ""Slim Shady"".

the more you put me through,"[chorus]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's making me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Because you love me and I love you more. [verse 1]. It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the. same shit. We say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it. for us. It's lust, 'cuz neither one of us trusts each other so. we fuck. 'till we bust, 'till cuss each other out, we know what. it's about. Shout 'till I throw you out the house, you throw me out. the house. I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth, we. fist fight. 'till we turn this mother out and apologize after,. laughter. Pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again. And it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you. There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do 'cuz. [chorus]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's making me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Because you love me and I love you more. [verse 2]. 'Cuz I hate you, do you hate me?. Good, 'cuz you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry. It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you. on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you. You FUCK other people and I FUCK other people. You're a SLUT, but i'm equal, i'm a MUTT, we're both. evilin our ways. but neither one of us would ever admit it. 'Cuz one of us would have one up on the other so forget. it. We can make accusations, people spread rumours. But they ain't got proof, 'till they do, it's just the. two of us. You and me, 'cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me. But you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed. If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would. 'Cuz the sex is too damn good, if I ran, who would I run. to. that would be this soft and warm? So it's off and on. Usually more off then on but at least we know that we. Share this common bond, you're the only one I can fuck. without a condom on, I hope the only reason that I cope. Is 'cuz if that faggot busts then I can bust in that,. and that's why. [chorus]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's making me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Because you love me and I love you more. [verse 3]. I can never understand it, that's why I don't try. From junior high until we both die, you silly hoe why. must we try. Is it really so rough that we must always call each. other's Billy Goat's Gruff. Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs. We're lying to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah. 'Cuz we truly love each other, that's why we always fight. And all we do is shove each other every other fuckin'. night. And it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this pinned up. rage. We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged. By someone else, we both been someone else's someone else. The problem is neither one wants help, it's an addiction. And it can't be fixed, our family's mixed up. There's a baby sister in the mix and it hurts 'cuz the. pieces to the puzzle don't fit. And anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit. And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the. time on every song. Every lyric and every rhyme, all the hoopla, all of the. woopty woo. What you put me through, fuckin' woopty do. But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love. You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't. screw up. This time, 'cuz this time girl i'm tellin you what. You do it again and i'm fuckin' you up 'cuz no matter. [chorus 2]. What you say, what you do. I'ma hunt you down 'till I find you. No matter where you run, i'll be right there. Right behind you in your nightmares. So much for them flowers, and the candy. All the times that you threw it back at me. Told me you hate me, you 'gon hate me more. When you find out you can't escape me, whore. [chorus]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's making me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Because you love me and I love you more"
the osama bin laden (diss),"Spoken: Eminem as Bin Laden]. Oh Dr Dre. Or should I say Dr Gay. You are very bad man, you diss the wrong motherfucker. You think Osama won't diss you black biaatch. [verse 1:]. Things just ain't the same for Osama. Since the World Trade Bombings. And the Pentagon got the world calling. Me to kill all of congress, like... [blurred]. The Strangest things can happen to an Afghan. When people get wrapped up in Islam and Allah. Then some shiteaters fly planes and wreak havoc. Then go drop the blame on Bin Laden. Now I got a faggot-ass rapper attacking me. With this gangsta rap, like I'm not gonna battle. Dr Dre? The man wasn't done shit since NWA. And gave Eazy-E AIDS. Don't make shoot night on your fat ass. You homofuck, you ain't the only one goin' platinum. Osama Bin Laden, keeping it gangsta. Fuck Dr Dre, I'm the Aftermath. [Chorus:]. Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before. People I used to know just don't know me no more. And everywhere that I go, I got people I know. Who've got people they know, so I suggest you lay low. [verse 2:]. Oh Dr Dre look at you, you fool. I use your own rap against you, and I'm better. Lick my balls, til they are dry. Sorry... come again. Things just ain't the same for Bin Laden. This planet hates me more than Michael Jackson. Hating on the Taliban for keeping me captive. Threatening to find my little cave and blast it. Now I've got to worry about this wannabe gansta. Who pays other rappers to write his wack shit. Everyone knows that your beats are helped man. And you'll never blow by yourself man. Sorry, you'd blow... blow cocks. Use the hole as a straw and blow sperm out your nostrils. I don't give a hurried fuck, call Slim Shady. Snoop Dogg, D. O. C, Wren and Jay-Z. To write a verse, fuck I'll do it for ya. You still lick dick, this is Booshu Babara. Do you know who, do you know what, do you know who?. Let's keep this between me and you. [Chorus]. Osama. Osama. OOsama. O-o-o-osama. Bitch"
the re-up,"""The Re-Up"". (feat. 50 Cent). [Intro - Eminem]. [Beatboxing] Yeah, we should do something like that.... [Chorus - 50 Cent]. Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!. Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!. Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!. Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!. [Verse 1 - Eminem]. There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this. And it's the, most sinister duo in the business. Once again its the, illest and realest killas. The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice. Drop them zeros and get with these heroes. Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's. Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners. Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's. Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us. Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us. Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is. The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is. And as sick as his music is, or was, still is. Whatever, forever, he will be the illest. To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next. He's already reconciled with his ex [reversed], a chainsaw and an axe. Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck. While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax. I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back. The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack. Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad. I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically. He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that. I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track. In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap. I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that. Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass. I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass. [Verse 2 - 50 Cent]. Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, to clean parts, to shitty parts,. My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tell you're ass apart!. A game in this game, crush a motherfuckers free start,. Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch,. Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick,. Teflon wrapped on, case I get clapped on,. D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home,. Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows,. You rocking wit the kid to spit sicker sick flows,. I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it,. Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it,. E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay,. Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down,. I smile through summan' fowl, and watch my money pile,. I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats,. I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!. [Hook - 50 Cent (Eminem)]. Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!. Boom boom chuck, Go 'head, funky funk up!. Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!. Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!. Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!. Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up!. Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!.

They first were divorced. Throwing her over furniture (aah). It's the return of the. ""ah wait, no wait, you're kidding. He didn't just say what I think he did. Did he? "". And Dr. Dre said. Nothing you idiots, Dr Dre's dead. He's locked in my bassment. Feminist women love eminem. Chicka chicka chicka slim shady. ""I'm sick of him, look at him. Walkin around, grabbin his you know what.

And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss. And that's the message that we deliver to little kids. And expect them not to know. what a woman's clitoris is. Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is. By the time they hit 4th grade. They got the discovery channel, dont they?. We ain't nothing but mammals. Well, some of us cannibals. Who cut other people open like cantelopes. But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes. Then there's no reason that a man. And another man can't elope. But if you feel like I feel.

You joke about with your friends inside you livin' room. The only difference is I got the balls to say it. In front of ya'll and I aint gotta be false or sugar coated at all. I just get on the mic and spit it. And whether you like to admit it (riip). I just shitted it better than 90 you rappers out can. Then you wonder how can. Kids eat up these albums. Like valiums. It's funny, cause at the rate I'm going. When I'm thirty. I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting. Pinchin nurses asses. When I'm jackin off with jergen's. And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of viagra. Isn't working. In every single person there's a slim shady lurkin. He could be workin at burger king. Spittin on your onion rings.

the ringer,"Yeah, (Illa). Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts. see where this takes me. 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world. in the fuckin' face right now, yeah!. Let me explain just how to make greatness. Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down. Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout. To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows. If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brr). Full magazine could take Staples out. Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account. But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown. Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch. I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'. My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are. To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view. You mention me, millions of views. attention in news. I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you. Billions of views, your ten cents are two. Skim through the music to give shit reviews. To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse. Don't get misconstrued, business as us'. Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do. Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get. What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to. Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow. Everyone copies though? Probably no. Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adiós. I can see why people like Lil Yachty. but not me though. Not even dissin', it just ain't for me. All I am simply is just an MC. Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (get it). Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean. Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably. Shake the world up if it were up to me. Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill. I should eat a pill, probably I will. Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death. I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath. Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed. Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, spelled). Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick. With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip. Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench. While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch. Like vice-president Mike Pence. Back up on my shit in a sidekick. as I lay it on a spike strip. These are things that I'd rather do. than hear you on a mic. Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and. Jesus Christ, man, how many times is. Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!). You won't ever see Em icy. But as cold as I get on the M-I-C. I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze. And your skull might split. like I passed you upside it. Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah). Turn down for what?. I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up!. 'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut. Now when it doesn't matter what caliber. I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks. You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck. Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?. And now he wants to take it out on us. "" (oouu). But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy. Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study. It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me. I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that. I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry. Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing). So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'. Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne. I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name. I'm fed up with bein' humble. And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings. I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach. I heard your mumblin', but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo. The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to. What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?. I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two. And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner. If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner. I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it. I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper. You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's. But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse. you better go get Revival. But y'all are actin' like I tried. to serve you up a slider. Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned. And you woulda bought it. But sayin' I no longer got it. 'Cause you missed a line and never caught it. 'Cause it went over your head. because you're too stupid to get it. 'Cause you're mentally retarded. but pretend to be the smartest. With your expertise and knowledge. but you'll never be an artist. And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless. What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest. Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it. Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic. With a bottle full of malt liquor. But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer. The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom. If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet. I don't see why y'all even started with me. I get in beefs, my enemies die. I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased. I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'. Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink. I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats. I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze. ""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage. The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach! "". Shout to all my colorblind people. Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green. Aquamarine, or you think water is pink. ""Dawg, that's a date. "" ""Looks like an olive to me. "". ""Look, there's an apple! "" ""No, it's not, it's a peach! "". So finger-bang, Pootie Tang. Burger Kang, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang. Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say. Give me Donkey of the Day. What a way for 2018 to get underway. But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say. Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah). Invite 'em in like a One A Day. I'm not done (preach). 'Cause I feel like the beast of burden. That line in the sand, was it even worth it?. 'Cause the way I see people turning's. Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose. I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds. And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word. Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict. Or still yet to be determined?. 'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship. But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it. And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent. Sold the dream to that he's deserted. But I think it's workin'. These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous. And he's too scurred to answer me with words. 'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered. But I know at least he's heard it. 'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service. To meet in person to see. if I really think of hurtin' him. Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists. I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"". But my beef is more media journalists. (Hold up, hold up, hold up…). I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist. Can get a mouthful of flesh. And yes, I mean eating a penis. 'Cause they been pannin' my album to death. So I been givin' the media fingers. Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh. But they been puttin' me through the wringer. So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press. But I just took this beat to the cleaners"
the sauce,"[Eminem]. It's all bad now man, it's all bad. Cuz y'all done FUCKED up now. YEA! Ha ha, new shit, aiyyo. I just want the whole world to know. That I did not start this, but I will finish it. Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was. If you could spit, then you could spit. That's it, that's what it was. Back when, motherfuckers was straight backpackin'. Cipherin', fightin' for life in this raft. For the mic to get past, and you psyched and you gasped. Then you hype, cuz you last. And you might whoop some ass. If you lost, then you lost. Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it. When the Unsigned Hype column in The Source was like. The only source of life. When the mics used to mean something, a four was like. You were the shit, now it's like the least you get. Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit. Four and a half or five. Means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas, or Benzino. Shit I don't even think you realize. You're playing with motherfuckers' lives. I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic. Probably cuz I was on it. Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide. I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin breath to get a five. Shit I was right, I'da fuckin died already tryin. I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why. You let that bitch give me that bullshit review. I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew. You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too. *Hock spit*, fuck a relationship we through. No more Source for street cred, them days is dead. Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays' head. Every issue there's an eight page Made Men spread. Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head. That I am not afraid of this fuckin waste of lead. On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple. So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed. This old G's about to get smoked like rolled weed. You don't know me or my motherfucking mother. You motherfucking punk. Put me on your fuckin cover just to sell your little. Sell-out mag, I ain't mad, I feel bad. Here's an ad, here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad. You wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about, yea?. Let's talk about how you're puttin your own son out there. To try to eat off him because you missed your boat. You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old. No wonder you're sore now, lordy you're bored now. I'm pushing thirty, you're kickin forty's door down. Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me. All you do is cheat me out of Quotables. But you know that you'll always see me. On your TV, cuz you've got to stay up 'til. Three in the morning to see your video played once on BET. So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yea. So on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks. We'll never fold or hold back, just know that. Benzino's wack, no matter how many times I say his name. He'll never blow jack. You're better off tryin to bring RSO back. Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back. It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion. So half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston. Bullyin and bossin Dave like a slave. They completely brainwashed him and forced him to stay. Locked in his own office. Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York. And it's pitiful, cuz I would have never said shit if you'da. Kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?. Hit it Clue, spit it Slay, new shit, exclusive. Yo Lantern, yo Who Kid, you know what to do with this. Use it, I'm through, this is stupid. I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this. And who you callin a bitch... bitch?."
the showdown,"The Wild.. Gotham. The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}. Ha ha, riiiiide... [Dr. Dre]. All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun. I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one. Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now. I'ma show you how real cowboys get down. I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold. I got a {blunt} rolled. Feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold. It's time to reload this old .45 colt. The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty. Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty. It's passed noon, he should be here soon. Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon. All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs. Sounds like a thousand wolves. I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze. I pose like a poster, he's closer than close. I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty. but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early. And just when I went to fill him with hot lead. I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said. [Eminem]. You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again. but I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge?. Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you. I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you... Chorus: {unknown singer}. You ride like a cowboy toward the sun. And life ain't fun, when you're on the run. Got your gold and you got your gun. But life as an outlaw just begun. Got your shotgun by your side. Got your horse and you got your pride. You ride til there ain't no place to hide. It's sad cause the bad guys always die. [Dr. Dre] + (Eminem). He was ""Shady,"" I seen by the look on his face. He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight. Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain. My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said. (You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}. I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs. We both drew at the same time and stood stunned. (Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want). I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot. So what we gon' do, it's on you. (Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?). The Chronic!. (Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two). (And plus I know who's got it). Who?. (Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two). Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle. Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle. We rolled two miles until we hit the spot. An old ghost town that everybody forgot. A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot. Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot). (Eminem). This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless. He's goin around sayin he took the game from us. [Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin]. But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach. He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs. Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads. Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs. And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps. [Dr. Dre]. I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers. Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging. I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a ""G Thang,"". and a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin"". I said ""It's Dre's Day,"" and started to spray. Against 1800, he pulls a AK. Hollow tips started flyin every which way. (Eminem). That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge. I fired the first shot, spun his body around. He hit the ground and landed upside down. Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold. I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled. Chorus 2X. Always die... The Wild.. Gotham. The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}. Ha ha, riiiiide..."
the warning,"Only reason I dissed you in the first place. is because you denied seeing me. Now I'm pissed off. Sit back homey and relax,in fact,grab a six pack. kick back, while I kick facts. Yeah Dre's sick track, perfect way to get back. Wanna hear something wick wack?. I got the exact same tattoo. that's on Nick's back. I'm obsessed now. Oh gee, is that supposed to be me. in the video with the goatee. Wow Mariah, I didn't expect her to go balls out. Bitch, shut the fu*ck up before I put. all them phone calls out you made to my house. when you was wild n out. before Nick. When you was on my di*ck and give you. somethin to smile about. How many times you fly to my house?. Still trying to count. Better shut your lying mouth. if you don't want Nick finding out. You probably think since it's been so long if i had. something on you I woulda did it by now. On the contrary, Mary Poppins,. I'm mixing our studio session down. and sending it to mastering to make it loud. Enough dirt on you to murder you. This is what the fuck I do. Mariah, it ever occur to you. that I still have pictures?. However you prefer to do and goes for you too, Nick,. faggot. You think I'm scared of you?. You gonna ruin my career you better get one. Like I'ma sit and fight with you. over some slut bitch cunt. who made me put up with her psycho ass over 6 months. and only spread her legs to let me hit once. Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky?. Tell the public that I was so ugly. that you had to be drunk to f*ck me?. Second base? What the fuck you tell Nick, punk?. In the second week we was dry humping.. It's gotta count for something.. Listen, girly.. Surely you don't want me to talk about. how I nutted early cos ejaculated prematurly. and bus all over your belly,. and you almost started hurling and said. I was gross,. go get a towel you're stomachs curling.. Or maybe you do.. But if I'm embarrassing me,. I'm embarrassing you. and don't you dare say it isn't true.. As long as the song's getting airplay. I'm dissing you.. I'm a hair away from getting carried away. and getting sued.. I was gonna stop at 16.. That was 32.. This is 34 bars.. We ain't even a third of the way through.. Damn, Slim. Mariah played you.. Mariah who?. Oh did I say ''whore'', Nick? I meant a liar too.. Like I've been goin off on you. all this time for no reason.. Girl you out ya alcholic mind.. Check ya wine cellar.. Look at all the amounts of wine.. Like I sit around and think about you all the time.. I just think this is funny. when I pounce you on a rhyme.. But it now i'm about to draw the line.. And for you to cross it that's a mountain. that I doubt. you wanna climb.. I can describe areas of your house. that you wouldn't find on an episode of Cribs. A blubba load ribs. so don't go opening your jibs. cos every time you do. it's just another load of fibs. I ain't saying this shit again, ho.. You know what it is.. It's a warning shot for. before I blow up ya whole spot. Call my bluff and I'll release. every fucking thing I got. Including the voicemails. right before you flipped your top. When me and Luis were tryin' to stick. two CD's in the same spot. (Slim Shady I love you). I love you too. Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo.. Now what you say?. (It's nothing). Guess what I'll do?. I'll refresh your memory. when you said ''I want you''. Now should I keep going. or should we call truce?. (You think you're cute, right? Hahaha). You bet your sweet ass I do. (I'm Mary Poppins, b). And I'm Superman, mmm. (Mary P. Slim Shady). Comin' at you. So if you'll still be my (babygirl). Then I'll still be your (Superhero, Wilma M.). Yeah, I'm right here. (You like this). Nope. Not anymore, Dear.. It cuts like a (knife) when I tell ya get a (life). But I'm movin on with mine. Nick, is that your (wife). Well tell her to shut her mouth. then I'll leave her alone. If she don't (sing this script?). then I'ma just keep goin. (I se Mary Ann. Mary Ann's saying. ''cut the tape, cut the tape''. Knife!).

things get worse,"[Eminem - Chorus]. There?s no need to say shit you already know. The question is just how far will this go. How far will he take it?. And when will he stop?. Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up. But you just won?t listen will ya, nah I guess not. You just can?t can ya, man I can?t stand ya. You?re rotten, what you plottin? for us?. Man when are you gonna let up. I guess things are gonna get much worse ?fore they get better. Holy toledo it?s Angelina Jolie amigo. She told me yo Shady just hand your penis to me I?ll deep throat. And Brad if you try to stand between us then we?re gonna see bro. Who was a fantasy I don?t mean to damage your ego. You faggots wanna rassle I shove a f-cking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole. And rope it shut with a lasso. Couple of crushed lexapro broken up wit the capsule or paxil. Just incase I aint dope enough wit the raps though. Coke is cut with tobacco. Smoke it up then go wacko. This is what happens when you mix a cocunut with tabasco. Shady let go, the hoe has been choked up enough. Let her ass go. Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole. I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra cuter. Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her. I?m off my f-cking meds but I?m on an electric scooter. I might just scoot by and shoot my mum in the neck with rugers. Spit in Jasons face while I vomit on Freddy Krugar. They can?t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar. Now I?m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-. cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cuz. [Eminem - Chorus]. There?s no need to say shit you already know. The question is just how far will this go. How far will he take it?. And when will he stop?. [B.o.B]. B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, geez. There?s no need to say shit you already know. The question is just how far will this go. Cause I will never lay down?. And I will never let up?. (I guess things are gonna get much worse ?fore they get better). [B.o.B - Verse 2]. With the soul of a Sharman. I leave the beat than vomit. Like a bullemic woman with an uneasy stomach. I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies. Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in. So can you hear me coming. Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting. It?s probably go diseases on it. I?m just being honest, I can see the comments. I can see the evolution as we creep up on it. I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie. Shit I just do this for the haters, I dont need the money. I diarrhea on track so it needs plunging. Somebody tell these girls please release my undies. Nobody really understands my language. I find it complicated just to hold a conversation. But still I got a whole lot of patience. Sittin? back watching Earth from my Space station. [Eminem - Chorus]. There?s no need to say shit you already know. The question is just how far will this go. How far will he take it?. And when will he stop?. Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up. But you just won?t listen will ya, nah I guess not. You just can?t can ya, man I can?t stand ya. You?re rotten, what you plottin? for us?. Man when are you gonna let up. I guess things are gonna get much worse ?fore they get better. [Eminem - Verse 3]. Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bendingfield in a washer. Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle. Its like I got ya hypnotising like I gotcha. I gotcha pychologically f-cked. I would like an apology what. Tell that psycho to stick a tyco and a white tricycle up his butt. And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts. I?m as cold as a muthaf-cking icicle on my nut. I aint nuttin? nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut. The poster addict for post tramatic stress. I guess this is the most dramatic I?ve been in a while. This is the closest that its come to the Marshall Mathers. I can hear him start to gather. I don?t paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family. This aint your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny. Kick down Dakota Fannings front door while the whore is tanning. (He can?t say whore). Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties. [Eminem - Chorus]. There?s no need to say shit you already know. The question is just how far will this go. How far will he take it?. And when will he stop?. Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up. But you just won?t listen will ya, nah I guess not. You just can?t can ya, man I can?t stand ya. You?re rotten, what you plottin? for us?. Man when are you gonna let up. I guess things are gonna get much worse ?fore they get better"

thug love,"[50 Cent:]. What y'all know about this fab shit, huh?. TE baby come on, uh-huh Trackmasters uh-huh. Look we can shop together mama, his and hers. Fifth Av. shit baby, Fendi furs. I ain't tight with the chips girl. I'm down to splurge. If it's ice you like I'll light up your life (Ooh). VS2 Clarity alright. I play the block I ain't the type to punch your clock. I'm the type to put the metal to the floor in the drop. I live life in the fast lane. I make a grove of hash. Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass. It's like she loves me, she loves me not. Cause her friends pump her head hull of bullshit alot. I gave jewels I imported for her. Chanel bags I bought from boosters. To the hood I introduced her. She feisty every now and then she wanna fight me. People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon write me. The sick part is all that bullshit excites me. [chorus: Destiny's Child]. A thug's what I want. A thug's what I need. Even though my friends don't seem to see. That he lace me with money. He knows when I want it. And I'm never gonna leave my baby. My thugged out no good baby. [Eminem:]. I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners. Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters. I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.. across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}. I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth. with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse. And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate. since the third time that I failed 9th grade. You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it. I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}. I laugh at the sight of death. as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}. and land inside a bed of spider webs. So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend. can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again. Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out. Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!. [chorus: Destiny's Child]. A thug's what I want. A thug's what I need. Even though my friends don't seem to see. That he lace me with money. He knows when I want it. And I'm never gonna leave my baby. My thugged out no good baby. [Erick Seamon:]. Uh, so mean, never seen the green, knahmean?. This jump off need two trampolines. Rock hard jeans sag low, new Timberlands. I works it like Missy and Timbaland. Cuban link chain hang E emblem. Chick 'round me multiplyin like Gremlins. Word to my momma, I bring drama. Like Osama, I'ma problem, period comma. I come through with the Bizkit, Limp'n. The Underground Kingz in the building, pimpin. Oh no, they must be feelin me. Pinch me now, this don't feel real to me. Oh yeah, it's my son's communion. Next month is my fan's reunion. Write this down in your pad. I'm thirty-(""FOUR"") and a half, and yeah I'm a Sagg'. [chorus: Destiny's Child]. A thug's what I want. A thug's what I need. Even though my friends don't seem to see. That he lace me with money. He knows when I want it. And I'm never gonna leave my baby. My thugged out no good baby. [Beyonce:]. A thug is what I want. And a thug is what I need. And my friends don't understand. How my baby laces me. A thug is what I want. And a thug is what I need. And my friends don't understand. And I think its jealousy"
till hell freezes over,"Yo yo yo yo yo (this is). This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop). To hip hop music (anthem). Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music. until the day that I die (aight bitch). Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ugji boards. Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts. I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence. Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands. Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks. Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's. Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots. Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rotts. I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks. This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops. I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's. So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sending when hell freezes. [chorus]. That's why my brain is out of order. That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter. But as the world turns and I keep growing older. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over. Bitch till hell freezes over. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over. And as the world turns and i keep growing older. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over. Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap. I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap. I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song. And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long. Like this weed is laced aint, it taste tainted. Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted. Spaced out like sci-fi t.v. Fuck ICP buy my cd. cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut. telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you. Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out. Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth. [chorus]. That's why my brain is out of order. That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter. But as the world turns and i keep growing older. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over. Bitch till hell freezes over. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over. And as the world turns and i keep growing older. I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over. Uh, uh uh uh uh. Ah ah ah ah. Uh uh uh uh. Ah ah ah ah. Uh uh uh uh(Dr.dre). Ah ah ah ah(Slim shady) (Outsiders)."
till i collapse (feat. nate dogg),"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired,. Feel weak, and when you feel weak,. you feel like you wanna just give up.. But you gotta search within you,. you gotta find that inner strength. And just pull that shit out of you. and get that motivation to not give up. And not be a quitter,. no matter how bad. you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. Yo left, yo left, yo left right left. [Eminem]. Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps. long as you feel 'em. Till the day that I drop you'll never say. that I'm not killing them. 'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em. And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem.. Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women. are caught in webs spin and hauk venom. Adrenaline shots of penicillin. could not get the illing to stop.. Amoxacilin is just not real enough.. The criminal cop killing hip-hop. filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.. Your coming with me, feel it or not. you're gonna fear it like I showed you. the spirit of god lives in us.. You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock. is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.. For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot. listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.. [Chorus - Natedogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. [Eminem]. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling. you get when you're real. And you spit and people are feeling your shit.. This is your moment and every single minute. you spend trying to hold onto it. 'Cause you may never get it again.. So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can. And when your run is over. just admit when it's at its end.. 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits. with half this shit that gets in.. I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.. It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie,. Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.. But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy,. so when I'm not put on this list. the shit does not offend me.. That's why you see me walk around. like nothing's bothering me.. Even though half you people. got a fucking problem with me.. You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me. The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney.. Nate hit me.. [Chorus - Natedogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. [Eminem]. Soon as a verse starts. I eat it at Mc's heart. What is he thinking?. How not to go against me? Smart.. And it's absurd how people hang on every word.. I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve. But I'll never be served. my spot is forever reserved. If I ever leave earth. that would be the death of me first.. 'Cause in my heart of hearts. I know nothing could ever be worse.. That's why I'm clever. when I put together every verse. My thoughts are sporadic,. I act like I'm an addict. I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers.. But I don't want to go forth and back. in constant battles. The fact is I would rather sit back. and bomb some rappers.. So this is like a full blown attack. I'm launching at them. The track is on some battling raps who want some static. 'Cause I don't really think. that the fact that I'm Slim matters. A plaque of platinum status is whack. if I'm not the baddest.. [Chorus - Natedogg]. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out. Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.. Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.. Until the roof. The roof comes off. Until my legs. Give out from underneath me. I will not fall,. I will stand tall,. Feels like no one could beat me."

tonight,"Women Singing:. Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight. Verse 1:. I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs. Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs. So here's a toast to federal checks. Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh. We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks. To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks. I grapple an axe for them baffling acts. The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax. Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit. The tall shit that will end up with his skull split. Then I buried the hatchet, I carried on my back. Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it. Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two. Smoke a little bit and follow one of you. Back home when the party ends. So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints. To the finest women in the audience. Chorus:. Women Singing:. Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics). Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight. We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight.

Living as scandalous as a television evangelist. But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter. Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters. I think a living never meant for me. Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally. When I stumbled upon this resolution. By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution. You couldn't see me with binoculars. I armed like an octopus. Step on stage and you get socked and pushed. Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back. Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act. When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it. Every minute so when I win it you never resent it. I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented. You got the point when I cleverly said it. Chorus:. Women Singing:.

For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece. of plywood. I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me. With the agility to escape a killer bee colony. So get your cameras and capture how miraculous. I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was. I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this. I'm hazardous enough already as it is. Without you adding fuel to the fire. I'm cruel to the liar. Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire. Clinical studies show that I'm cynical. There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow. I'm sure the party people can agree. That I'm enchanting, with the romantic. Freaking the vocals so frantically. So throw your hands up in the atmosphere. And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like. Chorus:. Women Singing:.

tragic endings (feat. skylar grey),"I'm stumbling, I can't see straight. And it's my fault I got this way. I got my hands on something great. And found a way to mess it all up. I did my best, I tried to change. But it's just in my Dna. I got my hands on something great. And found a way to fuck it up again. Now I'm the one thing. You couldn't hate more. But you're the one thing. That I would die for. All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special. I don't need to be reminded of it every other second. 'Specially when all my self-esteem's already shot to hell. I'm falling helplessly, I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see. 'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit, every time she yells at me. Selfishly addicted, but definitely doesn't help that she. Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven, but makes life a living hell for me. She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me. I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger. A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle. Until something better comes along, and she'll just drop me like a hot potato. I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay, though. 'Cause I know she loves me, my friends, what do they know?. It's like I'm drowning at sea. Hoping that you reach for me. I know you're there but I can't see. 'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings. I'm dying to breathe. And all you do is strangle me. Such a beautiful relief. 'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings. Drunk off tragic endings. In my moments of weakness, I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally. I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously. Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me. It only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she. Gets going, she don't stop, when I'm up, she's like a downer. When I found her it was love at first encounter. Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton of eggs off the counter. Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when I'm around her. But there's just something 'bout her. That makes me not able to function without her. How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?. I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist. Make a believer out of me. And show me the way now. Or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain. 'Cause I'm going straight down the drain. I'm drowning. It's like I'm drowning at sea. Hoping that you reach for me. I know you're there but I can't see. 'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings. I'm dying to breathe. And all you do is strangle me. Such a beautiful relief. 'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings. Drunk off tragic endings. Now I'm the one thing. You couldn't hate more. But you're the one thing. That I would die for. It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out. She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else. The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself. To see me falling to pieces brings her joy, brings her hell. But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say ""screw her"". I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her. She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her. Since I'm manure, she's a sewer. This time, this piece of shit's running through her. I can see the light now, I'm running to it. What the fuck? Shoulda knew it. Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?. As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid. She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it. Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it. It's like I'm drowning at sea. Hoping that you reach for me. I know you're there but I can't see. 'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings. I'm dying to breathe. And all you do is strangle me. Such a beautiful relief. 'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings. Drunk off tragic endings"
turn me loose,"Eminem: Aite. Fred Durst: Check! Slim Shady, do the mic. kid. (Eminem). I don't do black music. I don't do Withe music. I make fight music. For High School kids. I pull side full grips. When I drive like this {screech}. With a slipped disk. From a Limp Bizkit diss. I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts. So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit. Little rich kids in cribs. Don't attempt this shit. Just step back. While I prep up to pimp this bitch. So I said to the girl, I'm like. ""What up girl?"". ""Shut up girl!"". And showed her a cut-up squirrel. She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her. Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer. I moved on to two blondes. And kissed 'em on a futon. {Ay yo baby!}. {What do you want?!}. I looked at 'em both and I was like. ""Look, check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie pus"". I need to speak to 'em immediately. They played my video on MTV last week. And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some. In comes Fred Durst. (Fred Durst). Yo Shady let me get some. Who knows what galaxy I came from. One where a bass drum hung from my high chair. Now I'm a nightmare. You stay right there. I got the diva. Hold the flavor of a single. See me and Shady?. I think we got a lock down. Shocked by the sound. I got you cruisin' with your top down. These two blondes. I offered 'em both a drink. And this you would think. Could get the party started. But instead them girls turned their heads. Opened up their mouths. Smelt like somebody farted. So if it's time for me to move on. Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor. So turn me loose. I was cuttin' the rug with this chick. Bumped into this dude who was drunk. And a prick. Ramblin' on about how. He was gonna kill me. Wow!. I spilled a drink on his shirt. But no- He insisted we should go. Before I could drop 'em. Shady had to clock 'em. The music stopped. The party stood in shock. So I looked around. Grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf. Turn me loose. Turn me loose. Turn me loose. Turn me loose. This party's goin' my way. Or no way at all. But don't you. Turn me loose. Turn me loose. Turn me loose. This party's goin' my way. Or no way at all. (Eminem). Turn me loose. You better tell 'em to come re-shingle the roof. Just keep feedin' me free drinks till I puke. And Fred'll ask me to lead sing in his group. I'm sick at the barn. I'm not bein' approached. Cuz Fred's over there stealin' all of my hoes. {Yo Fred save me some}. I walked up to these saimese twins. And asked to have a threesome. Told 'em two heads are better that one. Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one. Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin. Stood up like ""Ay wait, where you goin"" {bye!}. Oh well. Three strikes and I'm out. I struck out and stood tied to the road {ouch}. I ain't tryin' no more. Fuck it- I'm chillin'. Get a shot of yable {ahhh}. Fell asleep on the ceiling. (Fred Durst). Who knows what galaxy I came from. One where a bass drum hung from my high chair. Now I'm a nightmare. You stay right there. I got the diva. Hold the flavor of a single. See me and Shady?. I think we got a lock down. Shocked by the sound. I got you cruisin' with your top down. These two blondes. I offered 'em both a drink. And this you would think. Could get the party started.

twitsted (feat. skyler grey & yelawolf),"[Skylar Grey]. You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here. Can't you see that I've been crying?. I didn't know you'd be insane. Dreams can be so deceiving. You're an itch I can't reach. A wound that won't heal. The smell of skin that's burning. I didn't know you'd be insane. But it's true, and just say all I am to you. [Eminem]. Is a pain in my neck, thorn in my side. Stain on my blade, blood on my knife. Been dreaming of her, all of my life. But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to. [Skylar Grey]. She's twisted, he's a lover, she's set, he's hard to handle. The worst part of all is he just don't care. She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat. But the worst part of all is she really don't give a. (She don't give a shit). [Skylar Grey and Eminem]. Sometimes I wish that you'd just die. Cause I'm too afraid of leaving. I didn't know you'd be insane. Dreams can be so deceiving. (How did it come to this?. Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?). I didn't know you feel the same. When I say you're no good. All you are to me. [Eminem]. Is a pain in my neck, thorn in my side. Stain on my blade, blood on my knife. Been dreaming of her, all of my life. But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to. [Skyler Grey]. She's twisted, he's a lover, she's set, he's hard to handle. The worst part of all is he just don't care. She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat. But the worst part of all is she really don't give a. (She don't give a shit). [Yelawolf]. Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail. Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well. Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio. In the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold. Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows. Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show. But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse. And I'm sorry I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted. Sorry Juliet that you embedded the sayin'. If a dollar makes you holler then I'm gettin' the short change of it. Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel. Tangled between a dream and a coma. Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner. Then wake up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona. Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them. Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em. You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel. Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel. 'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows. Some people go crazy and they lose control. Some people jump off, some people won't let go. Some people say love, some people say why. Some people don't love, they just want a free ride. The rain won't stop, it'll never dry. If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside. [Skyler Grey]. She's twisted, he's a lover, she's set, he's hard to handle. The worst part of all is he just don't care. She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat. But the worst part of all is she really don't give a. (She don't give a shit). Maybe I'm a twisted one that screwing this up. So I guess this means Goodbye, for now"

Frightened with five little white Vicodin. pills bitin' him. I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost. Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls. I light a candle and place it up on the mantle. Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fucking handle. So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurting. (Bitch it's too late). Cause once you're hung from the drapes,. it's curtains. [Swifty]. I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator. Degrading, creating murders to kill haters. Accused for every crime known through the equator. They knew I did it for having blood on my 'gators. My weed'll hit your chest like a. double barrel gauge and. I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face. With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose. You never hear me say forgive me. I'm snatchin every penny, it gotta be that way nigga, face it. That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it. You hidin, I make the president get a facelift. Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets. Chilling in the lab wasted. I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic. Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site. And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight. [Chorus: Eminem]. So you can suck my dick if you don't like,. my shit. Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck,. my dick.

Slashing your tires, flying down Fenkell and Meyers. Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired. Jacking my dick off in a bed of barbed wire. (Hey, is Bizarre performing). Bitch didn't you read the flyer. Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor. (Aren't you a male dancer). Nah bitch, I'm retired. Fucking your bitch in the ass with a tire iron. I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip. My Dj's in a coma for letting the record skip. I'm fucking anything when I'm snorting. It's gonna cost 300 dollars. to get my pitbull an abortion. Some bitch asked for my autograph. I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed. I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam. All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom. [Proof]. Ayo, flashback, two feets, too deep up in that ass crack. Weed laced with something, nigga pass that. In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats. At a Stop the Violence rally, I blast gats. Bmi on publishing, get your Ascap-ped. The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack. Run your motherfuckin' pockets, Asap. I don't need a platinum chain bitch,. I snatch Shaq's. Born loser, half thief and half black. Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at. Bitch smacker rich rappers get they Jag jacked. And found chopped up in a trash bag. [Kuniva]. We strangling rappers until the point they can't yell. Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than. bake sales. Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace. Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums. I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle. Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you. Get executed, cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth. And it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it. I love snatching up players thugs and young ballers. Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers. Brigade barricade to bring the noise. While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys. If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo. A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva, yo, yo.... I leave ya face leaking, run up in church. And smack the preacher while he's preaching,. take a swing at the deacon. [Kon Artis]. I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight. I was straight 'til I got caught selling em shape. I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent. I got kicked out of summer camp for having sex in my tent. With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order. I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water. In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von. Who got fired from Ups for tryin to send you a bomb. (Special delivery). I signed to a local label for fun. Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run. Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son. Call your house and hang up on you for not giving me none. Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun. Got a reputation for havin niggas running they funds. Used to be the type of nigga that was folding some ones. 'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rolling in dough. [Chorus]. [Final]. Ha ha.. suck my mothafuckin' dick. D-12.. Dirty-mothafuckin'-Dozen. Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands.

Tell the critics I’m back and I’m coming. To spit back an abundance. Hit a fag with onions. Then split a bag of Funions. Mad at me understandable. Cannibal shooting animal. Out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult. Captain of a cult with an elite following. To turn Halloween back to a Trick of Treat holiday. Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar. Swipe his powers replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers. Hit Jason Vorheys with a forty. Stuck a repository up his ass. And made him tell me a story. Gave Hannibal Elector a fucking nectarine. And sat him in the fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture. Walked up elm street with a fucking whiffle bat drew. Fought Freddy Krougar and Edward Scissor hands too. And came out with a little scratch oww. Lookin like a got in a fuckin pillow fight with a triple fat goose. Insanity can It be vanity, wheres the humanity. In havin a twist of fantasy with a arm an leg amputee. straight jacket with 108 brackets. and a strap the wraps twice around my back then they latch it. cut ya fuckin head off and ask where you headed off to?. get it headed off too?. medice this headaches awful, this anistetics pathetic so is the diabetic waffel. and this prostetic arm keep crushin my hard taco.

White boy, white boy, you're untouchable. (The world's coming to an end, I don't even care). Nobody can tell me shit. 'cause I'm a. (big rockstar). Seems like the average lifespan of a white man. Is more than twice than a black life span. I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner. I feel like checking out on life. Can't escape this circumstance. I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"". than Die Antwoord. Ninja, now it's better disguised banter. But that's life. strapped 'cause we're strapped financially. And can't find answers. We're applying. but Mcdonald's. Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire. So how can we have higher standards?. As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter. We fight back with violence. but acts like that are. Black eyes on the movement. Which makes black lives madder. At cops and cops madder. That's why it's at a stalemate. Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops. I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops. The block is our backyards, officers. not the crack spot. Call the attack dogs off of us, man. You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop. And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop. Sendin' white cops. in the black neighborhoods. Who ain't acclimated to 'em. like that's the way to do it. Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns. And know nobody black so they act afraid of us. And that's racism. the fear that a black face gives 'em. A subconscious racist. Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?. 'Cause America segregated us. designated us to an area. Separated us. Section-Eight'd us. When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us. And education sucks. and every day's anotherfreddie Gray for us. a levy breaks or fuzz. Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?. We just want a safe environment for our kids. But can't escape the sirens. Don't take a scientist to see. our violent nature lies in. The poverty that we face. so the crime rate's the highest. in the lowest classes. it's like a razor wire fence. And we're trapped in these racial biases. That plague our society. which makes our anxiety levels raise. Every time we see a devil's face. Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my. It's more like billy clubs and gats. And we really love it when you think we're guilty. 'cause we're black. ""But you kill each other, facts. You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats"". Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse. While people with nothin' to lose. shoot each other for shoes. Fuck your Republican views. Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps. where the fuck are the boots?. And streets act as a narrator. don't gotta read comics. Or be that into characters. just to see that, just to be black. You better be strapped with a derringer. Or be ""capped in America"". like Steve Rogers. 'Cause no one oversees these cops and. All we see is 'em beat charges. We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious. and got off. So we don't need all. you crooked police officers' peace offerings. Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress. But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance. If you try to slander the flag but. Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb. So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum. If you don't stand for the national anthem. We raise it, you better praise it. Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor. we'll treat you like Rodney Dangerfield. Home of the brave is still racist 'ville. So this whole nation feels like a plantation field. In a country that claims. that its foundation was based on United States ideals. That had its Natives killed. Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel. To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"". that made people slaves to build"
vegas (feat. bad meets evil),"[Chainsaw revving]. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. [Eminem]. Got a shit-eatin' grin. Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again. We're in Sin City. Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope. Diggity, bitch, you need to run. And go get your frigity-friends. I'm lookin' at your bum-stickity-bum, hun. The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack. You can get the fickity-finger; the middle. You little dizzy bitch, sit and spig-a-tee-spin. Got a 6 o'clock cravin', stop, get Ciroc. It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night. I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in. Hit the spot, spot my next victim. I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'. Came to sip vodka, shit. Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies. I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear. But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha). What are you: pit, rott, mixed?. Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then let's lip-lock. If not, then chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose. You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat. Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog. Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit. Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'. My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots. Like this shit's hoppin'. And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'. So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B. I. G. , Pac. Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this. If not, then kick rocks in flip flops. And I produced the track. So you don't have to ask who it is. When this shit knocks (Turn up!). So bring clairvoyance to this bangin'. And I'm a keep on sayin'. All the shit I should be hung for. And probably killed for sayin'. And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again. Like choppin' 'til I'm droppin'. Still if that don't do the job of killin' Shady. Then the karma will. They sayin' I must bring it as Mohammad. Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain. And made me Robin Williams crazy. Or I end up with dementia, but you rockin' with a sadist. Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertainin'. I ain't stoppin' till we sprayed it. Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shakin'. But before I tie a rope around this nob. If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until. Wait, I just forgot what I was thinkin'. What's it called again? I'm blankin'. The thing above the balls between my legs. And I think I can feel it dangling. It's throbbing and it's veiny. Wait, I think I got it, okay, bitch I got you. Robin Williams hangin'. Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me. Come on kemosabe. It's past time, like your favorite hobby. Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick. Then she grab me by the nuts. And tried to take my sausage as a hostage. Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer. Or should I say Cobainer?. That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit. Gotta wean her off it, weiner off it. Like she took my fucking penis, chopped it. And stuck it up between her armpits. And she begun to swing a crumpet knife. And paint the carpet, at least. That's what her train of thought is. Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it, quit it. And made up a plate of bonkers. And I always end up giving these bitches some complex. And I don't mean apartment. So spread your feet apart. And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits. Now grab this Cuisinart. And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite. And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch. Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?). Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?. I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick. Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks. To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick. Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit. Took an unexpected twist. Like the neck of the freaking exorcist. Cha-cha-cha. Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey. Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy. I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me. You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy. I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre. Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car. And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit. And I think with my dick so come blow my mind. And it tastes like humble pie. So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride. If I let you run alongside the Humvee. Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski. So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy. You gon' blow that rape whistle on me. (Squee!) I love it. 'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off. Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway. And try not to get lost. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. Whatever happens here, stays here. So let's go all the way dear. Til we get to Las Vegas. [Royce da 5'9]. Whatever happens in my room. It stays in my room like movie night like cable. Treat every women in my stable like flavors. Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days. In 7 nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas. We roll in circles and packs, we the lifesavers. She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then. I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib waving. And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor. I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors. And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it. Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry store. With a about a million dollars with your mama. And sat down did an ALS challenge, haan. I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again. About to get my back tatted again. About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand. Sitting on a bike in the sand. If you ain't been through nothing. Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you. Like likes on the Gram. If she current I keep her pussy. Purring like the pipes on a Lamb. Weed got her so chinky eyed. Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan. I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking. Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can. Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss. If this is my passion. I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence. The gift of my absence. I don't know who you been listening to. Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop. Bitch, I don't give a two shits. Bitch, get the fuck out of my face. To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there. And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum. Even though I have an affinity for a witty banter. Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer. Hold up, she misunderstood me. I said saint, por favor. Thought I said the Wraith had four doors. I knock a nigga face off. Give him the bottom of the nine. Like a baseball scoreboard (whatever...). I leave the club with my tab still open. Won't even get a cab for you and your friend. The only fear I have is of loathing. And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas. [Eminem]. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. 'Till we get to Las Vegas. (Party, do it 'till tomorrow). Vegas. Whatever happens here, stays here. So let's go all the way dear. Til we get to Las Vegas"

Liquid Tylenol, gelatin. think my skeleton's meltin'. Wicked, I get all high when I think. I've smelled the scent of elephant manure. Hell, I meant Kahlúa, screw it, to hell with it. I went through hell with accelerants and blew up. My-my-myself again, Volkswagen, tailspin. Bucket matches my pale skin, medal win. Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin. Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics, '97 Freaknik. How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida. Proof's room slept on floor of the motel then. Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah"". And I got his stamp like a postcard. Word to Mel-Man. And I know they're gonna hate but I don't care. I barely could wait to hit them. with the snare and the bass, square in the face.

Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track. Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick. Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'. Into ya, the back of it is just mangled steel. My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill. With the front smashed. much as my rear fender, assassin. Slim be a combination of an actual. kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi).

w.t.p. (white trash party),"(Intro). Yeah... Oh.... get up, I said get up... let's go. Better watch out now cause here we come. And we ain't stoppin' until we see the morning sun. So give us room to do our thing, cause we ain't come to hurt no one. So everybody come and get upon the floor now and grab someone. (Verse 1). Man first of all, I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across. Man even my dentist hates when I floss. Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porche. Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray painted doors. With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates and my names on 'em. Baby Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him. But he ain't stupid so quit tryna run them games on him. He's immune to cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him. Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man. Now climb it back, try not to kick over the gas can. There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance. We have of just getting home, now can I get that lap dance?. She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass man. In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps. That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps. Down and show this hussie who's man, now get amped, dance!. (Hook). Now you can do this on your own, but everyone knows. That no one likes to be alone, so get on the floor and grab somebody. Ain't nothing but a white trash party!. So let's have us a little bash, and if anyone asks. It ain't no one, but us trash. You don't know, you better ask somebody. Cause we're having a white trash party!. (Verse 2). Pull up at the bacardi from outta my underwear. And walk around the party without a care, like a body without a head. Looking like a zombie from outta the Living Dead. And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed. Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer. Mixing hennessey and fanta with Pepto and Mylanta. I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' ""die santa"". Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and two innocent bystanders. So quite tryna play the wall like you Paul. And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'. They call the Stefan Marlbury of rap, darling. Cause soon as they throw on some R. Kelly I start ballin'!. Making it rain for the ladies in the mini's. But I'm not throwing ones, five's, ten's or even twenty's. I'm throwing quarters, nickels, dimes, pennys. Up at skinny's, man I do this for them bunnys up at Denny's. From the north east and west. But when it comes to them trailers in them south parks, muffle it. Cause homie, that hood's tighter than Kenny's. So ladies if your belly button's not an innie, them I'm outtie. Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy cmon!. (Hook). Now you can do this on your own, but everyone knows. That no one likes to be alone, so get on the floor and grab somebody. Ain't nothing but a white trash party!. So let's have us a little bash, and if anyone asks. It ain't no one, but us trash. You don't know, you better ask somebody. Cause we're having a white trash party!. (Bridge). Now whether you're black, white or purple if you're misunderstood. But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doing shit that you should. Long as you know you're up to evil and you're no damn good. Get on the floor mayne, and rep your hood. (Verse 3). Now honey, don't let them pricks trick. We should make a quick dip. And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot. Cause girl I got a sick whip, kick the back window outta my gremlin. Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift. And make a five seater, I'll be damned if I feed a. Chick, it ain't like me to split a peice of dry pita. I'll beat an S until the I M to the S-H-ady. Why I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater. I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down. 'for I turn over a new leaf clown, I'll tell you now. I'm so raw I still need to unthaw, you feel me ya'll. I shut the club down, like Drake in the mall!. But baby a body like that's against the law. You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw. Coleslaw containers, empty straw rappers and all. You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car, now get up!. (Hook). Now you can do this on your own, but everyone knows. That no one likes to be alone, so get on the floor and grab somebody. Ain't nothing but a white trash party!. So let's have us a little bash, and if anyone asks. It ain't no one, but us trash. You don't know, you better ask somebody.

wake up show freestyle,"[Eminem]. Yo, speed racer, 97' burgundy Blazer. Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer. I'm on some low ish,. I'm fed up wit the being broke ish. I'm not to joke wit. Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it. My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits. Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets. Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted. Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, ""Who want it?"". Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it. My 9's at your frame,is that your chain? Run it. Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor?. Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager. Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer. Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her. ( Right right right ! ! ! ) (( Ding ! ! ! )). The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics. I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you,. and I'ma make sure you come back for it. So barricade your infants, put up some extra fences. A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses ( Ooh ). ..Take em' on long vacation trips. Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships. Mess up your face and lips. Slit your stomach and watch your gut split. Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit ((Laughter)). Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone. I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on. I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber."
walk on water (feat. beyoncé),"I walk on water. But I ain't no Jesus. I walk on water. But only when it freezes (fuck). Why are expectations so high?. Is it the bar I set?. My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach. A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as. Soon as I grab, squeeze. I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze. Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening. I know the mark's high, butter. flies rip apart my stomach. Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with. You're gonna harp, gripe, and. That's a hard Vicodin to swallow. so I scrap these, As pressure increases like khakis. I feel the ice cracking, because. I walk on water. But I ain't no Jesus. (It's the curse of the- it's the curse of the-). I walk on water (shit). But only when it freezes. It's the curse of the standard. That the first of the Mathers discs set. Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet. Will this step just be another misstep. To tarnish whatever the legacy. Love or respect, I've garnered?. The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless. And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark. 'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart. Like, ""This shit is garbage! "". God's given me all this. Still I feel no different regardless. Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded. If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive. And I try not to listen to nonsense. But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence. Mission accomplished. I'm not God-sent. Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B. I. G. , James Todd Smith. And I'm not Prince, so. I walk on water. But I ain't no Jesus. I walk on water. But only when it freezes. 'Cause I'm only human, just like you. Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew. I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do. 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh. It's true, I'm a Rubik's-a beautiful mess. At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest. A flawed human, I guess. But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your. Your expectations and meet 'em, but first. The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean. He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?. There was a time I had the world by the balls. eatin' out my palm. Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on. And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on. But the only one who's looking down on. Me that matters now's Deshaun. Am I lucky to be around this long?. Begs the question though. Especially after the methadone. As yesterday fades and the Dresden home. Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn. The crowds are gone. And it's time to wash out the blonde. Sales decline, the curtain's drawn. They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind. And everyone who has doubt, remind. Now take your best rhyme, outdo it. Now do it a thousand times. Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares. or gives a fuck about your rhymes. And as I grow outta site, outta mind. I might go outta mine. 'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight. When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?. But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine. I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine. But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause. I walk on water. But I ain't no Jesus. I walk on water. But only when it freezes. 'Cause I'm only human, just like you. I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew. I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do. 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh. If I walked on water, I would drown. 'Cause I'm just a man. But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike. So me and you are not alike. Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""
wanksta (eminem's version),"Wooahhhhhhhh!. It's Shady, a.k.a. the army Shady Records. Break it down. I do a lot of spittin'. and I don't gotta try. But I ain't got rhymes to waste. So let's make 'em. I ain't say I'm a gangsta. I ain't got to start frontin'. I just get Banks up. when I need to pop somethin'. I got a friend of mine. named 50 Cent I signed. This shit's official now. the deal is finished and it's time. to get down to this business. Let's gon' get these nicks and dimes. So hurry up and cop G-Unit shit before it's gone. It's like a gold mine. for my man to take nine. And bounce right back, gotta be like Michael Myers. This shit must me a sign. These labels must be blind. Columbia I know this must be fuckin' with they mind. They know they 'bout to cry. 'cause they missed out but I. know how to get the dope 'cause Dre gave me a business mind. I say 'em a line. I hit 'em with a 9. I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber (Ha!). CHORUS. I ain't no gangsta. I ain't got to start frontin'. I just call Banks up. when I need to pop somethin'. But you gon' feel my shit. You gon' hit the stop button. We gon' fuck you up a long time. You gon' get stomped stuntin'. Chorus. Damn 50. this shit's about to hit the fan 50. The fuck happened to Ja. He got the sickest vendetta. He must think that you wetta. He bought to play with his paper. You gonna fuck with this chedda. Now homie think we gonna sweat 'em. but we just gonna forget 'em. If he don't shut up we'll get 'em. Let Yayo stomp his head and it's all good. 'cause we'd rather rap in the letter. pussy play us outta pocket homie. so tell 'em he better be easy. Start some bullshit he'll get his whole crew wet. D-twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent, and G-Unit. Yo he don't want it 'cause. he's always drugged out. You won't see no picture where his pupils ain't bugged out.

warrior part ii,"[Intro - Eminem]. Remix [echoes]. Lloyd Banks! [echoes]. Ha ha! [echoes]. [Verse 1 - Eminem]. It's like a throne that he dont even own. He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around. It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing. He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry. He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport. Runnin suckaz with the competition round the court. He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it. And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it. You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short. But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it. And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys. And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it. [Chorus - Nate Dogg]. This Is The Story Of A Warrior U Kno U Kno It. Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise. It AInt Nuthin To Be Makin Niggaz Paranoid. Hit Ur Corner Wit More Weapons I Dont Need My Boyz. Im Doin About 120 On The Fast Lane.

He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate. They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate. Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate. And he hops in a 100 thousands with a Nigga's gate. House with just a bigger gate, houndin him was a big mistake. He wont surrender he'd rather give up a rib to break. Cuz he horrendous when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand. So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan. Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name. When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game. And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them. G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them. [Chorus - Nate Dogg].

When you walked through the door. It was clear to me (clear to me). You’re the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see). You’re a … rock star (baby). Everybody wants you (everybody wants you). Player… Who can really blame you (who can really blame you). We're the ones who made you. So baby, baby. Get down, down, down. Baby, get down, down down. Baby, get down, down down. Baby, get down, get down. Baby, get down, down down. Baby, get down, down down. Baby, get down, down down. Baby, get down, get down. Oh Amy, Rehab never looked so good,.

we shine,"Artist: Da Ruckus f/ EminemReal *echoes*. Chorus: samples 4X. ""Bust it rugged, shine like a gold nugget"" (what they know about this?). ""When I bust on the mic, I bust a real hard rhyme"" ---> Keith Murray. ""Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it (what they know about. this?). ""When I bust on the mic, I bust a real hard rhyme"" ---> Keith Murray. [Verse One]. I'm rockin shit, packin shit, while stackin shit. If anyone steps up askin shit, I'm blastin shit. You gone phase me, but swingin like Peter Parker. Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the Goddamn barber. Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up. You couldn't be a dope MC if you said his rhymes drugged up. I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback. ""You couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack"". Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid. And the only mic/Mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade. Ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies. So cut the shit, cause its startin to draw flies. You're played like my five-year old's newborn toys. Don't know shit about Chicago, but I could still make Illa Noyz. Like Robin Leech I display stylish ways. Thats rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days. Listen up, all these words take heed. When I cock and squeeze, no more MC's breathe (none). I'm sick of this, here's my final dis. Fuck you dumb niggaz you ain't shit like this. Chorus: 2X. [Eminem]. My Smith and Wessy got you layin in some alley messy. Got your family lookin for your ass on Sally Jesse. We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more. Leavin your skull split like Steven Seagal. Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a mad house. So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed. We quick to pull the gat out and set it. And leave you with more shit missin than a Lil' Kim radio edit. Stick up kids be tryin to live paid. You get your grill sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your ribcage. Get the guage, cock it back, empty your pockets, Jack. Or I'ma send you flyin like a rocketpack. Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack. Break into your crib still your shit and lock it back. Ten-year old kids be standin on the block with gats. Just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats. Where I'm from...yaknow what'm sayin?, that's some old Detroit shit. y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though. Less you come. to my city, ya know what'm sayin? See where we live,. cause we shine. Chorus: 2X. [Hush]. MC's put Detroit up in they rap songs. Cause without us there careers wouldn't last long. So like a generation we've been passed on. Now its our time to shine, put your glasses on. Got these A & R's and labels with binoculars. Lookin in, jockin us and not jockin yours. Too many groups follow trends, unoriginal. Usin loops that transcend every bitch in you. Don't ever try to say this is a ghost town. One million rappers in this bitch, they need to slow down. Evualute the situation, all the rest are killers. Fly hoes out on Jefferson with the drug dealers. Two years in the joint, nobody's touchin Hush. Try to say you'll put us down, but your under us. Now who the fuck are you? its just coincidental. When your rhyme your even worse than the instrumental. Your just a phone-tapper with no backbone. Talkin shit, I got a clique that only pack chrome. Have your ass gone, nowhere to run, when we hit. Next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin wit. Chorus: 3 and 1/4."

we're still #1,"Teats and Thurston Howell, and yelling Wordsworth. My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth. I'm just a nerve purse with badly disturbed nerves. You wanna be the one to step up and get served first. 99 of aliens prefer Earth. Come here to rule the planet, storm on your turf. I hid a secret message inside of a word search. With smeared letters, runnin' together and blurs spurts. Hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts. I point water pistols at women and squirt shirts. Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers. My first words were bleep bleep and curse curse. Never had shit and I still don't deserve dirt. My breath still stinks, and I'm on my third cert. Digging out my stitches, and hollering nurse nurse!. You said this shot would numb me this shit just hurts worse!"

Wait it wasn't like a nightmare. It was like a good dreah... Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?). Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?). Yo, yo I dreamed I was white! (Ohhh). Chorus: Eminem.

The whole shibang. I know one thing. Police wouldn't always be watching me. Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me. (Can I get your autograph?). Yellow cabs in the cities that stop for me. I wouldn't need caladeral to buy property. If I was white. Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor. SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store. Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something). Because I'm black I rob. And automatically assume I ain't got no job. On my own land I feel like an immigrant. If I was white. I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent (He did it). Chorus: Eminem. If I was white. What if he was white?. What if he was white? (Yo think about that). What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute). What if he was white?.

YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!. In any case that be L-Slim right? (Yep). But there's a good and bad out of being white. You can't say the N word without starting a fight. (What's UP MY BROTHER?). True dance it'll be, I had two left feet. Even if I was white. Plaque still have a ghetto shit(How you doing?). Is it a minfo. Or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!). If I was white. I would probably listen to hardcore rock. and covered my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh). Chorus: Eminem. If he was white. What if he was white?. What if he was white? (What if he was white?). What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white. What if he was white?.

What if he was. white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if. he was white?). Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz. Yo,yo,yo, if I was white. I probably wouldn't even think the same. I watched Tennis and golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man). Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday. If I was white. I couldn't live around my way. In it probably wouldn't never even been an Onyx shit. I be serice sippin vadka and tonixs. Smokin on them all on a marboral. instead of a nueport. I live in Long Island. Instead of New York. If I was white. I probably couldn't dunk. Cuz everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!). And probably wouldn't be able to go to the trees spots. Cuz all the niggas trend think I was a cop.

what you say,"What You Say. Intro. Dre: Oh, so I'm out the game, huh. Eminem: Yo Dre, we ridin'?. Dre: Whatever.... Eminem: Well I'm wit ya homie. Dre: Okay, well let's handle the small shit. Verse 1. Eminem:. I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit. grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit, corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch. thick 'n rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth, Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth. till the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth, and if I fumble a verse, keep going, first take. I make mistakes just keep it, no punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit. fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit, wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit. Dre:. Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane, been here longer than anyone in the game. and I ain't got to lie about my age, ""But what about Jermaine?"" Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name. and don't think I don't read your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin', I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move. till I'm provoked, when I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it. you midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-yous, runnin' round your backyard swimmin' pools. over eighty million records sold, and I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds. Chorus (X2). Cus what you say is what you say, say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it. just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' wit, huh?. Verse 2. Eminem:. Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this, amatuers drink veteran piss. from a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri. we'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain. Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate. Dre:. If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry, that could save it when I'm gone and buried. to make sure the tradition carries on, I would. Eminem:. If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could. Dre:. From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'ma only sting when I cornered. Eminem:. And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning. and swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off, cus I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off. another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk, don't give a fuck, White-Pac, so much spunk. when I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill, or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer. Dre:. And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron, I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again. there's no obstacle that I can't conquer so come along wit us….Cmon. Chorus (X2). Verse 3. Dre:. Now anybody who knows Dre, knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day. but I handled my business, cus it' work before play, don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet. however you want it, you can have it your way, you fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day. bullet with your name, sendin' it your way, that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway. cus this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it, and you'll die tryin' to violate it. fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dialated. Eminem:. Like my old lady?. Cus what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings. think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone. and I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad. Dre:. And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything. catch a contract on your head, you headed west, talk shit about Dre, you better get a vest. and invest in something to protect your head and neck. Eminem:. And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best, in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest. and if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death. five mics in the Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe. to collect a fuckin' check. Chorus (X2). Outro. Dre: Watch your fuckin' mouth. Timbaland: Yo this Timbaland. Tell'em I said suck…my dick."
what's the difference,"[Dr. Dre]. Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo. I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals. Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes. the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you. But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you. I still remember the window of the car that you went through. That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through. And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you. Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you. Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you. You see the truth is. Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is. And who I'm still cool wit. Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with. Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they *voice sample*. Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions. Move units, then talk shit and we can do this. Until then - I ain't even speakin your name. Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same. Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors. It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em. That's the difference. Chorus: Phish (repeat 2X). What's the difference between me and you?. You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do. I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions. I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin. [Xzibit]. Yo I stay wit it. While you try to perpetrate, play wit it. Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (YEAH). I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted. I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick. (Yeah!) Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions. I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings. So what the fuck am I supposed to do?. I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!). A heartless bastard, high and plastered. My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never come down. Pass it around if you can't handle it. Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates. What's the difference between me and you? (What?). About five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles. Until my death, I'm Bangladesh. I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left. Yo that's the difference. Chorus. [Eminem]. Aight, hold up hold up!. STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say. Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me. (The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg. I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit. [Dre] Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it. But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch. [Em] I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?. [Dre] Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is. [Eminem]. Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer. But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma. I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her. And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California. And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner. at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her. Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off. Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of. Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up. Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up. and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water. That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product. That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!. You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!. So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis. Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!."
when i'm gone,"Yeah. It's my life. My own words I guess. Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?. Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?. When they know they are your heart. And you know you are their armour. And you will destroy anyone who will try to harm her. But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you. And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you. What happens when you become the main source of her pain. ""Daddy look what I made?"". ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane"". ""Daddy where's mommy?. I can't find mommy, where is she?"". I don't know, go play, Hailie baby your daddy's busy.. Daddy's writin' this song, this song. ain't gon' write itself. I give you one underdog,. you gotta swing by yourself. Then turn right around in that song,. and tell her you love her. And put hands on her mother. who's a spittin' image of her. That's slim shady, yeah baby slim shady's crazy. Shady made me, but tonight,. Shady's rock-a-by baby. Refrão (2x):. And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn,. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing. so baby don't feel no pain,. just smile back. I keep havin' this dream -. I'm pushin' Hailie on the swings she keeps screamin'. She don't want me to sing,. ""You're makin mommy cry, why,. why's momy crying?"". Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more,. ""Daddy you're lying,. You always say that, you always say this is the last time,. but you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're mine!"". She's piling boxes infront of the door. tryin' to block it,. ""Daddy please daddy don't leave daddy no, stop it!"". Goes in her pocket,. pulls out a tiny necklace locket,. it's got a picture,. ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with you"". I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror,. these fuckin' walls must be talkin. coz man I can hear 'em. They sayin you got. one more chance to do right, and it's tonight,. Now go out there and show 'em that you love. 'em 'fore its too late. And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door. it turns to a stage,. they're gone. And the spotlight is on and I'm singin.... Refrão. And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn,. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing. so baby don't feel no pain,. just smile back. Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seat. The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet. I take a bow, ""and thank you all for comin' out"". They're screamin so loud,. I take one last look at the crowd. I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein',. ""Daddy it's me! Help mummy. her wrists are bleedin'"". But baby we're in Sweden,. how did you get to Sweden?!. ""I followed you daddy, you told me that you wern't leavin. You lied to me dad,. and now you make mommy sad. And I bought you this coin. It says 'number 1 dad', that's all I wanted. I just wanna give you this coin. I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin"". But baby wait-. ""its too late dad, you made your choice.. Now go out there and show 'em. that you love 'em more than us. That's what they want. They want you Marshall,. they keep screamin your name,. it's no wonder you can't go to sleep. Just take another pill, yeah I bet ya you will. You rap about it. Yeah word, ke-keep it real"". I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see. How could it be that the curtain is closing on me. I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it,. put it to my brain, scream 'Die Shady!' and pop it. The sky darkens, my life flashes,. The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes. and burns to ashes. That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin',. There's birds singin', it's spring and. Hailie's out side swingin'. I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her. Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister,. almost as if to say-. Refrão. And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn,. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing. so baby don't feel no pain,. just smile back"

I have died clinically, arrived ride back at my enemies' crib with Hennessey, got drunk then I finish him.

I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered, I can't stay away from a razor, I just want my face in a paper. I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres.

when to stand up,"Artist: DJ Jazzy Jeff f/ Eminem and Parl Yams. (scratched) (3X):. ""No...you hear me! You go to hell"" -> Mr. Garrison. [Eminem]. Yo. At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth. The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt. Moms wouldn't take it, the bitch still hates me. One day she said, ""Go rake leaves,"" I said, ""Make me!"". I'm proud to announce i was probably the first kid. Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth. Arguing with me and mom was on-going. She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower. The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen. I went to start it and it screamed, ""Please fix me!"". Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince. And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then. I decided to cut class to rap full time. And get the fuck outta the fake school and rhyme. Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick. Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image. Break shit!. (scratched) (4X):. ""No...you hear me! You go to hell!"". [Parl Yams]. Yo, y'all rappers have never learned. That's why I'm fuckin wit y'all. Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit Parl. I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom. Put your brother in an air lock, choke your mom. Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven. Walk around ripping on niggas madder than James Evans. My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra. Slap my dick like Kool Keith. Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets. I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease. Parl Yams be the chosen thug. What i spit be cold juice like a fruitful hug. Run the streets while you're stuck at home. My temper life bushwick bill fucker leave me the fuck alone. I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'. These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin'. And moms just told me to act, i've been wheelin'. So boy just slow your deck, i've been stealin'. I wet rappers cause it's me and Em. I guess I just ain't give a fuck like Eminem. Burglarize take busts with the slugs. Come in your window like (? ? ?) and bustin' your club. Put the heat up I teach them niggaz what to suck. And my young lords, when to stand up and light the Dutch. (scratched) (4X):. ""No...you hear me! You go to hell!"". [Eminem]. I ended my last show with a horse swingin' a lasso. Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe. Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that. Two Zantacs I give a fuck if I sound whack. Billboard, drugs is what I kill for. I'm Happy Gilmore, you slip me anything in pill form. I'm in to mingle but I plan to stay single. Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle. Sike, I'm 24 Thursday; six more birthdays. and I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty. As long as my heart beats I'ma keep tryin to see. How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep. So ""I'm the Rapper, He's the DJ"". I'm the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin ""F/U/C/K"". So Jeff, give me a scratch (scratched: ""No!""). Y'all can kiss my ass until your lips stick to my pants. (scratched) (5X):. ""No...you hear me! You go to hell!""."

You're actions got me hot as my last rhyme. You're options will either get put out greenwich or as fine. Fine just ain't gon cut it. Drama is what you're in love with. You're one of them b-tches you run with. Lately i'm feeling smothered. (?) conceited with cover girl motives. I gotta rise above it. You think them models loving me. I'm thinking bout who doesn't, doesn't really matter what you say. Sickness in my stomach,. Told you i was gon be splitting, you don't think i mean it. Meant it, everything i got, f-ck you. Ain't no secret no apologies you keep it. Now that i'm doing my thing and you peep it. The badder times all outweigh the recent. Your energy who needs it. Every rumour you hear you go believe it. Point out the times you've seen it. You stabbed me should linked it. Revenge is mine, i need it, need a way out. It's my f-cking life, let her find a way to stay out. Bet you thought i'd break, ain't that easy. Bet you thought i need you a million times before you need me. Leave me everything that i gave to you. ain't no freebies get your coat and go.

white america,"(Prelude). America! We love you!. How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours?. The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect. The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the. United States government has sworn to uphold. (Yo I want everybody to. listen to the words of this song) or so we're told.... Verse 1. I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see, so many motherfuckin'. people who feel like me who share the same views and the same exact beliefs,. it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me So many lives I touch, so. much anger aimed in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays and. straight through your radio waves it plays and plays, till it stays stuck. in your head for days and days who woulda thought, standing in this mirror. bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide, reachin for a t-shirt to wear. that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? How could I predict. my words would have an impact like this I must've struck a chord, with. somebody up in the office, cuz Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin'. nuthin' but problems and now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government,. I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on.... Chorus X2. White America!. I could be one of your kids. White America!. Little Eric looks just like this. White America!. Erica loves my shit. I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get. Verse 2. Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself, if they were brown. Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf but Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's. dimples would help, make ladies swoon baby, ooh baby! Look at my sales. Lets do the math, If I was black I would've sold half, I aint have to. graduate from Lincoln High School to know that but I could rap, so fuck. school, I'm too cool to go back, gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin'. studio's at When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white, no. labels wanted to sign me almost gave up, I was like Fuck it, until I met. Dre, the only one who looked past, gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up. under his ass helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got. was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got Like damn,. we just swapped. Sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow, I'm like my skin is. it starting to work to my benefit now!. Chorus X2. Verse 3. See the problem is I speak to suburban kids who otherwise would of never. knew these words exist whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts. of piss, till I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence straight out the. tube, right into your living rooms I came, and kids flipped when they knew. I was produced by Dre That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked. right in, and they connected with me too because I looked like them that's. why they put my lyrics up under this microscope, searchin' with a fine. tooth comb, its like this rope waitin' to choke, tightening around my. throat, watching me while I write this, like I don't like this (nope!). All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working. round the clock, to try to stop my concerts early surely hip hop was. never a problem in Harlem only in Boston, after it bothered the fathers. of daughters starting to blossom so now I'm catchin' the flack from these. activists when they raggin', actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a. bitch, or say faggot shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the. posterchild, the mother fuckin' spokesman now for.... Chorus X2. Verse 4. So to the parents of America. I am the derringer aimed at little Erica, to attack her character. The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns. Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress. And piss on the lawns of the White House, to burn the flag and replace it. with a Parental Advisory sticker. To spit liquor in the face in this democracy of hypocrisy. Fuck you Ms. Cheney! Fuck you Tipper Gore! Fuck you with the freest of. speech this divided states of embarassment will allow me to have, Fuck you!. I'm just playin' America, you know I love you..."
who knew,"I never knew I... I never knew I... Mic check one-two. I never knew I... Who woulda knew?. I never knew I... Who'da known?. I never knew I... Fuck woulda thought?. I never knew I... Motherfucker comes out. I never knew I... and sells a couple of million records. I never knew I... And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling. I never knew I... [Eminem]. I don't do black music, I don't do white music. I make fight music, for high school kids. I put lives at risk when I drive like this {*tires screech*}. I put wives at risk with a knife like this (AHHH!!). Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now. I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out. Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out. put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?. Oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?. Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?. Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around. and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out. (Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up. You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?. {*ewwww*} Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts. Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up. Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor. Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement. (The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace. You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents. Chorus: Eminem. Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big. I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid. I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist. I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch. I never knew I, knew I would get this big. I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid. I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist. I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch. [Eminem]. So who's bringin the guns in this country? (Hmm?). I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London. And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie. where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi. I sees three little kids, up in the front row,. screamin ""Go,"" with their 17-year-old Uncle. I'm like, ""Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads. who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"". And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear. What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?. (Hmm?) So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words. when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse. (""Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!""). And fuck was the first word I ever learned. up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!). So read up, about how I used to get beat up. peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months. My life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?). Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike. So how much easier would life be. if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?. Chorus. [Eminem].

wicked ways (feat. x ambassadors),"[Hook 2x]. I'm getting by with my wicked ways. I'm loading up and I'm taking names. I want to dig my way to hell. I want to dig my way to hell. [Verse 1]. Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder. Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition. It's what you're suffering from. when you simply don't care if its an. 80 degree day and theres no fricken air conditioning. And you can't see the big terrace risen. 'Cus you got the windows up. blaring the system in your chevrolet prism. The devil ain't on the level same as him. Just someone who rebels in straight masochism. And imagine him giving him an adjective. an ass whooping so bad they should put his ass in prison. I word bully I verbally abuse verbs. like he did something to me personally. Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap. Caddilac from a K Car,. My ass from a hole in a ground, still can't tell a [?]. Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud. To shop at k-mart and it became art. And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are. To this day I still get in fights with the same broad. At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart. In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a fuck I don't play!. You think you saw this basket first?. Yeah backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay. Illest shit you could think I would say. Mind's like a pile of clay. When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?. Put a gaping hole in it. [?]. Tied him around my neck. went down the fire escape of the Empire State. Straight fell straight down to the ground. splattered all over the entire state. And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates. So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray. But I sacheted around flames with a match. and I gave him the gas face [?]. And this got nothing to do with a scalar. [?]. By the way thoughts are getting darker by the day. I'm a combination of Skylar Grey,. Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay. It's a fucking miracle to be this lyrical. Paint my face with clown make up. and a smiley face I'm insane. Every rhyme I say [?] like an ultra violet ray. I?m sellin hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat. $11.99 so come on and pile a plate. I?m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise. With the rhyme I?m spittin while I?m shittin' on the competition. In the meantime it?s always mean time. [Hook 2x]. [Verse 2]. I?ve been a career asshole. I don?t see why these people always got my back. I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake. But I was put here not by accident. I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish. Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel. in this shit. And I?m coming to get that quarter back. [?] the drama can build. Your mama can ask me for my autograph. That cougars a Milf, she's the oldest trick in the book. But I sure would fall for that. You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight. When I get on the mic I'm a snap. Make you wish the ambulance. that took me to the hospital when I overdosed. would have caught a flat. If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it. Indigestion my suggestions [?]. If it feels like I'm running away with the game. Its 'cus I am don't speculate spectate. All I got is ?? days and insults for decades. But I get by my wicked ways lady. you can suck a dick till your neck aches. Cry till you get puffed eyes red face. But I'm leaving on this jet plane. ????. I'm sick of pounding a squarepagan. around all ?? of the catchrays. But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage. over headspace. Cuz you just ain't big enough to fit your damage ???. Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase. Cuz baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds. I peed my bed. I'm going blind I don't see my legs I keep on falling down. No wonder you can't stand me I need my cane. Someone help me I think my face is melting. You ???my grains these maggot in my brain. This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head. If you read my mind you can see my pain. And you'd see why I'd be this way. Ever since I was ???playin' with ??. Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game"

A little bit of weed. mixed with some hard liquor. Some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker. Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital. By the Dr. when I'm not co-operating. When I'm rocking the table. while he's operating (Hey!). You waited this long now stop debating. Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating. I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney. But your husbands heart problem is complicating. So the FCC won't let me be. Or let me be me so let me see. They've tried to shut me down on MTV. But it feels so empty without me. So, come on dip, bum on your lips. fuck that,. Cum on your lips & some on your tits. And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy. I just settled all my lawsuits,. ""Fuck you Debbie!"".

Well I'm back (da-da-na-na-da-nanana). fix your bent antenna. Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter. In up under your skin like a splinter. The center of attention back for the winter.

You 36 year old bald headed fag blow me. You don't know me, you're too old. Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno. Now let go, just give me the signal. I will be there with a whole list full of new insults. I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil. Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol. But sometimes the shit just seems,. Everybody only wants to discuss me. So this must mean I'm disgusting,. But its just me I'm just obscene. Though I'm not the first king of controversy. I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,. To do Black Music so selfishly. And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey). Here's a concept that works. 20 million other white rappers emerge. But no matter how many fish in the sea. It'll be so empty without me.. Now this looks like a job for me. So everybody just follow me. Cuz we need a little controversy,. Cuz it feels so empty without me..

But I won't back down, oh no I won't back down, oh no. (Verse 1). Cadillacs Sevilles, Coupe Deville's. Brain dead rims, yeah stupid wheels. Girl I'm too for real, lose your tooth and nails. Try to fight it, try to deny it, stupid you will feel. What I do, I do it well. Shooting from the hip, yeah boy I shoot to kill. Half a breath left on my death bed. Screaming F that, yeah super ill. Baby what the deal, we can chill. Split a half a pill and a happy meal. Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off. And step on the receipt before I foot the bill. Listen garden tool, don't make me introduce you to my power tool. You know the fucking drill. How you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?. Summer's eve massingale. Shady's got the mass appeal, baby crank the shit. Cause it's your god damned jam. You said that you want your punclines a little more compact. Well shorty I'm that man. These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man. I gave Bruce Wayne a valium. And said settle your fucking ass down, I'm ready for combat man. Get it, calm Batman? Nah, ain't nobody who's as bomb and as. Nuts, lines are like mom's cat scans. Cause they fucking go ba-na-nas. Honey I applaude that ass, swear to god man.

Girl forget remorse, Imma hit you broads with. Chris' force like you pissed him off. Talented with the tongue motherucker, you ain't got a lick in yours. Hittin' licks, like I'm robbin' liquor stores. Making cash registers shit their drawers. Think you spit the rawest?. I'm an uncooked slab of beef laying on your kitchen floor. Otherwords, I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back. Bring it to extension cords. Imma measure my dick, shit I need six inches more. Fuck my dick's big bitch, need I remind you. That I don't need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig. You're addicted, I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here. Need a fix oc? I'm the big shot, get it dick snots?. You're just small boats, little pricks. Girl you think that other prick's hot?. I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match. Before I sit back and let him get hot. Better call the cops on him quick fast. Shady'd right back on your bitch ass. White trash with a half a six pack in his hatchback. Trailer hitch at-tached to the back, dispatch. (Hook). You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards. You can fence in your yard, you can pull all the cards. But I won't back down, oh no I won't back down, oh no. (Verse 3). Bitch am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'. Does a bird chirp, Lil' Wayne slurps syrup til he burps. And smokes purp, does a wordsearch get circles wrapped around it. like you do when I come through, I'd like you to remind yourself. Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic. Oh you're the kinda girl I can take a liking to. Psych I'm spiking you, like a football. Been this way since I stood a foot tall. You're a good catch, with a shitty spouse. Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw. Gimmie good brain, watch the woodgrain. Don't want no cum-stain, bitch you listening?. Try to turn me down, slut I'm talking to you. Turn me back up, are you insane. Try to talk over me in the car, shut the fuck up while my shit's playing. I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life. What's the saying? when there's thunder then there's light-ening. And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place. Then how the fuck have I been hit six times. On three different locations on four seperate occasions?. And you can bet your stinking ass. That I've come to smash everything in my path. Folk was in the road, took the psychopath. Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash. So hit the dancefloor cutie, while I do my duty. On this microphone, shake your booty shorty. I'm the shit, why you think Proof used to call me doodie?. (Hook). You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards. You can fence in your yard, you can pull all the cards. But I won't back down, oh no I won't back down, oh no"

I guess it's time to pick a different weapon, man this shit's depressin. But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present.

You packin somethin special in your crib then bitch get it. I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile (uh-huh). with this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils. You get splitted and guess what, I'm blowin up the hospital. and wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe. I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector. Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em. [Chorus]. [Bizarre]. I'm eatin crews like I'm Hannibal. There's no way I can be the gay rapper. (Eminem: Why not?) I only fuck animals (Oh! Ha-ha). Stupid trick got my dick startin to itch. Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch. One on one in this bloodsport. I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports. (Your honor!) Six times I been arrested; how would you feel. if you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?. (It happens) I'm smokin dank drinkin drank. I can't have any kids cause I'm fuckin shootin blanks!. Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?!. Nicole's a whore - I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut (uhh!). Responsibility - I'm negligent.

worst come to worst,"peace to Thirston Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth. My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth. I'm just a nerd cursed with badly disturbed nerves. Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first. Ninety nine percent of aliens prefer Earth. Come here to rule the planet, storm on your turf. I hid a secret message inside of a word search. With smeared letters, runnin together and blurred spurts. Hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts. Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts. Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers. My first words were bleep bleep and curse curse. Never had shit and I still don't deserve dirt. My breath still stinks, and I'm on my third cert. Digging out my stitches, and hollering nurse nurse. You said this shot would numb me this shit just hurts worse. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww). Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to. The only key that I see to defeat you. would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you. and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe. I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse. you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you. (Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal. I ain't tryin to shoot you,. I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you. Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass. and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress. Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!). Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis. I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket. to fill it full of explosive gasses. and close it back with a lit match in it. while I sit back and just hope it catches. Blow you to fragments. Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. Yo, speed racer, 97' burgundy Blazer. Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer. I'm on some low ish,. I'm fed up wit the being broke ish. I'm not to joke wit. Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it. My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits. Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets. Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted. Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, ""Who want it?"". Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it. My 9's at your frame,is that your chain? Run it. Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor?. Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager. Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer. Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her. The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics. I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you,. and I'ma make sure you come back for it. So barricade your infants, put up some extra fences. A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses. ..Take em' on long vacation trips. Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships. Mess up your face and lips. Slit your stomach and watch your gut split. Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit. Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone. I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on. I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber. I'm sick of the crap, what's Dr. Kevorkian's phone number. I come in here spitting. With nine riffing non-fiction. Rappers try to step to this. With no prediction. And now I'm bashing and crashing. And thrashing. I hate rappers with a passion. When I'm chilling next to DJ Fashion. Aiiiyyo. I need a f***ing Kleenex. Before I die like withered pheonixes. When I'm chilling with Felix. Hit em with the freestyle.... (scratches). I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends. Holdin a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends. Sprayin tecs at you until you see your fuckin legs. with the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin next to you. Fuckin mad dog, foamin at the mouth. Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin at the couch. Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building. and shot every window out on the way down to the ground (keep filming). Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half. Suffocated the oxygen mask. Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again. Slide back to where u come from and stand in the crossfire. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. When tha worst comes to worst. My peoples come first. How would you like to suck my balls"""

Cause they know they hands tied, feet ball and chained up. N-ggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent. Because of my relationship with Marshall. Used to make me a little partial, but here?s the brain f-ck. We the same cuz. I?m probably about to fall out with a young buck. While I attempt to f-ck the f-cking game up. Bitch, splat, only thing I fear in here is chit-chat. You are hearing bars like your ear against a Kit Kat. Shady guys like the Navy, drive, wavy bye-bye. Maybe my Glock can turn your top to baby?s Maybach. My shit is powerful, literally sick, trust me n-gga. It?s ugly to kill a thing if the bigger I get. The more disgusting and f-ckin? disfigured it gets. N-ggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop. Y?all about the champagne, I?m about the toast. I, only f-ck with mailmen with heroin from Boca.

I?m gettin? writer?s block. Psyche!. [Verse 2 - Royce da 5'9'']. When I stand up in this booth, n-ggas notice it. Sittin? on the same boat that Noah built. Floatin? on the same water Moses split. Poetry in motion, but we sittin? on your grave site, overkill. Aren?t you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet!. Real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin? a new hybrid. You dudes is too excited. You a dude that?d try to sue a dude that?s suicidal. You will just be another victim. I am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie, I?m a little twisted. I roll like the end credits in movies, y?all just got scripted. Got y?all n-ggas? bitches bobbin? to this one when she witcha. When she wit? me, she bobbin?, not vibin?. Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper. I?m a sperate with a purpose, havin? problems?. Not a problem I?ve encountered. I have found elephants, lions, clowns. Will jump through hoops like they workin? for the circus. At the fire round the circle?s right in front of them, fire rounds. Pun intended, gun extended, what are you mark?s askin??. Car?s Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it. Since I decided to start Class diss. All black, all glass, panoramic roof been gettin? marked absent. I authorize my own all-access. Your bitch a whore, I?m a catch, she ball-catchin?. Her jaw?s been broadcasted all across the globe from the store to Japan. Her p-ssy need to blocked and reported as spam. Bong! Interscope up in this dope and I sell it. My voicemail is full, got bitches screamin? inside of envelopes. And they tryna mail ?em to me, tryna reach my phone. I don?t know which one is harder. Tryna not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own. [Hook]. I got Gucci?s on my feet. Diamonds on my neck. Diamonds on my wrist. Bitches on my dick. But y?all already said that.

y'all ready know (feat. slaughterhouse),"Yo, yo, yo. This your man Royce Da 5'9"". This your dude Crooked I. Man, Jump off Joe Beezy. Yaowa - It's Joell Ortiz. [Joell Ortiz]. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse. [Joell Ortiz]. Little niggas get your weight up fuck y'all, pay up. My bars just as slick as my dick and both stay up. Nicer than me, say what? Wait up, straight up. I finish niggas right off the bat like a layup. I seen a lot of come, I seen a lot of go. But y'all know where I'm from, B-R double O. You know the rest pimpin', yeah, I was bred different. Here come pops with the NY bop, you know, the leg limpin'. My ice mug frozen till it's stiff. Grimy nigga, might wanna hold onto your bitch. I got a way with women, I faithfully play with women. Let 'em suck on this bottle and pray that I throw a baby in 'em. I might just throw on my gold fronts. Pour up a cup of E & J and light up a dro blunt. I was never soft, never saw me flinchin' when they lettin' off. Never had to retaliate cause I set it off. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse. [Royce Da 5'9]. Ya'll know my name, bitch, never change up my language. I'm just a rich nigga from a city that's bankrupt. First we take oath, then I'm pulling turquoise strings. In my Lebron corks, in Turks and Caicos. I came from wicker chair fame wearin' short sets. I learned that money can't buy happiness. But I decided I'd rather do all my cryin' in the Corvette. Make a dollar, buy a suit. Have a child, and have 'em follow suit. Wavin' that weather change thing. Make the winter fall, coming through with everything to lose. Taking everything from you know. Let him finish his fall in his draws. And pray that he land on that minute hand in my Hublot. I'm about that Art Of War gospel. That Basquiat Picasso drawing a roscoe. Using the blood of a usual thug who was told die slow. Your money on me, bet it all, you know I'mma set it off. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse. [Joe Budden]. Let's skip the small talk and get right to the wealth. Truth is I give a fuck, but it's right to myself. Fuck fame, keep the shit I write to myself. If what I do is therapeutic, man, the slightest shit helps. Made angel dust my freshman year. Gave it a try, cool, little did I knew. Had the wrong meaning of high school. Teachers called him a sociopath and a liar. Fuck them, only went to class for the cyphers. Now I'm gettin' bills for. The same thinking they tried to prescribe pills for. They said I needed a wrench, I'm a loose screw. Vital, suicidal, said I would kill me or more. Wasn't speakin' in French, said I'd let it off. Never know who or what you might get. Main reason they never want me to set it off. You now dealing with four niggas that's never off. All bets are off, so nah, you won't be better off. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse. [Crooked I]. Jewish tats on my arm like a Semitic boss. Egyptian ankh hanging, that's my Kemetic cross. Slaughterhouse set it off. Even got bitches wavin' our flag, Betsy Ross. Old school Chevy, the head is off. Decapitated Impala. Heavy 'lac from the weight of the llama. Still bear arms like a shaven koala. How you thinkin' like a faded neurology student. Is prudent when chasin' a dollar. So never mind, a clever rhyme. I'd rather find a better grind, forever times. Sittin' behind me because I'm ahead of mine. In this era I'm livin' outside of the paradigm. I'm comin' outside with a pair of dimes. Sharon and Caroline. Share a line then they share a 9 inch, never mind. I probably shouldn't even keep going. Cause these rappers keep hoein' with their teeth showing. I set it off. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse"
yellow brick road,"What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you wish to be saved, not in a religious sense. but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should move up from our parents station. and each generation should do a little bit better. Aight come on, let's cut the bullshit enough. Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up. Let's take this shit back to ""Bassmint"". And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape. And it's whole origin of the music that we all know and love. The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy. Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit. Crossin' 8 Mile in the border in the hate territory. I'd like to share a story. this is my story and can't no body tell it for me. You will well inform me. I am well aware that I don't belong here. You've made that perfectly clear. I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere. From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there. From the black side all the way to the white side. Okay there's a bright side, a day that I might slide. You may call it a past, I call it haulin' my ass. Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks. Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks. Them good old notorious oh well known tracks. CHORUS. So let's go back. Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode. Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place. that I once used to call home sweet home. Come on let's go back. Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode. Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place. that I once used to call home sweet home. I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter. Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike. Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and van dike. And steal a Goddamn bike from somebody's backyard. And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark. To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's them dramas after dark. To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's. That's about the time I first met Proof, when poof he'd carry on the set. Set eyes born in and out some flyers, he was doin' some talent shows. At centerline, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime. He looked at me like I'm out my mind. Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme. I spit out a line, rhymed ""birthday"" with ""first place"". And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike. We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit. wit' compound syllables sound combined. From that day we was down to ride. somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line. Chorus. My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school. It was cool till your man MC Sham came through. And said that Boom was the brain 'cause the clan makes troops. It was rumors but man god damned they flew. Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes. I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too. And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news. Guess who came through next, X clam debut. Professor X (and glorious). exists in a state of red, black, and green with a key, sissies. Now with this bein' a new trend, we don't fit in. Crackers is out with Cactus albums, blackness is in. African symbols and medallions. represent black power, and we ain't know what it meant. Me and my man Howard and ??? would go to the mall. wit' 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off. Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at. You ain't even half black. You ain't 'posed to have that. Homie let me grab that. And that Flavor Flave clock. We gon' have to snatch that. All I remember is meetin' back at, Manix's basement. Sayin' how we hate this, our races wit' dope the x clan take this. Which reminds me, back in '89 me, and Kim broke up for the first time. She was tryna two time me. And there was this black girl at our school. who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me. And oh the irony, guess what her name was?. I ain't even gon' say it plus. The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs. The bombast God damn girl in our whole school. If I could pull it not only would I become more popular. but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time. But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her. but she dumped me for this black guy. And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl. But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad. But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize. I was wrong, 'cause no matter what color a girl is she still a ???. Chorus"

The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it. It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is su nemesis. Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images. But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out. When there's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out. If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it. It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it. We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit. And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it. And let it go to whoever's holdin' the most current people on their shoulders. And their soldiers got their backs till it's over. But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody. We came to party, Banks, Ca$his and Mr. Ferrari. So it's Shady Aftermizat back in that ass, you wizzass. Come hizzon what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that. [50 Cent & Eminem]. Who run it?. You know, you actin' like you don't know. I tear the club up fo' sho. This flow is gon' bring more dough. And you know but you actin' like you don't know. Who run it?. I say you know, you actin' like you don't know. I tear the club up fo' sho. This flow is gon' bring more dough. And you know but you actin' like you don't know. [Ca$his]. Pistol play ricochet, see where the victim lay. Slumped over bleeding J.F.K. Hays K to your chest plate cave. I ride to the death, do you rep that way?. Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta. Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber. I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef. You keep talking shit now the squad called me. [Lloyd Banks]. Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine. Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams. Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see. Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G. I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static. And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet. Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit. And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?. [50 Cent]. So who run it?. You know, you actin' like you don't know.

you still love me,"[ Intro - Eminem ]. You still love me?. Take this. You ready?. 1 - 2 - THREE!. *BANG, BANG*. [ Ritornello 1 - Eminem ]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's making me happy. The more that you slap me,. the more that it turns me on. Because you love me and I love you more. . [ Verso 1 - Eminem ]. It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit. We say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us. It's lust, 'cuz neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck. 'till we bust, 'till cuss each other out, we know what it's about. Shout 'till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house. I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth, we fist fight. 'till we turn this mother out and apologize after, laughter. Pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again. And it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you. There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do 'cuz. . [ Ritornello 1 - Eminem ]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you.

Good, 'cuz you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry. It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you. on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you. You FUCK other people and I FUCK other people. You're a SLUT, but i'm equal, i'm a MUTT, we're both evil. in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it. 'Cuz one of us would have one up on the other so forget it. We can make accusations, people spread rumours. But they ain't got proof, 'till they do, it's just the two of us. You and me, 'cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me. But you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed. If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would. 'Cuz the sex is too damn good, if I ran, who would I run to?. It would be this soft and ???, so it's off and on. Usually more off then on but at least we know that we. Share this common bond, you're the only one I can fuck. without a condom on, I hope the only reason that I cope. Is 'cuz if that faggot busts then. I can bust in that, and that's why. .

[ Verso 3 - Eminem ]. I can never understand it,. that's why I don't try. From junior high until we both die,. you silly hoe why must we try. Is it really so rough that we must always. call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff. Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs. We're lying to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah. 'Cuz we truly love each other, that's why we always fight. And all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night. And it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this pinned up rage. We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged. By someone else, we both been. someone else's someone else. The problem is neither one. wants help, it's an addiction. And it can't be fixed, our family's mixed up. There's a baby sister in the mix and it hurts. 'cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit. And anybody who thinks. he knows us doesn't know shit. And they're probably just tired. of hearing it all the time on every song. Every lyric and every rhyme,. all the hoopla, all of the woopty woo. What you put me through, fuckin' woopty do. But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love. You wouldn't do what you did last time,. you wouldn't screw up. This time, 'cuz this time girl i'm tellin you what. You do it again and i'm fuckin' you up 'cuz no matter. . [ Ritornello 2 - Eminem ]. What you say, what you do. I'ma hunt you down 'till I find you. No matter where you run, i'll be right there. Right behind you in your nightmares. So much for them flowers, and the candy. All the times that you threw it back at me. Told me you hate me, you 'gon hate me more. When you find out you can't escape me, whore. . [ Ritornello 1 - Eminem ]. The more you put me through. The more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more.

Yeah it's the best thing I could do. right now for you Doodi is to rap. So I'mma fuck til' I die, yeah I'mma do it to death. And instead of mourning your death. I'd rather celebrate your life. Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate. I'mma need two mics. 'Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight. everything I can just do right. There's nothing that I can do wrong. I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped. Just finished the rhyme and bust it. and excuse the corny metaphor. They'll never 'ketchup' to all this energy that I've 'mustard'. So God just help me out. while I fight through this grieivin' process. Try'na process this loss is makin' me nauseous. But this depression ain't takin me hostage. I've been patiently watchin' this game. pacin' these hallways. You had faith in me always. Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump. rise from these ashes. Come right back on they asses. and go Mike Tyson on these bastards. And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water. slaughter 'em homes. I'll own so many belts. the only place they can hit me is below 'em. Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same without you. I woulda never came in this game. I'm going insane without you. Matter of fact it was just the other night. had another dream about you. You told me to get up. I got up and spread my wings and I flew. You gave me a reason to fight. I was on my way to see you. You told me nah Dudey. you're not layin' on that table I knew. I was gonna make it. soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew. There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies.

Just grant me the strength that I need. for one more day to get through. So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you. I love you Dudey. (Hook). The days are cold, livin' without you.

zelda rap (remix),"[Announcer]. Welcome back, to the stage of history. [Eminem]. Yo.. Slim Shady!. Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll... I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww). Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to. The only key that I see to defeat you. would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you. and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe. I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse. you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you. (Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal. I ain't tryin to shoot you,. I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you. Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass. and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress. Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!). Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis. I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket. to fill it full of explosive gasses. and close it back with a lit match in it. while I sit back and just hope it catches. Blow you to fragments. Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes. Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X). I see the light at the end. But every time I take a step, it gets dim. Tell me is this hell we're livin in?. If so, heaven's got to be better. But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down. [J-Black]. Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never). I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse. I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc. Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot. One day we all gon' die. But when I die, I'ma be so high. that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare. with the chalk outline still there. I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot. I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock. Now if I pray everynight (night). Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?. You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth. I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse. I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse. Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk. See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface. Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith. Angels greet me but I don't reply back. Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?. Chorus 1/2. [Announcer]. Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns. Final battle, fight!. [Masta Ace]. Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso. Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso. And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger. Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger. I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound. And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds. My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger. Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her. Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her. Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager. My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel. My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel. Everyday I grow more older, and more colder. Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder. I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare. Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care. Chorus. [J-Black]. But every time I take a step, it gets dim... Tell me is this hell we're livin in?. Haha... [Announcer]. Time's up!. You lose!"
