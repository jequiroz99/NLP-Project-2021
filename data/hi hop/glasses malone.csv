rich n thuggin (ft. ya boy),"You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket. But I'm a keep it hood, I ain't got no other option. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket. I'm a keep it hood, I ain't got no other option. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. Rich and bitch, LV's on my kicks. And you know I switch whips like my draws and my fits. Cleaner than a pimp with a purple kush stitch. ... you know I'm trying to ball like I'm fresh off the bench. Bentley on my wrist, phantom on my neck. See I'm fresh about the bricks but still got them on deck. Life is a movie and you acting on my set. When I yell cut you'll never work in this town again. I'll be moving so mean hood nigger with a dream. Gotta stay strapped so I don't get Martin Luther King. Product of the crime rate, broke niggers why I hate. Take me out the hood but can't change a nigger mind of state. You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket. But I'm a keep it hood, I ain't got no other option. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket. I'm a keep it hood, I ain't got no other option. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. ... to boutiques I can't pronounce. Talking not real amounts the cash is... to count. Now that's cash, fuck bank accounts. The shoe box old just in case I gotta bounce. On the law, cause we ball, night in and night out. The shooters all around, they pull up is like.... Rounds pierce, and I ain't talking about.... These shots will leave a... nigger... than.... Now back to the Kobe on the rumble bee. Catching rolling through the street is like a tumble.... So my advice to you haters is to come and squeeze. Cause death the only thing that's gonna humble me. You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket. But I'm a keep it hood, I ain't got no other option. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket. I'm a keep it hood, I ain't got no other option. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. Yeah, yeah,. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket. But I'm a keep it hood, I ain't got no other option. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging. You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket. I'm a keep it hood, I ain't got no other option. Baby I'm rich, and I'm thugging. I'm rich, and I'm thugging."
