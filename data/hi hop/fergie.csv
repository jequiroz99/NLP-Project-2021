life goes on,"Every day when I wake up. Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup. But it seems like I never finish. It's always half full (or is it half empty?). Maybe it's my own superstition. Or a kind of self protection. If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead?. Still sittin' here. Just watching the sun go down (down) , down, (down) , down. Life goes on with or without you. It's up to you what you're gonna do. You could go or you could stay. Who cares anyway?. Life goes on with or without you. Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?. You could go or you could stay. But who cares anyway?. (Who really cares?). Every conversation gets me high on motivation. Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (yeah). Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable. In the midst of all the madness (remember life's beautiful). Still I'm feeling restless. Thinking I should rest less. Work more, play hard, ready for the encore. Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times). In my heart I know, less is more (more). More (more) , more, more, more. Life goes on with or without you. It's up to you what you're gonna do. You could go or you could stay. Who cares anyway?. Life goes on with or without you. Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?. You could go or you could stay. But who cares anyway?. It's time to take this out of my hands. Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?. 'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone. Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah). But then again this way I'll never know, never know. Maybe I should go. Go crazy, go insane, go for everything. Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching. Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?. The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli. And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly. They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?. Really, really? Really really though?. Really, really, really though?. Feel the vibration of the higher ground. Love always leads to the highest sound. Many conversations, people makin' speculations. As to my procrastination due to my revelations. And then they get fugazi. You call yourself a rider. You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti. Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality. We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari. Life goes on with or without you. It's up to you what you're gonna do. You could go or you could stay. Who cares anyway?. Life goes on with or without you. Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?. You could go or you could stay. But who cares anyway?. Who cares anyway?. You could go or you could stay. You could go, you could stay"

love is pain,"You don't know how it feels to be me. Wish you could feel it. You could never survive this burning. Fever growing inside the shell. That you call a body. What have you done to us. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. You know when I'm lost and insecure. You bring me down further. I could never live up to perfect. Just when I've had enough. Your views change. Love fills me up. It's fire we're playing with. And I'm like a moth attracted to the flame. One day when you wake up missing me. I hope you go insane. Woah. Cause pain is love and love is pain. Cause pain is love and love is pain. Cause pain is love and love is pain. And when they all act like crazy. You will appreciate me. Cause no one else will love you more. And take the pain from your thoughts. And when your world is falling. Baby I'll let you crawl in. When you can love me all the way. Cause pain is love and love is pain. Cause pain is love and love is pain. Stone wick face on the outside. Goddess soul on the inside. I have cried you a thousand oceans. Cold in every dimension. This Vitruvian woman. I can't stretch enough to be. Everything to everyone, that's real. And one day when you wake up missing me. I hope you go insane, oh. 'Cause pain is love and love is pain. 'Cause pain is love and love is pain. . And when it hurts like crazy, you will. appreciate me. 'Cause no one else will love you more. And take the pain from your thoughts.

all that i got (the make up song) (feat. will.i.am),"Baby, baby when you're looking deep into my eyes. I know you're seeing past my make-up. Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry. when her parents fought, tryin' to be strong. You can see the hurt in me. The cover ups so secretly. and all that I aspire to be, you see,you see. You know who I really am. No entourage or caravan. And do you even give a damn, about all that and tell me. Would you love me if I didn't work out. or I didn't change my natural hair?. I could be the one you want grow older with, baby. I'll give you all that I got. So I dont mean to scare you now and push you away. Cuz I'm not tryin' to rush anything. But when I look into your eyes I'm not scared to say. I sit near you, I'm in the picture too. Like a happy family tree, we're together costantly. This could be eventually, we'll see, we'll see. But all that I have got to know is with me baby you will grow. Through sun and rain and heavy snow. Oh tell me so now, baby. Would you love me if I didn't work out. or I didn't change my natural hair?. And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby. I'll give you all that I got. (Will.I.Am rap verse). It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you. And three and four, you're all I adore. To the seven and height, see I've been making mistakes. Cuz when you're on my mind, I just can't think straight. Back to the five and six. I'm all in the mix and I'm all into you. Without the lipstick, without the L'Oreal. You remain the same angel that I fell for, for real, for real. Would you love me if I didn't work out. or I didn't change my natural hair?. And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby. I'll give you all that I got. I'll give you all that I got. Don't let aaah, yeah"
finally (feat. john legend),"Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream. Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems. Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day. But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes. I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold. This classic story told, I left it in the cold. Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you. Each one unlocking more of the truth. I finally stopped tripping on my youth. I finally got lost inside of you. I finally know I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. I remember the beginning you already knew. I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool. Fronting like it didn't matter. I just ran away, on another face. Was lost in my own space. Found what it's like to hurt selfishly. Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe. I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place. Stumbled through the mess that I have made. Finally got out of my own way. I've finally started living for today. I finally know I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. Finally, finally. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something beautiful is happening, happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. Ohhhhhhh, finally, finally, finally"

finally (feat. john legend),"Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream. Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems. Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day. But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes. I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold. This classic story told, I left it in the cold. Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you. Each one unlocking more of the truth. I finally stopped tripping on my youth. I finally got lost inside of you. I finally know I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. I remember the beginning you already knew. I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool. Fronting like it didn't matter. I just ran away, on another face. Was lost in my own space. Found what it's like to hurt selfishly. Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe. I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place. Stumbled through the mess that I have made. Finally got out of my own way. I've finally started living for today. I finally know I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. Finally, finally. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something beautiful is happening, happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. Ohhhhhhh, finally, finally, finally"

labels or love,"Shopping for labels, shopping for love. Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of. Shopping for labels, shopping for love. Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of. I already know what my addiction is. I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love. I shop for purses while I walk out the door. Don't cry, buy a bag and then get over it. And, I'm not concerned with all the politics (?). It's a lot of men I know I could find another one.. Oughta know that I'm always happy. When I walk out the store, store. I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy,. Nothing to be playing with. I love him, hate him, kiss him,. Just I'm trying to walk a mile in my kicks. (Chorus). Love's like a runway but which one do I love more. No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior. Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for. Let's stop chasing them boys and shop some more. I know I might come off as negative. I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love. Relationships are often so hard to tame. A Prada dress has never broken my heart before. And, ballin?s something that I?m fed up. I'mma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing. Cause I know that my credit card will help me put out the flames. I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy,. Nothing to be playing with. I love him, hate him, kiss him,. Just I'm trying to walk a mile in my kicks. [Chorus]. Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer. things. Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them. diamond rings. I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach. Fellas boast but they can't really handle my female approach. Buying things is hard to say. Rocking Christian Audigier, Manolo, Polo, taking. photos in my Cartier. So we can't go all the way, I know you might hate it but. I'm a shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love"

Just when I've had enough. Your views change. Love fills me up. It's fire we're playing with. And I'm like a moth attracted to the flame. One day when you wake up missing me. I hope you go insane. Woah. Cause pain is love and love is pain. Cause pain is love and love is pain. Cause pain is love and love is pain. And when they all act like crazy. You will appreciate me.

Life goes on with or without you. It's up to you what you're gonna do. You could go or you could stay. Who cares anyway?. Life goes on with or without you. Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?. You could go or you could stay. But who cares anyway?. (Who really cares?). Every conversation gets me high on motivation. Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (yeah). Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable. In the midst of all the madness (remember life's beautiful). Still I'm feeling restless. Thinking I should rest less. Work more, play hard, ready for the encore. Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times). In my heart I know, less is more (more). More (more) , more, more, more. Life goes on with or without you. It's up to you what you're gonna do. You could go or you could stay. Who cares anyway?. Life goes on with or without you. Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?. You could go or you could stay. But who cares anyway?. It's time to take this out of my hands. Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?. 'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone. Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah). But then again this way I'll never know, never know. Maybe I should go. Go crazy, go insane, go for everything. Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching. Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?. The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli. And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly. They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?. Really, really? Really really though?. Really, really, really though?. Feel the vibration of the higher ground. Love always leads to the highest sound. Many conversations, people makin' speculations. As to my procrastination due to my revelations. And then they get fugazi. You call yourself a rider. You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti. Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality. We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari. Life goes on with or without you. It's up to you what you're gonna do. You could go or you could stay. Who cares anyway?. Life goes on with or without you. Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?. You could go or you could stay. But who cares anyway?. Who cares anyway?. You could go or you could stay. You could go, you could stay"

She's got eyes of the bluest skies. As if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes. And see an ounce of pain. Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place. Where as a child I'd hide.

I could be the one you want grow older with, baby. I'll give you all that I got. So I dont mean to scare you now and push you away. Cuz I'm not tryin' to rush anything. But when I look into your eyes I'm not scared to say. I sit near you, I'm in the picture too. Like a happy family tree, we're together costantly. This could be eventually, we'll see, we'll see. But all that I have got to know is with me baby you will grow. Through sun and rain and heavy snow. Oh tell me so now, baby. Would you love me if I didn't work out. or I didn't change my natural hair?. And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby. I'll give you all that I got. (Will.I.Am rap verse).

Cuz when you're on my mind, I just can't think straight. Back to the five and six. I'm all in the mix and I'm all into you. Without the lipstick, without the L'Oreal. You remain the same angel that I fell for, for real, for real. Would you love me if I didn't work out. or I didn't change my natural hair?. And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby.

finally (feat. john legend),"Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream. Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems. Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day. But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes. I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold. This classic story told, I left it in the cold. Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you. Each one unlocking more of the truth. I finally stopped tripping on my youth. I finally got lost inside of you. I finally know I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. I remember the beginning you already knew. I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool. Fronting like it didn't matter. I just ran away, on another face. Was lost in my own space. Found what it's like to hurt selfishly. Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe. I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place. Stumbled through the mess that I have made. Finally got out of my own way. I've finally started living for today. I finally know I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. Finally, finally. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something beautiful is happening, happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. Ohhhhhhh, finally, finally, finally"

finally (feat. john legend),"Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream. Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems. Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day. But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes. I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold. This classic story told, I left it in the cold. Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you. Each one unlocking more of the truth. I finally stopped tripping on my youth. I finally got lost inside of you. I finally know I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. I remember the beginning you already knew. I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool. Fronting like it didn't matter. I just ran away, on another face. Was lost in my own space. Found what it's like to hurt selfishly. Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe. I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place. Stumbled through the mess that I have made. Finally got out of my own way. I've finally started living for today. I finally know I needed to grow. And finally my mate has met my soul. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something strange and new is happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. Finally, finally. Finally. Now my destiny can begin. Though we'll have our differences. Something beautiful is happening, happening. Finally. Now my life doesn't seem so bad. Is the best that I've ever had. Give my love to him finally. Ohhhhhhh, finally, finally, finally"

When I show up and I blow it 'til I'm full up, wait, hold up. Girl up in the mirror. Only one I fear, uh. You say you the realest. I told you I'm the illest. Sick. Sick. Hungry. Starving. Not thirsty. Just hungry. Ambitious. Still hungry. Still hungry. I'm moonwalking on marble floors. Rick Ross, I'm just drippin' sauce. Bitches see me and they all just wave. Rolls Royce and we call this Wraith. I fuck up money like I'm Escobar. Ballin', ballin', Kobe Bryant, that boy living large. No room for medium, that means you thinkin' small. Ferrari, Fergie, switching gears, she rockin' with a boss. I close my eyes, I must be telepathic. Look over haters, tripling my assets. It takes courage to accomplish these things. Fergie's my queen, I'm the king. Now come kiss on our rings. Sick. Sick. Hungry. El Chapo. Starving. Rinzel. Not thirsty. Just hungry. Ferrari Fergie. Ambitious. Still hungry. Still hungry"

And, I'm not concerned with all the politics (?). It's a lot of men I know I could find another one.. Oughta know that I'm always happy. When I walk out the store, store. I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy,. Nothing to be playing with. I love him, hate him, kiss him,. Just I'm trying to walk a mile in my kicks. (Chorus). Love's like a runway but which one do I love more. No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior. Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for. Let's stop chasing them boys and shop some more. I know I might come off as negative. I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love. Relationships are often so hard to tame. A Prada dress has never broken my heart before. And, ballin?s something that I?m fed up. I'mma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing. Cause I know that my credit card will help me put out the flames. I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy,. Nothing to be playing with. I love him, hate him, kiss him,. Just I'm trying to walk a mile in my kicks. [Chorus]. Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer. things. Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them. diamond rings. I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach. Fellas boast but they can't really handle my female approach. Buying things is hard to say. Rocking Christian Audigier, Manolo, Polo, taking. photos in my Cartier. So we can't go all the way, I know you might hate it but. I'm a shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love"

losing my ground,"[Intro]. Don't know what day it is. What's going on?. Is this real?. Oh no, no, no, no, no. [Verse One]. I woke up short of breath,. But I've still got a long day ahead of me. I don't know what day it is. But tell me 'cuz I gotta know who to be. Is that me up in the mirror?. 'Cuz I thought it was somebody else. Well it's a realization, when you find out. You don't even wanna look at yourself. [Chorus]. Where do I go?. What do I do?. Who do I turn to?. I'm losing my ground. Who am I now?. Where does it end?. How did it all begin?. I'm losing my ground. [Verse Two]. Well, hit my feet, it time to hit the streets. And get my life back together again. Well, this place is all a masquerade. So tell me where in line can I cut in?. Downtown wandering aimlessly around. Still don't know what I'm tryin' to find. Well you could flash all the pretty lights. In front of me, I still won't see the signs. [Chorus]. Where do I go?. Who do I turn to?. I'm losing my ground. Who am I now?. Where does it end?. How did it all begin?. I'm losing my ground. I'm losing my. I'm losing my. I'm losing my ground. Where do I go?.

She takes me away to that special place. And if I stare too long. I'll probably break down and cry. Oh, oh, oh. Sweet child o' mine. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Sweet love of mine. She's got eyes of the bluest skies. As if they thought of rain. I hate to look into those eyes. And see an ounce of pain. Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place. Where as a child I'd hide. And pray for the thunder. And the rain. To quietly pass me by. Oh, oh, oh. Sweet child o' mine. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Sweet love of mine. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Sweet child o' mine. Uh, uh, uh, uh. Sweet love of mine. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Where do we go. Where do we go now. Sweet child. Sweet child o' mine"

From over there you could feel my heart (poundin'). Let me swim in your outermind (drownin). Forever I'll be upside down (frownin'). I love you uptown, love ya (downtownin'). You could be my women, and I could be ya main man. And that`s why I sat down and wrote this poem. Cuz I want the truth to be told. Boy you know I know that is true.

Ya I like the way your soul sounds to me. Ain't nobody do me the way you do me. I got the stamina for L-O-V-E. Whip out the camera let`s make a movie. In the future we could look back at what we done did. We'll be makin love til we like a hundred. And that`s why I had to remix this song. Cuz I want the truth to be told. Boy you know I know that is true. Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is true. Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is TRUE. hey hey hey hey hey it's true. my my my my my love is true.
