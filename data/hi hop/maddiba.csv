trash,"The world is defenetaly going insane. I think that the people lose their brains. Turn on your Tv and it all sucks. So many shits thats unvealalivable to trust. 2 teenagers raped a girl with Mental Problems. A dad escapes from a fight with his daughter. Baby is rescued at the sea. Football making friends enemies. That's why I don't turn on the Tv. Cause this shits depresses me. I sit and I think in any kind of salvation. Ways of Thought are the worlds extermination. Let's give a Break Let's give a Pause. Let's destroy it and start with new laws. Fuck!. Get the fuck up!. First Law! Might be respect. share it, and never forget. the Law, might be trust. never to you, never for us. Worlds devastation. Ways of thought. Worlds extermination. Ways of thoughts. World Extermination, killing us all. We need a salvation, who we will call?. Third Law! might be help. take my hand lets escape from this hell. Fourth Law! might be freedom. Positive thoughts transforms you a leader"
