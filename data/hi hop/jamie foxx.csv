fly love,"Wasn't really thinking, wasn't looking,. Wasn't searching for an answer. In the moonlight. When I saw your face. Saw you looking at me,. Saw you peaking out from under moon beams. Through the palm trees. Swaying in the breeze. I know that I'm feeling so much more than ever before. And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do. Don't know how it happened, don't know why,. But you don't really need a reason. When the stars shine. Just to fall in love. Made to love each other, made to be together for a life time. In the sunshine. Flying in the sky. I know that I'm feeling so much more than ever before. And so I'm giving more to you than I though I could do. Now I know love is real. So when sky high, as the angels dry. Letting you and I fly love"
don't let the sun go down,"So many sleepless days and sleepless nights, I spend alone. Wondering if I'll make it, make it on my own, without someone to hold me, with that holding power, if not for a lifetime at least for an hour. But this machine that clicks inside my head oh so cold I'm hanging by a string, never letting go. How my heart breaks, and the tears roll. It's you I'm thinking of, but don't let the sun go down on my love.. Oh....... Sometimes I think I'm falling and no one is concerned. I'm headed down that pathway, the point of no return, but if I had your love, your sweetness my baby my baby, to guide me safely through. I'm absolutely lost when I'm without you. How my heart breaks. How the tears they roll. There's an empty space, inside of my soul. But don't let the sun got down, so many sleepless days and sleepless nights, you know I spend alone, girl I'm left with no one, no one to call my own. But this machine that clicks inside my head, oh so cold my baby, I'm hanging by a string never letting go, how my world's turned around almost to the ground. It's you I'm thinking of, but don't let the sun go down on my love.. Save me.. umm"

Do what it was when you opened the door,. Lets' get the school all night,. I promise it will be all right.. Do you want another 15 minutes, (it don't take long when you know what you're doing). .

any given sunday,"[Guru:]. Though the times are getting wicked I'm older. I got a chip on my shoulder. True players always maintaing, I'm different I told ya. Don't want to be just a commodity. I'm smarter G. This is my life, and my soul not just a chart to me. It's the truest part of me. Fans now mobbing me. Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery. Back then I guess it was hard to see. The real paradox. What an artist see. It's like that saying. Be careful what you pray for you might get it. Of course it's all about winning and money but how far will we let it. Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em. Rain one day sunshine the next. Haters try and stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed. What's next accounted by the press. Mad stress on my chest. Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test. On ""Any Given Sunday"" I got to play my best. [Chorus:]. Sacrifice don't give up the fight,. everything will be all right on any given Sunday. Guru: The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall. Depends on you if you win or lose,. you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday. Guru: Strive to achieve and die for what you believe. [Jamie Foxx:]. On the battlefields left abandoned. One man standing. To me the ball was handed. Taken shots and left stranded,. No defensive they tackle me. Every blow brings back a memory. Learning lessons from my injury. It's killing me. Cause at first they wasn't feeling me. Never given a chance to show my true ability. Too many pressures trying to play me out. Put me positions that's sure to lay me out. No doubt. [Chorus:]. Sacrifice don't give up the fight,. everything will be all right on any given Sunday. Guru: The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall. Depends on you if you win or lose,. you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday. Guru: Strive to achieve and die in for what you believe. [Common:]. Playing on a field of hard times. These struggles are like the yardlines that I gain from. Nowhere is where I came from. >From day one. I knew the game and how to play run. But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons. Now I learn from self when pain comes. And walk when they say run. Fame can be as painful as. Death of patron. Young black, gifted. But I'm rapped in myself. Broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself. See what happens with wealth. At times you can lose yourself. During the sunniest of days many superstars fell. >From Cotton to football fields. You know how they play brothers. As long as we play well they love us. I know that on Any Given Sunday. This can be taken from me. But it all comes down to is money. I know that on Any Given Sunday. This can be taken from me. But it all comes down to is money y'all. [Chorus: (2x)]. Sacrifice don't give up the fight,. everything will be all right on Any Given Sunday. Guru: The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall. Depends on you if you win or lose,. you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday. Guru: Strive to achieve and die for what you believe"

don't let the sun go down,"So many sleepless days and sleepless nights, I spend alone. Wondering if I'll make it, make it on my own, without someone to hold me, with that holding power, if not for a lifetime at least for an hour. But this machine that clicks inside my head oh so cold I'm hanging by a string, never letting go. How my heart breaks, and the tears roll. It's you I'm thinking of, but don't let the sun go down on my love.. Oh....... Sometimes I think I'm falling and no one is concerned. I'm headed down that pathway, the point of no return, but if I had your love, your sweetness my baby my baby, to guide me safely through. I'm absolutely lost when I'm without you. How my heart breaks. How the tears they roll. There's an empty space, inside of my soul. But don't let the sun got down, so many sleepless days and sleepless nights, you know I spend alone, girl I'm left with no one, no one to call my own. But this machine that clicks inside my head, oh so cold my baby, I'm hanging by a string never letting go, how my world's turned around almost to the ground. It's you I'm thinking of, but don't let the sun go down on my love.. Save me.. umm"

She passes me by. As I hopped off the train, this shorty caught my eye. I asked her for her name, she gave me no reply. She left me standin' there, with arrows in my heart. But yet and still I'm wanting her. And later on that week while drivin' in my car. I could have sworn I saw that shorty walkin' out the bar. Cause she passed at me, I was steppin' from afar. Or is my young mind just wishing. I don't know why. She keeps on passin' me by. Maybe her eyes are just on some other guy. And I'll forever be the fella on the side. She passes me by. Come back, come back, come back. It gets so confusing, this game. I met a lot of girls, but never felt this way. I get strange pleasure though, from going through this pain. And like a ghost I'm haunting her. I often fantasize bout walkin' hand in hand. But I don't know her name, or if she's got a man. And the only thing, that gives me hope to stay. Is maybe one day she'll notice me. I don't know why. She keeps on passin' me by. Maybe her eyes are just on some other guy. And I'll forever be the fella on the side. She passes me by. Come back, come back, come back"

We gotta stand up here. Give thanks to the man up stairs. Put the egos and the prides to the side regardless. And just be role models, parents, and artists. We can make a change or make it the hardest. If you gonna make a baby, you should make him the smartest. Let him know good from bad, right from wrong. How to roll wit the punches when life moves on. And the stress won't take toll if you don't sweat it. World won't get no betta if we don't let it. Let the negative energy ride. Keep hope alive it's 'bout time we open our eyes. Wake up.

You got is Maserati's, new Ferrari's, I got one of each. My future bright tight like the bitch died in front of me. Turn pain into progression in every studio session. Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception. Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing. You couldn't die in the hands of a better man. I ran from the bottom to the best, no auto-tune. Been in the lead, you say you seen king follow whom. Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that. King back, money long as a old Cadillac. Hahaha. [Chorus]. I feel like I can't miss. I know they want me to fall. But ain't nothin' bigger than this. So just pass me the ball (It's the king bitch). You know you looking at a. Winner, winner, winner. I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss. You know you looking at a. Winner, winner, winner. Cause I'm a winner. Yeah I'm a winner (Ha ha). [Outro: T.I.]. Ay man, you thought a lil vacation gon' hold me back homeboy. Man I'm back man, brighter than ever, understand that. If you didn't like me then, you gon' hate me now nigga"
wish u were here,"By the time you get this letter, I might be doing better. Its kinda hard trying to survive, in all this crazy weather. Everybody wants my number. Everybody's calling my name. But in the mist of all of this I can still hear you say. ""Son walk up right and straighten your tie. You don't want one of them good jobs to pass you by. Don't act no fool, I'm watching you"". and now that you're gone, it still feels like you do, I wish. Chorus. I wish you were here. To see the things I've done. I wish you were here. You'd be so proud of your son. I wish you were here. To celebrate with me. I wish you were here. Now all of these people ask me, Is it lonely at the top. Or do I find comfort in all the things I got. Well these cars keep me moving. These planes keep me high. A million dollar home, but Im barely getting by cuz. I miss our talks, One thing you used to say. When things got hard, get down on your knees and pray. And then those walks, its just the simple things. We still do all of this, But only in my dreams, I wish. Chorus. I wish you were here. To see the things I've done. I wish you were here. You'd be so proud of your son. I wish you were here. To celebrate with me. I wish you were here. But sometimes I wonder why. why can't you still be here with me. wish God would've waited, a couple more years for you to see. Im trying to stay strong, barely holding on. I know I'll see you again. But for right now rest in peace. And when I get to heaven, first thing they'll say to me. Tell me have you seen Estelle Marie Tallie. Find out where you are. Run into your arms. Wrap your wings around me, and whisper in my ear,"" Well done"". Well....Well done my son, well done. Chorus. I wish you were here. To see the things I've done. I wish you were here. You'd be so proud of your son. I wish you were here. To celebrate with me. I wish you were here"
