All of the time I can't forget to. Tried to forget you in my mine. [Verse 1]. Pretend to not have the patience. Pretend that there is enough time for waiting. Remembering when we kept it all basic. I wanna go back so that I can taste it. What do I care for?. You were not there anymore. I was not careful. That is all your fault. You let me fall. Chorus. Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine. All of the time tried to forget you. Thought I could get you to be mine. Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine. All of the time I can't forget to. Tried to forget you in my mine. [Verse 2]. Buried alive inside a nightmare. Living a life where you're gone. There is no light here. It will be light-years until my mind's clear. I did it all for love. I did it all. I'd trade it all for you. I'd trade it all. But what do I care for?. What are you here for?. If you're not there when I call?. I was not careful. And that's all your fault. You let me fall. Chorus. Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine. All of the time tried to forget you. Thought I could get you to be mine. Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine. All of the time I can't forget to. Tried to forget you in my mine. [Verse 3]. This ain't how it was supposed to be. You and me supposed to be. Remember when it be just me and you in your crib smoking trees. Like it's in control of me. You had a hold on me. Had me so gone baby. Yeah, you had me giving me all of me. Now it's all over, it's all done. Shouldn't have told ya, you're the one. I'll be all right. I will be just fine. I'll be OK. Once you get out my mind. Chorus.

pretty bird,"Yes, this is all I have left in me. Said, she had just, self expressed. Herself to death, now nothing's left. Nothingness. She finessed it. She the best. And I said, and I said. Pretty bird, and I said. Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird. Sounds so pretty when you cry. Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird. You're so pretty, but why I never see you fly?. Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird. Please don't die, please don't die. Pretty bird, pretty bird, I know your hurtin'. Well so am I, so am I. Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird. Please don't cry. You can fly. And there's a blinding light inside of you. There's a blinding light inside of you.

Please don't die, please don't cry. Pretty bird, pretty bird. We need your life, we need your life. The city heard, the sounds of a pretty bird. Yelling from slauson to 53rd. What happens if you holla and can't be heard?. For the birds and the drama, I paint these words. They say through the pain is how we learn. You landed on the window of pain, simple and plain. It's hard for you to fly in the rain. The way love goes is not the way that it came. Come fly, un-die, be born again. I've seen the strongest of them be torn from men. Ripped apart and get put back together. Them the ones with the most beautiful feathers. Lets flock together, rock together, nirvana. A birds persona to be free and honor. The sky, that's when you really most high. Unafraid of the unknown and now we know why. Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird. Let me hear that back"

Wipe it on my shirt, haha I need sleep. You tell me that you wanna do it big. I love when you say ""guess what? "" (What? What?). Reading stories to another nigga kid. And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up). Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes. Being a class act nevermind my alumni. I don't wanna be a round a baby so dumb high. I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides. Curled up with my head on your chest. It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress. If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed. It will be like this to the kiss of the death. Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no. Not a good team, once sold two half's. No joke, who laughs?. Just us (Just us, just us). (Verso 4: Jhene Aiko).

Pride set aside, third eye winking at me. My what a ride, real trippy shit. I glimpse with a squint but I can see a whole grip. My retinas red, my vision is crystal. Didn't use pencil but it's true I led. My way to this sedated state of mind I always dread. My daddy did it this is the state of mind I always had. I'm mad he died before we got to have a man to man. I got two packs of sweet aromatics and 14 grams. So I take a deep breath, Puff, puff, pass. Part of my paranoia, I'm just a product of my past. I show you how to let your soul sail. Sparking lala, talking to Allah. (Might of got way too high). [Hook]. I might. I might've got way too high"

I'm always available. Rollin' in my ride. So I gotta take it slow. You got me so high. Up, up and away we go. Racing to the sky. I'm feel unfadable. Cuz the vapors. Can save us. And take us. And make us believe. That we are free. We can be free. So can I please. [Hook]. Can I hit it again?. Can I hit it again?. Can I hit it again?. Can I hit it again?. (x2). [Verse 3: Vince Staples]. Please don't rain on my parade. The falling from the sky just remind of the days. When you was crying for attention. I ignored it as a phase. Until you couldn't take the tension. Now I wish you would have stayed. Walking through the smoke and mirrors, I'm burdened, you burning bridges. Memories fading faded it help you not to remember. The trials and tribulations, eyes red from crying. The perfect way to disguise it you was blinded by our fate. Please don't rain on my parade because this float was built for you. Kinda hard to chase you down when you floating through the room. All you wanted was the truth and all I wanted was my way. Regardless how I word the phrase all you hear me say is. [Hook]. Can I hit it again?. Can I hit it again?. Can I hit it again?. Can I hit it again?. (x2)"

july (feat. drake),"[Verse 1: Drake]. This verse start's as my sniper hits they mark. And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart. Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow. I know you had your fears, you can let 'em all go. And most women are motivated so I act accordingly. But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me. Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be. I provide protection if you open up the door for me. Couple stares. Couple text. Couple dates. Couple I think that we're readys. Couple I think that we should we waits. Are we actin' like a couple. I'm just tryin' to get it straight. Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes. [Bridge: Jhene Aiko].

I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know. Had you over every night. Every night was passionate. Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident. I'm confused tell me where we go wrong. I was sure that I would be with you for so long. I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning. Energy invested in someone I saw potential in. Who killed chivalry. They need to get they sentencin'. Meanwhile we arguing and I can't get a sentence in. And just as I predicted here we go again. They always say the hottest love has the coldest end. [Bridge]. [Jhene Aiko]. See it's funny cause I never thought this would end. But then the season changed. [Drake]. You were my, you were my, you were my love. Shoulda made, shoulda made you my world. Shoula done everything to make you happy, baby. Oh yeah. [Jhene Aiko].

stay ready (what a life) (feat. kendrick lamar),"[Part 1: Stay Ready]. [Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]. We do not exist in. Any other instant. Here in this dimension. You and I are meant to be. I have waited lifetimes to find you. Now that you're here. I can remind you. Of the things you've been dreamin'. Times two. I promise you. If you just give me 24. Man, all I need is 24 hours. I promise you'll want plenty more. You've probably been waiting forever. So how does it sound. Us on the ground. Giving you my love?. [Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]. There's no place quite like here. There's no better time than now. You gotta stay ready. There's no place quite like here. There's no better time than now. That's why I stay ready. [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar].

I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip. I'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate. But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy. And yea, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me. I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy. We gon' fuck around (MM) , we gon' fuck around. And triple through triplets of babies right now. And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile. That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection. I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored. We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored. I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up. Then I wish you good luck on the seas that's inside this wall. [Bridge: Jhene Aiko and Kendrick Lamar]. Come to me, come, come to me. Look at what you've done to me. You put a gun to me. Then you brought the sun to me. [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]. Shine like blood diamonds. Learning to have patience only cause you are timeless. The universe energy doesn't lie. And this chemistry is infinity at a million times. I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power. And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours. [Hook 1]. [Bridge (x2) : Jhene Aiko]. All that I know is right now. Nothing's for sure but, right now. Gotta get yours like, right now. [Part 2: What A Life]. [Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]. I been through some shit man. But I be on my shit man.

You steady always on the go. We steady losin all control. [Hook 2: Jhene Aiko]. What a life (x4). [Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]. They say. The truth ain't pretty. But comin from that pretty mouth. The truth is fitting. Cuz you ain't never talkin lout. And you know plenty. Yea you know what I'm talkin bout. Cuz you just get me. Yea you so pretty. If everything is dipped in gold. Then baby it will never grow. Everything sweet ain't sugar coated. [Outro: Jhene Aiko]. What a life (x5). What a life that I've been given. What a life. What a life that I've been living.

Now I wish you would have stayed. Walking through the smoke and mirrors, I'm burdened, you burning bridges. Memories fading faded it help you not to remember. The trials and tribulations, eyes red from crying. The perfect way to disguise it you was blinded by our fate. Please don't rain on my parade because this float was built for you. Kinda hard to chase you down when you floating through the room. All you wanted was the truth and all I wanted was my way. Regardless how I word the phrase all you hear me say is. [Hook].
