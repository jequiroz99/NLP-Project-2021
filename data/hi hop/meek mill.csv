So I had to grind like that to shine like this. In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit. In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists. See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true. It was time to marry the game and I said, ""Yeah, I do"". If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view. Got a shorty, she try'na bless me like I said, ""Achoo"". Like a nigga sneezed,. nigga please before them triggers squeeze. I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between. Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted.

Got foreign bitches menaging, fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'. Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em. I did it without an album. I did shit with Mariah. Lil' nigga I'm on fire.

They shot that boy twenty times when they coulda told him just freeze. Coulda put him in a cop car, but they let him just bleed. ""The ambulance, it comin' baby, just breathe"". That's what the old lady said when she screamed. It's Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th. And in the 13th Amendment, it don't say that we kings. It say we legally slaves if we go to the pen. They told Kaep ""Stand up, you wanna play for a team"". And all his teammates ain't saying a thing (Stay woke). If you don't stand for nothin', you gon' fall for somethin'. And in the 60's, if you kneeled, you'd probably be killed. But they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal. Kill your account, liquid money gets spilled (Check it).

1942 flows,"Started off poor with plans to earn more. Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores. I was on tour with niggas that sold raw. Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more. I'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us. Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough. Cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her. New dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up. Just to get to kill 'em softly. Ooh, get them off me, try to crucify me. Like I'm Jesus the way she cross me. I'm too bossy and too thorough to move like a weirdo. On point like an arrow, we started off with zero. Now I'm seeing M's, diamonds like water. And they jumping out the gym. Shooting like Harden if your head was the rim. 'Cause niggas wanna line me. like a shape up in the trim, damn. Back when I was broke, they was cool with it. Now every move I make, I'm in the news with it. Even if I ain't do it, they be like, you did it. My teacher always used to tell me you gon' lose nigga. That's why I never went to school nigga. And why I'm rappin' like I got something to prove nigga. Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it. Billy with the stamp, I get two with it'. Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life. No weapon formed against me, every time I pray at night. Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life. And make them fuck their best friends. like they was dykes. Reaching for the Glock, every time I play the light. I'm on 12 o'clock, every time I play them bikes. I'm with the pack, huh. Getting back, yeah. Spend dope, nigga. Selling smack, gang. I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks. Yeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika that's a fact. Money, power, respect. Eating breakfast on a jet. I know these niggas upset. They ain't see me fall yet. Wins and losses. They wanna see me fall. And I will never sell my soul. I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before. Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals. I don't need these hoes. I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes. Play with me, you know is all out war. The young niggas goin' all out for us. Bloggers in the frenzy, truck to the Bentley. Ain't doing no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty. So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki. Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy. Niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends. 40 bust your windows out, Jazmine Sullivan. They told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings. Sipping 1942 like it's lean. I done seen all these niggas try to down play my dreams. So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene. Pull up, Ghost, Ghost, Wraith, Wraith when you see me. Some suckers wanna be me. and some suckers wanna live me, I know it. I go through it, don't' show it. I told niggas who wrote it, ain't taking back what I quoted. Started off with a quarter. flipped that to a half, turned that to an ounce. Got some shit in the stash. nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass. Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass. And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag. Had to starve all day just to get to it fast. Like Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine. Real niggas in my ambiance, bottom line. Ever since I met Ross and signed a dotted line. I gave my mama ten thousand at least a thousand times. Do the math on it. They wanna see me fall. And I will never sell my soul. I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before. Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals. I don't need these hoes. I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes. Play with me, you know is all out war. The young niggas goin' all out for us. Talking, this my cocky flow. Damn Daniel, why you son him, Mr Miyagi though. This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94. Mean nothin' to me, I tell how I gotta go rain slick. On that corner when the block was slow. Everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though. Heard that bitch say she cut me, I was like adi√≥s. In the field, knock 'em down. it look like dominoes, young nigga. I turn my Impala to a Wraith. when you get a dollar they gon' hate. Bought my mom the crib with that gate. Private school for all them babies. Now they straight, nigga. They wanna see me fall. And I will never sell my soul. I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before. Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals. I don't need these hoes. I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes. Play with me, you know is all out war. The young niggas goin' all out for us. At the dealership, dream car, spent the cash on it. Got my dream girl, riding on me, from the back on it. Ever slide through your old hood, paper tag on it?. Pin me at the bottom, so my hood gon' brag for me. Heard they say I talk about my Rollies too much. But them flows you be using sounding stolen too much. 500 on my neck, they say I'm glowing too much. Had to block that little bitch because she blowing me up. You be doing too much, you only looking for attention. Swaggerjacking, jacking niggas' swag, that's extensious. Came in the culture like a vulture, now you winning. But this is just the beginning. Double M the emblem, for real"
respect the game,"Yah. Big bag, got 'em big mad. A nigga gettin' to some money and his bitch bad. Jumpin' out the Rolls truck with the temp tag. I'm gettin' money, I don't get mad, ugh. Ask a nigga in my hood, he go and said it on stand. And when them situations came, I came out like a champ. When it was pourin' down rain and I came out of it damp. But now it's champagne showers. when we poppin' the champ', ugh. We dodged all the feds and they traps. Niggas can't be us 'cause they rats. Stand tall, point a finger, never that. I knew a nigga had it all, went to the B, ain't get it back. That's why I'm humble as ever, and I rumble whatever. Don't chase hoes 'cause they come with this cheddar. I seen my man girl start actin' bougie when he fuck up his cheddar. Before you knew it, niggas was fuckin' her better. I knew about it and I. Wanted to tell him, I felt funny as ever. But when I told him, he went runnin' to tell her, damn. Remember I was down bad, I'm talkin' under the cellar. Now the Rolls Royces come with umbrellas. For the rain and all the pain that we been through. If you don't feed your wolves they gon' put you on the menu. That's why I be with family and some bulls that I been knew. If money determined loyalty, we'd cut you with a Ginsu. Now I go against you, facts. Rule number one, never count your homie pockets. thinkin' you deserve it. Rule number two, never trust a bitch. that'll fuck you for some purses. Rule number three, save you some of that money. shit you better stop splurgin'. 'Cause when it's all said and done. and you back at the bottom, they gon' treat you like you worthless. Respect the game. Fuck the fame. We millionaires fuck your watch and lil' chain. Niggas disappear as quick as Lil Xan. You feelin' yourself, I know you got a lil' lane. Just hold your composure. I seen this shit happen over and over. That couple hundred thousand holdin' you over. That ain't real money. That's bill money, buy a Rollie, get a wheel money. Catch a case, pay a lawyer, take a deal money. Now you tapped out and got no appeal money. Callin' home like niggas done did you wrong. But when you had that money you could've put niggas on. And the moment they put cuffs on you, your bitch was gone. Student of the game, I'm just ahead of my class. I'm that nigga, but I never got my head up my ass. You doin' good, but I'm ready for bad. And you won't never catch me frontin'. 'cause I'm used to bein' second to last. Respect the game. Rule number one, never count your homie pockets. thinkin' you deserve it. Rule number two, never trust a bitch. that'll fuck you for some purses. Rule number three, save you some of that money. shit you better stop splurgin'. 'Cause when it's all said and done. and you back at the bottom. they gon' treat you like you worthless. Respect the game"
the trillest,"[Hook: Meek Mill]. Was the money good? Was em bitches bad?. Was them fuckin' good?. Did your hood show you love? did the hoes say you fly?. If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky. For the trillest, for the trillest. As the champagne pours and the campaign roars. And the lights shine bright every night that plug. for the trillest. [Verse 1: Meek Mill]. See my momma cry too many tears. And we been broke like too many years. It ain't too many kids, a couple homies. there ain't too many there. And they all gotta eat, they got too many kids. To many kids with no fathers, doing too many bids. Too many bids, just gave 'em kids too many years. As soon as you get that money, that's sooner they appear. Some [?] as soon as you share. And yeah, I've been losin' touch with my family. it ain't the same. I should've gave my sister some money, but I made it rain. I should've hit the crib with my son and play a game. But instead I ended up at the jeweler to make a chain. It's saying saying when you make money. it make you change. Like four quarters, the fourth quarter, I made a lane. Shit, I had to walk forward they talkin' 'bout takin' trains. And takin' planes, I put the work in and made a name. But the question is. [Hook: Meek Mill]. Was the money good? Was them bitches bad?. was they fuckin' good?. Did your hood show you love? did the hoes say you fly?. If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky. For the trillest, for the trillest. As the champagne pours and the campaign roars. And the lights shine bright. every night that plug, for the trillest. [Verse 2: Meek Mill]. I never wanted to be like Mike, I wanted to be like Mitch. Now all the lil' niggas wanna be like this. I wear my chain in any city, let you see my shit. Cause I earned that, it's on me, I'mma keep that shit. I got blood on my money, ether in my soul. Do you know the feeling durin' Easter with no clothes?. Now it's stars in the ceiling, bringing ether out the rose. With the curtains on the windows. I'm just peepin' at my ghost. Money made me iller, already was realer. Young kings killin', young kings over skrilla. That's why I ride around mac on me like I was Miller. Or Reggie when I shoot for that three. They drop fetty, that's good money. Come to my city, we talk heavy and die young. When we get some paper, we cop Prezis [?]. 20 inch rims for the dope boy. Sellin' that coke boy, trappin' on your note boy. Got that [?] off money, fuck I need a note for!. In them school hallways like ""fuck I need a note for! "". We ain't wanna go to class, was sellin' coke raw. The principal was coppa too, hit him with a snowball. [Hook: Meek Mill]. Was the money good? Was them bitches bad?. was they fuckin' good?. Did your hood show you love? did the hoes say you fly?. If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky. For the trillest, for the trillest. As the champagne pours and the campaign roars. And the lights shine bright every night that plug. for the trillest. [Verse 3: Meek Mill]. Lookin' for that intro I was at the dealer. lookin' for another Benzo. Match kicks with my Kenzo, young nigga. Heart of a lion, hungry as hippo. When I was on my last, nobody ain't tell me shit though. Flow slicker than Crisco, niggas talkin', I get low. Do my thing, they jump back, know how that shit go. And they still say I'm arrogant. I'm still eatin' steak with the asparagus. When I get that money like I married it. 1 milly, 2 milly, 3 milly, buried it. Since they say I'm underground, I run that bitch like Harriet. Rolls Royce pushin' real slow like a chariot. Pull up on 'em niggas that got to me, shit, embarrassin'. I'mma real nigga with money, never trash it. You a fake niggas with money, it's no comparison. Told me that I couldn't get signed when I was rappin' it. And told me I couldn't do songs when I was battlin'. They told me that I couldn't be trap, I started trappin' it. Never listen to 'em, oh well, shit is Immaculate. I'mma just go sit up in this back again. Smoke the weed and laugh at 'em. Make a couple million by accident. Couple niggas dropped on Twitter say they back again. Couple months later on Twitter they say us laxative. Shitted on 'em Nicky voice, did it on 'em Benjamins. Plently of 'em Benjamins, semi on 'em a many on a. Whole 'nother level from before now. Tell my niggas when I see a hundred mil its going down. When I made my first mil, I was like ""it's on now"". Then I made my second mil, money on the floor now. Then I made my third mil, I'm like ""I need more now? "". I got in my zone and that money started pourin' down. Every time I hit the booth, microphone torn down. We couldn't get a pair of Pumas. we up in the store now, bitches!"

ambition,"The time is now on everything. Took my heart away from money, I ain't interested in fame. And I pray that never change. Ambition is priceless, it's something that's in your veins. And I put that on my name. Uh, the only hope I had was selling dope. Was on my grind cause times were harder. than the cellar floor. My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks. I grew up looking at the niggas that was selling coke. Oh, I was raised by the stop sign. No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine. By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line. Servin' rollin' fiends was calling, we was dot com. Well connected, well respected and well protected. Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it. Aint get my message, was a signal when I was texting. The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson. Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon. Cause chances are never given. they tooken like interceptions. So throw that pass, I'll be the corner back. Me and Folarin Mmg gon bring that Warner back. For my ambition. Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it. They gon love me for my Ambition. Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it. They gon love me for my Ambition. Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it. Look, they gon love me for my ambition. Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision. (It speaks for itself. Define Ambition for me?). My ambition to win, just to get me some ends. Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz. I saw momma praying as she wait on results. It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch. My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North. Life was diggin' me deeper, I kept on coming up short. Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark. Who cut my power off? It's time to move that powder soft. Not too many options when you coming from the projects. Sittin' in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper. Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change. And I doubt that ever change. Ambition is priceless that's something thats in your veins. And I doubt that ever change. Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name. And I doubt that ever change. Well wishes to my opposition. You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol. I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential. But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue. Subscribe niggas reside where all the lions and killers be. And I aint spend a minute up in the streets. But I'm limitless mentally, I'm lyrically the Mc. Lebron shit, I was heading six after twenty three. And family is everything and money is less important. Long as your mama love you, don't ever love a woman. I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings. But I got that green on my eyes. And that ain't no Donnie Simpson. I retire you niggas, fuck you and your position!. They play surface so slippery niggas can't even kick it. Y'all rambling, talking shit to these bitches. You know you real you don't say it. You know you real, we gon feel it. Ralph!. Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision. They gon' love me for my ambition. Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it. Look, they gon' love me for my ambition. Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision. They gon' love me for my ambition"

We just tried to fix the roof leak when it was rainin'. We just tried to keep the house warm when winter came in. But they rub the detainers, lockers and cells of strangers, the razors. The animal go in cages, that's what the slave masters told the workers when they slaved us. Small city, big dreams. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16. Since I was 16. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16. Small city, big dreams. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16. Since I was 16. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16. Rock man told us sun don't shine. You know of his daddy I said in a similar grind. His father was locked up, now the son doin' time. Well certain niggas go to starvin' knowin' gang gon shine. Two felonies on his record, he got one more time. Get that, push that, he don't want no job, lost hope. Some niggas don't even want no god. They just want a little money just to come through fly. Cuz nobody ever listens to the broke nigga. Cuz when you broke, be considered as a joke nigga. If you a joke, you consider as a hoe nigga. And no nigga wanna live like livin' poke nigga. Small city, big dreams. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16. Saw this white girl, I'm talkin' Christine. Young boy with dreams touching that big screen. Small city, big dreams. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16. Since I was 16. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16. Small city, big dreams. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16. Since I was 16. I've been waiting on this day since I was 16"

Drive by wet you up, nigga thats a carpool. Spitting all this hot shit, every single bar cool. Diamonds in the rollie face, animated cartoon. Call me Meek Milly I don't play that shit. Got me on my nappy braids before the Maybach clique. Riding in the wheels of fortune, Pat Sajak shit. And all I rock is Balmain like I made that shit. I've been, front row fashion week. Looking like I'm in the show. Sitting in the foreign leather, softer than a dinner roll. Make a movie on your bitch, tell her friend to get a role. You thought she was innocent. We laughing like she been a ho. Chopping up those benzos. Me yo bitch in the friend zone. She told you I was friendzoned, what?. I'm in the endzone. Touchdown with a 2 point conversion. Give her that dick long. She busting like the clip long. Uber to send your bitch home nigga. [Swizz Beats:]. I got a fever bitch, hot outside I got a fever bitch. Feeling sick I gotta fever bitch. In these philly streets situations is. Police ain't respecting the youth and. The youth ain't respecting the truth and. The Glock 9 on me in the booth and. All I talk is that real shit the truth and. [Meek Mill:]. The money turned your bitch into a gold digger. The money got me feeling like the old Jigga. And Jigga even told me you a cold nigga. They ain't believe me I was broke. But I showed niggas and I told niggas. That I would dispose niggas. Went to buy a pair of sneaks. Landed at the rawest dealer. Brand new paper tag. Haters never made me mad. You get at your baby momma. I'm flyer than her baby dad. Looking at my neck. What that cost? Hundred-eighty cash. Looking at my bitch, she remind me of a Stacey Dash. We was selling rock before Kareem Biggs, Dame and Dash. Oh you think you fly with your lil' dream chasin' ass?. We don't chase bitches, we chase money and that (D'uss√©). Cause when you get money, the hoes do whatever you say. Riding in a drop head, Phantom with the toupe. And if you're just hearing this, then it's probably too late. [Swizz Beats:].

cold hearted (feat. puff daddy),"Yeah, yeah. I never had a role model. I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40. A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning. And I think it was December when they swarmed me. Niggas is jealous, fuck can they tell us. With them dreams they try to sell us? Probably why I'm rebellious. To the fraud niggas, I lost niggas when I got paper. It's like more money I made they got faker. And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater. Wanna roll up and smoke you like top paper. Damn, what a feeling when you and your homie chilling and. You know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you. Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you. And stay away from them haters cause they'll riddle you. Last year was like a bad year. Even though I touched more paper than a cashier. Small circle, I ain't never really 'round squares. They say there's levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs. Different floors for different bosses. Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw. Different city with different bitches and different whores. Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly, this your car?. Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm. And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw. When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball. I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall. And that was and-one, they thinking how we get this far?. We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss. They couldn't D me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft. Tried to pick me off like Champ Bailey but I'm Randy Moss. And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?. Gold Ap all bust down, fuck clowns. My heart getting cold. Then the streets getting colder. They said I would't make it no way. I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold. Told them I would make it one day. Only Lord knows. Dedicated, de-terminated and disciplined. When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking I'm listening. When I be in the jungle the Devil be whispering. Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling, that was a close call. Stand up nigga so I won't fall. My teacher told me I would never go far. Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur. I was like ""told y'all"". Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter. So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger. Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger. Cause if he catch you sleeping he's going ""I got your medulla oblongata"". I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of. If I don't get he gon' probably end up with a chopper. In a field out in Philly do you feel me?. Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me. Getting high even though it might derail me. And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?. Times change like the Rollie did. Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did. [Diddy:]. Ayo. It gets fucked up when your own family start calling you out. Shit, money's the root of all evil. Family start telling you ""you acting different nigga"". You're goddamn right I'm acting different. With all this motherfucking money. But then when it comes from your brother, your sister, your mother, your father. That shit hurts you to the core man. When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen you done grew up motherfucker. They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?. You got raised, you done played in the park with them. This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man. You got to watch what you ask for. You sure you want this son?. You sure you want this money?. You sure you want this fame?. You sure you want this power?. Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit. Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers. Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them. Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?. Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got. Don't let this money bring us down. Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats lets go. Uh, yeah. And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs. And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live. I remember Sundays we ain't have nothing but Liv. Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give. I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip. I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?. Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick. And your main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit. Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist. When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit. I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga. Like Kobe Bryant, Metta Peace and Gasol, nigga. But I know just what I saw nigga. It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it. The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit. You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit. Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth. Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight. As long as Poppi smiling. Imma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot. I've seen it, I've seen it. Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving. And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it. You said you would ride but shit I know you ain't mean it. But yeah nigga I've seen it. My heart getting cold. Then the streets getting colder. They said I wouldn't make it no way. I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold. Told them I would make it one day. Young lord knows"
cold hearted ii,"Woah, don't you, baby, hey. It won't matter, baby. Don't you know?. Don't you know?. Woah, don't you, baby, hey. It won't matter, baby. Don't you know?. Don't you know?. Uh, make it out the hood, they say you Hollywood. How dare you niggas tell me that I got it good. Gotta check and treat these niggas like I'm Robin Hood. When it was time to stand up for me, see, nobody stood. And I was lookin' at you niggas, all the ones I fed. Had me grindin' all them nights you was going to bed. And if I think I owe you something, nigga gon' ahead. Treat you like I never knew you, put it on your head. And I got Papi on my line like, 'When you comin' home? '. My mama see it in my face, she know that somethin' wrong. Bodies droppin' in my city all summer long. Out on bail but I still gotta keep somethin' on. 'Cause I can't let 'em take my life. you might get left you make that right. When he got left it wasn't right, but he was tryna live that life. I call up Coon to book that jet. we like three deep, we take that flight. Used to land in California. to play that studio all night, we stayin' down. For the love of them millions, ain't layin' down. Left you in the hood, what you sayin' now?. And niggas wanted the smoke, you said, ""Stand down, "" uh. Cold heart, never get cold feet when the pressure come. It was beef, I had to tell niggas, ""You better come"". Sister said they gettin' over, it's like you lettin' them. Some shit I had to learn my lesson from, uh. Checkin' in, checkin' out, I just had to check you out. 2012, it was 50 niggas when I'm steppin' out. Forgot the time you asked me for a check. and I ain't lived it out. I ain't even know you was upset, this what this shit about?. A green piece of paper can turn you to a hater. When you can't bring up one time. you returned me for a favor. So I play these niggas real close. talkin' closer than my neighbors. 'Cause I know the signs. when niggas switch sides, catch them vapors. Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty. Scream, ""Ride or die, "" I thought you would ride with me. Found out you was jealous, you wouldn't even grind with me. And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550. Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty. Scream, ""Ride or die, "" I thought you would ride with me. Found out you was jealous, you wouldn't even grind with me. And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550. See, I look at it like this. What I'm supposed to spend. a thousand nights in the studio rappin' my lights out?. Goin' city to city, can't take my son to school when I want to. Can't see my mama, my family when I want to. They give a nigga my money. they act like he hangin' with me. I ain't ever been sweet. Far as I can remember, every time. I went to jail I had to stand up in that bitch by myself. I ain't never even think about a nigga. callin' my baby mama to pick my son. up to take him to the movies. Go play basketball while I'm doin' this time in the cell. Actin' like I owe you somethin'. See, it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends. Turn their back on me about that attention needle. Or a green piece of paper. with a slave master on the front of that shit. I used to hear niggas, niggas. that I was feedin', I heard 'em whisperin'. ""Meek Mill finished"". I was like, ""And damn, I was feedin' you, bro"". All I did was keep grindin'. Through the storm, nigga. I'm like Derrick Rose on a 50-point night. On a daily basis, nigga. For the love of the millions, royalty over loyalty. never get it confused. I got real friends and family. that'll never turn their back on me for the love of the money. I got a homie that's doin' life. He can't offer me no money. he can't offer me nothin' but a friendship and a relationship. I talk to him seven days a week. So don't come to me talkin' 'bout no money shit, nigga. So if you feel some type of way about my money. We goin' to the furthest extent. to protect that plate. that goes under my son on the table, nigga. One love to all my family and friends. that stayed down through all the madness. While I had to sacrifice and put it all on the line. One time for my mom and sister. that never changed on me, even before I had money. Ride or die, no matter what. Dreamchasers for life, you dig?. Uh, I told niggas stop askin' me where niggas at. If you don't see 'em in the pictures with me. that mean they faded away. I got my niggas out dissin' myself, fun. we love each other, it's all love but. Everybody can't make it. Niggas wanna burn a bridge. and expect you to send a yacht, huh?. Where they do that at?"

Caught a couple cases, went to jail but I ain't going back. FREE TIP!"

in god we trust,"[Intro]. See most of y'all sucka ass niggas. wouldn't last a week in my hood if you was broke. And wouldn't last a day if you had money. I seen grown men cry, grown men die, for the love of that money. In God we trust!. [Verse 1]. My trigger finger itchin', palms itchin' too. We back-to-back in Ghosts, playin' peek-a-boo. We went to war with Sosa over a brick or two. So for a hundred ki's, think what my clique could do. I'm talkin' clappin' toasts, bullets'll hit your roof. They hit his body he went in shock, no Pikachu. Niggas ain't bout it they talkin' but really pick and choose. We on our second strike, we ain't got shit to lose. All my niggas is felons, all you niggas is tellin'. Sold your soul to them people, they gon' get you to sell it. They gon' get you to move it, they gon' get you a Buick. They gon' get you a wire, like niggas gon' use it. You gon' tell on your brothas, what a lame homie. I got a bullet with your name on it, and a full clip I autographed. Kids cryin' at the viewing, I guess it was upset. [Hook]. We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best. Talkin' high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess. I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold. I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told. For the love of the money, for the love of the money. For the love of the money, love of the money. Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money. I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit.

But he got killers lurkin' outside at your home tonight. They gon' hit the crib and kill the kids, oh that's Kony right. Oh that's Kony-like, everybody bleed. Cuz he come out in 2060, Christmas Eve. First time he went to prison he ain't get to leave. Feds takin' pictures, niggas is rats, you should say cheese. Once a local dude, shit the fire now. Never ever spit a rap but he got bars now. I'm talkin fed time, yard up, yard down. Baby mama can't pay the bills, shit is hard now. How that make you feel, you should pay them bills. MA spittin in them trays when they make yo' meal. Niggas shittin' out them packs just to take them pills. And his baby mama brought em in, boy this shit is real. Niggas turn to Muslim, niggas turn to Christian. They gave him life, he try'n appeal it, got him on a mission. His homies ain't learn, they still in the kitchen. They firin' bullshit, that coka ain't swimmin'. It's coming up short, no food on the fork. Niggas is catchin' cases, niggas is goin' to court. He done slaved in the field, you the one on the porch. With the gun in your hand, try and run with the man. [Hook]. We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best. Talkin' high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess.

For the love of the money, love of the money. Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money. I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit. I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch. In God we trust. [Outro]. Hey look, I'ma tell you like this. If you in school nigga, stay in school. If you got a job nigga, stay at work. If you a family man, stay with your muhfuckin' family nigga. Cuz this shit ain't meant for everybody dawg. Everybody talk that shit, until they get caught up in some real shit. And then they start talkin' that shit. [Hook]. We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best. Talkin' high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess. I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold. I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told. For the love of the money, for the love of the money. For the love of the money, love of the money. Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money. I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit.

Everytime I come through nigga. I put a lion in the front and a camel in the back. Shit my party was a zoo nigga. You don't even have a clue nigga. You don't know no better. Tryna snatch my chain. catch a whole full clip in your polo sweater. I'm a cold go go getter, that's your ho then go get her. Before she end up with some real niggas like us.

last breath,"Nigga, long as you livin' how you wanna live. Niggas gon' talk about you. And that's completely fine with me. (Believe that, nigga). Niggas only salute niggas that's dead. and niggas in prison (Living legends). I wanna ball though. I'm ballin' til my very last breath. I'm ballin' til my very last breath. Just bought me a yacht, Waikiki or not. Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block. I'm ballin' til my very last breath. I'm ballin' til my very last breath. Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls. I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes. I got a house on my neck, my Panamera my pet. We bought ringside seats, and got a brick I can pet. Money, power respect, I took your bitch with finesse. Chickens jumping like checkers, but this game is chess. What's at stake is your freedom, niggas paying the price. When the judge drop the mallet, all he said was life. Nigga damn near fainted, barely stare at your wife. Brother took all your clothes, whip, sneakers, and ice. Got me holding my nuts, while I'm rolling the dice. 760 new Beamer, got me rolling in white. Very few that you trust, better keep in your sight. Thinking I'm doing wrong, when these niggas ain't right. I just scooped me a Bm. And bought me a Rolls. When I pulled up on niggas, I swear they thought I was Hov. All my mixtapes platinum, niggas thought I was gold. I heard them suckas was hatin', I'm fucking all of they hoes. So I don't blame 'em, no I don't knock 'em. But if they play my dogs, we slay 'em, I'm talkin' pop 'em. Want some attention, hall-of-fame 'em, they talkin' bout us. Acting like bitches 'til we spray 'em, get the coffin out ya. We all about it, ahh. I'm ballin' till my very last breath. I hustle like I'm on my last check!. And I ain't even in my bag yet. I wake up in the morning, where the cash at, Go!. All I see is this money, never hate with your niggas. Better pray to your maker, before you war with the sinner. Ask forgiveness for mine, so I know that I'm good. All them niggas we robbed, trips T man took. Talkin' panhandle pimpin, niggas Chevy was lemon. Nigga dressing in linen, bases loaded first inning. Taking over the checks, relocating the tenants. Pulling open your vest, motivation is spinach. I gotta handle my business, I pay my mortgages first. When you cross a super-soaker I bet your water get burst. Ain't no love on this side, just jealous niggas who ride. Until the day that you die, just hold your head to the sky. Ballin' till my last breath. Uptown, flashy life with my Smith & Wess. Hallways, choppa boys everyday. Spend your bank full of hundred B's in your face. My lil nephew was a born killa. Real nigga on the field, killa kill nigga. 'Til I showed him how to cook a bird. Killa nigga nigga only if I finna work. Matches up in every town. Puttin' it down, hold it down for my fuckin' rounds. All day gunplay, everyday rocked out nigga in every way"

I came to put you down shorty so what the fuck is up. Since I met her she can't keep that pussy off me. On the pill, I'mma kill that pussy softly. Back to back time to show you how a gangster move. Keys to the pad, talkin' infinity pools. V12's ain't a thang, time to change your name. Paper stuffed in her purse can't hear her phone ring. [Hook]. [Verse 3 ‚Äì Wale]. Homie picture me rollin', all them bitches be on me. They be fishin' for compliments, I'm just fishin' off Boca. Made a grip off them vocals, got a gift with the vocals.

When it come to showin', I am working with totem pole. That's head on head, she give me head, I give her glow. I'm in her body, I'm in her head like quote unquote. The coldest flow, the flyest combination was voila. Au revoir to my rivals, double M genius shotta. [Hook]. [Verse 4 ‚Äì Trey Songz]. From the night to the morn', yeah she tryna lay.

lord knows,"[Hook: Tory Lanez]. All I wanted was a new Mercedes. Bending off the corner whipping out the lot I got it. Women love me but the niggas hate it.

Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows. [Meek Mill]. Lord knows I'm filthy rich. All this ice is like 50 bricks. Rap niggas throwing hissy fits. I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift. My bitch so bad she on my Christmas list. Remember I prayed I really wished for this. To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence. I with some niggas that remember. we took some risks for this. I'm talking risky business flick the wrist. Lord knows that I repent for this. But Lord knows that if I get penned for this. I prolly won't get home until I'm 56. They said I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars. I sign up at church just to rap at the choir. They spit my new verse at your wake while your lying. The middle the Chruch [?]. I just came from jail, ain't do no crime. They put me through hell sharpened my iron. I did not put trust in and I rode with the lion. Like hold up. From balling I'm tired. I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit. Man they tell me be humble I'm cocky as hell. Shout out my bitches that answered my calls. when I called to collect cause it got me through hell. Shout out that judge that denied me my bail. It made me smarter and made me go harder. They locked me up and slowed my album up. but I did not give up. Cause I knew I would prevail. Came in the game Philly as shit. Look at these rappers they silly as shit. I do not know why they be gassing. these suckers but fuck because I am not feeling their shit. Difference between me and most of these rappers. I'm talking about work that I really put in. Talking about pistols I put on my hip. I'm talking about foreigns. I really could whip, that I really done drove. Really was froze in my hood and these bitches. I really did hit. Really was chose came up from nothing. and now they like how he make millions so quick. I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa. I done seen bitches fucking on over. In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa. A brick on the table ain't sniffing no Coca. No way. [Hook: Tory Lanez].

"maybach curtains (feat. john legend, nas & rick ross)","[Hook: John Legend]. Look how far we came. Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign. Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream. Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed. [Intro: Meek Mill]. I think I'mma dedicate this one. To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here. Dreamchasers. [Verse 1: Meek Mill]. Yeah, it was all a dream. On the corner servin' all them fiends. Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team. The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings. Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame. And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains. When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame. So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'. Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition. Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams. Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine. And this money shit ain't funny, all the shit it brings. You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean. And birthdays was the worst days. Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday. And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day. Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace. Philly, we back!. [Hook]. [Verse 2: Nas]. I'm blunted - You wanna see life's meaning?. On the radio, Al Green, while Mom's cleanin'. Mom's singing along with the songs. And shortly I learned the words to 'em. Nerf balls, I threw 'em. But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus. Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic. I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle. Whose wife left him in the bottom. Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem. My liquid money's a hypnotist to your Mrs. Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist. Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is. Mystique like Sade. Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment. I ain't tryna do too much. Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough. But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle. I made it so I'm chillin' now. Transparent ceiling now. [Hook]. [Verse 3: Rick Ross]. The chorus cinematic, going back to Cali. Young street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's. Jewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler. I could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter. Domino effect, you in that magic city. Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli. Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly. Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city. Honor thou mother, go to war for my brother. Giving sufficient funds to significant others. Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature. More war came from the bottom so I know the war. Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm. Talking cash over salads, heavy cro√ªtons. Cuban Linx's equivalent to having suits on. Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on. [Hook]"
moment 4 life,"If I could take the time back, I would rewind back. The day my cousin asked my gran where his mom at. I want my aunt back and my dad too. They killed Shawty and Diddy that was sad too. I caught a couple homies off, shit I had to. Chained on me for the money, look what cash do. Thinking I'm rich, counting my money. Worrying bout mine, they should be counting it for me. I'm just adding up this paper subtracting my homies. Shawty be screaming how she love me. while bouncing it on me. She really don't like me, she just attracted to money. She chasing a benjy, saw that on the femy?. I'm just lowering my glock, hoping that it defend me. When them haters try to kill me I'm clapping the semi. She giving me head, I'm grabbing a remmy. I just want a B, like the back of the Bentley. Niggas say I'm Hollywood when I'm Hollyhood. Put my life on the line for them, shit I probably would. Switch that to probably woulda, I mean probably coulda. Put it on probably shoulda, but ain't nobody realer. Niggas is so fake, I did my Id check. Couple 100 with me, aint met nobody yet. I treat them like the beat, cuz ima body that. Moving throughout these streets. that's where you find me at. I ain't gonna lie, I saved my life. Dream got me running round, like it made my life. I ain't met a bitch yet, I would've made my wife. And I ain't met a nigga yet I would've made my right. Hand, damn, never take a stand. Never tell them boys information on your fam. Never tell them n-ggas information where you stand. Cuz they change like the weather. when you wait where you land. With that hammer in your face, answer for the cake. Ever seen one of your dogs transform into a snake. Ever seen one of those snakes transform into a rat. I be running through the jungle I could tell you bout that. I could tell you bout the drought. when the work got snapped. Whole hood started robbing, everybody got strapped. Whole team was just broke, everybody got back. I was selling sour diesel, everybody got crack. It's obvious I'm hot, it's obvious you cold. Presidential on my wrist, and it's obvious its gold. Whole hood got your statements it's obvious you told. Like a Lil Wayne album it's obvious you sold. I'm on some shit, running neck and neck with Vick. Trying to bring my city back. take us to where we never been. I'm just in the studio working like a Mexican. And they tell me I'm a rookie doing it like a veteran. Yea, big dreams small city. Trying to come up on me, but would you fall with me?. Would you clutch that hammer and bust it all with me?. Hundred miles an hour running from the law with me?. I ain't think so, I just blink slow. Million ways to get this money but we think snow. Every time I see a chick I just think hoe. And every time I meet a nigga I just think Po'. Moment 4 Life"

r.i.c.o (feat. drake),"[Intro: Drake]. Yeah, views, views, views. Yeah, yeah, alright. [Verse 1: Drake]. Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance. The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge. I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it. Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it. To the people that think that I owe you shit. Payback's a bitch and you know that shit. Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this. Please don't think nobody notices. I've been up for way too many days. Y'all sleep enough for me anyway. Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway. Y'all are not true to this anyway. Ovo, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R. I. C. O. Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal. I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people. They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws. But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam. They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans. And stay in your place fam. My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king. I should probably just move in to Graceland. Madonna? s a ting I know and I? m the king of pop. I? m building Never-Never Land. How he hate me when I never met the man. Woo! We might just get hit with the R. I. C. O. [Verse 2: Meek Mill]. Meek Milly!. Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles. I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (switch it up). Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle. For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here. I spend a day what you make a year. I had to drop this to make it clear. That I got it locked like Jamaican hair. All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence. Why we even got to take it here?. Why we even got to play these games?. Run up on me, catch a facial there. It's the Chasers, what you thought?. I come through my block like I'm Rico. Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal. I was like more a Rich Porter, no double crossing on my peoples. I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal. I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit. I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter. Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit. We came up from nothing. We started on list's most wanted but now its the Forbes list. We really was doing shit. I can hear echos from feds on this beat from informants. I think they recording. Shh, listen, you hear that?. [Outro: Drake]. We might just get hit with the R. I. C. O. We might just get hit with the R. I. C. O"

I'm like niggas ain't loyal, niggas ain't loyal. All these voices in my head sayin' niggas ain't for you. And when you get money these niggas aim for you. And when it's lookin' sunny these niggas rain on you. It's a dark cloud over me, money took control of me. I'm barely gettin' tired to sing my song unless you heard of me. Baby momma trippin' out. I tell her to work with me. I'm on probation still, stackers niggas wanna murder me. And lately I've been gettin' faded (faded). Got a couple armies out cuz them niggas hate me.

And then the dang bang chain. But the bezel on my runny and diamonds in my chain. Young rich nigga caught a millie worth of juice. Bad bitch with me tryna blow me like a fuse. Just to get a bag and maybe a pair of shoes. And he crazy with your lady if do for a pair of Louves. Big dreams turn to big things. I've been waitin' on this day since I was 16. In the kitchen with them things tryna make a killin'. We in the better now, ever mind I'm makin' millions. And these niggas talkin' rappers cuz they think I'm chillin'. 'Til I put some money on their head, yea make them feel it. How they on, honest dog like they never knew 'em. I have a merely walk upon when we run into 'em.

Young niggas gonna get it yeah. And then the dang bang chain. But the bezel on my runny and diamonds in my chain. The Meek shall inherit the earth. So Imma own this bitch until I'm buried in dirt. I only rode with niggas that would carry me to my hurse. Blesses for my grandma, she carry me to that church. And I don't know why, I just feel like I'm the one. They level me in fit but now look what I become. Or should I say cocaine? Mom I doin' it for the fame. I thought will they never make it but a winner gets the grain. Charges allyed in my name, says allegiance to my character. Life's a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her. Niggas gettin' murdered, this shit is gettin' scarier. Got in all the potholes, jumpin' all the perrier's. Bitch! I feel like I just got in that pussy. Said she wanna be a star, that's why she brought me that pussy. Tryna win, says she ain't the mux winner. That's why I take the time, just to play 'er much thinner. Cuz I'd never cold like not the winter. Not the weather, I'm talkin' about within us. You for that money? See as they kick a man and a friend. They get this man in the fight, I'm just like the pigeon. So every day that I wake up, my undivided attention. They go to get my cake up and stayin' out of them prisons. Yea, the system made me stronger. The bein' broke just gave me my hunger"
real,"I said I used to get high just to get by. Couldn't deal with my reality, was livin' in a lie. Sometimes I ask God ""is we livin' just to die?"". Conversations with my dad and he livin' in the sky. Thinkin' ""am I goin' crazy or is this shit for real?"". The spirit of a nigga who wills on its appeal. Fightin' to see the light and I'm fightin' to keep it real. Like a nigga with no lawyer I'm ready to take a deal. Got me feelin' like Cali cuz all I do is win. I don't practice no religion cuz all I do is sin. I don't even write it down, I'm just spittin' out what's in. I don't celebrate for victory and all I do is grin. Nah, shit I ain't braggin', I don't boast. But when it come to bread fuckin' slice I need a loaf. And a little bit of toast just to keep the haters on me. Man, I do this fo' my city, all the niggas waitin' on me. Look into my eyes, tell me what you see. A young'un full of pride with tendence of a G. I never gave a fuck what you heard about me. Never told, never sold soul, nigga this is me. Yea, I'm a family man. Don't you ever cross that line where my family stand. I said I'm goin' to come and get you in that family van. Coat shooters that let 'em have it like Yosemite Sam. I'm from a hood where these niggas scared to dream at. Fuck the money, they want nowhere to leam at. They make a lean back, I'm talkin' fade away. Mike Jordan, gettin' it ain't important. How can I forfeit? Niggas makin' a fortune. Livin' in fortresses, gettin' in on some Carter shit. Go out and go home and it's the orphanage. Same niggas that I grew up, I be often with. Smart circle cuz niggas will murk you. Most of the time it's niggas that know you. But my niggas is purple, hearted. I've seen a snake before they even started. Call 'em and now we daily the party. Look into my eyes, tell me what you see. A young'un full of pride with tendence of a G. I never gave a fuck what you heard about me. Never told, never sold soul, nigga this is me"

In the drop top with the Ac on. Stuntin' with Cash Money, get my Baby on. No, never fuck a chick that got Bakers on. Or no Michael Kors. I'm on the same shit that Mike was on. Jordan, Jackson, Tyson on. I've seen niggas your type twice before. I'm in that white velour, look at the flights I bought. These mothafuckin' hoes got a right to war. When a young real nigga light the floor. Hundred black bottles, man that's lights galore. Before Tom was Ford, I'm talkin' Honda Accord. Lookin' for a plug, tryna find the cord. Niggas gettin' shot tryna find the Lord. This bust down Rollie say the time is yours. I get my grindin' on. Like [?] in the [?] , it was mayday. Started with a warden, gun until I got an Ak. Kids in the projects when we was by the bay, bay. Kids with the Pyrex, I hit it first, Ray J. [Hook]. When the lights low, and the show starts. And the champagne spill on your bow tie. And your dawg change up, playin' both sides. No it won't stop, when the dope stop. When the fed rush in the dope spot. And your main man tell 'em how the coke drop. How he rain danced with me by the boat dock. I know when he did that, I bet that your ghost drop. I hope that you stand up. Young nigga just man up. I'm just hopin' you stand up.

Where I came from, where I came in. We eatin' lobster and steak from Top Ramen. Oodles and noodles, when you're hungry them killers'll do you. And when you're gettin' to that money them people pursue you. The Feds lurkin', the streets watchin'. Them hoes talkin', like ""he got it"". And he nervous, cause we plottin'. We call that boy for a burner and we rob him. Like Batman, pussy niggas gettin' backhand. Talkin' to the people you a at man. Half rack, we got more ghosts than Pac-Man. And for that paper we be grindin' like a lapdance. Get the money young nigga. Get the money, never fold, cause they comin' young nigga. When the feds get to rushin', better not tell on young nigga. Don't be selfish young nigga, just man up, don't give the fam up. Facin' 20 years when they added them grams up. Plus 5 more, he got booked with a handgun. And now he in the courtroom, givin' his mans up. Rat ass nigga. [Hook]. When the lights low, and the show starts. And the champagne spill on your bow tie. And your dawg change up, playin' both sides.

started from the bottom (freestyle),"Started from the bottom now we here. We were sellin' things, pullin' strings - puppeteer. Started with a dollar now I'm jumping out the Lear. All my niggas behind me, you can find me in the air. In the car smokin' loud on my way to Mr. Chow's. I say: ?ain't it funny now, nigga, this bracelet's fifty thou?. He say he gon' hit me, how? I keep shooters all around me. Quicker-picker-up your bitch, that pussy wet and I be Bounty. I got all these haters frontin' just from lookin' at my pictures. Plottin' on my Instagram, they wanna follow me like Twitter. On my way home?. But I'mma hit her, did I mention, 30 grand'll get you gone. You'll come up missing ?cause my cake long. Where your real friends at?. Hold up, fuck that, nigga, where your girlfriend at?. She probably in the VIP where all her girlfriends at. She know that you be hatin' on me and I still hit that, damn. You gon' need a green card for the Cuban link (ouch). Cancel my account, I'll probably move the bank. When you see them hammers out you'd best not move a blink. FN57, fuck around, shoot through a tank. Bitch, shake that ass, go on, shake them titties. Bitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City. I be bustin' bottles, ain't talkin' ?bout with Drizzy. Probably be with OVO and I be in Toronto city. With yo fake ass, and yo fake weed. Frontin' on a real nigga, bitch say cheese. And put your flash on just to catch the AP. Diamonds thunderin' all in that bitch, I call it KD. Hold up ? hold up, wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?. I popped twenty bottles, that was just a scrimmage. Nigga, you ain't ballin', you pop twenty and you finished. Got you fuckin' up your re-up every time we in the building. ?Cause we started from the bottom now we here. Sippin' Ros√© with Rozay and it's Belaire. I signed with MMG and did it in a year. I started with a circle and I turned it to a square, ya dig?"
stay woke (feat. miguel),"How I keep from goin' under?. It's like a jungle outside. Sometimes I wonder how I keep from goin' under. We scream, ""Black Lives Matter, "" but we still toting ladders. Watching our own brothers trying to get at us. Dreams get shattered when a scene full of crackers. And they charge you with some shit you ain't do. You like, ""what happened? "". We go get lawyers to say shit, we don't know how to talk. They told us to hate each other before we learn how to walk. Mama taught you how to fight, fight. before she taught you how to write, right. And daddy locked down in the cell, can't kiss you night, night. Monsters under the bed every night, feel like it's fright night. Coke fumes in the air, mama holding on that pipe tight. And you catchin' contact, but never mind that. In a world where Black is wrong and white right. it's like a combat. We go to war for our freedom, they say we equal. I used to wanna play like Randall and be an Eagle. I used to play the quarterback, my dog would go receiver. That was 'til the ball got flat by a dope needle on the pavement. It's amazin', this environment we was raised in. On them papers, one mistake and I'm gettin' caged in. You gotta feel me, feel like the system tryna kill me. Got arrested and the charges F1. for popping wheelies, stay woke. It was designed for us to fail. We still prevail through the hell. Yeah, can you believe it? We're still undefeated. Though it was designed for us to lose. We'll still make it through, nothing's impossible. Can you beleive it? We're still undefeated. Picture me ten years younger with some tats on my face. Takin' a bunch of Xannys with the strap on my waist. Pointin' it at the camera like mama ain't teach me manners. Tryna see mo' bills like I'm headed to Alabama, no, wait. I can't judge them, I'm just trying to understand them. Cause I used to pop Percs, pourin' purple in my Fanta. Had me swerving in my Phantom. like I'm runnin' from my dreams. I was headed for the slammer, I was plantin' all the seed. For them to bury me, I had my whole family mad at me. Fell deep in love with the game and it married me. Judge said, ""I'll give you a chance, just don't embarrass me"". Motivatin' these little niggas is like a charity. Community service even though they knew we was workin'. They did this to me on purpose. 'cause I ain't movin' too perfect. I stay away from them clowns. watch how I move through the circus. 'Cause they be weighing you down. even some of them dudes in your circle, stay woke. Though it's designed for us to fail, yeah. We still prevail through the hell, yeah. Can you believe it? We're still undefeated. Though it was designed for us to lose. Nothing, nothing, nothing's impossible, no. Can you beleive it? We're still undefeated. How can I pledge allegiance to the flag. When they killin' all our sons, all our dads?. I come from a place, when you kill your own brother. you can brag. Like he got bodies, but that's a fad, no, that's a fact. I'm screamin' out at your corner, nigga, that's a trap. Screamin' out at your homie, nigga, that's a rat. Catch a case with him, bet he crack. The odds against you and they double stacked, stay woke. Bought my mom a new crib, that's some gangster shit. Niece and nephews walking around wearing minks and shit. Kept the hood motivated, this the thanks I get. Try to Ja Rule the kid on some Wanksta shit. But that's impossible 'cause I'm unstoppable. The label can't drop me, nigga, I'm too valuable. You thought I would lose but I won and that bothered you. Still movin' 'round in Philly just like the mobsters do. When I talked to Em and Hov, they said, ""I'm proud of you. You stood tall back when everyone doubted you"". My reply is, ""I did what I gotta do. And I need that verse 'fore you retire too"". Jumping all the obstacles, I'm way too wavy. Said I would lose boy you way too crazy. Pick and choose either fame or the money. fame will make you crazy. And the money will make them bad bitches say. ""Thank you, baby"". You're welcome"

the end,"Okay, these niggas wanna be sleek. It's nine in the morning. I ain't been asleep yet. I though sleep was for billionaires. I think I'm the last of the street niggas left. Uh. When it come to stuntin', I'm like money man Meech. Brought my city with me and we coming in the fleet. And now I'm getting richer. and they don't want me in the streets. I'm thinking fuck a album sales. we sold a hundred bricks this week. Thousand grams of crack, take it to the table. Bag it all up, take it to the label and tell 'em distribute it. I'm getting cake ridiculous. Rari like a frog, coming through the track, whippin' it. And they tellin' me to turn down. they say that I need riddling. Ballin' like I'm Jordan, no assists from Sottie Pippen. And it ain't enough flows, crossing over like I'm dribling. Running laps round them rappers, tired like Michelin. Started off with Tip and 'em but that wasn't it for him. Yellow, blow Cuban, diamonds blue like Michigan. Been taught you niggas. That there's levels and there's differences. See this lifestyle, the way a real nigga livin' it. I'm gettin' it, nigga put yourself in my predicament. If you was gettin' all of this fucking money. You won't spend this shit. I be at the dealership, pointing out and picking shit. Just to shake the town up, talking off the whip and shit. Take 'em to the clear port, no Instagram, picture it. Niggas taking pictures for the Instagram, twinning shit. On the jet, fifty for the flight to go to Liv and shit. Spend another thirty on the champ. And never sipped the shit. One million, two million, three million, four. I can have a million dollars knocking at my door. Ridin' in the passenger, like 2pac Shakur. Only thing that's different is this new Glock that roar. Get rocks from the paper, a rush from the money. If money talk it's like you said hush to your money. These broke niggas say I talk too much about the money. That's what we do it for the love of the money. Nigga. We're sitting here. I'm supposed to be the franchise player. And we're in here talking about practice. Not the game that I go out there and die for. And play every game like it's my last. Not the game. We talking about practice man. I mean how silly is that?. We talking about practice. What are we talkin' about?. Practice? We talking about practice man. We talking about practice. We talking about practice. We ain't talking 'bout the game. We talking about practice, man"
the get back (freestyle),"The money turned me into a monster. The money turned my noodles into pasta. The money turned my tuna into lobster. They want to do me I'mma do it like a mobster. 4 A. M. I'm on the north side of Philly. Riding around like these haters don't want to kill me. It's a shame how they hate on me you gotta feel me. I started out with a dollar and got a milli. I'm like do it for the gram ho, do it for the gram ho. She don't want to bust it I say do it for them bands yo. I say do it for them bands fucking with that broke. Nigga you should do it for your man. Lately I've been on the low with a ho. that you probably know. Took her to the crib and met momma right at the door. Momma started smiling like momma I got to go. I done took so many trophies that my momma [?]. I said a real nigga, I get that money pay them bills nigga. My momma told me ""you a real nigga"". And I be hanging with them real killers. Now what a feeling when you looking. At the latest whipping knowing you can cop it. Or looking at the baddest bitch. and knowing you could pop it. The youngest nigga in my city doing it I got it. On another level with Benjamin. and money is the topic lord. I put my jeweler on his feet. Hundred thou I used to do that every week. Never sleep its funny how I never speak. You see a foreign in my city that was me. That was us, never sweet. We went to war niggas riding down the street. Popping that pistol they talking they never did. Dropping the nickel with something that never cease. I've been sitting on that money like a chair. I've been getting to that money all year. All year and my niggas all here. But we started from the bottom. we was selling hard squares. Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain I'm ready. Switching lanes in that Mulsanne like I'm Andretti. I do the Balmain, Balenciaga, no Giuseppe. If they sleep on Meek Milly. I kill these niggas like I was Freddy. I eat that pussy like a monster. She gon' ride this dick she gon' need a sponsor. You could tell I'm philly from my posture. And we be whipping coca like its pasta. I be on money, 2 milly 4 milly no I need more money. I get that ""see a bad bitch. and be like how you doing"" money. They like how you doing honey oh"
the ride,"See what I do just like this?. I do it for the young'un and the ghetto. The train will never hear his story. cuz he ain't gonna make it to tell it. So you know it's crazy. I went to court the other day, the D.A. say she hate me. How you gonna hate me when me and Lou just took. 20 racks and put clothes on them kids backs?. It's 30 degrees outside. 24, how could I ask for more?. I got my deals, gettin' real, I'm makin' cash fo' sure. Strikin' every chance I get because I had it poor. But every time I go to sleep I hear the devil at my door. And I'm on them paper so them cars are goin' back and forth. Get off with probation, they all said I'd come back for sure. Minds is turned to zombies from that raw. because it's crack the law. You wonder why them babies runnin' crazy 'stead of clappin' off. Gettin' life before they get pussy. Cuz ain't nobody love 'em so they lives they took in. Locked in cages, having fighting over cookies. And much strange, is happy them days ain't never killed 'em. Yea I remember, it was a hot December. Niggas die on top of winter cuz them kids need them toys. Well Santa Claus don't see them boys. Them see the girls around here, there's Jack boys down stairs. No man with the big bag just man with the big gap. Try and take your shit back cuz he feel the world owe 'im. And his daughter want a. Barbie bike for Christmas, he gon show up. That the love is there, no mother there. Just her little brother there. We wash our pain with. Belvedere and use the drugs they brought us here. We get high to get by. Hotdogs more rib buys with tears drip from red eyes. Is what ends don't meet the damn lies. The D.A. said she hate me but I don't understand. When I just rock the show in front of 50.000 fans. I think that girl's racist, she probly in a clash. She take her pain out on me but she probly need a man. I took my mind from public housin', put it in the Styx. I came a long way from welfare and get with it. That shit just made me hungry. And now we gettin' rich and all these niggas gettin' sick. I know they wanna get me here cuz of Bobby. Yea, cuz of Bobby. It's like sometimes. I always gotta let these type of dreams go man,. just speakin' to the streets. And bitch said she hate me. I fuck some time away about that. Last night we just came out giving. 2-300 pair of shoes to the schools. To the boys' and the girls' basketball teams. How you hate me?. You hate me cuz. I'm goin' out supposedly doin' a lot of god damn money and. I got more money than you?. Well, bitch you can hate me for that. Let's get it"
the trillest,"[Hook: Meek Mill]. Was the money good? Was em bitches bad?. Was them fuckin' good?. Did your hood show you love? did the hoes say you fly?. If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky. For the trillest, for the trillest. As the champagne pours and the campaign roars. And the lights shine bright every night that plug. for the trillest. [Verse 1: Meek Mill]. See my momma cry too many tears. And we been broke like too many years. It ain't too many kids, a couple homies. there ain't too many there. And they all gotta eat, they got too many kids. To many kids with no fathers, doing too many bids. Too many bids, just gave 'em kids too many years. As soon as you get that money, that's sooner they appear. Some [?] as soon as you share. And yeah, I've been losin' touch with my family. it ain't the same. I should've gave my sister some money, but I made it rain. I should've hit the crib with my son and play a game. But instead I ended up at the jeweler to make a chain. It's saying saying when you make money. it make you change. Like four quarters, the fourth quarter, I made a lane. Shit, I had to walk forward they talkin' 'bout takin' trains. And takin' planes, I put the work in and made a name. But the question is. [Hook: Meek Mill]. Was the money good? Was them bitches bad?. was they fuckin' good?. Did your hood show you love? did the hoes say you fly?. If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky. For the trillest, for the trillest. As the champagne pours and the campaign roars. And the lights shine bright. every night that plug, for the trillest. [Verse 2: Meek Mill]. I never wanted to be like Mike, I wanted to be like Mitch. Now all the lil' niggas wanna be like this. I wear my chain in any city, let you see my shit. Cause I earned that, it's on me, I'mma keep that shit. I got blood on my money, ether in my soul. Do you know the feeling durin' Easter with no clothes?. Now it's stars in the ceiling, bringing ether out the rose. With the curtains on the windows. I'm just peepin' at my ghost. Money made me iller, already was realer. Young kings killin', young kings over skrilla. That's why I ride around mac on me like I was Miller. Or Reggie when I shoot for that three. They drop fetty, that's good money. Come to my city, we talk heavy and die young. When we get some paper, we cop Prezis [?]. 20 inch rims for the dope boy. Sellin' that coke boy, trappin' on your note boy. Got that [?] off money, fuck I need a note for!. In them school hallways like ""fuck I need a note for! "". We ain't wanna go to class, was sellin' coke raw. The principal was coppa too, hit him with a snowball. [Hook: Meek Mill]. Was the money good? Was them bitches bad?. was they fuckin' good?. Did your hood show you love? did the hoes say you fly?. If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky. For the trillest, for the trillest. As the champagne pours and the campaign roars. And the lights shine bright every night that plug. for the trillest. [Verse 3: Meek Mill]. Lookin' for that intro I was at the dealer. lookin' for another Benzo. Match kicks with my Kenzo, young nigga. Heart of a lion, hungry as hippo. When I was on my last, nobody ain't tell me shit though. Flow slicker than Crisco, niggas talkin', I get low. Do my thing, they jump back, know how that shit go. And they still say I'm arrogant. I'm still eatin' steak with the asparagus. When I get that money like I married it. 1 milly, 2 milly, 3 milly, buried it. Since they say I'm underground, I run that bitch like Harriet. Rolls Royce pushin' real slow like a chariot. Pull up on 'em niggas that got to me, shit, embarrassin'. I'mma real nigga with money, never trash it. You a fake niggas with money, it's no comparison. Told me that I couldn't get signed when I was rappin' it. And told me I couldn't do songs when I was battlin'. They told me that I couldn't be trap, I started trappin' it. Never listen to 'em, oh well, shit is Immaculate. I'mma just go sit up in this back again. Smoke the weed and laugh at 'em. Make a couple million by accident. Couple niggas dropped on Twitter say they back again. Couple months later on Twitter they say us laxative. Shitted on 'em Nicky voice, did it on 'em Benjamins. Plently of 'em Benjamins, semi on 'em a many on a. Whole 'nother level from before now. Tell my niggas when I see a hundred mil its going down. When I made my first mil, I was like ""it's on now"". Then I made my second mil, money on the floor now. Then I made my third mil, I'm like ""I need more now? "". I got in my zone and that money started pourin' down. Every time I hit the booth, microphone torn down. We couldn't get a pair of Pumas. we up in the store now, bitches!"
trauma,"(Used to be a dreamer). (But you know I've found...). Uh, my mama used to pray that she'd see me in Yale. It's fucked up she gotta see me in jail. On the visit with Lil' Papi, it hurt. Even though I seen her be well. They got a smoker with a key to my cell, damn. And even worse, my dad black, don't wanna see me do well. It's either that or black people for sale. Gave me 2 to 4 years like, ""Fuck your life"". Meet me in hell and let it burn like Lucifer. You look even stupider tryin' to impress them people in power with power abusin' us. For 44 dollars a hour, you coward, they're using you. Was it self-hate that made you send me upstate?. This where the so-called ""Real niggas"" sweeping up for cupcakes. And that's your phone time. If you ain't got no money, you ain't online. Hey call your son, call your daughter just to wish them all prime. Oh God, don't let them streets get a hold of them. Your daughter fuckin' now, it's gon be a cold summer. Your son trappin' and your homie givin' O's to him. And if he fuck that paper up, he puttin' holes through him. And you just wanna make it home, so you can show it to him. And them people ain't finna give no parole to you. They want blood. We all hangin' with a noose on our neck. My celly mom just died, he wanna use my collect. And he won't make it to the wake unless he give 'em a check. We still niggas though, what you expect?. I just want. I was on the corner with the wreath. Man, they got us warrin' for our freedom. See my brother blood on the pavement. How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?. Huh, trauma. When them drugs got a hold of your mamma. And the drugs got a hold on your father. Go to school, bullet holes in the walls. Ain't no PTSD's, them drugs keep it at ease. They shot that boy twenty times when they coulda told him just freeze. Coulda put him in a cop car, but they let him just bleed. ""The ambulance, it comin' baby, just breathe"". That's what the old lady said when she screamed. It's Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th. And in the 13th Amendment, it don't say that we kings. It say we legally slaves if we go to the pen. They told Kaep ""Stand up, you wanna play for a team"". And all his teammates ain't saying a thing (Stay woke). If you don't stand for nothin', you gon' fall for somethin'. And in the 60's, if you kneeled, you'd probably be killed. But they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal. Kill your account, liquid money gets spilled (Check it). And they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal. Kill your account, liquid money gets spilled. I just want. I was on the corner with the wreath. Man, they got us warrin' for our freedom. See my brother blood on the pavement. How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?. Huh, trauma. When them drugs got a hold of your mamma. And the drugs got a hold on your father. Go to school, bullet holes in the walls. How many times you send me to jail to know that I won't fail?. Invisible shackles on the king, 'cause shit, I'm on bail. I went from selling out arenas, now shit, I'm on sale. Them cold nights startin' to feel like hell, uhh. Watching a black woman take my freedom. Almost made me hate my people. When they label you felon, it's like they tellin' you they not equal. 11 years goin' to court knowin' they might keep you will drive you crazy. 23 hours in a cell, somebody save me. I'm on a jail car, tryna explain it to my baby. I gotta do the calendar twice, and that's a maybe. Trauma. I just want. I was on the corner with the wreath. Man, they got us warrin' for our freedom. See my brother blood on the pavement. How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?. Huh, trauma. When them drugs got a hold of your mamma. And the drugs got a hold on your father. Go to school, bullet holes in the walls"
traumatized,"It really hurt me when they killed Shotty. I was locked down in my cell and I had to read about it. And when they killed Diddy, left him out in Philly. We was young and gettin' money. man we used to run the city. We was rockin' all them shows, fuckin' all them hoes. And when they killed Darryl. Renee had to see him froze on the ground. Downtown, I can hear the sounds now. When she walked up to that casket. seen her son and fell down. I drop tears for my niggas that ain't here. And still think about you even though that it been years. Cause half the niggas that I grew up with is all dead. All this pain and all this stressin'. I should have a bald head. Cause when my Aunt Rhonda died. she looked Tock in his eyes. Saw death comin', when she seen it she just cried. Prolly part of the reason we drink and we get high. When I find the nigga that killed my daddy. know I'mma ride. Hope you hear me, I'mma kill you nigga. To let you know that I don't feel you nigga. Yeah, you ripped my family apart. and made my momma cry. So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide. Cuz I was only a toddler, you left me traumatized. You made me man of the house and it was grindin' time. So I'mma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you. And for all them cloudy days. I'mma let this rain hit you nigga. You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry. So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide. I know. So I'mma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you. And for all them cloudy days. I'mma let this rain hit you nigga. And I ain't ready. Niggas wanna murder me I'm ridin' around heavy. I think they wanna wet me like New Orleans. and the levees. But I got this mac elevy, these niggas'll never get me. Lord knows, I got alotta homies in the dirt. Niggas sprayin' metal tryna take you off the earth. Really over nothin', tell me what it's worth. Tryna take you out the game just to put you on a shirt. I Rose from the jungle like Derrick. Death to anybody that oppose my spirit. My future lookin' brighter than this rose I'm starin' at. We be runnin' trains on the hoes y'all cherish. Rest in peace to my niggas, I swear I miss them to death. My hammer sing murda music, I'll let you listen to death. I'll have you walk with the reaper. when hollows rip through your chest. Cause if you throw 'em I throw back like Mitchell & Ness. I'm gone. I know. You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry. So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide. I know. So I'mma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you. And for all them cloudy days. I'mma let this rain hit you nigga. Man my life so real. Last night I went to sleep and woke up with the chills. Started with a dollar now I got a couple mil. And I make a hundred thousand every time a nigga spill. Man I almost got murked in front of the same church. My dad got carried in, family got married in. That was in my older days, this is now, that was then. Had the block jumpin' for them dollars, Shawn Marion. Young nigga gon' get my own that's why I'm arrogant. Homie need the bail, for them bonds we'll bury 'em. Lock 'em like a terrier. Breakin' all barriers. Just to beat the trial we go miles like Darius. Cause cops tryna catch me, niggas tryna clap me. Haters runnin at me, know they wanna get at me. And people got the nerve to ask why I don't look happy. I did it for my niggas, and I did this shit for Kathy. I know. You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry. So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide. I know. So I'mma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you. And for all them cloudy days. I'mma let this rain hit you nigga"
triumphant (get 'em),"Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em. Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em. Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em. Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em. Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em. Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em. They told me get 'em, I got 'em,. I swear this word to my father. And the only way to make it to the top. If you go and get it from the bottom. And I ain't never asked for no hand outs. You won't carry me, no Mariah. These haters love when I was dead broke. But they ain't mad at me,. I'm on fire and I'm gon' burn. And I ain't gon' learn,. I remember they said that it ain't my turn. But it ain't confirmed, then the tables turned. Just look at me now, try to hold me down. But I ain't gon' stop, cause I'm gon' climb. To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let's go. Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living. Stay on your toes. Get off the ropes. Don't let 'em ever count you out. Realize all things are possible. In your heart who's the greatest. Reach for the stars. Be all that you are. And make 'em all fall down. Path that I choose flashing camera's as I pose. Throwing big money as she dances on the pole. Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road. License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls. Born slick talker, twice a week shopper. Blow a hundred wreck she don't know a footlocker. Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore. With a blonde bombshell tryin to bomb with your boy. In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater. Smoking like pimp c, spoken like a trill ni**a. On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain. Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day. Came from humble beginnings. Then was Hummers and Benzes. Now it's hundred and millions this is only the beginning. A don, a diva, the bomb achiever. The one believer, the game gets deeper. Can't fall down stay triumphant keep on living. Stay on your toes. Get off the ropes. Don't let 'em ever count you out. Realize all things are possible. In your heart who's the greatest. Reach for the stars. Be all that you are. And make 'em all fall down. They told me get 'em, I got 'em,. Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em. They told me get 'em, I got 'em,. Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em. They told me get 'em, I got 'em,. Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em. They told me get 'em, I got 'em,. Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em. Can't fall down now, so even when clouds surround you. And everyone seems to doubt you. Baby still know who you are. So you gotta keep on climbing. In spite of the chains that bind you. You can see the mountain top. It's not too far. Stay triumphant keep on living. Stay on your toes. Get off the rope. Don't let 'em ever count you out. Realize all things are possible. In your heart who's the greatest. Reach for the stars. Be all that you are. And make 'em all fall down. Can't fall down stay triumphant keep on living. Stay on your toes, get off the ropes. Don't let 'em ever count you out. Realize all things are possible. In your heart who's the greatest. Reach for the stars. Be all that you are. And make 'em all fall down. They told me get 'em, I got 'em..."
used to be (feat. jordanne),"[Chorus]. I used to be, I used to. (Used to used to used to). I used to be, I used to. (I used to be, I used to). I used to grind in the dirt. I used to cry 'til it hurt. I will make love to the headphones. When is my time gonna come?. I used to be, I used to. But I never got used to. Bein' what I used to be. So I used to be, I used to (yea). But I never got used to (neva'). Bein' what I used to be. I was never used to niggas that was used to. Bein' broke so I started sellin' coke. Times got hard with sellin' soap. Skimmin' just like the preacher I church, you sellin' hope. Now I'm gettin' older, heart gettin' colder. Lookin' at my son wife's head laid on my shoulder. Thinkin' in my head ""will I make it to see him grow up?"". Or will I catch a bullet from some these niggas throwin'?. Try and take me out? In the hood try and make it out. Niggas flightin' on me, cops all stakin' out. Try and get a couple bricks so I could make a house. Close friends hatin' on me, really try and play me out. Damn, the niggas couldn't deal with me. If they had Blackjack my shooters would still hit it. No sight of Philly where is real greedy, and dirty at. We're right we're they're murdered at. I used to be, I used to. (Used to used to used to). I used to be, I used to. (I used to be, I used to). I used to grind in the dirt. I used to cry 'til it hurt. I will make love to the headphones. When is my time gonna come?. I used to be, I used to. But I never got used to. Bein' what I used to be. So I used to be, I used to. But I never got used to. Bein' what I used to be. When I was young I started planning it out. My daddy got killed, I was the man of the house. By the age of 16, then them Hamill's was out. So a nigga's tryin' to hit me, I'm just handin' him out. Cuz I ain't tryna see my mom cryin' and my sis' mornin'. So Imma let this little Mackie level rip on 'im. Loubrutton sneaks, watch the blood drip on 'em. For all the times I bled, the tears I shed. Every time I made money, it was here I set. And if my niggas ask for it was ""yea"" I said. Sellin' butter just to get the fam bread. I swear I got mad to the streets and it was here I went. Cuz I was never used to bein' what I used to. Started all walkin' down the roads, where's the coop to?. Imma let the top down every time I shoot through. To give a motivation even though I know they hate her. I used to be, I used to. (Used to used to used to). I used to be, I used to. (I used to be, I used to). I used to grind in the dirt. I used to cry 'til it hurt. I will make love to the headphones. When is my time gonna come?. I used to be, I used to. But I never got used to. Bein' what I used to be. So I used to be, I used to. But I never got used to. Bein' what I used to be. The man with the gold makes the rules. Anyone who makes the rules, break the rules. Some niggas make it alive, some make the news. It's either family or money, I hate to choose. Cuz you need money just to feed the fam. And family keep you cool. Got nigga on the paper, still I keep the tube. Niggas heard him gettin' money so they creepin' through. I get my hand up on that hammer, what's for me to do?. Let these niggas kill me?. Try to line me up so they can reel me?. I'm just givin' you the real me. Started with a dollar, now I got and I'm filthy. Nigga!. I used to be, I used to. (Used to used to used to). I used to be, I used to. (I used to be, I used to). I used to grind in the dirt. I used to cry 'til it hurt. I will make love to the headphones. When is my time gonna come?. I used to be, I used to. But I never got used to. Bein' what I used to be. So I used to be, I used to. But I never got used to. Bein' what I used to be"
