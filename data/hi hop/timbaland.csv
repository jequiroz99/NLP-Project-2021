I'm spittin the version of verses curses over the churches. Rappin mo' iller than thriller manila and give you salmonella. [timbaland]. Stop, the press!.

C'mon baby what's the hold up. You carryin me like your school folder. I want your dinner, not your cold cuts. Why you keep givin me the cold shoulder?. (Shorty). C'mon baby what's the hold up. You carryin me like your school folder. I want your dinner, not your cold cuts. Why you keep givin me the cold shoulder?. (Cause I'm that fly). [Verse 1 - Magoo]. When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall. And I think of them times when you was lickin my balls. I never came in your face, you said you hated the taste. That's a disgrace, I'd rather put my cum inside your weight plate. You comfortable now? You need your toes massaged. I'm oblaged to rub 'em down, first I put on da barges. With your favorite song, you need to take off the thong. Go head, nibble on my neck, your doin it wrong. We could be doin it, and doin it, and doin it wild. I wanna lick on you and lick on you, I like when you smile. I'll be in town next week, can I keep an erection?. Twelve pack of Lifestyles is my choice of protection. See I'm more than pimperific, let me be more specific. On a scale of one to ten, my sex is so terrific. It's like I'm Rick James ""Superfreaky"" things. I put a hot dog in your bum that sure to make you cum. [Chorus]. [Verse 2 - Timbaland]. Uh, it was a teenage love, a, a, a teenage love. And I told her, don't hurt me again. Actin like the vaughn a vo in my living room den. Like it never took much to really get you back then. Just some college ruled paper and my ball point pen. Crackers, pimp juice, and my cranberry Benz. We circle my block and we do it again. Now let's fast forward to my living room flo'. Where we was freakin and she speakin gettin about to go. I slap broke my watch cause this raggedy ho. She like the time wasn't right, then she hugged me slow. Uh, it was a teenage love, a, a, a teenage love. And I told her, don't hurt me again. Can't we live like The Ropers, ""Three's Company"" man, huh?. [Chorus]. [Verse 3 - Magoo]. Tell me if she like it and if not. Girl is this your spot?. I never cum in second, some reppin for camel lot. And when I was a kid, I used to fuck in the bushes. Only time I turn it down is when you don't use dush. You got the ""Eye of a Tiger"" and your pussy is fly. It's a Hall of Fame booty baby, gonna retire. And I aspire to be penis of convenience for you. But we fuckin in the bed, let's cut in the living room. You likin my pimperation, do I calm your frustration?. Never bein pleased, so you settle with masturbation. I got a 'C' on my chest cause I'm super when cuttin. Give me fifteen minutes, guarantee you'll be comin and cummin. [Chorus]"

Tim took you from ghetto to class, how to hold your glass. To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash. People was seein' you pass, like right through the drapes. I brought you the private, ounce wit the gates. Thinkin' that stuff make me faint, just whistle real fast. Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag. Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for. It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour. And I'm deeply committed, although I'm forgettin'. Sometimes while hittin' it ,different names would slip. If I been wit a chick, check me miss. Your complexion switched, honey you been on trips. But you don't appreciate this, till your back in the Jetta. No iceberg you own, just Angelica's sweaters. If the steaks ain't T-Bone, you ain't properly fed.

[Verse 1: Timbaland]. It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you. Without some little nieces and nephews. To cover all the beats, and the rhymes I been through. Time's up, sorry I left you. Thinking of this, I keep repeating them hits. Like that Aaliyah, Timberlake, or Missy Elliott shit (Shit). As you sit by the radio, hands on the dial tone. As you hear it, pump up the volume. Jump when you hear them speakers left it off (Off). Mr. VA 'bout to set it off. Well I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what ya know. Well my folks don' told me, (YOU GOT IT! Oh). So, ""Up Jumps the Boogie"", let the record work (Uh huh). And put me on like you red alert. 'Cause it's the big bad Timmy, Maganoo, and Missy.

Let them pretend to be me, then they know. I hate when one, pretend to fantasize. Fact I despise, those who even try. Sweat between my thighs {*sniff*} never stinking.

If I wasn't writing rhymes I'd be breaking in homes. I'm kinda young, so my gun's my security. I'm not afraid nucca do what you gon do to me. I get paid when your record is played. To put it short, heh I got it made. I'm talented, yes I'm gifted. My uppercut boy that'll get ya lifted. You got cash? man stop frontin. Living off damn every record that you cutting.

As the lucky lady night lost in the crowd. I said you did you when the lights go down wow. Too late to stop girl you know what to do. Baby don't waste my time, hurry up. Don't wait no more.

crazy girl,"[Timbaland]. Hey Baby, Chill out, chill out, chill out. Hey baby, chill out, chill out, chill out. Girl in chain, woke up in the morning. And already knowing ain't no telling what you might do. When I am gone, you give me that crazy town. And you want to know why I want to get so far away. from you. I guess it's safe to say the the thrill is gone,. You think you know but it is not true. It would be best if I left you alone,. I think your head is missing something to wishes come true. Used to think I want that, I want that. But now I am saying I want that, want that. And all the time I want that, I want that. So baby I am going to ball back and tell you, tell. you. [Chorus - Justin Timberlake]. I have seen a lot of things but I have never seen. hey!. I never seen a girl as crazy as you. Seen alot of crazy places and crazy faces. But never seen a girl as crazy as you. Now your style must have lost your mind. Wish I could press you a while. And figure out what did I do. I have seen a lot of things but. I haven't seen, hey!. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you. [Timbaland]. Hey baby you got going here. You could drive those places up my dear. We both know your head ain't right. I wake up and you're standing over me while I sleep at night. Now tell me what you are going to tell our friends. When I change those locks and you can't get in. And it when it talks while I sing this song,. And I don't need a doc to tell me you're gone. And happens every time every thing you say you lie. Every time I try. I don't need it no more. You on the other side. You so schizophrenic and. Just made me realize that. I need to tell ya ya. [Justin]. I have seen a lot of things but I have never seen. hey!. I never seen a girl as crazy as you. Seen alot of crazy places and crazy faces. But never seen a girl as crazy as you. Now your style must have lost your mind. Wish I could press you a while. And figure out what did I do. I have seen a lot of things but. I haven't seen, hey!. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you. [Justin]. Shit she took the key to the drivers side door of my car. Just because she said she had a dream that she saw me with some other broad. Now I am standing on the front lawn and gun and my. hand shaking how did I get this far. But I know who you really are, and I have never seen a girl as crazy as you. [Justin]. I have seen a lot of things but I have never seen. hey!. I never seen a girl as crazy as you. Seen alot of crazy places and crazy faces. But never seen a girl as crazy as you. Now your style must have lost your mind. Wish I could press you a while. And figure out what did I do. I have seen a lot of things but. I haven't seen, hey!. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you, as you, as you. I never has seen a girl as crazy as you"
da funk,"[Verse 1]. Uh Check out the flava. I got you strung out like Kayta. Catch me on ???. Just can not fate her. Later for all you whack MC's. Claim to be my friend. But really my enemy (me me me). Why you want to mess with me. Cus I got Mentalor. I'll mess you up like that lady in Mallas. Thats childish. Cus I'm on another level. Uh universal-cology on the f-in-devel. Uh bring the shovel. Cus I'm bout to dig your grave. Not a lady but I call Mad Rage. On stage. Stick of you like ..... Dan Cage. Cus I'm doin this my way. [Chorus]. I dont know. You been told. About that funk. Bass control. Dat Funk baby dat funk. Dat Funk baby dat funk. [repeat]. [Verse 2]. Magoo whats up my nigga. Do you want this girl with this fine figure. Get with her. After that then we trick her. Then get her drunk off the Thunderbird Liquor. Then video tape her like that man did on Slipper. If she acts up dismiss her (what what what). I hope she don't think we acting hard. Cus we in with the mayor and that big boy Sarge. Ain't that large. They will say it will be that. With Timberland and that Maganoo sound now. You must go through initiation. Bad situation. Like a brother on a plantation. Time is wasting. Catch me on location. on your funky radio station. Da Funk Da Funk. [repeating funk through the chorus]. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. 1,2 1,2 where ya gonna run to. When I come through when you start acting brand new. I'm like a maniac when I do my track. I doubt it if my beats will be whack. Play like Sylvester and leave me Stallone. Cus I'm gonna find your girl and make her moan (what). Make her get on and on (on and on on on on and on). Now I got this far. I'm a smooth black brother so I paid off the star. Hot now I'm gone with the quickness. It's a damn shame I am so relentless. I'm the crazy thriller. I slap the F off Farina and then took his Miller. I like (I like). Cus I'm right. Old tight (wont tight). Riight. [Chorus almost to the end]. ""Da Funk"" [is repeated till the end]"
deep in your memory,"Timbaland]. Whas happenin dude?. Whatchu thinkin about there?. What's goin on? Talk to me. I know you're thinkin. What? Must be a lot on your mind. Express yourself fool. Tell me what you thinkin about, nigga. [Magoo]. Who why whatever, any puzzle I put it together. With any stress I'm copin like a flesh wound I'm open. Still got balls after vasectomies. My anatomy is strictly scientifical your life is pitiful. I got no relationships, just hit and then dismiss. My sex is strictly fuck, no man, I do not kiss. Keep my shirt on, I'm quick to dress back up. I'm chargin girls for dick, my dick you stick up. Butt naked, like Adam and Eve on Christmas Eve. Who is God? White the Devil, do you believe?. Scratch your head and think about it for a minute. Is my life a dream and y'all playin parts in it?. You talkin like you drunken, but you flunkin. Classes you be takin, let me bring home the bacon. We been hoodwinked, bamboozled. Led astray, til all our business on rent in late. Somewhere in your mind. And real deep in your memory. You try to hide away. Your true feelings. (repeat 2X). Am I underrated? Thinkin bout it get me frustrated. I'm elated, that keep it real is outdated. Graduated, from PG now I'm X-Rated. Glad I made it, left you behind, and you hate it. Look into my eyes, do you see a nigga or a person. See I worsen, section eight got to be flirtin. Fuck workin, for eighty-five who you jivin?. Still survivin, lock your fuckin door when I'm arrivin. Surprisin realizin magnetisin. This rhyme bend how I'm risin, hypnotizin. Got comments, put replies in. No lies in, if you do your life will need revivin. When I'm sleep I die, when I wake up I'm born. I leave the Earth each day to get my soul reborn. So to God I pray, I make it through this day. This must be Deja Vu, cause I relive this day. Somewhere in your mind. And real deep in your memory. You try to hide away. Your true feelings. (repeat 2X). [Timbaland]. Bring it on it, freak it on it. [Magoo]. Child abused, as a child. Child Magoo, buck-wild. Wel-fare, met the cake. Too much sugar, in the Kool-Aid. Mis-fit, un-til. I fucked Jiil, on the hill. Look, out, heads, up. To the girls, let's buck. Like, night-shade, grows. Workin dope, mind, flows. But, please, I'm on hot. I cook, non-stop. Stick a pin, in some paper. Take notes, play ya later. Praise, God, he, made ya. No, man, but, praiser. Somewhere in your mind. When you think deep in your memory. You try to hide away. Your true feelings. (repeat 2X)"
don't make me take it there,"[Timbaland]. Yau [echo 2x Yau]. They still won't give me my props. Now I'm pissed off. Y'all will see the other side of me. Come on. Like this. I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be. If a nigga didn't make his entry. Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats. Waiting on my arrivlary. Y'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me. Instead of always comparin' me. If I hear one more remark about me. I guess I gotta ride on my enemies. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho - What I will nigga. What the fuck would the music be, if it wasn't for Timothy. When the game is feverish, then I create the remedies. And crumble leads until I'm buzz and I'm laxed. And them hoes show me love in every club that I'm at. For every hood got' get back, what another nigga envy. But I swear I ain't no killer, but y'all niggaz 'bout to tempt me. To the point there the barrels empty until you gon' recent me. When Morpheus missing the desert of the real he meant me. Like a monster I am simply, do the records into three. Let my music not really be confused with anybody. 'cause there's something like Mister Mohammed Ali in his prime. then I float like a butterfly and sting with the rhyme. and the mic happens ring with the nine. if it's drama let these niggaz tryin' to bring to my mind. I seem to remind that Thomas Crown is spoke. and if you don't love it you can shove a dick down your throat. I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be. If a nigga didn't make his entry. Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats. Waiting on my arrivlary. Y'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me. Instead of always comparin' me. If I hear one more remark about me. I guess I gotta ride on my enemies. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho - What I will nigga. Look at my eyes nigga, wakin' up early in the morning to the sun rise nigga. Momma yelling rise nigga get up out that bed snoarin'. if you want it go get it fuck havin' to beg for it. Even if you gotta break your neck I'm a releg for it. I said listen to behind a hot roller bread for it. Contemplating know how to work my math and bred story. I don't work my fingers to the bone until they bled storin'. So you can say that I'm a giant a preacher of habit. walking over these watches squaking the reach in the head with. niggaz watching me go free not just a week in my marriage. with the game in the cabbage with my name and my status. but I remain as the baddest motherfucker 's established. and I 'm still at it grounding that Hennessey straight popping that still mad at. Down at my enemies' face and you're like a kill habit. In front of my enemies' face I shit like a steal rabbit. To show I'm his real static and hold me ideal at it. With my poker face until I at least make a mil at it. At least make a meal love it I'm hungry and still clutch it. All for that mil ticket outta that steal lovin'. [Frank Lee White]. Well I was riding 95 to Virginia the other day. And I thought to myself ain't this where Timbaland used to stay. I heard he moved to New York City but he work in Miami. Only time he back round here is when he visit his granny. Now ain't it funny how the money make a man change. But shit Timmy I don't think he changed a damn things. 'xcept the rap game and bust the track game. shit he be gobbeling the grammies like he pac-man. can you get with that man let's gone take it back to the roots. before them backpacking rappers with them hoodies and boots. before Sam Goddie and MTV. before these killers and these hundred dollar billars feeling making MC. before the white rap explosion before the corrosion. when we was just getting started and them doo's wouldn't open. it was people like Timmy who was kickin' them in. shit whatcha cookin' in that kitchen again. some shit like that. [Timbaland]. I'm thinking 'bout what the music game might be. If a nigga didn't make his entry. Niggaz would be making them same ol' beats. Waiting on my arrivlary. Y'all niggaz gonna learn to appreciate me. Instead of always comparin' me. If I hear one more remark about me. I guess I gotta ride on my enemies. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho. Oho oho oho oho - Don't make me take it there. Oho oho oho oho - What I will nigga"

Not just neighbors, the whole damn town. Own flesh and blood, said I was a clown. But as the world turns, my life can too. And like a gun kills, a knife can too (yeah). I was stabbed thrice, how 'bout you?. Once by my mom, pops the other two. Child abuse kid, ward of the state. I know it was the past, but I just can't shake. How you had a kid, beat me like a slave. I was only three, how could I misbehave?. I didn't know better, you could teach me first. You said fuck that, then you beat me worse. It's pain in this verse, hard to go on (yeah). Oo is a man, so I must hold on. [Break - Timbaland]. I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes. And would you be prepared to see (would ya?). (Wyclef: yeah). A life full of money and a life full of girls. But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain). A lot of people yellin (""we love ya Maganoo""). But I know y'all really in need (ooo). I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner. (Wyclef: yeah). But I gotta grab all these leaves, uh huh. So I must ... [Chorus - Wyclef Jean]. You gotta hold on (hold on). But you got to be strong. Though the pain almost over. (Timbaland: my pain almost over). Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah. (Timbaland: I can't quit yet), can't quit. You gotta hold on (yeah). You got to be strong (yeah). (Timbaland: my pain almost over). Yeah, look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah (yeah). [Verse 3 - Wyclef Jean]. Yeah, yo, I seen Brooklyn turn into Crook-lyn. The youngn's they spend their life in central Crook-lyn (yeah). I've seen prom queens, turn into prom fiends. Sometime I ask myself what happen to Dr. King's ""Dream"" (yeah). I've seen best friends, turn to enemies. What made it sad, I had to sing at the eulogy. So hard for us to say goodbye. So I puff the lye and stay high (yeah). The man you said was your fam in the park (yeah). Saw your face spark when you found out he was a Narc (yeah). Cause everybody wanna be Nino Brown. They wanna be Nino Brown, they wanna be Nino Brown (yeah). And the girls they love the Nino Brown. They hug they Nino Brown, they lust for Nino Brown (yeah). And the fiends they want the Nino Brown. The way he hold you down, when he comes around (yeah) (*echo*). [Outro - Timbland - talking]. The pain never stops baby. Lele, I hope ya hear us. Cause life will never be the same without you girl. (Wyclef: yeah). Timbaland talkin to you. (Wyclef: yeah, yo, yo). We ain't used to nothin. This music industry, will never be the same without you. Nothin but pain, hard struggle. But me and Jimmy D, we're gonna keep ridin for ya. Cause life must go on. You must live on. So we gotta hold on, c'mon. (Hold on) uh, (hold on). My pain almost over (hold on, hold on).

I remember those days when I was holdin back. When Star Crunch was a popular snack. Would you buy you that, sneak the rest in my nuts. You know that Johnny Appleseed and that frozen cup. We grew up, but ain't you sister Jean cousin (cousin). Just cause we older that don't mean nothin (nothin). We still could hit the beacon, a couple of Bible meetings. Live right just like the deacons and backslide on the weekend. Now things change, not just your new love. See you never used to trip off material stuff. So I ain't mad at dude cause he rimmed up his truck. Just mad at you, you clumsy klutz. And it's no suprise how I'm feelin inside. So the only thing you ever probably did for my eye. Used to tears in the bucket, I hope you dummies loved it. Although it's over, you still my soldier (my soldier). [Chorus - Timbaland]. Cause I got love for ya. Can I get a hug from ya?. I'm not tryna point the finger and judge ya. Cause I make mistakes like you. I forgive ya boo. You can keep the things that I brought ya. I'm not tryna play correctional officer. I'm just tryna take them burdens off of ya. Cause I make mistakes like you. I forgive ya boo. [Verse 2 - Magoo]. I first met ya at the strip club. Instead of one, had to give ya two dubs. Right from sight baby, I was past love. It must be the fact, opposites attract. Do the addition, it's a one on one thing, and I'ma lace you with bling. Cause the way you make me feel is an incredible thing. But you had to hurt me, made love to my best friend. But just like ""Chucky"" I'ma stay 'til the very end. On top of that, you was usin crack and cocaine. You had oomph, had to throw my towel in mayn. I can't judge cause I cheated, you ain't hold no grudge. I had a child with her, baby it's warm in love. Then Christmas Eve we was playin two hand spades. You rolled on up, Ace I'm sorry but I have AIDS. But I'ma ride with you, until your death. And I'ma stay by your side, last heartbeat, last breath. [Chorus]. [Break - Timbaland]. I hope ya forgive me too, uh. I hope ya forgive me too (too), uh. I hope ya forgive me too (too). Be adults about the situation baby, c'mon. [Chorus]. [Timbaland - talking over Chorus]. Can I?. Go head. Uh uh. [Break - Timbaland]. I hope ya forgive me too, uh. I hope ya forgive me too (too), uh. I hope ya forgive me too (too).

indian carpet,"[timbaland]. Yo (yo), yo, ay yo. Timabaland's flow infamous. Allow me to assemble this flow with limitless style. For all man, woman and innocent child. I have no perimeter. Break all barriers in various areas. My sound is mimicked. Track prime minister, some say sinister. None stoppin the groove until when it's. The climax, some niggas is bitin my hot hats. And followed my drum pattern, but i done that. It's time to change, get more deranged. Feels more strange (doooodooooo). Follow me through gravel and shallow trees. From mountains to flat plain, to thunder and black rain. Through the dream state of utopia. Woke up to the sounds of that man timbaland. Five mexican bitches scopin us. Belly dancin, sayin hell, he's handsome in spanish. We was fine until the subtitles vanished. Then and open fire, totin opium. Higher than i ever been in my life. Heard cries throughout the night like. [chorus: static]. Let's get 'em started. While they dance on, indian carpet. C'mon, uh. Niggas act retarded. While they dance on, indian carpet. C'mon, uh. Let's get 'em started. While they dance on, indian carpet. [timbaland]. Ay yo, i woke up to a bowl of rice like the golden child. T.v. playin like the poltergeist, must been on overnight. I saw a strong beam of light, decided to walk to it. Could it be the son of christ, i decided to talk to it. In the halls i heard music shoutin beautiful calls. And i swore i heard a voice say:. It's yours my, gift to you, to do what you choose. But i suggest you do what you do to make the spirits move. I hear ya dude, and me bein a barrel of fruit. But your ears heavenly, when i sit in this chair and produce. Then my hallway darkened. I felt a power surge rush throughout my apartment. And the glance callin like. [chorus]. [magoo]. Mag spit with a sense of purpose on purpose. When you was eatin collard greens i was eatin these dreams. I stepped in dog shit and bit skid row twice. Only ice i had put it in my orange slice. What you know about livin in a jail when it ain't no bars. Handcuffed with no key, world denyin your plea. A third-degree charge when it ain't no crime. Twenty-six years old and i got more time. Phone overdue, baby on the way, low pay. Low rent for your mom, gotta get away. Smoke, hate now, then you wanna talk about the ghetto. I'm tenth generation of that, came out the womb with a hat. Polo on and nikes with a gold tooth. I'm superman, i can spit from any phone booth. You and your cold ass crew do what you do. Just remember mag never feel good, i am the flu. [chorus]"

insane,"[Timbaland]. Ahh! Whoa! Feel it? Ugh!. This here is one of those joints you just ride out. Get your thoughts together. ""GG"" talk to me. [Candice ""Gg"" Nelson]. I like you cuz you are above average. So I might do things you don't understand. But I like to correct your bad habits. Cuz I want to make you an honest man. [Timbaland]. Huh! I got some precise questions bout my past life. Wondering why we so close to buildings on this last flight. Pray at night and keep my ""Run"" posted by the door. DMC above like Jason falling to the floor. My mind can carry of a picture perfect. Of my Aunt Mary. Her face in the mirror like she wasn't burried. I drink Hypnotiq let my conscience go (go). [Magoo]. Tim you need to take it slow (slow). [Timbaland]. These endless songs got me waking up in cold sweats. What gets the real time wondering where Aaliyah at. I got a wife that watch another girl give me neck. Fix my lunch with plastic wrap up on my pita bread. I'll bite my tongue but she's so outspoken. To that box of Saran bust her head wide open. Handcuffs open my fists go up for Eminem. And when he's walking out his courtcase. I'll be walking in. (Chorus). I know you're safe (Whoooooo). You're gonna stay (Whoooooo). But your mind could change (Whoooooo). I'm going insane (Whoooooo). I'm going crazy!. (Repeat). [Magoo]. You know them days when you troubled inside. All you think about fuck paying bills. You ignore em' you gone drink it out. That's the way that I feel as I am writing this. Sit back roll up a blunt take some delight in this. You been invited to a piece of my sanity. And vanity is absent does that weaken the man in me. My fantasy on side man reality bites. Who can't believe all these rappers let alone what he writes. I wasn't forced to lie to yall but I did. I don't own a plane or yacht or eat squid but. I'm entertaining there will be no explaining. I'm criticized for having fun. Killings more enovating they say. But anyway however ignorance chooses food. Its rude to tell you how you have been screwed. And I'm a part of the problem. And its racking my brain. Excuse me miss I'm half fool half insane. (Chorus). [Timbaland]. I can't believe that the world is so cold. That's why I keep a runny nose. And I wish my problems would go (Oh). People don't know me. People don't ask me no questions. Bris Sparky D was an injustice. The greatest rappers man suffered depressions. So I'm signing niggas while Whodini's taking the publishing. My mind state is like the crime rate. A high percentage of your royalties is in my bank. New artists when you're trying to break. I'm prewarning you before you even hand me your tape (Let's go!). (Chorus)"

This is what Thomas do, piss on my mark then I get back to you. [Chorus] x2. Cause I'm leaving on the next plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Why don't you just call up all your friends. And let's get something started. [Verse: Attitude]. I'm only in town for two days, two nights only. I'm hoping that you wanna spend these two nights on me. I like your home girls you like my homies. We ain't really tryna spend these two night lonely. Shawty, really ain't much I'm asking for. A little conversation, a nice piece of ass to go. I like penetration, how you like it fast or slow?. Only a hip, nobody has to know. She looking at me, weighing up her options. She ready to leave, and go get it poppin'. What could be the fact that I got there. Drop top Benz or that single in the top 10?. I dunno but whatever it is gotta……crunk. She grabbing her liquor, coming out of Prada. I told her I'ma pimp it, I ain't coming out a dollar. Let's go! I'm leaving gonna be out of here tomorrow. [Chorus] x2. [Verse: Magoo]. Girl you lookin' right in those jeans. You been eating colligreens?. That's obscene, your man don't help you make beans?. You have a house, 2 kids, and he working. There's rumors, he and your best friend been flirting. But I ain't tryna fuck you tonight. Your ass big, but your face hmmmm that look alright. I tell you what, I'ma make an exception. Clothes off, that's the truth. Clothes on is deception. Aw, yea, a macilent conception. Front or the back, hit in any direction. And baby you the cause of my erection. Stop at Wal-Greens I'ma buy some protection. Fuck that, go and put it in my face girl. I really have a need to give you face girl. You said you dreamed if sex with a star. Make up your mind, Oo be on a jet tomorrow. [Chorus] x2"

But still though I got (love for you). Single mothers I got (love for you). Fuck niggaz who hatin I got (love for you). Middle fingers I keep'em (up for you). Couple bottles with models.

Got you where I want yo ass. In the case of an emergency, break the glass. Keep yo eyes on the President, erase the past. We be happy if we had more blunts to pass. Get done up and run up. And the guts of yo butt don't shake like they used to. I wake 'em up like a rooster. Take it slow, not faster than a turbo rooster. No worry, no hurry. No pain, no gain. Keep yo eyes on strain.

Big body, too, just like i walked out the gym. Man, i'm sppeding through, not just feeling the wind. Look, the needle to the gas tank is right at the end. Now, i'm needing to sin, lying again. Pumpin' gas in the benz, with no money to spend. And every kid that walk in, cashier turning again. So it's a good thing that lady walked in her twins. [repeat chorus]. [magoo]. All i do is listen to eightball, with the hoes on call. High dank in my gas tank and eat raw franks. Grill in my bed and serve 2 steak and siemen. And i'm scheming on your daughter with on condom and clairborne. Don't get it twisted, i'm gold-toothed and two-fisted. Both arms ready to roll, chrome-wristed. I'm past being beserk, i go to work. Tell the boss go 'head give me some sugars and hot sauce. With an atrack of diana ross playing. And drunk off some moonshine, i passed out and woke up at noontime. Thought it was crack of dawn, but ass was in my face. Said them draws was versache, i thought she had versace. [repeat chorus]"

On the bikes, but they look like cars, it's somethin' new. and Jada talk soo good, but 'cha brain is. Nowhere next to ready for this stainless. It's no helpin' you when them thangs melt in you. and way down in Athens, Jada's a bell ringer. I'ma bring the hood to the farm. Bless 'em with some purple hay. Remove the wood from the barn. Introduce them to the yak and cranberry. and make sure Bubba Spark good, then I'm gone. Even if we run the war, I'ma still run the raw. You can come and see me, I got 'em for twenty-four. Double R and Beat Club, who hard as us?. R3: In The ""R"" We Trust, c'mon. [Timbaland]. Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready. They don't know know.

The streets is still mine, I stay with the still nine. and it's still long and if I'm stronger than corn like I pinkeyed. Niggaz pretend to be weeded, that's what the industry needed. Kiss flippin' his flow, enemies heated. But we gon' let the gats pop. From the old rifles on the dirt road to the handguns on the blacktop. Don't get the plot wrong, this ain't a black or white politic thing. Cocksucker, it's a hot song. [Timbaland]. Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready. They don't know know.

time,"I got a feeling she keeps me in the dark. I gotta get keep my eye on her, she ain't no walk in the park. I offered this but she want that, she she - she want it all. You see she wanted to paint the picture and say she my broad. I got a little tip from the word on the block, People saying i shouldn't get involved,. But i didn't judge or try to change it, Cause you are who you are.... I'm like the drug she's addicted to me, She can't leave me now. she always making plans to date, Come and find me tomorrow - goodbye girl.... -Chorus-. She's too invested in the hours that pass her by,. I'd pay attention if i thought it was worth the time,. I tell her easy but her hands they find a way,. Confusing passion for the love we never gave,. Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance,. Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past,. I tell her easy but her hands they find a way,. Confusing passion for the love we never gave.... I couldn't get rid of shorty if i wanted, 'Cause she was down but. i was tired of playin' the role, like i ain't know that she get around, Something 'bout this girl fascinates me,. She's the type that like to hang with the stars,. The way she makes me feel it sedates me,. Who knew we would take it this far.... Everywhere that i try to go, she got a wanted poster with my face on it,. Soon as i walk out the door, there it is, Wanted poster up with my face on it,. Can't blame myself when it's not - my fault,Cause nothing is. promised - at least i can say i was honest... Goodbye girl. Chorus x1. Instrumental Break. Chorus x1"

Carry my city on my back. Like a crucifix. For more than a decade. Cuz I can do this sh*t. A lot of people want my spot. But I don't hesitate. The track label by legacy. Won't appreciate. I stand strong. Everything I put my hands on. Me and Mr. I-Be. Cuz ain't no I in team. Cuz I can hear 'em sayin. Timothy where have you been. Its not what it seems but it is.

tomorrow in the bottle (feat. chad kroeger & sebastian),"All I Wanna do is makeup (6x). (Timbaland). Broken promises, broken weddin vows. It's hard looking down, no not even. (Crack a smile 2x).

If there's some way that we can take back, the wrong that we've created. We can change that, don't turn your head the other. way. You're gonna save today, but tomorrow in the bottle. Let's put tomorrow in the bottle (8x). Pack it up, seal it up, close (the deal 2x). (Timbaland). Girl you ain't right, I apologize. Don't be satisfied, to what we had was gone away. Every other day we cuss we fight and two wrongs don't make right. You had my head gone, I did you dead wrong. Singin that same old song, wonderin why you mad (at me 2x). Now you understand my lingo, we still gon'be people. Baby this is how it should be, I knew you'd be like that. You was sposed to have my back. Now we both don't know how to act, Once I leave the door at my baby back. (Chad). I waited for the that day, together we can find. another way back.

Cuz my back against the wall. Now the conclusion to the story is the same. I was your bread and butter, like I put you on. Now that I want that loving back,. Why's relationship so gone like we estabilished the fact. That you was wrong from the get, how am I sposed to fly in my ex. From Tallahasee and back, when a girl is scared of. heights. Said have you seen them jets, now put her in the back. When the first class got delayed the snacks, people can blame my past. People can kiss my ass, I'm at a loss for words. Chad gon' singin the rest. (Chad). I waited for the that day, together we can find. another way back. But everything we've got at stake, let's worry about today and put tomorrow in the bottle.. If there's some way that we can take back, the wrong that we've created. We can change that, don't turn your head the other. way. You're gonna save today, but tomorrow in the bottle.
