Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind. This is not no Sandra Bull, but you're Potion #9. Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs. And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride. And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush. Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh. Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside. I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's. I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right. Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right. I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight. Easy baby you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine. Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?. Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups. I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right. With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name, it ain't important babe cuz I'mma call you Mine. [Hook: Miguel]. We're living in a fantasy. I feel it when you dance with me. It's feeling like you need to be. My lady, my baby, yeah. Can't you see. I'm talking about eternity. Tell me would you care to be.

100 hunnit,"(Wale). I promised Ricky and Milly that I'ma kill it. Running throughout them digits, and Dollars on me I'm on it. I'm running I'm so 100 with every nigga I run with. Tell them niggas we coming, we f-cking it up this summer. (Meek Mill). And I'm stunting like it ain't nothing, most of these niggas fronting. I pull this Rolly from Travi, and I got this Beamer from nothing. If they ain't talking bout paper, just tell them end of discussion. And now that I'm getting money, my neighbors turn to my cousins. (Wale). Gold bottles, lot of bitches. Didn't think I'm sorry I'm such a shallow nigga. The mind on me just shine on them, you shadow women. Went out with rats you niggas should be in glass slippers. (Meek Mill). Ha, and I don't ever ask the price on it. Married to the money hater, throw some rice on it. I told my jeweler get my Mueller, throw some mimes on it. I treat that p-ssy like it's Tina, I go Ike on it. Beat it up, I'm getting heated up. When I say I'm high, I ain't talking weed it up. (Wale). Bitch I'm talking G5, Titobero?, ? out. Beaters on my sneakers, even though I never be with Dex. B and me, train hi up. (Meek Mill). He lying I'm on papers. But when I beat this shit off, ima go and buy some Lakers. Yea I'm talking bout that Cali kush, We can work in?. Two bad bitches in the back, they prettier than ratty look. (Wale). Bitch I'm hot as Wasabi in Abu Dhabi. In a sauna with some models, we treat them like?. I ain't thugging, I ain't robbing, I'm puffing on my broccoli. Doing 100 in a bucket, be like 20 in a 'rari. (Meek Mill). And I'm back on this shit again,uP"
2 a days make you stronger (feat. kanye west),"[Wale talking]. So yeah like. I'm not really like worried about fucking up or you know what. I'm sayin'. The plight of a rapper or whatever. Or the trials of tribulations. Cause you know, aside from me strugglin'. or coming up in one of the most. Fucked up, hating ass areas in the world. I played football for twelve years you know. And anybody who plays sports, you know you got politics. And you got all the other bullshit. So I'mma talk about a little bit of that. And I'mma stop rappin' and start rappin' now. So drop the slam and let's get sick. [Verse 1: Wale]. Halfback toss to right. Yeah the coach used to say I was awesome, right. O.D. was in the weight room all his life. But I was more self concerned with the broads in life. Im always on the yard like farmers. Never in class. Dorm room hoppin' if workouts optional. Im not rockin'. I can run an option best in my conference. Look at my accomplishments, I'm all county. You double A niggas should be lucky y'all signed me. Lucky y'all found me, lucky y'all stole me. I could be with Bowden, I could be with Friedgen. Two a day curfews, where's my Freedom?. School ain't even start yet, there ain't not freaks here. Might as well prepare. Season opener, finna be there. When the depth chart came, there was no me there. I mean me is there, but it's like three there. Which made me have to wait like leap year. Cause I ain't really lift weights, I didn't need them. I run a 4.4, so they won't catch me there. Knocking on my coach door like a missionary. Playbook like a Oxford dictionary. Attitude that was not really felling. And he put me on ice, I was oxen literally. I keep talking, I keep talking. My scholarship won't straight like Rodman. So Im walking. Fuck it, Im leaving. Vsu next season. Peace. [Hook: Kanye West]. I need you right now. I need you right now. You know how long I've been on ya. Since Prince was on Apollonia. Since O.J. had Isotoners. Don't act like I never told ya. [Verse 2: Wale]. They say, Trojans never break but it ain't that. For God sake, you can call coach Faison. I've seen dreams turn dust, cause he made them. Cause he played them, when he ain't played them. I've seen niggas loose cool, niggas leave school. And back to the block with nothing better to do. Vsu don't regret you. Just regret the fact that I left too soon. I got kicked off, I used to shit talk. Excuse my complaint, but I got to get it off. Hey Mr. coach, I don't like you. You don't me, that don't mean I gotta move. You see the way I move, I am in another gear. You can ask Los, I was like a young Gayle. My coach ain't care, so I ain't care. He ain't even respect the name, he said Whale. So I said yeah, and he was like yeah. You fumbled in a drill, young man get on the hill. So Im like fuck it, Im out get on your head. Such Karma, next year they 4-6. A few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit. And now I only listen to this hip-hop shit. A few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit. Man fuck this shit. [Hook]. [Verse 3: Wale]. I go, in when I start putting words out. Words sharp like a Jerry Rice curl route. Im moonshine, y'all merlot. I got on, and I gotta thank Marlon. Thank Kenny Burns, though we not talking. But my squad like the 72' Dolphins. Climate Shula, my flow Csonka. Im so Bonkas, Im not conscious. They are not confident when Im talking. Make them more insecure when they caught one. He tried tossing to Andre Johnson. Now Im getting compliments on how charming I am. And Im way out London, way out conscious. Y'all never seen. Exclusives, y'all never seen. They wait on my return, I am Az-Zahir Hakim. Write it in my leisure, I rather go shopping. Gucci & Nike, that's what I call an option. Um Tom Frazier, new Lebron haters. Got you niggas all over my bars just like Frasier. I've become immune to you no name haters. They can not pause like right one sega. I get inspired about your make up. You no good like a stripper with a ""A"" cup. Young Arrington, coming for you Aikman. Aye Jay, 8 grand skins gonna take that. Aye Bo, 10 stacks on the Patriots. Aye Rich, another 5 on the G Men. Another 5, Eli won't even be there. No Strahan, y'all need to rebuild. Back to you homo spittin so, so. You can't kick it like Romo hold for ya. No more for the broke I am more so. A first rounder, y'all don't want a Russell. I must go like fly route. My tires align with the play, but the times out. Yeah hail Mary full of grace. I swear these off rhyme bums are full of hate. Young Peyton don't huddle, still run my play. Still run that break, still get my ring, still run my shit. And it ain't no thing, you in Dungy's dungeon. So get that straight, yeah get that straight. Ain't nothing to Peyton. I am Marvin with mind, but I listen to Wayne. And I listen to 'Ye. Still listen to Big. And I listen to Jay. They are the coaches in this. And I listen to thought. And I listen to Common. We have nothing in Common. The shit that I spit is more"
3 days 3 hours,"Can't be without you, baby. Not even for a night. And so I've been thinking lately. Of being with you for all time. MM, it's four-thirty in Eastern time where I'm at, shorty. In the A. M. , I'm sayin' though, where you at, shorty?. I'm happy without you but got my doubts, shorty. Like, like if my currency dry out, would you be out thirsty?. Would your mind want me, like your soul want me?. When I go down on you, I drown for quarter centuries. You a whole globe, you a whole earth. And I'm a troubled millionaire that fears you know your worth. Absence makes the heart grow fonder so we ponder. On the things we gon' do when distance ain't a problem. Our intentions, they was honest, we was cordial, we was talkin'. We was hidin', there was no one, we was lyin', it was fuckin'. Foreplay with your body divided now. It's forehead kisses before my flight departed, that. Showed me the feelings, about to play with that. Three days away, three hours back, hold on. [?]. Ain't got no voice. Where my phone? Who got my phone? You got my phone?. She called me, hold on man. (You have reach the voicemail box). Hol' up. Just got off the stage, know you sleepin', but wait. Just lost my voice for this crowd I only seen your face in Everywhere, but these women real as a fairy tale. Can barely talk but you hit my line, I'ma hear you well. I need that vibe from you 'cause spendin' time on this bus. Take the power from my brain, in-between your thighs they should rest. We alive, we in love, we can die if we don't. If monogamy you want then share your time with Pornhub. I'm just playin', just need you know I'm lonely. Green Tea, Ricola and honey, gold, we. Missin' each other more so we horny or don't speak. Three hours apart, cool, two days and you seein' me. My vocals is now shot, call up doctor, steroid me. We cortisone 'til my quarter zone is back as your toy please. I know you don't need nothin' but what I got. Two days away, three hours back, goodnight. (Baby without you, baby). We one tomorrow away from celebratin' that that very tomorrow's the day (not even for a night). I know it's late but I'ma hit you later. (And so I been thinkin lately of bein' with you for all time). I'm on the way, you know. Once you know my voice back. 'Cause see like a hunnid forevers plus a day since I last seen the livin' embodiment of my forever. Face to face and I might just inject your body with knowledge. Your body with style, you'll be flyer thanrox Brown. Okay, I'm lyin', nobody flyin' than Rox. But I might just get in a half squat position and proposition you with a shiny rock under an open box. So the onlookers can understand that we all official. We all just kids lookin' for the first love we ever injected. So whenever I'm never next to you, I never look to the next woman even on her best moment to bestowed. A stove you kept warm for me, as I kept distance you kept cookin'. Sugar, we went from three days and three hours 'til we two days and three hours to, ""girl he think he Darius Lovehall, he walkin' down the street writin' poetry to make the between yo' knees feel like you need balance"". And I see you alot but I see you on camera so it seem like a lie when I say I need to see us together. From three days to two days, from two days to today. From today to tonight, from tonight to forever, I'm up the street"
90210,"[Chorus]. And she throws up whatever she eats. She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed. Regular girl, Celebrity dreams. She is...(90210). She live her whole life like tv. And she would do anything for everything. Regular girl, Celebrity dreams. She is...(90210). [Verse 1]. Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go. Part-time waitress she really wanna make it. In the ""City of Lights"", it's hard to see clear. She don't really care about anyone advice. Nothing here's real, and everyone's alike. Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life. She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light. Indulging a meal when a toilets in sight. Expose those fries, can't hold those down. To be seven pounds, you must release several pounds. This is Heaven on Hell. This is how she wanna live. She ain't really trippin', she's on Beverly Hills. [Chorus]. And she throws up whatever she eats. She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed. Regular girl, Celebrity dreams. She is...(90210). She live her whole life like tv. And she would do anything for everything. Regular girl, Celebrity dreams. She is...(90210). [Verse 2]. Just another day out in Beverly Hills. She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still. Believing the screens or anything there. But reality shows ain't real. So pretentious with no potential. She goes to catch up, although her rents up. In her defense-she part of the crowd. She gonna borrow some money. So she can party at Chows. It's apart of her goal. It's all she knows. Graduated from rosay, addicted to blow. Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow. So she kisses the stars. And gives them a blow. After every show, a dream she hold. Inhibition is gone, she just wanna be known. She wanna be know, she just wanna be known. Pulling down her skirt. ""I never done this before"", Nah. [Chorus]. And she throws up whatever she eats. She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed. Regular girl, Celebrity dreams. She is...(90210). She live her whole life like tv. And she would do anything for everything. Regular girl, Celebrity dreams. She is...(90210). [Verse 3]. You know big-breast girls. Never ever pay rent. They meet the Rich Boys. Throw D's on that Bitch. Lease on The Whip. Beach on the weekend. Hotel suite, room keys is a gift. Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger. Now you just a whore to the male entertainers. Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick. The sun's always out. But It's clouds over here. Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction. To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims. Hold on you can see my vision. Next to you let down on a nigga. [Chorus]. And she throws up whatever she eats. She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed. Regular girl, Celebrity dreams. She is...(90210). She live her whole life like tv. And she do anything for everything. Regular girl, Celebrity dreams. She is...(90210)"

But this shit so wack and the chips must stack,. there will be no Frito Lay. Ok, I'm winning competition who is it?. Ralph in that new edition and that's no Ralphy ?. All my posse official and my policies simple. Keep your faith in your God, family over the business. Here niggas be at odds and get even with pistols. Ed Hochuli nah, my partners is more official.

bad (feat. tiara thomas),"Monogamy or whatever you call it. I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody. Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying. You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge. Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does. Let's get it. Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it. But I sure know how to fuck. I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it too you. I can't promise that I'll be good to you. Cause I had some issues, I won't commit. No, not having it. But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you). Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you. Bad that I never made love, no I never did it. But I sure know how to fuck. Lets get it. Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun. And the hood girls want a smart nigga,. college girls all want a thug. So it seems we fiend for what we don't need. Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave. I'm not bout to judge you, don't judge me. You ain't really gotta sing about your rap sheet. Cause I heard you (bad nooo). In the literal sense I mean that. Rough sex saying I love yah. But to kiss them saying you mean that. I know I just be calling her mean ass. Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed. But the problem is it's probably a deep past. Still I'm feeling of something I need bad. Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this. I don't need emotions to open your deep sea. I can see the ocean by going between legs. Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope. Go, for it, couch, now. Slow, mo-tion, around, put it down. Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up. Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it. But I sure know how to fuck. [. From: http://www.elyrics.net .]. I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it too you. I can't promise that I'll be good to you. Cause I had some issues, I won't commit. No, not having it. But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you). Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you. Bad that I never made love, no I never did it. But I sure know how to fuck. Let me tell you about, look. She hurt feelings, she break hearts. She stay quiet, she play smart. She take pride, in going out. Getting hollered at, and saying nah. She no saint, but she don't pose. She don't wear make up by the boat load. Riding through lake shore with the nose up. She don't really date much but it slows her up. She got haters, but we all do. Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through. Baby look at they approach how they court you. All those minds games nevermind cause they all lose. In the physical sense I mean that. I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas. I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope. Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look. Shawty is actually in prevent. Cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep. Bed, floor, couch, more. More, shower, Lord, perm. Done, love, nah. Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn. Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it. But I sure know how to fuck. I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it too you. I can't promise that I'll be good to you. Cause I had some issues, I won't commit. No, not having it.

bad girls club,"[J. Cole - Chorus]. She’s a star if I ever seen one. Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one. So now I’m under pressure I want it bad. She got something I never had. I see ya looking at me. [Wale]. Bad bitches get low. Bad bitches get low right now. Bad bitches get low. Bad bitches get low right now. [Wale - Verse 1]. Wale and we are not the same. Got bread in the diesel, got diesel in the check?. Rock Steady, me and my nigga Cole. Leave me a couple minutes, you leave me a couple hoes. Quite gifted, ambitions of life living. Despite living with more attention than light skinned, women. Ok you think a nigga shallow?. Ok, you probably think I get ‘em all with the cash flow. Actually I like a broad that can bag hoes. That's how I rope em all down. See my last hoe (work). Blast off (work). Get involved. Gas women then return ‘em like a rental car. That's one show, that's fifty large. Nigga I just glow, bright as any Debarge. I’m just tryna get ya comfortable. And its amazing what some liquor and a blunt’ll do. [J. Cole - Chorus]. Please show love, make way for the bad girls club. Please show love, make way for the bad girls club. [J. Cole - Verse 2]. Hey, Cole World. Down for whatever. Boy got Dollars, Pounds or whatever. Being broke and its a Diddy ass world.

Red dots cause I’m red hot. Seen, dead girl you smoking. I get paper like I a mail box, seen. But girl you got me open. Proceed, pocket fu"

chain music,"Dmv up, roll up and kick my feet up. This shit was for a ticket, man -- I call that shit that free lunch. I tell a ho to speed up. She slow and she can keep up. We know we always out. But somehow they would never see us. Peep her gold chain, hoes changed, I didn't. They say that karats help your vision. But somehow it made them listen. No this ain't silver, this is my dilemma. Arrogant when I finish. I came from humble beginnings. So it's nothing to finish. I put my hundred percent in. Put my pride in the pen, cuh. And modify your opinion. Trying to give them light and a message. But you rather have some fucking V.V.S's. She said I'm charming and I meant it. But she was talking about my pendant. I got geechi on her, came back with thirty chains. Now she attentive, I bet she listen to everything. Straight geechi on her, came back with eighty chains. Now them silly bitches calling me like everyday. Now them broads gon' follow. (Chain so big, can't pop my collar). Silly bitches gon' follow. (Chain so big, can't pop my collar). Straight geechi on 'em. You talking greasy. Best believe they gon' see it, darling. Geechi on 'em. Straight geechi on 'em. Let's keep it G, nobody see you when you being humble. Look, she so stingy with vagina. But why it open when them niggas get to shining?. I was hoping you would notice where my mind at. Put money in the book, I bet these bitches wouldn't find it. Look, okay this chain music, fuck how them lame's do it. You chained to it, your brain has been way too influenced. I been dope, cold nigga for sure nigga. But where I'm from there ain't no love for no broke nigga. She seen that geechi shit, ain't been to church since. Pray to whoever got on the biggest of crucifix. Lord Lord forgive us, personality clash. And my license is suspended, so I hide it. I don't spend it, did I get y'all attention?. She can't escape the chain, shoutout to Mrs. Tubman. Shoutout to Maybach Music, my logic is getting money. Spitting something real, let the people know, and still love it. Shady flow: Johnny Cage, chain flow: Johnny Dang. Ben Baller, six bottles, talk with such expensive slang. I got geechi on 'em, now they notice a nigga. So who that chain change? It ain't both of us nigga. I got geechi on her, came back: a hundred chains. And now these geechi mother f-ckers all know my name. Geechi on her, came back: a million chains"

More club moves, I call her, no answer. Her phone in the bag she dancin. Its four now the clubs ova. I call her but oh hold up. ya’ll know what ignore button. or the phone died lets hope for it. that damier bag I bought caught the attention of those niggas on it. that cell phone that I bought is probably filled wit some other niggas numbers. so it leaves me to wonder. why do I still promise to love ha. cut me off every time im talkin. which means she aint never hear nothing. I say stay she wanna leave. She get her point across so I gotta let her be. Imma let her be by herself in peace but five years from now I bet she see. When the club gets played and things you crave are no longer escapes. And no longer for dates you wanna husband but no one has a cape.

dc or nothing,"[Intro]. In the face of adversity, I prepared a verse to see. Or hear rather.... [Verse 1]. Destined to win, get respect where I live. My reflection contagious, I’m the messenger here. Making love to the streets, they be lusting for bread. They ain’t sleeping until they know every customer fed. When the city was chocolate, there was death in the air. All I’m hearing is aids, I ain’t deaf in my ear. Nah [?] I ain’t deaf in my ear. But he push them whites in the hood like ray evans was there. Shout out to Kirbo, he told me I would make it. Now me, Tony, G, and Tre got the keys to the nation. Pray for peace with the babies, they a beast in the summer. Of course he fiending for trouble, he had a fiend for a mother. Got no leaders among him, got no loyalty either. Once the police get to cuffing, bet his homie deceive him. See, it’s cold where they be at, on that boat like a pirate. Politicians fucking hookers, why you mad at my ganja?. Kick him out of the city, force them whites who can pay up. Still different ablers killing over what isn’t theirs. Lost my nigga over nothing though. Saheed Elesha I miss you, god bless my brother’s soul. [Hook]. I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home. Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home. And oh, I gotta find my way. Oh I gotta face the day. But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home. [Verse 2]. Look, I lost my nigga over nothing though. Saheed Elesha I miss you, god bless my brother’s soul. Ricky is sitting, Baba was sitting. Caught up and slipping for fearing a McDonald’s position. Seen it over a dollar, got him under a flower. Funeral drama, niggas mystery baby mamas. They ain’t really for condoms, I just think that it’s shocking. Got no fear in no officer, they be scared of them doctors. I’m aware that there’s problems, know Obama gon’ stop it. Where there’s minimal conscious and there’s thousands of choppers. I know Howard that college, but that town has some problems. I done seen embalming fluid ruin a nigga promise. Little women be mommas, little niggas ain’t fathers. Ain’t nobody here leading, it’s way too easy to follow. They knee deep in today, ain’t too fond of tomorrow. Although it gets you paper, I pray you weighing your options. This is soulful my nigga, I’m hoping I am giving a hope to my nigga. We just soldiers my nigga, don’t know you my nigga but know you my nigga. This is soulful my nigga, hope that I am giving some hope to my nigga. We just soldiers my nigga, don’t know you my nigga but know you my nigga. Nigga, know you my.... And you know my nigga. Know you my.... Look.... [Hook]. [Verse 3]. A king's assassination is why most often fear the hell. So needless to say this, leadership is not with a timid sail. I pray these words live and these gimmicks fail and. I pray whenever I’m seen in my city I forever resemble braille. May your trees be loud, and your queens be proud. May you see your dreams allowed, before you see them from a cloud. May your glass never reach half-empty, may your enemies find the inner-piece before it ever get to beef. I wish you, wealth, health, and pact free women for yourself and the shit ain’t the best, hope these lyrics help...my nigga. [Hook]. [Outro]. See I made it from home, see I made it alone. And all these peasant motherfuckers take shots at the throne. Time after time, again and again. They wanna see a nigga lose but I’m destined to win"
diary (feat. marsha ambrosius),"If I told you I wanted to talk to you. You think I'm try'na holla at you. And maybe I am but. You wouldn't hear me out anyway's would you?. Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like. Short days, long nights. By the phone, no call. Need a clear mind 'cause I been blind. Got me goin' down that road. Heart made of stone. Far away from home. Black woman you cold. Every problem you ever had with another man I gotta face. Started off on thin ice. I'm still here but I can't skate. Slow sink, can't breath, no remorse, don't think. Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat. Queen, you deserve the title but she rejects what I give. While she nurse the wounds by them. Tried them, didn't work, got impossible standards. Nothing I'm a do is gon' work. Diary of a black girl. I wonder why I sit and cry. Wish I could shed all these tears. I'm down and out. I'll keep on moving and tryna get out. I don't know how to move on. Where I went wrong. I wish I could live with no fear. So down and out. I'll keep it moving and tryna get out. Somehow. Raised by a momma who, who. Hates her baby father so, so. She don't have a problem with, with. Saying fuck a nigga Quick, quick. I'm just tryna be the one who never run. But you run away from me. Girlfriends man cheat, cheat. Why not me the same thing. She can't see in me, what I see in her. This pain she inherit can't be reversed. I can't even stay living in the shade of all. The motherfuckers who played you. The irony in that is that I aint even that. But you put in these pages. Wife, you deserve the label but. But, you been hurt before so you don't feel your able. Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards. Nothing that I ever do works. Diary of a black girl. I wonder why I sit and cry. Wish I could shed all these tears. I'm down and out. I'll keep on moving and tryna get out. I don't know how to move on. Where I went wrong. I wish I could live with no fear. So down and out. I'll keep it moving and tryna get out. Somehow. See all I wanna do is be relevant. Just tell me that I ever meant anything more. That you could ever see me and you in another light. But its like the dark women indoors. In the darkest nights by the wrong man,. see all of them have made you incapable of a first impression. what it do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna. Just intentions to impress you if capable. Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you. Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind. For such an ugly picture and. Money, nothing I buy can buy more time. For your ears to tell your heart to listen to it. Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say. But believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gonna shine anyways. and everyday that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary. the day before is better than the present. so anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences. there's no key for release. no reason to be around. her minds in the clouds. she writes it all down. in her diary. I wonder why I sit and cry. Wish I could shed all these tears. I'm down and out. I'll keep on moving and tryna get out. I don't know how to move on. Where I went wrong. I wish I could live with no fear. So down and out. I'll keep it moving and tryna get out. Somehow"

Fuck how they feel, I keeps it realer than a documentary. Shit I be feeling like real niggas don't make it to 50. And I be feeling malcolm, martin, and pac would defend me. I focus on chicken, my corazon frigid. Don't trust no cheap rubbers, don't trust no dirty bitches. Sipping moscato with models having exotic dishes.

I was pacing myself, hope you patient as me. Plus I got a lot, niggas ain't make it to see it. We black niggas with ambition, they gon respect it. And I know I'm kinda vain, but what real nigga isn't. I'm tryna style on some bitches and keep it introspective. I'm tryna stun em like everybody was second guessed it. Wale.

legendary,"Top of the dome wit it, or wrote lyrics. They ain't grossing a million liquid, don't form an opinion. I'm sort of a genius, nothing short of a legend. Sort of tommy lasorda. The way I'm sorting these pitchers. Pictures whatever, fuck it my speech is off. We can trip into wherever, only heaven is far. Metaphors in every color, these indelible bars. Jordan 4 seated floorside sitting with mars. Only fear is mediocrity. So every time I got a beat I feel like I don't gotta sleep. You keep praying on your break, I hope you got a sling. Shot for all them shots coming out them beaks. Sort of like socrates in a prada tee. You can't kick it, your pockets thinner than soccer teams. People fucking with me, they ain't fucking with you. Lyrically top hmm, being generous too. I remember a nigga demo just sit in a room. Made some moves, now I'm known to spit december in june. Rented a coupe - cool - met me a chick. Always keep a rubber, word to telly in kids. If you gon do it you gon do it, go handle your biz. Or smoke some purp take a percocet and xanax and chill. For real, you real then you don't need to say it. It's something to be great, it's nothing to be famous... Fuck fame, fuck money. Fuck everything anyone can take from me. It ain't hard to make money. We young niggas, we just tryna be legendary. Zoning my second bottle, focused still on tomorrow. Sober thoughts keep me anxious, moet gon' keep me calmer. Poetry keep her honest, these readings stevie could draw up. Don't see this deeper than music, don't hear it but feel the author. I don't hear no talking, we just hear them barking. And you know you run shit when they pay you good for walk-ins. Failure is not a option, success is just a process. Say ""yes"" one time they use you, say ""no"" one time they plotting. Didn't make it through college, still debating my progress. End some friendships with homies, made some haters with albums. Limitation's for cowards, this is che mixed with malcolm. This is anti mark mcguire it takes patience for power. Zoning my 6 -rillo legendaries forever. Roll a nick of that lala - that's how I plays it - mellow. Niggas plotting against you, hate you but never tell you. And I know my haters want to make my heart beat acapella. Hella proper, my garment is propeller of chopper. Cause I hella copped em so I could be way flyer than all them. I aspire for awesome and require some flossing. Only way they gon listen, find it highly unfortunate. Tryna see if real lyric spittin can buy me a porsche. Tryna see if I get my critics as silent as auctions. I decided to boss up, life's a bitch and I court her. Don't always fuck me good, I'm just too cheap to divorce her. Fuck fame, fuck money. Fuck everything anyone can take from me. It ain't hard to make money. We young niggas, we just tryna be legendary"
letter (ft. john mayer),"I'm writing you to. Catch you up on places I've been. To whom it may concern. I refuse to be another being on this earth. I'm breathing for a purpose.

And you could find interest. First off congratulations on the win. It's time for some change to commence. I gotta question for you man ,. From an African American stance. Are we expecting to much from your four year plan. And what about the rappers. That happen to act like a black president. Give us a right to be assholes. You know. They say your name for attention. But little to no interest after election. or the too cheap t-shirt sellers. That's making revenue of a name we cherish. As I end this letter. One more thing you understand your impact on our race.

You never had a son. As if it was a literal but ,. Years later there's still a bunch of little you's. Never seen you as lyrical. But more as a voice that the whole culture would listen to. Speakin the truth. Like only you can do. It's only right we lose greatness at its pinnacle. I got a question for ya. Little somethin to say. Are you still mad at Biggie ?. Are you still mad at Dre ?. And are you happy at the way your legacy portrayed ?. I'm trying to do for D.C what you did for L.A. But music today. It's getting lame for us. They chasing fame rather than making a change for us. They stop being artists. They stop being honest. They want that club shit. Ain't no more damn mama's. And you don't know me. But knowin you through music is going to change the world. In the future. Truly yours , Wale. P.S Hey how long will they mourn you forever in the day ?. I'm writing you to. Catch you up on places I've been. You have this letter. Finally got excited. But there's nothing else inside. So I'm writing you this letter. And I can only hope that you read it if you get it. Hoping if you get it that you won't ever forget it. You won't never forget it. You won't never forget it (x2). I'm writing you to. Catch you up on places I've been. You have this letter. Finally got excited. But there's nothing else inside. I'm writing you to.

lotus flower bomb (feat. miguel),"[Wale]. I'mma rap to you real quick. I wanna enjoy the luxury of like. Not knowing each other for real. Hol' up. [Intro: Miguel]. Lotus flower bomb, firefly. When I'm low, she take me high. I can teach you all the sounds of love. [Verse 1: Wale]. Flowerbomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance. And you got that bomb, huh, I'm tryna detonate you. No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile. Try to keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down. Try to keep your spirits up, lil vodka whatever. Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort. So I clap for her, she deserves an applause. Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton. Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like. She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike. Care to tell, I read your mind, she been on them dollars first. Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work. I can be your boyfriend be your nigga or a friend with perks. I'm just tryna work that huh, they just tryna work your nerves. I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine. I'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind. [Hook: Miguel]. We're living in a fantasy. I feel it when you dance with me. It's feeling like you need to be. My lady, my baby, yeah. Can't you see. I'm talking about eternity. Tell me would you care to be. My lady, my baby. [Verse 2: Wale]. Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind. This is not no Sandra Bull, but you're Potion #9. Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs. And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride. And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush. Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh. Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside. I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's. I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right. Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right. I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight. Easy baby you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine. Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?. Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups. I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right. With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name, it ain't important babe cuz I'mma call you Mine. [Hook: Miguel]. We're living in a fantasy. I feel it when you dance with me. It's feeling like you need to be. My lady, my baby, yeah. Can't you see. I'm talking about eternity. Tell me would you care to be. My lady, my baby. [Bridge: Miguel]. Cause I don’t know you, you don’t know me. The clock keeps ticking baby what's it gonna be. I don’t know you, you don’t know me. Let me teach you all the sounds of love. [Outro: Miguel]. Ahhhh, ayyyyy, eeeeee, ahh ohh ooo. Baby this was for you, lotus"
lovehate thing (feat. sam dew),"[Intro: Wale]. Shout out to Marvin Gaye. Love you then they hate you. Then they love you again. Hate you then they love you. Then they hate you again. [Hook: Sam Dew]. Hold me tight, let me go. Heal my heart, hurt my soul. Build me up, break me down. Make me smile, make me frown. Give me love, take it all away again. Give me love, take it all away again. [Verse 1: Wale]. Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me. Beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me. Son of a mother studying at UDC. Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets. Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean. On everything I wear it, all the America's tees. This whole system most prolific in the DMV. Listen when you get the keys to sell 'em, you don? t get the beef. Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace. You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me. PG to Mo County bet they all know about me. Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance. From the city that made me love you forever for it. Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it. You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not. They gon' love you a little different when you at the top. [Bridge x2: Wale]. Give me love, baby. Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby. What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby. This ain't right, this is life. This a love hate thing. [Hook: Sam Dew]. Hold me tight, let me go. Heal my heart, hurt my soul. Build me up, break me down. Make me smile, make me frown. Give me love, take it all away again. Give me love, take it all away again. [Verse 2: Wale]. Yeah, my affinty grows as the city gets cold. As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes. Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own. But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor. I'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul. Women in town, but I'm manifestating every goal. I see potential in John, talk to him once a week. Media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet. I lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead. When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?. Lord father if I opted to follow them. My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here. And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads. Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare. How could you blame us envy?. We do the same thing for a living. Know the same niggas, but they all commend me. Champagne I'mma spill it until we all fill up. Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions. And probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks. So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians. [Hook: Sam Dew]. Hold me tight, let me go. Heal my heart, hurt my soul. Build me up, break me down. Make me smile, make me frown. Give me love, take it all away again. Give me love, take it all away again"
m.i.a.,"[Verse 1 - Omarion]. My new lady says she leaving me. Ah fuck her I don't care. Plus I got another over there. She been wantin to be with me. Got her in her underwear. Gave her what she want, now she need me... I got more of that coming over soon. Lingerie all up in my room. I'mma make this toast to that one girl I love. I still smell her perfume. [Bridge]. Pour one up, no pour another (x3). Numbin' up. [Hook]. Since you've been away, love's been MIA. Done looking for love, cause you took away her. Now I'm MIA. Done looking for love, cause you took away her lvoe. [Verse 2 - Omarion]. My new lady says she leaving me. Ah fuck her I don't care. Told me that she loved me, yeah. I just give them the scenery, they won't ever compare. To the ones that still got it. I call her up but she won't answer. And she knows what I'm looking for. And she knows what I'm looking for. [Bridge + Hook]. [Wale]. Call me a rolling stone, missus. Still tryna deal with ya. Loving too much will leave you blue and I ain't pledge Sigma. I'm a real nigga. Giving feelings just ain't me. The more attention you give em. The more options they seek. Talk is cheap, knew I should've kept the receipt. She said she loyal, but all bitches gonna talk in the streets. That's how I play it, how I play it. All it is is game. As I hit another paper plane I'm MIA"
matrimony (feat. usher),"[Usher]. If there's a question of my heart, you've got it. It don't belong to anyone but you. If there's a question of my love, you've got it. Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you. Baby, I've been making plans, oh love. Baby, I've been making plans. Baby, I've been making plans. Baby, I've been making plans for you. My sincerest apologies, I mean it. I'll admit it, all being pathetic. I'm in my late 20s and still never been to a wedding. Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well. It's not your fault they try to get me, cause I'ma need to sail. Cause I'm selfish and I need you to myself. Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale. Cause I fell and see you bout to cry. Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride. And I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments. Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them. Wrong, how dare I (?) ignore them. Preparing for that day, I leave you here. And switch you for them. It's hard, you know temptation and all. Out here tryna see if my relationship's strong. Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart. Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more. I'm wrong. But I'm promisin' you better though. And your friends sayin' let him go. And we ain't gettin' any younger. I can give up now but I can promise you forever though. [Usher]. If there's a question of my heart, you've got it. It don't belong to anyone but you. If there's a question of my love, you've got it. Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you. Baby, I've been making plans, oh love. Baby, I've been making plans. Baby, I've been making plans. Baby, I've been making plans for you. I'll admit it, let me be hypothetic. The day I find a women I prolly be scared to share it. The idea of me finding love would run somebody off. And true my wall could use some plaques. But still I got the floors. Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost. Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move On's. And dark, troubled heart. Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart. This is hard, tryna find some time to move on. Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady she got too dark. Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong. My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long. Nah, good terms how that ended. But it surely put a dent in how I worry about this business. Off white picket fences, more flights with the children. On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions. But, I plan to do it better though. But you still sayin' let it go. We ain't gettin' any younger. Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though. [Usher]. If there's a question of my heart, you've got it. It don't belong to anyone but you. If there's a question of my love, you've got it. Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you. Baby, I've been making plans, oh love. Baby, I've been making plans. Baby, I've been making plans. Baby, I've been making plans for you"
miami nights,"The streets is cold and the beaches is warm. The bitches is everythin' in between. Who would believe this rap shit would have me well off. Type of life a nigga kill or go to jail for. Yeah, can't wait til the wheels down. And I'm amazed you clown niggas is still around. Smoking haze all over town like it's allowed. I like my women soft-spoken but the weed loud. Catchin' Heat, floor seats and we all fresh. From court seats to court seats is progress, of course. Tell them other niggas ""man up"". Tell Lebron drop fifty unless he playin' us. Kod a couple fifties like a precinct. Straight conch got a nigga feelin' seasick, oh shit. Chef Creole, two-seater. And my watch lookin' like it's all 3po. 2 V's in the street blowin' trees with hoes. And more weed for me, shout out to Meek P.O. Miami nights, it was all a dream. If I can get my money right, I'm about to Od. Little more weed, 1st class seats. First class hoes, we on South Beach. Miami nights, it was all a dream. If I can get my money right, I'm about to Od. Drinks out, c'mon. Drinks out, c'mon. Drinks out, c'mon. We at Mansion, but no cape on. And that ass lookin' right, what you pay for it. Look, I know you not gay or nothin'. But we should find another girl with a tapeworm. I'm in a rental on Collins. Me and my compadres, burning up Barneys. With a model and some ?. My name hold weight and you dont really keep the bar raised. With dark niggas with dark thoughts and long braids. Its not far from white girls with big bread. And light beers, they slight care, they spring breaking. But right there, they skill scheming, they not eating. Knowing they needy as a bitch, they don't need a reason. And when you reppin' Wet Willies, you ain't even thinkin'. Miami nights, it was all a dream. If I can get my money right, I'm about to Od. Little more weed, 1st class seats. First class hoes, we on South Beach. Miami nights, it was all a dream. If I can get my money right, I'm about to Od. Drinks out, c'mon. Drinks out, c'mon. Drinks out, c'mon. Ok black panamera, dash on a million. It ain't nothin' better than a passionate woman. She graduated top of the class, Carol City or was it the west. Hold up I dont remember really, hold up. Two whips, six tattoos, no kids. And I heard you come alive, when you gonna Liv. I ain't trying to be ignorant, but I'm leaving town in a little bit. Miami nights, ain't another one, until the buzz go away lets have a little fun. Paradise, get away, thinkin' why its not South Beach everyday. We got the jet waitin' on us at the airport homie. We got money to go get baby. Let's get it. Miami nights, it was all a dream. If I can get my money right, I'm about to Od. Little more weed, 1st class seats. First class hoes, we on South Beach. Miami nights, it was all a dream. If I can get my money right, I'm about to Od. Drinks out, c'mon. Drinks out, c'mon. Drinks out, c'mon"

Seen a bump in my sale cause of Forbes. Like oh, let 'em know that's how niggas go. from that ballin' to 30 for 30 broke. And I used to hear the stories of glory of servin' coke. But I was more concerned with the corners. and cover four. Politics give me stress, I got enough on my soul. Cause they don't tell me to pray. but they pray I don't need a vote.

Maybe it's cause of the way the she praise me. I ain't used to it, she got that hot love. I try to lay low, she like to pop up. I try to make the most of it, beat the box up. I make the pussy wet, make the heart bust. Good pipe make a good girl to a good wife. Good morning wood, I just need a termite. Riding thru my hood tryna see where I'm at. She can't be in my face, then she be on my back. Like, ""Where you at Wale?'. Or, ""Where is that Wale?', ""Who you with Wale?'. When I'm back, ""You the shit Wale"". She crazy, that stalker shit. Everyone of her homegirls so talkative. No time for that, no acknowledgement. Think its time you and I need to call it quits. Look, need to call it quits. You be on that stalker shit. Look I tried to call it quits. Til' she came trench coat and a thong and shit. Woah. [Hook:]. I'm like a masochist. So lead me to the wall. I'm yours to own, you know. Don't be a pacifist.

Temptation starting to sink in. As I indulge in an instinct I'm fadin'. I'm in love with a woman who crazy. Maybe it's because of the way she chase me. The more liquor around, the more I'm in love. The less clothes you, the less I want to talk. Maybe that throat she got have a nigga stuck. And I be putting it down, so she ain't giving up. She call a nigga too much cause she don't get enough. She never ready to go, so she forever come. I lick her up, she love it. I know I'm fucking up. I like it cause she a ten, but she say I'm the one. Like, ""Settle down, Wale."". Look, ""Right now, Wale."", ""I'm in love, Wale."". ""Guess I ain't nothing but a quick nut, Wale."". She crazy but I attract to it. All the insane bitches so passionate. What they lack in trust, they make up in lust. And it don't really make sense until the draws it off. She is far is all. I be leading her on. I be deeping her up, she said the D is a drug. Shawty fieining for love, I be feeding her lust. I be needing to leave, but I be needing to nut. Never need it enough. [Hook]. I'm like a masochist. So lead me to the wall.

I can show you what them blocks buy. I can tell you 'bout my block ties. I can take you to the far side. Poor decision makin', played you niggas lives. You sellin' crack up on your momma's porch. While she still goin' through her new divorce. He has a thrill as he raise his voice. When he really needs to raise his boys. Young thugs with so much talent. Young thugs havin' no balance. Young niggas havin' no fathers. Young niggas catchin' dope charges. Growin' up she say she felt alone. Now she strippin' for that pot of gold. Another fish in the bowl. They say her mother never played her role. I heard her mother always on the roll. Her mother always wearin' gold. Where I'm from I guess that's how it goes. [Hook 1: Rick Ross]. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Damn. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions.

Caught up in the game now. Look at how we came out like olly olly oxen free. That ain't why they watchin' me, yeah, yeah. Decided since like 4, 5 or sugar coated, colored edibles. Instead of buildin' up a habit in them vegetables. Now early 30s, my blood pressure's incredible. Medical, yeah nigga I'm tellin' you. Covered in cars over community. Rappers influence your shootin' sprees. Turn around like that ain't got shit to do with me. Easy to record so ruthlessly. Rich niggas. [Bridge: Rick Ross]. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. [Verse 3: Wale]. Can't tell you 'bout that H dude. But I'll tell you 'bout this hate dude. And I'll show you where they raise a tool. Have a nigga late for the labels or the latest shoes. I'm from an era where gold trinkets could buy attention. And the hoes thinking might blow your winky. for unknown emblem. Label whores that'll fuck a sale and suck a store. Left the pearl, dream of rose, but can't accord. A Ford, a Dodge, or afford.

poor decisions (feat. rick ross & lupe fiasco),"[Intro: Rick Ross]. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Damn… rich niggas makin' poor decisions. All my little homies up in prison. I'mma let you know just how I'm livin'. [Verse 1: Rick Ross]. I can tell you' bout the Mach Five. I can show you what them blocks buy. I can tell you 'bout my block ties. I can take you to the far side. Poor decision makin', played you niggas lives. You sellin' crack up on your momma's porch. While she still goin' through her new divorce. He has a thrill as he raise his voice. When he really needs to raise his boys. Young thugs with so much talent. Young thugs havin' no balance. Young niggas havin' no fathers. Young niggas catchin' dope charges. Growin' up she say she felt alone. Now she strippin' for that pot of gold. Another fish in the bowl. They say her mother never played her role. I heard her mother always on the roll. Her mother always wearin' gold. Where I'm from I guess that's how it goes. [Hook 1: Rick Ross]. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Damn… rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. All my little homies up in prison. Lupe gotta tell ‘em how you livin'. [Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]. The Beloved T-Rex says. Grown man bars is somethin' you gotta deal with. Whole hand cards but nothin' that you can build with. That sound like bullshit from out a bull mouth. Even the tepee is a full house. Simple shelter keep you out the cold. If you hold it close together, we'll never fold. Why you lettin' the devil beat you out your soul. You don't believe in God then at least believe in odds. This house of odds is just a house of cards. Just without the yards, and nice adjacent parks. We was born black but that shit'll make you dark. Even with a handful of hearts. Mind on the club just to find a little love, my regards. Cause when your P-O-V is poverty. It's like D-O-C a lottery, that D-O-C be lock and key. Finna D-O-P-E bob and weave. And the box… boxin' free. Up out them rings like it was Rocky 3. Caught up in the game now. Look at how we came out like olly olly oxen free. That ain't why they watchin' me, yeah, yeah. Decided since like 4, 5 or sugar coated, colored edibles. Instead of buildin' up a habit in them vegetables. Now early 30s, my blood pressure's incredible. Medical, yeah nigga I'm tellin' you. Covered in cars over community. Rappers influence your shootin' sprees. Turn around like that ain't got shit to do with me. Easy to record so ruthlessly. Rich niggas. [Bridge: Rick Ross]. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. [Verse 3: Wale]. Can't tell you 'bout that H dude. But I'll tell you 'bout this hate dude. And I'll show you where they raise a tool. Have a nigga late for the labels or the latest shoes. I'm from an era where gold trinkets could buy attention. And the hoes thinking might. Blow your winky for unknown emblem. Label whores that'll fuck a sale and suck a store. Left the pearl, dream of rose, but can't accord. A Ford, a Dodge, or afford. Where she end up on your knob. ‘Cause she has never been adored. Lord help us, my generation come to an end. Cause we all selfish, but livin' shallow, how we gon' swim?. I mean really why should I pretend?. Walkin' dead… my soul is possessed. I'm reppin' my set, no matter who posin' against. Once I got hot, they only good option to vent. [Bridge: Rick Ross]. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. Rich niggas makin' poor decisions. [Outro: Lupe Fiasco]. Aye Ricky I'mma flip the mission. How 'bout poor niggas makin' rich decisions?. Poor niggas makin' rich decisions. That shit right there is more efficient. Poor niggas makin' rich decisions. Can't afford ‘em but you still gon' get ‘em. Buyin' jewelry but you know you're vision. Yeah… On a mission. Yeah… Maybe, Part 2"

shades (feat. chrisette michele),"(Boy) Beautiful. (Boy) Beautiful. (Boy) Beautiful. (Boy) Beautiful. (Boy) Beautiful. (Boy) Beautiful. (Boy) Beautiful. Chip on my shoulder. Big enough to feed Cambodia. See, I never fit into they quotas. Sneakers wasn't fitting and my knees needed lotion. Long before I knew the significance of a comb. I roam like phone with no vocal reception. Immigrant parents had me feeling like a step-kid. And black Americans never did accept me. That's why I thrive so much, win and respect dig. I never fit in with them light skins. I felt the lighter they was the better that they life is. So I resented them and they resented me. Cheated on light-skinned Dominique. when we was seventeen. I figured I'd hurt her, she'd evidently hurt me. and all women who had light features. See, I never let a light broad hurt me. That's why I strike first and the first cut's deep. All my light skinned girls to my dark skin brothers. Shades doesn't matter heart makes the lover. Boy you're so beautiful. boy you're so beautiful shades. doesn't matter heart makes the lover. Boy (beautiful caramel). Boy (beautiful coffeepot). Boy (Beautiful chocolate). Boy (Beautiful toffee). Boy (Beautiful pecan). Boy (beautiful licorice). (boy you're so beautiful). Just another knotty head nigga. Hoping Wes Snipes make my life a bit different. In middle school, I had the right to be timid. I had beautiful words but girls never listened. Listen, blacker the berry, sweeter the product. Well, I'm fruit punch concentrate and they water. Walk into my room thinking how to make moves. Ain't thinking like a student but how Ice-T do it. Light dudes have the girls looking there all year. It's not fair, the ones with the good hair. Couldn't adapt to naps, I wavecap they naps. and slept on me. Man, I hate black. Skin tone, I wish I could take it back. Or rearrange my status, maybe if I was khaki. Associating light skin with classy. The menstrual show showed and me, that was not me. All my light skinned girls to my dark skin brothers. Shades doesn't matter heart makes the lover. Boy you're so beautiful. boy you're so beautiful shades doesn't matter. heart makes the lover. Boy (beautiful caramel). Boy (beautiful coffeepot). Boy (Beautiful chocolate). Boy (Beautiful toffee). Boy (Beautiful pecan). Boy (beautiful licorice). (boy you're so beautiful). They say black is beautiful. But ask them beautiful light girls. if its black they attract to usually. What if Barack skin was all black, truthfully?. Would he be a candidate or just a black in community?. Because black dudes tend to lack unity. And them blacker girls ain't on the tube, usually. Right now, at 23, I ain't mad at them reds no more. But for long time I had gone cold. Blindfolded my own insecurity. was holding me back to reds, I ain't know how to act. They would get the cold shoulder and know it was an act. A defense mechanism what I thought that I lacked. Confidence. All my light skinned girls to my dark skin brothers. Shades doesn't matter heart makes the lover. Boy you're so beautiful boy. you're so beautiful shades doesn't matter. heart makes the lover. Boy (beautiful caramel). Boy (beautiful coffeepot). Boy (Beautiful chocolate). Boy (Beautiful toffee). Boy (Beautiful pecan). Boy (beautiful licorice). (boy you're so beautiful)"

Trying to chase the cat, know I'm killing it dog. You ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof. [Hook 2: Jeremih & Wale]. You remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it. You something like my car. I got the keys to them, I need the keys to you. [Pre-Hook: Jeremih]. You put on a show, you don't need no clothes. Give me little bit more, always take it slow. I know you don't wanna stop, I'm trying to make it go. Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose. [Hook 1: Jeremih] (x2). [Verse 3: Wale]. A good woman is scarce to us. And I wasn't prepared to love. I know it sound crazy, but your miles scare me. I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told). A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told). You heard it all but hear this love. One night with dude, I be the reason you cool. So let me know am I clear enough, yeah wassup. Way I, way I, that's the way I think. Shawty straight like, a concert on [?] street. In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like. ""Tight, let's keep it Amg"". Sliding down, precipitating is straight. Top down, let me kiss your physique. I'm digging your flee, I'm checkin' your gear. Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet. She like when I drive it, I like it in park. Pull that thing over you likely to sore. I got her floating like riding on stars. So I keep it Gps, see where this going. Nothing will stop it, I slide in no prob. Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts. Sex is her weapon, my snake in her garden. So know when I'm not here the viper is on. [Pre-Hook] [Hook] (x2)"

the girls on drugs,"Hey! Happy festivus everyone!. I promise you ain't never really freak out until. You be out at freak hours and see each and. Every freak out from free couch to free couch. We go deep and we don't get no sleep. Cause we be up all night until the early light. Man these niggas ain't serious. Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?. I used to pop blues with my lil' bitch. I call her boo cuz her real one I will forget. I use a uber to scoop me to sls. What you expect, a little groupie to see my crib?. Oh no, these niggas ain't serious. Do you know what type of bitches I've been dealing with?. Try to tell me adderall make her get a rush. Used to use it to study until she fell in love. Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot. Told her ""nah you lying, cuz you don't eat enough"". Nah nah nah. These women ain't serious. She sprinkled a little something up in her lip. Start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched. Kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip. I'm trying to get me a real woman to take out. But for now, they're wild. They rather get it in. Girls on drugs. Girls on drugs. Girls on drugs. Pills and subs when them beers ain't enough. They still need love. In her purse where her hand go. She disperse by the handful. Coco make her go up. Nothing popping, pop a zan when she laying low. Bars to break, so many bars to break. She at the grammy's turnt, none of the stars is fake. She like ""oh my God, I'm on the moon and shit"". And my particular moon like a platoon and shit. You know the niggas I be dealing with. Politicians and niggas living it on the rip. And my position to give this shit to little kids. Is not official unless I'm giving them authentic. We're all living with small demons. We're all sinning, it's all similar. Broads with us and they bong hitting. Let me tell you about the bitches I've been chilling with. The really insecure ones look good as shit. Nothing fill the void of a little pill. A little shot, she ain't shy when the shit spill. And it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside. Beside that the lime light be so real. Let me tell you about the bitches that I kick it with. Told me nobody love her and so she cut her wrist. Not enough for the hospital but cut it close. That's why she want to get high because she's feeling low. Told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke. So I could numb her insides and we will never know"
the glass egg,"And they say don't ever change (change on me). Although beautiful matrimony is. A rapper balancing your women. Your riches and at least half your homies.

Talked to the times when younger. and made me get my life in order. Real in it for life, but now look at the price. But now look at that register, everything in here slight. MM, cause I'm john doing a hype. Look at how the moral of the story, but don't see its advice. It's right, it's like life is like a glass egg.

Look at you there's the contra kept the cold. but you got extra men. Told you I would get this straight, told you once I got big. It's lonely at the top by the population looking in, ahh. Then I got my deal. Started wondering if them peoples with me are for real. (Sometimes the mighty let the devil in). Yeah, now salutations to my former friends. Forming to form against me. is currently your form of defense. And now it hurts me to say, sometimes your sandbox. [?] Equipped for dirty exchange, now was it. [?] Or that bling in a hurt or sustain at curtain calls. One of two that either boo or bouquets, so was it. Worth of your fam or worth all tha fame.

[Wale:] We gon' call this ""The Intro About Nothing"". It's gon' go like this. Lord, my all, what you think of it?. Been on this long road accumulating luggage. As time proceeds, preoccupied with everything. I think it's 'bout that I sing of nothing. Sipping wine, sipping wine, cause my Henny finished. Hard to be friendly with women who've seen. too many niggas. So I keep my circle small, you need reduction. Never too much friends, what is your circumference?. I swear to God, times is hard, but they're getting better. Tryna enjoy every moment, but see we so competitive. Gubana made the level, and I never missed a supper. But still my hunger's like a fucking model at a buffet. I'm with these broads who in love, they ain't seen any better. But dollar signs never mind, and he keep a zero. And if my heart could speak, it would talk to freaks. And leave the room when a nigga try to sleep with 'em. Getting high, getting by, watching time fly. Tell my niggas, I'ma get 'em if they gon' ride. Young, wild nigga living the dream. Although I'm not who I'm destined to be. They keep saying, ""Grow up"". I pray my girl don't turn to my baby mother yet. But in fact I do, I need by boo to keep my shit in check. And shit get easier when dreams of chasing respect. Get realized, and ain't no team invading your set. Getting high, getting by as my mind fly. Just bought my homie a Roley simply to pass time. And on top it's lonely so keep your homies. right by your side. And if life is short then we'll be the shorts of the Fab Five. Severed ties with any nigga who covet mine. And all the stunting got me looking ugly in momma's eyes. But I gotta do it, these niggas need provocative music. And as a youth momma worked too much. to have an influence. Rapping and music, a bunch of bitches acting too foolish. You gotta be stupid, even Tim Allen had him a tooly. Getting high, sitting down, thinking out loud. It's a shame niggas lame, but I'mma hold it down. Let my bread roll, never let my friends go. That's why I let these dreads grow. I'll never fit your fucking crown. Getting high, getting by, watching time fly. Tell these niggas I'mma get 'em every other time. Young, wild niggas sit in your seat. Know every weekend every liquor for free. With chilly roller for leaf, nothing so silly, bitch. I sow what I reap. Double M Genius, make these bitches so deep. I make these niggas' opinion. on younger lyricists consistently weak. Put my cardio in the audio and you missin' the beat. I'm out, standing in every avenue, I'm good in the streets. Outstanding, shitting on niggas, but you sit when you pee. Hold up. I figure, they don't care nothing 'bout albums. So why not give 'em an album about. Hey, you better sing that shit, nigga. This how you start the motherfucking show. My fourth joint in a row.

Baby, I've been making plans for you. (My sincerest apologies, I mean it). Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic. That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding. Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well. It? s not your fault they try get me cause I'mma need the sales. Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself. Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel. Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry. Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride. I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments. Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them. Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?. Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them. It's hard, you know temptation and all. Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong. Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart. Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong. But I'm promisin' you better though. And your friends sayin', ""let him go"". And we ain't gettin' any younger. I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though. If there's a question of my heart, you've got it. It don't belong to anyone but you. If there's a question of my love, you've got it. Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you. Baby, I've been making plans, oh love. Baby, I've been making plans for you. Baby, I've been making plans. Baby, I've been making plans for you. (Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote. Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love). I? ll admit it, let me be hypothetic. The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it. The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off. And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss. Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost. Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move Ons. And dark, good nigga, troubled heart. Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart. This is hard, tryna find some time to move on. Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark. Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong. My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long. Nah, good terms how that ended. But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business. Off white picket fences, on flights with the children. On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but. But I plan to do it better though. But you still sayin' let it go. We ain't gettin' any younger. Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though. If there's a question of my heart, you've got it. It don't belong to anyone but you. If there's a question of my love, you've got it. Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you. Baby, I've been making plans, oh love. Baby, I've been making plans for you. Baby, I've been making plans. Baby, I've been making plans for you. We ain't nothin' but some planets"
the middle finger,"Now, one of the services you provide. is giving them something to talk about. Let 'em talk. It makes 'em happy, it makes 'em feel good. They don't believe half the shit they say. People wanna talk. Yeah, it's fun to talk. Hate to be the bearer of bad news. But I can't move with too many rap dudes. I respect dudes from my double m crew. But I'm just not that dude hanging on. to who's who's and such. Cash rule for some, got room for none. Can't fool with niggas who put the rumors up. Wanted to quit, rap music sucks. But couldn't run a 4. 2, so with you I'm stuck. Went in the booth, truth? The only tool I trust. And that's sayin' a lot, cause pro tools be stuck. You grindin' hot, they wanna be cool with yah. They're like consignment shops, they're old news to us. Society, I trip 'em. Aye well look now. I got to be the realest. Aye well look now. Society, I trip 'em. Aye well look now. Should follow no nigga. Just the God inside of my mirror. Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now). Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now). Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now). Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now). Fuck you, leave me alone. Fuck you, leave me alone. Fuck you, leave me alone. Fuck you, leave me alone. Fightin' for my respect, receive it or nothin' else. Preachin' and geekin', I kinda think that I'm malcolm x. Mdma in my juice, jaws tired and thru. Now I'm sweatin' cause the bitches, they perspired me to. Are you judgin' me now? Do you fuck with me now?. Miscarried my first child, ain't finna come out. Fuck the therapy route, where the syrup and loud?. Blue 30 come around, there's the smile. Opiated, could show up later with more elation. All my bitches say, ""take it easy, enjoy the paper"". Try to be with the people, see what I'm fightin'. Them inner demons, and how it was eatin' me. while I be in vegas. Yeah, life a gamble anyway jo. Pop a perc, I could merk through the pain though. Mind bills pilin' up, drop a single. Thrill's all gone when that mothafuckin' fame go. Ever seen a mix j cole and django?. Educated, shit, but he whip like he ain't though. Black bitches say my shit is so graceful. White bitches barely know me up in graystone"
the need to know,"[Intro: Jerry Seinfeld (Elaine Benes) ]. I guess maybe some little problems could arise. (There are always a few). If anything happened. and we couldn't be friends the way we are now. that would really be bad. (Devastating). Because this is very good. (And that would be good). That would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that. [Verse 1: Wale]. Tryna keep it low. Keep 'em on that need to know. Tell everybody that we're just friends. But to be honest that platonic shit's for Tv shows. Same place, we're with different folks. Case closed if they crack the code. Is it me, or is you cold?. Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes. Go put a sweater on or get a room. Forbidden fruit, swim in your juice. Lot of ways I can get to you. But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo. Pre- [Hook]. Still we keep it low. Keep 'em all on that need to know. Could somebody tell somebody. I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go. [Hook: Sza]. I'm not tryna pressure you. Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you. You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend. I just wanna know your name. And maybe some time. We can hook up. We can hang out, we can just chill. [Verse 2: Wale]. Tryna keep it low. Keep 'em all on that need to know. Tell 'em all that we're just cool. As far as me and you, we got a simple code. Spendin' nights, well that's optional. No telephones in the afternoon. I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'. Every time your ass in the mood. Sharin' thoughts when we share a room. Though we barely talk when we share a room. In the dark, still see your curves. Body like what, swear to God you're a miracle. Pre- [Hook]. Still we keep it low. Keep 'em all on that need to know. Could somebody tell somebody. I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go. [Hook: Sza]. I'm not tryna pressure you. Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you. You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend. I just wanna know your name. And maybe some time. We can hook up. We can hang out, we can just chill. [Interlude]. I mean let's say, what if we did?. (What if?). Is that like the end of the world or something?. (Certainly not!). Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while. if we want to?. (I know!). I mean really, what is the big deal?. We go in there, we're in there for a while. and then we come back out here. It's not complicated. (It's almost stupid if we didn't!). It's moronic. (Absurd!). [Hook: Sza]. I'm not tryna pressure you. Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you. You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend. I just wanna know your name. And maybe some time. We can hook up. We can hang out, we can just chill"

She gon' get you in your feelings. then get you out of your loot. Oh, she don't love you. She don't. She don't. She don't. She don't love you no more. [Jerry:] are you confident in the ""I love you"" return?. [George:] fifty-fifty. [Jerry:] cause if you don't get that return. That's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there. [George:] aw, I've just got to say it once. Everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?. [Elaine:] what, you never said it?. [George:] once, to a dog. H-town, what they do, yeah. I'm with j. Harden, I'm coolin'. And the way the broads are choosing us. I think I'm 'bout to move out houston. Nigga, got that black bottle on me. Black-black bottle on me. All the bs that I brought in here. Is on the ground, I know we'll od cause. I'm out h-town, just coolin'. My favorite bitch is ready, said ""what did you try and do? "". I told her ""it's whatever, "" she told me ""whatever"" too. She told me it's a problem, what's the problem?. ""The loot"". Yeah, she don't love you. She knows that I've been rolling up like a motherfucker. I've been pouring up like a motherfucker. Well, I've been creeping out like a motherfucker. Sleeping out like a motherfucker. Friends tell me I'm a motherfucker, they know. I've been rolling up like a motherfucker. They know that I've been creeping out like. A motherfucker, sleeping out like a motherfucker. Friends tell me I'm a motherfucker. yeah you know, you know. That body bang, need a body bag. Syrup in bottles, be balancing my anxiety, hey. I ain't sipping to fit in with niggas. I go to texas for women, and no timbaland weather. Mademoiselle, every nigga fetish for reals. Stay till the morning, my shit be snoring off with that pill. What a role model I be. I bet I lost respect when you saw me sweating off md. Ma, blame it on the batch, girl, it's ok. Pop one to relax, see, this rap shit is so fake. Women so fake, all these niggas so fake. So who am I to ask 'bout ass, titties or whole names?. Now she giving government and her number away. (She don't) hey. Meaning she wanna do things not for public display. (She don't) hey. I'm off a high and I'm losing my mind, in a daze, yeah. (She don't) uh. So won't you tell me you love me. while I'm stuck on this wave?"
the success,"The worst thing is when you get comfortable. That's why success is the enemy. Lord forgive us, we're sinners. Was poor with the other children. Of course the ills that are less fortunate. Support while they're killing. Graduated from school just to live on their knees. And wonder why the undergrads. don't wait for summer for heat. Cause a drug dealer's destiny's still reaching that key. Who are y'all to disagree. While everybody is looking for somethin'. Where the lookouts look out and be like. ""cuckoo, they comin'"". So it's nothin' when the income is nothin'. And the heat never be on so get that heat from the oven. It's humility, still humanized by these memories. You and I could never eye to eye. Cause my style's like 5 guillotines. I'm more head then cutting off 5 foreheads. 10 I seen, the tenacity of my swords edge. Boy... Been built for that. Seen blood get spilt for less. These young bloods like a bad drug. Can't find a cure, take a pill back. Uh, rah rah, d. c. Mean ""don't come"". A ""dick choke"" if your ho cum. That was told to me by curt bone. And that's fact, shout out wayne and corn too. I ain't slang in the 80's but. I feel the pain y'all went through. As a hustler's ""ambition"" continues. All them side ways niggas try and do you like bishop. And I'm sorry if you 30, still purchasing nickels. Cause I'm pushing 30 and the nickel be purchasing wizards. Like ""ted and zach, I got the bread, let's go and chat"". Man I made so much off of beanies we can go over cap. El captain of the rappers songs, get at me dog. And I'm christ' dior with a crispy cuff over paranorms. Stuntin', oh oh, I'm stuntin'. Ho-bo if there's shit in the bus scoop us a seven. Avenue livin', whats up. Revenue up the wazoo cause I hustle. Used to listen to wasalu. I so was ""kick, push""'ing the product out dtlr. Pardon me I'm just dwelling. Pursuing the exit from the cesspool we ascended. Uh tell me I ain't successful"
the white shoes,"[Skit]. I had a lady once stop me on the street. I was wearing white shoes. And she says, ""I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes. "" She says, ""It makes me feel good. "". . [Hook]. Take this good advice. If they're gonna judge you for life. Say we can't always be fly. We gon' be good long as them sneakers white. You'll be alright. Said you'll be alright. Said you'll be alright. Said you'll be alright. . [Verse 1]. Gucci S. Dots, whole hood had 'em. Ice cream 'fore the hypebeasts that's into fashion. Being forreal, yo try being Pharrell. When your black ass in a back class, the fronting was real. No Lauren London, we was on a budget. You know, sharin' Old Navy so the army could be fresh in public. Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money. Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin', 'bout how you're lookin'. When they love you for your status and your catalog. And everybody got a jersey to play along. Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos. So even dirty niggas had the foams. . [Hook]. . [Verse 2]. Biotech trainers on the way to work. And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk. That was the Pg Plaza manager, managin' us. Yeah I'm standin' in Lucky 7s but slingin' them Lugz. Still have them Js for the low, low, and I could get 'em early. But I'm not without a conscience, I see people out there hurtin'. Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store. And I think that was my shift, then again I'm not very sure. And that's a lot that can get to ya. When you're not sellin' drugs but the outcome is similar. Cause out come them niggas with pistols, tellin' you give 'em up. Now out come the moms with tissues cause you ain't give a fuck. Free lunch for everyone, income was very uh. On the second and 16th everyone would have every 1. And Reebok would carry pump, and that's not the scary part. These niggas love white shoes so much they'd be buried in them. . [Skit]. . [Bridge]. You'll be alright. You'll be alright. You'll be alright. You'll be alright. . [Hook]. . [Outro]. No matter how good or lavish us niggas got it. We just a bunch of ravenous addicts living for fancy haberdashery"
