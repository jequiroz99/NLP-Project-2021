Way back in the day before I had all of this paper. Before I had all of these diamonds,. before I had all of these haters. Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'. I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing. Always in a different state so now they label me a goner. I ain't come up out of nowhere. I'm from straight up off the corner. Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name. cause I been there. Now everywhere we go,. they said how much I spend when I'm in there. And I'm throwing up my money for the ones. who never made it. Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate. Now let's get medicated. Man, let's get medicated. Let's get medicated.

Middle finger we getting paid. It cost much but don't press that eight. That dotted line it ain't like that day. Comic book let me Illustrate.. Like power bang when they lift that cane. My cousin died wish I can get that day. Back like it's a vertebrae. Bring that nigga on front street. Talk about and never be about it. They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch me.

rolling papers 2,"Nigga, my motherfucker's life depends on this shit. Do this shit for my son. Turn me up. So I can hear myself a little more in the headphones. Came from the bottom, started this out with nothing. Turned the fam in my squad, and turn this thing into something. I grab a cone and I stuff it, never gonna get enough. Depending on how its going, we only gonna get tougher. I done seen people suffers, hate turned into love. Lost some people to get here. But they watching us from up above. On the road, hardly ever home. And money caught one in the dome. Now its hard to even pick up my phone. Leave me alone, I'll be in my zone. I'm getting grown but not too grown to let my family shown. Anything you want, you can get, you gotta build it tho. I blew up quick and lost some shit. But now I'm dealing those. There's consequences to every decisions.

How do you make a million dollars and stay same. How do you make a hundred millions and still sane. You got the money, the clothes, the cars, the girls. Trying to do better, but all the shit in the world. Something regular would you prefer?. But it's cool, it's too much pressure, you think you should curve. On the verge, packing up and going back to where I come from. Tired of these rappers, I only run in the lane once. Tired of all these girls, we all fucking the same one. I ain't giving chances no more, I already gave one. Getting money, you better save some. Don't be afraid to make mistakes cuz you gotta make some.

If you got a ounces of paper, you should burn it back. And if you ever do takes a loss, you can earn it back. Never slack, never overreact, let your money stack. Look at where you're going and where you at. You gon get there if you work hard. When you make it, you'll get exactly what you work for. I want more, couple cars in my garage. And mansions with marble floors. Above it all, open my doors. Couple plaques on the wall. Hoop court where my friends could ball. It may sounds strange but Imma need it all. When I spend some afar, I hit the road when I get the car. Got some family members that I don't see at all. It pays off cuz a man gon be a man and do what he gotta do.

Now I'm on but it still ain't what it seem. 'Cause now I got more money. More niggaz rather see me somewhere on the floor then the ceiling of this thing. But I can give a damn what a little nigga think. I pop more champagne, peel another sweet. Catch Wiz skinny ass chillin' on the beach. Cut my own hoes off, I ain't deal with them in weeks. I pray to God every night before I go to sleep. To let her know I'm safe, kiss my mother on the cheek. My little sister grown, little cousin tall as me. And I'm proud 'cause he ain't fuckin' round in the streets. The fans love the old school sound that I bring. You like jab-work, I pound on the beat. And bein' from Pittsburgh they sayin' they concerned. With tryna make a lame 'cause my sound is unique. I love when a nigga talk down, think it's sweet. You couldn't play me if you was acting and seeing. The haters can't see 'em, the money's in the way like traffic. Pistolvania is straight action. I'm from the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto). Where niggaz ain't workin jobs. They only option is to hustle. They feel like they gotta get it. Not all about it then fuck you. You ain't someone that I grew up with. So why you think I would trust you?. Real talk like a dictionary. They say life's a bitch, I'm married. And we make love, she fuck other niggaz tho. Can't keep up, you haters to slow, oh. Yea budy. That's how it is. That's it, that's all. Hahahaha, yea bitch. OK, hahaha"

Pretty much the rest of the time we here. My little niggas got more money than you fuck niggas man. I promise. [Hook]. I got-I got-I got-I got so much. So much, so much, so much. [Verse 1]. Quarter million, little nigga, I was nineteen. Had my hustle down pat, I did the right thing. They don't move that fast, they act like they don't like cheese. Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me. Is it cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be. Yeah my pockets hella straight. And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV. So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me. I don't even want it back, shit it's off to the good. Can't even say I didn't know you would. Make a little money, get it from the bro.

I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'. Ain't no way they spend how much they say. cause they just bluffin'. I got so much. [Verse 2]. Big money. Even larger crib. No I ain't just stuntin'. That's how I'm supposed to live. I move fast paced. So I drive faster cars. Take a look outside. Those are really ours. And we're really stars. We all travel safe and go really far. In that custom paint, in that suede floor. In that California, that's really hard. In that California, that's what we on. Smell that strong, you know I'm baked.

Gin in my cup, twenty two cones I'mma stuff. Lightin' another one up, cause. [Hook]. [Outro]. Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys. Step up your game or step down. Whenever a problem troubles us all. If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow. For there's nothing too much for the great God to do. And all that he asks and expects of you. Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield. Confidence and knowledge that God knows best. And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test. But without God testin' of our soul. It never could reach the ultimate goal. So keep on knowing and believing. All that God has promised you would be yours to receive. Preach, Church, tabernacle. Wiz! Wiz! That's the way. Wiz! Wiz! That's the way. Wiz! Wiz! That's the way"

brainstorm,"I'm cool with the new me. Some niggas told me they wish I'd. Go back to the old me. But don't even know me!. Cause I be on some rich nigga shit. Guess they comfortable with the broke me. Y'all flow by the oz. But you knew that and all you niggas knew this jack. And now you muthafuckas owe me. Some people ask why I be low-key. Guess I'm too real for me to act. Like I'm your homie. A lot of niggas try to get involved. When they see you make it on your own. Hear they songs, but they not as real. Cause when you got it all, something's gotta give. And we ain't talking if it's not about a dollar bill. I got so many things running through my mind.... Just drink and smoke, wanna flow, unwind.... Amazed how I get so much paper?. I'm more amazed how you could be such a hater!. Getting my lemonade squeezed fresh. No refrigerator touching my shit. Private island, waiter chef-made. Wanna ride jet skis all day. Come home to bed already made for us. Niggas who's winning like it's the kind of name for us. Fucking champions cause we run the game, forrest"
bright lights bigger city,"I been livin' for the weekend. But no not anymore. Cuz here comes that familiar feelin. That friday's famous for. Yeah I'm lookin for some action.

Now Friday's cool. But there's somethin about Saturday night. You can't say what you won't do. Cuz you know that you just might. I'm alive this evening. It was love at first sight. This Saturday. And every Saturday for the rest of my life. And everyone's standin in line. Yeah lookin good and lookin for a real good time. So I'll never have to wonder if. I'll have someone to share all of this with. And it's alright. It's alright (x5). Bright lights and the big city. It belongs to us tonight. Hear the nightlife when it's callin'. So we drinkin' till we fallin'. Ain't a Laker, but I'm ballin'. Meet about three girls and I brought these girls to the club. Can I get 'em all in?. Make a movie and let em star in it. Get drunk... in my car. Do the same thing in the morning. but we ignore them. Which one wanna go?. Roll in this Green, the one on the low. Champagne, meet broads on the flo'. We got bread, so we toast. To the life and the fact that we're major. Not to mention we're tailored. Been in the game, player. What up next, ya'll. And it's alright. It's alright (x5). Bright lights and the big city. It belongs to us tonight. Alright"
bts,"My momma ain't raise no fool nigga. Matter of fact, maybe she did. My momma raised a fool (haha). But that don't mean we can't get rich. Too rich (too rich). That's what they say. Humble beginnings. Rich ass endings. Pockets on swole. Big ass bingies. Started off losin'. Man it wasn't choosin'. Stuck with my nigga's. Now we all winnin'. Rollin' up paper. Ball like a Laker. Top on the building. I'm high as a 'scraper. What can I say now. Cops know my name now. No time to play round. I'm rich and I'm paid now. Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds. Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now. Try not to fade now. Try to find a way out. Nobodies innocent nigga. Get down or lay down. Made so much money but look how I'd paid out. Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house. Guess all these diamonds on my wrist. What u blinkin' about. It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about. [Hook:]. Try to be the best that I can. They got the right decisions, handle it like a man. You know I try to do shit with my heart. They talk but I don't listen. I just finish what I start. You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't. They got the right decisions, handle business like a man. You know I try when people say I should change. Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same. Nigga's still hating. Critics still weighting. Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases. But never said I'd stop counting these faces. Flyin' new places. Buying them cases. Nigga's want problems. I don't entertain it. Cause if it's real problems. It's not entertainment. I'm rollin' a joint up. Precise like a painter. The grind is what made us. The grind is what made us. Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer. Too much turnin' up. The club owners tryin' to censor. Tatted everywhere my full body full of scriptures. Pull up in the phantom. Paparazzi takin' pictures. Sellin' so much swag. We should be your swag vender. Big winner in the club, big cash spender. Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher. Some shit you can't witness. My nigga we been business. [Hook:]. Try to be the best that I can. They got the right decisions, handle business like a man. You know I try to do shit with my heart. They talk but I don't listen. I just finish what I start. You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't. They got the right decisions, handle business like a man. You know I try when people say I should change. Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same. . |. |. |"

May be a game to you, probably. That's a way of life for me. And so it's only right for me. Annihilate 'em if they in my way or sight. Keep 'em up off of me, a weakness. In you only make an appetite. Anytime I get into it I be looking. At them, looking pitiful. And their condition it be critical. Nothing less than original. Cross me once that's the end of you - who's next?"

Just strip for me without the tease, give me more. Still rockin golden eye on the nintendo 64. Sayin they don't make 'em like this anymore. Same goes for my whip, same goes for my kicks, rare. And I don't rush to the store, they save me a pair. Yeah, a nigga livin in the air. Spending more time in the clouds then I spend on the ground. Do the opposite, fuck takin advice from these clowns. Thats why I mash the gas when they tell me slow down. Yeaaa. (chorus). No matter which way I go, they tell me don't take that road. But I never put my foot on the brake oh no,.

Money game, money straight. Like Joe Key and Noah had. That's no bullshit, game time. Make you niggas change minds. Forfeit, or consume a full clip. Nigga like me eatin' small fish. With your bitch watchin' Swordfish. Niggas can't ignore this. You can't afford this - extravagant shit. We Louie Gucci Birkin baggin' this shit. Bag of the piff. Hot-boxin' in the back of the six. With Jimi Hendrix on, Immaculate shit. Long way from Compton. Where we used to bag it in shifts with mags and the clips. Hurricane, right back on the shit. Back on the block with a package of spliffs. From blowin' cats, it's the Wiz, what it is. [Hook]. And the kush became so strong. And the flights became private. And the bread became so long. Fast money and fly whips. We high, don't stop the smoke. And we fly G5, we so far from coach. Now you see why, when we high, can't stop the smoke. And we fly G5, we so far from coach. [Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]. Uh, you niggas want kush? We got ounces. Corgies we got pounds, clips we got rounds. Hundred thousand dollars when I skip through your town. Baller shit, don't even want a piece, man, we want all of it. Thirty thousand on the piece where my collar sit. Went so hard in the middle,. East don't know what to call this shit. Now I'm buyin' up all the champagne. Drinkin' away all of my problems, bitch. Might sound crazy. But I just left the private plane, promoter paid 100k. And I ain't even stay the whole day. Hit the crib, bought a pound and smoked the whole thing. That Givency Men's collection, copped the whole thing. Not to mention all these diamonds in my gold ring. Made it to the top with nobody knowin'. Niggas say they safe, but nobody's showin'. Man he beats this shit, but nobody flowin'. Old Versace shit, the newest Rick Owens. If I'm rollin' it, you know that it's potent. With the Game and we smokin'. [Hook]. And the kush became so strong. And the flights became private. And the bread became so long. Fast money and fly whips. We high, don't stop the smoke. And we fly G5, we so far from coach. Now you see why, when we high, can't stop the smoke. And we fly G5, we so far from coach. [Verse 3: Stat Quo]. Hah, it's self-explanatory how we get it. Roll the purp in a plane ticket. Stat hop to that money, but I don't ribbit. Post playa ball, nice in the pivot,. Jays on but I fuck with Pippin. Kays on when them niggas trippin'. Uh, pools of your partner blood, ya boy stay slippin'. Never tippin', stay sippin'. Court side, Blake Griffin. Stay missin', stackin' fitted while you niggas stay bitchin'. Coka and Boca, the kush of them strokers. Grand daddy and oova, blow that smoke to Jehovah. Four-fifty my motor, use your bitch for my chauffeur. I encoded the cobra, mark priced the Rover. T-top in the Trans, hit the gas and it's over. Bitch please, this is how we get them hoes the doja. I got shooters, I know growers from Vancouver. Plus I'm cooler than the cooler at your grandmomma's picnic. Bitch you?. Somethin' chill from Brazil, on the L. With Wiz and Game, my life is like Corona commercials. Family matters, Kevin Love at you Urkles. That's them wolves, niggas. They here to reverse birth you. Murk you, lights out no curfew. Bitch ain't stoppin' 'till my unborn seed's seed is rich. Or 'till Jesus sit right next to me and smoke. 'till the seasons switch, my nigga. [Hook]. And the kush became so strong. And the flights became private. And the bread became so long. Fast money and fly whips. We high, don't stop the smoke. And we fly G5, we so far from coach. Now you see why, when we high, can't stop the smoke. And we fly G5, we so far from coach"
fly solo,"[Chorus]. I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me. I woke up and wasn't no one there, yeah eh eaah. Same song to a different beat. Cause sometimes I feels like I'm the only one there. I guess nobody cares, hey. But everything's good until it goes bad. And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have. It hurts when it don't last. No easy way saying bye. So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky. And I fly solo. I fly solo. And I fly solo. And I fly solo And I.... [Verse 1]. I'm tired of being tired. And dealing with your BS,. All the while supplying. The money for your request. Without me you're a dime. But with me you're a buck fifty, haha. I can get another one quickly. But I'd rather wade it out. Take the broken pieces try and fix it. Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision. And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit. Ha. [Chorus]. I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me. I woke up and wasn't no one there, yeah eh eaah.

Now you're off the set. And I'm a let you see the show go on without you. Take a bow... think about it. And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it. See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes. The story of my life, you're just another page,. [Chorus]. But everythings good until it goes bad. And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have. It hurts when it don't last. No easy way saying bye. So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky. And I fly solo. I fly solo. And I fly solo. And I fly solo. And I.... [Outro]. I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me (staring at me). I woke up and wasn't no one there (no one there) Yeah eh eaah"
fly you,"[Intro - Wiz Khalifa]. Yeah! All this Louis Vuitton. I see clearly now, hahahaha. Ocean view, you deserve it. I do this for you. [Verso 1]. Say the trees couldn’t get better. Need this sort of weather. Sand beneath your toes, your drinks come with umbrellas. Cutting off our phones, ignoring important texts and email messages. Say I do it big, I can’t do it less than this. Them other n-ggas talking shit. You ain’t impressed with them. Yet to spend and we been up for a minute. That explains all the trips I invested in. It’s funny how all the fussing and fighting. Turned around into us f-cking and flying. Every night on the road you call me up and you crying. Was worried about them bitches. Now you too busy picking diamonds. And don’t worry ’bout a price. Cause if you want it I got it and I’mma pay for it. The good weed’s lit, the champagne’s poured. Order whatever you want if you got a taste for it. It’s every girl’s dream, but you awake for it.

And you know how it goes. I go harder than a bitch – pardon my French. But I go hard for this. You never had to see me on the starving artist shit. But mama when you caught me cheating. thought that you would call it quits. Knew f-cking with me that you was taking all the risks. So you ain’t try to give in. Saying I’ll be straight and you’ll be the one hurt in the end. And that’s no good!. Just tryna put you on the game like a coach would. Everything going just how it should, now your friends jealous. They hating on us but we so far they can’t tell us. The life we living it was made for us. When you’re ready, give me a call and I’ll be waiting on it. All you gotta do is hit me when you land. And I’ll pick you up from the airport. And take you straight to the villa, we don’t stay at resorts. 5-star suites, spend weeks at the day spa. Mama keep your day job, I’mma... [Refrão]. Fly you to where I am. I-I-I’ll fly you!. Fly you to where I am. I-I-I’ll fly you!. Fly you to where I am. I-I-I’ll fly you!. Fly you to where I am. I-I-I’ll fly you!. [Verso 3]. And no matter where we go,. you say you never been. She in love, cause I keep it G. Not cause the G’s that I spend. But I do spend G’s on expensive weed. Vintage sneaks and hotel room keys. Came for a date, spend a whole week. Red-eye, no sleep – window seat. [Refão]. Fly you to where I am. I-I-I’ll fly you!. Fly you to where I am. I-I-I’ll fly you!. Fly you to where I am. I-I-I’ll fly you!. Fly you to where I am. I-I-I’ll fly you!"

On popping champagne and tipping waitresses. G’d up, what you think this is?. Put your feet up, this the fast, life mama speed up. Pop the cork, roll the weed up. Nowadays ain’t fucking with the bar. Still aint nothing changed but the horses in my car. Usually ain’t into showing hoes where I live. But tonight we gon’ go to my crib. Be on your toes, your boyfriend smell that weed on your clothes. He don’t know what I did, drop you off at your whip. Work by 8, almost 6, plus your nigga calling. Think he starting to catch wind. Look at your phone, press end. Can’t hurt him with what he doesn’t know. Plus you figure we’re both grown, come on. [refrão]. Money ain’t a thang. Tell the waitress call and bring a bottle for every n-gga that’s here with me. That’s the kinda G-Shit I’m on. G-Shit I’m on, G-Shit I’m on. Got niggas rolling weed. Bitches with their hands in the air. Tell the DJ damn that’s my song. I ain’t trying fall in love with you. Let me fill your cup then find our way home. [verso 2]. High off the life I’m living. Rooftop you gonna need binocular vision. Order a few shots and them things that you say you do not do. You probably gonna give in. Say it’s wrong, I call it a statement for the mission. To get you high as you want, break dress code. Skip the line to the front. Ride top down, fire the skunk, soon as the dooby get down. Roll another one. Called and said theres a couple of you, bring my brother one. The bitches can’t roll weed, I ain’t fucking with them. That’s just real shit, spend Vegas chips, all expense paid trips. Buy the champagne and spill it, we don’t save a sip. And you here with me in VIP taking risk. Home girl saying shit like “Rose my favorite”. Plus I’m rolling up all this weed you ever smell. Weed in your hair, weed in your nail, she under a spell. [Chorus x2]. Money ain’t a thang. Tell the waitress call and bring a bottle for every n-gga that’s here with me. That’s the kinda G-Shit I’m on. G-Shit I’m on, G-Shit I’m on. Got n-ggas rolling weed.

go hard or go home (feat. iggy azalea),"I feel like the sky is falling down. Ain't nobody here to play around. Push it to the edge, I won't back down. Cause it's time to go hard or go home. One way up, no way out. I give it all, all for the family. We stay up, no bail outs. Give it all, all for the family. Five, four, three, two, I got one shot. You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop. New work, top drop. I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop. And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out. And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not. It's love and loyalty until my heart lock. Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out. I said it once, I'll do it again. I'm playin' the game, I do it to win. With you and your friend, that's thick and thin. That's me and my team, you know we gon' win. You know we gon' ball. You know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off. You know we gon' stick to the course. We ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all. I feel like the sky is falling down. Ain't nobody here to play around.

Pressure make a diamond, that pressure make me a star. Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar. People always askin' me how I got this far. My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are. Now they call me Mrs. Money. Like I'm married to the mula. Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers. Glory, hallelujah, I'mma take that ass to church. I'mma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work. I feel like the sky is falling down. Ain't nobody here to play around. Push it to the edge, I won't back down. Cause it's time to go hard or go home. One way up, no way out. I give it all, all for the family. We stay up, no bail outs. Give it all, all for the family.

Gotta keep it in my system. 60 box of Cigarellos. 'Cause I blow it by the onion. Pack up some dollar bills. Send some paper to my younging. 'Cause he just like Steve Francis. He be playing with them rockets. Whipping on the wheel. Got my peddle to the medal. 'Bout to hit another city. Ain't no point of getting settled. Straight onto the plane. Ain't been home in so long. You think it's my cologne. But it's money that you smelling. Eyes like my father. Can't stand my older brother. Got some niggas doing years. 'Cause of funny niggas telling. Nigga, I'ma be grinding. Till the day that I expire. I've been running through the batch. Till I'm the last man standing. Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard. Go hard or I'ma go home. I haven't been there you know in so long. So goodbye. Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard. Go hard or I'ma go home. I haven't been there you know in so long. So goodbye"

I'll just be an other cool kid that you passed on. And no matter how hard i fell. Played the best way i can with the cards i'm delt. For the day i can say its nice to meet you. Wait till next time i see you, ima say. Hey girl whats your name. I'm very very glad you came. Your such a beautifull thing. Hey girl whats your sign. I'm very very glad you took the time. Your such a beautiful thing. Hey girl are we compatible. I like tarantino flicks and a long talks, I'm a vergo. Theres so much that i think and don't get to say. (about you, its all about you baby). Hey girl its been a month or so. And i've been on the road singing songs flyin solo. When i go to sleep. Your the girl in my dreams. So i got your picture on my mac book screen. Savor somethin about this age your just like me. Shorty got flavor like my favorite ice cream. And ima scoop her one day and make her life change. Till then I'm like dang. And no matter how hard i fell. Play the best way i can with the cards i'm delt. For the day i can say its nice to meet you. Wait till next time i see you, ima say. Hey girl whats your name. I'm very very glad you came. Your such a beautifull thing. Hey girl what you say. I'm very very glad you took the time. Your such a beautiful thing. (x4)"

hope (feat. ty dolla $ign),"Way before your time the world knew this would happen. Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you. As you were brought into this world. You tried to find out about your surroundings. The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air. The smiles you see at that point are the ones. You should always remember. Authentic is. Due to the choices you make for yourself. It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget. But some although not healthy for them will create an understanding of what the word real means.

house in the hills (feat. curren$y),"[Wiz Khalifa]. Got no time for the conversations or funny shit. Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with. Used to turn on the Tv, see what I want. And now the same one I dreamed about. The same one I'm stuntin' in. In the 6-2, almost 26. And every nigga that I'm with got a zip. I look at this shit as one big table and best. Believe every nigga I'm with got a sit. They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us. Then sell it straight to the public. You young, black, then you thuggin'. What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'. Who stuck to what he believed in. And turned himself to something great. They should use that story to motivate. But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead. Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived. 25 and not dead. I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real. When you work hard to get it that's how you feel. The man that start what they knew and they ain't away. We started small to them houses in the hills. To them houses in the hills. Houses in the hills. Houses in the hills. To them houses in them hills. You make a little money, take care and right yourself. And people start coming up with they hand out. People take their stresses and make them yours. Well that's just what comes with being a man. I try to do all that I can to make sure that. My son grow up without having. To see half of the stuff I've been through. But in life we all got our own path. Don't understand that by now you won't begin to. Cop another Rollex or Porsche try and get even with me. Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me. Cause we had so many cars it was stupid. So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me. Made a couple million and fast too. They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom. Or how to make your people better. By taking knowledge and spreadin' it. Not being in the game but ahead of it. I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real. When you work hard to get it that's how you feel. The man that start what they knew and they ain't away. We started small to them houses in the hills. To them houses in the hills. Houses in the hills. Houses in the hills. To them houses in them hills. [Curren$y]. Thousand dollar benefit plates. No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place. Now I'm high, Empire State. Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace. I'm one of them under-celebrated greats. Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me. Soon as I stepped off the plane. Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine. Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne. I been in the crib enjoying my hobbies. Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me. Try me. Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy. I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran. Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in. Come out with the whole hen. A dollar and a dream. Have a house on the hill and the world on a screen. I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real. When you work hard to get it that's how you feel. The man that start what they knew and they ain't away. We started small to them houses in the hills. To them houses in the hills. Houses in the hills. Houses in the hills. To them houses in them hills"

Niggas smoking that beverage weed. I be on that light green. Pop molly in the after hours. A member of no sleep team. Get a whole pound smoke it by myself. Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps. [Chevy Woods]. You know I'm fresh up out that corner, twisting marijuana. They copy us, they clone us. Yeah we so fly we on us. Got acting like they been before. But they ain't never been at all. 8 balls I was in no hole. Ain't have time to fuck with y'all. Champagne when we celebrate. Keen sense so I smell the hate. Middle finger we getting paid. It cost much but don't press that eight. That dotted line it ain't like that day. Comic book let me Illustrate.. Like power bang when they lift that cane. My cousin died wish I can get that day. Back like it's a vertebrae. Bring that nigga on front street. Talk about and never be about it. They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch me. So anything you need you know that's on me. And that's OG, I swear homie. [Wiz Khalifa]. Now let's get medicated. Man, let's get medicated. Let's get medicated. Man I'm hella faded. Man, let's get medicated. Let's get medicated. Let's get medicated. Man I'm hella faded. I'm hella faded. Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique. My city holding on to me so niggers holding on their heat. Throwing up their side rolling up that leaf. Ondoers get high all we want is peace. Always on the grind that's every day so police looking. I'm just rapping killing beats tryin' to stay away from booking. Yeah my nigga dirty crocked I just had to make it on. And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home. Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'. I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing. Always in a different state so now they label me a goner. I ain't come up out of nowhere. I'm from straight up off the corner. Now everywhere we go,. they probably know my name cause I been there. Now everywhere we go,. they said how much I spend when I'm in there. And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it. Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate. Now let's get medicated. Man, let's get medicated. Let's get medicated. Man I'm hella faded. Man, let's get medicated. Let's get medicated. Let's get medicated. Man I'm hella faded. I'm hella faded"

If you know me, you know I'm bout my bread. I count a hundred million dollars 'fore I go to bed. I'm smoking OG, I'm drinking champagne. I'm standing on the couch, just throwing up my damn gang. I'm out in A town, 'bout to go to Mansion. My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action. I'm in my old school, my niggas ridin new. I'm in the Fountain Bleu like what you tryin' to do. I brought the whole thing so that's what I'mma smoke. I spent the whole thing, I'm never going broke. I'm rocking gold chains, I'm drinking til I croak. Smokin' 'til I choke, my watch need a vote.

I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid. I be overseas, I be in LA. I be in New York, I be MIA. [Verso 2: Juicy J]. On vacation weed in rotation. Relaxation, trippy nation. Chasing bands, model chicks. Look like Sports Illustrated. I'm getting high as a plane. With no final destination. On that gin, on that Hen. And that lean intoxication. Rocking dollars, rocking gold. Money tall like Manute Bol. In a presidential suite. With some playmates in a fold. Niggas out here chasing ass. When they should be chasing cash. I be smoking til it's gone. Juicy J don't waste no gas. With her legs lift up. I thought it was a stick up. Should've seen them hoes that pick up. Bands hard to lift up. Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee. They call me the money tree. All these bands on me, I can throw a jamboree. [Refrão x2]. I be overseas, I be in L. A. I be in the South, trappin' hard all day. I'm from Pittsburgh, but I be in the Bay. I be in New York, I be MIA. I be in Chi-town where they quick to spray. I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid. I be overseas, I be in LA. I be in New York, I be MIA. [Outro]. You already know what it is Nigga. It's that Cabin Fever 2. Shout out to everybody who got the first Cabin Fever. If you're listening to this right now. You're probably on the 2050 tour wit us. So welcome to that. It's TGOD man, we smoke footlong joints. Nothin' but KK and cookies all day. Pittsburgh in this bitch.

There's something I can spend some money too. ... but I'm out here patient, I just live my life. That shit you niggas trying to do. I guarantee I did it twice. They say life's a gamble, hit my joint and roll the dice. When you living this high, you can't be afraid of heights. Book my flight to vegas well, 20 thousand state a night. Another 10 on champagne, my money long I pay the price. Tired of niggas saying they get my game cause dawg. we ain't alike. I'm throwing money, when I walk up in this bitch,. they know it's money. Money in my arms, all the tables full of money. Pockets full of ... I roll. Dropping ... on my clothes. Balling super hard, smoking till I over dose. Hardly ever solve a bitch, we party till it's over. When the sun come up I'm spending money. There's something I can spend some money too. When the sun come up I'm spending money. There's something I can spend some money too. Niggas sayin you talking bout I'm balling too. Get your money up and quit your hating's what you oughta do. I been going hard since I was younger. Now it's in my teens I knew when I got older. I'll be on some now I do my things. Spending money, popping hella bottles, making niggas mad. Going places rolling jayz, I live the life you wish you had. Going up dollar bills... on my tag. Got a clip full of them og's. Trippy nigga hit the club, you know I be fucked up. Chasing all the model chicks, trying to get my fucks up. Niggas handcuffing hoes, but them niggas know what's up. Y'all came to the club together, but that hoe gonna leave with us.

I been walking round chest out like some D cups. Ole g puff say you got it locked and we found out its the key stuck. Used to fuckin with that cheap stuff. I show you rosee bottles of that cleeko. Than we drink till we fall. And when you wake up and realize what you did. It'll be me that you call. But i'll be on a plane. And even though we had fun. Shit i don't know your name. [Refrão]. Say i'm on my way but i don't know where i'm going. Been gone so many days don't know my way back home. Now i'm starin at this window. And i see my life in aerial so.

purple flowers,"(Intro). Wrapped in the warmth of you, loving every breathe of you. Feel my heart this moment, Ooohhh. [Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]. Notebook, Notebook. Trapper keeper paper. Willy Wonka's in my closet, all these flavors. Shop with me you'll get exhausted. Broke nigga's they got a Dodge. They just can't afford it, yellow star ships. Walking out the men's department. Now look at that bitch riding with me, ain't she gorgeous. You 747, I'm G4'in, snoring. Paper like the NBA, balling. No look, big house, own cook. My chick exotic, bring what I want through. And I don't even tell them what I want. I just throw pool party's in my hotel room, and they come. Didn't know I'm famous, so she claim she ain't a groupie. You feed her McDonald's, I'm the kind like eating sushi. Got a lot of loose leaf (paper). Come down to that money, Boy I'm straight, no chaser, okay. [Hook: Rick Ross]. I'm burning purple flowers. It's burning my chest. I bury the most cash, and burning the rest [4x]. [Verse 2: Drake]. Tryna get the green, like I'm waiting at a long light. Broke just doesn't suit me girl, and every night is prom night. Where'd I put my bow tie, millionaire multi. Rest in peace to B.I.G, and praises to the most high. Getting stupid paid, off of smart decisions. I'm the man now, I guess that parts a giving. Someone please tell me the problem, with my competition. I ask, ""What's up?"", and they just always say, ""The cost to living"". I learn from it though, I been down, and I got up. Bring a hundred thousand to the club, and light yo' spot up. And me fallin' and landin' in love, I don't think should happen. Because everything easier to get into, than to get out of. But someone show me to the owner of this city. Cause the owner's always seen to be the only people with me. I'm still the mafa, I still run the committee. NY forever, nigga's Diddy (somebody remind me where I am). [Hook: Rick Ross]. I'm burning purple flowers. It's burning my chest. I bury the most cash, and burning the rest"

What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em. Pack my bags look. like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning. If the flight is private, we probably should board it. You see it you like it, I can probably afford it. If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing. You picked a crazy time to start letting me know. Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches. Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show. Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow.

rolling papers 2,"Nigga, my motherfucker's life depends on this shit. Do this shit for my son. Turn me up. So I can hear myself a little more in the headphones. Came from the bottom, started this out with nothing. Turned the fam in my squad, and turn this thing into something. I grab a cone and I stuff it, never gonna get enough. Depending on how its going, we only gonna get tougher. I done seen people suffers, hate turned into love. Lost some people to get here. But they watching us from up above. On the road, hardly ever home. And money caught one in the dome. Now its hard to even pick up my phone. Leave me alone, I'll be in my zone. I'm getting grown but not too grown to let my family shown. Anything you want, you can get, you gotta build it tho. I blew up quick and lost some shit. But now I'm dealing those. There's consequences to every decisions. Could be wrong, just do the best with time you're given [?] strong. Give your all 'cause a man gon' be a man. And do what he gotta do. Baby, this is rolling papers two. (This is rolling papers two). (This is rolling papers two). Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it. When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it. (Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it. When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it). Yeah, all of the fame just comes with the game. It's a gift and the curse when everybody know your name. How do you make a million dollars and stay same. How do you make a hundred millions and still sane. You got the money, the clothes, the cars, the girls. Trying to do better, but all the shit in the world. Something regular would you prefer?. But it's cool, it's too much pressure, you think you should curve. On the verge, packing up and going back to where I come from. Tired of these rappers, I only run in the lane once. Tired of all these girls, we all fucking the same one. I ain't giving chances no more, I already gave one. Getting money, you better save some. Don't be afraid to make mistakes cuz you gotta make some. It takes time, but a man gon be a man and do what he gotta do. Baby, this is rolling papers two. (This is rolling papers two). (This is rolling papers two). Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it. When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it. (Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it. When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it). No turning back, I'm learning that. If you ever show someone love, you deseves it back. If you got a ounces of paper, you should burn it back. And if you ever do takes a loss, you can earn it back. Never slack, never overreact, let your money stack. Look at where you're going and where you at. You gon get there if you work hard. When you make it, you'll get exactly what you work for. I want more, couple cars in my garage. And mansions with marble floors. Above it all, open my doors. Couple plaques on the wall. Hoop court where my friends could ball. It may sounds strange but Imma need it all. When I spend some afar, I hit the road when I get the car. Got some family members that I don't see at all. It pays off cuz a man gon be a man and do what he gotta do. Baby, this is rolling papers two. (This is rolling papers two). (This is rolling papers two). Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it. When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it. (Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it. When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it)"
rooftops (featuring curren$y),"[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]. And they say they ballin' but I do it how the pros do. Where we goin next? We gon let my hoes choose. No socks and my boat shoes. Guess a nigga eating good like whole foods. Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew. Bad bitch ride with me so she pose too. See me and my guys like a plane flown through. Hella high roll up weed up like I'm supposed too. And now I'm into big things. On the building you need to know the tenant rate. Gettin paid still ridin no shirt. Let a bitch give me brain call it home work. Niggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work. [Chorus:]. Alota shit done change. New clothes new car new things. Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom. Came up that's what they say. Used to not be allowed in the building. But now we on the roof top. Used to not be allowedd in the building. But now we on the roof top. Slow money just better than gettin' no money. [Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]. Learn to get good show money, that's yo money. Get comfortable with it, really know money. Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me. Self made nigga, well played. I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade. You tryna copy what's done, I'm tryna innovate. And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate. BIG MISTAKE. I'm too busy finding places and trips to take. The more I smoke the more money my business make. Remember they used to be like ""who is this? "". Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day. When you around the real, you keep it real everyday. My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say. Either you getting paid, or you paying to play. Either you on your grind or you stay out the way. [Chorus]. [Verse 3: Curren$y]. Uhh, just made a million, got another million on my schedule. The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless. You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did. They hatin was the fuel for this shit so you wrote your own check off a hoe ass. Sweatin bullets at home, wondering if she coming back. and she she can smell it on ya. That's why you only see her when you buying stuff for her. We was sneaking in then it was general admission. Now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it. Our windows ain't tinted, pimpin, I ain't trippin'. Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin. We plooted this out, one night in the city. Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twisting. Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it. Twit-pic'ing when we get it and they mad at us. Fuck them niggas. [Chorus]. [Wiz Khalifa]. Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes. When you putting in work, that's how it goes. Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes. When you putting in work, that's how it goes. Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes. When you putting in work, that's how it goes. Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes. When you putting in work, that's how it goes. And if the kids tryna be like me, they probably smoking bout an O.. Oh, ain't my fault though!"

And to think this the life that I chose?. Arguing with attendants who've shorted my flight clothes. And every girl I fuck, feel like her boyfriend might know. Smokin' all this weed as it smells, my weed come in barrels. Fuck wit bitches who fiend for gucci and need her chanel. Nigga, I'm higher off life so my eyes low.

"sleazy remix 2.0 (get sleazier) (feat. ke$ha, andre 3000, t.i, lil wayne)","(Kesha). I don't need you or your brand new Benz. Or your bouji friends. I don't need love looking like diamonds. Looking like diamonds. (Wiz Khalifa). Okay I'm young and I'm tatted. I get them bucks like an addict. Rocking this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric. I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it. And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic. Okay no need to panic,. I'm on a beach where the sand is. Somewhere smokin' on medication, no I won't need a bandage. Some would look at my age and try to say. I'm young and I'm handsome. I say I'm filthy fucking rich,. So I'm an old dirty bastard. And my cribs a disaster and my kush is the master. I was in my yellow car but my Ferrari go faster. Sounding like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers. On the remix with Kesha, bout to go see the cashier. On the grind so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it. I look down and see a hundred thou' and think its time to get it. Brought a lot of marijauna and I'm here to share it. No it's not a problem, better get it,. Then I won't be here tomorrow, momma. (Kesha). I don't need you or your brand new Benz. Or your bouji friends. And I don't need love looking like diamonds. Looking like diamonds. I don't need you or your brand new Benz. Or your bouji friends. And I don't need love looking like diamonds. Looking like diamonds. (Andre 3000). We start out so cute in our baby pictures. That momma shot for our daddy. So that hewouldn't forget you. He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember. If not he's human, I'm human,. You human, we'll forgive him. God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him. He's such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him. I'm only 8, I'm not old enough, guess it's complicated. Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated. I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated. I was gon' save it for later but later look like maybe. This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes. Would be all new and frou frou, but its the 1980?s. But now that we are cool cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys. She say ""Stacks, you're true blue?"". I said ""Nah, I'm Navy"". I call her Kesha, she like it, because it's hood to her. She call me Andre 6000 because I'm good to her. (Kesha). I don't need you or your brand new Benz. Or your bouji friends. And I don't need love looking like diamonds. Looking like diamonds. I don't need you or your brand new Benz. Or your bouji friends. And I don't need love looking like diamonds. Looking like diamonds. (T.I). What then?. Hey Kesha what up boo its me. Do you know what to do wit me?. Bad bitches, I got two of me. Well you better make it two or three. Bad bitches know me. So don't bother introducing me. They want me more than diamonds. Wipe me down bitch, I'm super clean. I'm hella cold, mega paid,. Making moves, doing things. Bitches stay queued and they all wanna do the king. I'm ballin', royalty, knew it when I seen her. I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner. My demeanor something special and this dick is so impressive. Bitch I bet you take it off and take it wit you if I let you. I ain't trippin', I'm just here,. They couldn't catch you and I got you. Bitch my swagger super natural. Get you pregnant looking at you. I ain't nothing like them other dudes. I'm an atom bomb, they a molecule. Still paint ballin' out the frame, stuntin' like a fool. (Kesha). I don't need you or your brand new Benz. Or your bouji friends. And I don't need love looking like diamonds. Looking like diamonds. I don't need you or your brand new Benz. Or your bouji friends. And I don't need love looking like diamonds. Looking like diamonds. Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum. The beat's so fat gonna make me come. Over to your place!. Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum. The beat's so fat, gonna make me come. Over to your place!. (Lil Wayne). We be on that shit that no one be on. Thats what we on, smoke that neon. Kings of Leon, Dynamite Napoleon. Got some skinny's and a tee on. And some vans and my man's got the ratchet. While I'm laying in some pussy you be laying in a casket. And I'm just saying, I'm just spazzing. I'm just smashing, I'm just nasty. If you 'bout it, bust it open. Oh you fancy man,. I got so many flows like mansion. Catch a tantrum, know a girl called Cleopatra. She a throw that pussy at ya. I'm financially straight like a lion. I ain't lying. And all my hoes on they toes.

smoke chambers,"Back when I was a kid I used to drive alone. Always feeling like I was stuck out here on my own. Now my pockets is full and I'm still riding slow. What goes on in my head, don't nobody really know. I'm in the light, all on my life get put on display. Nothing to call my own, ducking, dodging everyday. Put that camera phone away and keep it real with me. Time and time again I'm searching for reality. And feeling so alone. Alone again (x3). Alone. I'm smoking that weed everyday but never hide my faith. They calling my phone, I don't even got the time a day. Don't know their motives anymore that's why I hesitate. I'm tired of partying and getting drunk. I'm trying to elevate. I remember back in the day, I ain't had no cash. I was coming up off of nothing hoping it would last. Now it's 2015 and I got it all. Feeling like I did, when I started on my own. Out here all alone. Alone again (x3). No use looking out. It's within that brings that. Lonely feeling. Understand that when you leave here. You'll be clear. Among the better men"

Don't see me face to face so you have to talk about me when i gone. [chorus]. Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney). Niggas who can't support their own. . So keep pay me from the crowd.

I remember them same hoes aint even notice us. Get you to buy us a drink than its over cuz. We back around the time that she sober'd up. Shit aint been the same since the limosuine showed up. The best moments of my life. Never filled this much plastic off of polo in my life. Rarely gon to see, smoking with ya wife. Plus anything you want i can afford to buy it twice. It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'. Like ""where did all my paper go"". Grow some more weed and get medicated. Everyday is a holiday so we celebrated. [chorus]"

Smoking my ganja public. I'm all about that money. Dress like everyday sunny. Rolling weed like a Marley. Smile like everything funny. But this industry shady. Most these niggas are crazy. Most of them quick to lose they soul, no if or a maybe. These nudies what I'm wearing. The truth is what you're hearing. The bong is what I'm clearing. The kush is overbearing. Ferrari's what I'm steering. I'm smoking while I'm driving. Keep looking in the mirror. Make sure no ones behind us. Cause niggas get jealous when your bank start to swell up. So much that people at the bank start to tell us. You need to have somebody bank for you fellas. [Hook: Wiz Khalifa]. Look at me (look at me, look at me). Look at me (look at me, look at me).

Look at them and look at me. [Verse 2: 50 Cent]. I paint a perfect picture, a perfect portrait. Poverty, robbery kill or be killed psychology. I shine just me and my nine. Screw you niggas 8 o clock sharp like this Columbine. Guess I'm one of a kind. I see you niggas soft when a shell hit your face. I hit your weight, that flip your coffin. Bitch get to walkin', this sabrina's orphan. I'm like the virus, the 38, the pop cyrus. Warriors I'm victorious. Come out to play, I mean right away. Shirt Ferrogamo, Emporio Armani drawers. Outlaw nigga break all kind of laws. It's hard bottom line. Tie money, frozen time. AP Royal Oak. Kush smoke bag the coke. Push the dope, cut throat, so what. I cut throat and fuck with hoes. So I ain't gotta say it's time to go. She already know for sure when it's time to go. [Hook: Wiz Khalifa]. . By:DjalmaRabelo"

Tree's prepared and properly cultivated. I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals. Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now. Never treat ya wrong, to each his own. Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong. We up in smoke, making street schemes. Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams. Break it down, put it in the zig zag. And pull the top back and let the ass drag. Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch. Executive branch, get a whiff of this. Black car, sack a dank. High school nigga what the fuck you think. I'm passing all my classes with flying colors. And everyday I'm high as a motherfucker. [Chorus]. [Wiz Khalifa:]. Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling. My bitches only notice it if it's potent. Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean. Get in between your legs. Join roaches and ashes all in your bed. You calling her babe, she calling me instead. Cause I put that game all in her hair. She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling. When he ain't have nothing he used to stall em. Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him. And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big. And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is. Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit. Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit. Now she all fuck her man, rubberbands in my pocket. Getting money, going hard for my profit. Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings. Young nigga getting bread, why knock it. [Chorus:]. I'm smoking everywhere I go. (No stick, no seeds, just Al Green). I always gotta keep one rolled. (I keep that, need that, got that). I'm rolling every gram I own. (That purp, that bomb, that kush). Don't gotta understand, they know. I smoke that, fire that, good that good that. In highschool, we do just like we like to. We cordially invite you. Now roll up get high to it. We welcome you to highschool. We do just like we like to. We cordially invite you. Now roll up get high to it. Get high to it. [Chorus:]. I'm smoking everywhere I go.

Eighteen racks I paid it though. To send them goons straight to ya door. To show you niggas what's real. And let you meet that .44. Run your mouth you in the trunk. Glock to your head nowhere to run. Catch you niggas when you by yourself. We gon' hit you niggas with a hundred drums. Boat load no bad bitch. Good drink I'm famished. Bank account outlandish. Big real estate sittin' on land bitch. Niggas out there tryna test me. I put the AK where his chest be. Don't fight with hoes, don't fight with niggas. No security bitch so don't test me. Double cup full I be sippin' up. Mob niggas man real criminals. If a nigga find you they gon' hit ya up. With a Bin Laden chopper that'll split ya up. All these hoes be jockin' tryna get with us. They gon' swallow this nut, no spittin up. Your niggas get murked your niggas in jail. My team gettin' money stay full of drugs. [Refrão: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J] x2.

Now my money feelin' like it's tattooed"
the play,"Tell you about these Taylors. Niggas that I ride for, ugh. We get it on our own. Real niggas in the struggle, you're not alone. We ain't have any major label backin'. Just me and my niggas and we made sure we was crackin'. The biggest squad get the biggest check. Ask around, we the last real niggas left. And there ain't nobody like us. Knew that we was on but the city didn't like us. Fuck your roll, made our own path. Grew up low class, I ain't go to class. Front on the gang and it won't last. You get no pass, ain't no goin' back. You wouldn't have a clue. It's like I wouldn't have any idea what it feel like to be you. When you work hard for everything you got. They can't come take it. When you go back on sayin' you'll keep your word. You can't unbreak it. When we was in that (?) they couldn't see us ballin'. Perfect record, now my team is flawless. Victory nigga, promise I go hard til you sick of me. For my squad, I give all of my energy. Make it hard not to remember me. Want it all, not just a little piece. We really started from nothin'. No handouts dog, we really got it from nothin'. You niggas got it from stuntin', got it from frontin'. Light up a J, I'mma roll up an onion"

Nothing, they aint singing my song. Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along. We flying up, now you want me to take it all off. me to take it all off. Tell a bitch I’ma ball and I’ma buy a new crib for my niggas n all. Cause I remember days we’d sit and picture it all. Nigga swear I’d leave or pictured I’d fall.

Made niggas, paid niggas, all around. One phone call, brr, it's going down. Clique full of psychos, goon in some tight clothes. Need my paper straight, no typos. Right flows, but really I don't write. I'm in the studio all night. Make sure the shit you call your dream is what I really call my life. From my city, harlem nights, you niggas silly - this the 'burg. Not philly, shout them niggas though that wheelie on them bikes. These niggas fans, they just sit in.

I can't stand fake niggas. Walk it how I talk it, if I roll it, I'm a spark it. If she bad, I tell her park it - I'm a hit it like a target. Oh shit! He blowing up your phone again. Must [?] let him know, you ain't coming home again. Leave that man alone, could be doing better. Do it on your own, could be on a jet, flying 'round the globe. Baby we gonna smoke a whole zone. Burning kush till her eyes gone. Cellphone by the remote control. When your girlfriends call, they just get the dial tone. Paper wild long. Try to draw the line between personal and business. But these niggas in their feelings like bitches. Mobbing through the trenches, always on a mission. Rules to the game, start a competition. Khalifa kush keep me high, the world wanna speak. Broke and jail - two things I don't wanna be. You talk tough, but your click is nervous. Wash 'em up, get that quick detergent. Then we done with 'em. There's gotta be somebody to blame. It's a shame, shame, shame. I can't stand fake niggas. I can't stand fake niggas. I can't stand fake niggas. What? What?. I can't stand fake niggas. I can't stand fake niggas. Fake ass, niggas, shit.

Closing the cabin door and reving up all my engines. The weed is rolled, the drink is cold. it's new to you, to me it's old. C-E-O, these off brand niggas ain't really the future, Ms. Cleo. High when I approach, been known, to leave weed crumbs and trails of Sour D smoke. The irony, of suckas who predicted the planes land and now they wanna fly with me. I just let it boost my confidence, roll another joint, drop pilot shit. O-K.. . [Refrão]. This ain't the life that we chose, but it's the life that we living. Know we belong on the top, but we ain't trippin'.. 'Cause we'll get there in a minute. And we'll get there in a minute, 'cause we'll get in there in a minute. Know we belong on the top but we ain't trippin'.. 'Cause we'll get there in a minute.. . [Verso 2]. Ask me if I plan to be roof top chillin' with some pretty ass women, you'd be glad to meet. Trees stuffed in the passenger seat, charge it to my phone, 'couple changes of clothes. And the OG told me all haters expose they self, so it's best to leave it alone. Pop the cork, put the tree in the bone. Been here for a minute you niggas just catchin' on. Master of the craft, I've grown. Haters trail the path, I've flown. it's obvious, suckas talk down but we ain't trippin'. Hoes fuck with us, say we different. At my hotel chillin', bad women come to fill my marijuana prescription. You niggas know the biz, it's Taylor Gang or kill him.. . [Refrão]. This ain't the life that we chose, but it's the life that we living. Know we belong on the top, but we ain't trippin'..

the thrill,"Searching for the thrill of it, thrill of it,. Say that it's love, but to me it's looking counterfeit,. I get done with one and move on to another bitch. Yea college educated, she graduated. Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it. The show was far, you the only one with a car. And your girlfriends, but being thats shes a big fan, of course she made it. Most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill they chase it. But you just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous. So I just name a time and a place and your game for it. Value player, hotel room, meet you there. [{background}:]. {Walking on a dream. How can I explain. Talking to myself}. Just travelin' the world. {Will I see again}. Tryin' different drugs and girls. {We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it.

And then I'm um probably just gonna go back smoke another one in an hour. Just get real airy, fuckin' dreamy and shit. Wake up drunk go to sleep fucked up. We both amazed at what we just done. Mixin' drinks, knowin we'll regret this. Ain't been asleep yet, room service bringin' us breakfast. All this money, darlin, what else is left to do. But smoke an enjoy my presidential view. Got a swimmin pool in my living room. On stage, interviews, tons of sour, let's consume. {We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it.

Call me Aloe Blacc cause I Need That Dollar yo. ha ha. Hic-hic-hiccup. Blame it on the liquor. I came through like a stick up. Now I'm ballin' like a kick up. I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck. And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up. Come out and play, pour out another bottle. Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow. I do it for the thrill. You know I love the rush. And once you get me going I can never get enough. [Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]. I grew tired of the same, then one night. Packed my things, told the one I love. I'll be back one day. Through the fight, through the pain. Booked a flight, took a plane. Told her not to cry. I'll be back one day. Been dreaming this since I was young. So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone). Til I'm gone (gone). Til I'm gone. But I wont be gone for too long. [Tinie Tempah - verse 2]. In Amsterdam ?. Just came off Aussie tour. You've never seen this before?. I'm the one like 2 plus 3. M-M-M-Minus four. Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum. Everytime I can stalk. Yeh, yeh, I'm honest I landed in a rocket. With a crown inside my watch and silver B sign on my bonnet. You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest. Ip dip do muthaf-cker you are not it. Come out and play, pour out another bottle. Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow. I do it for the thrill. You know I love the rush. And once you get me going I can never get enough. [Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]. I grew tired of the same, then one night. Packed my things, told the one I love. I'll be back one day. Through the fight, through the pain. Booked a flight, took a plane. Told her not to cry. I'll be back one day. [Tinie Tempah - Verse 2]. Ok I'm in it, I'm in it to the finish. I keep them bottles coming like my card aint got no limit. Got some friends that playing football. And some friends that playing cricket. And a mistress that is fine like a f-cking parking ticket. Haha. I said I'm in it, I'm in it til the finish. I keep them bottles coming til there aint nothing in it. I'm like Mario on mushrooms. I'm like Popeye on some spinach. We gon keep it coming till I no speaka no english. Ahh. [Chorus]. I grew tired of the same, then one night. Packed my things, told the one I love. I'll be back one day.

we own it,"Money's the motivation - money's the conversation. You on vacation, we gettin' paid, so. We don't placate 'em, I did it for the fam'. It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am. Yeah - it's the life I chose. Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed. And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove. You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed. Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'. Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it. You use plastic, we 'bout cash. I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!. [Hook]. I never fear death or dying. I only fear never trying. I am whatever I am. Only God can judge me now. One shot, everything rides on. Tonight, even if I've got. Three strikes, I'mma go for it. This moment, we own it. And I'm not to be played with. Because it could get dangerous. See these people I ride with. This moment, we own it. And the same ones I ride with. be the same ones that I die with. Put it all out on the line with. If you lookin' for me you can find Wiz. In the new car or the Crown with my new broad. That's a fine chick, and the Weather Squad, I'm down with. Ain't no way around it. What you say? Tell me what you say?. Workin' hard, reppin' for my dawgs, so this every day. Takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball like the mob. All you do is call, catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa. [Hook]. I never fear death or dying. I only fear never trying. I am whatever I am. Only God can judge me now. One shot, everything rides on. Tonight, even if I've got. Three strikes, I'mma go for it. This moment, we own it. And I'm not to be played with. Because it could get dangerous. See these people I ride with. This moment, we own it. This the biggest day of my life. We got big guns, been graduated from knives. Day in the life, and I'm ready to ride. Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside. Or - financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet. Ridin' with the plug so I'm close to the outlet. At the red light, rims, sittin' on the set. I look better on your girl than her outfit. Stuck to the plan, always said that we would stand up. Never ran, we the fam, and loyalty never change up. Been down since day one, look at where we came from. Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say somethin'. One thing about it, got a problem? I've got the same one. Money rolls we fold, plenty clubs we close. follow the same code. Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control. One shot, everything rides on. Tonight, even if I've got. Three strikes, I'mma go for it. This moment, we own it. And I'm not to be played with. Because it could get dangerous. See these people I ride with. This moment, we own it"
we're done,"[Chorus]. We're done, but it's not over. I'm started again, out to the end of the day. It keeps getting better. Don't be afraid, we'll do it together. Started from nothing, ended up with everything. From the house, to the whips. Taking trips to any place that you care to name. Champagne, skydivin'. EZ wider papers, no blunts, hit it once you mile high. Runnin' now I'm livin' how I'm supposed to. Laughing at you haters like I told you. I just tell the waitress keep pouring. Get infront of the camera keep posing. Too much bank to be rolled in. That's why I stay golden, till the cake gets swollen. And you just can't fold it. or it's old and molded. And the crust get golden. [Chorus x2]. You stay the night cause you say my life is exciting. Wake up still drunk not going to work cause you like it. Livin' with no regrets. Buyin' more bottles while we got ones I ain't even opened yet. Notice that first thought you wanna talk about your boyfriend. Now everytime he callin' you ignoring them. Somewhere tasting trees. Cat and mouse. You chase me I'll chase this cheese. While we're young, one. [Chorus x2]"
weed brownies,"Is this the top?. The top of the world?. Top floor? there's weed in the ashtray. It's top-shelf... cap!. Riding in my challenger. Faded off this sticky brownie. Turning down the music cause. This weed is loud enough already. Niggas ask about my pay. I say I keep it steady. Gripping on the wheel, spending. Money like a politician. Tipping on a bill, it's going down. Like this bitch was sitting on the hill. I keep my girlfriend in them expensive. Sort of heels. furs and shit. Eat champagne and lobster cause. I fucking deserve this shit. Cap! niggas say I've got an old soul. Well, I tell them that I'm here muthafucka. And I made it cause my flow cold. I'mma roll some of this weed, I'mma pass it to you. Everybody's so gone. homie, I got papers. And vaporizers, flavors to stablize ya. Thoroughly-baked cake, can't say a thing. With my eyes shut. They say they don't, they do. But they don't know who we are. Superstars. I'm out of here, stratosphere. Paper hella-straight, nappy hair. Bitches seen that the? was even there. When we pulled up lit like times square. When we pulled up lit like road flares. When we pulled off, them hoes disappeared. Because they know what we be doing over here. She just wanna be high in her underwear. With her iphone plugged in the wall, power loss. Stepping out the shower, threw her a shirt to. Towel off with. one of the two qualities I want. In a bitch, cause baby girl, fuckin with me. Is some major shit, feel? warning. I gotta wake up to a bj every morning. And a j while I'm yawning, darling. I got papers and vaporizers, flavors. To stablize ya, I'm a fully baked potato. Spending my cheddar and chives. I'm dedicated, hella-faded, high as hell. I'm levitating. I'm rolling up, fuck a wheelchair. Ironically, my shit's medicated. Your eyes closed cause you asleep. My eyes closed cause I'm meditating. I gotta go make reservations. At a real nigga's destination. Two girls in the tub, that's luxury. You disagree? that's fuckery!. Saying ""fuck you"" cause you can't fuck with me. I need my dick sucked, but I'm sucka-free. You are who it sucks to be. I'm a company, buy ""finally famous"". Over everything, that's my company. You already know, nigga. Collect the money like it's old, nigga. And I'mma blow it like it's rolled, nigga. And I be stuntin til I'm old, nigga. Weed, money and hoes - what a hell of a night!. Fuck you mean? this is everyday life. She in the mirror making sure she wearing it right. It's a pear-shaped present where I'm appearing tonight"

Alrighty now, ha, look at me, rose, I'm on nigga. 15 grand on a what, That's just my phone, nigga. Northern California, where blunts look like cones, nigga. Two up, two down, make that switch, yeah. [Hook]. Call em Yoko Ono. Only ride solo. Mission for the dolo. One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive. She's a man eater, ski mask diva. She might leave you, but you can never leave her. You ain't never had someone, you can never keep her. Tricking on the next man, he can't have her either. Call her Yoko Ono. [Wiz Khalifa]. Shades on, Polo white T. Me leaving here alone? That's unlikely. Not a stoner bitch, but she like me. Tryna get that final cut like Spike Lee. I jack them hoes, direct them hoes. Take ‘em home and let them hoes go live out their fantasies. They're popping pills, I'm rolling weed. Even got a couple bad bitches overseas. Out the back, as ain't no tags when I'm shopping. And my bad filled with options so don't ask what it cost. I'm in a Maserati coupe going so fast that I lost ‘em. And my bitch got so much swag that these bad bitches on us. Ah! Killing y'all, pow! (dag) get a a coffin. [Hook]. Call em Yoko Ono. Only ride solo. Mission for the dolo. One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive. She's a man eater, ski mask diva. She might leave you, but you can never leave her. You ain't never had someone, you can never keep her. Tricking on the next man, he can't have her either. Call her Yoko Ono. [Big K. R. I. T]. She should like that, kush it up and write back. When you send her messages talkin' bout a nightcap. She tell you she like rap. You tell her you might rap. She pretend your shit jammin', really you quite wack. She just want a nice bag, wrist game, ice pack. Prada clutch, price tag. What you spend? twice that. Put her in the game cause you hoping she'll hype that. So you can go along, OD, catch a spike that. You can never wife that. Never ever pipe that. Good enough to make her settle down. She aint like that. Punch a nigga in the mouth, dare a nigga fight back. Roll a nigga weed up and ask him where the light at. [Hook]. Call em Yoko Ono. Only ride solo. Mission for the dolo. One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive. She's a man eater, ski mask diva. She might leave you, but you can never leave her. You ain't never had someone, you can never keep her. Tricking on the next man, he can't have her either. Call her Yoko Ono"
you and your friends (feat. snoop dogg & ty dolla $ign),"I got all these J's rolled up. And got all these drinks poured up. I bought all these bottles up in this club. Came here with all of my dogs.

He talk a lot of shit, but he ain't really on. He hit it too soft, but me I go hard, like. Oohy baby, when you with me you go crazy. I want you to be my lady. Girl you could bring your girlfriends, I ain't hating. I got all these J's rolled up. And got all these drinks poured up. I bought all these bottles up in this club. Came here with all of my dogs.

Coke white, so tight, game over. Coupe to the block, bop to the bang. Car full of girls in a blue Mustang. Four y'all, more y'all, caravan. V. I. P model in hand, bottle in hand. Wobble again. I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame. On the highway, just me and Wiz. With a dirt dozen, about to handle this. Was they cousins or was they twins?. I love it when they both go all in. Like that, this one and that one. See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one. Bet she pay what she weigh. I'm looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way. I got all these J's rolled up. And got all these drinks poured up. I bought all these bottles up in this club. Came here with all of my dogs. But I'm tryna leave with you and your friends. You and your friends. Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends. You and your friends, ball. I got all these J's rolled up. And got all these drinks poured up.

zoney (feat. sebastian),"Yeah it's real shit. Let me roll this weed up and wrap this shit. You know. Too much purple for me. Uh, coming up I always thought. I'd be the runner up. Gave my all but it felt like it wasn't enough. I remember spending summers in the studio. My pops told me have fun be a kid for once. What he ain't know. Was for a kid a that I had big dreams. I take a small frame turn it into a big screen. Taking best friends turn them to a good team. I'm watching scarface living all the good scenes. Burning dope thinking about the days. When I was broke. Desperate niggas in my city don't know. How to cope. Young nigga said he starving. He ain't got a meal. Down to catch a body all about a dollar bill. My niggas is all I got so it's more than trust. We ain't even have a car we was on the bus. Public transportation. Now it's underground we make it. Throw it in the safe I can't hear what they say. I'm packing up my bags. Packing up my bags, packing up my bags. I gotta catch a plane. Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane. I can't be at home. Can't be at home, can't be at home. I gotta be away. Gotta be away, gotta be away. There's just way to many niggas. I use to know back in the day. Now when I see them out. I just don't got shit to say to you niggas. When I see you in the club. I make my way through you niggas. You must be mad I ain't wait on you. But no matter the circumstances. I never get hate on you. I'm just taking all my dream. Trying to make it facts. Putting on for my team trying to make it crack. Getting all sorts of green trying to make a stack. Lose yourself in my city and never make it back. Said he will but the chances. Are he will never change. Daddy sold dope. But you would probably do the same thing. If I get $30k. I would probably spend it on my wrist. Fuck these politics. When these kids ain't have a pot to piss. Fuck the promises. The shit I'm on is common sense. If you ain't talking them I'm gone. I'm packing up my bags. Packing up my bags, packing up my bags. I gotta catch a plane. Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane. I can't be at home. Can't be at home, can't be at home. I gotta be away. Gotta be away, gotta be away. Say hello, my name is sebastian. Hello, my name is sebastian. Do you love your daddy?. Yeah. Say you love your daddy. I love you daddy. Say I miss you daddy. I miss you daddy. Go to the mic and say ""yo"". Yo. Say whats cracking. Whats cracking. Say taylor gang. Taylor gang. (ha) say tgod. Tgog. (ha, ha, ha). Say ""I love my daddy"". I love you to handsome boy. Say pittsburg. Pittsburg!. (ha, ha, ha). Do daddy laugh. (ha, ha, ha)"
