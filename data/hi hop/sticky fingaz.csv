state vs kirk jones,"[Rah Digga]. Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing. Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence. Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin. Prosecution set it with your opening statement. [Canibus]. Your honor, before we get started. I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed. Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara. His two year old daughter T'wanna. And the baby's mamma Sandra. [He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]. [Rah Digga]. Order in the court!. [Canibus]. I'm sorry for the outburst your honor. I have an original copy of the police report. January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught. The forensic report states there was a gun in the car. And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm. Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle. Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you. You said you was outside the store in Manhattan. So could you please tell this court what you saw happened. [Superb]. Yeah he killed Tyrone. I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything. The worst shit I saw in my life. I wanna testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie. [Canibus]. Did you see that man in court today?. Do you think that you could point him out?. [Superb]. Yes that's him right there. [Canibus]. Are you sure?. [Superb]. Yeah without a doubt. Same nigga that took my Pumas but I aint hold no grudge. Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood. [Canibus]. You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before. In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?. [Redman]. Your honor, objection!. His opinion should be stricken from the record!. [Rah Digga]. Objection sustained, prosecution next question. [Canibus]. I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour. Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?. [Scarred 4 Life]. Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class. Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass. And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass. He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask. I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor. Yo I swore I was a goner for sure. He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet. It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it. [Canibus]. Is that the moment when he shot him?. [Scarred 4 Life]. Yeah man that's when he popped him. I was so scared I laid there, played possum. He started to blast this way, til the gat was empty. He took the gun handle and broke the glass display. He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store. And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor. I can't remember no more, that's all that.... [Canibus]. Okay, okay calm down. I have no further questions your honor. [Rah Digga]. Court is now in session, now gettin back to business. Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness. [Redman].

It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it. It happened so fast, I didn't see alot of it. But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus. [Redman]. Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous. There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages. Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]. You lyin in the stand to get him fryin in the pan. Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone. You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home.

another niguh,"[Chorus]. Who are you to question, how I live. When the whole entire world is negative. I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive. Keep my hustle in the street til the day I die. [Sticky Fingaz]. From NY, Southside where guns hide. Shells fly, eyed red, I'm dumb high. Got one eye, you get wet and hung dry. Leave you tongue-tied, mothers watch their young die. Nig' you wan' die? Fuck a car through run by. I'll be waitin at your crib for my money til the sun die. Six niggaz eat, divided off one pie. A nigga as ill as me is so hard to come by. Squeeze this rap shit til the well run dry. I never spoke to one time not even one time. Look at my brain it's every rapper combined. I'm bout to OD on some shit like Sublime. [Chorus]. Who are you to question, how I live. When the whole entire world is negative. I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive. Keep my hustle in the street til the day I die. I'm just another face from a movie screen. A tough little nigga from a magazine. I said you're lookin for trouble if you want his cream. Remember everything ain't what it seem. Now can you feel me? Can you feel me?. Can you feel me? Can you feel me motherfucker?. Can you feel me? Can you feel me?. Can you feel me? Then get it right motherfucker. [Sticky Fingaz]. A'yo pass that, niggaz like that get blast at. Your life flashback, you was born out the asscrack. You mad wack, walk around with that gas pack. You get laughed at and asked that where the mask at. 15.3 match that, coupe hatchback. I'm a class act, got assets, where the ass at?. I do you like I did them niggaz on the last track. We like dice, if you gon' roll don't ass bet. I won't rest in peace, even in my casket. Had the '03 hum' in '02 and I crashed that. I rap slash act, seven digits I cash that. Niggaz wan' dead the beef now but it's passed that. [Chorus]"
baby brother,"[Sticky talking]. Let me call this nigga. Come on man; pick up the damn phone. [Brother]. Hello. [Sticky]. I got your pictures, damn we look just alike. A younger version of me, half my age same height. I played ""beat you up"", made you tough, thought you to fight. Put you on, showed you things, put up your first bite. Now you on the streets making the same mistakes I did. That got me nowhere, so I'm trapped upstate in this bid. Caged like an animal ain't no way to live. Got a baby on the way, who gone father my kid. Where you going now I can clearly see. You either going in an bag or in jail with me. Remember when we was younger and you promised me. You be the first in our fam with al college degree. I know you see the cars, the girls, the clothes, the jewels. And think it's all about the money, heard you dropped out of school. I ain't trying preach but if I don't, who gonna. Couldn't live with myself if you died on the corner. You're my baby brother. [Chorus: Dave Hollister]. You are my baby brother. And you know I love you nigga. I'm just trying to keep you out there. You don't want to end up in here. [Brother]. I hear what you saying big brother, but listen to me. I ain't trying to be the nigga working Mickey D. When I can hustle on the block and come home with a gee. Yeah you right I want jewels and push a luxury V. But what's wrong with that, I wanna love comfortably. Just like the next man driving round the hood in my Lex Land. I ain't got nobody taking care of me. And as far as a school, well it just ain't for me. [Sticky & Brother]. So what you wanna do huh. What you gone sell drugs all your life. (I might). See you ain't even right. Maybe when you sober up to see the light. (Hold up, this is my life, I live it anyway that I like). Yo look I'm just trying to help. You know all you want to do is get blunted. (I need money, my wifey got a seed in her stomach). If you can't see the cycle then you must be blind. And your child getting a father that was just like mine. You're my baby brother. Chorus. [Sticky & Brother]. So is you like that. I mean what's the deal?. Don't you too worry about trying to keep it real?. (Man whatever, this is how you feel then this how you feel). Yo what's this I hear, you had a gun concealed. (Yeah, I keep my nine (See this what I?). (Hold up, let me speak my mind. Look at you, you can't even talk you doing mad time). Yeah look at me, this is how you wanna be. Locked up, the cops tell you where you can pee. (I got to go man). Ooh you don't even want to hear me out?. (Yeah, but you talking mad shit I don't even care about). All I saying is that you got to be more responsible. (Aight man, whatever I'm a talk to you). [Sticky]. Yo, yo.... Damn. He gone end up just like me. Chorus"

caugh in da game,"[Chorus]. In these streets, where we from. We all caught in the game. Tryna pull our life out of the drain. If you don't make it, you the one to blame. In this life, that we live. We only tryna survive. It's hard with the blind leading the blind. Everybody here stuck in the grind. [Sticky Fingaz]. They said I was crazy, nigga sick in the head. Who raised me? My mother was sick in the bed. How could you blame me? On the block gettin that bread. They couldn't change me, too hot, dippin them feds. I made a promise, not to go back to jail. Under my garments, gun tuck, packin that steel. But reguardless, this nigga here is out of the field. Now my partners is only money, that's real. I got my mind made up, my shine ain't up. Until I'm in that casket, my time ain't up. Tell you bout my lifestyle, I'll walk you through. First mix the Louie wit the Johnnie-Walker blue. Now peep the hooptie, I'm followed by my crew. Hundred thou' in jewelry when the God come through. I kept it thorough with my ear to the streets. Now we gettin Cash Money without the gold teeth. [Chorus]. In these streets, where we from. We all caught in the game. Tryna pull our life out of the drain. If you don't make it, you the one to blame. In this life, that we live. We only tryna survive. It's hard with the blind leading the blind. Everybody here stuck in the grind. [Sticky Fingaz]. I done seen pain, felt pain and lived pain nigga. Half my life in these streets down the drain. Analyze the game through the eyes of my father. Had to feel my way through with the revolver. That goes to tell you he ain't show me nothin. Mad at the world when they ain't owe me nothin. So I apply pressure, why not for more measure. And more cake, we turn hoods to whole states. For my real niggaz, dressed in greens is upstate. Trapped in that cold cell with no bail. We ain't mean to hurt nobody to get them dollars up. Half my niggaz goin dead'll push ya flowers up. I'm fresh out the county, with no shoe laces. They thought they could stop us with probation?. We just live on the run and switch up locations. Play the future by the air until it's time to face it. [Chorus]. In these streets, where we from. We all caught in the game. Tryna pull our life out of the drain. If you don't make it, you the one to blame. In this life, that we live. We only tryna survive. It's hard with the blind leading the blind. Everybody here stuck in the grind. (?). Young niggaz stay hungry for war. Bred and raised by hustlers and whores. Born the struggle in this jungle, escape poor. While the White House got ten rooms with ten blind doors. I was born to fight for what's right, by the day and night. Prayin for life cause shit ain't tight in these streets. That's why I stay squeezin my heat. And strippin life from mammals. A hungry young hustler ready to gamble. For a better way of livin so fuck sittin in prison. Cause every niggaz a? victimized by the system. Cops and cellblocks, why hell rots. Young thugs from Queens to?. Slugs give shellshocks in these streets. where funeral bells knock. [Chorus]. In these streets, where we from. We all caught in the game. Tryna pull our life out of the drain. If you don't make it, you the one to blame. In this life, that we live. We only tryna survive. It's hard with the blind leading the blind. Everybody here stuck in the grind"

Victoria don't know how to keep a secret. like a nigga need pussy, a bitch need dick. statistics show that out of every ten hoes. whether married or in love done cheatin' befo'. and if they did it once, they'll probably do it again. turn your back, Jerry Springer style, screwin' your friend. and that alone's enough to make any niggas furious. nigga you wasn't hittin' it right, maybe she's just curious. (Verse 1). You all serious, your girl all gigglin'. 'cause she know I'm right, somebody slid up in that clitoris. (somebody slid up in that clitoris). (somebody slid up in that clitoris). how to know if your girl cheatin'. does she go out every weekend?. freakin', you and her hardly speakin'. she hang with hoes, and you hate them chicks. leave the club around Three, don't get home 'till Six. probably met some nigga, she ain't goin' home. claim the battery died on her mobile phone. you found a number, she swear she don't know who's it is. she know more niggas than you in the music biz. you try to talk to her, but she's in her own World. on the phone with some nigga, actin' like it's her home girl. you don't think your girl got bones in her closet?. bring it up she starts an arguement and change the topic.. (Chorus 2). aiyo, turn it up, and take a look at your bitch. if she smilin' somebody stuck a dick in your bitch. now think about when you're not around, who she be wit'?. and think about the bullshit you got away wit'. (Verse 2). You better pay attention now, or you gon' cry later. middle of the night, a nigga blowin' up her skypager. you can't hear it though, she got it on vibrator. she be creepin' 'cause you think she gon' violate her. when you havin' sex is she already sore?. did the pussy feel like it was tighter before?. is she gettin' gifts she couldn't only afford?. been together for a Month and she already bored?. if your girl is cheatin' with her legs open wide. you never know, she could be playin' from both sides. she could be playin' with another chick G.. 'cause nowadays all bitches ain't strictly dickly.. (Chorus 2) - 2X. (Talking to girl). Aiyo.... huh?.... let me ask you somethin'.... yeah?.... you love me?. yeah I love you. huh...yeah right.... (Chorus 3: repeat 2X). It was just sex, probably ain't mean nothin' to her. it was just sex, it was just a fuck to her. no emotion, no love, no feelings inside. it was only one time, it was only one night"

Never seen nothing like this I rip your whole crew. Ever thought about death, that's what you bout to go through. I stay to myself, I'm anti-social. I ghost you, and wild out like I'm supposed to.

[Chorus]. Get it up, huh. The ice on ya wrist player pick it up, huh. My killers in the cut coast stick em up, huh. Ladies grab your shirts and lift em up, huh.

Lemme see your guns, what throw em up, huh. Yo Sticky Fingaz, word up. I told y'all niggaz. Yo come on. Hennesied up, play the cut lighting it up. Rag on my head, eyes lookin half way dead. Brought my thugs to the club, straight off the street. I'm iceburg to my feet about a third of the week. Relax baby don't spazz cuz he touched your ass. I ain't say shit when your friend touched my dick. I see Brooklyn schemin, we all in the spot. But that's hip hop, we rap niggaz from off the block. Is it me or is it gettin hot in here. I think somebody bout to get shot in here. The nine mill guarenteed to clear the spot in here. And we ain't get searched kid, we got glocks in here. Someone bring me to the hoe suckin cocks in here. I think they trying to shut it down, I seen cops in here. I'm the hottest shit Universal got this year. And all my niggaz rockin rocks in here, come on. [Chorus]. Black Trash. Ayo kick that old real shit. That Queens shit. Firemarshall said it's too packed, nigga fuck the law. And the guest list, niggaz bout to rush the door. Got cats online in ties and suits. We come through VIP button flies and boots. Everybody gettin comped, I ain't paying no admission. Stick Fingaz, I can't even pay attention. Love the freaks that tweek and be liftin it up. Love the freaks that ceep and be giving it up. I got twelve inches, I'm well hung. Nine on my dick and three on my toungue. My manager, the bitch name is Helen Wate. Need a free show? Nigga go to Hell and wait. And if God only helped those who help themselves. When I see something, I want em, I help myself. So unless me and you come to an understanding. You gonna be under, and I'ma be standing. [Chorus]. Word up. We takin all y'all money. We takin all y'all bitches. What y'all thought it was. I'm so hot to death. I'll probably get shot to death. Fuck who the cops arrest. My killers is rough, shoot up the club like Puff. Niggaz'll duck, chains tucked, Timbs get scuffed. I pull a four-four from out of the seat. Up out it and beat. Picture me not riding with heat. Jump out of the Jeep. Clear a nigga out of the street. Nobody can creep. Thirty deep nigga, I'm out of your reach. Ain't nothing but killers boasting next to me. I'm prejuduce, I hate every color except for green. In the club, that's were my niggaz jwewlry shop. When the hammer cock, we don't care who we box. So why you come to the club, what you livin it up. Why you fuckin with that chicken, was she givin it up. Why you even cop jewels, what you can't get stuck. Why you never say when, you ain't had enough. [Chorus]. Let's go. Get it up"
ghetto,"[Sticky Fingaz - talking]. If your head is as big as Shamello's. If your bank is the check cashin place. If you put on panty-hose instead of shavin your legs. If you use grease that you used over and over again. If you only go to church on Easter and holidays. Then you ghetto, believe that. [Chorus - Petey Pablo]. Can you be rich and be ghetto? (Yep). And just cause you poor do that mean that you ghetto? (Nope). So people don't understand what it mean to be ghetto. And if you gonna ask then you probably never know. [Sticky Fingaz (Petey Pablo)]. Bein ghetto, it's just the things we do sometimes. Like hangin your clothes on the oven to dry. But you late, you gotta go and they ain't ready yet. (You put 'em on anyway, and rock 'em halfway wet). First you wear then return everything you buy. Always lookin for a discount 'til the day you die. Got three kids, by three different guys. (And all they need to give you is a Mai Tai and a shot). You know you ghetto when you use a wrench for a channel changer. No antenna, you gotta use a metal hanger. Drink from the container and put it back in the fridge. (Knowin damn well the shit was wrong you did). Put salt on your food, before you even taste it. Get a doggy bag, ghetto niggaz ain't wastin shit. You know you ghetto, no, you know you grimy. (When you iron dirty pants 'til them shits get shiny). [Chorus 2x]. [Sticky Fingaz (Petey Pablo)]. The ghetto's not a place, it don't matter what colour you are. You can be white as chalk or as black as tar. And it really don't matter how much money you have. (You can live on Fifth Ave. and be ghetto fab). You know you ghetto when your soap is the size of Chiclet. Run into the kitchen wet for dishwashin liquid. The water cold cause they shut off all your power. (You know you ghetto if you pee in the shower). No toilet paper, somebody used the last you had. No problem, just get a Daily News or a paper bag. Ball it up and crumble it, make it soft in your ass. (But when you flush, the toilet always gets stopped up). And if you got the money, the landlord never get it. We never pay the rent, yo we almost got evicted. If this shit is funny or offendin you. (Chances are, it's because you're ghetto too). [chorus 2x]. Can you be rich and be ghetto (3x). And if you gotta ask then you'll probably never know. Ghetto. East Coast is the ghetto. West Coast is the ghetto. South Side is the ghetto. Everywhere is the ghetto. The ghetto. The ghetto. The ghetto. I'll probably die, in the ghetto.."
hot now,"[Chorus - x2]. Let's get it hot now baby. I keep it gully til I drop dead baby. I told you I ain't got an option baby. I came too far just to stop now baby. But yo yo. [Sticky Fingaz]. Yo we blowin 'em up, holdin 'em up. Swolen 'em up, gang signs throwin 'em up. All these guns don't make me have to open 'em up. I'll open you up, doctors be sewen you up. If you a soldier flags they gon' be foldin 'em up. Every month like PMS, I get the quote of the month. Like I give a fuck, I walk away holdin my nuts. Rollin a dutch, everything that's stolen I touch. Better lace your boots and cock ya fours. And give these niggaz what they askin for. Cause they ain't seen ya face in the streets for a while. Let 'em know you got heat and you puttin it down. [Chorus]. [Sticky Fingaz]. A'yo no fuckin around, buckin around. Duckin 'em down, believe me son, shuttin 'em down. If you commercial put yo' ass under the ground. That's why your wife could never be found when I be in town. You probly taste me when you be tonguin her down. Cause I don't listen - she told me not to cum in her mouth. Thuggin her out, love don't live in this house. I'm talkin sex, money, murder ma that's all I'm about. You better grab her by the hair, slap her ass some more. And give these bitches what they askin for. Cause they ain't seen a nigga this live in a while. Let 'em know you go deep when you dickin 'em down. [Chorus]"
i don't know,"[Chorus: repeat 2X]. I don't know what I wanna do with you. I don't know what I wanna do without you. I don't know what I'm gonna do about you, you, you, you. Let's go, Starsky and Hutch man. Fire and Stick. Light ya blunts up, light ya blunts up. Yo, yo. [Fredro Starr]. I'm 'bout to hit the club. I don't know, on which truck I'm drivin tonight. It's like, I don't know, on which ho I'm fuckin tonight. But yo, I don't know, where should I take her. To the edge water cliffs or back to Southside Jamaica. Bitches be like, I don't know, where they get they clothes from. Industry like, I don't know, where they get they flows from. Niggaz be like, I don't know, where they get they dough from. Posin up in the clubs with guns or wrist frozen. I don't know, nothin when the cops come, I act dumb. I don't know, what weed officer? What gats, huh?. I don't know, shit I told the judge, this is love my nigga, this is negative love. Sticky my cous' said. [Sticky Fingaz]. I don't know, how the hell I got home last night. I don't know, how I blew twenty g's in one night. I don't know, but all I remember's two hos from Virginia out cold like December. Neighbors be like, I don't know, how could they afford that crib they in. I don't know, what these boys do for a livin, shoot. I don't know, but it must be drugs cause they have wild parties and they dress like thugs. Ask myself but, I don't know, why I flooded the watch, flooded the chain. I don't know, why I copped the Benz at a hundred and change. I don't know, why I'm stuck in my ways. And took back the new Hummer when I seen the new Range. They all say. [Chorus]. [Sticky Fingaz]. Yo, where the money at? I don't know. What? You better tell me where the safe at, I don't know. Don't say that one more time, I ain't playin that, I don't know. Ugh, that's the last straw, cocked back the four, put his brains on the wall. I'm in the club and, I don't know, if these little groupies is givin it up. I don't know, should I try to spit game to her friend or just her?. I don't know, what the hell I told her. Though I took her home by the morn', ended up with both of them. [Fredro Starr]. A'yo it musta been God yo cause, I don't know. How we made it out of them projects. I don't know, should I cop the Benz Coupe or the drop Lex. I don't know, should I do it out of spite, twenty niggaz on the bikes, doin. wheelies to the lights. Hos was like, I don't know, I guess they from New York the way that they talk. I don't know, I guess she from L.A. the way that she walk. I don't know, on where you wanna chill. Put your ass on the back and we could slide through the hill. Baby it's real, I don't know, on what you fools thinkin you musta forgot. I don't know, why your bitches call me fire, cause a nigga hot. I don't know, I gutted to Medina, look butter in the Beema, chicks love me in the fever. Kids is like yo. [Chorus]"
i love da streets,"(featuring Omar Epps). This might sound crazy but. I love suffering, I love struggle, I love pain. Cause what don't kill you make you stronger nigga. And I'm as strong as they come. [Chorus]. I love the streets. Cause that's what made me me. Without the streets baby I couldn't eat. I love the streets. And althought we was po'. Without struggle boy you can't grow. I love the streets. And even though we sold drugs. And paid for it in blood. I love the streets. No matter what happend to me. My hood or your hood, it's all good. I love the streets. [Sticky Fingaz]. Right now my life don't mean an awful lot. If I died today who think the world gon' stop?. There's a million niggaz just like me on the block. It's either entertainment or sports or sellin that rock. Think the judge gon' take ya word over a cops?. You be just another nigga that they stick in the box. But we are the streets, what other choice we got?. Then to go hard, give them niggaz all we got. Fuck that, as long as I got breath in my lungs. I'm livin my life, waitin for my death to come. If you made it out the hood then God blessed you son. But if your fam there you ain't out lesson one. Gotta spread around nigga that's what's real to me. Turn on the news, swear the shit be killin me. Yall from the streets probly ain't feelin me. You could take me out the hood but it's still in me. [Chorus]. [Omar Epps]. Fools is fake, I come through with the ghoulish face. Take small step, big moves I make. I could put it to your face then choose your fate. Everyday Thanksgivin, for me two plates. Yeah we do grace, God bless it all. From the mess hall to the boulervard with the dead dogs. When we cough and spit, guns they speak. The same language is the bullets, who talkin shit?. Yo Pac if ya listenin they got the game twisted. Talkin bout the hate you gave little infants. Fuck everybody here today, place ya ways. And ya fade away like the memory of Gotti. Take it back to '90, last year highschool. Didn't graduate though, still had to make dough. That's my word, word for word I understood it all. Had big dreams though the hood is small. [Chorus]"

just like us,"This is as close you gon' get to the streets without gettin shot. [Chorus]. In the streets. Cock guns and bust yo' heat. In the streets. Where we live and die for beef. In the streets. Hos'll set you up, get blood on your sheets. In the streets. By any means we gon' eat. In the streets. Sellin drugs you might blow up. In the streets. They got hos to set you up. In the streets. Even police is corrupt. In the streets. There's a million niggaz just like us. [Sticky Fingaz]. I swear I ain't been the same since they had to bury my pops. I'm uncivilized like I was raised in a box. I'm told get your sister raped nigga makin you watch. Fuck the cops, fuck the world, I'm above the law. They can't catch me, what you think the gloves is for?. Got your ear to the street, you ain't hearin me. Motherfucker, the streets got they ear to me. Speak my name, better think careful duke. Like when clingin on to life who gon' be there for you?. Get blood on they seats, drive you to the hospital. Nobody!!! Cause you goin to hell. I got an image to protect and records to sell. Besides a one sided story is easy to tell. My poster on the wall only way you see me in jail. Sticky Fingaz nigga, the legend, the myth. Niggaz get shot everytime I shoot the gift. [Chorus]. [X-1]. I banged out in dorms and tore mouths off. While yall run to cops as soon as it pops off. I can't respect lames when I'm knowin you soft. That's why I feel the pain for my thugs up north. No regrets in this world, not one care. No respect for this world without no peers. They did me wrong for years, I'm finally gettin back. Never sheaded a tear seein niggaz on they back. Lord knows it hurts to put his people in the dirt. Bullet holes in shirts and chumps buried in skirts. Prayin to God is hard, these streets don't play. But you gotta keep up your guard and hope the pain go away. I'm from where they shoot street lights out. And you gotta yell to talk over passin trains. And watch who you fuck with when passin 'cain. Cause them same fists'll get your wrists trapped in chains, nigga. [Chorus]. [Geneveese]. My killers move triggers and set firearms off. Smoke the type of blunts that set fire alarms off. One shot'll blow your face, chest and your arms off. Murderin Guiliani for all the pain that he's causin. Launderin dirty laundry through banks of corporate ?. Shit doctors can only calm me til the drugs wear off. One pump of the sawed-off and your squad'll be hauled off. Dropped her off in the car lock, locked in the trunk of the car. Shit's official, we spittin through government issue. 40 automatic pistols rippin through brain tissue. Stuffin coke up wit your bitch I'll piss through. And a black on black lambo, puffin on A Line Of Crystal!. Under our politics, codes of the street. Never negotiate with killers with intentions of breach. Only associate with villains if you willin to bleed. Cause leakin'll get your mother hogtied and brutally beat. [Chorus]"
let's do it,"Fuck niggaz though it was man?. Right, right, uh-huh. I'ma holla at 'em dog. Nah mean. Got my nigga, Mike B. South suicide Queens. X-million, bout to tear it down wit my nigga. You know? Stick holla at 'em dog. [Sticky Fingaz]. I'm gettin tired of the war stories, kid I heard 'em all. And before they could fake and make up another one that's false. I'ma take it and break it down, so yall could knock it off. It's my call, in my corner they too soft. Mr. I-Don't-Give-A-Fuck, don't need much. But heat in the truck, weed in the dutch, beats I'm beatin 'em up. Streetsweepin 'em up, niggaz deals is suckers. More than the game, don't let the fame go to your brain. I'm still in the rain, where lives get caught in the drain. It's nothin to me, niggaz ain't fuckin wit me. I dump at your v and leave you niggaz slumped in your seat. Jump if it's beef, but wolves need somethin to eat. Nigga dollar signs cover my eyes, gucci material. Bottom line, hand on my nine wit no serial. First class flights and TV's is digital. [Chorus]. You could bust guns and get it right homey. Up in the club, we came to get it gully. Smoke weed, drink henny, man get it ugly. Hard liquor for sure, cause we don't pop bubbly. Load up your steel, nigga dump it only. We don't talk, true story, all about our money. From the streets we ride, you know our style homey. If shorty wanna bounce wit us then she out homey. [X-1]. Shit, cause it's all official. Load your pistol, I ain't right and I'm sure to hit you. Shoot through walls, you could die with your bitch too. So ladies, get out the way first. You gotta be kiddin dog, I got to spray first, nigga. Turn your promotional van into a hearse. Oh, bitches love the way I sit in the drop, pull up in the spot. They suck cock off the strength of the watch. Lil' homey, and that's alone. Fuck you got guns for if your gats at home?. You need to have 'em on your waste like me. Run, duck, hide from the jake like me. Been around the world on fake ID. I got businesses, shot witnesses. Bottom line: X-1 is hot with this shit. [Chorus]. [Columbo]. Yo woozy, googly and cookie. Roofies and usually on two-three. Luny, disrespectful and moody. Stupid, I hate the world I'm too into me. Drink until I throw up and smoke until I tweak. Can't see me settle for less until I peak. Two milly, I'm too willy. Fifty thousand pills a week, I'm too filthy. Stocks and realty, crops and feel we. Scotch and wisky, I pop til I'm twisty. Talented and gifty, fuck til I'm limp D. I'm so empty, everybodies finish"
licken off in hip hop,"To my niggas in the 2-1-2 and 3-1-0. bitches in the 3-0-5 and 4-0-4. niggas in the 7-1-3 and 2-0-1, 3-1-2, call 9-1-1. [Chorus]. It's Sticky Fingaz licken off in hip-hop {*repeat 3X*}. Every rhyme I kick is a gunshot. [Verse One]. My heart bleeds for you, so don't waste your tears. I'm about 175 in dog years. My blocks so hot step outside and get sunburned. Unless you talking business or money I'm unconcerned. I live for now because my days is numbered. I got a six shot revolver watch the barrel on my gun turn. I'm like an accident just waiting to happen. A nigga fuck, my killas in the cut waitin' to clap 'em. It's pitiful this game is too politcal critical. but let's not talk about the big I's and the little you's. Niggas wouldn't be confused if they mind their p's and q's. Keep your nose out of mine and I won't have to squeeze the two's. And cock the glock, what's that sound?. Everybody know Sticky be puttin down. So watch out watch out, niggas better clear a path. Think I'm scared to blast cause I'm doing flicks on Miramax. and New Line fuck security, my bodyguard is my two nines. Knew I'd make it big in due time. My only lie when my lips move. Gun in my crotch my forth leg is a pistol; who wanna get shot?. Until I smell 'em for myself I don't believe shit stink. robbing niggas for everything but the kitchen sink. And all these whack rappers want deals but no can do. Labels be like ""Don't call us, we'll call you!"". [Chorus] - repeat 2X. [Verse Two]. Back in the day Sticky was stickin' niggas. and strippin niggas and still getting figures. and pistol whippin niggas and flippin niggas. I ran with life bidders and ice pickers. Now wonder if this life fit us in Vegas with strippin white bitches. But that's just a deep thought in the back of my mind. I'm Black Trash true to the streets gritty and grime. I got a bone to pick a holdster with a shoulder grip. concealed inside my leather camoflauge so I can ride notice it?. Don't tell nobody, but between me and you I put three in you. Add you and ya crew to the M-E-N-U. I got bloopers of ya death and I draw it myself. Want the job done right you gotta do it yourself. My code defending my conscience, my mind afflicted with monsters. Kill a nigga over nonsense for five cents. You a glutton for punishment, I'm the nigga runnin shit. YO BREATH STANK THAT CAUSE YOU BE TALKING A TON OF SHIT!. You can't take me out forget about it. Killers in front of ya house forget about it. Y'all niggas don't want no war forget about it. I'll bring it to your front door and you won't do shit about it. You need work come see me son I'm taking applications. You can't beat me join me save yourself the aggravation. You dead if you harm a single hair on my head. My payback is going to cost you a arm and a leg. [Chorus] - repeat 2X. [Outro]. Ooo...... You can run but you can hide. when I come it's do or die. point your guns to the sky. put em up real high"
money talks,"[Sticky Fingaz]. Twas the night before twistmas. And all through the house. We had guns and money around. Layin' on the couch. Was dressed with black jewelry this time. Mmmmmm, c'mon. [Sticky Fingaz]. Everybody want me, I created thieves. Why I'm almost as important as the air you breathe. I been through hard times, when it wasn't enough for me. Stick a weak kid'll have you livin' in luxury. I'm the reason niggas sellin' drugs to fiends. I'm the reason Mr. Simpson got off clean. I'm the reason some parents gotta bury they kids. And I'm the reason why your cousin on the run from feds. I've been through customs, borders. I've been handled by authorities. Drove people crazy when they couldn't see more of me. I've been saved, I've been buried alive. Say my name enough and any nigga testify. Who you think lead that whole seller ass that time. All by myself, I created black on black crime. I'm America's most, I'm tadded up with Ghostt. Even my hand got big, from net to gross. I'm emotionless, yet I breathe jealousy and envy. People kill for me or die to defend me. But in the end am I really worth the sun. Rich people make me work for them. And poor people work for me. Who am I? Nigga I'm money. Who am I? Nigga I'm money. [Hook - Raekwon the Chef]. See the gun wound, went down for you. Who ran up in the house, duke. Caught one from he and for who. When niggas was ready to murder me. You stayed up in the crib, like a bitch. Lookin' ill, and it's lurkin' me (for who?). I got stabbed for you. Yo, shot up the ass for you. Should stop blowin' the cabs for you (for who?). Chill, some niggas called crabs for you. Holdin' them garbage bags for you. Ill, blowin them hags for you. [Sticky Fingaz]. I resort to evil, I don't grow on trees. I'm called by different names, chips, scrilla, cream. And I'm always green whether dirty or clean (Wooooeeee!). Gettin' ya hands on me is the American dream. I'm more powerful than God, or Razale. Cause when you pray to God nigga, you pray for me. I'm an exchange hand to hand, with heavy weapontry. This one couple fucked on me, and slept on me. Up in the dice games niggas stepped on me. Bet on me, couldn't pay, bled on me. I enslaved populations, and controled masses. I come in all forms, coins, paper, plastic. Even credit, I owe you. You work for me nigga, I own you. If you are smart, you make me work for you. All ya life you try and get me and it's hurtin' you. [Hook - Raekwon the Chef]. [Sticky Fingaz]. If you had a million of me, what would you do with me yo?. Would you blow me in a month and have nothin' to show. Or would you invest in me and watch me grow. Take me to the streets and flip me from, do' to sto' to do'. I underseen things I wish I hadn't seen. I came between loved ones and families. A nigga kill his old man to get his hands on me. Got secret ensciptions, examine me. Wanna find me, the bank machine is where I be. And showed 'em to a hundred grand, F.D.I.C.. I'm more notorious than the B.I.G.. I'm so money, who don't wanna be like me. [Hook - Raekwon the Chef] 2x"

no more,Come here girl {*laughter*}. [Chorus]. No more stunts no more lies. No more bitches in my ride. No more allnight parties all leave it behind. No more freaks living right. No more drama in the life. From now on its me and my lady just me and my baby. [Sticky Fingaz]. It starts going on tour the first time. Imagine the thoughts going threw a young rappers mind. Knowing your mine and couldn't give a fuck if you leaved. Things I did its hard for my self to believe. That that I'm sitting back thinking about smoking these trees. Girl you right I'm damn near ruined your life. The only one that was there at the end of the night. My vision was wrong guess what my bitch is gone. And you dont want me now that's why I'm flipping this song. Ignoring my calls dayly fuckers you trying to scare me. Talking on the machine acting like you you can't hear me. Thuggin it out to much I think its rap. Sending you gifts but god damn you sending them back. Killing myself like I ain't got know prize. Seeing your your face every time I close my eyes. Damn girl don't let this be the end of the ride. [Chorus]. [Sticky Fingaz]. I've been around the world seen the best of woman. Bitches liking my style I guess it's the thug in them. I'm just living my life with no time to talk to them. Tired of dissing my wife cuz niggaz we all do it. Hoes calling my cell you cursing about crazy. Got to know that you hate me probably ready to snake me. Like pulling up to the club one night. In my benz with your friends and about to get right. Them birds they got nerve filling my mouth with words. Telling you that I don't car all night they in ya ear. Fuck wat am I suppose to do I'm miles away from home. Heard in your voice your feelings over the phone. Thoose nights we had fights I tried to keep it calm. Throwing my shit outside on the front lawn. I ain't want when I had you now I need you that your gone (damn girl). [Chorus]. Just me and my lady. Just me and my baby
not die'n,"[Verse 1]. If it wasn't for Kool Herc, hip hop wouldn't be created. That's bullshit, I would of created it tens years later. Niggas acting up till the guns is heard. I don't hear you poppin shit now, mums the word. And all you rapping niggas, what, that's all you got. Think you a thug now you doing songs with Pac. Gotta bullet in my stomach doctors scared to remove it. And 25 stitches above my dick to prove it. But I can't die, so I don't wear no vest. I'm like super nigga, gotta SF on my chest. Nigga I'll take a automatic and play Russian roulet. Just to collect, life is short expect my death. Told you once, told you twice. This is the last time you can boooooooop give me a flat line. Even if I bleed to death I can't die. Not even if I fell from ten stories high. Yo, I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying. No matter how many times I get hit with the hot iron. [Chorus]. I'm not die'n. What bring it I'm not die'n. I'm not die'n. What bring it I'm not die'n. I'm not die'n. What bring it I'm not die'n. I'm not die'n. What bring it I'm not die'n. I'm not die'n. What bring it I'm not die'n. I'm not die'n. What bring it I'm not die'n. I'm not die'n. What bring it I'm not die'n. I'm not die'n. What bring it I'm not die'n. [Verse 2]. I tried everything swallowed pills slit my wrist. Made my own brother shoot me, X-1 fuckin missed. Tried to paint the walls with my brain but the gun jammed. At my first shoot out, I stayed everyone ran. I want it rawwwwww, and more than ten different women. Locked myself in the garage with the Benz runnin'. As a kid, they had to watch me carefully. Tried to put the blow dryer in the bath with me. Everywhere I go, I hear voices, who calling me. Doc said my brain damaged but I don't see nothing wrong with me. Maybe that's why half the industry won't do a song with me. I walked amongst the dead. Talked to punks with lead. An eye for an eye. We can all go blind. All you niggas talking about you ain't scared to die. I feel nigga, cause I ain't scared to kill you nigga WHAT. I'ma rule the underground or get shot trying. No matter how many times I get hit with the hot iron. [Chorus]. You can't kill me {8X}"
oh my god,"(Sticky Talking). C'mon man - oh my fucking God man... Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?. It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault. Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man. Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck... [Sticky]. Why? Why? Why God why?. Everything I love always seems to die. Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you. Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you. Is there even a God? Do you even exist?. What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?. I'm talking to a God that I can't see. Can you see me? Can you see me?. [God]. Are you confused my son, and scared?. Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware. [Sticky]. Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me. [God]. It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?. [Sticky]. Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane. [God]. You are talking to yourself we are one of the same. [Sticky]. It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high. And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?. Is there life after death? What were we before birth?. Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?. Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?. Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?. [God]. Excuse me my son, one question at a time. We were never born, and we will never die. In the essence, there Is no such thing as death. How could I write commandments and not have them kept?. The soul is eternal you just change form. Then you come back with a new face on. You can not limit love unless you lack understanding. To answer you yes there is life in other planets. The futures a mystery the past is history. Today is a gift that's why it is called the present. Life is so simple unless you make it confusing. The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using. [Sticky]. Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you. God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you. [Chorus]. If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?. If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?. If you could talk to God. [Sticky]. Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?. [God]. Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity. [Sticky]. I can't think I feel life going down the drain. In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain. [God]. Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts. Your feelings will really erase what you been taught. Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth. I speak through you to aware the youth. [Sticky]. But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?. [God]. In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite. How can there be left if there was never right?. How can something know death if it never knew life?. How can you lose, if nobody won?. How can it be dark if there was never a sun?. That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed. Form must exist for part of themself to manifest. [Sticky]. But I never asked to be born, I hate my life. And if you are God dammit then show me the light. And tell me- what's the meaning of life?. [God]. The process of all life. is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self. [Sticky]. Is God a he or she is there one true religion?. [God]. I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending. We are all one and everything is living. [Chorus]. If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?. If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?. If you could talk to God"
shot up,"Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out. Giva fuck. [Sticky Fingaz]. This is AK-47, banana clip rap. Bloodstain your album cover before it get wrapped. P-89 your mind, you won't forget that. Caught behind enemy lines, you gonna get clapped. On chase got shot in the face. Nine niggaz, broad to nothin, while the slug judged his fate. Shoulda got low 'steada tryna flossin his cake. Reaction was slow, reflexes way too late. These are warzone niggaz, home sweet home niggaz. Killers ain't afraid of nothin, it's on niggaz. M-14 your legs with one in your head. Put chumps to sleep, lay 'em in deathbed. [Chorus]. You get shot up. Go in the hood you not from. You get shot up. Twenty-two shots'll leave you numb. You get shot up. Startin the beef with no gun. You get shot up. Blah! You get shot up, blah!. You get shot up. Leavin wit' bitches after the club. You get shot up. Stuck at the light, sittin on dubs. You get shot up. Left for dead in your own blood. You get shot up. Blah! You get shot up. [Sticky Fingaz]. You never saw the nigga face that was holdin the glock. You just heard shots then the nigga next to you dropped. Til you seen blood you ain't even know you got popped. Felt your body temperature change from cold to hot. Left you for dead, you still alive, count your blessings. In the middle of the street holdin in your intestines. All they wanted was the money, you had to be dumb. Jumped for the gun, he blew off and punctured your lung. Your man came back and found you scrollin on the pavement. Grabbed you in his arms and said ""hold on son you gon' make it!"". Your vital signs droppin, your haloucinatin. ""Somebody call the ambulance!"" If you live it's amazing. One still in your stomach, two went through your chest. Your boy tellin you ""don't talk son, save your breath"". The more you walk to the light the more it's hurtin less. You gettin nautious from the smell of burnin flesh. Cryin to God, think he can hear you beg?. Tears in your eyes, screamin ""I can't feel my legs!"". You closer to death, paramedics pumpin your chest. Blowin you breath, you dyin but you under arrest. How it feel to see a man dead knowin you next. I guess that's what niggaz meant by blood in the x. Tryin to hang on but you gon' wish you was dead. Cause if you live the rest of your life it's in the feds. [Chorus]. You get shot up. Go in the hood you not from. You get shot up. Twenty-two shots'll leave you numb. You get shot up. Startin the beef with no gun. You get shot up. Blah! You get shot up, blah!. You get shot up. Leavin wit' bitches after the club. You get shot up. Stuck at the light, sittin on dubs. You get shot up. Left for dead in your own blood. You get shot up. Blah! You get shot up. You get shot up, you get shot up. You get shot up, you get shot up. You get shot up, you get shot up. You get shot up, you get shot up. You get shot up, you get shot up. You get shot up, you get shot up. You get shot up, you get shot up. You get shot up, you get shot up"
sister i'm sorry,"[Sticky Fingaz - Talking]. I think one right here.... Is long over due. All ya'll. All ya'll. [Sticky Fingaz]. To all my sisters all across the world. I applaud you. I know can't nothing can't erase the pain we caused you. I'm sorry sister for all the times we used you. Hurt you, beat you up, bad and abused you. Raped you, took your womanhood, violated you. Betrayed you, you women, we supposed to praise you. Instead we called you hoes and bitches and dissed you. I was thinking ""Damn, what if that was my mother or my sister?"". You never feel it, till it hits home. We abandoned you, left you all alone. With our babies in your hour of need. Left you all by yourself to raise our seed. And all the times we made you go wild in court. And had to fight us just to get child support. There is only a handful of us that handle our responsibility. I'm from a broken home; know this shit is killing me. How a man can make a woman a mother and a father. If men got it hard, then women got it harder. And I represent every man on earth when I say this:. Sister I'm sorry and I pray for your forgiveness. [Chorus- Choclatt]. Sister I'm sorry. For all the wrong I've done. Sister I'm sorry. I'm telling everyone. Sister I'm sorry. Nothing can change the past. Sister I'm sorry. Your forgiveness is all I ask. [Sticky Fingaz]. I broke a promise, cheated on you, lied to you. I ain't recognize the goddess that is the side of you. I know sorry ain't do it but my acts of faith. Made me overstay, hope it's not to late. But I don't understand is how we could hit our girl. And how we can bring a bastard kid in this world. I don't want my child being ashamed of me. Like ""Mommy, where's daddy?"" Wonder what became of me. Swear to life I don't know how ya'll made it all these years. Can't even look you in your eyes without mine filling with tears. You my sister, I respect and love you. You woman, men came from you. And he came from she. All men ain't the man that they claim to be. Sister I'm sorry, swear to god, please forgive me. [Chorus]. [Choclatt]. Sister, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. [Chorus] x2. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for hurting you. For mistreating you. For not loving you. I'm so sorry"

If you readin this, I'm probly dead by now. Probly ODed and put three in my head by now. I'm on the balcony alone, nobody here to stop me. I should film this and leave Banned From TV a copy. I'm sick of this world and everything that come wit it. Death, life, politics, religion, fuck all of it. Always feel the pain or I'm ignorin it. Could barely see the love but all we need more of it. Yeah right, like that's gonna happen. They workin on the next nuclear weapon. Niggaz still starvin, niggaz still robbin. It's no money that's when you have mo' problems. I wanted a son but that was the past. Cause to tell the truth I don't think this world gon' last. And I'm not a quitter nigga, I ain't givin up. I'm just ready to move on son, I had enough. [Chorus]. Live or die, it's my life. I may, I might, it's my time. rain or shine, it's my ?. So say goodbye, it's my life. [Sticky Fingaz]. I can't recall anything fore the age of five. Far back as I could remember, had the lazy eye. All the shit I been through and I stayed alive. But today feel like a good day to die. Felt it before but it's hard to say goodbye. Felt like I'm talkin to myself when I pray to the sky. Like they took my faith and created a lie. Don't try to talk me out of it, I made up my mind. I'm a man, I meant no cry for help. So I'ma have to start the revolution by myself. I'm losin it, too much goin on in my head. Statistically speakin, I'm supposed to be dead. Made a crew of wild niggaz goin to war for 'caine. Decorate the walls in ya building wit ya brain. Strugglin in the hood, I know too well. But why to get to heaven nigga gotta go through hell?. [Chorus]"

All excited over pussy, like it's somethin to sell. Yall dudes is geeks, yall really don't influence the streets. The streets influence the slang that you fluently speak. Confusin to me, tryna be somethin your not. When them slugs pop you the one duckin them shots. I go hard like them youngins that be huggin the block. I go hard like Humphrey wit a glove and a glock. I'm somethin ya not, quite frankly you could love it or not. Certified number one nigga up in your spot. [Chorus]. [Rio]. A'yo remember Candy? White too dope camry. Big booty wit the small panties. Used to smuggle yay' for the homie Randy. Got the plushed out crib off the water in Miami. She almost had me, I was gone off the fatty. In love wit the way she called me daddy. Had she, known about the city where I'm from. And I ain't goin home til my bankrole's done. Motherfucker's think pimpins for fun. I ain't done til my greenery's weighin a ton. And we could smoke big weed, just lay in the sun. Hellafied when we ride, weed makin me buzz. Let's hit the room right after the club. That's what I'm here for. [Chorus]"

what if i was white,"(feat. Eminem). [Eminem]. Yo I got an idea. Let me go grab Sticky right quick. [sounds of steps]. Hey yo Stick, Stick. [Sticky]. Yo Slim Shady. Yo I just had like a nightmah... Wait it wasn't like a nightmare. It was like a good dreah... Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?). Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?). Yo, yo I dreamt I was white! (Ohhh). [Chorus: Eminem]. If he was white. What if he was white?. What if he was white?. What - If - He - Was - White?. What if he was white?. What if he was. white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?. [Verse One: Sticky Fingaz]. Yo, yo. What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine?. Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang. I know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me. Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me. (Can I get your autograph?). The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me. I wouldn't need collateral to buy property. If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor. SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store. Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something). Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job. On my own land I feel like an immigrant. If I was white I wouldn't of thought O.J. was innocent (He did it). [Chorus: Eminem]. If I was white. What if he was white?. What if he was white? (Yo think about that). What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute). What if he was white?. What if he was (What if he was white?). white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?. (What if he was white?). What if he was white?. What if he was white?. What - If - He - Was - White?. What if you were white? (what if he was white?). What if he was. white, white, white, white, white (STICKyyyy what if you were white?). white, white, white, white, white?. [Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz]. If I was white. It would be a different world for me. If I was white (ummmmmmmm?) What shade would I be?. Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, preppy or high class?. YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!. In any case that be the ill shit right? (Yep). But there's a good and bad side of being white. You can't say the N word without startin a fight (What's up my nigger?). Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet. Even if I was white plaque still have a ghetto shit (How you doing?). Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!). If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock. and cover my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh). [Chorus: Eminem]. If he was white. What if he was white?. What if he was white? (What if he was white?). What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white. What if he was white?. What if he was. white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?. (What if he was white?). What if he was white?. What if he was white?. What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (ummmmmmmm?). What if he was white? (What if you were white?). What if he was. white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?. (What if he was white?). [Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz]. Yo, yo, yo, if I was white. I probably wouldn't even think the same. I'd watch Tennis and Golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man). Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday. If I was white. I couldn't live around my way. And there probably would of never even been an Onyx, shit. I be serice sippin vodka and tonix. Smokin on a marlboro instead of a Newport. Id live in Long Island instead of New York. If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk. cuz everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!). And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot. Cuz all of the dreads would think I'm a cop. [Chorus: Eminem]. If he was white. What if he was white?. What if he was white?. What - If - He - Was - White? (Yo you can't say that). What if he was white. What if he was. white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?. What if you were white?. What if he was white?. What - If - He - Was - White?. What if he was white?. What if he was. white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?. If he was white?. What if he was white?. What if he was white. (What would you do if you were white?). What - If - He - Was - White?. (What if you were white?). white, white, white, white, white, white,. (What if you were white!!!!). white, white, white, white?. What if he was white?. What if he was white?. white, white, white, white, white?. What if he was white. white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?. [Eminem]. Yo, what if I was white? Uhh.."

wonderful world,"Now a days it's easier to get a gun than a education. That's why kids in trench coats shoot up they schools. And parents out live they kids. And sex, the thing that bring life also take it away. When you say this is a wonderful world, ha-ha-ha-ha. [Sticky Fingaz]. I've seen red for green, dead soldiers too,. I've seen men killed could have been me or you,. And I think to myself. What a wonderful world. [Unknown Voice]. Yo, Yo World, Yo, The Time Is Runnin' Out. The Times Runnin' Out. [Sticky Fingaz]. I've seen guys if blue, seize pounds of white. The rich rule the day. The poor starve at night. And I think to myself. What are wonderful world. [Unknown Voice]. Yo, Yo World, Yo, The Time Is Runnin' Out. The Times Runnin' Out. [Sticky Fingaz]. The serpent & the angel so deadly in disguise. Are all kinds of races drop like flies,. I've seen friends making friends saying. Sayin' ""To Hell With you!"". Niggaz be jealous, hatin' on you. I've seen babies dyin'. Can't watch them grow. Brotha's at war, never get old. And I think to myself. What a wonderful world. Yessssss,. [Unknown Voice]. Yo, Yo World, Yo, The Time Is Runnin' Out. The Times Runnin' Out. [Sticky Fingaz]. I think to myself.
