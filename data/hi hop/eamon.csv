she has no time,You think your days are uneventful. And no one ever thinks about you. She goes her own way. She goes her own way. You think your days are ordinary. And no one ever thinks about you. But we're all the same. And she can hardly breathe without you. She says she has no time. For you now. She says she has no time. Think about the lonely people. Then think about the day she found you. Or lie to yourself. And see it all dissolve around you. She says she has no time. For you now. She says she has no time. For you now. She says she has no time. Lonely people tumble downwards. My heart opens up to you. When she says. She says she has no time. For you now. She says she has no time. For you now. She says she has no time

this is the last time,This is the last time. That I will say these words. I remember the first time. The first of many lies. Sweep it into the corner. Or hide it under the bed. Say these things they go away. But they never do. Something I wasn't sure of. But I was in the middle of. Something I forget now. But I've seen too little of. The last time. You fall on me for anything you like. Your one last line. You fall on me for anything you like. And years make everything alright. You fall on me for anything you like. And I no I don't mind. This is the last time. That I will show my face. One last tender lie. And then I'm out of this place. So tread it into the carpet. Or hide it under the stairs. Say that some things never die. Well I tried and I tried. Something I wasn't sure of. But I was in the middle of. Something I forget now. But I've seen too little of. The last time. You fall on me for anything you like. Your one last line. You fall on me for anything you like. And years make everything alright. You fall on me for anything you like. And I no I don't mind. The last time. You fall on me for anything you like. Your one last line. You fall on me for anything you like. And years make everything alright. You fall on me for anything you like. And I know I don't mind
untitled 1,A house on fire. A wall of stone. A door that once was open. An empty face and empty bones. Who ate your heart?. You're cold inside. You're not the one I hoped for. I'll see you on the other side. I'll see you on the other side. The wind wouldn't blow me home. To lie in your heart of hearts. Will I ever see you again. And lie in your heart of hearts. Who ate your heart?. You're cold inside. You're not the one I hoped for. I'll see you on the other side. I'll see you on the other side. The wind wouldn't blow me home. To lie in your heart of hearts. Will I ever see you again. And lie in your heart of hearts
we might as well be strangers,I don't know your face no more. Or feel your touch that I adore. I don't know your face no more. It's just a place I'm looking for. We might as well be strangers in another town. We might as well be living in a different world. We might as well. We might as well. We might as well. I don't know your thoughts these days. We're strangers in an empty space. I don't understand your heart. It's easier to be apart. We might as well be strangers in another town. We might as well be living in a another time. We might as well. We might as well. We might as well be strangers. Be strangers. For all I know of you now. For all I know of you now. For all I know of you now. For all I know
