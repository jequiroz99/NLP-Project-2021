Cooler than a peppermint, Wayne's World excellent. Party on Garth, shwing!, work ethic harder than a Mexican. That?s why I can walk up into any restaurant and close the whole thing. See, even G couldn't F with it. Semi colon dash parenthesis, text messaging. That?s a side smiley face 'cause I'mma make the best of it. I assume you should make room for the elephant. Boom, where I come from is irrelevant. 'Cause my glory is all that I revel in. And my story begins where most others end. So all I really got to tell ?em is. [Hook 2 2X]"

bitstu (dreams money can buy freestyle),"Yeah, fresh off tour nigga. I still smell like the van and shit. I was like, ""soon as we get into the studio. Load that jai paul joint up"". What it do, what it do?. Peas and carrots, I'm back in the stu, in the stu. Shouts to casey veggies, that's my dude. Finish touring, now I'm back up in the booth. Like superman 4, s on my chest and. Damn ho, he flexing. Hard in the paint, that's a van gogh erection. Head til I ache, x on excedrin. Niggas gonna hate, that's a fact, not a question.

What it do, what it do?. They want beef? Well, I'm back in the stu, in the stu. Like hangover 2 with a tyson tattoo. They want a new classic? Well, I'm writing that too. Money, cars, hoes, chains. Dope flows, females, wait?. They got no content and subject, fam, they emails blank. Paint a picture and tell whatever the details can't. Buildin' a movement, them haters making my retail wait. When they go on sale, put it on the scale. Praying that it do well, and weigh as much as blue whales. Dropping bars for all of them broads who bailed. Smoking that cool j, giving haters 2 l's. Perfect timing, I started popping with rhyming. I was close to getting a job at furniture on consignment. Tapping on the table and spinning around in a chair man. Now it's deals on the table with the chairman"

chaka shao khan,"It's these girls that be needy. Labels that be greedy. That keep me hitting these bottles hoping I find a genie. No shave november, hair growing out in my beanie. Benny the jet hit got chicks on my l7 weenie. Musical chair rhymes, they thinking it's there time. The game like lebron's hairline, always receding. All I'm needing is a little space. Once I get a little taste. You niggas should grab a chair, no triple h. Tech-neek you a fool for this!. This feels soulful, but powerful. Chaka shao khan!. Welcome to the city of pretty women that can't take the now. And cry enough to turn a small lake into the nile. Head's great, but they be a head case on file. With contraceptive pills she ain't take in a while. So I'm putting on a glove like oj in the trial. For me to calm down, it's gon' take a while. Vegas for the night we got drinks at tao. Like calvin in paid in full. We pop ace so wild. While, niggas who were hating all in our faces. 24 Hour diamonds, they all shapes and smiles. It was all hate til now. Now I'll take my bow, little hoes, weak little hoes. If this was 5th grade, I put put you in a figure 4. Used to keep a flag on us like pookie's clothes. Just a bunch of lost boys, bangorang, rufio. Chaka meet shao khan. And in my downtime, since weed is a trend now, I sell it by pounds signs. And still deliver classics through alpines. Squarians say, vizzy blowin' up? It's 'bout time"". And this just the beginning. You know how people say, ""this is my year""?. Naw, this is my generation. Vizzy. This is that chaka shao khan. Mortal kombat bangin on that loud tom. When I spit that blacka blacka blaow rhyme. Losing my mind even though I sound fine. 8 Blunts deep, think I'm about to be on cloud 9. Coupe changing colors, the new name is mood rings. Square in the circle, four eyes and 2 chains. Under the illest conditions, I'm winning: Flu game. Hashtag squarian, intergalactic crew name"
doo rag,"Yeah, J Dilla. You see this doo rag?. It represents everything I do bad. It represents the gang member shot up on the front. page news ad (damn). It's too bad. He wore a doo rag. So now when I wanna get my waves. people ask me if I'm in some gang. No I don't hustle. Maybe you would understand my struggle. if I wore a noose instead of this chain. It's sad that I can't just be me. Without you stereotyping me like an Mp3. I don't care if you are Kunta. Or Martin Luther King or even B. E. T. , you can't get me free. So with this simple piece of black cloth. Laying down my hair like grease, I'm mad lost (I don't get it). How did this become a symbol of a black man. out to do another man harm. You see this doo rag?. It represents everything I do bad. It's real talk. This black woman told me take off my rag. Cause I look like a hood, well that's too bad. Cause that's too simple for me. How the hell you justify a black cloth as a symbol of me. Your snake belly comments are that low. The same thing was said when the Black Panthers rocked afros. If it's a black thing. Or a hood thing. It's not viewed as a good thing and that's known. You see this doo rag?. It represents everything we do bad. Yeah. J-Dilla. Rest in Peace. Remember. Forever. Thanks for the Donuts"
#endoftheworld,"Let me in your life, let me in your homes. Let me in your stereos and get me in my zone. A hero on the page is what I wanna be the most. But if we follow for a follow, tell me who gon lead us both. Roman numeral flow, wallet full of C's. Turn numbers into the alphabet so I can count G's. The loser who won too like you was counting the 3. After the millions cause they doubted the dream. I ain't lost a thing in this grind but my mind. And reality so harsh how could dreaming waste my time. I just ask mine, hypothetical at times. Wonderin' if my rap minds matter after I flat line?. So I sign out of Facebook and get some real friends. Got off Twitter with niggas and set some real trends. And we gon' get it man while the World spins.

Is it the end of the World yet?. Followers followin', role models modellin'. Niggas throwin' they dollars in and everybody is hollerin. Is it the end of the world yet?. Is it the end of the World yet?. Young and invincible, hated by all the principles. Maybe cause all our principles would seem so fictional. Now we live in a world that's so digital. Hashtags at the minimal, niggas act like it's biblical. Typical I watch niggas that's at they pinnacle. And not have one event that felt pivotal. When I was young I was wylin' but always had drive. They suspended my license and then I got fly. Who gon' change the World, not I. But I will influence the mind that does try. That's a Pac line, see how it all goes. We could become a leader after you follow. So sign out of Facebook and get some real friends. Get off Twitter my nigga and set some real trends. And we gon get it while the world spins.

I guess there are some shit that I'll spit that I never get to show. Over they heads I go. I wrote this on a flight next to this women that was white. She asked me what is that you write, I said a rap song. She said: ""really, with sentences that long"". If you think rap is just drugs and gats then you dead wrong. This is the paper my sons college fund is made on. Those college kids at shows in the front row with weight on. We change lives with these lines that they hate on. Spit on tracks like simple jack and then kick back like Fei Long. I just want write something that make you get life from it. It's more than just a facebook, like or dislike button. So sign out of that and get some real friends. Get off Twitter my nigga and set some real trends"

fall out the sky,"[Verse 1: XV]. I know I'm the shit, tell 'em they gonna say it. I know I can spit, tell ?em they gonna spray it. I be sitting, writing piff and the metaphor's thick. I'm like that line is hella dope, ain't it?. And two minutes after that, I'm looking back at the rap. Telling Pat that I won't play it even when I know I wanna take it. I'm Neo trying to jump in the matrix, won't make it. Wish you could see it through my eyelids. When I'm playing my shit, everybody silent.

And that's when I hear Hoff, I knew that was you,. please sign my arm. Square in the Circle's all I bump in my car,. that's when it gets hard. To not feel like a star when they know who you are,. I stay modest. And honestly, I'm appalled that I've gotten this far. on the shit that I'm on. [Hook]. I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky. And then I fall right out the sky, I know sometimes I feel so high. And then I fall right out the sky and then I fall right out the sky. [Verse 2: XV]. She say I'm cute, she say I'm cool. To all of her friends, I make my move. I'm feeling like I'm that dude, don't gotta spit game. I'm already that smooth, I leave my pessimism in the stands. As soon as I shoot, my conscious yell boo. As soon as I walk up to talk all of my stuff, I honestly can't move. That's my insecurity like a mall cop. But I'm trying to leave with something like a car lot. Pick one, pick two but they all hot and I'm trying to get you. up to my spot. She know my name, she trying to play it off. I seen that ring, she trying to take it off. And I wanna approach but my thoughts ain't helping me flow. [Hook 2]. I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky. And then I fall right out the sky, I know sometimes I feel so high. And then I fall right out the sky and then I fall right out the sky. I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky. And then I fall right out the sky. [Verse 3: XV]. I know they telling me how I'm mad dope. Star Wars XV, I'm the last hope but I hear them keys. And I just say please, don't end on a bad note. And that's probably why I tip-toe, champagne, say toast. And then I sip slow, trying to get they attention and then I get no's. And then I get known just to make them stop and go. This is all I got, no trust fund so don't shoot me as I fly, duck hunt. Everything I expect, I accept and every dude that I pay, I collect. And everything that I say I'mma get, I'mma get. Take a trip, pick a floss on my ex, yeah for a minute, I was high.

hoop dreams,"I’m talkin’ ’bout hoop dreams, hoop dreams. My nigga had hoop dreams, hoop dreams. Some niggas ball, some niggas shoot. When you from where I’m from, everybody wanna hoop. I’m talkin’ ’bout. Dwayne Wayne to Dwayne Wade, fire on him. So hatin’ niggas that ain’t paid put fire on him. But he was Usa, Jordan, nine on him. The old heads he used to hoop with even tried to warn him. Not everbody gets those dreams. Even Ewing didn’t get no ring. We see the beamers drive by and some guys won’t get those keys. But we pray that Jesus shutters when we hit them threes. And I will choose to this crew and move keys fast. But he passed like Steve Nash. ‘Til the day that he need cash. Then he has to start to say. Move dimes easy or make pennies the harder way. Like get a job today. He says that’s too boring. I’m to broke to pay attention. I’m getting what I’m affording. And girls watch from the floor and recognize him from scoring. And rims on twenty-threes, now he’s the new Jordan. With his. Carry heat like Alonzo. A nine like you Rondo. Then you hit the block, Dikembe Mutombo. Flew to the top fast, now you gotta drive slow. Yao Ming out in Houston with yo eyes low. You shooting for racks on racks. Got dreams to be Kareem, then match the stats. I’m talking Bill Russell rings, back to back. No Toronto, but some niggas just rap the rap. Cause everybody can’t ball and that’s a fact. But I came with the Magic, Shaq attack. My Og told me, victory’s so sweet. But not everything, that’s a Phil Jackson chat. I’m talkin’ Bulls verse Jazz, I captured that. Cause I take all of the glory these Caps could cap. Uh, my dudes lost, still out there shooting. Funny thing is none of them were hooping. But they had. Because the streets is a short stop:. Either you’re slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot. Because the streets is a short stop:. Either you’re slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot"
more millions,"So many people rapped over ""a milli"". But I'm trying to get more millions, right jay?. One a million, 2 a million, 3 a million, 4. I'll rap on it, you'll rap on it, we'll rap on it: Go!. All these rappers, call them rappers, all they do is flow. Words together, heard they're better out there slangin coke. That said, and I wouldn't wish that even on my folk. I'm a get this money and go, then I'm leaving on my own. Cause I'm ashing at the rap game in these rap planes. Thinking they gonna be the next biggie and 2pac mayne. All you need is that beat with that flow and that chain. I was having a lot more fun with my atari and pac mayne. Don't make me remind you what rap is: I smack kids. Niggas know I drop beats like jack did when rap is a spectacle. Like when it's scored in mexico, $2 a gallon texaco. Like obama winning the election yo!. That's muthafuckin unreal! I want more millions than weezy and. More o's than jeezy and more clothes than yeezy. And I hope that you believe me. Cause the big homie bounced and said ""get in xv's weight"". I put red on their head like ronald weasley. Ain't nobody stopping, losing's not an option.

I ain't gonna cheat y'all and I ain't gonna be hard. I like bars, I like dudes that's in the geek squad. Come and fix your ethernet, promise that I'll leave her wet. With a faster connection, an erection [?]. Are all nerds as good as you? I tell her yes. Cause nerds do everything they do, well the best. New album on the way: Tell em shelve the rest. I'm thinking how many people should be yelling x?. ""One million, 2 million, 3 million 4! "". Put me on the mtv buzzed and they gonna tell me ""next! "". Cause I'm the next, fuck it I'm the best!. Muthafucka I'm I'll! Now drop it"
phobia,"Yeah, do I want this bad as I think that I want it?. Posters on the wall, you'd think that I'm wanted. Jessie James style, living without laws.

So til I am a Billboard charter. Record label Martyr. Hold my bottle in July for sparklers. Going from 500 comments online to hit the club fresh. And nobody comment on mine, I won't lie. Sometimes it kills to dream. But even Superman gets hurt by the green. But what I'm scared of is getting hits like a fiend. And then being high and it's not what it seems. Damn. What are you afraid of?. Afraid of, afraid of. What are you afraid of?. Nothing but you. What are you afraid of?. Afraid of, afraid of. What are you afraid of?. Nothing but you. Yeah, baby I'm your boogie-man. She said Maybe we should be friends. Maybe we should be then. If that's all it takes for us to break. You could be my Rose but you chose to be the Vase. She said I froze when she said ""Let's get a place! "". Like commitment is what I'm scared to make. She don't gotta go and look my mom in the face. With three marriages that she views as mistakes. Wait, you'll never be that to me. Hope you know that in case you ever come back to me. I know sometimes these 16's are just raps to me. But me and your love grew so rapidly. I still see you sleeping in the bed with your back to me. How did our ""forever after"" not end happily?. Actually, I guess it's not goodbye. You can't open your eyes, baby. We ain't even high. What are you afraid of?. Afraid of, afraid of. What are you afraid of?. Nothing but you. What are you afraid of?. Afraid of, afraid of. What are you afraid of?. Nothing but you. Counting my blessings watching Inception. Feeling like my dreams come true like the totem fell over. 'Fore the credits started rolling. But these are just previews, it all would come soon. I'm just living in it, like front rooms. Cause any minute it all could conclude. Chasing the high like running on blunt fumes. Came from the underground, creature from the Lagoon. She's so amazed by this life I live. But I cannot stay, one night to give. And I hate to say that I hit it and quit. But in the back of my mind I know she thinks that I did. And it kills me, tryna put my all into it. All those Bbms you sent. Have an ""R"" next to it. 143's turn to Omg's - Ttyl, my flights about to leave. I know. What are you afraid of?. Afraid of, afraid of. What are you afraid of?. Nothing but you. What are you afraid of?. Afraid of, afraid of. What are you afraid of?. Nothing but you"

Would've thought niggas been learned. Comin' out the city where the wind turn. Where our OGs haven't told me if you hold heat you might get burned. So I kept one inside my dresser. Cause you never know if one might test ya. Under the right pressure them killas squeeze. And thought you sneezed, God bless ya. God bless us, killed the game now damn you. I didn't have to shout where I'm from. But I still tote like I wear boots. Ladies gettin' their hair cute, L7s in the air too. Now I'm just multiplying myself, call that a square root.

Kids want my career and I tell 'em ""love it or hate it"". Put fame on a scale and you'll be glad that you weighed it. When miracles get credited to elitists and sadists. At 27 just praying, you here, happy belated. Middle fingers whenever you take pictures. When life gives you lemons, use it to chase liquor. Consumption's our destruction if you figure. There's a whole generation full of wild little niggas sayin'. Jones, Hendrix, Joplin, Cobain. Sex, money, liquor, cocaine. Rock, Roll, Peace, Love. Now welcome to the 27 club"
the dark horse (dark fantasy freestyle),"Can we get much higher? So high oh. Can we get much higher? So high oh. Can we get much higher? So high oh. Can we get much higher? So high oh. They telling vizzy to kill it but that's obvious. Ace or jesse ventura, either way, I'm gon body it. Niggas play cool and jump the shark on some fonzie shit. Crazy, my hustle from just being po' got me rich. Paid in full bitch, slick rick, joreon. I killed the web hit safari with the google chrome. And every track user share is media fire. Who that dude killing the venue, and is he for hire?. Yup, you can ask mr. Macent that. That's why I be on planes like the state I rep. Little niggas on blogs try to hate on x. But they ain't got the kevin hart to say with they chest nigga. So fuck that hater, one man rap laker. One hand behind the back, lay up on these half players. That nigga on rap radar is a rap raider. Feeling like wiz on his last papers saying. Can we get much higher? Oh. Is this what we doing tonight? Yeah, I think we winning. Like coming home from the dentist, I just got a filling. Where making it is the hero, being broke is the villain. Clouds are the ground and the moon is the ceiling. Victory is close, the question is will I wait? Why?. When I catch her like a predator on dateline. I'm like a bust when I bust, I don't waste lines. 'Cause there's a world outside I'm trying to make mine. Drop an album, win a grammy, put my boys on. Then I roll with the dough on a croissant. Big house in japan with a koi pond. Doing this is double o, you just a decoy bond. The black daniel craig throw you off the ledge. Now I'm drinking your juice and eating your scrambled eggs. The whole crowd standing like the morning pledge. Saying I'm the best like morning head yeah. 'Cause what they do in they first 48, I do in 12. Somebody call the first 48, this shit is killed. Put me in leagues of ivy like I went to yale. With tales that the less lyrical niggas couldn't tell. Y'all must be after l's like pollo loco. Put the game in chokehold, stun your day like stone cold. Out in japan with a bad chick rocking kimonos. She all up in my linen and I ain't talking yoko. Rosetta stone, I get eight in every language like ocho. I'm just way too vocal for these rap locals. But I'm a break the door down with the right force. Make way for the white knight, dark horse"
the kick,"Countin' my blessings, watchin' Inception. But I'm livin one of those scenes. Where everyone knows it ain't real except him. They can't convince him to believe. I know this life with all the lights and how it ain't true. But fuck it, I don't want to leave. Cause you can never have deja vu. If you don't ever dream. Successful stories never told to us. Trying to make ends cause we never got what was owed to us. School never grown on us, Pops never shown on us. Open Sesame, see? The street never closed on us. Moved white and didn't see much green like a ski slope. Now I see so much green that I could be Hulk. And people think I relocated on the East Coast. But I still hold it down in the town I speak for. Towing my city behind me like it was repoed. In a game full of sharks but there ain't no cheat codes. XV can take a hike, I'm Tim Tebow. Matrix Reload, face it, he cold. Rep the 316 I'm 7 30 in the mind. I'm that dude hands down, 6 30 when I rhyme. I'm a 235, always in my prime. And it's 4.15, meaning it's my time. Was I a nerd cause niggas acted like dim wits. Or was I truly just gifted in academics. Figured that with these lyrics that I was rapping like Christmas. I could number 2 on all of the doubters up on my shitlist. Pissed my little brother has to miss this. Told my momma she'll never watch from the sofa. Tell my haters, hit record on they remote controllers. Until til my totem falls over. [Hook]. This is the life that I never will forget. I'm inside a dream that I never wanna quit. So I'm just sittin back, waiting for the kick. I'm just sittin back, waiting for the kick. This is the life that I never will forget. I'm inside a dream that I never wanna quit. So I'm just sittin back, waiting for the kick. I'm just sittin back, waiting for the kick. Wait for it…. [Verse 2 - XV]. Lord can I change my life with these sentences. When I got boys doing life cause of sentencing. I'm dealing with it every night, thats what penance is. Balled like Bruce Willis but Die Hard With A Vengeance kid. And I'm in this party where all these women is. Tryna find where niggas with dollar bills and Benzes is. Finally left what I wanted for what I needed. Can't be the girl of my dreams if you don't close your eyes to see it. The road less travelled, where both of us were headed. Said it would kill us, I told you I won't let it. When my life was plain, most bitches jetted. You said boy I've been down like toe touch stretches. I even set expectations and you never ever met it. But I gave you my heart you ain't even call a medic. Now she telling me to leave her alone. But I can't like she got bad credit. I guess it's debted with me and you both have left it. In eternal sunshine but my spotless mind won't forget it. So I accept it and pray no-one intercept it. Given the globe my soul and hope everybody accept it. Making it is never what you expected. I told my girl she'll never watch from the sofa. Tell my haters hit record on they remote controllers. Until my totem falls over. [Hook]"

When they saw me dropping shit in detail like easel. Man I’m on fire this that Denzel, don’t inhale. Jordan form the free throw, Dominique Wilkins windmill.

what's eating gilbert grape,"I swore that I'd stop. Tryin to figure out what's wrong with hip-hop. After soulja boy dropped. And everybody thought there was a diss to mims. Oh well, cause what the hell happened to him. I worked years on a record. And rappers all-of-a-sudden started comin. Droppin songs they come up with in a second. The radio plays it til the public done had enough. Of it and needs somethin even dumber to replace it. The quota hip-hop emcees are just as sad. Metros' dressings retro it's just a fad. Kanye might not be gay but y'all dressed like fags. Tryin to be him and express, but man poppin some tags. I hate the fact that I sound just as mad. As an abusive dad who's kids bedroom is trashed. And I admit for a sec I was on the fence. Cause that padded room got hot so I had to vent. I miss the days where a rapper had to have some cents. Before they even saw a dolla, imagine it. I don't mean rappers that rap about laba-rynths. And apart tires, and all kinds of bad-ass shit. What happened to freestylin in the park til it's dark. Paintin pictures from finish to start like it's an art. Now all I see on 106th and park is dumb dances. And rappers that'd I'd rather hear bark. That's all I hear when these mufuckas rhyme. And can't believe y'all got this mufucka signed. Here we go everyone's a rapper like hand me flows. When you know you wanna get a spin on the merry-go. I don't care if you were 12 years old and priest saw. Your rear-view even he wouldn't feel you. People tell me fuck it x, you can get a deal too. Just make one of them songs to make em all hear you. Then drop an album showcasing the real you. And that's what all these new young rappers that get deals do. Niggas don't even spit that raw anymore. They don't know a break from a kit-kat bar. They don't know the difference between a classic and a hoopty. And half they lives is outta a martin scorsese movie. And fans shake they head in agreement with what I said. When they ringtone is prolly snap ya finga, shake ya leg. We gotta put an end to the bullshit, indebted. I said it. And every single word, yep, I meant it. Does it take a t-pain feature for y'all to get it. Download my mp3 and not a snippet. Make all my concerts free to get a ticket. And you can quote me on all of these lyrics. And now you hear it. So what's eating gilbert grape?. The fact that I'm filled with hate that makes a nigga feel this way. Or maybe cause I gotta deal with hate, from niggas. I don't know, I could get killed today. See I went against the wind and I'm into they own alley. So that's kinda tough when you in this state. So while everybody was trappin, and bustin they macs. I was opening the window, like william gates. My album complex did amazin things for my city. Alienated me from all the cats that ain't worked with me. I charge four-sixteen and niggas like who is he. But hustlers know time is money, and I gets busy. So when niggas try to diss me I just laugh it out. Cause I don't think they even know what they mad about. Like local cats become rappers and of course they wanna battle. So I'm the default nigga they rap about. Oh my, I got bigger things to do. So I don't got time to sit and hate on yo mans. No lie, my money tight like a jew. So why would I concentrate on yo camp. I came from the bottom to the top with a hand. Without craig and the power 93 band. Told em mamma's gone and they said I'd never be one. Payback's a bitch though I just want a refund. You were from the stars while bars just wanna see one, and need one. And have a baby mob on the key one. Sometimes I ask myself, what's the reasons?. That I wanna be part of this game and what it's become. And that's the question that I dance around to. And maybe on my album I'll have an answer for you. But til then I'mas keep dancing and snappin, smilin and rappin. And just wait and see what happens"
when we're done,"[Hook x2]. Not everybody lives, but everybody dies. So while a nigga here, I'm shooting for the sky. Landing on the moon, walking on the sun. Taking over the game, give it back when we done. [Verse 1]. Uh, 10 Thousand hands in the air, have you ever seen. Work 9 to 5 or 5 to 9, do you ever dream?. They in the red, but my stock is green. Proud like I've reached the clouds, all off a bean. Dreams on lucid, films on Lucas. Sound on surround and the crowd on stupid. Who that chick Dion, that's Dionne on Clueless. You circlin' around the money, sittin' in a cubicle. Field of Dreams, they said I'm too corny. Funny I got they ears all on me. Fears all gone and my peers all wrong. So keep your 2 cents in every phrase y'all coining. That's just common sense, all the hate I honored it. I don't leap, I quantum it. I don't answer, I problem it. I just drop shit, while they askin' where the colonic is. Pinky, you know what I'm pondering?. [Hook]. [Verse 2]. They said I smile too much to be a a-hole. And these girls is too much for me to take home. Bad as Beyonce, could be a fiance. But, she way too horny to have a halo. And these niggas ain't on me like I'm a J.Cole. More work for me, just more persons to see. That one day that kid out of Kansas could be a J Hov. Cut 'em slack cause same cats said not to rap. I'm overly optimistic, maybe a dream chaser. After some things that I've seen on screensaver. Turn a lions' den into a king's lair. No wonder they say “Vizzy where you've been player?”. Where the wild things are and the kids wear crowns. When we don't eat supper, we just tear that bitch down. Said we was grounded, but we far from the ground. Crossed all our T's dotted I's on the clouds, now. [Hook]. [Break x2]. Hands in the air we reaching for somethin', believing in nothin'. But fuck it man, we want everything. Uh-huh, we want everything. Uh-huh, we want everything. [Hook]"
willy wonkavator (blow up freestyle),"Look at the beats that I done buried. Tell me I can't bless this like five hail mary's. Dead is so grateful that I'm a have to tell jerry. Clearly, I'm still going unaware of the unwary. Yeah, haters stay imaginary as five fairies in the library. Eating on snozzberries, say, I rarely got the city on my back. You lisa simpson niggas need to get off my saxs. I rep that deuce one. Blackjack. Riding and I'm lifting up my hood like a hatchback. Whipping in my hot wheel, ain't riding on no snap track. I'm after slum dog millions, you after kat stacks. Better wear a condom and a hazmat. Bitches waste my time I wouldn't give 'em in a flashback. Rappers fill they flash drives with whack tracks. Couldn't break a record with a glass plaque. Motherfucker, that's that, I bag hunnies like mcm nigga. Championship ballin like wimbledon nigga. The dudes that talk big, I never envy them niggas. They been lying since forever like mgm nigga. It's hard to quit the bull, they be on some jordan shit. 'Cause when you really do it, you don't choose it, you were born in it. So I do it for my fam and you, florida shit. And I'm a kill a nigga on some dexter morgan shit. I promise mama that college just wasn't for the kid. 'Cause I'm after the trophies you don't box up in storages. Nobody ever sing my praises. Amazing now I'm hopping up on stages where. They all singing my choruses. Said fuck a job, now all I do is fucking work. Like a naughty secretary or a slutty nurse. Got the last laugh on people who acted funny first. Hungry like the homeless but I never spit a bummy verse. Signed with warner, now I got that bugs bunny smirk. What up doc? Seven's spock and I'm a younger kirk. Stay with hard lines like a modern warfare perk. And always throwing up my city until my tummy hurt. Dynamite life, let's have a blast all over these bars, put it on my tab. Gunning for the roses and I'm strumming like slash. I don't toot my own horn, I brought the whole brass. Put my bars on the graph, everything's proportion. 'Cause I never spit no trash, these are worth a fortune. 'Cause niggas throw me ass cap, they need aflac. Conceited about my good tracks, I always get a bad rap. I plot my winds just like it to wear a gas mask. And my gear is high end like giraffe ass. I'm after that dollar, almost four quarters. And warner's about to put me in the last half. Now watch they stock just go up. Your album dropping soon, tell em hold up. Vizzy lifting drinks, tell em pour up. My willy wonkavator bout to go up"
