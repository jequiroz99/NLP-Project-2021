Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me. First we were friends then became lovers. You was more than my girl, we was like brothers. All night we would play fight under covers. Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna. But every time I think about your pretty smile. And how we used to drive the whole city wild. Damn I wish you would've had my child. A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style. This shit is wild. All damn days that I reminisce. About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips. But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this. I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss. I love you, yeah. [Chorus: Usher]. I need a girl to ride, ride, ride. I need a girl to be my wife. I need a girl who's mine all mine.

breakdown,"Break, break down, steady breakin' me on down. Break, break down, steady breakin' me on down. Break, break down, steady breakin' me on down. Break, break down, steady breakin' me on down. You called yesterday to basically say. That you care for me but that you're just not in love. Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly. And led you to believe I was O.K.. To just walk away from the one thing. That's unyielding and sacred to me. [Chorus:]. Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it. And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you. But in reality I'm slowly losing my my mind. Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside. Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly. 'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering. So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night. And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry. So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to. Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue. Of the pain that rejection is putting you through. Do you cling to your pride and sing ""I will survive"". Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way"". Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away. [Chorus]. Yeah, c'mon. Yeah, c'mon, c'mon. Break break down. Gotta get control. Roll roll roll along. Steady breakin' me on down. Roll roll roll along. Break break down. Gotta get control. Roll roll roll along. Steady breakin' me on down. Roll roll along. It'll break you down. Only if you let it. Everyday crucial situation wrackin' my mind. Tryin' to break me down. But I won't let it. Forget it. Forget it. I've been feelin' like you're breakin' me down. Kickin' me around. Stressin' me out. I think I better go and get out and let me. Release some stress (stress). Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain). Hoping for the sun. But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain). Oh, i just wanna maintain. Yeah, when you feel the pressure's on. But nevertheless. Krayzie won't fall. It's over. It's endin' here, here. [Chorus]"

fooling around,"I know I vowed to never do this again but I. I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at. Got something that you need to know. You're the realest s*** I never wrote.

hush,"Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home. His life is like a video, the only reality he knows. He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car. Cruising up the boulevard. Driving pass people living hard. Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war. He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor. He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think its genocide. **That millions die from three lethal letters. He does shit to make it better. **And I'm thinking of you. [Chorus]. Everybody wants to touch the sky. Nobody wants to reach back. For the ones who are scared to fly. Everybody wants heaven. If you don't want to sacrifice. Don't say nothing, don't say nothing. Ooo-Hush. Don't say nothing. Ooo-Hush. Don't say nothing. [Verse 2]. She watches television full of fabricated show. Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh little does she know. That there is a real life drama happening right outside her door. 'Cause She continues to ignore, but she's like the Tv - the story repeats. She's searching through the channels. Skipping pass the news, she's more entertained by lies and gossip. 'Cause it hurts to see the truth. She complains about the nation. Think it's a waste of time to vote. She says the one that has been corrupted forever. No one tries to make it better. **And I'm thinking who. [Chorus]. Everyone wants to touch the sky (Oh-ho). Nobody wants to reach back. For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly). Everybody wants heaven (Heaven). If you don't want to sacrifice (Oh). Don't say nothing, don't say nothing. Ooo-Hush.

i love you too,"My first time I cried. You were incredible, took my breath away. I remember first time. Your eyes met mine. I saw a lot of me in you. That day I vowed to do my best. To try and teach you right when you're wrong. But you gotta live out your lessons. Time makes it all right. Watch you grow, you think you know. But I know better cos I been there, seen that, did it. How you think you got it. My gift for life is seeing the smile on your face. That's when all of my troubles melt away. Holding you in my arms. Makes the world feel like a better place. You say I love you,. Well I say that I love you too. I love you, I love you, you too I do. My second time around. Man this is crazy incredible. To feel something like this again is so remarkable. Big bright eyes, little lips,. With daddy's attitude. So I know the biggest job ahead of me. Is doing my best to try and teach you. Right when you're wrong. But you gotta live out your lessons. Time makes it all right. Watch you grow, you think you know. I know better cos I been there, seen that, did it. How you think you got it. My gift for life is seeing the smile on your face. That's when all of my troubles melt away. Holding you in my arms. Makes the world feel like a better place. You say I love you, well I say that I love you too. Life ain't a perfect story.

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone. I got it all, but I really need a wife at home. I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone. I got a few, you would like to bone. But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy. Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be. I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family. Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause. Most of these girls be confusing me. I don't know if they really love me or they using me. maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me. Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me. That's why I need a girl that be true to me. Know bout the game, and know how to do to me. Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me. Forget the word, it's just you and me. [P. Diddy & Usher]. Now let's ride...... [Chorus: Usher]. I need a girl to ride, ride, ride. I need a girl to be my wife. I need a girl who's mine all mine.

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime. But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind. I done had pretty chicks with all the right features. And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers. Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya. You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya. I find a girl, I'ma keep her. Cuz now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper. I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with. I need somebody I can build with. I need somebody I can hold tight. With the time and no full limits, no right. Anytime we together would feel so right. You the girl I been looking for my whole life. God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight. because of you girl, now I understand life. [Loon & Usher]. I need a girl.... [Chorus: Usher]. I need a girl to ride, ride, ride.

I need a girl in my life. [P. Diddy]. I had a girl that would've died for me. Didnæ?° appreciate her so I made her cry for me. Every night she had tears in her eyes for me. Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me. First we were friends then became lovers. You was more than my girl, we was like brothers. All night we would play fight under covers. Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna. But every time I think about your pretty smile. And how we used to drive the whole city wild. Damn I wish you would've had my child. A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style. This shit is wild. All damn days that I reminisce. About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips. But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this. I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss. I love you, yeah. [Chorus: Usher]. I need a girl to ride, ride, ride. I need a girl to be my wife. I need a girl who's mine all mine. I need a girl in my life. I need a girl to ride, ride, ride. I need a girl to be my wife. Nobody else cuz she's all mine. I need a girl in my life. (Chorus 4times). (Usher).

Now men have travelled this road many times before. All these stops signs I be have ignored. I can almost taste her, wish I could erase her. Fence after fence, wall after wall. I huff and I puff, hopin that she falls. It's either give her something or give nothing at all. I really wanna quit but her girl is the shit. She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin. You asked for her number but she slipped and gave you hers. She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin. Everytime I go to pitch, she throws me curves. She's blockin, block-blockin, block-blockin, blockin. Block-blockin, block-blockin. She's blockin, blockin, blockin, blockin"
breakdown,"Break, break down, steady breakin' me on down. Break, break down, steady breakin' me on down. Break, break down, steady breakin' me on down. Break, break down, steady breakin' me on down. You called yesterday to basically say. That you care for me but that you're just not in love. Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly. And led you to believe I was O.K.. To just walk away from the one thing. That's unyielding and sacred to me. [Chorus:]. Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it. And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you. But in reality I'm slowly losing my my mind. Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside. Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly. 'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering. So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night. And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry. So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to. Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue. Of the pain that rejection is putting you through. Do you cling to your pride and sing ""I will survive"". Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way"". Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away. [Chorus]. Yeah, c'mon. Yeah, c'mon, c'mon. Break break down. Gotta get control. Roll roll roll along. Steady breakin' me on down. Roll roll roll along. Break break down. Gotta get control. Roll roll roll along. Steady breakin' me on down. Roll roll along. It'll break you down. Only if you let it. Everyday crucial situation wrackin' my mind. Tryin' to break me down. But I won't let it. Forget it. Forget it. I've been feelin' like you're breakin' me down. Kickin' me around. Stressin' me out. I think I better go and get out and let me. Release some stress (stress). Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain). Hoping for the sun. But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain). Oh, i just wanna maintain. Yeah, when you feel the pressure's on. But nevertheless. Krayzie won't fall. It's over. It's endin' here, here. [Chorus]"

hush,"Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home. His life is like a video, the only reality he knows. He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car. Cruising up the boulevard. Driving pass people living hard. Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war. He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor. He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think its genocide. **That millions die from three lethal letters. He does shit to make it better. **And I'm thinking of you. [Chorus].

And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers. Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya. You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya. I find a girl, I'ma keep her. Cuz now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper. I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with. I need somebody I can build with. I need somebody I can hold tight. With the time and no full limits, no right. Anytime we together would feel so right. You the girl I been looking for my whole life. God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight. because of you girl, now I understand life. [Loon & Usher]. I need a girl.... [Chorus: Usher]. I need a girl to ride, ride, ride.

I need a girl in my life. [P. Diddy]. I had a girl that would've died for me. Didnæ?° appreciate her so I made her cry for me. Every night she had tears in her eyes for me. Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me. First we were friends then became lovers. You was more than my girl, we was like brothers. All night we would play fight under covers. Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna. But every time I think about your pretty smile. And how we used to drive the whole city wild. Damn I wish you would've had my child. A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style. This shit is wild. All damn days that I reminisce. About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips. But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this. I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss. I love you, yeah. [Chorus: Usher]. I need a girl to ride, ride, ride. I need a girl to be my wife. I need a girl who's mine all mine.

rest of my life,"If you live for something. You're not alone, my friend. So fill up your cup and lift your lighter. And toast to life. They say what don't kill me can make me stronger. So two drinks at night should help me live longer. I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test. Cause why tic toc to life. To arrive safely at death. I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a road. Sometimes I gotta close my eyes. Just to open my soul. And tonight is the night. I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool. So if you go fix some drinks. Me and usher are about to break some rules. Got somewhere to go but the world is moving slow. I was born for the fast life. I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford. But for what it's worth I'm ready to play. For the rest of my life. For the rest of my life. For the rest of my life. If I got one life to live, I'mma party til I'm dead. What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge. Tryna keep my balance I'm twisted so just in case I fall. Ring on my tomb, don't you say women, weed and alcohol. Got somewhere to go but the world is moving slow. I was born for the fast life. I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford. But for what it's worth I'm ready to play. For the rest of my life. For the rest of my life. If you live for something. You're not alone, my friend. So fill up your cup, lift your light up. And toast to life. I'm stuck in this moment. Freeze the hands of time. Cause I feel inner peace. When I'm out of my mind. And you can call me crazy. But I like to roll the dice. So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy. For the rest of my life. For the rest of my life. For the rest of my life"

Im gunna give shorty what she want!. Seduction. [Chorus]. [Repeat 3x]"

If love was a fire then we have lost the spark. Love never felt so cold. If love was a light then we're lost in the dark. Left with no one to hold. If love was a sport, we're not on the same team. U and I are destined to lose. If love was an ocean, baby, we are just a stream. 'cause love isn't for me and u. So why don't you go your way, and I'll go mine. Live ur life and I'll live mine. Baby, u'll do well and I'll be fine. 'cause we're better of seperated.... Girl, I know we had some good times. Sept for now, gotta say goodbye. Girl u know I love u I can't deny. Can't say we didn't try. to make it work for u and I. I know it hurts so much But it's best for us. Somewhere along thiswide new moon,. we lost the trust. So I walk away, so u don't have to see me cry. It's killing me so, why don't u go. So why don't you go your way, and I'll go mine. Live ur life and I'll live mine. Baby, u'll do well and I'll be fine. 'cause we're better of seperated..."
