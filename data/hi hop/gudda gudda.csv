always love you (feat. nicki minaj),"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]. Once upon a time there lived the Harajuku Barbie. Use to watch the game in madison square garden. Coliseum block on the weekend Italian. Icces from the Puerto Ricans. She reps Queens like a crown or a real poofy gown. Or the little white lady out in London. Weeds bridge far rock, southside Jamacia block. Flat-Bush Brooklyn, all of them Jamacian spots. This is my city and I be reppin my city. It's where the giants will tackle you, call a capital avalon. If you come to my city u might see what I mean. It's the city that never sleeps but it's the city of dreams. [Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]. What up uptown, downtown, 6th ward. 7th ward, hardheads, west bank, 5th ward. 3rd ward, 10th ward, reppin every damn street. Shout out the mighty nine and east 2 Mazant St. Rest in peace son he had Tyra Lan. On lockdown, it's a shame they took him out the game. I see ya CeCe, Nacho, FiFi. Snag Gang, Chuck D, Tallee, T-Streets. That's them Garetti boys, all about the fetti boy. Only think broke 'round here is the levee boy. You know my city nigga, yeah it's real hood. Talk to Turk other day, he doin real good. Hold ya head C, hold ya head mack. Rest in peace Soulja, damn we need You back. Shout out B. G. , the whole Chopper City. Cash Money, Young Money, yeah we got the city. [Verse 3: Short Dawg]. Yeah, now lets welcome the Katrina victims. I wasn't there when it happen, but I seen the pictures. So anything my niggas need they can call Short. My arms always opened like Walmart. I moved to the A and promised I'mma be back. I'm still #1 in Houston like T-Mac. Check my sleeve tats, I know you see that. H with a star, syrup pourin over green back. Yeah, and I ain't talking Ms. Buttersworth. So pass me a styrofoam double cup at first. And I'mma pour a four up in that. And sip it till you see me movin slow like I'm fat. This the home of the the candy painted doors on the 'lac. And voices sounding deep as baratone on the track. (Awready) Yeah, we call that screwed. And if u movin too fast we might call that rude (Houston!)"
bedrock,"[Intro: Lloyd]. I Can make your bed rock (Young Money). I Can make your bed rock girl. Kane is in the building nigga. I Can make your bed rock. I Can make your bed rock. [Verse 1: Lil Wayne]. She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad. I'm attracted to her with her attractive ass. And now we murderers, because we kill time. I knock her lights out and she still shine. I hate to see her go, but I'd love to watch her leave. But I keep her runnin' back and forth like a soccer team. Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve. Young Money thieves, steal your hearts with ease. [Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]. I like the way you walkin' if you walkin' my way. I'm that red bull, now let's fly away. Let's buy a place with all kinds of space. I'll let you be the judge and I'm the case. I'm Gudda Gudda, I putta other. I see me with her, no stevie Wonder. She don't even wonder, cause she know she bad. And I got her nigga, grocery bags. [Chorus: Lloyd]. Okay, ooohhh baby. I be stuck to you like glue baby. Wanna spend it all on you baby. My room is the g-spot. Call me Mr. Flinstone. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock girl. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock. [Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]. Okay I get it let me think I guess it's my turn. Maybe it's time to put this pussy when your side burns. He say I'm bad, he probably right. He pressin' me like button downs on a friday night (Ha ha ha). I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike. Be on my low scrunch. Be on my egg and whites. He say nicki don't stop you the bestest. And I just be coming off the top as bestest. [Verse 4: Drake]. I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi. I race for your love, shake and bake, ricky bobby. I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby. Girl I gotta watch my back cause I'm not just anybody. I see them standing in line, just to get beside her. I let her see the aston or let the rest surprise her. That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her. Oh that was your girl, I thought I recognized her. [Chorus: Lloyd]. Okay, ooohhh baby. I be stuck to you like glue baby. Wanna spend it all on you baby. My room is the g-spot. Call me Mr. Flinstone. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock girl. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock. [Verse 5: Tyga]. She like tannin', I like stayin' in. She like romancin', I like rollin' with friends. She said I'm caged in, I think her conscios is. She watchin' that oxygen, I'm watchin' ESPN. But when that show ends, she all in my skin lotion. No emotions, roller coasting like back, forth, hold it (Hold it [x4]). She pause like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to. Take this photo if you for me, she said don't you ever show this. I'm too loyal and too focused, to be losing and be hopeless. When I spoke this, she rejoiced it. Said your words get me open, so I closed it. Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment. [Verse 6: Jae Millz]. She ain't got a man but she's not alone. Miss independent yea she got her own. Hey gorgoues, umm, I mean flawless, well. That's what you are, how I see it, this how I call it. Yea, look at how she walk, who knew she know she bad. Do your thang baby, I ain't even mad. And I ain't leaving fast, I'm a stay a while. Hold your head chris, I'm a take her down. [Chorus: Lloyd]. Okay, ooohhh baby. I be stuck to you like glue baby. Wanna spend it all on you baby. My room is the g-spot. Call me Mr. Flinstone. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock girl. I can make your bedrock. I can make your bedrock. [Outro: Lil Wayne & Lloyd]. T Streets. Mack Maine. Jae Millz. Tyga. Drizzy Drake. Nicki Minaj. Hey Shanell. And Young Llyod. It's Young Mula Baby"

demolition freestyle pt 1,(feat. lil wayne). And I don't wanna talk about it. Gangsta shit right in front of you nigga walk around it. Nigga let me do me. They know I kick it like jet lee bruce lee. And I've done what they can't do me. I'll put my gun up to your aunt suzie. And blow out a dubie paint her rubie. I am a looney you niggas puny. I puke on the beat I juke and never fumble. Man I spit that dope like I swallowed the bundle. Gotta spit that dope up cause the old heads. Said if you don't itll bust. Heard if I sell it hard itll rush but if them. People come if it's soft itll flush. Certainly don't get caught in the blind. And keep yo curtain straight. No I don't drink wine but I smoke purple grape. Sometimes see purple stars. And I ain't talking about purple bapes. I gets paid early cause. I be workin late too many pain for memories shit hurt to say. Crack flow no bake just stir and shake. Shootin when we pull up like erkle waste. Sip syrup got me movin at a turtle pace. But quick draw pop out like a turtle face. Paid in full you can't murk the ace. I kill the beat and beat the murder case. That's right I'm a kill this shit. And if the glov don't fit. I'm a need a catchers mitt. Cause I'm high like a pitch yeah. I'm high like a pitch like mariah and shit. I guess I'm higher than a bitch. Keep it dirty like I'm lion in the ditch. Like eli I'm from new orleans I'm a giant in this bitch. Move the g and add an s and put the I before the n. And put the a in front of that and that is what I am to the end. That's a saint muthafucka simplify it for them. Where your funeral comes with a 2nd line at the end yeah. But you won't be second linin with them. Cause you be in the hearse that's behind all of them.

extraordinary,"[Hook:]. Your so extraordinary [x3]. Somethings who's got a hold on me. Your so extraordinary. Somethings who's got a hold on me. If this feeling has emotion.... Someone who's got a hold on me. [Verse 1:]. Rumble anyday nigga pick a date. I'm feeling great, I don't walk I just levitate. I come from the bottom of the slum village. Where niggas make a name for being young killers. I hate the game and all the bullshit that come with it. Sometimes I wanna get the money and be done with it. But right now I'm feeling better than the usual. Flow so ugly make my bank account beautiful. They call me Gudda nigga who is you. Bedrocking every girl was a 2 for 2. That's right nigga the more the merrier. Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga.. [Hook]. [Verse 2:]. We took the game to another level. Killing all these rap niggas time to get the shovel. I don't want this shit I want this shit forever. Until the game crown me king like Ms Corretta. Yeah. Chase the money with my eyes open. Cause I'm a die trying and never die hoping. Shit about to get critical. It's Guddaville 2, and the first one was biblical. Fuck the bullshit I'm a leave these niggas miserable. Spit the hardest shit till I start to see residuals.. That's right nigga the more the merrier. Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga.. [Hook]. [Verse 3:]. Propane thoughts; I spit gasoline.. I be the first to come and the last to leave. Some of the realest shit I ever spoke. I hope your hearing everyline and catching every quote. Flow sick there's no antidote. Lock me in the zoo. They can't tame me: I'm an animal. There's no stopping me. there's no holding me.. There's no games nigga. there's no controlling me. I know the Lord watching over me.. Had to get the snakes from around me so it's more for me.. That's right nigga the more the merrier. Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga."

YMOB, Don't make me call the bosses. YM gon eat and run like break-fast. Been running for too long it's time to take cash. And I'm a smoke the game cause no air kills. And for the money I eat beats up like bear grylls. Bitches love me when they stare I give them rare chills. But money is over her, She can't see in a pair of heels. Young nigga bout to bleed the game. Throw a stack at dem hoes and tell em keep the change. Gasoline flow light the match, Watch it spark. Fire jumpin off my lips everytime I talk. Living legend in the flesh, I'm the champ yes. I'm serving niggas like my name is Pete Sampras. Get hyphy if you want and I'm a shake them dreads. And go dumb with the tool upside your head.

Why I need a nigga when I got my tool on me. My little buddy got bullets like the army. Military thoughts like I trained with Al-Qaida. Raid a niggas crib with a box cutter razor.

To the rap game, Millz don't make classics. And I don't write songs, bitch, I create caskets. Who want a dirtnap (who) your grim reaper is here. I compose funerals for you niggaz careers. Y-your girl said my third leg was super long. She gotta lift weights with her tongue, her mouth super strong. Heatin' pad jaws, her mouth super warm. But right after I'm skatin' like I'm boardin' with some supers on. Gudda Gudda:. Ugh. Semi-automatic arsenal. Will slaughter you and turn every part of you to particles. Pain is what I ordered you, run is what you oughta do. I tear the house down, evict niggaz like the mortgage do. You niggaz gon' bother who, I come from the hardest zoo. New Orleans, Murder Capital, that's where a heart is grew. Yeah, I beat the track like a mad man. Kuz these niggaz is garbage, put these niggaz in a trashcan. I'm the one-man band and I'm marching while I'm laughin'. Drag these bitches off my stage kuz yes, I am the Sandman. Gudda Gudda, chain got boo-koo colors like Toucan Sam. Reach and you will be an amputee, cut off yo' damn hand"
welcome to guddaville,Strive ta be a winner losing not an option.. Runnin ta tha finish line an no I'm not stopin. Women can be a downfall and friends can be a problem. Watch ya steps wen u walkin. Cuz believe tha streets iz watchin. Evil theifs plottin on how they can take ya profit. And u can get a price on ya head behind gossip. I can spot a fake nigga off eye contact alone. These niggas frail no spine in they back at all. I hear whisperin snakes still slitherin. A one way ticket ta hell iz wat I deliver them. I got a sweet deal wit my connect out in michigan. I can't say much cuz I kno tha ppl listenin. I switched up my hustle it's all bout tha rap now. Doors gettin kicked in fones gettin tapped now. I got sum niggas that ain't comin hme for a while. So u shout there name in a verse just ta make them smile. Wat up big lee u comin hme soon. Son? rome n rick u comin hme to. So ima hold it down till that day come homie. This tha shit that I spit fa my dade one homies. It ain't a easy task I'm startin ta feel tha pressure. Mama told me son dnt let tha industry stress ya. Now I'm writin evry rap like it's my last one. Vitin? on tha beat with a mutha fukin passion. Yes I'm tha cash run gotta get paid. So I treat evry day like its my mutha fukin last one. Cu-cup full of lean they tell me I should quit it. And wat I tell them back mind they fukin bidness. History in tha makin ima bout ta kill it. I won't stop till I get it god as my witness. Been in tha game for a minute I'm on my hustle still. I keep it gudda still. Welcome ta guddaville. (thanks to will for these lyrics)
what a girl,"She was there for the long hall. If I go to jail she bought one for the phone call. The only one that could deal with the mood swings. Stubborn nigga she adapt to how I do things. I was stressed out. She would watch me write. She said I was talented and I would be alright. You know sometimes I wind up with them other bitches. But that's just what they are a bunch of other bitches. There's no other mrs. that compares to you. So the seven digits Imma share wit you. Listen love I place nothin above you. Like a star in the heavens that's placed up above. Im hopin that he knows im the only one that's gonna be there. Cause that's what a girl's supposed to do. And when they all turn they're back I'll still show him I care. Cause that's what a girl supposed to do. Look you more like my dawg girl you my nigga. And you'll ride for me before one of these niggas. Aye I remember the nights you used to cry. Yourself to sleep when I tell you I'll be gone to november. And on comes the winter. Cold nights alone you would call my phone tellin me. To come back home. All yo friends in yo ear sayin I do this and I do that. Man that shit is so wack. I let it gon in one ear straight out the other. Then you call my momma cryin girl you straight buggin. But yet and still you hold a nigga down. And let me know what goes around must come back around. Im hopin that he knows im the only one that's gonna be there. Cause that's what a girl's supposed to do. And when they all turn they're back I'll still show him I care. Cause that's what a girl supposed to do. Look here. You aint my girl you my homie. And I know you're tired of bein lonely. And when I come home you put it on me. That's why I give you anything you ever wanted. Im married to these streets and married to these beats. And you don't even care as long as you got me. And I got you, your front and your back. Don't trip don't slip and worry about all the other bullshit. It's like. It's us against the world and you my lady girl. Make me put that ring on you and wife you baby girl. I said. It's us against the world and you're my lady girl. Make me put that ring on you and wife you baby girl. . Im hopin that he knows im the only one that's gonna be there. Cause that's what a girl's supposed to do. And when they all turn they're back I'll still show him I care. Cause that's what a girl supposed to do. (thanks to chelle for these lyrics)"
willy wonka,(with lil wayne). I I i don't like the look of it. I I i don't like the look of it. I I i don't like the look of it. [verse 1: gudda gudda]. Ok I'm sipping on the syrup got a nigga mioving slow. I'm all bout the money what the fuck you think I do it for. Just don't act like you ain't know I'm killing these rap ass niggas. Costing them thier caskets for your motherfucking funeral. Keep these women with me shit I gotta keep two or more. Party everyday like we won the fucking superbowl. Chilling with my nigga mack he keeps bitches handy. White girls on the table let them sniff the nose candy. When I'm walking by the women say who is that. Nigga I reply I'm gudda gudda that nigga. I was raised in a home of cap splitters. Whip on 24s watch it crawl like a caterpillar. I come with a toy boy like a happy meal. And you a motherfucking duck daffy dale. From the school of hard knocks where we scrap and kill. Pick the kinfe with gunna you could get the package deal. I'm hot nigga burning everything around me. I was lost for a minute took a while but I found me. The streets say I'm king but the game will never crown me. Realest nigga doing it just ask the nigga round me. So you can't size me up but try to clown a. Shark jump in the water and I'm a drown ya. New orleans gun out I'm a down ya. Put niggas to sleep like a downer. I'm a great white you a flounder. Fish ain't a bitch I'll tuna everything around ya. You hoe gudda move everything around ya. It's young money bitch at the top is where they found us. Nigga. (wayne sparks up). [verse 2: lil wayne]. Goons I'm back marley don't shoot 'em. Silence on a gun watch a nigga mute 'em. The coach and the boot call me jon gruden. Schooled these nigga they all my students. All jokes aside I ain't playing with ya. The weed broke down like a transmission. Choppers spin like a ballerina. I'm still spitting like I ate a jalapeno. I'm from uptown my bitchs from argentina. My pockets on fat like joey cartagena. Stunt so hard it's all ya'll fault. And when it come to beef give me a-1 sauce. I ain't worrying about shit everything paid. Catch me poolside in dwayne wades house. Wth a high yellow bitch with her legs out. Catch money president but we in red house. Who the fuck want it name a fucking day. Blow the candles out my nigga cut the cake. I gotta eat bitch like a runaway. Ya'll niggas ain't eating stomache. Ok all these bitches and niggas still hatin. I used to be ballin but now I'm bill gating. Fuck you with my iphone bumpin illmatic. I'm on the road to riches it's just a lil traffic. Hair still platic fuckins a habit. Keep my guitar hip hop manny cravis. Bought your bad bitches and I fuck 'em like rabbits. Dope big weezy your girlfriends a addict. Uh. I I don't I i don't. I don't like the look of it

Foolish like shawty low and Imma get get it,. Stick shift kitted,. Maserati large got my top let back,. With the kamikazi doors,. Hoes all over me, crazy no control of me,.

Conduct disorderly, 44 bulldogs barking start sparking. And rip out your arteries,. [lil wayne]. Uhh umm,. Fresh out the carter 3. Money aint a thing muthf-cker it's the only thing,. Ha ha,. B-tch don't bother me,. My car so big, my license plate says ""pardon me"",. Yeah, louie v looks on and my jewelry. Just sang it like a slow song,. Young mula b-tch,. You f-cking with some soldiers, who ra b-tch,. Hollygrove gangsta, mixtape mangler,. Wheels on the coupe, lips bigger than tapanga's,. Two middle fingers, you don't want my anger,. Better call the rangers, but you gon need the angels,. Young money gettin money out the anus,. And I got the girls saying please lil wayne us,. Let me explain this,. I'm like travis barker I got stripes, I'm strapped and I'm famous,. I tell myself you ought to be shameless,. I pop a pill and now I feel painless,. And Imma shoot that if I aim this,. And I aint talking bout no muthf-cking sidekick,. Like, I f-ck that other side b-tch,. Eastside I ride around, you know who you ride with,. Then I'm at the hospital,. If you survive it,. Then I'm at your funeral just to see ya body,. P-ssy n-gga im a hitman,. And when it come to p-ssy n-gga Imma a clit man,. Haha shit man, I got your girl on my arm like a wrist band,. And anything I do my clique can,. They can lean on me like a kick stand,. Imma take us to the top,. And know its not a rumour, it's the rock."
