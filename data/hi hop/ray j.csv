one wish,"Damn baby. Just don't understand where we went wrong. I gave you my heart. I gave you my soul. I gave you. As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first. It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know. We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room. Cause, we couldn't be alone. See your mama knew I was something else. she knew how I felt. Back then we were in school. and that's your favourite excuse. Growin' up I was a fool. and I can't lie I'm missing you. Listen and don't trip. I think I need a bottle with a genie in it. Here's my wish list. First one, I would create a heart changing love. Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up. Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes. cause I'll be okay if I get one. If I had one wish, we would be best friends. Love would never end, it would just begin. If I had one wish, you would be my boo. Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you. If I had one wish, we would run away. Making love all day, have us a baby. If I had one wish, I'd make you my all life. And you'd be my wife, make it right this time. If I had one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. Now tell me is this the only way. I can get you right back in. If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sure. Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me. So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe. I swear if I lose a second chance with you. I wouldn't know what to do. I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic. I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick. Here's my wish list. First one, I would create a heart changing love. Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up. Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes. cause I'll be okay if I get one. If I had one wish, we would be best friends. Love would never end, it would just begin. If I had one wish, you would be my boo. Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you. If I had one wish, we would run away. Making love all day, have us a baby. If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life. And you'd be my wife, make it right this time. If I had one wish. I don't even know how we ended upon this road. And, even though we are grown. Girl I just want you to know. If I had one wish, we would be best friends. Love would never end, it would just begin. If I had one wish, you would be my boo. Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you. If I had one wish, we would run away. Making love all day, have us a baby. If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life. And you'd be my wife, make it right this time"

And threw my numbers in the trash. She found out all my codes,. Said were hoes been calling me. Went and killed my dog in me,. She's in my crib, but I'm the one who's got to leave.. I tried to kick her out.. I tried to set her free,. But she just won't let me go.. I done change all my locks.. I threw away her keys,. But she just won't leave me alone.. Shoulda listened to my father,. When he said that she wasn't the one for me.. Shoulda listened to my mother,. When she said that she wasn't no good for me.. Shoulda listened to my sister,. When I know she wasn't feeling her.. She put this spell on me and just won't let me leave.. I tried to kick her out.. I tried to set her free,. But she just won't let me go.. I done change all my locks.. I threw away her keys,. But she just won't leave me alone.. I tried to kick her out.. I tried to set her free,. But she just won't let me go..

one wish,"Damn baby. Just don't understand where we went wrong. I gave you my heart. I gave you my soul. I gave you. As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first. It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know. We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room. Cause, we couldn't be alone. See your mama knew I was something else. she knew how I felt. Back then we were in school. and that's your favourite excuse. Growin' up I was a fool. and I can't lie I'm missing you. Listen and don't trip. I think I need a bottle with a genie in it. Here's my wish list. First one, I would create a heart changing love. Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up. Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes. cause I'll be okay if I get one. If I had one wish, we would be best friends. Love would never end, it would just begin. If I had one wish, you would be my boo. Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you. If I had one wish, we would run away. Making love all day, have us a baby. If I had one wish, I'd make you my all life. And you'd be my wife, make it right this time. If I had one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. Now tell me is this the only way. I can get you right back in. If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sure. Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me. So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe. I swear if I lose a second chance with you. I wouldn't know what to do. I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic. I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick. Here's my wish list. First one, I would create a heart changing love. Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up. Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes. cause I'll be okay if I get one. If I had one wish, we would be best friends. Love would never end, it would just begin. If I had one wish, you would be my boo. Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you. If I had one wish, we would run away. Making love all day, have us a baby. If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life. And you'd be my wife, make it right this time. If I had one wish. I don't even know how we ended upon this road. And, even though we are grown. Girl I just want you to know. If I had one wish, we would be best friends. Love would never end, it would just begin. If I had one wish, you would be my boo. Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you. If I had one wish, we would run away. Making love all day, have us a baby. If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life. And you'd be my wife, make it right this time"
