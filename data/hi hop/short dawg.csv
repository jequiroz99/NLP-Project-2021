South top rag watch me drop it like a dime,. Yup that's the snitch,. Bout to hit a switch,. Screens fall watchin paid in full shouts to Mitch,. And the Ace,. Drank by the case,. Cup in my hand and it's white like paste,. Glock on my waste,. Apple over seal I'm a drink connoisseur so. I have to get em sealed,. What's the deal,. I ain't a cook but I can show you how my cake look,. That's why all these hoes on me like facebook,. A straight crook from the. 4000 block trunk waivin like a bopper as I roll down the scott. [Hook x2]. And when them boys listen to me,. I make them bring it back like a austin powers movie,. Bops wanna do me,. Cops wanna cuff me,. If a hater trip we ride on him like a huffy,. Got a throwed yella with a body like buffy,. The name Short Dawg and I be clownin like krusty,. Boys swear they love me,. But they really haters,. Cause I'm in the slab swangin like will and jada,. Plus he worth a million and runnin,. Grill with the woman,. 4 15's you can hear when I'm comin,. So why them boys frontin when they see me,. In the cadillac trunk bangin like weezy,.

Raise yo cup put yo hands on yo nuts and scream man. hold up cause we got,. [Hook x2]. I still got drank up in my cup man hold up,. Stacks got the pockets of my pants swole up,. Boys talkin down I'm like man so what,. They ain't tryna plex cause they sweeter than donuts,. And me I keeps it real,. Tell me how you feel,. Every time I spit a verse it show you why I got a deal,. Started as a dream,. Now I'm on the scene makin women scream. cause the flow tight as skinny jeans,. And I don't pen a thing every verse is off the noggin,. Southern flaame spitter got them niggas heads boppin,. Cause I'm hotter than poppa bears pourage,. Got them takin pictures like a tourist,. Whether I'm up in the club with mega,. Or in the booth recordin,. Or with my nigga pepper 5th wheel on the tauris,. I screan calls just to get the freaks mad,. And every time I pour up I wrie rest in peace Chad man. [Hook x2]"
cruizin,"[Intro:]. Yeah. H-town pull ya slabs out (H-Town!). H-town pull ya slabs out (It's goin down!). Alright alright alright. [Verse 1:]. Look, you can tell I'm a balla. When I'm in the 6-4 Chevrolet Impala. Cause the gloss on the candy paint is so lean. Rims big as Ruben, tires skinny as a dope fiend. It look clean from the oustide. But I'm ridin dirty cause of what I stashed in the rawhide. The big grills guaranteed to leave ya mouth wide. When ya see me cruzin' through the streets of the Southside. The state of Texas is where I'm from. Yeah, I'm a cowboy so when I ride I wear my gun. So run if you hear the glock noise. Or get shot down and stomped till ya all broke up like the Hot Boyz. Chicks wishin' they could ride with the young buck. While I'm lane switchin swangin' wild as some nunchucks. I told ya I'm strapped in case a hater run up. I leave 'em full of holes like a belt when I come bust. [Hook: x2]. Cause I'm cruzin' down the street in my 6-4. Roll up a sweet and fire the Indo. Let the top back, roll down the window. I'm hittin swithces on a mission to get dough. Cause I'm cruzin' down the street. Cr-cr-cruzin' down the street in my 6-4. Cruzin' down the street. Cr-cr-cruzin' down the street in my 6-4. [Verse 2:]. Uh,. You could tell I'm paper stackin. When you see my old school Chevy Capris Classic. Plus I got the speakers blastin. Bangin, ride with me, you gon' need to bring some aspirin. Four twelves in the trunk bridge the amplified. But the lil' rims with the slim lay on the camel tires. I hit the A and vallet at the Lenox mall. Smokin' on some sticky the same color as tennis balls. I ain't finished dawg. It's full of screens on the seats, reclined. While I'm watchin Crazy Joe in ""Lean On Me"". I had to stop when the cops put the beams on me. Cause he pulled me over askin if I had some weed on me. But I told him no, so he let me go. He thought I was high cause I was ridin in my Chevy slow. Okay, I was blowed but I ain't tell him that. Slowin up traffic I'm the cat they yellin at. [Hook: x2]. Cause I'm cruzin' down the street in my 6-4. Roll up a sweet and fire the Indo. Let the top back, roll down the window. I'm hittin swithces on a mission to get dough. Cause I'm cruzin' down the street. [Verse 3:]. Damn!. I had to park the 6-4 cause it had a scratch. I ain't trippin now it's time to pull out the Cadillac. Yeah, that's how we do it down in H-Town. Ridin Fleetwoods bout as long as a Greyhound. On the steerin wheel is where the wood grain go. I got the fifth wheel but I ain't talkin bout a game show. You might see a playa swangin', swervin'. Cause down here all they drink is syrup'll have ya lazy. Eyes low, Screw tape screamin' play me. Fat Pat rappin man, hold up baby. Man, but a playa still cruzin'. Let the boy Short show you how we do in Houston. Even from the haters dawg, I gain respect. Cause when I pass by, I have his chick bout to sprain her neck. You wonder why ya ho wanna ride with me. Cause I'm on Spreewells and you rollin' on Mike Bibby's. Get with me"
