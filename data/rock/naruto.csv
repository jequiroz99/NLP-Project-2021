blue bird (english version),"You say if you could fly. You'd never want to come back down. That you'd only have eyes. For that, for that, blue, blue sky. I know that you have to learn just what real sadness is. And you are just grasping now, the meaning of pain inside. Even the feeling I have for you deep in my heart. Must be expressed in words that I can't find. As you awake, from deepest dream. Into this world, you've never seen. I know you'll spread your wing and take. Off to the sky. You say if you could fly. You'd never want to come back down. That you'd only have eyes. For that, for that, blue, blue sky. If you can make it through. I know you'll find what you're seeking. Keep trying to break free. To that, to that, blue, blue sky. To that, to that, blue, blue sky. Oh that, oh that, clear blue sky. (Instrumental). And with a sound in the long time abandoned ruin. The crystal panes between us, they fell away into dust. That cage you once were within is now gone to the past. Not turning back you walk away with me. That throbbing beat, so breathlessly. Calling you on, to go and see. The window opens and you find. That you are free. You say if you could run. You'd never stop ‘till you found it. That you'd always move on. Following that clear distant song. It grips you from afar. A shining hand of the future. You will pursue that dream. To that, to that, clear blue sky. (Instrumental). I understand that you. Has fallen in the dark. But still you will, continue on. To follow the light in your heart. You say if you could fly. You'd never want to come back down. That you'd only have eyes. For that, for that, blue, blue sky. If you can make it through. I know you'll find what you're seeking. Keep trying to break free. To that, to that, blue, blue sky. To that, to that, blue, blue sky.
