a minute longer,. VERSE 1. They're calling out. Come on lets go. But i'm miles away. To a year before. Laughs from a glass. Drank to the past. On the old green seat. Like velvet to the hand. (chorus). Think i'd like to stay for a minute longer. Would you like to stay for a minute longer. VERSE 2. Last one for some. Sick from the rum. I played golf on the carpet with someone. Crash back to date. Few things i hate. But i'd rather us live. In the present day. (chorus). If you'd like i'd stay for a minute longer. As longer. As longer. Longer. repeat to fade.
a thousand trees,Standing at the bus stop. with my shopping in my hands. when I'm overhearing elderly ladies. as the rumours start to fly. Hear them in the school yard. in the scrap yard. in the chip shop. in the phone box. in the pool hall. at the shoe store. every corner turned around. It started with a school girl. who was running. running home to her mum and dad. told them she was playing. in the change room. of her local football side. They said tell us again. she told them again. they said tell us the truth. I find it hard to believe. cause he taught our Steve. he even trained me. taught Uncle john. who's a father of three. CHORUS. It only takes one tree. to make a thousand matches. only takes one match. to burn a thousand trees. You see it in the class room. in the swimming pool. where the match stick men are made. at the scouts hall. at the football. where the wise we trust are paid. They all honour his name. he did a lot for the game. he got his name knocked up. above the sports ground gates. Now they're ripping them down. stamping the ground. picture gathers dust. in the bar. CHORUS. Wake up and smell the rain. shake up he's back to stay. he hasn't been on a holiday. growing seeds don't believe. why he's been away. In the school yard. change room. playing fields. bathroom. phone box. office blocks. corners turned around. They keep fanning the flame. tossing the blame. got his name knocked up. above the sports ground gates. Now they're ripping them down. stamping the ground. pictures gathers dust. in the bar in the lounge. CHORUS.

an audience with mr nice,"I got a phone call today from Mr. Nice. He has oftened called...once or twice. He's on stage in town asked me to come down. I was five minutes late I had to pop by the gates. I stood at the side and I listened and I tried. To imagine a life that gave him that smile. An audience where that reads on the bill. A man that made his millions smugglin' for thrills. ooooohh. Master of skies and masters degrees. Who's goal in life is to set what grows free. I would drink and smoke while some think it's a joke. When someone's in pain, you can't take up a string. And I like stories told and well 'til I'm old. Are the ones growing up are going to love what we know. Is it going to fast, am I living in the past? Do we think anymore?. Or live behind closed doors?. ooooohh. There's something about a man on a stage. That'll make you listen and think I want to come back again. And so Mr. Nice there it is. I'm glad you called, I had me a ball. ooooohh."

bank holiday monday,"Woke up with the shakes on the bathroom floor. The sun is shining, I felt like drinking some more. Sunday’s takeaway welded on my elvis tray. It’s a pound a can in the garden all day. Start at noon, keep on going through til two. Dabbing speed like a monkey in a fucking zoo. Get your girl in the bathroom, after flirting all day. It’s the time of your life on Bank Holiday Monday. Street Fighting. Yet some day. You get out. Out of those mondays. Yes some say. They were the best days. Out of our minds. Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah. 8 O’clock time to catch the next bus to town. When the drink is in, the wit is most definitely out. Late bars, fight starts, between my brother and I. Get kicked out so we hold tight and take it outside. Dodging cars, new scars, fighting out on the road. Knees me in the chest my head and arse hits the floor. Swallowed tongue, what we done, someone’s hand in my mouth. Got to pull it back out on a Bank Holiday Monday. Street Fighting. Yet some day. You get out. Out of those mondays. Yes some say. They were the best days. Out of our minds. Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah. I want to stick him real hard with a kitchen knife. But we share the same bed in my mam’s house tonight. I wait, I wait, I wait, until he walks up the lane. It’s all the fun of the fair on Bank Holiday Monday. Street Fighting. Yet some day. You get out. Out of those mondays. Yes some say. They were the best days. Out of our minds. Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah"

everyday i think of money,"I drive a truck, it carries money,. And everyday, I dream up my fantasies.. Yesterday, I bought my beach house,. A little place just off the coast of France.. Everyday I think of money,. Everyday I think of running.. I love my truck, I love my family,. Stuck in the back, the good life surrounds me.. Could tie my right hand man, and put him some place,. Then I’d ditch the truck, and buy a new face.. Everyday I think of money,. Everyday I think of something.. It cant buy you love, cant give you soul,. Can pick you up, can down you low.. Can drag you out of the hole,. You dug, yourself, out of again.. Sat in a truck, it it carries convicts,. My hands are bound to the seat by handcuffs,. Tomorrow, I’ll maybe walk around the yard,. Or paint in my cell, and hate imprisonment.. Everyday I think of money,. Everyday I miss my family.."

fiddler's green,"September seventeen. For a girl I know it's Mother's Day. Her son has gone alee. And that's where he will stay. Wind on the weathervane. Tearing blue eyes sailor-mean. As Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain. For a boy in Fiddler's Green. His tiny knotted heart. Well, I guess it never worked too good. The timber tore apart. And the water gorged the wood. You can hear her whispered prayer. For men at masts that always lean. That same wind that moves her hair. Moves a boy through Fiddler's Green. Ohhhh nothing changed anyway. Ahh nothing's changed anyway. Ahh anytime the day. He doesn't know a soul. And there's nowhere that he's really been. But he won't travel long alone. No, not in Fiddler's Green. Balloons all filled with rain. As children's eyes turn sleepy-mean. And Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain. For a boy in Fiddler's Green."

getaway,"GETAWAY. Remember when we were angels. Before we stole cars. And when sex and drugs. Lived up in another world... not a care in the world. Hide and seek, kissing and running. Til you were out of breath. In the late day sun. Until your mamma called you home... and you didn't wanna go. . Fly High. Be my getaway. Gotta get away. Fly High. Be my getaway. Gotta get away. Coppers, robbers, cowboys and indians. Hanging round the corner. Of the street you lived. How come it seemed so far away... just a stone throw away. Your best friend wasn't someone you worked with. And money from your old man. Would burn a hole. In your pocket all day... not a single debt to pay. Fly High. Be my getaway. Gotta get away. Fly High. Be my getaway. Gotta get away. Fly High. Be my getaway. Gotta get away. Fly High. Be my getaway. Gotta get away. Fly High. Be my getaway. Gotta get away."

Someone died, they surfed the train and slipped up. Train comes the coach she's always used to. The doors read a ""Marry me I love you"". Heart stops ecstatic and suspicious.

He had a bag full of money. He said ""Just drive me away"". I didn't know where I was going. Yet it felt good to be strange. And still I look up. And look in the mirror behind me. And still I look up. And look in the mirror behind me. Curiosity is over. He stepped down from the car. He pulled a gun from his jacket. Said I was going to die. ""It gives me so much satisfaction. To watch you beg and cry"". Well I just made up this story. To get your attention, makes me smile. I never looked up or looked. In the mirror behind me"

my hero,"To my hero. You're calling out to me. The ray of light you shine. Is bright. I wish you could see all the good that you put in my life. I hear you singing. Oh to hear you singing. Songs that made you young when you were winning. You filled a room with life. When you were drinking. And then I'd hear you say. I've seen things. Things that I hope you will never see ever again. You're like paul newman. Looking at the moon. Your eyes twinkle. Like midnight in the garden of eden. You suffered just south of heaven. But all the things you've done for us. Are long gone now. All is fair in love n' war the question is how?. Heart sinking. To think the man I knew was sent killing. Not all the tales you told were filled with sorrow. You found yourself a girl that gave you tomorrow. The rest is left to us. Now I've seen things. I wouldn't have seen if you hadn't have fought for my days. To my hero. To my hero. You gave us what we know. But now you have to go. To my hero, my hero"
my own worst enemy,"I just turned 26 and she is 23. She wore a crusifix but never preached at me. We'd stay up all the night until the day was dead. I got the fear of God inside my broken head. Wanna fly away. And change my ways. I'll beat myself to death while she sits next to me. I wanna free myself from all this misery. I wanna taste the love but life's against up me. But I am my own worst enemy. I try to get some sleep, her arms are over me. I'm staring at the walls, they're closing in on me. The sun bleeds through the blinds, it washes over me. Today's the day I tell myself to set me free. Wanna fly away. And change my ways. I'll beat myself to death while she sits next to me. I wanna free myself from all this misery. I wanna taste the love but life's against up me. But I am my own worst enemy. (Feel...wanna feel it...wanna feeel it...wanna feel it. Wanna feel it...wanna feel it). I wanna fly away.

nice to be out,"He asked me ""so where have you been?"". Let me think now let me see.. I stood once where Hitler's feet stood when he made a speech. In Nuremburg in '38 he tried to build the perfect. race,. He said ""black men ain't gonna run alongside our. perfect sons."". It was Dallas to the library, the place they ended. Kennedy.. I stood where Oswald took his shot, in my opinion. there's a bigger plot.. Costners back into the left, the picket fence, the. better bet.. Paris came and Summer went, the tunnel's now a flower bed.. The famous turf that made Geoff Hurst,. the vodka stops to quench my thirst.. Golden gate stroke Alcatraz. and the fat man failed to get us passes.. Jimmy's corner in Raging Bull,. De Niro's jokes and bottled pills.. Elvis tales from Mr. Woodward,. any Richard Burton if you could?. The tourists stare at tourist stops.. One more picture, one more god.. Another top up for a change,. It makes you think, it makes you sane.. Talking more about yourself,. there's a mirror to have a check.. Cheques are always passing through,. some depart but a lot come too.. Restaraunt talk of pick your teeth.. You bite your tongue or chew your meat.. Sleep to drink or drink to sleep,. One more week and we will meet.. We'll talk of what we haven't done since we departed back a month.. We argue while we have to shout.. All in all, it's nice to be out."

Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want. I can see whoever I choose. I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant-but nothing. I said nothing can take away these blues. 'cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. It's been so lonely without you here. Like a bird without a song. Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling. Tell me baby, oh where did I go wrong?. I could put my arms around every girl I see. But they'd only remind me of you. So I went to the doctor guess what he told me. guess what he told me. He said boy you better try to have fun. No matter what you do. But he's a fool. 'cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. All the flowers that you planted momma in the backyard. All died when you went away. I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard. But I'm willing to give it another try. Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you"

You just wanna be on the side that's winnin'. You say I let you down, you know it's not like that. If you're so hurt why then don't you show it?. You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at. You have no faith to lose, and you know it. I know the reason that you talk behind my back. I used to be among the crowd you're in with. Do you take me for such a fool. To think I would make contact?. The one who tries to hide what he don't know. To begin with. You see me on the street, you always act surprised. You say How are you? Good luck! but you don't mean it. When you know as well as me. You'd rather see me paralized. Why don't you just come at once out screaming. No, I do not feel that good. I see the heartbreaks you embrace. If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them. And though you're dissatisfied with your position. And your place. Don't you understand, it's not my problem?.

postmen do no make great movie heros make,"You're not in business to be popular,. It's become so much about personality,. I would regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms,. The most immediate way in which a human being can share with another,. the sense of what appears to be the human being,. First of all I choose the great roles,. And if none of these come, I choose the ones that pay the rent,. It was like an unfinished business in my life,. Wherever I went people would say ""you would have made a great James Bond"",. Yes. Lets face it, postmen do not great movie heroes make,. The imagination, the industry and intelligence, the three I's, out the door,. Do not try to push your way through the Rembrandts of the profession,. But do your up most to find an entry into the world of media,. There is the same surge of adrenalin you get just in front of the camera lens,. We have lost our sense of ritual and ceremony,. We blame the artists for not finding them for us,. Actors often behave like children, and so they're taken for children,. Such is an actors life,. Lets face it, postmen do not great movie heroes make,. They tramp discontently through the neighborhood,. And the only matter of contact with fellow human beings,. Tends to be, tends to be reading names and addresses off an envelope,. It is a great job,. There is the same surge of adrenalin, you get just before the camera lens,. Okay if I wasn't an actor I'd be a secret agent."

Do you remember all our stupid dreams?. Rainbows and pots of gold. So much to prove before we got old. I took you places round the world. I miss your face sometimes you know. You took my picture a thousand times. I'll buy them back; I don't mind. I lost my way but found my track. I'm sorry if I never listened back. I've been round; I've been up and down. And you missed the one we dressed like clowns. And how's your car and how's your life?. How's my friend; when's she gonna be your wife?. I'm sitting up writing down. These things I sometimes dream about. I knew your number off by heart. It's the only one I like to talk. It wasn't me using you. I trusted you; one of the few. And we had some laughs; had some rows. But in the end the walls came down. You like the place I'm living now. It's a shame you can't come around. And I've grown a lot since we last spoke. Got myself together; fixed what was broke. I wonder if we'll talk again. Or drink together just like then. I suppose it's different now it's new. Whoever points the finger at who. I really hope you're happy both of you. And maybe sometimes you miss me too

It‘s been two years my minds not clear I'll stop at Raymond's shop. It‘s boarded up, he‘s gone away. The words got out and there‘s no doubt it came from Raymond's shop.

You're told was right?. Dream and be. What you feel. Don't you compromise. What you wanna be. 'Cause change is okay. What's the point in staying the same. Regrets, forget what's dead and gone. If you could rewind your time. Would you change your life?. If Jesus rode in on a camel today. With your cross on his shoulder. Time to take you away. Have you done all you wanted?. Are you happy and warm?. Do you miss someone special. You don't see anymore?. Have you blood on your hands?. Do you dream of white sands?. Can you sleep well at night?. Fave you done all you can?. The place I was born in. Stays crooked and straight. I see innocent blue eyes. Go blind everyday. Rewind your time. Would you change your life. Today?"

Roll the dice. Voice in my head screams out. Nine lives are running out. What goes up must come down. Chances you'll hit the ground. Everything's relative. What you got left to give. Don't you want time to live?. Made up your final wish. Taking another risk. Clenching another fist. Time give those wounds a lick. Teach an old dog new tricks. Luck will run out on you. Black cats in front of you. Mirror just broke in two. Everyone's out to get you. Imagine to feel you're on your own. Life with no family. Feel tomorrow's inferior. It's over. Today. Your show is over. Don't you know. They're out to get you"

the last resort,"She came from providence, one in Rhode Island. Where the old world shadows hang, heavy in the air. She packed her hopes and dreams, like a refugee. Just as her father came, across the sea.. She heard about a place, people were smiling. Spoke about the red mans way, the howling of the land. They came from everywhere, to the Great Divide. Seeking a place to stay, or a place to hide.. Down in the crowded bars, out for a good time. Can't wait to tell you all, what it's like up there. They call it Paradise, I don't know why. Somebody laid the mountains low, while the tide got high.. Then the chilly winds blew down, across the desert. Through the canyons out the coast, to the Malibu. Where the pretty people play, hunting for power. Too like them in your ways, give 'em things to do. Some rich man came and wrecked the land. Nobody caught him. They call it paradise, the place to be. They watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea. You can leave it all behind and sail to Ohio. Just like the missionaries did, so many years ago. But even down in the outside, Jesus is coming. He bought the white mans burden down. He bought the white mans ring. Who will provide the grand design..what is yours and what is mine. Cause there is no more new frontier,. We have got to make it here, satisfy your endless needs. And justify your bloody deeds. In the name of destiney, In the name of God. And you can see them there, on a Sunday morning. Stand up and sing about, what it's like up there. They call it Paradise, I don't know why. Call some place Paradise, Kiss it goodbye."
the old laughing lady,"Don't call pretty Peggy. She can't hear you no more. Don't leave no message 'round her back door. They say the old laughing lady been here before. She don't keep time. She don't count scores. You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no walls. You got to move, there's no time for you to stall. They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call. And when she leaves she leaves nothing at all. See the drunkard of the village falling off the street. Can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet. He loves his old laughing lady. 'Cause the taste is so sweet. But the laughing lady's loving. Ain't the kind he can keep. There's a fever on the freeway. Blacks out tonight. There's a slipping on the stairway. That don't feel right. There's a rumbling in the bedroom. And a flashing light. There's the old laughing lady. Everything is alright. There's the old laughing lady. Everything is alright."

traffic,"We all face the same way. Still it takes all day. I take a look to my left, pick out the worst and the best. She paints her lip, greasy and thick. Another mirror stare, and she's going where?. Another office affair, to kill an unborn scare?. You talk dirty to a priest?It makes them human at least. But is she running away, to start a brand new day?. Or is she going home? Why's she driving alone?. Is anyone going anywhere?. Everyone's gotta be somewhere. She got a body in the boot, or just bags full of food?. Those are model's legs, but are they women's are they men's?. She shops down the phone, missed a payment on the loan. She gotta be above the rest, keeping up with the best. Is anyone going anywhere?. Everyone's gotta be somewhere. Waits tables for a crook?. Wrote a hardback book?. Do ya teach kids how to read?. Or sell your body on the street?. A nurse without a job?. Another uptown snob?. But have I got you all wrong?. One look and you were gone. Is anyone going anywhere?. Everyone's gotta be somewhere."

I'm in trouble. Won't you save our souls tonight. Oh work to borrow. 'Cause we can't buy with what we got. Oh no one to follow. No one's saying such a lot. I'm in trouble, You're in trouble. Deep, deep trouble. Someone burst our bubble. I'm in trouble. Won't you save our souls tonight. Oh nowhere to run to. There's fighting everywhere we go. Oh getting brainwashed. What do you believe in anymore?. Oh can you feel it?. There's no money in this town?. I'm in trouble. You're in trouble. Deep deep trouble. Ya gone and burst our bubble. I'm in trouble. Won't you save our souls tonight."
uppercut,"Time bomb where did it go wrong. Street fights in the city lights for you, who are you?. The uppercut from the upper class. I spilled my drink and I broke my glass for you, who are you?. You look fit but you ain’t got it. Think you’re a dog well you’re just a bitch. I bet you’d like to take me for a ride. Sing loud all you people. We're fighting in the streets. Sing loud all you people. This city’s killing me. With no money and the cupboard’s bare. knew who I was and I didn't care for you, who are you?. The undercurrent of the underdog. Will wipe the floor with your suit and job you do, who are you?. You box clever like to box you hard. So what do you got without your credit card. Not a lot ‘cause what you think you’ve got’s not real. Sing loud all you people. We're fighting it in the streets. Sing loud all you people. This city’s killing me. Time bomb where did it go wrong.

We're fighting in the streets. Sing loud all you people. This city’s killing me"

violins and tambourines,"Looking out the window, staring at the road. Doesn't really matter, which way to go. Everything is changing, nothing ever seems,. To stay the same. Violins and Tambourines, n' candy canes and magazines. Preachers sermons on the streets. I killed a man but is life is cheap they say. Stopped on the way home, side of the road. met her at the drug store saving peoples souls. she offered me redemption, take a drink instead if thats ok. Violins and Tambourines, n' candy canes and magazines. Preachers sermons on the streets. I killed a man but is life is cheap they say. Violins and Tambourines, n' candy canes and magazines.

watch them fly sundays,"I’d just like to say,. that I remember the day,. that I first woke with you,. Some days I have to admit,. The way we happened to meet,. Was strange, because it was new.. I’m not drinking no more,. Not drinking no less,. Not sleeping at all,. Never in the same bed,. Undressed at the bar,. Engraved bench in the park,. We’d watch them fly Sundays.. Fly, birds round my head again,. Laughed at the words that you said,. I pushed the boat back to you,. I flew from the rain again,. Killed you with what I said,. You already knew.. Not thinking no more,. Not drinking no less,. Not sleeping at all,. Never in the same bed,. Undressed at the bar,. Engraved bench in the park,. We’d watch them fly Sundays.. They say if something should fly away,. And it comes back to you again,. Then it’s yours.."
we share the same sun,Calling over to seize my hunger. To see you to feel you. To be with need you. We hold out we hold on. I'm older colder. Here it comes light up my sky. [Chorus:]. Yeah we share the same sun. Everyday. Yeah we share the same sun. Everyday. White lights blinding. Headlights driving. To see you to feel you. To be with need you. We hold out we hold on. I'm older colder. Here it comes light up my sky. [Chorus]. When my light is out for you at home. It shines for me in early dawn. We're worlds apart but now I see. I'm in your heart whenever we are apart. And the sky shines bright. Within the morning sun (in the morning sunday morning sun). Our time has just begun (time has just begun has just begun). In the morning sun (in the morning sunday morning sun). Our time to end [?] will come. [Chorus]. When my light is out for you at home. It shines for me in early dawn. We're worlds apart but now I see. I'm in your heart whenever we are apart. And the sky shines bright. Yeah we share the same sun everyday
white lies,"I don't know where you are. Or what you wanna do. It seems so these days. I'm losing out on you. Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah. You come home so late. I don't know where you been. I wanna hold you tight. But you make me wanna scream. Yeah yeah. Oh? so now we're fighting in the streets. I can't breathe. 'Cause I don't believe words you say. No? your white lies don't protect me. Be honest with me. It's all we can be to sustain. I drove around all morning. Thinking of starting again. Turning my back on a good thing. I turned the car 'round instead. No? your white lies don't protect me. Be honest with me it's all we can be to sustain. Oh? so no more fighting in the streets. And I can't breath 'cause I don't believe. Words you say.

who'll stop the rain,"Long as I remember. The rain been coming down. Clouds of mystery falling. Confusion on the ground. Good men through the ages. Trying to find a sun. And I wonder, still I wonder. Who'll stop the rain. I went down Virginia. Seeking shelter from the storm. Caught up in the fable. I watched the tower grow. About your plans for new year. Wrapped in golden chains. And I wonder still I wonder. Who'll stop the rain. Heard the singers playing. How I cheered for more. The crowd had rushed together. Trying to keep warm. And still the rain kept falling. falling on my head. And I wonder still I wonder. Who'll stop the rain"
wonder,"I wanted it all, wanted what I could not control. I levelled it off to a place where I could feel alive. and I'm not weighed down at all. I'm learning a lot, learning that I've just gotta let go. I cannot carry it all, It's not who I was. Taking me back to this place. Where I loved when I was just a boy. Do you wanna just remember. Who you are?. I wanna be back in our summer. Do you remember?. Come with me. No room for thunder. Not going under. I wanna be, free, breathe. Dream about our summer. I'll always wonder. Yeah we wandered around. Swimming at night under the stars. and no-one there to bring us down. We'll never be down. Now I know that when I think back. All this stuff's a state of mind. Don't you wanna just remember. Who you are?. I wanna be back in our summer. Do you remember?. Come with me. No room for thunder. Not going under. I wanna be, as good as it was. It wasn't enough, I wanted it all. I wanted too much, I'll never forget. About our summer. I'll always wonder about our summer."
