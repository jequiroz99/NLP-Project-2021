savior,"It kills me not to know this. But I've all but just forgotten. What the color of her eyes were. And her scars or how she got them. As the telling signs of age rain down. A single tear is dropping. Through the valleys of an aging face. That this world has forgotten. There is no reconciliation. That will put me in my place. And there is no time like the present. To drink these draining seconds. But seldom do these words ring true. When I'm constantly failing you. Like walls that we just can't break through. Until we disappear. So tell me now. If this ain't love then how do we get out?. Because I don't know. That's when she said I don't hate you boy. I just want to save you. While there's still something left to save (Oooh oooh). That's when I told her I love you girl. But I'm not the answer for the questions. That you still have (Oooh oooh). But the day pressed on like crushing weights. For no man does it ever wait. Like memories of dying days. That deafen us like hurricanes. Bathed in flames we held the brand. Uncurled the fingers in your hand. Pressed into the flesh like sand. Now do you understand?. So tell me now. If this ain't love then how do we get out?. Because I don't know. That' s when she said I don't hate you boy. I just want to save you. While there's still something left to save (Oooh oooh). That's when I told her I love you girl. But I'm not the answer for the questions. That you still have (Oooh oooh). One thousand miles away. There's nothing left to say. But so much left that I don't know. We never had a choice. This world is too much noise. It takes me under. it takes me under once again. I don't hate you. I don't hate you, no. So tell me now. If this ain't love then how do we get out?. Because I don't know. That's when she said I don't hate you boy. I just want to save you. While there's still something left to save (Oooh oooh). That's when I told her I love you girl. But I'm not the answer for the questions. That you still have (Oooh oooh). I don't hate you.

They pissed in his hands. I told them to stop. But then I joined in. We beat him with guns. And batons not just once. But again and again. A hero of war. Yeah that's what I'll be. And when I come home. They'll be damn proud of me. I'll carry this flag. To the grave if I must. Because it's flag that I love. And a flag that I trust. She walked through bullets and haze. I asked her to stop. I begged her to stay. But she pressed on. So I lifted my gun. And I fired away. The shells jumped through the smoke. And into the sand. That the blood now had soaked. She collapsed with a flag in her hand. A flag white as snow. A hero of war. Is that what they see. Just medals and scars. So damn proud of me. And I brought home that flag. Now it gathers dust.

3 day weekend,(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). A side from the name that holds us together. Now I think we'd fall apart. It's the years we'll pretend we've forgotten. That separate our hearts. And I don't remember the way this was. but the pictures prove I knew you once. And where is the source of our mistakes. I'm afraid one day we'll drift so far. We'll wake up not knowing where we are. These words accomplish nothing if I'm gone

We point the finger, never accept the blame and I know.. I know. The waters come but the fire still rages on here. The men all shrugged their shoulders and left. We sleep so sound in rooms just up the stairs. Will you save us like you saved them?. If I held my ground would you ask me to change. This drought bleeds on now were dancing for rain. We drink the air but its so not the same. These worlds colide but the distance remains. We point the finger, never accept the blame and I know.. I know. You've let me dry but I'm still breathing. I swear I'm sucking dry the sky. And you wont ever find us kneeling. Or swollowing your lies. If I held my ground would you ask me to change. This drought bleeds on now were dancing for rain.

Unknowing, we lie and wait for the rain. To wash away what they have made. Face down in the dirt with your foot on my back. In the distance I hear thunder crack. C'mon Stand up !. This system of power and privilege is about to come to an end. Here come the clouds. The first drop is falling down (falling down). We’ve had enough. Is there even anything left to explain? (We’ve had enough). Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We’ve had enough). Can’t you listen to what we have to say? (We’ve had enough). Our futures burn in red horizons. Ashes scattered in winds of change. Casualty numbers are rising. Now it’s time to raise the stakes. We’re meant for something more than living just to put food on our plates. I can’t help but wonder--why should we participate?. We’ve had enough. Is there even anything left to explain? (We’ve had enough). Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We’ve had enough). Can’t you listen to what we have to say? (We’ve had enough)"
ready to fall,Hold on slow down let's hear from the top now. and tell me everything. I know Ive been gone for what seems like forever. But I'm here now waiting. To convince you that I'm not a ghost or a stranger. But closer than you think. She said just go on she wants you. And same does your life by. Please don't die on me. Wings wont take me. Eyes closed face me. So take a step. But don't look down. take a step. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall. (ready to fall). I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall. Perpetual motion the image wont focus. A blur is all that's in. But here in this moment like the eye of the storm. It all came clear to me. I found a shelter to lean on. And I thought of a reason to live all by itself. I took one last look from the heights that. I once loved. And then I ran like hell. Wings won't take me. Eyes closed face me. So take a step. But don't look down. take a step. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall. (ready to fall). I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall. I count the times that Ive been sorry. (I know I know). Now my conventions slowly drowns. (I know I know). If there's a time these walls could guard you. (I know I know). Then let that time be right now. I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall). I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall). I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall). I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall [x5]

the great die-off,"Theres a fire on the borders. And it's burning down the walls you built high. And there's a steady stream of anger. And it's spilling from the coasts. A tidal wave. And the words they will reap what we sold. To where I bury you up in my home. The nights recreate and were sick of the wait. We want it all and we want it now. Tonight I'll watch your fires burn on. With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours. Oh oh!. We want it all and we want it now. Time has come in to drown you out. We make ourselves at home while your body's at war. Oh oh!. Go!. Traditions tears at us and rituals. And we are all just clocks on wrong times. Something triggers each and every time I hear you say. ""God bless this place! "". But your numbers have turned to me now. Though in danger we'll still hunt you down. With hands on the stake. Long may you rain. We want it all and we want it now. Tonight I'll watch your fires burn on. With these guns in hand we pry these guns from yours. Oh oh!. We want it all and we want it now. Time has come in to drown you out. We make ourselves at home while your body's at war. Ooh yeah!. And theres a fire on the borders. And it's burning down the walls you built high. And there's a steady stream of anger.

No, I don't wanna wait. I know I better way. So step aside and come on. Better yet just go away. Our change has finally come. There might be another one now. No, we're not gonna wait. We want it now. Yeah, we're dust in the flames. We want it now!"
welcome to the breakdown,"All hail, the jester has landed. Defile the country he sings. Charmed like a snake in a basket. Should be coiled up and ready to spring. We're raising our cross just to burn it. The clergy are selling their souls. Clearing a path. Ignoring the facts. Intoxicated by the throne. We'll be standing here holding our ground. come what may. Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave. Welcome to the breakdown. Welcome to the end of the road. Welcome to the breakdown. We've got nowhere else to go. Will we all go deaf in the chamber of echoes. Cheering the missile parade. Agreeing to let all the banks rob the people. Together we circle the drain. We'll be standing here holding our ground. come what may. Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave. Welcome to the breakdown. Welcome to the end of the road. Welcome to the breakdown. We've got nowhere else to go. Welcome to the breakdown. Welcome to the end of the road. This is a breakdown. And we've got nowhere else to go. It's a game you've been playing. It's a fragile machine. It's a pied-piper song. That has lulled you to sleep. It's a lie and you fell for it. Hook line and sinker. A hand that you shook. That then gave you the finger. A fraud and a fake. A cowardly king. That lied to your face. But you still kiss the ring. This is the breakdown!. This is the breakdown!. This is the breakdown!. Im standing here holding our ground. Come what may. Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave. Welcome to the breakdown. Welcome to the end of the road. This is a breakdown. We've got nowhere else to go. Welcome to the breakdown. Welcome to the end of the road. This is a breakdown. And we've got nowhere else to go. It's not much, but this is home. And there's nowhere else to go"
how many walls,"How many walls can you put up?. How many guns 'til you feel safe?. How many times can we watch this story. Over and over and over again?. And how many years have we wasted. Counting the lies that we've been fed?. For something to change we have waited. Over and over and over again. I'm entertained by the monkey on your back. But can we still call it a joke. If no one laughs?. It's either going up in smoke around me. Or according to plan. A bittersweet disaster. Mounting over and over again. How many walls can you put up?. How many guns 'til you feel safe?. How many times can we watch this story. Over and over and over again?. How many years have we wasted. Counting the lies that we've been fed?. For something to change we have waited. Over and over and over again. Chasing our own tail. The more we learn, the less we know. As the monsters lost in history. And now making their return. As we bow down!. Roll out the carpet red as rose. We should have known. How many walls can you put up?. How many guns 'til you feel safe?. How many times can we watch this story. Over and over and over again?. How many years have we wasted. Counting the lies that we've been fed?. For something to change we have waited. Over and over and over again!. How many walls?. How many guns?. How many times?. Over and over and over again. Over and over and over again. And how many lives have been wasted?. How many bodies laid to rest?. Sick of the lies, the same old story. All over and over and over and over. Over and over and over and over again!"

3 day weekend,(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). A side from the name that holds us together. Now I think we'd fall apart. It's the years we'll pretend we've forgotten. That separate our hearts. And I don't remember the way this was. but the pictures prove I knew you once. And where is the source of our mistakes. I'm afraid one day we'll drift so far. We'll wake up not knowing where we are. These words accomplish nothing if I'm gone
401 kill,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). As I watch your life go up in flames. you'll swear up and down you'd like to change. but when the sun sinks slowly into the sky now you're right. where you started again. with nothing to say, without an argument or case. and when it's said and done and done and said and now. what's another day?. I can feel these changes right before my eyes. I see a dying fire inside your eyes. Inside your eyes. When will you stop and realize. the worth and value of your life?. as you suffocate yourself within this mindless 9-5. wake up! there's more!. andyour life is nobody's but yours and now its said and done and done and. said and now what's another day?. I can feel these changes right before my eyes. I see a dying fire inside your eyes. you're running circles around my slow pace. you've reached the finish line only to realize there was no race. I'm sick of being stepped on for the things I choose. I give and take and now I've taken all I could. And I've taken all I could (x2). And I've taken all I could! (I've taken!, I've taken!) (x2). And I've taken all I could!!!"
a beautiful indifference,"There's a struggle coming, but to conquer. First they must divide. The machines keep humming night and day. How are we so unaware. Why are you not afraid?. Protests are drumming. While you turn your nose and roll your eyes. Knee-jerk reactions so ingrained. Judging from an arm chair. Cause there is hate. And there is love and there is loss. But there is light and there is dark. Then there is us. And wheather this world burns. Is none of your concern. Caught up in a ticker-tape parade. I have learned to stand up. And just to walk away. Sometimes the cold hearts. Aren't worth the love or the hate. Learn to let go, learn to walk away. Up from the shadows. I'm seduced by the light of the flame. But this time I'm here to stay. Gunpowder residue. Bright lights and turpentine. True colors shining through. As we are stripped of our exteriors. Now, cause there is hate. And there is love and there is loss. But there is right and there is wrong. Then there is us. We're falling until we learn to stand up. And just to walk away. Sometimes the cold hearts. Aren't worth the love or the hate. Learn to let go, learn to walk away. Up from the shadows. I'm seduced by the light of the flame. But this time I'm here to stay. Feet first into the quicksand. Every day we are surrendering. Never straying from the game plan. I keep hoping you will take my hand and stand up. The water's overflowing. The walls are breaking. But I know where. I'm going, that we can make it. And there's a light still glowing. And I will chase it. And I've been lost before. And I have been led astray. But this time I'm here to stay"
a gentlemen's coup,"The pain, disorder. A cataclysmic dawn. We trusted but something has gone wrong. We bought it. But woke to find it gone. And have to five, four, three, two. The place before. The radiation creeps. On cats' feet. We scatter in the streets. She asks me ""do you think it's safe to breathe?"". It doesn't look that way to me. We storm the gates. Raise the flags. Just the same old story. We seize the throne. Subjugate. We should have burned it to the ground. Whoah. Some might say we've lost our way. But i believe we've not gone far enough. Afraid, we cower. To interests not our own. The power to free or to control. We let it skip through. Our fingers to the bone. Watch as the bodies wash ashore. Whoah. Nobody lives here anymore. We storm the gates. Raise the flags. Just the same old story. We seize the throne. Subjugate. We should have burned it to the ground. Whoah. Some might say we've lost our way. But i believe we've not gone far enough. And how long will we fall for this?. And how long will we fall for this?. How long will we fall for this?. And how long will we fall?. And how long will we fall for this?. And how long will we fall for this?. And how long will we fall for this?. How long, how?. We storm the gates. Raise the flags. Just the same old story. We seize the throne. Subjugate. We should have burned it to the ground. Whoah. Some might say we've lost our way. But i believe we've not gone far enough"

anywhere but here,"We've been alright up to now,. but the air that we breath is about to run out.. We've rehearsed our lines clear and loud,. but the cue never came and the lights,. they never went out.. So we're passing the time,. while time passes us.. The fast lanes a term never applied to us.. Without a dime to my name,. or a prayer in the world.. I walk out the door.. Destination anywhere but here.. Away from you.. Now I'm on my way to the other side,. (On my way). I'll forget everything I left behind.. (On my way). These empty rooms,. (On my way). are still filled with you.. (On my way). So I dropped out of my own race,. a race with no finish line,. no first or last place.. I watch these faces all run right past me.. I turn and walk away,. cause we finally know now what our. time here's about, we were not meant to be. another face in the crowd.. We're a forest of lives,. we grow tall and wide.. We won't ever be cut down.. Now I'm on my way to the other side,. (On my way). I'll forget everything I left behind.. (On my way). These empty rooms,. (On my way). are still filled with you.. (On my way). I'm so tired and turned around and scared.. I'm lying in empty beds again.. I'll wait for you to come. to your senses, barbed-wire fences. won't keep me from breaking through.. I swear I will for you.. Now I'm on my way to the other side,. (On my way). I'll forget everything I left behind.. (On my way). These empty rooms,. (On my way). are still filled with you..

architects,"Are there no fighters left here any more?. Are we the generation we've been waiting for?. Or are we patiently burning. Waiting to be saved?. Our heroes our icons. Have mellowed with age. Following rules. That they once disobeyed. Are now being led. When they used to lead the way. Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?. (that you stood by before). Are you up and on the front lines?. Or at home keeping score?. Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?. (the bricks that seal your fate). Would you rather be the architect of what we might create?. Go!. Laying out the blueprints. They pour down a base. Concrete solutions to slow our decay. But when they are gone, who the fuck's gonna take their place?. Yeah, will it be the cynic. The critics galore. You say ""how pathetic"", passed out on the floor. The trustee can visit. Who collectively ignored. Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?. (that you stood by before). Are you up and on the front lines?. Or at home keeping score?. Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?. (the bricks that seal your fate). Would you rather be the architect of what we might create?. Don't you remember when you were young?. And you wanted to set the world on fire?. Somewhere deep down, i know you do (hey hey hey hey). And all you remember when we were young. How we wanted to set the world on fire. Because i still am and i still do. Make no mistake we are not afraid. To bear the burden of repeating. What they're thinking anyway. Let's raise the stakes. On the bet we made. Let's decide to be the architects, the masters of our fate. Yeah, we still believe in all the things that we stood by before. (we stood by before). And now to everything we've seen here maybe even more. And i know we're not the only ones we were not the first. (we were not the first). Unapologetically we'll stand behind these words."
art of losing,I'm not fucking blind to the way. that you talk around the truth. not just what you say. but what you do. played this tug of war way too fucking long. like every time. again I've lost. you've won. you took advantage of the trust that I gave. took my forgiveness. rubbed it back in my face. reaching for words but there's nothing to say. I'm left to wonder. will this ever be the same. this rage. burning through my veins. regret consumes my mind. cutting deeply like a razor blade. will I live to see another day. without questioning your motives. with constant doubt. you took advantage of the trust that I gave. took my forgiveness. rubbed it back in my face. reaching for words. but there's nothing to say. I'm left to wonder. will this ever be the same. and as we sit back waiting. for these scars to heal. try to convince ourselves. that this. that this isn't real. will you allow me forget your past. or will you always hang it over my head
audience of one,"I can still remember. The words and what they meant. As we etched them with our fingers. In years of wet cement. Days blurred into each other. Though everything seemed clear. We cruised along at half speed. But then we shifted gears. We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns. But even then we should have stayed. But we ran away. Now all my friends are gone. Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved. Runaway. But what are we running from?. A show of hands from those in this audience of one. Where have they gone?. Identities assume us. As nine and five add up. Synchronizing watches. To the seconds that we lost. I now looked up and saw you. I know that you saw me. We froze but for a moment. In empathy. I brought down the sky for you but all you did was shrug. You gave my emptiness a name. But you ran away. Now all my friends are gone. Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved. Runaway. But what are we running from?. A show of hands from those in this audience of one. Where have they gone?. We're all ok, until the day we're not. The surface shines, while the inside rots. We raced the sunset and we almost won. We slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on. We ran away. Now all my friends are gone. Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved. Runaway. But what are we running from?. A show of hands from those in this audience of one. Where have they gone?"
awake too long,"I watched the rise and the fall of the common man. I lived to see all our steps walked back. I watched the walls all crash down crumbling. Just to be rebuilt while we slept. We threw swords in the oceans wide and deep. We promise peace but the peace won?t last. Because now we forge new blades so nervously. Waiting for this harmony to pass. I stand guard and roam. Like a sentinel and I see it all. I've been awake too long. Wish there was something. That could close my eyes. To all that I see. Awake too long. It would be easier. To fall asleep. We fell in love but the love kept running out. We followed roads but the roads all end. We lived and learned and learned to live without. Falling from the ladders we ascend. I've seen the eyes of the widows left behind. I've seen the child of a fallen man. And never once did our leaders apologize. For battles they began. I can't look away. Or pretend not to see and so I say. I've been awake too long. Wish there was something. That could close my eyes. To all that I see. Awake too long. It would be easier. To fall asleep, asleep. Maybe I would dream if I could sleep. Maybe I'd see what this could be. Instead of what it is. Is there bliss in ignorance. Is this our demise we can't prevent. Should we fall asleep?. I've been awake too long. And like constant vigils. We are burning eternal flames. A surgery. Blades in an open heart. And through it all it all. Every single cut. I've been awake."
ballad of hollis bown,Hollis brown. He lived on the outside of town. Hollis brown. He lived on the outside of town. With his wife and five children. And his cabin fallin' down. You looked for work and money. And you walked a rugged mile. You looked for work and money. And you walked a rugged mile. Your children are so hungry. That they don't know how to smile. Your baby's eyes look crazy. They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve. Your baby's eyes look crazy. They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve. You walk the floor and wonder why. With every breath you breathe. The rats have got your flour. Bad blood it got your mare. The rats have got your flour. Bad blood it got your mare. If there's anyone that knows. Is there anyone that cares?. You prayed to the lord above. Oh please send you a friend. You prayed to the lord above. Oh please send you a friend. Your empty pockets tell yuh. That you ain't a-got no friend. Your babies are crying louder. It's pounding on your brain. Your babies are crying louder now. It's pounding on your brain. Your wife's screams are stabbin' you. Like the dirty drivin' rain. Your grass it is turning black. There's no water in your well. Your grass is turning black. There's no water in your well. You spent your last lone dollar. On seven shotgun shells. Way out in the wilderness. A cold coyote calls. Way out in the wilderness. A cold coyote calls. Your eyes fix on the shotgun. That's hangin' on the wall. Your brain is a-bleedin'. And your legs can't seem to stand. Your brain is a-bleedin'. And your legs can't seem to stand. Your eyes fix on the shotgun. That you're holdin' in your hand. There's seven breezes a-blowin'. All around the cabin door. There's seven breezes a-blowin'. All around the cabin door. Seven shots ring out. Like the ocean's pounding roar. There's seven people dead. On a south dakota farm. There's seven people dead. On a south dakota farm. Somewhere in the distance. There's seven new people born

behind closed doors,"Chairs thrown and tables toppled,. Hands armed with broken bottles,. Standing no chance to win but,. We're not running, we're not running.. There's a point I think we're missing,. It's in the air we raise our fists in,. In the smiles we cast each other,. My sister, my brother.. About the time we gave up hope and. We never find these locks still open,. Stumbling on stones unturned,. The hurt we feel, we all have found.. The lives we've lost in such a change,. but all they see is treason. [Chorus:]. Although we have no obligation to stay alive. On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive. (Break out) I won't be left here. Behind closed doors.. Bonfires burn like beacons,. Guiding the lost and weakened.. Flames dance on crashing waves,. Guiding ships who've gone a stray. Time out, let's stop and think this through,. We've all got better things to do,. A talk in circles run in place,. Answers inches from my face.. [Chorus]. Black eyes, broken fingers,. Blood drips and I let it run. down my lips and to my swollen gums. When hope is non-existent,. Our instincts all scream ""Run"",. We never turn our backs or even bite our tongue.. [Chorus x2]. By Eduardo_sk8"
black masks and gasoline,"simply because you can breathe,. doesn't mean you're alive,. or that you really live,. this life here has taken its toll. and she just doesn't know how much more she can give. but here, at the top of the world, I raise my hands and I clench my fists,. they stand before me below demanding the answers with flips of a switch. I don't understand where you got this idea,. so deeply engrained in your head. that this world is something that you must impress,. because I couldn't care less. a need for revolution's rising, it comes to the surface, gasping for air,. we're not putting up with this planet one more day much less one more year. I don't understand where you got this idea,. so deeply engrained in your head. that this world is something that you must impress,. because I couldn't care less. so here and now, in our rotting nation. the blood, it pours, it's all on our hands now. we live, in fear, of our own potential. to win, to lose, it's all on our hands now. I have an American Dream,. but it involves black masks and gasoline,. one day I'll turn these thoughts into screams,. at a world turned its back down on me. I don't understand where you got this idea,. so deeply engrained in your head. that this world is something that you must impress,. because I couldn't care less. . Trazida até vocês Por: Xinez..."
blind,What if I'm right and you are wrong?. What if you knew it all along?. What if I figured out that I did not belong?. What if it always bothered me?. What if I never did believe?. Would it be wrong if I decided I should leave?. If I pretended I was blind. And struck it from my mind. Would it still be there?. What if I'd do anything to make it seem all right. It's all right. What if it's all inside my head?. What if those words were never said?. Would it be easier if I could just forget?. What if I didn't run away?. Could it be any other way?. Would it be wrong if I decided I should stay?. If I pretended I was blind. And struck it from my mind. Would it still be there?. What if I'd do anything to make it seem all right. It's all right.

blood to bleed,"This place rings with echoes of. Lives once lived but now are lost. Time spent wondering about tomorrow. I don’t care if we lose it all tonight. Up in flames, burning bright.

bridges,"In a world of uncertainty. The night sky told us all to be patient. But when the ground started shaking. I wondered for how long. But there's a place that I'd rather be. There's a voice deep inside me saying. The progress we are making. It's not progress at all. Into a world of promises (wo, oh!). Is where we let ourselves be led. We build the bridges. We now sleep under. We framed the doorways. But may not pass through. The very same roads. That we now wander. The ones you pass us by on. We paved with our bare hands. Paved with our bare hands. A black cloud hovers over me. But without all this guilt I feel naked. Something about the way it wraps it's arms around. White snow covers everything. An angel watches over me praying. She ask me for a favor. ""Catch me if I fall"". A rush of blood straight to the head (wo oh!). I wonder what this could have been. We build the bridges. We now sleep under. We framed the doorways. But may not pass through. The very same roads. That we now wander. The ones you pass us by on. We paved with our bare hands. Paved with our bare hands. Hey. No I never meant to hurt you. No I never meant to do you harm. I stood waiting but a man said ""move along"". We laid the tracks down. But now they rotted. Like a runaway train. We brace for the crash. We were in love once. Have you forgotten?. And like a runaway train. Bearing down upon a gap. We build the bridges. We build the bridges. We build the bridges. We build the bridges. And underneath its shadow. We now live"

Will you be there waiting, awake until sunrise.. I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days,. I, come from the same house, collapsed under this wing.. I know that's your sorrow, but I know mine,. So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight.. In the glow of twilight, our world is finally calm.. I felt it complete me, when the stars give way to dawn.. A language universal, but I speak not his tongue.. Is this a night that spins forever, or a dawn that never comes.. I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days,. I, come from the same house, collapsed under this wing.. I know that's your sorrow, but I know mine,. So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight.. Tomorrow we might wake in solitude and silence?. I will give you everything if you would only have me!. Tomorrow we will sweat and toil,. Our hands will quiver caked with soil,. Tomorrow we'll give it one last chance,. But tonight we dance,. But tonight we dance!. And for this, I travel in darkness, for what seems like days,. I, come from the same house, collapsed under this wing.. I know that's your sorrow, but I know mine,. Just say you'll stay and dance with me tonight."
chamber the cartridge,"Down beyond these city streets through gutters filled with black debris. In alleys void of any light where nameless things live out of sight. Down through the scrapers of the sky past neon words glowing all night. Echoes my name between each car, ""are you happy where you are?"". Blind to this impending fate. We let the world carry our weight. Its back breaks with every mile. But we all live in denial. Can we be saved? has the damage all been done?. Is it too late to reverse what we've become?. A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time. What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine. Let's go!. And so we carry on each day as if our lives were not so grey. While every breath that we take, we only suffocate. Brush past a myriad of scenes a homeless vet crashed. On wall street, a single mom of three, a tv personality. I'm blind to this impending fate. They let the world carry their weight. Its back breaks with every mile. But they all live in denial. Can we be saved? has the damage all been done?. Is it too late to reverse what we've begun?. A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time. What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine. Save us from what we have become tonight. Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right. Can we be saved? has the damage all been done?. Is it too late to reverse what we've become?. A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time. What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine!. And so we carry on each day,. as in our lives were not so real,. every breath that we take we only suffocate"
collapse (post amerika),"When our rivers run dry and our crops cease to grow. When our summer grow longer and winters won't snow. From the bank of the ocean and the ice in the hills.

Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes. Crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace. When the air that we breathe becomes air that we. choke. When the marsh fever spreads from the swamps to our homes. When your home on the range has been torn down and. paved and. The buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grave. What more will it take. For us to know. This is not a test, oh no. This is cardiac arrest. Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes. Kissin' the ground as we all fall from grace. This is a chance to set things straight. To bend or break the rules back into place. There is no middle ground, no compromise, we've drawn the line. With perfect aim, we stand back and throw. Glass windows break and it's all about to blow. Lights go out as we pass the torch again. In hope that stays lit. Neutrality means that you don't really care. Cuz the struggle goes on whether or not you're there. Blind and unaware. That's how we'll know. This is not a test, oh no. This is cardiac arrest. Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes. Crashing into the ground as we all,. Yeah we all, all fall from grace"

dead ringer,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). I never claimed to be something more than me,. your standards are something that I refuse to see,. I will answer only to myself,. so why don't you police someone else. the place I call home isn't there anymore,. with boards on the windows and locks on the door,. so pick up the pieces that never once fit,. let this be the end of it. once you held a place for me,. but now that I've left you went and gave up my seat,. don't expect me to share your visions of life,. I'll take the my chances somewhere else. the place I call home isn't there anymore,. with boards on the windows and locks on the door,. so pick up the pieces that never once fit,. let this be the end of it. give me the green light to get on with my life,. pick up the pieces then roll the fucking dice. I live in exile of you, your key no longer fits,. because the locks on my life are new"
dirt and roses,"This city grieves like widows clasping folded flags against their hearts. Raindrops spill like dirt and roses on black coffins in the dark. Not yet corpses, still we rot, oblivious to our decay. Drinking poison, drop by drop, descend to dark. Unless we save our lives. From the coming tide. That seeks to drown us in its waves. But if we sell our soul. For the chance of gold. Then we'll rue each passing day. And I swear this place once was alive. The streets all pulsed like living veins. Heart was beating cars with blood. The buildings breathe each time they sway. Time of death. Punctuated by the bells. The sky turned red. Then came the rain. Come on let's save our lives. From the coming tide. That seeks to drown us in its waves. But if we sell our soul. For the chance of gold. Then we'll rue each passing day.. They drown, they'll crush you from the top. I'd rather die,. I would rather chase them down. These worlds are crashing forward,. They try to set alight. Build our true fates while they drown. Like fallen soldiers on these fields. We spared our lives. Bodies holed up on the wheels. I swear we tried. I gave up on this godforsaken sight,. And felt it all pass by.. Come on let's save our lives. From the coming tide. That seeks to drown us in its waves. But if we sell our soul. for the chance of gold. then we'll rue each passing day.. So save our. (Save our lives). Our lives,. it's coming clear,. Yeah it's been coming clear. (Coming clear). To me.... We'll never sell our soul. For the chance of gold. And we'll live each passing day"
disparity by design,"Awake at the bottom. Of the barrels we cry out. So ashamed of our tears that. We blame only ourselves. That's when they win. They keep us convinced. To lift up our chins. These playing fields are level. We all have a chance. With that they dismiss. The fast lanes they row. What it takes, it depends on who you know. Or where you came from. Whose daughter are you?. Whose fortunate son?. Will it so. To stick up our bones. And piece from the letters. How we settled the crimes. Is this an over-reaching arm. Or is this compassion?. Is this a handout undeserved. Or a just reparation?. (a just reparation). Away from the towers. High above the ceiling tombs. Tell themselves. That they've earned this. Like working hard. Or playing by the rules. But this is only part true. A dangerous trick. Played on me and you. And so like a practical joke. We put on these bootstraps. So hard that they broke. Is this an over-reaching arm. Or is this compassion?. Is this a handout undeserved. Or a just reparation?. And like a single domino. That falls while the rest stay vertical. Will you fear these empty fairytales. Or will you believe them?. And if there's a god. You better pray. That this sleeping giant never wakes. If we just take a step back. A bigger picture we might view. Perhaps the man in the gutter. Is not so different from you. Come in, all of the cold. Forget all that you know. Because there's always been room. By the fire for you, oh. Come in, all of the cold. Will you believe them?. Is this an over-reaching arm. Or is this compassion?. Is this a handout undeserved. Or a just reparation?. And like a single domino. That falls while the rest stay vertical.

drones,"""Drones"". Deep inside these burning buildings. Voices die to be heard. Years we spent teaching a lesson. We ourselves had never learned. And if strength is borne from heartbreak. Many mountains I could move. And if walls could speak I’d pray. That they would tell me what to do. If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by.. Forget my name and I’ll forget it too.. Failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives,. Always keep me coming back to you.. No signs of life here, save the embers, the occasional flame,. We’d know the way but can’t remember, conception to the grave,. Jump confessions from the greatest heights, where no one can hear,. All my fears, my insecurities are falling like tears.. If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by.. Forget my name and I’ll forget it too.. Failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives,. Always keep me coming back to you.. The drones will slave away, they’re working overtime,. They serve a faceless queen, they never question why.. Disciples of a god, they neither live nor breathe,. (I won’t come back!). But we have bills to pay, yeah we have mouths to feed!. (I won’t come back!). I won’t come back!. If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by.. Forget my name and I’ll forget it too..

All the night with a light on.... Howling screams simulate. Things that no longer take place. Can this be what we've become?. Paper-thin, overweight. Pills to arouse us in tape. Still we don't know what we want. We can let go. Can't you see?. To lose control. Is to be. Falling free. First a spark. Then a flame. Now a fire!. We explode!. Into the darkest of nights,. Disconnect,. Cut the cord,. Lights are dead.. Now they'll know,. With everything comes a price!. And each day we are torn. Between the right and the wrong. Between life and convenience,. While you sleep, I'll complain. It's always channels and chains. It's like elective amnesia.. As we grow older,. In this place,. It's just all over. Life's a race.. What they make.. First a spark,. Then a flame,. Now a fire. We explode!. Into the darkest of nights. Disconnect. Cut the cord. Lights are dead. Now they'll know. With everything comes a price!. It could be minutes away. It could be hours or days. Before the bottom falls out. Before the ground gets away. Into this debt we are born. A debt we try to repay. And yet we blacken the sky. Smoke rising out of the flames. Now they'll know.... First a spark!. Then a flame!. Now a fire!. We explode!. Into the darkest of nights!. Disconnect!. Cut the cord!. Lights are dead!. Now they'll know. With everything comes a price!. We explode!. We explode!. With everything comes a price!. We explode!. We explode..."
endgame,"And on that day they'll tell you. That life hummed on with no clue. The warning signs were all just missed or shattered down. So it goes. The kings all failed to tell us. The madmen failed to sell us. Of what would then befall the only life we know. Would they burning signal fires. To guide us to the fields. Or building funeral pyres. They outcome of a final appeal. The city lines are down. The kerosene's run out. The fracturing of all we relied upon. Let's shed this unclean skin. And start to feel again. Cuz all the shoulders on which to cry are gone. The paranoia gripped us. The rain turned engines to rust. The panic set in like a cancer to our hearts. Spreading through. We bet on finite genius. Or prayed for god to save us. But there was no antidote. Disease tore us apart. We left bodies in the fields. So numb that we forgot how to feel. The city lines are down. The kerosene's run out. The fracturing of all we relied upon. Let's shed this unclean skin. And start to feel again. Cuz all the shoulders on which to cry are gone. He looked at the fields, and then his hands. All I need is what I have. Then fell a tear of happiness. Oh.... She watched the world crumble away. Is this the end of yesterday?. ""Lord, I hope so"" is all he said. All gone are the old guards. gone are the cold, cold wars. Weightless we go forth. On wings of amnesty. All we relied on now. The city lines are down. The kerosene's run out. The fracturing of all we relied upon. Let's shed this unclean skin. And start to feel again. With no more shoulders, shoulders to cry on now. No more, no more. No more, no more. No more, no more.

But can't you see the end is coming soon. Come one come all, the new sensation. Guarantees then obligations. Spotlights follow every single move. Basking here on ten foot stages. Pouty lips and oh so jaded. All as if we have something to prove. Despite these petty fortunes. We still can't afford a life. Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms. They all scream California and it's toppling empire. But can't you see the end is here. And if we cared at all about this unknown plight. Then we'd do something more to finally make this right. This is only entertainment. Pull the curtains, places please. We learned to sing and dance and cry on cue. But this is more than entertainment. In a world so sick with pain.

Its the lottery of life. We all better just get by. Some of us escaped. Found a better way, a better life. The ones that got away now. Drifted from the heart. Sliped through the fingers of your bone. The ones that got away now. Never to return. We left your world, to build our world. And off to creep we're building. Able but unwilling. To bound to this desing. There is a light, there is a way out. Safe before we all drown. The boundaries have been redefined. We are brothers of a place. Paradise of petty raised. A wilderness awaits. Have lost something we've been trying to find. The ones that got away now. Drifted from the heart. Sliped through the fingers of your bone. The ones that got away now. Never to return. We left your world, to build our world. Give up our place. Relying to run so far away. To break free from. This silence race its never a one. This silence peace we kept our run. The place getting closer. We'll keep our composure. We are the ones that got away now. Drifting from the heart. We are the ones that got away now. Never to return. And from your clutches we're escaping. Yeah from your grip, we are breaking free. We got away. Yeah, got away. We got away. Yeah"
everchanging,"In the face. Of change. That's when she turned to me and said. ""I'm not sure anymore"". And there. Amidst the waves and the cloudless skies. That blanket the year before. I watch my life wash ashore. Have you ever been a part of something. That you thought would never end?. And then, of course it did. Have you ever felt the weight inside you. Pulling away inside your skin?. And then something had to give. Now the lines are drawn. Is this feeling gone?. The best parts of this have come and gone. And now that is all this is. With the reasons clear. We'll spend another year. Without direction, full of fear. And now things will be different. There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I. Always something in this everchanging life. And there probably always will. Now that time is getting harder to come by,. The same arguments are always on our mind. Killed this slowly fading light. Now the lines are drawn. Is this feeling gone?. The best parts of this have come and gone. And now that is all this is. With the reasons clear. We'll spend another year. Without direction, full of fear. But now things will be different. And now something. Has kept me here too long. And you can't leave me. If I'm already gone. Well now something (hey). Has kept me here too long. And you can't leave me (hey). If I'm already gone. Now let's say that something (hey). Has kept me here too long. And you can't leave me (hey). If I'm already gone. Now say we make the same mistakes. We're always hanging on. Break the promises. We're always leaning on. All this time spent waking up. Keep this line open. To get this call from you. Speak the words that keep. Me coming back to you. Now this time it's all different. Now something. Has kept me here too long. And now I'm gone"
faint resemblance,"Wait,. I'm not listening to you now. I wasn't listening to you then.

I don't know how much of me you expect standing here right now. I beg for you to let go. I dread the day you finally do. I fight for your attention. too little too late. or too much too soon. and how will this plague the time. we share from here on out. and how long will this taint. all these words spilling from my mouth. have we been here before?. will we be here again?.

far from perfect,"Keeping up appearances. Don't break now or buckle from the weight. Pretend to laugh but don't laugh too loud. Do you feel the pressure building. The anger spilling out now. Meanwhile the cracks have formed on. The masks we've worn up 'til now. We are far from perfect but perfect as we are. We are bruised, we are broken. But we are goddamn works of art. Works of art. The pieces of our hearts all gravitated. Together but before we could be part of. This mosaic we had to break apart. Like glass we're falling faster than stars. Meanwhile the cracks have formed on. The masks we've worn up 'til now. Take a look. We are far from perfect but perfect as we are. We are bruised, we are broken. We are goddamn works of art. In every color we shine. A tapestry of scars with every thread. We're growing stronger and moving onward. We're finding right ways despite the wrong ones. We're clearing paths blocked by storms. We're finding the beauty in what you've ignored. We are far from perfect but perfect as we are. We are far from perfect but perfect as we are. We are bruised, we are broken.

This is a war that was lost the day that it began. Because it's the race we run,. but it keeps us at the start. It's the song I sung from the bottom of my heart,. That's how we. Read You.

grammatizator,"We celebrate the downfall with ticker tape parades. Oblivious to the fucking mess left lying in the wake. ""God grant me the strength to let my children starve"". He whispered to the dripping roof into the candled dark. Contemplate contracts of gold. Just wave your hand and relinquish control. Nine lives await to unfold. We bury ten thousand stories untold. Flirt with insurrection batting eyes from afar. In skybox seats or hotel suites, six figure fucking cars. Contemplate contracts of gold. Just wave your hand and relinquish control. Nine lives await to unfold. Bury the stories. Control the heart. Control the mind. Control the hands. To build what they've designed. Lifetimes of silence and apathy. Ensure the prompt demise of our humanity. Contemplate contracts of gold. Just wave your hand and relinquish control. Nine lives await to unfold. We bury ten thousand stories. The stories untold. byLéoPS"
great awakening,(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). Buried words. under lights. soundtrack to this stagnant life. this meaning lost in translation. message sucked out of his hands again. This could be my great awakening. but how would I know. cuz it's all noise to me. are these words falling on deaf ears?. Staring at the empty stares. realize that he no longer cares about the wrong or right. the downward spiral begins tonight. And this could be my great awakening. but how would I know cuz it's all noise to me. are these words falling on deaf ears?. This could be my great awakening. but how would I know cuz it's all noise to me. nothing I can do will make you hear
hairline fracture,"A sinking ship an awkward kiss. A chance to set things straight. The kind of hurt that burns and burns. Like fires we can?t contain. We hole up in a shelter made of bones and ice and. there we?ll wait. So start again with steady hands. This time nothing gets in our way. But as we peer a little closer what do we see?. A crack in the surface. A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost. buried in the sand). A cadence imperfect. Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves. If we don?t face what we?re against). A promise kept. The dirt unswept. A poorly worn disguise. A child unloved that then grows up. To love what we despise. We?re broken but still breathing. We are wounded but we are healing. We pick up right where we left off. Breathe on the ashed that remain. So that these coals may become fire. To guide our way. A crack in the surface. A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost. buried in the sand). A cadence imperfect. Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves. If we don?t face what we?re against). I walk on wounds that seldom prove to slow me down. I laugh this constant pain away. So you can?t tell. But there it lies under the smiles. It drains me mile after mile. But seldom proves to slow me down. Here I go. Should we just hold on. To what remains of. What we thought was lost. But it's just a crack in the surface. A flaw in the plan (plans we made together, almost. buried in the sand). A cadence imperfect. Like a building condemned (can we indemnify ourselves. If we don?t face what we?re against)"
halfway there,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). Is this the point where we give up?. Is this the point where we give in?. Is this the point where we turn ourselves in?. Is this the time to ask questions?. Is this the time to seek answers?. Is this the time to throw it all in?. When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there. When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there. You're halfway there. That's when you know that you're halfway there. This is the point where we stand up. This is the point where we take back. The things that are keeping us from being free. When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there. When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there. That's when you know that you're halfway there. Your voice the airwaves sent you prayed my life would end,. The wasted time I spent ashamed I called you friend,. Give me one reason, I need a reason, one reason"
heaven knows,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). The day I learn to fly, I'm never coming down. on perfect wings I'll rise through the layers of the clouds. and from there I see the neon grids of cities. and six million people that keep their fires lit. I threw a party in my name. but the hours crawled by and no one came. so I bowed my head and I prayed for wings. to take me from this place... from you. I see myself inside you, you dream the dreams that I do,. you're still searching for these answers, they're not inside your wrist. and from there I see the neon grids of cities. and six million people that keep their fires lit. I threw a party in my name. but the hours crawled by and no one came. so I bowed my head and I prayed for wings. to take me from this place... from you. I close my eyes as the curtains draw,. I thought I heard your voice but I thought wrong,. 'cause you're not there anymore,. no you're not there anymore. and so I lift my chin and the show goes on,. the sky is listening, the stars all sing along,. but you're not there anymore,. and I just can't care anymore"
help is on the way,"I have my mother's dreams. I have my father's eyes. You can't take that from me. Just go ahead and try. The crescent city sleeps. While giants in the sky. Preparing to unleash. Let loose a might cry. Can nobody save us?. Will anyone try?. The bayou is burning. The cypress has died. And all along they're saying. ""Help is on the way"", they said. They said, ""Help is on the way"", they said. They said one by land two by sea. Right there in front of me. Help is on the way. Five thousand feet below. As black smoke engulfs the sky. The ocean floor explodes. Eleven mothers cry. My bones all resonate. A burning lullaby. You can't take that from me. Just go ahead and try. She stands at the shoreline. With hands in the air. Her words pierce the dark light. ""Does anyone care?"". And along they're saying. ""Help is on the way"", they said. They said, ""Help is on the way"", they said. They said one by land two by sea. Right there in front of me. Help is on the way. Right here, Right here. Right here, Right here. Right here, Right here. Choking on the black gold. Upon which we rely. We keep axes in the attics. To see cameras in the sky. Help is on the way. They said help is on the way. We were told just to sit tight because. Somebody will soon arrive. Help is on the way. But it never came. It never came. ""Help is on the way"", they said. They said, ""Help is on the way"", they said. They said one by land two by sea. Right there in front of me. Help is on the way. On the way"

Black leather boots. Spit-shined so bright. They cut off my hair but it looked alright. We marched and we sang. We all became friends. As we learned how to fight. A hero of war. Yeah that's what I'll be. And when I come home. They'll be damn proud of me. I'll carry this flag. To the grave if I must. Because it's flag that I love. And a flag that I trust. I kicked in the door. I yelled my commands. The children, they cried. But I got my man. We took him away. A bag over his face. From his family and his friends. They took off his clothes. They pissed in his hands. I told them to stop. But then I joined in. We beat him with guns. And batons not just once. But again and again. A hero of war. Yeah that's what I'll be. And when I come home. They'll be damn proud of me. I'll carry this flag. To the grave if I must. Because it's flag that I love. And a flag that I trust. She walked through bullets and haze. I asked her to stop. I begged her to stay. But she pressed on. So I lifted my gun. And I fired away. The shells jumped through the smoke. And into the sand. That the blood now had soaked. She collapsed with a flag in her hand. A flag white as snow. A hero of war. Is that what they see. Just medals and scars. So damn proud of me. And I brought home that flag. Now it gathers dust. But it's a flag that I love. It's the only flag I trust. He said, ""Son, have you seen the world?. Well what would you say, if I said that you could?"""

i don't want to be here anymore,"On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall. We count the days scrathing lines on the wall. Waiting the wings at someone's back and call.

And I don't want to be here. Anymore. On hand and foot we answered every single call. And wethered every day like passing storms. But when they break we will all be gone. Won't back down. Won't take no for answers anymore. These walls close. We pace back and forth. I don't want to be here anymore. I know there's nothing left worth staying for. Your paradise is something I've endured. Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh. See, I don't think I can fight this anymore. I'm listening with one foot out the door. And something has to die to be reborn. And I don't want to be here. Anymore.

Try to recover, but collide with each other. We spin out of control. Something I cannot change. I was born in a place. That lives by the sword. And thus to it's blade we're condemned. Don't you understand why we scream Â?no moreÂ? ?. My dreams are of children. Orphaned by blood. Spilled at these hands. Here on the graves of the innocent. We raise our flag. Spin out of control. Spin out of control. Try to recover, but collide with each other. We spin out of control. Some things you don't forgive some things you don't forget. Sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death. We're way off course now and we're drifting out to sea. So cut the anchor on your heart to be set free. Spin out of control.

While the world sleeps we are awake. The black brook calls. It sings a chorus. While the gathering swells. The flames grow tall. Right before us. As drums keep pounding. And the masses now are fusing. Bodies pressed and tangled. As we revel in confusion. Our inhibitions thrown into the fire. [CHORUS]. Come raise your lantern to the sky. Can we illuminate this night?. We'll dance like heathens round a flame. While the world sleeps we are awake. Here in the dark we are safe from the judgement. Now arm in arm locked tight so no one gets in. The hell is sent. See, child, you are hellbent. But hell is not where we're going. Hell is where we've been. [CHORUS]. Come raise your lantern to the sky. And let's illuminate this night. We'll dance like heathens around the flame. And while the world sleeps we are awake. Raise your lantern to the sky. And let's illuminate this night. We'll dance like heathens around the flames.

If in time we find ourselves,. Back where we started from,. Too weak to fight and much too tired to run. Before you swallow me. Into your perfect life,. I'm not going out without a fight, yeah!. One last chance to go,. If I don't leave tonight I never will. One last chance to go,. Let's take it now in for the kill. But this blueprints faded grey. And here it seems like just yesterday. When we mapped out the details of our great escape,. But still these roads all beckon me. To uncover their mystery. But I fall like dead autumn leaves and let the jetstream carry me. One last chance to go,. If I don't leave tonight I never will. One last chance to go"
life less frightening,"Suffering from something we're not sure of. In a world there is no cure for. These lives we live test negative for happiness. Flat line, no pulse, but eyes open. Single file like soldiers on a mission. If theres no war outside our heads. Why are we losing?. [Chorus: x2]. I don't ask for much. Truth be told I'd settle. for a life less frightening, a life less frightening. Hang me out to dry I'm soaking. With the sins of knowing. What's gone wrong but doing nothing I still run. time again I have found myself stuttering. Foundations pulled out from under me. This breath is wasted on them all. will someone answer me. [Chorus x2]. Is there a God tonight?. up in the sky or is it empty just like me (Just like me). A place where we can hide out from the night. Where you are all I see (Where you are all I see). So all he says, Goodbye, and close your eyes. Tell me what you see (Tell me what you see). A life I sit inside this dream of mine. where you are all I see. [Chorus x2]"
like the angel,"They turn the lights down low,. In shadows hiding from the world,. Only coming out when it gets cold. The seas part when they hit the floor,. The voices carry on and out the door. And everything you touch turns into gold. Like the angel you are, you laugh creating a lightness in my chest,. Your eyes they penetrate me,. (Your answer's always 'maybe'). That's when I got up and left. A beating heart and a microphone,. A ticking clock in an empty home. Still tells of these times so long ago,. And even though I've come so far, I know. I've got so far to go and any day now I'll explode. Like the angel you are, you laugh creating a lightness in my chest,. Your eyes they penetrate me,. (your answer's always 'maybe'). That's when I got up and left. And each and everyday will lead into tomorrow. And tomorrow brings one less day without you. But don't wait up just leave the light on. Cause all the roads that I might take will all. One day lead back to you. And like the angel you are, you laugh creating a lightness in my chest,. Your eyes they penetrate me,. (never cease to amaze me). That's when I got up and left"
long forgotten sons,"Far from home on a road unknown. Where the vultures circle on winds that blow. From northern skies that haunt these waking moments. On shadows cast by the mountain range. On calloused soles we find our way. Through desperate eyes, we long for the horizon. While this sun is rising. We are the long forgotten sons. And daughters that don’ belong to anyone. We are alone under this sun. We work to fix the work that you’ve undone. When cries for help go unanswered. And signal fires just burn and burn. We wonder if we’re waiting here for nothing. Our lips are sewn our ears are filled. With the constant drone of the unfulfilled. But we’ll never fall if we stand for something. We stand for something. We are the long forgotten sons. And daughters that don’ belong to anyone. We are alone under this sun. We work to fix the work that you’ve undone. Don’t fall, I see lights in the distance. They’re not far away. Stand up because the sky is turning gray. There’s hope in these footsteps of persistence. So don’t go astray. These lights get closer everyday. We are the long forgotten sons. And daughters that don’ belong to anyone. We are alone under this sun. We work to fix the work that you’ve undone. What you’ve undone. (what happens now, we don’t know, just hold on tight now here we go…)"
make it stop (september's children),"Woah, woah.. Bang bang go the coffin nails. Like a breath exhaled,. Then gone forever.. It seems like just yesterday. How did I miss the red flags raised?. Raise these back to the days we left.. We braved these bitter storms together.. Brought to his knees he cried,. But on his feet he died.. What god would damn a heart?. And what god drove us apart?. What god could.... Make it stop. Let this end.. Eighteen years pushed to the ledge.. It's come to this,. A weightless step.. On the way down singing,. Woah, woah.. Bang bang from the closet walls,. The schoolhouse halls,. The shotgun's loaded.. Push me and I'll push back.. I'm done asking, I demand.. From a nation under god,. I feel it's love like a cattle prod.. Born free, but still they hate.. Born me, no, I can't change.. It's always darkest just before the dawn.. So stay awake with me. Let's prove them wrong.. Make it stop.. Let this end,. Eighteen years pushed to the ledge.. It's come to this,. A weightless step.. On the way down singing,. Woah, woah.. The cold river washed him away,. But how could we forget.. Gathering some candles, but not their tongues.. And too much blood has flown from the wrist,. Of the children shamed. For those they chose to kiss.. Who will rise to stop the blood.. We're coming for,. Insisting on, a different beat, yeah.. A brand new song.. Woah, woah.. Woah, woah.. Woah, woah.. Make it stop.. Let this end,. This life choose me. I'm not lost in sin. The bare I stand of who I am. I'll plan to go on living. Make it stop.. Let this end,. All these years pushed to the ledge.. The bare I stand of who I am. I'll plan to go on living"

megaphone,"Stick to your guns. They fail to protect. I've seen this before and we die in the end. Leapt without looking. We land in the flames. We don't even care anymore. Are you tired of being ignored?. Speak up now, you are not alone. This is not a joke, pick up the megaphone. Think out loud, what are you waiting for?. Clear your goddamn throat. You are the megaphone. Don't wait, don't turn away. Don't choke on words you meant to say. Speak up now, you are not alone. This ain't a fucking joke. Pick up the megaphone, Yeah, Hey!.

methadone,"Love like a needle full of methadone. Potent, but not real, left you wanting more. Lipstick track marks bleeding wet. Like Montagues and Capulets. For us child, the stars refuse to shine. Oh why for us child the stars refuse to shine?. Somewhere strung-out on the land. We wound up back here again. Like unstable chemicals. Combining only to explode. What would it take for you to notice?. That I am a heart on fire. And all the world's the fuse, so don't get close. Trouble and the worth. Am I better off on my own?. Contaminated quarantine, then left alone. A shipment refused, address unkown. Damaged goods they soon forget. In choking dust where we got left. For us all the stars refuse to shine. So tap the vein and light the match. We burn like stars before the crash. But for you there's still a chance. Just let go. What would it take for you to notice?. That I am a heart on fire. And all the world's the fuse, so don't get close. Trouble and the worth. I am better off on my own. On my own. Now there's no way to run. And yeah there's nowhere to hide. There's nothing under the sun. We haven't already tried. What would it take for you to notice?. What I am a hand grenade. Pin already pulled so don't let go. As we chase the sun, my shadow slows us down. Without me along, you're better off. And I know, you're better off. And I know, and I know"
midnight hands,"Like a new day rising,. Like a calm before the storm.. Like fog lifting from valleys,. On the sleeping forest floor. Eyes open slowly as the dust is shaken off. To gaze upon the wreckage. That the midnight hands have wrought. And now I feel my temperature rising. my body explode. I feel like somebody's watching. like I'm not alone. I stopped, I vowed right then and said that. Whatever path you take. and wherever you might go. Whenever you decide you to leave. I'll follow, I'll follow. We face the crossroads never knowing what's in store. There's an angel on my shoulder. There's a devil in my door. She proclaimed tonight will be the greatest of our lives. I said 'don't be so sure, let's just wait until the morning light'. I feel my temperature rising. my body explode. I feel like somebody's watching. like I'm not alone. I stopped, I vowed right then and said that. Whatever path you take. and wherever you might go. Whenever you decide you to leave. I'll follow, I'll follow. There in the clearing we gather close. Under the moon's pale light we lay out the tools. And you don't have to do this, and I forgive you if you don't. She just looked away and said 'I know'. Gripping the midnight hands. We dream of futures they would prevent. Gripped by the midnight hands. The line's crossed over, the dawn grows closer. Let's bit off too much. Let's jump with a blind trust. In water over our head. Whatever path you take. And wherever you might go. Whenever you decide to leave. I'll follow, I'll follow. I won't bet on the falls you take (the falls you take). I won't let go if you started to stray. I'll be there until you don't wake up, yeah. I'll follow. I will follow. I will follow. Whatever path you take (I will follow). Wherever you might go (I will follow). Whenever you decide to leave (I will follow)"
miracle,"We scan the empty sky always without success. We're lighting signal fires and spelling Sos. We stare at broken clocks. The truth comes twice a day. While every second just slips away. Are you going to wait here for a sign to let you know now?. Are you going to sit there paralyzed by what you've seen?. Or are you going to finally grip the wheel?. I think you know how. Is this more than you expected it to be?. Don't wait for a miracle to tumble from the sky. To part the seas around you or turn water into wine. Don't wait for a miracle, the world is passing by. The walls that all surround you are only in your mind. The stage is set and the curtains pulled. Ready or not, it's time, on with the show. Now the crowds have grown impatient. And the train has left the station. And the candles you are lighting in the dark will fade away. So what are you waiting for?. A sign to let you know now?. Are you gonna sit there paralyzed by what you've seen?. Are you going to finally grip the wheel?. I think you know how. Are you gonna throw it all away?. Don't wait for a miracle to tumble from the sky. To part the seas around you or turn water into wine. Don't wait for a miracle the world is passing by. The walls that all surround you are only in your mind. When the weight we carry breaks us. We're tempted to stay down. But every road to recovery. Starts at the breakdown. But we don't need miracles to tumble from the sky. To part the seas around us or turn water into wine. Because we are the miracles, we happen all time. We're not scared of what surrounds us. We're not waiting for a sign. We are the miracles!. We are the miracles!. We are the miracles!. Hey!"
mourning amerika,"Stand by to switch on. We fire on all pistons. We're singing along. But no one is listening. From dusk until dawn. We stay up to carry the flame. And when it's all said and done. In these alternate endings. When nothing is left but the stragglers and empties. We're sleeping it off just to wake up and start it again. So burn the statues to the ground. It's time to lay your weapons down. Bound for glory on this train. But there's a bridge out up ahead. Noise cancel, drown the signal out. Change channels, manufacture doubt. When the only thing we'll fight for ever day. Is a better seat on a crashing. Plain to see but hard to breathe. The streets are full of tumbleweeds. And now it's morning in the streets of amerika. But we don't go outside anymore. The radio blasts hysteria. With a television sideways on the floor. Under moonlit skies and surveillance. As we cheer from the stands in the stadiums. On a jumbotron. We all sing along to escape. Once we were the lighthouse. To the world's most desperate ships. But what we became was a towering flame. Leading the moth right into it. Now we are waking up to the phone lines cut. Because it's morning in the streets of amerika. And we don't go outside anymore. The radio blasts hysteria. While the television's sideways on the floor. With the teleprompter in our faces. We don't even know what we're saying. A car that's slowly crashing. And we can't look away. Parading to the edge of a cliff now and trying to. Figure out how to get down. While the night is fast approaching. Will we even recognize our former lives in this artificial light?. Morning in the streets of amerika. And we don't go outside anymore. There's something wrong with the stereo. And the television's sideways. We're mourning in the streets of amerika. Mourning in the streets of amerika. We're mourning in the streets of amerika. Mourning in the streets of amerika"
my life inside your heart,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). Fighting back the impulse. turn my head and close my eyes,. Spending these nights awake and cold and paralyzed,. Wonder how we got this far and never realized,. The common thread that binds our lives,. And I know you hurt. but I can help you if you can.... Take my hand!. and we'll live inside the dreams we left behind. Take my hand!. as we move from this place to a better life. Take my hand!. (If you take my hand). Fighting back the feeling that you always could deny. Anything but everything we know is just a lie. As I cremate this memory and watch the darkened ashes rise. And beneath the smoke. I'll stand,. And ask you if you can. Take my hand!. And I'll promise not to ever let it go. Take my hand!. 'Cause this hope is greater than you'll ever know. Take my haaaaand.... And this is all I'll ever ask of you to show.... Fight back the urges. Turn my head and close my eyes. And will I wake tomorrow still alive. I'm still dreaming. I'm still waiting. I'm still sure. (I'm still sure!). You're still living in a life. That isn't yours. (That isn't yours!). And this is part of me. I hope you never see. This is my life inside your heart. Take my hand!. and I'll promise not to ever let it go. Take my hand!. 'Cause this hope is greater than you'll ever know. Take my haaaand.... And this is all I'll ever ask of you to show..."
nervous breakdown,"I'm about to have a nervous breakdown. My head really hurts. If I don't find a way out of here. I'm gonna go berserk cause. I'm crazy and I'm hurt. Head on my shoulders. It's going... Berserk!. I hear the same old talk talk talk. The same old lines. Don't do me that today. Yeah if you know what's good for you, you'll get out of my way. Cause, I'm crazy and I'm hurt. Head on my shoulders. Going... Berserk!. I won't apologize. For acting outta line. You see the way I am. You leave any time you can cause. I'm crazy and I'm hurt. Head on my shoulders. Going... Berserk!. Crazy! Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!. I don't care what you fuckin' do!. I don't care what you fuckin' say!. I'm so sick of everything. I just want to... Die!"
obstructed view,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). To all you people standing proud, thinking you know what I’m about:. I think you can fuck yourself. From your safe distance in this crowd. That’s when your voice becomes so loud. Still trying to keep us down. Walk one mile in shoes I never asked to fill. But still press on….. I slipped, I fell, then I lost everything. My hope, my faith, in what the future brings. In hopes of pushing past the ties that keeps us down. We sing together now.. Give me one reason to look you in the eye. Tell me exactly why it is that you think you are worth my time. To all the ones that shakes my hand. Then talk your shit behind my back. To those who claim they understand. But never heard a word of what I said. In spite of you I am still here. This vision has never been more clear. As we sing together now."
paper wings,"One last thing I beg you please just before you go. I've watched you fly on paper wings halfway around the world. Until they burned up in the atmosphere and sent you spiraling down. Landing somewhere far from here with no one else. around to catch you falling down. And I'm looking at you now. And I can't tell if you're laughing. Between each smile there's a tear in your eye. There's a train leaving town in an hour. It's not waiting for you, and neither am I. ""Swing for the fences, son"" he must have told you. once. But that was a conversation you took nothing from. So raise your glass now, let's celebrate exactly what you've done. Just put off another day of knowing where you're from. You can catch up with yourself if you run.... And I can't tell if you're laughing. Between each smile there's a tear in your eye. There's a train leaving town in an hour. It's not waiting for you, and neither am I. Is this the life that you lead,. Or the life that's lead for you?. Will you take the road that's been laid out before. you?. Will we cross paths somewhere else tonight?. Somewhere else tonight.... And I can't tell if you're laughing. Between each smile there's a tear in your eye. There's a train leaving town in an hour. It's not waiting for you, and neither am I. And I can't tell if you're laughing. Between each smile there's a tear in your eye. There's a train leaving town in an hour. It's not waiting for you, and neither am I..."
parts per million,"There's something wrong. With the words that we're not saying. And the silence we're creating. Like a ghost note symphony. There's something wrong. And the temperature is rising. Ignoring every siren. As we're marching towards a cliff. But these are choices. That we don't have to make. Block out the voices. 'Cause they have led you astray. What I've been trying to say to you. Is that there's something in the water. There must be something in the air. Just 'cause I can't put my finger on it. It doesn't mean that, that it's not there. Yeah, we are all turned on. But then we all tune out. As we are hypnotized. By the sparkling lies. We fall under their spell. But don't forget that these are choices. That we don't have to make. So many voices. That have led us astray. We can't keep anything down. The room is spinning around. There must be something in the water. Yeah, there's something in the air. Just 'cause I can't put my finger on it. It doesn't mean that, that it's not there!. You are the grains of sand. That slip through my hands again. And we are the hourglass. Love like a flame that can't be held. Somewhere beyond the lives we burn. Lies the point of no return. Like the sand within the hourglass. (But there is something on!). (But there is something on!). But there is something in your eyes. That shakes me back to life. And though I can't put my finger on it. Now I know we're gonna be alright!. It's gonna be alright!. It's gonna be alright!. 'Cause there is something in the water. Yeah there is something in the water. In this life. We sink or swim or just float. We all die. Yeah, but did we live at all?"
people live here,"My God is better than yours. And the walls of my house are so thick. I hear nothing at all. I followed you out in the storm. But it carried you off. And I burned every picture of yours. Is that not enough?. My gun is bigger than yours. So lets arm the masses. And see what the bastards do then. Walking tall once set us apart. Now we down on all fours. Do you cry my name in the dark?. Like I do yours?. The storms are getting stronger now. Trusses all bend and sway. Lightning hits, the power goes out in the fray. As the wave crash high. And the shoreline disappears. I will scream to the sky. Hey people live here!. My dreams are not unlike yours. Their long for the safety. And break like a glass chandelier. But there's laughter and oh there is love. Just pass the edge of our fears. And there's chaos when push comes to shove. But is music to my ears. May you be in heaven. Before the devil know's you're dead. May these winds be always at your back. 'Cause when we all just ghosts. And the madness overtakes us. We will look at the ashes. And say people lived here. From the penthouse. To the holy martyr. Sea to shining sea. From the coffins full of kindergarteners. Is this what you call free?. From the hate that drips from all your crosses. Are your hands so clean. There's a wildfire and is spreading far. From to sea to shining sea. When we all just ghosts. And the madness overtakes us. I will scream to the sky. Yeah I'll scream to the sky. Yeah I'll scream to the sky. ""Hey, people live here! """
politics of love,"I hear your voice in the wind. It follows me, it cuts right through the noise. As we spin on dance floors made of ice. So rest your hand in mine. Steady now, ignore the sound. The breaking lines. The crack beneath our feet as time runs out. Each night like a white noise frequency. Broadcast the waves, I tune them out. Clear signs outlined. But I couldn't see what I see now. I should've said something to you. When I saw you walk away. Instead I did nothing. And now you're gone and it's too late. We board up the windows we used to look through. I should've said something. I should've said something to you. Like buried seeds in the ground. Invisible but growing. Underneath pushing out. Now tangled in the vine, I hear the sound. Heartbeats from a world so far away. The distant drums, I tune them out. Each night right before I fall asleep. I hear them now. I should've said something to you. When I saw you walk away. Instead I did nothing. And now you're gone and it's too late. So we board up the windows we used to look through. I should've said something. Yeah, I should've said something to you!. I should've said something. Yeah, I should've said something. So we board up the windows we used to look through. I should've said something. I should've said something. I should've said something. Yeah, I should've said something to you!. To you!"
prayer of the refugee,"""Prayer Of The Refugee"". Warm yourself by the fire, son,. And the morning will come soon.. I'll tell you stories of a better time,. In a place that we once knew.. Before we packed our bags. And left all this behind us in the dust,. We had a place that we could call home,. And a life no one could touch.. Don't hold me up now,. I can stand my own ground,. I don't need your help now,. You wont let me down, down, down!. Don't hold me up now,. I can stand my own ground,. I don't need your help now,. You wont let me down, down, down!. Down!. We are the angry and the desperate,. The hungry, and the cold,. We are the ones that kept quiet,. And always did what we were told.. But we've been sweating while you slept so calm,. In the safety of your home.. We've been pulling out the nails that hold up. Everything you've known.. Don't hold me up now,. I can stand my own ground,. I don't need your help now,. You wont let me down, down, down!. Don't hold me up now,. I can stand my own ground,. I don't need your help now,. You wont let me down, down, down!. So open your eyes child,. Let's be on our way.. Broken windows and ashes. Are guiding the way.. Keep quiet no longer,. We'll sing through the day,. Of the lives that we've lost,. And the lives we've reclaimed.. Don't hold me up now,. I can stand my own ground,. I don't need your help now,. You wont let me down, down, down!. Don't hold me up now,. I can stand my own ground,. I don't need your help now,. You wont let me down, down, down!. Don't hold me up.... (I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground). Don't hold me up.... (I don't need your help). No! No! No!. Don't hold me up!.

re-education (through labor),To the sound of a heartbeat pounding away. To the rhythym of the awful rusted machines. We toss and turn but don't sleep. Each breath we take makes us thieves. Like causes without rebels. Just talk but promise nothing else. We crawl on our knees for you. Under a sky no longer blue. We sweat all day long for you. But we sow seeds to see us through. Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true. We wait to reap what we are due. To the rhythym of a time bomb ticking away. And the blare of the sirens combing the streets. Chased down like dogs we run from. Your grasp until the sun comes up. We crawl on our knees for you. Under a sky no longer blue. We sweat all day long for you. But we sow seeds to see us through. Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true. Look now at what they've done to you. White needles buried in the red. The engine roars and then it gives. But never dies. 'Cuz we don't live. We just survive. On the scraps that you throw away. I won't crawl on my knees for you. I won't believe the lies that hide the truth. I won't sweat one more drop for you. 'Cuz we are the rust upon your gears. We are the insects in your ears. We crawl. We crawl. We crawl... all over you. We sow the seeds to see us through. Our days are precious and so few. We all reap what we are due. A judge's sky no longer blue. We bring the dawn all over new. We crawl. We crawl. We crawl... all over you
ready to fall,Hold on slow down let's hear from the top now. and tell me everything. I know Ive been gone for what seems like forever. But I'm here now waiting. To convince you that I'm not a ghost or a stranger. But closer than you think. She said just go on she wants you. And same does your life by. Please don't die on me. Wings wont take me. Eyes closed face me. So take a step. But don't look down. take a step. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall. (ready to fall). I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall. Perpetual motion the image wont focus. A blur is all that's in. But here in this moment like the eye of the storm. It all came clear to me. I found a shelter to lean on. And I thought of a reason to live all by itself. I took one last look from the heights that. I once loved. And then I ran like hell. Wings won't take me. Eyes closed face me. So take a step. But don't look down. take a step. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall. (ready to fall). I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall. I count the times that Ive been sorry. (I know I know). Now my conventions slowly drowns. (I know I know). If there's a time these walls could guard you. (I know I know). Then let that time be right now. I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall). I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall). I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall). I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong. I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall [x5]
reception fades,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). You talk about, the way things were. but I can't hear what you're saying. A time when life was not this hard. blessed by the innocence. Is the best yet, to come?. Or did it pass by long ago?. Are we holding on, to a thread. Of something already dead?. I'm not your reason to stand up straight. Shoulders back chest out and eyes raised. Stepping back, I hesitate. I can't let myself be taken. Is the best yet, to come?. Or did it pass by long ago?. Are we holding on, to a thread. Of something already dead?. You can't change your mind,. Expect me to care. You can't just snap your fingers and expect me to be there.. You can't change your mind,. Expect me to care. You can't just snap your fingers and expect me to be there.. Can't just change your mind!. The reception fades the signals breaking up. And am I moving on or am I giving up?. If you walk away from this with anything. Live your life today!"
remains of summer memories,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). All these days!. I'll forever cherish. In the confines of my heart. The faces of ten years ago. Like fingerprints on my heart.

On her hands and knees she crawls. How can I breathe. When fear chokes my every breath?. How many of your lies. Will I be fed?(Hey!). The remains of summer memories. spent so far away...(Hey!). Free from the fear or jealousy. that plagues our lives today(Hey!). Now that promises we're broken. enemies were made(Hey!). We spend our precious time pointing fingers. trying to place the blame. The remains, of what's left. Of our past. Of a future yet to come. Of the battles that we've lost. And the fights that we have won"

sudden life,"Floating in the clouds, giving up the fight. A voice is calling out. I'm walking into the light. We used to race a thousand miles a day so fast. Feet that barely even touched the ground. We used to fly to places out beyond our own little world. The fury and the sunlight. A sun flickered, like a television set. Bright flashes of a warning sign. Vapid shadows in a world gone static. We're rolling away line by the fading line. Under water for years we were fine. Till we started to swim, then drown. The current takes us. Now we're walking into the light.

Woke up falling on a wave of golden sound. Tunnel vision and a great beyond. Heart beating like a rhythm slowing down. Now it's gone, I let go of a soul. A flat line and I'm closing down. Whisper a warm farewell, the flames all beckon me. As we're walking into the light. Are you dying all your life?. Broken, beaten, tired of. You wanted to learn but don't know how. Diagnosis: Sudden life!. Can no one revive me now?. Feels like I'm walking into the light. Don't suppose that you know the way. Don't suppose that your care. I see lights up ahead. And hear cries of angels ringing in my ears. But you know that, had you a choice. You would go back and do it again. We all have unfinished business to tend. So, no I won't go gentle. Into the light; good night. You can keep your candle. I'm walking away from the light. Yeah, I'm walking away from the light. I'm walking away from the light. I'm walking away from the light. I'm walking away from the light. Diagnosis: Sudden life!. I woke up my heart racing, I'm. At a loss explaining why. Are you dying all your life?. Now put your darkest days behind.

the approaching curve,"""The Approaching Curve"". [Spoken:]. The music played with a common frequency.. The speakers gently seeped the sound of ambient keyboards and light percussion,. creating a seductive soundtrack to our midnight drive through curtains of blackness.. The windows were cold to the touch, reflecting the icy conditions in our immediate extremity.. Salt stains and fingerprints littered the glass, and streets with melted snow cascaded down it's length.. The music pulsed louder, yet gentle, like the far away squeal of a pot of boiling water.. The skylight was glowing faintly with a vague hints of an impending dawn.. The car raced along a painfully straight stretch of road,. and she hadn't so much as turned the steering wheel two degrees in the past twenty minutes,. or hardly spoken.. As we were, so perfect, so happy.. I'll remember, only our smiles because that's all they've seen.. Long since dried, when we are found, are the tears in which we had drowned.. As we were, so perfect, so happy.. [Spoken:]. ""Why are you doing this?"" she spoke without expecting a response.. Her voice penetrated the still air of our speechless drive, so silent my heart had jumped.. ""I'm not doing anything,"" I said, but I didn't even believe that myself.. ""This is what's best, for me, for you, for us, or maybe just for me,"" I thought,. as a tear formed in the pit of her eye. The music poured through the speakers. and we were losing ourselves in the cadence. She looked down momentarily and closed her eyes. for a bit longer than a standard blink. Then she was crying. Then she was shouting.. Then I was shouting, now pouring confessions, having no answers, or solutions,. and we barely could even hear the questions.. As we were, so perfect, so happy.. I'll remember, only our smiles because that's all they've seen.. Long since dried, when we are found, are the tears in which we had drowned.. As we were, so perfect, so happy.. Don't put me underground, I was meant for a life somewhere else.. Please Love give me the wheel, please for both of our hearts you.. We'll steal tonight. (We'll steal tonight.). As we were, so perfect, so happy.. Don't remember, only your smiles because that's all they've seen.. Long since dried, when we are found, are the tears in which we had drowned.. As we were, so perfect, so happy.. [Spoken:]. Our cracking voices became part of the music.. The car pressed on faster through he night. As our voices lowered,. the cadence again overtook the air.. Up ahead there was a curve approaching.. She made no indications of slowing."
the black market,A currency of heartache and sorrow. The air we breathe is stale with mold. To shadows we are slaves. Digging deeper everyday. But emptiness is growing so old. Headlamps light the tunnels we wander. They shimmer and they dance on the walls. We're lost inside these caves. As the chances of escape. Grow slimmer til there's no chance at all. This ink it travels from the page. Up my hand into my veins. Choking on the stories I've told. If there are words here left to say. I just wanna let you know. I'm falling on my knees right now. I'm covered in the mess I made. These colors used to wash right out. But now they are a part of me. I've been searching for a remedy. When all along it's been in front of me. I need you here. I need you now. Right now. We traffic in the blackest of markets. Trade misery like diamonds and gold. The angst that we exchange. For applause and petty praise. Is finally now taking its toll. But there's a world above the ground. A life that we can lead. We're washing off the dirt from our clothes. I don't wanna live without. No I just wanna let you know. I'm falling on my knees right now. I'm covered in the mess I made. These colors used to wash right out. But now they are a part of me. I've been searching for a remedy. When all along its been in front of me. I need you here. I need you now. Right now. Black stains. They mark me like a letter. Don't fade. Cracking under the pressure. Black stains. Nothing stays gold. There's a world above the ground. A life that we can lead. But we're lost deep down in these holes. And I have seen the way out. Now I just wanna let you know. I'm falling on my knees right now. I'm covered in the mess I made. These colors used to wash right out. But now they are a part of me. I've been searching for a remedy. When all along it's been in front of me. Your voice it washed the stains away

the ghost of tom joad,"Man walks along the railroad track. And he's going some place, there's no going back. The highway patrol chopper coming up over the ridge. Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge. The shelter line stretching around the corner. Welcome to the new world order. Families sleeping in their cars in the southwest. No home, no job, no peace, no rest. And the highway is alive tonight. Nobody's fooling nobody is to where it goes. I'm sitting down here in the campfire light. Searching for the ghost of tom joad. He pulls his prayer book out of a sleeping bag. The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag. He's waiting for the time. When the last shall be first and the first shall be last. In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass. He's gotta one way ticket to the promised land. He's gotta hole in your belly and a gun in your hand. Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock. Bathing in the cities' aqueducts. And the highway is alive tonight. Nobody's fooling nobody is to where it goes. I'm sitting down here in the campfire light. With the ghost of old tom joad. Now tom said; ""ma, whenever ya see a cop beating a guy. Wherever a hungry new born baby cries. Wherever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air. Look for me ma' I'll be there. Wherever somebody is looking for a place to stand. For a decent job or a helping hand. Wherever somebody is struggling to be free. Look in their eyes ma, you'll see me! "".

the good left undone,"In fields where nothing grew but weeds,. I found a flower at my feet,. Bending there in my direction,. I wrapped a hand around its stem,. I pulled until the roots gave in,. Finding now what I been missing,. But I know.... So I tell myself, tell myself it's wrong. There's a point we pass from which we can't return. I felt the cold rain of the coming storm. All because of you. I haven't slept in so long. When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean. Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down. I'll follow your voice. All you have to do is shout it out.. Inside my hands these petal brown. Dried up falling to the ground. But it was already to late now. I pushed my fingers through the earth. Return this flower to the dirt. So it can live. I walked away now. But I know.... Not a day goes by that I don't feel it's spurn. There's a point we pass from which we can't return. I felt the cold rain of the coming storm. All because you I haven't slept in so long. When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean. Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down. I'll follow your voice. All you have to do is shout it out.. All because of you. All because of you. All because of you. I haven't slept in so long. When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean. Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down. Inside these eyes of yours. All because of you. I believe in angels.. Not the kind with wings. No, not the kind with halos.. The kind that brings you home. When home becomes a strange place. I'll follow your voice. All you have to do is shout it out."
the great die-off,"Theres a fire on the borders. And it's burning down the walls you built high. And there's a steady stream of anger. And it's spilling from the coasts. A tidal wave.

With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours. Oh oh!. We want it all and we want it now. Time has come in to drown you out. We make ourselves at home while your body's at war. Oh oh!. Go!. Traditions tears at us and rituals. And we are all just clocks on wrong times. Something triggers each and every time I hear you say. ""God bless this place! "". But your numbers have turned to me now. Though in danger we'll still hunt you down. With hands on the stake. Long may you rain. We want it all and we want it now. Tonight I'll watch your fires burn on. With these guns in hand we pry these guns from yours. Oh oh!. We want it all and we want it now. Time has come in to drown you out. We make ourselves at home while your body's at war. Ooh yeah!. And theres a fire on the borders. And it's burning down the walls you built high. And there's a steady stream of anger. And it's spilling from the coasts. A tidal wave. We want the motherfucking world. And we want it now. Tonight I'll watch your fires burn out. With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours. Oh yeah!. No, I don't wanna wait. I know I better way. So step aside and come on. Better yet just go away. Our change has finally come. There might be another one now. No, we're not gonna wait. We want it now. Yeah, we're dust in the flames. We want it now!"
the strength to go on,"Welcome home. While away. They have tampered with the locks. And your things they rearranged. ""We propose a better way."". Said they nothing left behind. In their wake of disarray. You fell in place. Don't fall asleep. They'll find us here. I know a place to disappear. As a voice proclaimed. What we are is the sum of 1000 lies. What we know is almost nothing at all. But we are what we are until the day we die. Or until we don't have the strength to go on. Let us cry. Let us be. Let us open up our hearts. Without fear of anything. Faith alone. Is all we need. To traverse this burning bridge. Now before it gets too late. You said. ""it's fine"". But the heart reveals. What smiles betray. Your sad sad eyes gave you away. Don't you know. What we are is the sum of 1000 lies. What we know is almost nothing at all. But we are what we are until the day we die. Or until we don't have the strength to go on. Our shoulders bear an awful weight. But still we trudge on just the same. Our colors run then leave a stain. They blacken our once honest name. But how can we argue you, tell me. Over the fury and the fire. How many times can we tell you that we. Are not like you, we see right through. Your poor disguise that fails to fool. The wary eye that is trained on you. What we are is the sum of 1000 lies. What we know is almost nothing at all. But we are what we are until the day we die. Or until we don't have the strength to go on"
the violence,"Dancing on the crumbling precipice. The rocks are coming loose just at the end. Are we laughing? Are we crying?. Are we drowning? Are we dead?. Or is it all a dream?. The bombs are getting closer everyday. 'That can never happen here' we used to say. Have these wars come to our doorstep?. Has this moment finally come?. Or is it all a dream?. Are we not good enough?. Are we not brave enough?. Is the violence in our nature. just the image of our maker?. Are we not good enough?. Are we not brave enough?. To become something greater. Than the violence in our nature?. Are we not good, good enough?. Or is it all a dream?. To a predetermined fate are we condemned. Or maybe we're a book without an end. We're not stories, we're not actors. We're awake and in control. And this is not a dream. So can we break this mold. And set in motion something new. Forgetting what we know. An evolution overdue. Fight the current. Pull the ripcord. Get away!. Are we not good enough?. Are we not brave enough?. Is the violence in our nature. just the image of our maker?. Are we not good enough?. Are we not brave enough?. To become something greater. Than the violence in our nature?. Are we not good, good enough?. Well trodden paths. Are all we take. We need a storm. Let's pray for rain now. To wash these roads away. Let's get off track and wander far. Same roads lead to same destinations. Follow nothing but your heart. We're talking in our sleep. And sleeping through our lives. We dream of the places. Where we never die. We step from the shadows. And into the light. Are we not good enough?. Are we not brave enough?. Is the violence in our nature. just the image of our maker?. Are we not good enough?. Are we not brave enough?. To become something greater. Than the violence in our nature?. Are we not good enough?. Are we not brave enough?. Are we not good, good enough?. Or was it all a dream?"
this is letting go,"Once upon a time I could take anything, anything.. Always stepped in time, regardless of the beat. I moved my feet, I carried weight. When I could not do a thing. And I'm done seeking treasure. Just to wake up in an early grave. So I stopped right there and said. Go all alone, 'cause I won't follow.. This isn't giving up, no this is letting go. Out with the old dreams I've borrowed. The path I call from here on out will be my own. The path will be my own. This is the part where the needle skips. And the chorus plays like a sick that drips. A syllable repeating, like a warning we're not heeding. Until all is said and we noticed it. When the wheels brace and the tires grip. A map we've been misreading. A defeat we're not conceding. Until now. There must be some other way out. Go all alone, 'cause I won't follow. This isn't giving up no this is letting go. Out with the old dreams I've borrowed. The path I call from here on out will be my own. A path to take me home. [Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!]. The wind died. The whole world ceased to move. Now so quiet. Her beating heart became a boom. We locked eyes. For just a moment or two. She asked why. I said ""I don't know why"". I just know. The wind died. The whole world ceased to move. Now so quiet. Her beating heart became a boom. We locked eyes. For just a moment or two. She asked why. I said ""I don't know why"". I just know. I just know. Go all alone, 'cause I won't follow. This isn't giving up, no this is letting go. I'll make the most of all this sorrow. I tried to break these tears' contempt but now I'm through. I'm letting go of you.. This is letting go. This is letting go. Once upon a time I could take anything, anything."
tip the scales,"Are we so alone,. So distant,. So forgotten,. As we think ourselves to be?. These are our lives. But did they ever even matter?. Are we worth remembering?. These machines feed on the tears of broken lives and dying dreams. We’re throwing wrenches in the gears. Our lives will not be lived in vain. When this is all said and done. We spent this life on the run. Judged by the company we keep. Our language, buried inside. These lungs that keep us alive. We breathe so selfishly. Promises we plan to break. Are made in whispered voices. Cause our despair knows many names. We make mistakes. But we apologize with roses we never stop to smell along the way. These machines feed on the tears of broken lives and dying dreams. We’re throwing wrenches in the gears. Our lives will not be lived in vain. We fell from the sky today. We melt into balls of clay. We sell ourselves everyday. Don’t tell me how to live this way. Pushed so far to the edge. We teeter just on the brink. You can lead me to the bloodbath. But you can’t make me drink. As these machines feed on the tears of broken lives and dying dreams. We’re throwing wrenches in the gears. Our lives will not be lived in vain. Our lives will not be lived in vain"
to the core,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). If I could paint how I feel,. I'd draw bullseye on your forehead. my anger is not misdirected. unless it somehow misses you!. Time spent on hate, is time gone to waste,. I watch you point and click your life away!. So cast the stones that I'll gladly catch. and I'll throw them right back,. I stand behind the things I say,. you type the words you won't say to my face!. Time spent on hate, is time gone to waste,. I watch you point and click your life away.... It seems you've let me go again, (The Core). Just like the day you let me in, (The Core). The best of intentions,. You were never mine to begin,. Begin with.... So step away from the fucking screen,. See a world outside your scene,. Maybe then you will know. And realize the lack of threat you pose"
to them these streets belong,"so look in my eyes, what will you leave behind once you've gone? (so precious). you got what you came for now I think its time to move on (when will you say). but these ghosts come alive like water and wine. walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs,. to them these streets belong. my atonement lasts the best part of eternity (eternity). ran out of hands to count the sin that breeds inside of me (inside of me). not this hate but the loneliness has left me here into this mess of. my hands are soaking in the blood of angels. on broken wings they collapse (will I see the break of day). dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell. all these lost halos wash away. head hung from shame we bear a weight that brings me to a crawl (to a crawl). these years of longing tell of decades of unanswered calls (unanswered calls). for a change, cuz everyday we slip and fall. kicked while were down, our fists clenched into a ball. my hands are soaking in the blood of angels. on broken wings they collapse (will I see the break of day). dark clouds exploded and torents of rain fell. all these lost halos wash away. so look in my eyes, what will you leave behind once you've gone? (so precious). you got what you came for now i think its time to move on (when will you say). but these ghosts come alive like water and wine. walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs. to them these streets belong"
torches,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). On clearer days. I can see the lights from my bedroom door,. On windy nights. I can smell the lake as it drifts to me from the shore. The traffic lights silently change a thousand times a day. But I'm still waiting, yeah.. I'm still waiting. If my hand could block the sun!. Would we ever wake up?. If I turned back all these clocks!. Would that be time enough?. I can't remember exactly when. this longing began. But I know it wasn't before. the day you touched my hand,. Laugh and shout in blissful daze and numbers are exchanged,. I'm still waiting, yeah.. I'm still waiting. If my hand could block the sun!. Would we ever wake up?. If I turned back all these clocks!. Would that be time enough?. So put your hands where I can see them,. And shut your mouth, I know who you are,. In a world void of feeling or heart. I know that we are the torches in the dark. Let's break this down,. Let's make this count,. Let's leave this one-horse town,. No better time than now. [repeat x2]. The angels dance like feathers float,. they're here to see and to be seen,. the clock strikes two,. the music slows and each one slowly dons their wings,. once outside they all pair off and hand in hand they leave. but I'm still waiting, yeah.. I'm still waiting. If my hand could block the sun!. Would we ever wake up?. If I turned back all these clocks!. Would that be time enough?"
tragedy + time,"On the edges of the sharpest knives. In the middle of the darkest nights. Always knew that I would find you here. In a puddle of the bravest tears. I've seen enough to know it's lonely where you are. Above the crowd feet dangling from a rooftop. She waits from ledges for a voice to talk her down. Nothing matters but the pain when you're alone. The never ending nights when you're awake. When you're praying that tomorrow its okay. There will be a time to crack another smile. Maybe not today or for awhile. But were holding on to laugh again someday. To laugh again someday. All that matters is the time we had. Doesn't matter how it all went bad. Never wonder what it might be like. Shut the door say goodbye. When faced with tragedy. We come alive or come undone. So don't look back, let it shape you like an ocean. Even the deepest scars in time will fade. Nothing matters but the pain when you're alone. The never-ending nights when you're awake. When you're praying that tomorrow its okay. There will be a time to crack another smile. Maybe not today or for awhile. But were holding on to laugh again someday. Now were holding on to laugh again someday. And sometimes you have to go back. To know just where you have been. But were old enough to know that. What has been will be again, and again. And the bravest of faces are the ones where we fake it. And the roles that we play. Nothing matters when the pain is all but gone. When you are finally awake. Despite the overwhelming odds tomorrow came. And when they see you crack a smile. And you decide to stay awhile. You'll be ready then to laugh again. Nothing matters but the pain. (We are tragedy, yeah we are sympathy). Nothing matters but the pain. And you see what you want to see. Nothing matter but the pain. (We are misery, a distant memory). Nothing matters but the pain. But we all learn to laugh again. Yeah we all learn to laugh again. Oh we all learn to laugh again"
under the knife,"Wake me up inside. Tell me there's a reason. To take another step. To get up off my knees and,. Follow this path of most resistance. How ever it takes us,. Whatever it faces and wherever it leads. So wake me when it's through. I don't want to feel the things that you do. Don't worry I'll be fine. I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside. Something for the pain, just to kill this feeling. Although we look awake, inside were all still sleeping. I'll spent my time here alive but buried there. Do you believe we will ever make it?. Do you think we will ever really say?. So wake me when it's through. I don't want to feel the things that you do. Don't worry I'll be fine. I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside. Wake me up inside. These dreams will die if we let them. Wake me up inside. Today won't start if we just give in. (Cause you'll be anything). Just wake me when it's through. I don't want to feel the things that you do. Don't worry I'll be fine. I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside"
unraveling,"And all these things that we tie together. Keep unraveling apart. And the light that used to burn so bright. Now is dark. With anger-laced intent we set fire. To the bridges that remain. And they're wading thru the current now.... And they. Drown in the flood of the tears. That have been wept. And i scream to the sky. No, you are not alone.... If you think that you're words will ever make a. difference. Think again and carry on. Because the weight behind the hand that holds us is. strong. But there is hope in the roar of a thousand pleading. cries. And all these things that we tie together. The sound of their tongues being bitten. Is all I hear. As we fire at the whites of theirs eyes then. Dance on ashes of the world.... As they drown in the flood of the tears. That have been wept. And their tongues being bitten. Is all that I can hear. As I scream to the sky,. I need you now.... Can you feel this truth now unraveling?. or will you chase the burning sun. into the sea."
voice of dissent,"Here along we wander and we roam. We cut our teeth in city streets and gutters we call home. Await the day the clouds will part. Deliver words we know by heart. Raise your fucking voice. Or be a face in the crowd. Isn't that what it's all about?. So tempt me not with the life you have bought. Our keep is earned in the change that we sought. Explain away the tangled truth. Accuse away but without proof. Raise your fucking voice. Or be a face in the crowd. Isn't that what it's all about?. Boots on the ground, aim tried and true. Bells toll the sound; impending doom. In our respite our numbers grew. Now it's time to. Raise your fucking voice. Or be a face in the crowd. Isn't that what it's all about?. Is that what this is about?. byLéoPS"
voices off camera,"Can you hear. the desperate cries that are calling out your name?. twisting your arms,holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve,. do you feel this underlying sense of urgency or are you as blind as me?. I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight,. I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere now. I can't bear the thought of losing,. I dread the attention winning brings. and ever since the day I came. I can stand without your strings. I'm so sick of all these people. but I'm scared to be alone. and if this life has taught me anything. I forgot it long ago and so I. (Refrão 2x). I hit the ground and I'm still running. but I need a place to stay tonight,. I swear I'll be gone in the morning. I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes. The heart is something, you can't control. We either choose to follow, or be left on our own. So we're leaving here on, a less-travelled road. As desperate cries grow louder,. I know we're getting close. Getting close.... -Refrão-"
wait for me,"Do you see the world in different colors?. Do you see the world in black and gray?. Alone in your thoughts. How many others have stood where you stand. Where you stand today?. I've stood where you stand. But all, can you. Wait for me now?. Take off this crown. To break all that defiles. Don't you know?. Wait for me now. The end's robbed me now. Wait for me, wait for me. Wait for me, wait for me now. The promise of safe return undelivered. The ocean is wider than I first guessed. When roads disappeared, I followed the rivers. But somehow got in over my head. So deep I felt taken. Wait for me now?. Take off this crown. To break all that defiles. Don't you know?. Wait for me now. The end's robbed me now. Wait for me, wait for me. Wait for me, wait for me now. A lost dream of what could have been. A house on fire, a tangled web. The key turns to find the locks have changed. In time to hear the back door slam. A sound that to this day I can't forget. The colors drained to black and gray. Oh!. Wait for me now?. Take off this crown. To break all that defiles. Don't you know?. Wait for me now. The end's robbed me now. Wait for me, wait for me. Wait for me, wait for me now"
weight of time,"(Lyric by Rodrigo Takahashi). Speak with hesitation, talk with reservation. blood on your hands, dried long since. but guilt still glowing in your eyes.... You hide behind.

Stack the mistakes you've made. on top of the lies. to hide them. your excuses just don't add up. empty handed we all wonder. Why.... You hide behind. (and now this blood has long since dried). Your perfect crime. (guilt still glowing in your eyes). Never ask why you try. Now I know that. Your words. Your actions. Intentions. All were lies. Your heart grows heavier with time. (and now this blood has long since dried!). Have I said enough. Have I said too much. Is it your responsibility to decide. You're heart grows heavier with time. (I will decide!).

welcome to the breakdown,"All hail, the jester has landed. Defile the country he sings. Charmed like a snake in a basket. Should be coiled up and ready to spring. We're raising our cross just to burn it. The clergy are selling their souls. Clearing a path. Ignoring the facts. Intoxicated by the throne. We'll be standing here holding our ground. come what may. Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave. Welcome to the breakdown. Welcome to the end of the road. Welcome to the breakdown. We've got nowhere else to go. Will we all go deaf in the chamber of echoes. Cheering the missile parade. Agreeing to let all the banks rob the people. Together we circle the drain.

We've got nowhere else to go. Welcome to the breakdown. Welcome to the end of the road. This is a breakdown. And we've got nowhere else to go. It's a game you've been playing. It's a fragile machine. It's a pied-piper song. That has lulled you to sleep. It's a lie and you fell for it. Hook line and sinker. A hand that you shook. That then gave you the finger. A fraud and a fake. A cowardly king. That lied to your face. But you still kiss the ring. This is the breakdown!. This is the breakdown!. This is the breakdown!. Im standing here holding our ground. Come what may. Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave. Welcome to the breakdown. Welcome to the end of the road. This is a breakdown. We've got nowhere else to go. Welcome to the breakdown.

whereabouts unknown,"To the ends of this lost world. You have marched and you have sworn. to a tainted crown of thorns. As the hungry sails unfurl. We are thrusted from the shore.

wolves,"Light up the torches. And wake up the King. The smoke you've ignored. Is a flame you can't contain. We circle the walls. And claw at the dirt. We growl from our guts. And howl until it hurts.

zero visibility,"Settling in here for the long haul. Can't hide forever's what they say. In like the wind. Out with a bang. Meanwhile nothing has changed. With each word slowly uttered. A storm brews in her eyes. A missed shot at the buzzer. Time whether wasted. Or well-spent is still time. We are not brave we are not wise. We stand at the end of the longest lines. But we stand here all together. We have been damned. But we have survived. We came back to homes we don't recognize. But we returned here all together. Moments of clarity here are short-lived. Bled through the bandages again. When is a lie. No longer white. But black as a day without sun. Passed out in gutter. Woke up in your arms. Nursed back and recovered. The same touch that heals me. Left a scar. We are not brave we are not wise. We stand at the end of the longest lines. But we stand here all together. We have been damned. But we have survived. We came back to homes we don't recognize. But we returned here all together. And the world works in ways that I never. Have claimed to know. We got out in front of the weather. But it followed. And view from here isn't better. But it's all we know. It's all we know. We are not brave we are not wise. We stand at the edge of the border lines. But we stand here all together. We have been damned. But we have survived. And who we've become you won't recognize. But we became them, all together"
