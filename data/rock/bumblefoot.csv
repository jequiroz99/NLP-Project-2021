drunk,"You're a pain in my ass. You make me wanna die. Or kill or try to forget the remains of my life. I feel so hostile when you're around. Stumbling in the dark, through the trailer park. While the sky's falling down. I see your face in every drop of golden urine. Reflections rippling in the bowl, the room is spinning. I fall to my knees, oh God, please, I'm losing everything. Retasting nachos, exhaling beer, I love getting drunk. I faked a back injury to stay unemployed. But now the nagging pain is real. And we're both in the void. It's time for dinner, while the dog food's still cold. I'm watching the game, words grow loud and profane. I storm out the door. I used to love you many years ago. But my blood content changed. Those days so far away, and so many to go. Defacing my clothes with belly stain. And smelling like a skunk. Replacing myself in public places. I love getting..."
i hate me more than i love you,"(Girl, you've been treatin' me so bad - and I think I like it). (Girl, I don't think you understand, so I'm gonna tell ya how it is). You can do anything ya want with me - You can lie and I'll believe. You can tell me stay and I'll be waiting. To be the one who wants to hold your hand - To be your foolish man. And when ya do me wrong I'll say I'm sorry. Someday when ya want me and ya lose the man ya left behind. I say it in my mind but never say it out loud. We both know deep down I'll be the one who's still around. It's breaking all my spirit down and lifting you so high. It's a cruel cruel world. And I've got a girl that shows me it's true. In a world so unkind,. I've got to ask why I'd want to stay with you. Cause I hate me more than I love you. GUEST LYRICIST - ANOMOS:. Self esteem lower than snow at 12 below - Aint never seen nice, so bad is all I know. It's hard to look up when all I feel is down - Explain my pains through instruments with sound. All these years of searchin for the right answers - That you never helped me come closer to. Was it my fault bein' a naive romancer - I took it how it came - I should have been a chancer. Now I open my eyes and see that you're controllin' all of me. It's time to make a choice - but what should I do - When I hate me more than I love you. It's a cruel cruel world. And I've got a girl that shows me it's true. In a world so unkind,. Please don't ask me why - I just might tell the truth. I hate me more than I love you. Ya never showed me any love before. Just a game and ya played me like a cheap hand. The more ya treat me like an open door. The more I like it and keep on crawlin' back again. Draggin me and my dignity across the floor to ya now,. So you can kick me when I'm down. Oh, use me and abuse me - you're never gonna lose me. I can't let go of anything. Punish me, won't ya punish me - I don't deserve all the better things. Punish me, won't ya punish me - I can't forgive an imperfect me. It's a cruel cruel world. And I've got a girl that shows me it's true. In a world so unkind,. I made up my mind - I've got to tell you the truth. I hate me more than I love you. I hate me more than I love you. (Ah ,yeah - there ya have it baby - all for you).

a way out,"Why do I try - sometimes I need reasons. For leaving songs after I stop breathing. Long after I'm gone - what greater gift will be there. If I struggle, if I dig deep, go every night without sleep. Torturin' myself till I give every piece away and there's nothing left.. Till I don't wanna talk, I don't wanna fuck. I just wanna shoot up into space where I can blow up. Into pieces that float into nowhere - I wanna go there. Where I won't know care, where I won't know existence. Resistance, for an instance, for a moment. We can fight but every moment will always be lost.. I can't believe what you're sayin' now. Nothing is real except for pain now. Life is a deal I never made now. Tossed into skin - I need a way out. I had to blow my brains out. No matter how we spend our time. Every tick of the clock counting down. We lose our minds trying to find a way. To make it all stop - climbing for years. Out of fear that we won't reach the top. My hands are numb and I need to just drop. I can't believe what you're sayin' now. Nothing is real except for pain now. Life is a deal I never made now. Tossed into skin - I need a way out. I had to blow my brains out. I need a way out"
apathy,Apathy and afterbirth. Wasted seeds growing in the dirt. Could it be our paths always weave. I believe in mortality. But I don't care. I don't care at all. I don't care no more. In the air apples leave the tree. In the garden snakes are scheming. Misery and the merciful. Company for the gullible. I don't care at all. I don't care no more. I'm just wastin' time. Got you on my mind.... Empathy for the cynical. Apathy and I don't care. Seeds are sewing behind every glare. Cruel roots anchor into the Earth. Afterbirth never leaves the dirt. I don't care at all. I don't care no more. I'm just wastin' time. Got you on my mind...
argentina,"This is our last goodbye. Young hearts will stop, torn souls set free. All that we have is now. If this is what you want then come to me. My argentina, my love. One final kiss 'til we meet again. Now I know what it's like. To live two lives and have to choose. Sorrow and song, they dance. Let them, for all the perfect nights with you. My argentina, my love. One final kiss 'til we meet again. I never asked for your love. You gave it all and now it's gone, oh, it's gone. I can't be obligated. I never said I was the one, one, the one. This is the winter of our lives. We come to play the final scene. The curtains close and in the darkness we expose. What lies beneath. You thought I needed someone. To be complete but you were wrong, oh, so wrong. I'm nothing more than who I am. Don't put it all in my hands. I never said that I could save you from yourself. But you took the chance. And this is how it ends. Games of revenge that no one wins. This is how it ends. We romanticize our pain. And justify our rage. We excuse ourselves and remove ourselves. From all the wars we wage. We call it love. Competition, foolish pride, taking sides. We call it love. Stabbing words manipulate. It's how we're taught to use and take. We call it love. When you look back on what you had, not what you lost. Then call it love. But this is how it ends. All things must come to an end. And in our place once we're forgotten. A new day will come. And the sun will shine again. But I don't know when"
awake,I miss me.. Miss the noise. Miss the colored dreams. And rings.. And screams. Miss the pain of love and tragedy. It's time to decide.. How should I live each tomorrow - like the first day or the last. With silence in the sunshine or music in the darkness. Either way I'll be ok as long as when I get there I'm with you. You make me wanna live again. But what is life without knowing who I am. It's time to decide.. How should I live each tomorrow - like the first day or the last. With silence in the sunshine or music in the darkness. This peace inside is killing me - I think it might be time to leave. Feel the floodgate start to break and crash away the wall. And I awake with you. The first sight in these eyes I want is you
backfur,The hair on my belly is touching my chest - the hair on my chest is touching my shoulders. It looks like I'm wearing a permanent sweater - I'm working my way toward backfur. The hair on my ass is rising up - the hair on my head is falling down. I got a spider mole that's spreading her legs - she's laying her eggs in backfur. I had a smooth body 'long time ago - then gravity gave me a few folds. Somebody shot me with a beast gun square on - the pellets were seeds of backfur. My body's 'lot wider than it used to be - too much a taste of the old country. Inherited my simian ancestry - I'm working my way toward backfur. I used to think I was invincible (10 years ago). So many things I didn't know. I never knew how cruel the world can be (silly me). My time was not complete. Poor me (poor me) I'm dying. I pushed my mind to a future height - and balanced with a pre-historic body type. Just give me my speedos and put me on a beach - I'm sporting my rolls of backfur. I keep a short comb on a stick - to pick out the occasional deer ticks. I can't afford electrolysis - face down I'm a rug of backfur. I'm pushing harder but I'm losing speed (moving so slow). So many miles left to go. I knew but couldn't feel mortality (silly me). My time was not complete. Poor me (poor me) I'm dying. I used to be a fatty fatback - an inch away from my heart-attack. I'm pushing my luck I'm chasing hot dog trucks - I'm shaded from the sun with backfur. I'm hosting a family of mosquitoes - they live beneath the thicket of Velcro. They can't find my cholesterol-high-blood-rich skin - they can't find their way out of my backfur. I didn't know my life was on the clock. Won't close my eyes anymore. A new year passes every time I blink - or so I think. My time was not complete. Poor me - I'm dying
breaking away,Breaking Away. Why do we go so far. Till it's too far to turn back. When we take it so far. We lose so much more. We lose it all. Stop me if I go too far. It's so hard to turn back. Don't let me take it all. Away from you. From you. So don't let go now. Please show me how. To stop this breaking away. From you
brooklyn steakhouse,"My reservation was for 9. All heads look down. There was no clock around. I tried but couldn't make it on time. Couldn't find a lie. Watches stopped, broken clocks.

chair ass,"I've got a chair attached to my ass for 13 hours every day. Add two more after and before, just getting there and away. Like thrown meat landing on a seat - just vegetating in decay. I'm squattified - too settled in, and melting into pear-shaped dismay. Shapes and textures etched into my back on few occasions whence I stand. Impressions of a cushion pressed into a lazy man. The furniture acts like a cookie-cutter - reforming me like wooden hands on flattened dough. Till I tear the glue of hair and sweat and go. The vinyl interlocked with dimples grips my body. Till I'm just a finished pile of human relic on a legged place-mat. I fall between the tensing cracks - I feel trapped on the tracks. I don't need feet - I'm levitated by the seat - yeah, I've got chair ass. Yeah, no, something gone wrong. Here, gone, too late, I'm done. My blood pools in my thighs. I bloat and swell cold till I rise. Numb I stand, arms in clammy palms, rubber bones give at the knee. Ankles thick but empty, couldn't hold the gelatin mold. Watch the cardhouse man fold. Yeah, no, something gone wrong. Here, gone, too late, I'm done. Yeah, no, gone, too late, I'm done. Yeah, no, gone, too late, I'm done"
clots,"And the clots, they never stop. They barricade my veins. And the clots keep building up. They suffocate my brain. I built them to destroy myself. They're circling the prey. I push until I break. I feel them start to scrape. The core of all I am is chiseling away. And every spec of life is gonna rot away in time. We turn to mud or turn to stone, it's the grand design. A maze of petrified hearts and I'm lost inside. We all self-destruct, to love is to deny. And that is life. And the clots, they never stop. They tear beneath my skin. And the clots keep building up. They rip new holes again. You're here to turn me inside out. And then turn me away. For all my life I'd choke. On clouds of savior's smoke. Until my blackened soul was burning away. And every spec of life is gonna rot away in time. We turn to mud or turn to stone, it's the grand design. A maze of petrified hearts and I'm lost inside. We all self-destruct, to love is to deny. And that is life. We build our castles and we stomp them back to dust. Like ants, we climb the hill again. Tell me how many times. Am I supposed to die. Before you lift the cross and let a man rise. And every spec of life is gonna rot away in time. We turn to mud or turn to stone, it's the grand design. A maze of petrified hearts and I'm lost inside. We all self-destruct, to love is to deny. And that is life. We are the clots"

cuturebra,"In the hallway down the staircase. Slowly opening the creaking door. Someone comes along and smiles. And for a moment all is quite the norm. Avoiding all the crowd below the sound of conversations spin. And patiently I wait in every corner for someone to come in. Dry'd in dust on darkened floors. A gasp resists with every buried breath. Watching shadows through the cracks. Of light that shape and sway with every step. So carefully and quietly and with an undetected hand. In comes a breeze it sweeps. The room and follows with a distant slam. Donned in bath kerchief the. Chambermaids unlock and let the daylight in. She spoke of trees, and creeping things. And nestled foundlings in the starlight crib. With an unsaving clench a bribe. Under the cloak is unconcealed. And all her secrets now belong. Forever to whom she revealed. We build on wretched ruins thinly. Veiled below our skin & bones. Cowards, sing each other's rhyme. And add a verse of all your wicked moans. It starts off as a whisper and grows. Into the deepest battle cry. Pressing ears and spying eyes. Await the beast we're nurturing inside. Questions fly and so do I, the hole. Fills with our harshest stones unturned. 'Neath the cardhouse all my kings. Are buried and the queen won't say a word. We plant the tales, they feed on us 'til. Accusations earn their wings. Sold out for sharpened tongues. And spit into the air these creeping things"
delilah,"Lady Delilah - she enslaves me. I'm bound and chained by her lies. One look in her eyes and she breaks me. And I fall down like rain. As the wind sings her name. Oh, Delilah…. I was the strongest man alive. Till you came along - my Delilah. She deceived me but believe me it was alright. To touch her lips was to kiss the blades of her knives. Why do things we know are wrong feel so right?. Worth a lifetime of pain. For one night to sing her name. Oh, Delilah…. I was the strongest man alive. Till you came along - my Delilah. Well I'll never be the same. Cause that girl - yeah, she's to blame. How could I love again. Since she took my heart away.. And then someone said her name. And I tore at my flesh to dull the pain of the sound. And ripped from the chains and the walls came down. And I lay covered and bound. And I called out her name…. I was the strongest man alive. Till you came along - my Delilah"
dirty pant'loons,"You never had a chance. You doodied in your pants. Pant'loons - dirty pant'loons. You did the pee-pee dance. You wet your fancy pants. Pant'loons - dirty pant'loons. I was alive for only five. Shoulda played hookie and stayed at home. Where the toilet was my own. I had to go but I was too shy. Then everything came out that was inside. And in the classroom I did cry. Oh momma come and get me soon. I got a walnut in my pant'loons. CHORUS. ""Take me away"" cried my hidden face. She held me and started down the hall. Stopped by a mop-and-bucketed man. Who with concern wanted to know all. That's when I felt something start to fall. No time for spoken words to be said. As the walnut fell from my pant-leg. He got his answer nodded his head. Can't wait for this day to end. With every moment my humility spread. I'd pay good dollar just to forget. That walnut that fell from my pant-leg. The janitor was from Winnipeg"

don't know who to pray to anymore,"Once upon a time a child. Grew up too fast, went runnin' wild. Now he don't know who to pray to anymore. I once thought God was good and kind. Then mother nature blew my mind. And left my broken body on the floor. Now I don't know who to pray to anymore. But when the world gets real. And I start to feel. The first thing I do. Is turn to you. And then pull away. Until comes the day. Where I just can't live. And learn to forgive. I've got a song that needs to be sung. But I don't know who to play to anymore. We bet away what's in our hand. And then we're told it was the plan. They say all's fair, but someone's keeping score. I've seen it all, I've seen the lies. False promises for compromise. Fought every battle, but still I lost the war. Now I don't know who to pray to anymore. But when the world gets real. And I start to feel. The first thing I do. Is turn to you. And then pull away. Until comes the day. Where I just can't live. And learn to forgive. I know I've changed. Can't find my way. When all is dark. Or is it my heart. That won't come to the light. I'm bad to myself. As a show for you to see. So maybe you'll agree. That you should have been there more for me. Got an old guitar that needs to be strung. But I don't know who to play to anymore. So why should I still believe. When everyone's out to deceive. And all our dreams get washed back on the shore. And fate will prove to be most cruel. Yet hope remains for the helpless fool. Pawns of selfish right & righteous wrong. No I don't know who to pray to anymore. I don't know who to pray to anymore"

every time i shake my head (it's like christmas),EVERYTIME I SHAKE MY HEAD (IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS). Everytime I shake my head. It's like Christmas. Was it coincidence or incidents. That had me wearing white shirts all the time. Every time I shake my head. It's Kris Kringle. And every time I brush my hair. Bells jingle. Itching leads to scratching leads to scalp chunk in my nails. My shampoo fails. My hopes and hairs run down the drain. (what a pain). It's not meant to be Christmas all the time. It's 93 degrees outside. And it's snowing. I'm Mr. Unsure lacking pride. And it's showing. Shaking heads are flaking. Dead skin on my shoulders. All the older shineheads point and giggle at my plight. (and that aint right). It's not meant to be Christmas all the time. Call it HARassed or harASSED. I've been embarrassed in the past. And now at last I've given up on reason. (not on rhyme). It's not meant to be Christmas all the time
fatback,"I had a friend - he had a big behind. And from a mountaintop he tried to fly. Fatback laughed all the time. Lost his step on high climb. Broke his fall with his spine. On the ground Fatback died. He couldn't make it but you know he tried. Poor belly couldn't make it up that slide. CHORUS. Last thing I told him was to watch his step and follow me. And as he dropped he said ""You'll like me better as a memory"". I yelled back down ""A pancake doesn't make very good company"". And then he opened up and spread his butter, syrup, and jelly. And all the multi-legged neighbors came a-runnin'. To see the buffet and they all ended their hungries. And the animals rejoiced and lived happily-ever-after"

I never saw him but I hear he's a bad mutation. Some kinda offspring of a landfill creation. And if the word is true he looks like you all. He cleared the park out - he's alone with your basketball. CHORUS. zp zp dribble drool the ball - no one knows how you can. Slam it on the rim ram it like that jammin' by the wall. You contaminate the park. You quarantine the ball. You can stay until it's dark and take home the ball. CHORUS"
girl like you,"I love you (less). I think of how much we've grown (apart). Of all the things we've gone through (my money). You know how I feel about you (bitch). I need you (gone). Deep in my heart (like an injection of porkfat). All that I have (you take). Is for you (to chew up and spit out like the filthy slut you are). Oh, what have I done. (What did I do). To deserve a girl. Like you, like you. Oh, to deserve a girl. Like you, like you. I tore myself in two. I want you (out). My whole world (sucks). Is about you (getting free lunch). Without you (screwin' thing up). There's nothing (but pleasure). For me (you swine). Oh, what have I done. (What did I do). To deserve a girl. Like you, like you. Oh, to deserve a girl. Like you, like you. I tore myself in two. I love you (bitch). More than you'll ever know (bitch). I wish I could show you (bitch). How much you mean to me (B-B-B-Bumblefoot). Oh, what have I done. (What did I do). To deserve a girl. Like you, like you. Oh, to deserve a girl. Like you, like you. I tore myself in two. (oh, baby… you know… ya know…. ya know I just can't live without you…. I LOVE YOU!!! I'll kill you…). Like a dream come true (a nightmare). It's all about you (Satan)"
go,"GO - time to take action. Put your hands up, we're taking over. Not out to control ya - grow with ya flow with ya hit home with ya. So the truth be told with ya. Stuck in the cracks of the foundations of greed. They said Yeah we care, but they're no longer there. While those who need slowly bleed. This is how we do our share -we GO. Take em out - we step in - one word is where it begins (GO). G for the greed that O oppresses - now we got D to drive the masses. While they wrap themselves in red tape with steady hands. We'll step over them on my command. So if ya hearin' me do like I do and move when I say…. Go - it's about now. Go - let it out now. Go - take em out now. Go - everybody now. Go - step it up now. Go - tear it up now. Go - don't let up now. Go - everybody now. Go - take it all and. Go - shake em all up. Go - wake the fuck up. Go - everybody up. Go - make a big sound. Go - spread it around. Go - tear it all down. Go - everybody now. Go. If I'm just one man what can I do. I can lead the way or follow you. But I won't stand still - we're out of time. And if I die before I give, no one can show I ever lived. So if ya hearin' me do like I do and move when I say GO"
gray,GRAY. I never thought that I would belong. And I would get along with me. I heard the things you said. Filled my empty head - drank my cup of tea. Nothing is OK. All things turn to gray. The sun is low and so am I. It took with it the seeing light. And nothing seems to be OK. When all things turn to gray. I find that pure is the mind. But spoken words can lie once they've gone astray. When I'm here I can't think or feel - nothing here is real. Can't find the words when there's nothing left to say. Nothing is OK. All things turn to gray. The sun is low and so am I. It took with it the seeing light. And nothing seems to be OK. When senses dull me into gray. My time is gone - my time is done. I missed my chance - I miss the sun. I'm standing in a room of one. I'm waiting for the light to come. And nothing seems to be OK. When all things turn to gray. Nothing is OK
hands,"Hands untied speak my mind. I had so much to say. For longest time the words weren't mine. I died an empty slave. I lost my sense of touch (I lost my sense of me). And I was drunk with puke (shrunk every time I breathed). My hands told wasted time (my time was not complete). I killed time swatting flies (while roaming landfill stink). I lost my sense of sight (cause through my hands I see). And what I knew wasn't true (the dummy wasn't me). I took my coat of pins (and turned it inside out). I rid my bones of skin (and rid myself of sound). Hands, tired hands, dirty pants. The cardhouse man fell down. Now silence is peace - speaks to me. What once was said by sound. CHORUS. I'm free. I'm remembering who I am. My hands can feel again..."
hang up,"Guess who calls you up sometimes and then hangs up the phone. You wonderin' if you did wrong to someone you know. I only call you when I think you won't be home. But when I hear your voice I hang up the telephone. In my imagination I know what to say. Deep in my mental antisocial games I play. I want to talk to you but I can't get past your sweet hello. And when I hear your voice I hang up the telephone. It would be quite advantageous if I could be more courageous. So many things I want to tell you, maybe someday I may just. I always call you when I'm feelin' all alone. But when I hear your voice I hang up the telephone. What do I do when I call you up? (Hang up!). I pretend I'm talkin' and my voice sounds like a dial tone. Can't deal with it or without it, my excuse is dry as bone. I go to pieces and my blood turns into fire - ha. I'm burnin' up inside consumed by my own desire. I wanna get with you but you'll never love a liar. I am the loser - the abuser of the wire. I'm holdin' on to you by hangin' on your stiffing drone. But when I hear your voice I fall into a silent hole. I only call you when I think you won't be home. But when I hear your voice I hang up the telephone. What do I do when I call you up? (Hang up!). hello?"
heart attack,"7am and the kitten jumps on top of the TV so innocently. And knocks the antenna off onto the bed. And it lands on the chest of this still ball of stress. 7am and the pendulum swayed. I hear myself cry out in peace and in pain. The timebomb explodes and my heart ignites. With a burst of white light pure as the first taste of life. It paralyzed and freed me, it stunned and released me. It summarized me in a word I can’t say. And all of my life was shown to me at once. And I saw the total of who I’d become. As if in the end we add up to a number. Like finding the answer to all that you are. Afraid if I move I might trigger my own death. So gently I cling to control over my breath. My left shoulder burning from all I’ve been carrying. Buried alive under my collapsed chest. I lift as my sense of what maters has changed. For I saw the eyes of a Heavenly face. That waits in a place that I no longer fear. As I cherish my every last day I’m still here…. What probably will get me is a car crash in Jersey. And I just can’t wait anymore"
hermit,"I don't want money or a thing. For what I was and what I am and what I'll ever be. I don't need to be overground. I don't need to give away my life or make a sound. All I ever wanted was the thing I couldn't find. Oh I tried to get away - run away, far away. Something kept me in my place - so I stayed and remained. I don't wanna make a judgment call. Take a stand or make demands or try to please you all. All I wanted was the truth and that I couldn't find. Oh I tried to get away - run away, far away. But my shadow followed me - every place, kept my pace. Well I don't belong anyway. Well I missed my call - what a shame. I don't want much of anything. Everything I got I earned through pain and suffering. I don't want you numberin' my days. I don't want you trying to immortalize my name. All I ever wanted was a little peace of mind. In all eyes ugliness was my face - a disgrace. Recognized lowly mess in my place - what a waste. Well I don't belong anyway. Well I missd my call - what a shame. And what I have you can't touch or see. All I have I got from God and that's all I need. All I ever really wanted was to stay inside. Well I tried to believe I was freed - in the lead. Yeah, I thought I could succeed - but it's not my need. Something there was in my way so I stayed - stood in place. Where forever I'll remain - it was not my way. All I wanted was a feeling like I'm warm inside"
higher,"In twenty years what will we say. When we look back on yesterday. Silence falls and I drift into space. This is the time that we will always remember. Living for now making it last forever. These are the best of days. There's nothing in our way. You turn it up and play it over again. This is the time when all our eyes shine brighter. Just you and I and the whole world to fight for. We can make it last. Smile when we look back. Just look inside and feel it over and over again. We take you higher and higher and higher. You feel it over and over again. We take you higher and higher and higher. You feel it over and over again. This is the life, we live again tomorrow. Letting go, the heart will always follow. Nothing is far away. It's just like yesterday. Just look inside and feel it over and over again. We take you higher and higher and higher. You feel it over and over again. We take you higher and higher and higher. You feel it over and over again. Now twenty years have passed us by. And we look back and count the time. Burning like the summer sun. When the world was young. As I lay staring from the ground. And seven trumpets wait to sound. Silence calls and I drift from this place"
i hate me more than i love you,"(Girl, you've been treatin' me so bad - and I think I like it). (Girl, I don't think you understand, so I'm gonna tell ya how it is). You can do anything ya want with me - You can lie and I'll believe. You can tell me stay and I'll be waiting. To be the one who wants to hold your hand - To be your foolish man. And when ya do me wrong I'll say I'm sorry. Someday when ya want me and ya lose the man ya left behind. I say it in my mind but never say it out loud. We both know deep down I'll be the one who's still around. It's breaking all my spirit down and lifting you so high. It's a cruel cruel world. And I've got a girl that shows me it's true. In a world so unkind,. I've got to ask why I'd want to stay with you. Cause I hate me more than I love you. GUEST LYRICIST - ANOMOS:. Self esteem lower than snow at 12 below - Aint never seen nice, so bad is all I know. It's hard to look up when all I feel is down - Explain my pains through instruments with sound. All these years of searchin for the right answers - That you never helped me come closer to. Was it my fault bein' a naive romancer - I took it how it came - I should have been a chancer. Now I open my eyes and see that you're controllin' all of me. It's time to make a choice - but what should I do - When I hate me more than I love you. It's a cruel cruel world. And I've got a girl that shows me it's true. In a world so unkind,. Please don't ask me why - I just might tell the truth. I hate me more than I love you. Ya never showed me any love before. Just a game and ya played me like a cheap hand. The more ya treat me like an open door. The more I like it and keep on crawlin' back again. Draggin me and my dignity across the floor to ya now,. So you can kick me when I'm down. Oh, use me and abuse me - you're never gonna lose me. I can't let go of anything. Punish me, won't ya punish me - I don't deserve all the better things. Punish me, won't ya punish me - I can't forgive an imperfect me. It's a cruel cruel world. And I've got a girl that shows me it's true. In a world so unkind,. I made up my mind - I've got to tell you the truth. I hate me more than I love you. I hate me more than I love you. (Ah ,yeah - there ya have it baby - all for you).

last time,"How does she break me down. Why am I still around?. Piece by piece till I fall. When did I lose my balls. I'm not gonna think about it - this will be the last time.

life inside your ass,"I wanna tell ya what's on my mind. But I'm hopin' baby you can read between the lines. I got this vibe that I hope aint true. But the things ya say don't line up with the things you do. I'm always waitin' for your shit to pass. And it's gettin' like I'm livin' life inside your ass. Ya think you're keepin' me in the dark. But I'm seein' more more more than I want to. Ya want me in a place where I can't read your face. But I'm gettin' what ya got deep inside you. You may act like everything's alright. But down here at the bottom it's gettin' kinda tight. You don't listen to a word I say. I'm just a piece of something you keep locked away. Ya pull me out when you need a man. But I want more than to kill your bugs and lift your bags. Yeah, you keep makin', I keep takin' out your trash. And it's gettin' really crowded up inside your ass. I wanna tell ya what's on my mind.... I got your asshole around my neck. Still I'd rather suffocate than smell what's on your breath. You're so retentive and I'm in the queue. Just waitin' for your heart to come passin' through. But the more I stir it up the more it stinks up fast. And it's gettin' hard to breathe up here inside your ass. I wanna tell ya what's on my mind.... I don't know how long I'm gonna last. I need somethin' to hold, not a bunch of gas. I'm down here waitin' and it's so frustratin'. Guess this is what it's like to live inside your ass. Yeah, you know where to find me - up inside your ass. I don't know how long I'm gonna last"
little brother is watching,"Little brother has taken control. Shoveling dirt in every hole. Predators to condemn your soul. Watching you & watching me. We're all connected but separated. Misunderstood and so frustrated. A million armies of one have invaded. Watching you & watching me. We live behind glass curtains. And act like nothing's wrong. Soon you will belong.

living the dream,"The dust collecting on the pictures & the memories. I shut the door once more and ask what I forgot to bring. A stack of mail will soon appear next to the other three. And that's what happens when life suddenly becomes the dream. I miss my father & the dog I had at seventeen. I start to let it go somewhere at 30, 0000 feet. Take off as who I am and land as who I need to be. I'm livin', livin', livin' the dream. We rise so high. We'll live forever. And touch the sky. The lights burn bright and they start to sing. All together. We're livin', livin', livin' the dream. We take our bow. It's been a pleasure. 'Til our next show. I close my eyes and I start to breathe. In the silence I'm livin', livin', livin' the dream. And dreaming of life. Another day another plane another hotel key. Another letter from a friend in town that I can't see. A paper slides under the door to tell me when to leave. Wake up at 10pm and meet downstairs in the lobby. We sign some autographs and photographs from the last tour. We shake the hands and hug the fans and wish we could do more. They chase the van, we wave a kiss and the girls start to scream. We're livin', livin', livin' the dream. We rise so high. We'll live forever. And touch the sky. The lights burn bright and they start to sing. All together. We're livin', livin', livin' the dream. We take our bow. It's been a pleasure. 'Til our next show. I close my eyes and I start to breathe. In the silence I'm livin', livin', livin' the dream. And dreaming of life. Tonight we smile from here and above. We shine inside. We can last forever if together we love. We rise so high. We'll live forever. And touch the sky. The lights burn bright and they start to sing. All together. We're livin', livin', livin' the dream. We take our bow. It's been a pleasure. 'Til our next show. I close my eyes and I start to breathe. In the silence I'm livin', livin', livin' the dream. And dreaming of life. I've got to go. I won't forget all the love you show. Remember how we made heaven sing. All together. We're livin', livin', livin' the dream. And dreaming of life"
lost,"Somewhere in the forest. I took a break to take my sweet time. Alone in the forest. A man laid himself down to die. Don't know if I ever made it out. Or if the day just turned to night. Had I found up was down. So lost I crossed to the other side. I dug my name in the dirt. Placed below it the date of my birth. The Earth wore my epitaph, it read:. ""We make plans, and God laughs."". We make plans - God laughs.. God laughs - we ask why. Alone in the forest. A man laid himself down to die.. 2nd verse - truth is my curse. Words carry like the buried from the hearse. We make plans - God laughs.. Naked on paths that turn to broken glass. And God laughs - we ask why. But no one hears above the wind as she slips through the trees. Footprints in blood behind me. A man lays down and he sleeps."
maricona,Maricona - can't take my eyes off of you. Maricona - I've changed from the first time I saw you. I never knew what emptiness was. Until I turned away and you were gone. Maricona - I've got a girl to save. Puerca Tonta - she's got a world to blame. Where it's dark all the time. Let me in - I'll be your sunshine. Maricona - can't take my eyes off of you. Maricona - I spend my nights dreaming of you. Waiting to see you again. Waiting to breathe again
meat,"I've got somethin' in my eye - I don't know what is is. I thought it might be a sty - cause all I see are pigs. High-lives rolling in the mud while all I do is try. To save my soul a better seat in the empty sky. Save me from myself. From everyone else pullin' me down the drain. We are nothing - we are meat in the dying game. Save me from my destiny. The weak link in the chain. We are nothing - we are meat - we are all the same. We are nothing - we are meat. Out for #1. In the grinder, in the hole. Running from the gun. I'll be looking down on you if I get that high. Smiling at the frown on you from the empty sky"
mine,"You can't have anything - everything's mine. You can't have my time, my world, my crime. I don't share - I don't care - I'm not that kind. Two for me - nothing for you -it's mine. Drop dead, go fuck yourself, eat shit and die. Choking on yestercorn, ripping your throat like thorns. Pulling the pin out as your clock unwinds. You can't breathe my air - that's fair - it's mine. Heaven is piling up with headless dogs. 'Cause God keeps on forgiving fighters, biters. Only with rabies can we cure the world of talking cancer. Answer: die"
misery,"Misery. She's trying to break free. Caught her flying in and out of dreams. Misery. The sky turns tangerine. Take my hand and give your heart to me. Bring you to a silver sea. Let me kiss you sweet grenadine. You will know just how much you mean to me. Misery. I want you tenderly. Let me show you that you can believe me. Every whisper a melody. Every promise a symphony. Forever you'll be in every word I sing. Misery. Won't you marry me. I will spend a lifetime,. I will search the whole world, darlin',. To find the words that say just how much I love you"
more,"There's more to you than what I see. There's more to you than I can be. There's something, that something. That makes me feel like I'm more. There's more than life inside your heart. There's more than music in your song. There's something, that something. That makes me feel like I'm more. Than I am when I'm with you. A better man when I'm with you. I love who I am when I'm with you. But I love you more than you could ever know. So much more than I could ever show. How much higher we can make it go. There's so much God behind your eyes. They save me and lift me so high. There's something, that something. That makes me feel like I'm more. Than I am when I'm with you. A better man when I'm with you. I love who I am when I'm with you.

myth,"Life is good as long as I can keep my eyes closed till I die in vain.. Life is good from dust to dust - it's been a road of broken trust and pain.. Take my pain away.. I never really wanted more than honored words - you think this life is a game. My time had come and now it's gone - I missed my last day in the sun.. My face has changed - the dogs have won. I never thought I'd ever say I struggled all my life away.. Nobody is ever gonna take this pain away.. It's always the same - some taker of years that live off my breaking back. Empty soul collectors - predators of any shine that ya lack. Ya feedin' on my deed with greed not for green just for your trophy rack. They all come to me - my skin sweet to the ticks swarmin' on me. They all take their little bite and in the end it's like a stab in the back. I'm all out of blood, I gave them too much - but it's still not enough. They come one by one, mask of a friend - over and over again and again. Never ends - guess this was my destiny, to keep trying to climb for eternity. An endless hill while they pull at me, and slide me back down and not let me sleep. And live off my blood - with a mechinal numb dig my fingers in mud and pull my way up. Guess this was my destiny, to keep trying to climb for eternity.. That's my mytholgy.. Take my pain away."
never again,I cared too much. To keep it all together. I'm not a good pretender. I never could live a lie. I said too much. I let it get the best of me. Until it took the rest of me. I thought it was worth the fight. To fight for what's right. To right all the wrongs. To say it in our songs. To know we belong. No one understands. They don't have the desire. Got both hands in the fire. And I'd do it again. We give it all we can. All we have is desire. Got both hands in the fire. We burn & still say. Never say never say never say never again. Never say never say never say never again. I learned more from one enemy. Than from 1000 friends. That heaven takes care. Of fools & scoundrels in the end. You learn more from one lie. Than from 1000 truths. Is all worth dying for you're still not sure. But keep on chargin' through. No one understands. They don't have the desire. Got both hands in the fire. And I'd do it again. We give it all we can. All we have is desire. Got both hands in the fire. We burn & still say. Never say never say never say never again. Never say never say never say never again. Ya can't really ever say never but we. Say it again and again and again again. Never say never say never say never again. To fight for what's right. To right all the wrongs. To say it in our songs. To know we belong. We slowly lose sight. Of what made us strong. The hardest thing to do. Is to let go of your guns. No one understands. They don't have the desire. Got both hands in the fire. And I'd do it again. We give it all we can. All we have is desire. Got both hands in the fire. We burn & still say. Never say never say never say never again. Never say never say never say never again. Ya can't really ever say never but we. Say it again and again and again again. Never say never say never say never again
normal,I just got a new medication. After years of hibernation. I can walk outside for the first time. And let the sunshine touch my head. Never went an hour without. Mutilating from the inside out. Now everything's fine for the first time. I feelin' like I'm born again. I try but can't explain it - I say too much. I feel so liberated - feels like love. It's so nice to be normal - to be normal for a change. I used to stare up at the sky. And watch the little worm in my eye. But now all I wanna do is look at you. And fill your darkest room with light. I try but can't explain it - I say too much. I feel so liberated - feels like love. It's so nice to be normal - to be normal for a change.. It's so nice to be normal - but it still feels kinda strange.. The noise has left my head. The voice inside is dead. Now I don't hear a sound.. Never knew silence could ever be so loud.. It's so nice to be normal - to be normal. It's so nice to be normal - but it still feels kinda strange.
noseplugs,"I could never be unkind. Easy words are hard to find. Let me give it one good try. God, I think that something crawled in your mouth and died. Whatever it was. It died from an unnatural cause. Virus helps it decompose. Ill from a septic drainage pipe while roaming a landfill. I smell you from a mile away. I see how you peel the paint. I can see the fragile faint. The architecture of society has a crack. And you break it down. The hills turn to flattened ground. I can hear the sirens sound. Heavy breathers run for cover the other way. It's a good thing grandpa hung onto that old bomb shelter,. Even though the cold war ended,. It's intended use is to protect the masses. Stomach acid on your breath. You taste like kissing death. The garlic soap you bought worked well. To cover the smell of ol' Assy Pickins. Knocking down your door. Making babies on your floor. Killing daisies down the hall. I know that you never thought he would. Come back and be your side kick. Driving 'long side in a Wildwood tram car but no one can see him. But you, and you defy physics when you go to movie theatres. And you insist on two tickets, and you have him sit next to you. In a seat that someone sits in, but they move when you talk to him. (Thank God for the Mod Squad so you had a hairstyle to assign him,. Though it may be slightly dated that's ok cause you accept him. As is, as is, as is, as is.."
old,Poor obsolete man - I’m a burden to you all. You're leavin' me out in the cold. My spine's collapsing - can't remember what I'm told. My entity gives way to mold. We're growing old - our functions go. We're moving slow - scraping the bone. We grow cold. Maxxing atrophy - turning back into an egg. My brittle frame covers in folds. My teeth are free from the oppression of the jaw. Got a Swiss cheese colon and an artery full of spitballs. We're growing old - our functions go. We're moving slow - scraping the bone. We grow cold
overloaded,"Sometimes I'm feeling like, there's something in the air. That kicks us up into a fight - why do we go there. Is it biology or fucked up chemistry. The whole world seems to be caught in its own misery. Or is it that I only see reflections of me. And that I think there's nothing beyond my line of trees. I think it's time to let it go , yeah I know.... 'Cause it's too short, this thing called life - and I need you in mine. I'm spillin' over with some much love for the whole world to take that it blows my mind. Yeah I'm overloaded - I'm overflowin' - it feels like my soul is pouring out my eyes. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh, yeah. Take and take as much as you can - it's all that's left of me. Ooooh, ooooh, yeah. I fly under the radar, just skimming the line. Between never and forever, between earth and sky. But when I think about it, it washes over me. And pulls me to the dividing line - that's where I sink. Down to the ocean floor, still sad from the last tour. When there were devils amongst - still I go back for more. Maybe it's time to just let it go , yeah I know.... 'Cause it's too short, this thing called life - and I need you in mine. I'm spillin' over with some much love for the whole world to take that it blows my mind. Yeah I'm overloaded - I'm overflowin' - it feels like my soul is pouring out my eyes. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh, yeah. Take and take as much as you can - it's all that's left of me"

real,Your left hand got the finger on the button. Your right forgot how to feel. Your head don't know what either one is doin'. Ya turn nothin' into such a big deal. I've been gettin' all the signals and the signs. And I've been watchin' how ya cheat and steal. And then you try to spin my name into a lie. Now won't anybody tell me what is real.. Are you listening - do you hear a thing. Even through your own shit so deafening. Up on my own feet - you can't make me drop. Try to pull me down - I'll still be on top. Now you started something that you can't stop.. There's a fine line and you think you can cross it. Rollin' along on your entitlement wheel. Who will remember you for self-importance?. At least I got to know what is real.. Well you can keep all your dirty little secrets. Of all the scapegoats you forced to kneel. I saw the world through Jesus-colored glasses. Now won't anybody tell me what is real.
red eye,"Well it started with a sound I never heard before. Then the pushin' and the pullin' me across the floor. I said the last thing we did the night before we die. Was a little drunk girl with a big red eye. It was another late night in tokyo. In another dark club after another show. If the morning light could have got inside. We would have seen the girl had a big red eye. So we crashed out a little bit before the quake. Then I held you tight while the hotel shaked. If the walls came down we would have surely died. Never knowin' the girl had a big red eye. But we lived to see ourselves another day. And we laughed out loud with a foot in the grave. Ya see, the camera had a flash and the pictures don't lie. That little drunk girl had a big red eye. And the toxic waste spilled into the sea. And the air stuck like flypaper to me. It's all one big roller-coaster ride. And last night she got on with a big red eye. The greatest lessons we could learn in life. Are always served the day after we die. All I would have missed as I hit the sky. Was that the little drunk girl had a big red eye"
rockstar for a day,Rockstar For A Day. I just turned 19 for the 16th time. Posing with bottles of the finest wine. I'm only seen with people just like me. So rich that we get everything for free. Spouting politics from my limosine. Because you care - About the product in my hair. About the clothes I'm gonna wear. To the event where we congratulate ourselves. I wanna be a rockstar for a day - I want my 15 minutes of fame. But I've got face that's made for radio - And my body's a disgrace. I wanna be a rockstar for a day - I wanna get botox in LA.

But I've got face that's made for radio - And I never could get laid. So I wanna be a rockstar for a day - I'm gonna get a pornstar for a date.

ronald's comin' back now,Hey babe. It's been a lonely time without my lady. Too many nights - I'm coming for ya baby. I've missed you for so long. I need to be with you and never be gone. Hey sista. I left you for a dark and empty room. You opened up the door and pulled me through. You opened up my eyes. I'll love you and be by your side every day of our lives. Ronald's coming back now and he's here to stay. Back to give ya lovin' every day. Now I'm here and you're gone - it's so hard to go on. Just one day without you is too long a time.

Just one day without you is too long a time. Counting every hour in my mind. Now I know. Gone off making foolish moves. Wasting loyalty on those who prove. That my 1-face and wasted faith. Should have had more eyes to see your two-sides. And all the times you picked and choosed. Which more destructive mask you'd use. With brothers like you who needs cancer. I won't answer - I'll just leave you behind. Ronald's coming back now and he's here to stay. Back to give ya lovin' every day. Now I'm here and your gone - it's so hard to go on. Just one day without you is too long a time. Counting every hour in my mind. Now I know. To be here all alone. I'm so sorry that I left you alone. Now I know
rowboat,"ROWBOAT. Sand and wind burns the back of my throat. I fell while standing on my rowboat. Salt water tightens on my skin coat. I drowned - my head smacked to the rowboat. I floated through the plains of sea - an old pork chop greeted me. It was thankful for the company of a dead man who once might have ate him. I miss my rowboat - left it on the shore 10 feet above me. I never noticed the chipped paint on the bottom. And now I get to see things from a different view. The sea did vandalize with natural shades of green. Under what circumstance would I ever have had the opportunity to find out?. True pond scum always rises to the top of the water. I, on the other hand, am false pond scum and remain below. I swim the seven liquid gallows. I'm furniture for budding tadpoles. Sock-sogged and waterlogged I slow-bloat. One with the bog - fate sailed my rowboat. I'd kiss you but my lips are feed for tuna getting back at me. I am the Ronald-Of-the-Sea in a swimsuit that no longer fits me. I'd love you but my brain is cheese - my body's 59 degrees. And if I could I'd surely sneeze 'cause my nose is filled with red snapper. I'd hold you but my arms are weak - this whole thing won't help my physique. And to my neighbors I'm a freak - they're a fish hook, an old shoe and... (???). I'd sing to you but I can't make sounds - there are no more bubbles in my mouth. And when I said I would head South to retire I meant Florida. I'm running out of words to sing - this fading out is a good thing. La da di da da da da da..."
shadow,"I can hear the sound again. Voices dancing in my head. Smile wide - drowning slowly as the echoes rise. Angels pounding at my door. They want to take away my war. I won't let them carve away the edges anymore. No more.... I can feel my face changing. Every day must have its night. Every curse is a blessing. Like a shadow in the light. Life is beautiful and crazy. Isn't it just like you and I. It's alright - like a shadow in the light. Her ear pressed to my chest. She can almost hear my breath. Don't you cry - it's ok - I chose it all this time.... Every story has an ending. Even though words never die. Every curse is a blessing. Like a shadow in the light. Winter won't last forever. And neither will I. It's alright.... Thank you God for all these choices. In the boundaries of your game. Through the silence and the voices. All my love will never change. It was so nice to be normal. To be normal for a change. So strange.... It was so nice to be normal - but what's normal, anyway?"
she knows,"I forgot her name - 100 girls look the same. When I close my eyes - All I do is fantasize. And she knows - she goes,. ""Tell me I'm the only one on your mind,. When you close your eyes"". All I wanna do is give my song to you. She looks away - I ask why but she won't say. It's cause she knows - it shows. So how can I stop the tears my baby cries,. When I close my eyes. Hush little baby, don't ya know you're my lady. And ya know we're always gonna be together. If I'm lyin' let the sun stop shinin'. Cause I'll have you to light my way forever. What else can I say?. And she knows - she goes,. ""Tell me I'm the only one on your mind,. When you close your eyes"". So how can I stop the tears my baby's cryin'. How can I let her know my heart never lies. When I close my eyes"
shell,"The cruel taste me like a cancer eats. My bone's been cleaned - still my body breathes. And everything goes. Sit on cracked walls - why I fall. Up and out, pain was noise - someone broke Sorrow’s toy. Inside out pours the void from my wounds. The shell was destroyed. We all fall down. We all fall down. Hit the ground - emptied out. Kings horses and men put me here again. I'm back on the wall - should I stay or fall. And go through it all. I feel so well - empty shell. Up and out, pain was noise - someone broke Sorrow’s toy. Inside out pours the void from my wounds. The shell was destroyed. We all fall down. We all fall down. Hit the ground - emptied out. Life and heart painted the ground. Know why I fall - sitting on cracked walls. We all fall down onto shaky ground. I can't stand at all. We all spin round - shaky ground. We all fall down. We all fall down. Hit the ground - emptied out. Threw the red blanket down. We all fall down"

sleepwalking,"And the broken saints are walking. Far far away. In their sleep since yesterday. Far far away. They stopped counting by the last mile. Far far away. No one asking to be saved. And the cold wind keeps on blowing. I let it lead me astray. Looking for a path to follow. In the darkest of our days. And I crossed all the lines we had drawn. Cut all the ties we had formed. Told all the lies to myself. While sleepwalking through it all. I was knelt before the crossing. Far far away. When they found me all alone. Far far away. They said, we need someone who needs answers. Far far away. And you've been longing to be told. All the lost ones they keep calling. With their faces to the ground. To the band our steps are marching. Growing distant from the sound. And I crossed all the lines we had drawn. Cut all the ties we had formed. Told all the lies to myself. While sleepwalking through it all. I'm far far away. From where I think I am. I'm far far away. From who I really am. I'm far far away. My eyes closed for so long. I'm far far away. And what I knew was wrong. I'm far far away. Some call it lost, some call it free. I'm far far away. Let go and you'll find what you need. Sleepwalking we're free. Sleepwalking with me. Far far away. And we fade into the dawn. And I crossed all the lines we had drawn. Cut all the ties we had formed. Told all the lies to myself. While sleepwalking through it all"
swatting flies,"I'm down here by myself. Pickin' dust off the shelf. Company I don't need I don't like to share. I'm surrounded by spies. I feel their segmented eyes. Burnin' holes in my back with predator stare. Something's fillin' my space. Someone's takin' my place. Something's circlin' interrupting my prayer. And I was sick as a dog. And I was lickin' the frog. And I was fillin' the hole I dug in the air. And I was alone - just the two of us. And I heard a drone - so I looked around. To find the sound - yeah, up and down. On the ground - it was you and I swatting flies. Something's suckin' my spine. Swallowin' all that is mine. I'm kissin' the leeches that bury their heads in my skin. Now I'm pickin' my locks. Now I'm breakin' my box. Embracing the kindness of parasites tryin' to get in"
sweetmeat,"SWEETMEAT. My engine is blown. My balance is thrown. I pushed myself up the hill. And fell to the kill. I degenerate. Collapsed at my gate. I challenged my weakened knees. And fell to disease. The higher we climb the wall. The longer the fall. The decline, the defeat. The decay pickled me. Like a vinegar bath in a jar. Just like flies livin' off the sweetmeat. Have you met my dead friend, Swollen, the head?. Have I introduced you to my lung friend, The Flu?. But friends that won't leave. Steal the air you breathe. They eat up your final food. None left for you. With smiling friends like these. Who needs enemies. CHORUS. And more with every hour that came, I sank down. With smiling friends like these. There will be no peace"

thank you,Thank you for being such a friend. You're by my side through thick and thin. And when these days come to an end. I know I'll be with you again. For all the times we're up and down. You know you never let me down. We've turned the page so many times. There's still so much more left to write. Thank you for all you let me be. And for euphoric memories. For the 15 minutes of fame. And all the pretty ugly things. For filling empty rooms with light. And for the sins thrown in the sea. For flowing in and out my eyes. And the taste of life between my teeth. I'll say it now while I still have the opportunity to breathe. I suffocated for so long and then you gave my heart its beat. We may be oceans far apart but deep inside you're still with me. I know we'll always be together every time I hear you sing.... A spinning world that never stops. The pushin' pushin' till we drop. The miracle of endless days. Music that never goes away. It keeps my spirit livin' on. With you in every song. So thank you and goodnight. Till I see you again on the other side...
the color of justice,"The Color Of Justice. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget to bring your suntan lotion. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget to bring an ice cool ocean. Thank you for the vision of truth – you’ve shown me the world like I’d never seen. How right and wrong are clear as day – but the color of justice is green. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget to bring what ya got paid to. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget the pictures of those poisoned by you. Thank you for making me stare into the dark and focus on the ugliest scene. Where right and wrong are too clear to see and all you’re looking for is green. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget to rot in your empty shell. Good luck in the afterlife – don’t forget the way you made this life Hell. Thank you for the taste of blood pressed from the life between my teeth. When right and wrong were chewed away – and you left the taste of grief. Remember all the people you showed no love to.. Remember all the people you drove to hate you.. Remember all the people you were a disease to.. Remember all the people you wouldn’t say please to.. Remember all the people that offered compassion.. Remember all the people that you turned your back on.. Remember when you sold your last decency. When you’re done, remember me."
time,"I thought I could find my reflection off the inside of a blind eye. But all I had to go by were the lying images. Breaking with the fading ripples of time. I can only give what I got. But all I have is what I wanna see. So you can ask for anything. But I can't share an invisible piece of me. Like a mask - the inside is the opposite face from the outside. And the tougher the skin, or the brighter the grin,. The more we shelter from the world - or maybe just from ourselves. So when ya pulled the trigger, thought it made ya bigger. Only from where you can see. Ya think the bitter cold is being bold. But all y'are is frightened of your own humanity. Half my friends are dead. The other half are living off their piece of borrowed time. All I can do is pray for you. And hope you seek out what ya need to find:. Time. Ya killed time. Ya got time. Now it's your time. And ya gotta find a way to stop time"
top of the world,"A little girl up on a ledge. Lookin down from on top of the world. Ready to take a step into waiting arms. To hold her as her body falls. There's a little girl lost. Somewhere on top of the world. She wants to lay her head on a pillow of clouds. And pull a blanket of sky over her head. The world spinnin and crashin into her all the time. But this time (it's her instead). Standin on the edge. Lookin down from on top of the world. SOLO 1. She says goodbye to all the beautiful things. And closes her eyes and listens. To the water passing under the bridge - reminds her. Of the whisper of a man she was once missin'. Only in the past will time forever last. And she's gonna fly (Dweezil now say goodbye...). SOLO 2 (Dweezil). Little girl up on a ledge. Lookin down from on top of the world. She steps forward. And her breath connects to the sky as her body curls. She smiles as all wishes are granted - to fly. Like she does in that recurring dream.. Free.. Collision.. Shock.. She shatters, opens, becomes the river.. But for a moment, she was on top of the world.. She ends.. Like a song, we end."
tuesday in nancy,Tuesday night somebody died. While I was off living my lie. And I was blind but in my mind. All was fine to me. All must pass - nothing can last. We carry on - the line moves along. So who will cry for you?. I might - every time I breathe. Visit me in my sad dream. And tell me how I can find peace. Then tell me why the sad survive. And why we have such selfish minds. We think of our losses while your spirit flies. You took me with you - but I'll be back in time. Tuesday night someone died. But all is fine to me. Cause now I see.
turn around,"Today I lost my poetry, intensity. Somewhere in-between entropy, atrophy. In quiet harsh, this grind. Of distract left my mind. I spit dust, but I feel fine. Another pill goes down. Today I found my sanity, empathy. Just underneath simplicity, memory. Thus with a kiss I die. I'll let go, you hold tight. This change is not goodbye. Sins thrown in the sea floating away now. Waiting and hoping so far away now. Eyes keep on burning, heads keep on turning around. They turn around. I stare into obscurity in front of me. I'd rather fight the salty breeze blinding me. Than look at what's behind. I've washed it from my mind. I've washed it from my mind. Sins thrown in the sea floating away now. Waiting and hoping so far away now. Eyes keep on burning, heads keep on turning around. They turn around"
vomit,"I used to think my thoughts made me mad - then I realized I was just mad, with thoughts. Taught my hands to speak my mind - the inside of a fist is soft. Had 6 strings to take my mind off of things - to ventilate hostility with positivity. And control my aggressive tendencies - cause what I am is what you hear. It's a piece of me to outlive my flesh - and continue my bloodline. Like a child, yet complete in it's form - like a child, but you can't mold it wrong. An angry kid becomes an angry man. And the pendulum swings like a thinking mind. The pendulum swings and it passes time. Like a mood it swings me wide. Until I've lost my balance and fallen to it. Like a mindquake it puts me through it. Like a hand shake it greets me. As it cheats me of a content life. And in the end we bend to make amends. Before your own angst eats ya. And to those that made winter so cold. I hope your food repeats ya. And in my darkest room I feel my way through - guided by a short leash. Made of sound to keep down - the part of me I fear. It's a piece of me that puts my flesh to the test - gives it power. And devours my awareness - of what's waiting under my skin. ...and in the end we bend to make amends. Cause any one of us can blow up. And so I'm not covered in your food before ya do. I really hope ya throw up. ...and in the end we bend to make amends. Cause any one of us can blow up. Since I'll be there to collect my share. I'd like to see ya throw up"
wasted away,"2 years today, I just pulled the blankets off the mirrors for the first time. Surprised at the new lines on my face that remind how I tried to catch an illusion. Hiding from me, hiding from facing the height of what I hope to be. Kept all my eggs in someone else's basket. Thinking they would care enough to not let someone smash it. What's wrong with me, I got this need to give back to a world that keeps me. And if I do just for myself it's like I'm selfish. 'Cause I always had this thing about staying grounded and down. And it's not been worth it to share with the people I pick that I sought to prove they care. And I feel like a pussy sayin' shit out loud. But I'm openin' my eyes and I see myself now. I left myself behind. While chasing after dreams I could never find. I lived for all your lives. A machine for you to unplug at any time. I just realized today that I've wasted away. Maybe it's too late - the end has a date - and I'm cramming for the final test. It hasn't been a total mess, I'm just striving for higher. And humility will build me if I confess. Some people do what they chose some people look for every bump in the road. And some pretend and they play a good role. For the people that depend - they all come and go. Wrote half an album in 2 long days as I reflected and tried to take a hard next step. Of a spiritual kind so maybe I can find some sense as I pick apart a burdened mind. So I spread out on the floor all the pieces that I thought were fully formed. I see how much more I've got to go. I reach for a new drug to medicate my soul. I left myself behind. While chasing after dreams I could never find. I lived for all your lives. A machine for you to unplug at any time. Just realized today. I left myself behind. While chasing after dreams I could never find. I lived for all your lives. To forget about the answers I need to find. I just realized today that I've wasted away"
what i knew,"So break the chain, deflate the pain. And erase the hate of the place you fell in. You dwellin' in stink and your mind goes slowly. Shrinking, breaking down in the sour soup. The mind is tickin' on borrowed time. And your heart won't beat on the jump start. You're 28 feet beneath the ground. And you won't be climbin' soon. Never would have been with you, knewing what I knew. Never would have give you love, doing what I do. Too late to give you up, knewing what I knew. Look what I knew.... I knew nothing - there was something there. And I saw it - I just didn't care. And now it's got me by the hair. Nurturing my face in shit. The truth was hanging right behind my head. Like a fat carrot on a stick. Now I move forward dumb and blind. Or backward chasing it. CHORUS"
women rule the world,"They let us play with all our toys. They let us think that we're big boys. They let us make the louder noise, but. Women rule the world. They let us think we're superman. That we're the only ones who can be strong. But we break on command, 'cause. Women rule the world. I try to act so cool but you know I'm just a fool for you, for you. I won't stop til I reach the top just to be there with you, with you. And I still trip over my feet. And my heart still skips a beat. I'm such a lucky guy 'cause after all this time. It's like the deeper I go the deeper I fall. The deeper I go the deeper I fall. They touch so gentle, play so fair. Mend our wounds with love and care. But they can crush us with a stare, 'cause. Women rule the world. We are the fighters, we control. We're always right, they let it go. Behind that pretty smile they know that. Women rule the world. I try to act so cool but you know I'm just a fool for you, for you. I won't stop til I reach the top just to be there with you, with you. And I still trip over my feet. And my heart still skips a beat. I'm such a lucky guy 'cause after all this time. It's like the deeper I go the deeper I fall. The deeper I go the deeper I fall. We launch 1000 ships into the rocks. And from the cliffs they watch. Us sink down in our thorny crowns. Women rule the world. And beggars dressed as emperors. Offering you 7 wonders. Promising the deepest thunder. Women rule the world. We'll tell you you're the perfect girl. We'll crawl for miles through the sand. To win your hand and be your man. Women rule the world. I try to act so cool but you know I'm just a fool for you, for you. I won't stop til I reach the top just to be there with you, with you. And I still trip over my feet. And my heart still skips a beat. I'm such a lucky guy 'cause after all this time. It's like the deeper I go the deeper I fall. The deeper I go the deeper I fall"
