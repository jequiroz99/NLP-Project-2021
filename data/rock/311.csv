8:16 a.m.,Stranger flowers yet. There will never come a day that will ever regret. The hours days years and the minutes. The joy the pain the sunshine and rain in it. The drives on the coast to nowhere. Nothing to say just sit and stare. There's nothing like the comfort of a silence that's comfortable. Not talking small just skip the bull. Then I find myself in servility. Didn't think that was my ability. I go a yard and a mile to make you smile. But then I'm happy see. I got so many ways to make your gaze elliptical. Got a ways to go future's so. Criptical and I'm glad. Just another many things we've had. It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me. The first thing that you see. My eyes open I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me. The day starts carefully. On the sidewalk with the dog. You're right last night I was a hog. Come on I'm sorry. It's 73 degrees. January easily glides. Stranger flowers still. If you're gonna wanna go another day I will. Like this make it a deal. Sealed with a kiss. Sealed with a fell of impermanent bliss. Today my love we shall let the world slide. Turn off the ringer and just glide. For we shall never be youger again than. What do you see. It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me. The first thing that you see. My eyes open I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me. The day starts carefully. On the sidewalk with the dog. You're right last night I was a hog. Come on I'm sorry.

Didn't want to do it. Thats not what were about. But we got to have a limit. How low can you get it. Seems about time to. Change the subject. And sing about the wise eyed. That makes me feel. Good and never do. I leave misunderstood. Damn you know I feel good true. I got a choice of what I'm gonna do It's like this that. Swingin on my bat. Mix a melody with some back chat. Tell 'em again. Dam I know you feel good too. You got a choice of what you're gonna do it's like this that. Nippin' on a cat. Mix a melody with some back chat. I'm rollin' slow no particular place to go so nothings changed. The more things stay the same the more it doesn't matter. To a latte day St. Bernard acting hard. But I throw down like a crazy retard. But what cold make a man. Wanna walk around the school yard with his tool hard. What could make the switch to call a woman a bitch. It probably downed when you couldn't get a date to the prom. And you were stuck with Beavis. Let's leave us on a note of positivity. I'm saying this for levity. But if I leave it brief I call it brevity. I said I see the people rocking. Which means there's no stopping the flow. And you can just tell 'em that you know. Every night yeah we turning up. And comin' off live. Like and final 311 battle breakin idols. On the one you never heard before. You know the hardcore rockin. Pumping the dance floor. Leave ya feet sore lookin for your Micatin. Cecause the mic is deadly int he mood we in. Certified not fakin coool like a Jamaican. Every time the enemy hear us they will be shakin'. ."
time is precious,Watching the ice melt between us. Just faster than grass grows. ItÃ­s not the best that weÃ­ve seen us. But nothing else I'd have chose. Reminds me of a time.

I wonÃ­t go down. Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didnÃ­t miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. When you fight to resist. Emotion with a fist.

"1,2,3",Long time did I run down like that. I would have three years ago-today but not now. It's not like that. It's all right to feel good. It's all for nothing to be wrong.

8:16 a.m.,Stranger flowers yet. There will never come a day that will ever regret. The hours days years and the minutes. The joy the pain the sunshine and rain in it. The drives on the coast to nowhere. Nothing to say just sit and stare. There's nothing like the comfort of a silence that's comfortable. Not talking small just skip the bull. Then I find myself in servility. Didn't think that was my ability. I go a yard and a mile to make you smile. But then I'm happy see. I got so many ways to make your gaze elliptical. Got a ways to go future's so. Criptical and I'm glad. Just another many things we've had. It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me. The first thing that you see. My eyes open I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me. The day starts carefully. On the sidewalk with the dog. You're right last night I was a hog. Come on I'm sorry. It's 73 degrees. January easily glides. Stranger flowers still. If you're gonna wanna go another day I will. Like this make it a deal. Sealed with a kiss. Sealed with a fell of impermanent bliss. Today my love we shall let the world slide. Turn off the ringer and just glide. For we shall never be youger again than. What do you see. It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me. The first thing that you see. My eyes open I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me. The day starts carefully. On the sidewalk with the dog. You're right last night I was a hog. Come on I'm sorry. Holiday on the radio. Billie knows that is the way to go. A place where we both can spend out saved time. Not collecting interest. Maybe the same reason we always find ourselved home bound. I've got to do some homework. The leave response we want to leave Wisconsin. For a new life a new trailer with an antenna and a porch. Of course we'll bring the dog. .

Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally. You ought to know what brings me here. You glide through my head blind to fear. And I know why. (Chorus 2x). You live too far away. Your voice rings like a bell anyway. Don't give up your independence. Unless it feels so right. Nothing good comes easily. Sometimes you gotta fight. (Chorus). Launched a thousand ships in my heart.

and a ways to go,"Searching for something. A million miles and a ways to go. Ending up wondering. Moments I think I know. The answer seems to allude me. Searching for something. A million miles and a ways to go. Sifting through nothing. Liquid you cannot hold. Destination nowhere ooh. Destination nowhere ooh-ooh. Bro I had a dream man it was buried in lore. That I was sailing on the seas and I was out to explore. And it was lucid in a way homey I didn’t need oars uh-uh. I had a feeling that I’d been there before yo. I hit shore it was shrouded in mist. And in the distance coming in view a primordial forest. A people then approached waving their hands. They were speaking in a tongue I could not understand. They led me though at last to a beautiful fire. And it deepened in a way that I forgot I admired. What emerged was more than the wholeness within. I’d seen the men who had been me the beasts I had been. Searching for something. A million miles and a ways to go. Sifting through nothing. The sand you cannot hold. Destination nowhere ooh. Destination nowhere ooh-ooh. A shaman held a rattle that he started to shake. Anxiety was filling me and was this all a mistake. An elder fell to the ground marking the dirt. He was drawing up a map defining sky and the earth. He pointed to the east, north, west, and the south. And then he pointed to the heavens and he started to shout. The women in the front at once began to chant. While the men beat on drums and that elder man danced. Come on yeah it’ll be alright and we’re gonna take a ride. I don’t know if we’ll come back. Come on yeah it’ll be alright and we’re gonna take a ride. I don’t know if we’ll come back. Come on yeah it’ll be alright and we’re gonna take a ride. I don’t know if we’ll come back.

A waiter in the Dorothy Pavilion in '89. I met some wierdos and had myself a real good time. Downtown L.A. is a soul graveyard. Where you got to be hard or get jacked. It lacked a certain sense of something. Something basic no karm int he least I broke east. You know I had to face it. I guess I flaked but it was no mistake because. 311's got the boom. My mic check is giving me. Electric company. I can't see the high wide sky. Or stars above me. Are you a flower. Or more like a high rise tower. If so the soul of sweet delight. On you will shower. There's a place for us they say is somewhere. Not a dream but a place and you will be there. Your slippin' but content because your spirit. And hills are alive with the sound of music. .

champagne,"I will never understand you. When will I stop trying. I mean cuz it's just not how I planned to. Spend, my time til dying. I mean. Chorus:. Champagne. California on the brain. She's got an appetite for no refrains. Just verses she curses as blood vessels burst in defiance. She made an alliance to the dark side of Hollywood. Where everything looks good so I treat her as any other player would. Lightly, the she wants to fight me. Too bad, that's just too bad. I can't be around to pick up your bags. And your debts, she wants to love me with threats. Not taking chances, I'm hedging bets. With other girls I'm not providing pearls. I'm free, free. I will never understand you. When will I stop trying. I mean cuz it's just not how I planned to. Spend, my time til dying. I mean, I know loving me isn't easy. I'm home and next thing I'm leaving but when I look at you it's like praying with my eyes. I follow you to sleep so I will find your dream place. And hey, I'm not an angel but girl you make me feel like I know one. (Chorus)."

And through the rest I sift. Is there ever a time?. When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind. Highly frustrated wanna feel elated. Come monday morn you fell checkmated. You can be uncool and become the rule. Exceptions were made to drown. I’m not used to it, you’d think I’d be by now. The ins the outs the ups and the downs. I wanna make a mess. I wanna blow off stress. I wanna stoke the fire. Just creatures for a while. It comes and goes and comes and goes. Sometimes I go a little crazy. Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do. I know what you we’re gonna say. But were afraid to cause dismay. You’re lyrics switched around. The mixture watered down. And now a pointless display. It’s something one won’t understand. Unless there in it with me hand and hand. Don’t buy the fear don’t buy that my dear. The things you love you must keep near and. Carry on and you won’t feel withdrawn. Even if you’re coming down. Sometimes it’s wearable sometimes is bearable. I careen towards balance til’ the glass is full. I wanna make a mess. I wanna blow off stress. I wanna stoke the fire. Just creatures for a while. It comes and goes and comes and goes. Sometimes. Sometimes I get a little out there. Sometimes I go off. Sometimes just like you. Watch it now!. Sometimes I go a little crazy. Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do. Sometimes I go a little crazy. Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do."

But to you it's a stupid dumb stigma. That's right it's outta sight. Let me tell you 'bout my baby. She loves me don't mean maybe. She knows what I think and I don't have to say it. I love her so I don't have to play it. We sit and drink in the sun. I raise my glass and say she's the one. Cool breeze light squeeze life. Take my advice don't think twice. Let me take you way down south. Step back I'm about to get hectic. Chalk it up as another dialectic. Hard like a jam. Smooth like a ballad. Call it what you want but I call it sound salad. A salad grown in the garden of Eden. Seekin' out pleasures like my boys in Sweden. That's right the grooves tight like. Sit back just relax, let your mind unwind. Pull your good thing close, let tranquility surround. Psychedelic freak out taco funk frolic. Grind fiend roots 'core soul music what have you. Step back and think about the topic of this song. Strong innuendo end over end goes your brain. I won't say it's plain figure it out here's a clue. It's about winding, grinding, finding that spot. That get's her hot the joy of giving pleasure. Is beyond measure."
ebb and flow,"In the basement waiting for a statement. But station? s frequency is vacant. Why don? t we go outside. In the break room waiting for a big boom. Smoke haze rising in a big plume. Everyone? s dissatisfied. The pools have dried the trial? s been tried. But the leak? s still spilling they don? t know what to do. The flow won? t stop pressure still won? t drop. Tanks are overfilling. Forward we crawl backwards we fall through the ebb and the flow. Living within a dream wading through the stream beyond the ebb and flow. Up late to earn the proceeds. All stressed out, working until your eyes bleed. Overtime to buy things we don? t need. Always on the go and you? re thirty thirty. Gotta make the ends and get dirty dirty. Will it ever stop will it ever end. Is it worthy. Reality of this is you go loco loco. And too much of this way and you? ll go postal postal. Happens all the time just get in line. And go comatose. The moms and pops have all closed up shop. And who can blame them? I don? t know anyone. The kids just hide scared to go outside. And just who can blame them?. At times it seems unreal. We can see but we can? t feel. And no one? s at the wheel. Born here all alone. Growing old with hearts of stone. The lights are on but no one? s home"
electricity,This song started as a rant against haters. But that'd be giving in to the instigators. If there is one thing I'd like to pull off. When someone steps with hate all I do is just scoff. You can't burn me (2x). The same force that flows through every circuit. The juice that's spent everytime you work it. Every life form is based on this simplicity. The soul that you have is electricity. You can't avoid that. Evolution is fact. We're all from the same Lucy. Despite differences you see. I'm in disbelief at what people will believe. All along I thought we had our hearts on our shirtsleeve. If one thing I can say as a piece of advice. Don't believe it till you see it and then see it twice. It's so funny (2x). The same force that flows through every circuit. The juice that's spent everytime you work it. Every life form is based on this simplicity. The soul that you have is electricity. You can't avoid that. Evolution is fact. We're all from the same Lucy. Despite differences you see. A call out for unity. In every province and city. What do you think we've been saying. Since we first started playing.
eons,"You got a wishing well within. That’s ready to begin. See how we roll. See how we roll. I’m trying to compromise. Because with me there are no lies. See how we run. It’s already begun. Now that I’m back to a pushing pen. That weighs two hundred tons. I’d like to drop it on you. And watch it all fall through. Nobody knows just what. You’re battling inside. You can hide. Nobody knows just why. Most everyone will lie. If they need to. The ones who aggravate you most. And happen to be ever close. Seem to be the ones lurching. For the same things that you are searching. The ones that make you feel ill. And you think that nature should have killed. Those you curse when you’re alone. Seem to be so close to home. (Chorus x2). Not an even field to be on. Feels like standing still for eons and eons. Stare it dead in the eye, what now?. All we can do is try to shut it down. Shut it down."

existential hero,"Whole world! From the high country to the bottom of the sea. I caught a place that I needed to be. It comes and it goes, the momentary glory. Then, quick as they came they? re down the drain. Another one coming from a shallow place will not remain. Remember when what was possible would never end. Now we abide by limits I cannot defend. It fits good and yet the best we reject. You get what you get I guess don? t get upset. Where is that garden of eden. Under stars and the trees and. And so far, so far from the heathens. Planets follow patterns, we fall into seasons. Flowing like a river we broaden and deepen. Hold on, before we are gone. Got lots to do but time with you. Keeps on sliding. And I keep on blowing a fuse, there you go. Unseen, your face in the screen. I feel your attention dividing. But this is worth more than the news. Prepare to bare all. I paint the cave walls. I am the hobbit. With the ring in the forrest. I am the richest I am the poorest. A particle I vibe I just keep dancin?. I move from this world into a mansion. Of light and love as below and above. I chart the planets and the whales migration. I? m home everywhere I run the station. The last light of a dying star. In every game I am that wild card. I participate I? m paleolithic. And geology and astrophysics. A true cowboy existential hero. I compiled that deck and named it tarot. I? m in play I want the ball. I? m buddha with amnesia then sudden recall. Somehow I fell into it all again, it all again. Somehow I fell into it all again, it all makes sense. Somehow I fell into it all again, it all make sense. Somehow it was here all along"
fat chance/fuck the bullshit,"Na na na na na na. Aw yea. I've seen the devil and the devil is coke. Not down like that cuz it ain't a fuckin joke. Trip ther shrooms fantastic. Shit gets drasctic.

And I'm what you might call a heretic. Yes, and I am from Nebraska. My girl is satisfied, you can ask her. You know I've never visited Alaska. Huh, where the oil was spilt. That drunken captain should be killed. For polluting the sea, an atrocity. He still walks free, well. This one goes to all the birds that drown. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Just fuck the bullshit ??????. It's time to throw down and so I said it words of. Wisdom that will keep you guessing cause. I'm tired of laying and I'm tired of messing around. With all those suckers. Yes, those stupid mother fuckers. Who put down what we do. We stand alone with the group that's new. If I was a dwarf, I'd surely be Dopey. I'm a stone wheat thin you can not culture. Kick in the teeth a condescending frown. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Yeah, right about now I'd like to turn the mic over to my man. SA Martinez. I am sly in the mix I am the mix master. Death and destructor, lyric conductor. Rollin with the rhythm of the rhyme I'm rollin. ???????????????????????. Tim, he leads giutar,he's got the jets. Now the b-boys rockin breakin' moves on the floor. 311's stepping out and you're yellin for more. I'm hoping, I'm poetry in motion. ????????????????????????. P-Nut, the bass drum is booming. And in your mouth the rhythm is booming. P to the N to the U to the T. Just fuck the has-been's and their stupid-ass rambling. Brothers saying bullshit you can't come through with. Do it in the basement no complacence. It's time to kick the fuck in. Begin to win no sin and then. Share it, declare it in the public domain. Refrain. I'd be perfectly glad if rap was a fad but it's not. So I'd thought I'd come out with a shot. Super dumb lyrics make you think I'm a clown. I don't give a fuck it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down. Fuck the bullshit it's time to throw down.

feels so good,"Well everybodys got an opinion thats loud and unbending. I spend my time healing and mending, together. Its a question of whether live positive well i give. P-Nut joins our back, must be arthritic. Tim is from the '70's and so we live it. SA has the wisdom of a nobel laureate. I'm down for our days of glory. It's easy to do when you're up with Sexton. A rhythmatic genius, turnin' up the next one. Would you know, you're a bro, I flow in that circumstance. You'll get your chance. Becuase payback is a motherfuckin' mission. To the sharp-ass rocks slippin' on us but we rock. It comes to writing on us derision. Sendin you a voice now we're sending you a vision. And those who fought me they say they taught me everything I know. I go aww, when I hear that, that chit and that caht, bullshit!. So sick of me knowing everything, saying!. In your face. That's right. And it feels so good. In your face. Yeah. It feels so good. Take it to 'em bro, throw down, now say. Settin' forth a course I'm really wiggin' out. In my dome I roam, no time to doubt. Fucked up you right there while I was rhymin'. Now you're sulking in the corner, a baby crying. Hittin' up now we feelin' to rock Mars. Fuckin' up the shit, now their heads bob. We ain't new to jack swing, the groove and that. We got crazy factiffs and we all that. I don't often rock and I'm a laureate. I don't pull the punch you know I'm throwin' it. Freestyles my style on the mic and flex. You're stalkin' the mind of a punk that's next. I get retarted now that I started you know. A condition which I keep close together. Like the kind buds you know my scene. My team thinks I sing supreme, but you, the weasel,. Try to bring us down but in reality it make you look like a clown. Too bad cause we'll be sittin' in the sun and choose a rocky ass fast ball. In your face. That's right. And it feels so good. Choose a lock y'all. In your face. Yeah. It feels so good. Yo P-Nut, beat that thing. Won't you warm the mic Nicholas. Can't get with this my stream of conscieceness is a sea. Much like Bukowski with a rage. Speakin' to page. Beasts in the cage. Jumpin' off the stage. Divin'. Thrivin'. Strivin' for a better day or say. (Strive for a better day SA?). Beat back by flesh. Shatterd doors braggin' fists to the sky we're feelin' high. Has to live and die. Just take a moment to have a fit once in a while. You know, you know. I do it daily and like it but that's my style, yeah, here I go. In your face. And dow your throat. And it feels so good. 'fraid so. Fuck it up y'all. In you face. And down your throat. It feels so good. That's all."
firewater,Music: Sexton; Lyrics: Hexum/Martinez. Talkin shit like shut up and listen to me. Because cutting through the crap is my speciality. Like a bomb I'm dropping yes a ton of lead. You're trying to figure out the last thing I said. I'm a redwood I love to be a tree yes I'm a druid. My words are flowing out like a fluid. Never give in never conform. I'll be bustin' out rhymes in a triplet form. Dead leaves on the trees in spring. Can't hear the birds sing. A light powdered snow on the ground is glistening. Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver. A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver. While I doze I suppose I could get lost. With a brownskin friend claiming kin to crazy horse. I stink of vino my greasy clothes are rancid but. I tip the bottle back the spirits are in me kid. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Whiskey be spittle at the corners of my mouth. I'm rather liquored light flickers. I got the shakes and jitters. I roll I'm like raging bull bumrushin' the show. Hand to my head sway in the fire I've waded into. All alone except for the whiskey voices. Whores laught neon signs flash other choices. I stagger stumble to toast the past while I mumble. Slur my song slow porno show marquee words crumble. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. You're hangin' around the house with all your friends. Steady drinking smoking the green weed. And head is sort of blinking. You're going with the flow. And everybody is getting plowed. The voices and the music and the noise is getting loud. You got a heavy buzz on when seven o'clock rolls around. So you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown. Only nineteen but you know where you can get it. So you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting. By about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead. You really can't remember who was the one that said. Let's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck. He's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me up. Ten minutes later the whole vibe had changed. You try for conversation. But you know you're acting strange. Your eyes are wide open but your smile is gone. You just keep fiending 'til the fucking break of dawn. Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver. A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver. While I doze I suppose.
first dimension,"Blow you right out of the room. Ringing ears like sonic boom. Miles wide you hear me calling, calling. Across the ocean cross the sea. Navigating disparity. Miles wide you hear me calling calling. Now it? s time that we mention. A further extension. Reality is our intention. It? s like meditation. Beyond medication. And striving for the transformation. Quantum leaping through science. To cosmic compliance. By ending our fossil reliance. Now the miscalculations. Are causing mutations. Here? s your correction, boom!. It? s something beyond comprehension. We come from another dimension. It is our one true intention. To change your fate yes I? m telling you. Beings that once were cetacean. Resonating through earth? s vibration. Want you to solve the equation. Before it? s too late c? mon!. Power without control. Dig yourself into a hole. Rocketing on the horizon rising. Philosophy expressed to me. Moments spending silently. Listening to the horizon rising. The nuclei dividing before my eyes. I wonder why how can this be at all. Imagine a time. Before words made a rhyme. Before clocks to wind. Before they had the chance to stall. Across the ocean across the sea. Navigating disparity"
first straw,Oh a whole new way of looking at things. The way you react to phone rings. The way it feels when you just let it flow. Sometimes I wonder just how it could be. You take every bit before we see it off the rails. I think that you should know. You never cease to amaze me. You keep me from going crazy. And that's one thing I know for sure. Sometimes I see just how it all will be. Take every bit it's so easy the first straw. And this I know for sure. (Chorus). The first straw. So small it seemed impossible. The next straw. Vanished like shooting stars that fall. The last straw. There's no reason for getting there at all. Yeah. No reason to take it there at all. Yeah. The last straw can land in your mix. Your best day could be apocalypse. Nobody pay attention to the first straw. It seems the last one is all we ever saw. The first straw's a metaphore I pick up myself. It tells me something by showing me something else. I think that you should know. Chorus. No reason to take it there at all. Yeah. Everyone reacts when it gets to the weight of breaking their back. I won't let that be us cause the long side never gave back. Yeah. Chorus x2
five of everything,"No matter what I try there's no room in my mind. No way to go round that, that's just the way it is must I remind. I don't pick up the phone but you still try to call. There's nothing left to say. You've already gotta know we've said it all. The story never ends, in search of something. But once we arrive it all starts again. Reaching for higher ground, the river's rising. It keeps on flowing forever no matter what we have found. Sometimes it seems insane. To just keep pressing on. As if it will put out the flame. But still the thirst remains. Drink another drink. And somehow I still feel the same. Step off, head out, take flight, and just run. Got five of everything but I just need one. My brain telling me what I want, I need. Got five of everything but I still proceed. Help me fill up this hole. It's gaping and out of control. It feels like I'm losing touch and it's taking its toll. When this wall isn't moving. State of things not improving. And no satisfaction in the distraction of the day. Sometimes it seems insane. To just keep pressing on. As if it will put out the flame. But still the thirst remains. Drink another drink. And somehow I still feel the same. Step off, head out, take flight, and just run. Got five of everything but I just need one. My brain telling me what I want, I need. Got five of everything but I still proceed. Living in this culture can be a drag. It's just a commercial what we have. A one track mind we grab, grab, grab. We're past being crazy, call us mad. Gone is the golden egg and the goose. And the bullshit of all hell breaking loose. We gotta hit the boost. Sip on the thick juice. Disregard the bad cards. And wake the truth. Step off, head out, take flight, and just run. Got five of everything but I just need one. My brain telling me what I want, I need. Got five of everything but I still proceed. The story never ends, in search of something. But once we arrive it all starts again. Reaching for higher ground, the river's rising. It keeps on flowing forever"
flowing,"Along the way to close my eyes. I lost where I was going. the more it will spin. the more that I try. to stop my mind flowing away, away. to all that I despise. along the way to close my eyes. You can't be let down if you don't expect the world. expect to lay awake and by your sleeping girl. if somebody cares then there is no way you can tell. cursed consciousness is your private hell. Along the way to close my eyes. I lost where I was going. the more it will spin. the more that I try. to stop my mind flowing away, away. to all that I despise. along the way to close my eyes. Tick, tick, tick the clock bludgeons your mind. endlessly replaying times that were unkind. go away sun I'm not prepared for you today. it seems you are, it seems you are, huh!. Along the way to close my eyes. I lost where I was going. the more it will spin. the more that I try. to stop my mind flowing away, away. to all that I despise. along the way to close my eyes."
freak out,"Let the games begin if you wanna fuck with me. You can't disturb the course of P & C & T & D & me. I'm on a mission. To set straight. The vice, the curse, the date, the gate relate. to this. I insist B it's weak to dis see I'm runna up so suckers stick to your 40. How could I give a damn, give a damn if you approve what it's about. I just freak out. Just guess ya'll c'mon come back slipped outta whack as the master. Laid out the music. Death I just say fuck you, the void unknown we're thrown through while lost in life's psychedelic trip we take. There's another more bizarre we have to make. world we have nowhere beyond. Take out the earth the bass is gone. At life's end we'll feel the calm. How strange we should be here at all. Chorus:. If you don't have someone to do it with it's not worth doin'. To all my friends, it's not the end the earth has not swallowed me yet. Into whose womb were you woven what kin of your skin dropped you then. Bodies cloven. Light of daybreak blinded next exit. The wild darkness forming inside it. My day wasn't promised me each death it brings reminding me we. Are rumbling through this cursed universe where death is birth. Think not but what your manifest is worth. Giving up a verse the curse occurs a thirst. To burst first breaking through the center of the universe. Slamming down on the lingo flow so jam to the bumrush single. Long ago has been become now when you find out there's no break. In the rhythm. Black anima makes my stamina stand alone disown the cinema farewell to posing decades dozing comin up the steps of the new. Screen rising scenes from the lost world shapes hard to tell. Which is which as if drawn by a child holmes. Chorus. This is the heat to flush your face."
freeze time,"I'd like to stay here just like this. It's just a momentary bliss. That's all we can hope for. That's a reason to cope for. This life, this life and no more. (SA Chorus). You will be immortal man. One in the hand. You will know exactly then. What you have. You found the cure. And Morse codes for rapture. Get with your rhythm. Get with your nature. The momen't running down a mountain. It can be captured from a fountain. Sometimes all that it can be. Absence of agony. Pleasure from the lack of pain. (SA Chorus). Serendipitous my travels throughtout time. I graba moment like a thief and then I make. it mine. Nothing will compare to you realization. When you come to find out your new objet of. fixation. (Nick Chorus). I try to freeze time try to freeze time for your mind. Perfect snapshot to always rewind. Golden buttered jam golden buttered jam for. you slam. Remember it in your synapse diagram. Sweetness is you bein'. Zen human walkin'. Steppin' out from shadows. Flowin' like a breeze soft and. When dawn unveils the morin star risen. Feel the life feel the love your christened. With this life not ours not for long. But for the taking take it. The birth light breaking break it. Between the light and dark is a seen. That is caving in. Mutating rearranging your soul. Changing form again. (SA Chorus). Srendipitous my travels throughout time. I grab a moment like a theif and then I make. it mine. Nothing will compare to you realization. When you come to find out you new object of. fixation. (Nick Chorus). (SA Chorus)."
friday afternoon,"Friday afternoon and all the worries just float into the air. We? re going to our secret spot and no one else knows how to get there. The words just poured out of you like a melody. I just could not believe the things you? re telling me. Come closer, come closer. Nothing could be half so compelling. As you and me, our senses telling us where to go. You give me quite a show. We? re stretched out horizontal throttle down. Upon the ground and always taking it slow. Here we go. I taste the salt on your skin and then it? s really beginning. I got the message you? re sending. Go again and again? til we? re spent. I hear somebody coming. Maybe a year went by. Could be two lifetimes. But I know it? s building up again"
frolic room,"Yeah. There's a gravity in me. Pulling me to want to see. What is going on tonight. Beneath the electric starlight. I like to mix with walks of life. Who live life on the other side. Pulling mussels from their shell. A place to some that looks like hell. Oh. A classic song that the jukebox has on has me moving. Oh. The faces here make it so surreal. Oh, in the company of pretty girls and new vagrants. One drink away from sleeping on the pavement. I'm not quite sure what I find so appealing. About the happy hour stealing. A party, after party. Til' it started to get grainy. Another, and another. What are we celebrating. There's always something not to miss. Diving back in the abyss. And it gets so very stale. But tomorrow's a new tale. In the Frolic Room. Woah. The seat I assume. Yeah. And I'm drawn to the night. And its damn neon light. Yeah. Where are we meeting up at. Let me guess bet I know. Does it have a sign in the window. Ice cold six packs to go. Sleep it up if you have to. There's a booth always in shadow. The reality is all around you. It's the best reality show. Oh, in the company of the privileged and the nearly damned. Mixing like a cocktail of your spirit slam. In the danger zone is where you'll find me. In a certain dive so inviting. A party, after party. Til' it started to get grainy. Another, and another. What are we celebrating. There's always something not to miss. Diving back in the abyss. And it gets so very stale. But tomorrow's a new tale. In the Frolic Room. Woah. The seat I assume. Yeah. And I'm drawn to the night. And its damn neon light. Yeah"
from chaos,"Chorus:. From chaos comes clarity, I tell ya. What you appear to be, you ought to know. Glycerin tears don't fool me, I tell ya. Delusions plaguing everybody. Makin that hybrid music back in '90 now it's on ya. I hear we were the model for the band you front we spawned ya. Finding it hard to come original we warned ya. We're shakin the white boys in New York, black girls in California. We come through hip-hop drum-n-bass and dancehall rhythms. You want our beats and lyrics you want to get them. Watchin you sink into the depths of opportunism. Missing the point, music's about love not pessimism. I'm SA moving supreme and on my team. I rock the mic with a sweet lean. And you know that started as a fact the only DJ MC gettin down like that. Metaphorically we are the chief of police you're rock n' roll. And we're positive you stole more than just the radio. Now it's 21 and we are back in control. The jammies are coming, people succumbing cuz we got the soul. Bridge:. Everyone tends to forget upon re-entry. Orbiting space quantum saints we're the only. Beginning from a planet so naturally. Gifted in the heart lies our technology. It's only right, right. Entering in a space of pure delight, light. Next contestant on this jam is, tight. Feels spontaneous you'll improvise, vise. (Chorus). Don't even try it, you don't want to disrespect me. If dealing with punks was school, I'd have a Harvard degree. You can't make me hate you no matter how punk you act. No matter what you do I don't react. I'm a perfect example of not giving a f--k. About the catty rude people that just suck. What do you know all of the sudden, ah I usurp you. Look it up in the dictionary to find out what I do. I go back to the style I came from. It's not something you can fake son. You're a con man who's run is done. You lead a world wide web of deception. (Bridge). (Chorus)."

Just fuck the has been's and their stupid ass rambling. promises it's bullshit they can't come through with. do it in the basement no complacence. it's time to kick the fuck in, begin to win no sin and then. share it, declare it in the public domain refrain. perfectly sad if it was about. but it's not so I'd frown then I'd give it a shot. super dumb lyrics make you think I'm a clown.

full ride,"Awww s--t, what. You know the freaks can't handle it. We keep on searching from the seaside to the mountainside come on. Hardly out styled and hardly outblazened. Nectar natural completely amazing. Others more concerned with just fronting on hardness. I flow sweet with millennium niceness. I don't know if they're just scared or what. But a little sincerity would knock them on their butt. I keep my dogs at my side and keep my s--t tight. Let me tell you how I feel, all right. Y'alls radio rock ain't tuff. Can't move to that ain't deep enough. One more time groove on the line. Chills up my spine, ready rewind. Chorus:. The only thing that never gets old is honesty. You'll probably be caught up fronting. The only thing you always try to be is hard. Because you're scared that someone might pull your card. The only thing that never gets played out. Is melody I'm hearing it calling me. It's plain to see because it's all laid out. Full ride I'm a master of technology. Livin my life nice in pursuit of groove-ology. I'm getting vibes like you checking me out. Without a doubt I pull clout and crush crews in a rout. I'm a Doberman in any given reaction. Well-mannered and reserved yet ready for action. I let you have it all I got nothin to hide. Let me tell you how we comin we comin full ride. Full ride, full ride we work it on the inside. As you'd expect we come correct. While others just run and hide. Full ride, full ride we work it on the inside. As you'd expect we come correct. I get the f--k up rockin the jams. I bump disco, playin records all day I then let go. I'm the king of my town but when my girl is around parlay like the Count of Monte Cristo. So simple the jams are in front of me. Get drunk in New York make fun of me. When we play it's a serious things to all the people who gather. Here's what we bring. (Chorus). Full ride, full ride we work it on the inside. As you'd expect we come correct. While others just run and hide. Full ride, full ride we work it on the inside. As you'd expect we come correct."
galaxy,"Between Mars and Jupiter there's a gap. For another planet now way back yeah. Maybe a mad man just blew the shit out of it. Now were tryin' to get back in alignment. Explains why we go through cycles. Always tryin' to find it. Closin' into the age of Aquarius. Crazy weather floods tornadoes. Low jet streams not gettin' better. Enterin' a twilight zone. Activities grown every single day. More people spottin' UFO's. Let's come together with this new coast shit. We got the motherfuckin' kids now lets freak this shit. It's messed up when you're feeling everything is wrong. Takeover the Pentagon. It's fucked up in this paradigm. Cuz I'm burning fossil fuels I don't even need to. Free energy has been harnessed. We don't use it why. Cuz the techniques been suppressed. The hour glass has passed through granules. That's cool we gotta break it. Bust all these rules and switch. Change up the pitch. Rearrange our lives and this dumb shit we'll ditch. Let's come together with this new coast shit. We got the motherfuckin' kids now lets freak this shit. It's messed up when you're feeling everything is wrong. Dealin' in our Chevrons. I found a bootleg of the cosmic conscious then erased it. Visualized the breath technique slowly became it. Now something is watchin' me. Since I have found the keys. To free this energy. My high speed light body. Cuz the galaxy is crazy. It doesn't amaze me that we're livin' out of phase. And quickly decaying. 6 protons, 6 neutrons, 6 electrons. Is encoded in the plane. We live on."

get down,"I got this great idea about why I got in reverse. I was so out of control it just got worse. I hope you got more sense than I, side step the curse. I don't know which came first. In the spiral threatening my survival. It's come, time to get down. It's time to get down. Boots to the ground. Know we don't stop 'til they hear the bell sound. Keep your head up. Cause the truth just cut. No quick fix when I'm caught in a rut. What I got to do to get right size. Think I'm despised when I look through the eyes. Of another. Not mine to discover. What the next man think is none of my fucking business. And then I say what is this. Illusion I can't fix it. You name it, hey. The story stays the same. Any trouble you can name. Just goes straight into accepted. You name it, hey. It's time to get down. To the ground. So simple yet profound. In the now. Is why we're here. Inspiration. I've been waiting all my life. I'm set free, it's happened. I won't look back and think twice. It's how it's meant to be. Something's happened. A sudden slap in the right place. In my face, I thank you. You always came through for me. It's how it's meant to be. Gonna get down because I can't stay high. All of the time, cause I see the sign. So I re-align with an open mind. Adamant and circumvent. I get by every night and day. Get by with my comfort way. An Open space to an open way. I just unwind, I just unwind. And then I say what is this. Illusion I can't fix it. You name it, hey.

grassroots,I flip when I kick it trippin it. So I can check shit not in a daily style. But once in every while so I can. File check file check the files of my brain. Many of meaning manage to come from the insane. And the butcher the baker the fabulous drama maker. A cracker on a truck goin' breaker breaker. Listen to everyone then disregard it. The maningful shit comes back back to where it started. In your cranium surrounded by pot like a geranuim. A capital 2 burns in my mind give me some peace. I looked at her I looked at him and neither one did know. Where the wild thoughts grow check it out. I look for absolutes and there absolutely none. The truth is what you shoot for not one. Nothing brings it all together the journeys never done. I'd sing you Stormy Weather but it's been sung so. Let's have some fun. Three Eleven hass grass roots. Challenge comes and goes and there will be another. I say bring it on. The roots that grow underground are as big as the tree. That you see if not it will fall down. We waste so many moments standing on convention. The only survey is when our heart pays no attention. Move with persistence cover much distance. Knowing no perdition that's my game for instance. Three Eleven true to no tradition. And the Three Eleven crew not dow with convention. But a hundred different people already told what we about. So I make not attempt to try and suss the stupid out. I'd turned into a roughneck that was not my intention. It doesn't even really matter unless I fail to mention that. Peace to all crews that want some peace. First the Mid then the West then we slide through the East. A piece to any crew that want a peice. But peace to all crews that want peace. Check it out.
guns (are for pussies),"Here comes the thunder down under. We're natural wonders. Night falls when we leave all you feel is the hunger. Suprises people of all shapes and sizes. Dig on the decade and realize it's all funkay. No matter this rude boy still got that swagger. My ears have heard all these crews but we're badder. Interracial, special, positive beings. I am i be a cool awakening. It's gettin hectic the metrics the body electric. Everybody in worn out blue jeans or tacky dresses. This is the city we've reached we've come to. Go unrecognized on the corner or make moves. All the lights are red all the poets dead. A familiar nightmare appears in my head. Times are changin' myself i'm rearrangin'. Dream eight-thousand-five-twelve blazin'. Born to act out, born to act out. Paranoid with a gat. Born to act out, born to act out. Think you know where it's at. Born to act out, born to act out. But you're lookin' like a sissie. Born to act out, born to act out. Guns are for pussies. I'm not from philly but some say i'm blunt. That's just the way i am and i'm not going to front. And yes i took a trip to find out about the ways of big. City seedy bars and drugs that make you feel shitty. Pretty older women in skirts conversation frisky. Stinking cigarettes and plenty of bourbon whiskey. Sad classic music on the jukebox of doom. Hollywood blvd. barfly frolic room. Tomb of lost souls some beyond salvage. Some just having fun opening steam valvage. I was one becoming the other hellbent to discover. Had to pull up the reigns or else smother. Take it brother all the way and then you're scared. Don't want to be unprepared. You're getting paranoid. And then guns are shared. You guys think that you're hard. But you're in fear of being harmed. I fear no man and i'm unarmed. Born to act out, born to act out. Paranoid with a gat. Born to act out, born to act out. Think you know where it's at. Born to act out, born to act out. But you're lookin' like a sissie. Born to act out, born to act out. Guns are for pussies."

Do what you got to on the dance flor>. Some say the style is wack but I say fuck that. Get the hell back and watch us rock the set. We cast the mold bust it cold explode. Megatrendsetters known around the globe. Friends takin' you where you never been. We done what we wanted craftin' poems. You can rock there is a glow around you. Lose control holmes just like we do. Hard to obtain brotha' what's my name. Mad to find unlike ya mamma and your masquerade. I drive a mach-1 no dashboard Jesus. I hear voices say that's Doug Martinez. You're all up in my mix like fuckin' betty crocker. You think you're playing me but actually you're a jocker. You bad mouth me bitch man you givin me juice. It aint nothin' but a party everybody get loose. Notice what I don't do when stress steps to me. Whatever your complaint so sue me. I say fuck the naysayers and keep goin. Gotta do what I gotta do to get the people glowin'. So let everybody gather the more the better. I represent the traveler him he's a shredder. At ease with yourself and don't try to please me. I'm just here today then quickly I'm out. On the town one light I'm a glow worm. For several hours wiggle jiggle like I'm a huge sperm. Can't appreciate a brothers love of funky music. You think I'm a silly rabbit 'cuz my style has tricks. Of the way I feel now I just got to rock. The music be poppin through me like electric shocks. I think and blink and I wink but that shits not tiny. 'Cuz in a blink of an eyelash you will not find me. You're the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack. That's what you get when you're steady talkin' shit. Not goin' for self that shit is on the shelf. 'Cuz it's 95 and we go for the hive. ."

hostile apostle,"I can't free myself of the suspicion. For your motives on your mission. Some people live for the rules, I live for exceptions. Can't take part in the deception. But I know just how it feels, to wanna blow the world away. Just to get to what is real, it won't work cuz. Everybody grinds to a hlat now and then. Everybody's game gets salt then again. No matter what the papers say they're normal as they come. Bodyguards, ball of wax, they hide behind the gun. They get a panic pulse when they are so far from home. To me that is the reason to continue to roam. Exhilaration mix with the people skunk blazing. Checking out the shows that are sadly unamazing. Chorus:. Hostile Apostle who you following. Negative energy that you're swallowing. Some coked out mal-content, who's soul is up for rent. Victim of lost soul Hostile Apostle. Unlimited in time and space and nearest universal. Light is what we're reachin for it's not rehearsal. Follow this around follow this hustle. Makin use of everything movin all your muscle. Angry human leads impressionable boy. To skulls and piercings I will destroy. All of your heroes speak nothing to me. One emotion one tempo and no real feeling. In this field we are the presence of the thoughts you're missin. Keepin positive's intact from all the people dissin. Open your eyes look at who you're kissin. If you can't hear it, people just listen. (Chorus). Angry human leads impressionable boy. To skulls and piercings I will destroy. All of your heroes speak nothing to me. You don't have to be a prick just to be heavy. Changin all the time we changin all the same. Change in this life and this eternal frame. Warm in the sun refresh in the breeze. Glow in the stars blossom in the trees. Livin through life in infinite extent. Spread undivided operate unspent. No high, no low no great and no small. Build and bound connect and equal all."
how do you feel?,I'm all right I feel real light. I don't live a life that's uptight. Where there's fight there's struggling. I can't walk through the world. Without offering questions. What's my direction. Breakin' the grip of depression. There comes a day when you let THINGS go. There comes a time to rock a show. You know the time that you feel. THAT nothing else really matters. You're on the spot in the world. AND you belong. That's where I am when the lights going down. I'll find a way to make some fun. I know that there is a link of energy. To someone. How do you feel?. Cuz I couldn't ask for. A single thing more. How do you feel?. The moment you know. Just what you are for. I'm on a quest with a vision. I've got love and tradition. I wear a mask that grins and laughs. I remember what I've done. I'm a vibe under the sun. I penetrate all dimensions. I've come again. Rejuvenate within. I'm future animation. I feel the fuel rushing through my veins. It's a burning flame. You could take on the world. It's all in your brain. How do you feel?. Cuz I couldn't ask for. A single thing more. How do you feel?.

i told myself,"Picked up on the wrong scent. Not gonna make a dent. How many times are you in my rhymes. Burn me once shame on thee. But burn me again shame on me. I'm chasing and facing the point misplacing. When I think of you my mind's racing. I'm spacing out when I get to the point of no return. I get burned, I told myself I'm through with you. The last thing that I'll ever do. Let down my guard shouldn't be too hard. I know it's over got to elevate, disregard. Chorus:. I can't believe I fell for it, but did it again. I told myself I'm gonna quit, but did it again. I can't believe I fell for it, but did it again. I told myself I'm gonna quit, but did it again. This was supposed to be the last time. I told myself, this wouldn't happen again. I told myself I wasn't ever going to call you. I told myself I wouldn't let you back in. But here I am dialing, trying. I told myself to get a hold of myself. I won't freak out, let you tweak out on ecstacy not next to me. Somethin tells me baby girl that you're testin me. I told myself to get ahold of myself and I'm tryin, I'm not lyin. Don't make me mad, you know I love you bad. I want to sniff the glue that holds me to you. I told myself to get a hold of myself. But don't rush me, can't you trust me. The sound I hear whenever you are near. I know it's never wrong and it's my favorite song. (Chorus). And now it's all turned bad, turned bad, turned bad. Your ploy to make me jealous is obvious and sad. It has the opposite effect. Now you're left with what you had, you had. The rain comes down as love turns to dust. I was joking she took me serious. The rain comes down as love turns to dust. I was joking she took me serious, yes serious. This was the last time that I was ever going to call. I told myself, I wouldn't let you back in. But here I am dialing, tryin."
i'll be here awhile,"I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while. Far is solace in the maddening pace. sad state written on my face. not a tight rope walk but dance. uncertain game of chance. but I'll see it through in time. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while. And if a person place or thing can deliver. I will quiver with delight. tempted by the hand that could. blind my vision and sight. but at twenty years of age. in frolic and in rage. I will see it through in time. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. I'll be here a while. But the dawn has come into the endless night. and everything's going to be alright. but at thirty years of age. through frolic and in rage. all regressed and healed in time. I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere. Said I, said I, said I, I will survive."
independence day,"Just throw away your material possessions. And sing the praises of life. This trip has taught me a valuable lesson. The future brings clarity and vision and sign. It was independence day. Ive seen the other side and I say. Oh, Ive been insane. And I will never be the same. A mountain brings me space. The vine brings me time. Wind brings me change. Unity with the mind. It was independence day. Ive seen the other side and I say. Oh, Ive been insane. And I wont never been same. As the raw son sins in glamour. And his greedy and violent rage. Stimulate and torment assailants. Peace is dead. Uneasy moment as the first warrior stirs. Reveal your denial brings scheming to return. The battle begins as the first victim. Slowly, grudgingly. Submits to the captivity of consciousness. And I say. It was independence day."

To consume that product to its very end. How much time is left will you collapse will you confess. You're in that spiritless void spinning into excess. You blacked out on the floor you told me. The next day they found you that way. Those damn medications had your back baby. It hurt when they took them all away. You're feeling so bad. You're looking for a place to land. Help me understand. How in hell it got so out of hand"

long for the flowers,"Between this world and the next. I want to locate a bit of you. Will I feel it. Or gaze an emptiness. Who guessed it could be so unfinished. A never-ending infernal cross. Yes yeah where is that bliss. The ordinary life I knew that was so exquisite.. You long for the flowers. I get more from the hours spent. Man instead of free of descent. A day without argument. You said you long for the flowers. That you remember. A song sang from the shower. How I used to bend words. You ask me where did all that go. And I have no answer. I admit that I'm giving up hope. And wandering if it can survive. One day will we just begin again. One day. Will we begin again. You said you long for the flowers. That you remember. A song sang from the shower. How I used to bend words. You ask me where did all that go. And I have no answer. I admit that I'm giving up hope. And wandering if it can survive. Don't think I take lightly. The one thing we feel. I wish we're surviving. The time, the time. It steals like a thief. Woah, Something to take lightly. The one thing we feel. I wish we're surviving. The time, the time. It steals like a thief"

lucky,"I'm takin' to the bridge and there's a different country. I'm bringing with me the people I know deep down are funky. Oh yeah we dap we got the juice it's on tap. Never take the itme to rewind all the weak crap. Here take it it's yours the gift is calling. The sunshine be falling our way first every morning. I'ma magician you see I'm christened with condition. Held over from a future would I've come to you so listen. There's a place out in deep space. Where all the brothers chant and dance and rant. And shave their heads like Buddha. I'm a fly guy you know I'm smoother. Of course no remorese is felt for all those loser crews. I do not care what you do, I always screw up. But when I do it's nothing like you, I wish you grew up. You're saying anything like promist to get clean. Won't kick half dead fucked up in the head. Just get him out of here he's making me sick. We push a sucker out. With much force and much clout. Didn't want to do it. Thats not what were about. But we got to have a limit. How low can you get it. Seems about time to. Change the subject. And sing about the wise eyed. That makes me feel. Good and never do. I leave misunderstood. Damn you know I feel good true. I got a choice of what I'm gonna do It's like this that. Swingin on my bat. Mix a melody with some back chat. Tell 'em again. Dam I know you feel good too. You got a choice of what you're gonna do it's like this that. Nippin' on a cat. Mix a melody with some back chat. I'm rollin' slow no particular place to go so nothings changed. The more things stay the same the more it doesn't matter. To a latte day St. Bernard acting hard. But I throw down like a crazy retard. But what cold make a man. Wanna walk around the school yard with his tool hard. What could make the switch to call a woman a bitch. It probably downed when you couldn't get a date to the prom. And you were stuck with Beavis. Let's leave us on a note of positivity. I'm saying this for levity. But if I leave it brief I call it brevity. I said I see the people rocking. Which means there's no stopping the flow. And you can just tell 'em that you know. Every night yeah we turning up. And comin' off live. Like and final 311 battle breakin idols. On the one you never heard before. You know the hardcore rockin. Pumping the dance floor. Leave ya feet sore lookin for your Micatin. Cecause the mic is deadly int he mood we in. Certified not fakin coool like a Jamaican. Every time the enemy hear us they will be shakin'. ."
made in the shade,Sitting by the bedroom window. Looking at a slideshow on a Sunday but it? s Monday. Well how would I know I? d be looking out the same old window. Years later on a Monday thinking something would come from doing the same thing. Bout time to give up on the same old stuff I? m stuck on. Just say that it went wrong and move it along. Sayonara till tomorrow it? s just how it goes sometimes. You gotta keep on climbing the hill. Cuz if you think you? ll make it you will. Go swimming quick like a fish and every wish will be fulfilled. Strike up and start the parade. Cutting down the weeds keep slinging the blade. When they fire that warning shot. You? ll have a spot made in the shade. Standing at a side street station. Feeling like a one way on the down low. Flying solo till further delay. Easy blame it on procrastination. Always hoping somehow that the nonsense this time will make sense. Stuck in circles. Faces in the sunshine they never look at mine. People just walk by and keep their eyes low. Sayonara till tomorrow. That? s how it goes sometimes
make it rough,"Never thought it would come easy. Slow as turning soil. That? s the only way to reach me that much I am sure of. Bring it to a boil. Just take your time, thoroughly. Let the seasons be the air you. Breathe in and out. Patiently. Wait for spring? s returning. Try not to think too far ahead. The pendulum swings soon enough. We could stay on this side instead. But we wanna make it rough. There were times I thought I? d get there. I know you thought so too. The days have bled together. Now anyway will do. If you? re looking I might have it. But you have to look to see. The image you have of me. Is what I? d like to be. I was so good at pretending. And denying when things bothered me. So shut the front door I? ll. Kick in the back. Metaphorically, I? m hoping. Try not to think too far ahead. The pendulum swings soon enough. We could stay on this side instead. But we wanna make it rough. Make it rough? til they put you in the handcuff. Seeking out minds that are not yet corrupt. Woi-oh woi-oh and away you go. I? m a go on til the god damn juice gone. Far enough into the journey to feel the satisfaction yes. Action speaking louder than bombs. We just go on and on, on and on, on and on and on. Try not to think too far ahead. The pendulum swings soon enough. We could stay on this side instead. But we wanna make it rough"

Yo my daddy told me, ""Hey son you must act chill"". Alien rough. My galaxy is tough. Here comes the bang of a hip-hop thang that we bring and swing. Men from Mars aint ever gonna hang. With dope Buddha's come to the stage we are attackin. Space assassin naked live and never slackin. Come a day on the way enter on S.A.. Amplified form another world far away. I got the pang of a gang and I come from the Southside. Here's the thang that I bring and I promise to come live. While the masses passes upon there fucking asses. And if you don't see get glasses. That is a shot out to the words of Curt Grubb. The motherfucker is not scrub I said the man is the kind. With the one that I call Brine Shrimp. We nover ever do skimp I limp on a stage in a huff. Like magic dragon I puff on the stuff of a Humbolt cone. Then I'm stonded watch out. Smoke the weed that come from Northern California. Don't do no cocaine that come from Columbia. That the thing that mash up your nature. Mash up your body and mash up your culture. Take a tip from the the flipped script of Daddy Freddy. I give complete props to the one that rocks steady. With dexterity and goes on and on and on. And turn out the dope shit like the one that's called. Pawn Shop Press yes it's on what's up. P-Nut change it up. ."
offbeat bare-ass,"Any different people can apply to drop the funk. It's not a country club review board steady talkin junk. Many people would have it others go put and grab it. Some trip over toots and say fuck it I'm sunk. I put it in a limerick and kick the slick nick verbs. I am the one who scores the herb. When we're on the road P-Nut rolls it up. Throw me a joint on stage what's up. I will tell a cop that I know my fucking rights. And we can match wits all night for real. He said if I had nothing to hide. Then of course I wouldn't mind if he looked through our ride. Uh, no I'd really rather you didn't. And no we don't have guns hidden. We stood there for a while continue to decline. Firmly, I didn't lose my mind. I didn't let him break me he's just another human. Not a bit of shame in what we were doin' that day. He couldn't make us stay. We had our shit together. It don't matter whether. We sport the dread locks or a shaved head. Or if we have a sticker from the dead. I said a better verse rehearsed about the roughneck curse. Last week I keep an even keel and bow in place. And face the music every minute. Never could see my homey comin' till he passed. Funky gas by my way all the day I couldn't laugh. Oh by now I'm chill with it. Bare ass in my face I'm ok but Chad's like ""Uh-uh no he isn't"". So I proceed to hear him get loose with the. Fartin' all over my face sometimes my tummy. He fucked with my flow although I thought it funny. I probably wouldn't care if I smoked more kind bud. But that wouldn't do me shit cuz then he'd fuck me more up. Crazy ill and chillin' rude but I'ze a real cool dude. He didn't believe the day would come when he would get his top. But then one day right in front of his face I got him. He looked over said ""God damn get me some water"". The one time I hadn't wasted till I got mine. Smeared his nose with my armpit funk slime. So you get it the picture just how sick we were then. But before I jet ""Hey yo Chad sniff my finger man"". I can see a lot of people who feel like I do. I can see a lot of people who feel like I don't. I go on step lightly even when I'm heavy. High jump the slump open up fot eh Revy Horton Heat. Sweet what am I displayin' forgot what I was saying. I know I must be laying a pipe you got a gripe. With the way I get high. Graffix bong sing along with a cry of a. Mandatory sentence for a crime with no victim. When everyone knows jail terms should be picked in. Order of the pain that they cause. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. Until you violate the rights of another. Respect the space of your sister and your brother. The war on drugs may be well intentioned. But it falls fucking flat when you stop and mention. The overcrowded prisons where a rapists gets paroled. To make room for a dude who has sold. A pound of weed to me that's a crime. Here's to good people doin time y'all. Bare Ass Yeah x4."
omaha stylee,In a minute everything you have can all be straight gone. In a minute things you though were tied can come straight undone. How about some knocks on wood some so far it's so good any day. What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out. To the north and south that's what plates are about. Nature has no conscience no kindness or ill will. The dreams they had make me sad because of the vides of them. When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened. To me and my family my bro's and I were driving. The RV bleeding flames us leaping through fire surviving. Zoned with no home there was fire all on it. Umm let me have my life I want it. I'm gonna let you know that I said. We're coming in kill we're coming chill. We've comin in how we will. Gone to tell the whole world what's the deal. And I say know no critical boarder cuz. We do what we want. Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font. Not one to get over sounding like the norm. Friendly to the radio all that shit is corn. All we coming with is a little bit of swing. And we go on like it ain't no thing. Omaha stylee did not think there was one. Where you know the radios weak and the shows are more fun. But you know we fuck up the dance since 1988. Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state. Still we're down like that x3. Makin the funk that smells of skunk. Such occasions occur back in the day. It begins you're a raw kid all the way. Son of a gun but they you drifted. All are endowed but few are gifted. At the break of dawn behaving like a spy. Lampin in the light the cold world awakens. Deeper is the light to open up the sky. Look into my eyes see the dialatin'. Omaha Stylee is the shit we come with man. Embedded in out souls it breathes out from this band We always knew. that we could. Thank you if you too felt we would. We will arise explore these worlds and find the grass roots. How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew. My dude on the one come off like Teflon. Rock your shit and you will rise on. If you're a farmer outstanding in your field say. Do as you eill do as you wish follow your bliss say. We travel round the world giving it our best. Like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest. The hammer and the chisel and the rule it compass. We forged the sword chariots of war our battle axe. There's much power in anger but loves a bigger banger. Complete props to my crew this is what we do.

outside,"Sunshine. Are you outside?. I am a simpleton by choice. not speaking to hear my voice. Sunshine. Why are you sleeping?. Gotta get outside. Cover the ground on foot. Not hitching around your spur. Over the river and trough the woods. I've come this far to bring in the goods. I get high, even when I don't try. Let 'em pass by with a wink to the eye. I reserve the right to be stoned. I reserve the right to take it to collect them sums I have the right. Don't try to be, there's really no point in you biting me. I'm glad to see that it's easy for me to be an MC. Let me tell you a little story. Like my dog Bobby, he hated the pool man. So I tried to play Kotter and make things cool. And I said just let him smell you, hold out your hand. He reached it on out, and then bam. He bit him, he bit him so fuckin' hard. Blood was steady gushin' all over my back yard. I kept apologizing, I felt so fuckin' bad. The dude was so cool, he didn't even get mad. He said man don't sweat it, that's the dog's meaning. Took some Neosporin and went back to his cleaning. Thought I had a dream or else it was a movie. Your mind can have a joint easy like jungle boogie. $600 freebie and I gots my job. Would you mind come but I gots my dog. Come you can foam the water with the bone. I wanna tell my mom, ring her on the phone. Cherry popsicle, icy, cold, freezing. Loves on his gums now that he is teething. Got a wee-wee pass, lay them by the door. Nasty Little shits he dropped them on the floor. Sunshine. Are you outside?. I am a simpleton by choice. Not speaking to hear my voice. Sunshine. Why are you sleeping?. Gotta get outside."
paradise,"Everything you do it comes back to you. Whatever it may be.. If it isn't one thing rest assured that something.. Will come back and pay you for your deed. A shortcut's a self defeating means, if you cannot do it clean.. You'll never reach your reward.. And when the day is done, what you receive is the sum.. Of what you took out, from what you put in.. Times deep in a dream seem a veiled realm.. Shadows what I think and feel is real.. Times in our tribe feel the tribe when we thrive.. We have no fear of death and no fear of life.. Chorus :. I can't forget you and our version of paradise.. I can't forget you and our version of paradise.. Everything you do it comes back to you, whatever it may be.. What you did as a devil or did as an angel.. The favor returns itself somehow.. If you take my money I’ll buy you a drink and you'll see.. That no one rides for free.. Afraid of what I said then your mind is stricken.. I'm wearing my heart sleeveless and I'm always up for kickin’.. This is my favorite city pity everywhere the enemy.. From the beginning serious history. nothing's ever given to no one. Rides for free.. From the beginning radiant energy's. music what I need to keep my sanity.. I say we fear no evolution stand up musical revolution.. Follow me now when I say we can never stop in we never give.. Cuz this is how we breathe and live.. Some of them whine and some of them bitch.. They cannot do it we never switch.. We do it for ourselves and we do it for you.. If you don't like it well I hope you do.. I've got to be honest.. Chorus.

This shall come to pass. The beginning of the end. Of the ignorance that once could sin. The tyrant to power. His day is done. In the worldwide revolution. Yeah, the peaceful revolution. All around this small world. Now the people demand to listen. These truths self-evident. Philosophical evolution. As the old die out. The young see a better way. Human rights guaranteed to all. Without regard to race, I say. The beginning of the end. Now the people vote, we will not sin. The tyrant to power. His day is done. In the worldwide revolution. In the peaceful revolution. I see the last frontier and the peaceful revolution. World peace is merely a product of social evolution. The conquest lies in accepting different peoples. And thinking right here at home. In the suns kingdom. The beginning of the end. And of the tolerance that once could sin. The tyrant to power. His day is done. In the worldwide revolution. In the peaceful revolution.

reconsider everything,"How many times will they do the same thing?. How did they get programmed to, your following?. Everyoneâ€™s locked up in their suffering. The only way you can tell is reconsider everything. What if the truth is that there is no truth. The only thing I can prove is there is no proof. Donâ€™t be so sure that your source is correct. People believed it before, before they had checked. How many times can they tell you. Til you just give them their way. How many times can sell you. Til you let them have their say. Every time you will ignore your. Heart it will come back twice more. Never deny your own instinct. Reconsider Everything. Everybody want something they control. Some just want grass some they want gold. Either way does it feel good or feel low. Taking you down not fast but real slow. Rebellion done for it's own sake. Does not a true free thinker make. To go against for it's own sake. You're still controlled by the course that the other man takes. Reconsider everything, reconsider everything. Reconsider everything, reconsider everything. Reconsider everything, reconsider everything. Reconsider everything."

revelation of the year,"We are not so different, you and I. No matter what we think. We? re kicking against the traces, bludgeoning. Trying to make it sink. We? re stepping into the unknown. Peeling layers of the onion right down. Cuz that is part of my style to. Risk to be left with nothing. In pursuit of chasing something. Out of hand. I know, I know don? t tell me. I? ve been on this earth. I know the moon like a friend. I hear a tune or someone sing. Feel the beauty in them. These words woman. We have some children. I got memories with you. I wonder how it ends. It? s beautiful yes. What we have chosen. With love in our hands. We have made this garden. & I think I can ride. Although I? m not a horseman. But I have a patient mind. & it? s open. We don? t want to walk into the gray. Solo rolling with no map in hand. So we reach out for someone to grasp. Keep from sinking into the sand. Pick it up now brother help another pick it up. Don? t get stuck in the destruction looming near. Pick it up now brother help another pick it up. This is the revelation of the year. Picking up all the pieces here and there. To see if one might fit. Spinning them around and sideways and up and down. It kinda stings a bit. Digging through all the ditches just unwinding all the stitches into thread. Then hang it out to dry so. What was I expecting just collecting balls of lint up in my head?. I know I know don? t yell at me. I know you? re tired of the same routine. You have that look on your face. I think I know what it means. Out of sorts in a vast machine. A worker bee up in the scene. Never will be the queen. & yes sometimes you have to sting. Expose the schemes to unlock the dreams. Ignite quicker than the gasoline. To mask everything again in a smokescreen. We don? t want to walk into the gray. Solo rolling with no map in hand. So we reach out for someone to grasp. Keep from sinking into the sand"

Expiate, to make amends for hostilities. It's easy to see that for me, in reality. I'm not one of those fools. With an ecclesiastical whitewash. To set my ethical standards. You'll never cathc me lookin' to Ann Landers. Or Moses or the law or even Buddha. If there's one thing I know. It's always be true to myself. And learn from experience. Educated by nights of violence, trips to jail,. Broken knuckles and friendships. But that gives me the power to write a groove that rips. Right Now. I Am."

salsa,We were born in the seventies. The rippin and rhyming and brethren see. We’re filling taste great. In the old school I was eight. Fot the new school I was late. But in high school I was debate. I rate in the great state of california. I’m warning ya. Je vais a la plage parce que le guignol est chouette!. I kick nonsense in french tasty like crepe suzette. I bet you gonna wanna try this but it takes niceness. I like a beat that’s unique and I like my head zooming. And in my continental you know that shit’s booming. With the diamond int eh back suicide doors. You can look from here to eternity. And never receive your morsel.. Another tale of ordinary madness. The girl who gave you her sex I heard was homeless say. All I really wanna is to feel nirvana. Won’t you take me tonight and we just might find. A bottle of wine and feel our nasty nature. Your toung lickin’ up my tounge. Your radio pickin’ up a smokey jazz love song. Madness becomes you even though your. Livin’ life it’s hard to exist when you’re tempted. By flesh you wanna bust through. Beautiful legs in the bar there is poetry. She bends and suspends and her ass. Is a marvelous thing. A dance dancin’ at a club the hereafter. Who can’t really dance but that doesn’t really matter. And she won’t hear applause. Cus your drunk and lost. All light is gone. Your arms spread like a cross. And you’re dreaming that the world. Will soon fall apart. Topless firl in your gaze. Which is hazy. Takes your dollar. In the gutter without cigarettes. Or wine your hungover. I was warned of your normal. Behaviour and felt. My life was too short to. Consider your wack self. It’s like this when you dip down. And you are boxin’. Reeling against the ropes and you. Face some young mexican. Your scrappin’ your kneck gets. Snapped back your eyes have bled. Your thinking’ about a comeback. But your takin’ it to the head. You little bastard. Better watch you back. Cuz we’re after. Your punk ass by God we’re gonna jack it. You’re played out and small time. And your show is over. You’re ’bout as lucky as a three leaf clover. And your older ho bag sceezer. In her droopy saggy skin. Who thoughtshe was a model. But in truth a never-has-been. I’ll slap that witch as if I were her pimp. And my crew will attest to her fradulence
same mistake twice,"These are the lyrics from the booklet. It's one thing to make the. Same mistake twice. Another thing to make it. All of your life. It's one thing to make the. Same mistake twice. Another thing to make it. All of your life. . The more you strengethen your denial. The more you turn to your desire. Na na na na. Appetite fight you'll beat it yet. Na na na na. By hook or by crook on that I would bet. Just hang on in there. . It's one thing to make the. Same mistake twice. Another thing to make it. All of your life. . Lost in a barrel of wine and whinning. Snared in a trap of your own designing. Don't be so sure. Nobody knows when it will end. Don't be so sure. Wouldn't I speak up if I'm a true friend. Just hang on in there. . It's one thing to make the. Same mistake twice. Another thing to make it. All of your life,. . your life. Another detail just goes by. Fallen into the abyss. That has become your life. . It's one thing to make the. Same mistake twice. Another thing to make it. All of your life. All of your life."
sand dollars,I? ve been humming a high note. Maybe something that I wrote. Out sailing in my boat. I? m not really sure. I? m still singing the same tune. I? ve been kicking around since June. All morning and afternoon. Now it? s all a blur. I? ve been listening to sea shells. To hear the stories that they tell. Of high times and tide swells. That have yet to occur. Backsliding down the drain. Partially taking all the blame. Chasing coins to fill the purse. Is it really better or for worse. Is it a blessing or a curse. To pass the buck. Is it a bounty or a bust. Is it precious metal or just rust. Well it seems it? s up to us. So wish us luck. I kept making a U-turn. Ended up with a sunburn. But the lesson that I learned. Was worth the skin that peeled. I climbed so many mountains. It? s not even worth counting. All the drinks in the fountain. Before it was revealed. From the copper to the kettle. The stamen to the petal. We watch the value of sand dollars crumble
seems uncertain,"It seems uncertain. I wish it was forgone. to know the version. that made life go wrong. Wish I had a clue. what rearranged our molecules. mostly wondering. it seems uncertain, ooh. it seems uncertain, yeah. it seems uncertain, ooh. uncertain. In times of trouble. everyone joins a team. no one waves a flag. for all human beings. No one's excited. unless they are divided. someone's going to have to give in. it seems uncertain, ooh. it seems uncertain, yeah. it seems uncertain, ooh. uncertain. I'd like to be. one of the faithful millions. but what I see. is an excuse for the killing. Your denomination. should be a private thing. how about a spirit. for all human beings. How could something well guided. turn out to be divisive. mostly wondering. it seems uncertain, yeah. it seems uncertain, yeah. it seems uncertain, ooh. uncertain"
sever,"Just sever that leash and release. your freedom of speech. you just have to believe. your deed will be received. somehow, somewhere. you won’t be repaid with a blank stare. let me know if you dare. There’s no one that could cure you. like she does (she does). no one could leave you so alone. (Cuh, cuh, come on). Here I goes, my vibe is holy, my eyes close. either I'm asleep or what I’m thinking is deep. eventually I sigh and then I kick the sheets. and try to piece together why I’m here. nothing except my own damn eyes and ears. and then it sever so I listen to my heart always and ever. if it’s not good it might get better. if it’s not good it might just sever. I tell you money there’s other honey. you always show it but you don’t know it. staring at the door thinking about the mess you’re in. in your couch sinking deep over the girl that's gone. Just sever that leash and release. your freedom of speech. you just have to believe. your deed will be received. somehow, somewhere. you won’t be repaid with a blank stare. let me know if you dare. Now all you think about her. drink about her in vain. but all else feels. like you’re betraying. We're wakin’ it up face up, and shakin’ it up. we know of an extended field. this is the deal. for letting and getting the vibes that we want. open up your heart. and proceed to feel. now you’re inchin' up. to the summit never plummet. boot your system up. and then bail with the middle finger up. why are you so abrupt, baby don’t be corrupt. Standin’ in the club playin’ the wall. but they’re not her is all. you think, and that is true. but what else can you do. trying to turn back time. or just tow the line. cause the space you’re in. is no place like home."
showdown,"So ya been kicked in the shin. Took one on the chin. Sometimes you lose before you win. Just smile in the meanwhile. At the bottom of the pile. Third down and a mile. Buckle up and try again. Keep pushin? keep pushin?. And never never stop. I feel that something? s gonna go down. Don? t say I didn? t warn ya. Looks like we? re headed for a showdown. Gonna get it on yeah. Champions soon will be named. Kings of the domain. All the pain and all the gain. Worth more than fortune and fame now. My oh my the stakes are high. Win or say goodbye.

When it? s all laid on the line. I can? t settle for less than. Everything that should be mine"
sick tight,"Head rush, C'mon we take the stage. And what's up it's on. This is a blowup so just listen up. Just take your mouth off interrupt. We came to throwdown, it's a showdown. And you know why we never lie. Get the lowdown son. We're mashin and bashin this stage we're crashin. If you're on the roof I know you're dancin. I bet we get the people jumpin overseas. And I know why you're bustin' mp3's. The s--t s--t shocker, the hip hop rocker. Wiser than Baraka, stronger than Chewbacca. KISS never did this nor Ozzy Osbourne. Shakin that ass and shakin your fistborn. Back to the future and past to the front. We appear like adrenaline it's just that blunt. Two score and five we came alive. A minor blowup was started. A song for the newly sane and the broken hearted. Head rush, C'mon we take the stage. And what's up it's on. From midnight til daylight. You best believe we're sick tight. You're cryin' bout your life, I think it is absurd. What could be so bad, you come from the suburbs. Just like me but I could never despair. Most people in this world ain't got s--t to spare. Suckas look up to thugs, they like the attitude. But f--k that, I'm talkin gratitude. The harder they act just to hide their insecurity. I'm talking honestly we are assuredly. Dope, I smoke it, but not every day. Cuz anything all the time's a drag I say. Three eleven you want to get next to them. The name's Nick H, E, X, U, M. Two score and five we came alive. A minor blowup was started. A song for the newly sane and the broken hearted. We keep an eye for each other then again. Our known associates endure. We make a sick tight connection when we see our true people on tour. Head rush, keep it going now. You know we get it right. We keep it flowing now. We're sick tight."
silver,"Don't fear mere words cuz if it takes a word ruin ya. You should have already hard you're finished through and soon ya. See that stifling sentences is so much more suspicious. Much worse could come of that so much more delicious. To the dastardly basturdly plans of little mice and men. Ugly rears its head and speaks from now and then. People love to disagree so avoid the endless bout make no attempt. To try and suss the stupid out. But of the racist institutions simple minds belong. Not happy just being human, no wish to get along. Little people need exclusions sucker groups to throng. It makes them feel special it makes them feel strong. Now I got a click but it's more like a family. Not an ethnic trip more like an ethic see. I write the rhyme today tell it to you later. Whether were coming in wack or what it's a waste to be a hater. Graffiti bombs-from the palms-love is so strong. Can't be stopped too long. For the night it will come. Shaped in the form of Mars that stone afar. Ghetto cool Oh well. Now you feel the spell. The color rocks the bell. The king of swing rise to the top. The thythm possessed in ya and it don't stop. The mise is broken The demon locin'. Dropping the bomb and all that is left is the smokin'. Cloakin' chokin; the lyrics are spoken. Infrared vision scopin' condition. Now breakin' 'em all to pieces like a sly rap bandit. Witha fly Lu-Kang kick in Mortal Combat and I land it. So get your own back when I jam it cold and. Hearing about you rhyme style been outmoded. The dopest flow upon the planet. Dope is the word the bro throw up on the down low goddammit. You juice your fucking friends like Dracula. But when we kick you out you're just brokula. You left a big surprise from Pacific Bell. Called all your relatives and your friends in Hell. Now let me tell you something you fucking piece of shit. You'll never have no money, now tell me was it worth it?. You leave a trail of lies that's why you keep moving. We won't come after you we'd only end up provin. In the end revenge send ends to the defendant. I know that statement's true I wear it like a pendant. I know you'll hear this song so I think it's funny. The name is theif or trust and money.. Like Captain Picard we come hard in light years. Our star has long bust but now reappears. In your sky at night rising and immense. Yes you see ourselves in the shine of it. And so passing under the dome of the great sky. Beware we are the stars holmes that you ruled by. Where death reborn into the world is a gift. So the future with no voice of its own will uplift. All is gone. All is calm y'all. Set wrecked in L.A.. In the Wetlands of New York. Atlanta and Phoenix. Portland, Lincoln and N.O.."
simple true,"Lying down on the pavement, so happy. Seeming to be in balance, but how could that be. Really I must be jealous, don? t tell me. I just gotta leave the broken pieces or it? ll be the death of me. Six long years and seven heartbreaks. Broken strings and countless outtakes, why?. Never thought that I would follow through. Got a working title somewhere. And I know one day I? ll get there, I? m. Grasping here. I? m looking out for a simple kind of true. Don? t know what I am waiting for. I? m holding out for a simple kind of true. At least some kind of a metaphor. It? s simple, simple and it? s true. We got much to do. No excuses they? re just useless. We? ve got much to do. I? d say you hung the moon if they ask me. You help me so the plot won? t get past me. Sometimes the obvious cannot be seen. At least not by me. Six long years and seven heartbreaks. Broken strings and countless outtakes, why?. Never thought that I would follow through. Got a working title somewhere. And I know one day I? ll get there, I? m. Grasping here. Remember all of the times. When we couldn? t make up our minds. Hours and years disappear"
six,"You know patience pushing a dream brings my demons to life. Songs are vacations our soul salvation will you. Suspend your disbelief I’d like to be the, thief. That steals that jaded necklace that you’re always wearing. I’d take that thing and with my knive I’d start pairing so. Chop chop piece piece and send it to the raiders of la. There are so many this land of plenty. The things we lack straight square within our grasp. Ever you do ever you think. Whether you’re brown or you’re pink. I think not thinkings better bout it. When you stop to think. The jaded ones will wither. While the optimistic grow. I settle that a bet will let a large amount. So indulge me just for a minute imagine no one holdin out. All trying for peace my brothers down. Some others down it happens slow. Think you should know the direction that the world go peace. They number six to make them feel like men. They one up us cuz we’re much to much for them. Ok the method to the mischeifs over there then. Sike shazam we strike with the lightnin. Through space we move and emit an ill tracer. We’re set to light your world kid we’re your maker. Check it our karma plus the avant garder. Style of out sect wise to ways comes to wreck. While the masses mill around curse in anguish. 311 stompin’ em down with the quickness. We see all the crews that be comin’ around. Like a drive through estes park you savor the sun. But when the clouds come make animals"
slinky,"I was at this club minding my tea. I saw this fine young thing so I thought that I would see. I don't smoke but I asked her for a cigarette. I know it's lame but I haven't got a better one yet. You guess the rest I'm not the type to fess. I sing this song because I tell you she's the best. That slinky girl is in my brain. Now I'll never be the same. No one can ever see. What that slinky girl means to me. So I'll just pretend. But I feel like. Mackadocious she's sweet and precocious. She's the one girl that I just dig, love, yes I'm not above this. You think that's wack then bro you lack. You bore me that macho crap makes me snore, see, me,. I'm all about the females, the women, the jewels of this world. Those flowers like that slinky girl. That slinky girl is in my brain. Now I'll never be the same. No one can ever see. What that slinky girl means to me. So I'll just pretend. But I feel like. Well I met her one night I'd seen her before. She stole my brain then showed me the door. Girls that do me like that there's not many. But I've met one, that's plenty. I'm glad to say that she gets her way. She can move me and that's okay. Has the power to turn paper inky. The girl has me and she's so. That slinky girl is in my brain. Now I'll never be the same. No one can ever see. What that slinky girl means to me. That slinky girl is in my brain. Now I'll never be the same. No one can ever see. What that slinky girl means to me."

In a pissing contest. That started out with atomic bombs. Mom will they drop the bomb. Will they think about their children's children. Be a forwardless mess and this. No one to call. You can't make them stall. I want to feed them to each other. Cause I'm sick of them all. How can't you see something's missing. Is anyone listening. We're shooting up flares. Does anyone care.

They got this world locked down bound and gagged. With constant fear and paranoia toxins in our head. It's just something they know how to do. How to make everyone feel uncalm. The masses just take it while they turn the screws. Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb. It's just something that we got to fight. How to make everyone feel uncalm. Keep us distracted with ???. Porno shows, MTV hoes, and all the radio. It's the same fucking song. That's just the way it goes. Cold turkey world to democracy's girls. From the rules of engagements sweet heart. This is the world. How can so many sit silent. Enough to the violence. We're shooting up flares. Does anyone care. They got this world locked down bound and gagged. The Botox, Barbie dolls, and magazine ads. It's just something they know how to do. How to make everyone feel uncalm. The masses just take it while they turn the screws. Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb. Embodying all that we know to be wrong. How to make everyone feel uncalm. When a war chant becomes a popular song"

starshines,I am a music lover some how I get paid. This song would still exist if no money was made. That's the difference. I summed it up in a sentence.

So many headz what if something would give. And kill off our race. Maybe diseases from space. Arriving from a comet. With a trail left for the planet. Say the wake it created was the start of the end. Filled with spores that were engineered. Plant pathogens. What's in the future for the view is many changes. Humans could be in danger. What would you eat to be a remainder. As your food is maimed. To take you out the frame. Some would vaporize. Some would remain. The same suckers with no cares about. The wave of the world I feel. Their lives are destined for hard times too. There's a parallel universe that might be blocked. But by emotion we put into it we could unlock. I'm not saying we could escape fate tunneling in this vast. Untranslatable energy filled of dust and ash.

still dreaming,No I'll not renounce my views. Do what others do. I'd rather drink the hemlock than be like you. To my soul untrue. It never gets easier. So quit tryin' pleasing her. Everything is a choice. So let me hear your voice. Born in October night. Feeling was out of sight. Skin I'm in now and then. Moves like a meteorite. Noise in our culture. Is built in our nature. Another era will decode. As we head toward rapture. Suppose we're all gifted. Suppose that the mist is. A metaphor for change. Suppose the veil will be lifted. Sacrament that I hold. Close and I feel noble. Solar marigolds light the souls. Return from that other world. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. There's so much here at stake. When every moment is just fleeting. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. It never gets easier. So quit tryin' pleasing her. Everything is a choice. So let me hear your voice. Rip up the evening post. Kill parasitic hosts. We can shoulder all the karma. That came with Los Alamos. Return the sky bottle blue. Return that forgotten hue. A looking glass world. Seeing into and through you. Soul and body are my twins. The latter will give in. When the former sees the ocean. As not too cold to get in. To alien life forms. These waters are real warm. But beware we will change the weather. And create a snowstorm. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. There's so much here at stake. When every moment is just fleeting. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. No I'll not renounce my views. Do what others do. I'd rather drink the hemlock than be like you. To my soul untrue. It never gets easier. So quit tryin' pleasing her. Everything is a choice. So let me hear your voice

summer of love,"I thought about my scene today. And I've finally got the words to say. The truth is cutting like a knife. Gonna use it to cut away my strife. The grass is green and the sky is blue. My head is clear and my thoughts are true. Callin' out young and old. We got a thing that can't be sold. The time that takes to rise above. In the summer of love. It's the summer. It's the summer. It's the summer of love I say. It's the summer. It's the summer. It's the summer of love I say. It's the summer. It's the summer. It's the summer of love I say. It's the summer. It's the summer. It's the summer of love I say. I wake up each day to the sun. And it's hard to chose what to do for fun. A blissful world surrounds me. And my brothers and sisters love is always free. Don't you know that I've waited my whole life. Just to show what's inside and let my love flow. That's what I'm sayin'. Callin' out young and old. We got a thing that can't be sold. The time that takes to rise above. In the summer of love. It's the summer. It's the summer. It's the summer of love I say. It's the summer. It's the summer. It's the summer of love I say.

taiyed,Returning from the water cold alive and shining. Rock a mic in the afterlife while your moon is rising. Heatin’ up forcing steam whirling to be seen. The dark held stars are the frost of my breathing. Swimming through the darkness I’m a ghostly shark. Developing like a photograph slowly in the dark. The hearafter the action the main attraction. One love in all of this that I’m going after. Now there’s fire inside but black space surrounds you. You think ’where oh where am i’. But even your light continues. See through us see a soul we have not yet. Learned to harness see the next world inside it. We are the people of skin who left water. Inside the dark womb inside of our mother. Prone to the beat and vibe of our tribe. We catch the drift and ride moving tides. Out from a love that will keep on burning. Now see yourself to the next world returning. This life an old place we face to live again. What is it to understand the heareafter
thank your lucky stars,"I need a break something inside me said. From TV people counting the dead. A break from all the sadness is what I. Need now, yeah. I've an ache and a loss for words. For apathy I sense in the herd. I've heard 'em and it's senseless no. Questioning it. And what's the point nothing so dull. Could ever on earth be brightened in entirely. Just think about it. And what's the point nothing so slight. Could ever on earth be enlightened entirely. Just think about it. Ask me, I'm not blind, I can read all the signs. So many have died, So many out of their minds. Thank your lucky stars you've got it good it's. Not hard. To be what you are, thank your lucky stars. We're in a place I thought we'd never get. People devolved and fought or they fled. But I do not know how we're goin' to get out of. It, woah. It's a mistake to be paranoid. A mental state that takes strength to avoid. All the hostility and fear should be challenged. Woah. Cuz what's the point of living that way. So many close their minds to what others say. Which ever feeling you voice. And what's the point, we're gonna pay. Sorted out one way or not we all have that day. So make your choice. Ask me, I'm not blind, I can read all the signs. So many have died, So many out of their minds. Thank your lucky stars you've got it good it's. Not hard. To be what you are, thank your lucky stars. Ask me, I'm not blind, I can read all the signs. So many have died, So many out of their minds. Thank your lucky stars you've got it good it's. Not hard. To be what you are, thank your lucky stars"
the call,We could say it's just how it is. And how it always will be. And believe things will never change. As far as we can see. It's a disaster and it doesn't matter. Well I disagree. A ray of hope remains if we take the reins we'll arrive eventually. Keep all the lights on in the streets of Babylon. Then we'll just dig for some more. Pull back the curtain cuz one things for certain. Action speaks louder than war. Look around there's no time left to stall. (You've got to) stand up while you can don't miss the call. Hold on here we go. Where we stop nobody knows. Breath and count to five. Live while you're still alive. Right before your eyes. Your best laid plan up and dies. Cleverly disguised. The bounty materialized. Now we're moving fast. We're picking up on speed. We got the energy. Creating fast. As we tunnel deep. & no time to think. Here we just react. To the things. We need. Hold on to your world. Look around there's no time left to stall. (You've got to) stand up while you can don't miss the call. To live just in your mind. Is some kind of crime. Stuck in your station. In isolation. Never too late for beginning. To set your captive free. Tonight the moment has arrived. To live while we're still alive. (Wake up and) look around there's no time left to stall. (You've got to) stand up while you can don't miss the call. (It's time to) end the debate don't hesitate this time. (C'mon on and) take a stance don't miss your chance. To stand up right now!
the continuous life,When things are outta whack. And they might collapse. And at the end of the day. You still can't relax. And physically you ache. Like a cavity feelin' the bind. On your mind and the rest. Of your body. Listen to your heartbeat. Flow and imagine. Become Jackson Pollack. Air brush Chinese dragons. On a sky blue convertion. Van or an electra. Buick of the mind full of. Fuminous matter. And slowly all the pressure. Recedes and you stop to decay. Naturally think clearly. Ultimately though your grace. Will give way to traffic jams. Submachine guns in hand. City red-necks who think. Like the Omega man. Feelin' the extremes. Of the times we're livin'. Stockpile spaghetti-o's. And cheerios plannin'. To survive that fall-out shit. It's not ambuguous }. It be continuous }. It's all about us }. It's for real my man } (2x). The continuous life there is no end }. Movin' through life }. Movin' through death }. My radio emits a signal form. A strange noise the kind of which. I've never heard before. I scan the dial for more stations. But all I get is an eerie feelin'. I'm not dreamin' this is the real dealin'. There's nothin' like this trance. I'm caught in a daze. Cuz I'm finally out of my body. The blue lights are ablaze. Yeah I'm really amazed. And feelin' so light that's right. Lift off and I'm into the sky. As if a hologram were created. To shift my conciousness. Changed again and I'm flung. In the riff. I wanna be free I wanna do right. I move through the portal. To be purified. It's not ambuguous }. It be continuous }. It's all about us }. It's for real my man } (3x). The continuous life there is no end }. Movin' through life }. Movin' through death }.
the great divide,"It? s like I stepped into a dream. I think you know what I mean. A reality break to a place unseen. Things come alive stupefied mind quarantined. From sleeping then awaken to somewhere in between. Ay, I? m on a cloud parfait. I jump into the valley of the far from mundane. My knees buckle a chuckle chuckle. Mutha fucka I get back up. Like there never was a scuffle. Strange like a tale from Brothers Grimm. They? re watching you we can? t look at them. Living life out here like on a limb. One or the other sink or swim. Maximum velocity. Yet speeding up so rapidly. There? s no where else I? d rather be, for me. They keep you high, won? t let you come down. Distract the facts ma? am, that? s the plan now. Where you work, where you lurk, what you search. Climb too much get off of that perch. Virtual reality your nightmare. On the grid, kid, getting nowhere. Get ahead, leave behind. Lose your mind find in time. A nowhere rhyme. Chemicals up in the atmosphere. Another meteor is falling near. Buried in the headlines disappear. I? m not the type to live in fear. You dream but I know you? re awake. Explaining a nightmare you couldn? t shake. Maybe the kool-aid that you drank today. We? re breaking away from the past. Reaching a new plane at last. Regardless of what cards get played. No one can keep you afraid. Unless you wanna be. You make that choice indubitably. They wanna play my emotions. But I? m like the ocean. Too calm to get upset by somebody? s notion. Future makers. Organ takers. A non-human intelligence is guiding. Worlds colliding. Far away star system. I string Dna where I need? em. What we gonna get with a zero field. Gotta have the one to make it real. I tell ya that more will be revealed. The mystery don? t bother me. Everyday masquerade. There? s always too many plans we laid. Keep going faster down the grade we made. We? re breaking away from the past. Reaching a new plane at last. Regardless of what cards get played. No one can keep you afraid. We? re always beginning. As sure as we? re spinning. For it? s never ending from here. After all this time. I am sorry I? m not sorry. Hate me later. Something greater. Than the petty here and now. Venture on. The sketch is not completely drawn. Travel wide. It? s not hiding inside. Venture on. The sketch is not completely drawn. Travel wide. Its out beyond the great divide"

time is precious,Watching the ice melt between us. Just faster than grass grows. ItÃ­s not the best that weÃ­ve seen us. But nothing else I'd have chose. Reminds me of a time.

I wonÃ­t go down. Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didnÃ­t miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. When you fight to resist. Emotion with a fist. An irresistible force will always. Prevail. The fortress goes crumbling down. Around you where you stand. What was once strong mortar. Is now a pile of sand. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that IÃ­m careful now. I wonÃ­t go down. Time is just as precious as you say it is. I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss. I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now. From reckless to recluse. And sometimes back again. Left wondering what's the use. Of a life of mischief spent. Makes cool the desert sun. The piece of mind that you gave me. Absolve me for things I've done. Only that can save me.

today my love,"Here I sit in idle envy. T.V. shows still holds me in. Thin steel creases my Impatience. Begging till the end. And then it hits me. And then I see, then I see. Today my love, we shall let the world slide. For we, will never be. Younger again. Well, I'm tired of the ladies and the stupid excuses. Sitting on my ass makes me feel useless. Earth accelerate, hurry up and turn that's right. I'm starting to burn. Well I get kinda mad like a ????? crawdad. It's time to throw down, too bad so sad. Don't step to me when things don't go as you planned. No, I don't give a damn. And then it hits me. And then I see, then I see. Today my love, we shall let the world slide. For we, will never be. Younger again, younger again. Younger again, younger again. It's easier to hurt than heal. Hipocrites they make me ill. Young men yearn to turn the tables. That too is a sin. And then it hits me. And then I see, then I see. Today my love, we shall let the world slide. For we, will never be. Younger again. We all look to the end of a certain social stress. I'm down for that day, but don't forget the progress. Of wakening things up the passion understanding. Here's to the youth who aren't afraid to put a hand in. And then it hits me. And then I see, then I see. Today my love, we shall let the world slide. For we, will never be. Younger again, younger again. Younger again, younger again."
too much to think,"Back again I'm holed up. In the waiting room again. Focused on the empty. Getting underneath my skin. How do I keep it?. How do I keep it here?. Look at how the time flies. Burning daylight to the ground. Wash away the ashes. Gonna quiet my head down. How do I keep it?. How do I keep it here?. 'Cause I wanna get high. But you're keeping me low. I don't got time to waste or time to kill. I've had too much to think. I wanna get high. But you're taking me down down down. Don't got time to waste or time to kill. I've had too much to think. Illuminate the shadow. And try to keep the light within (keep the light within). Avoid another battle. And forget what might have been. How do I keep it?. How do I keep it here?. 'Cause I wanna get high. But you're keeping me low. I don't got time to waste or time to kill. I've had too much to think. I wanna get high (I wanna get high). But you're taking me down down down. Don't got time to waste or time to kill. I've had too much to think. I've had too much to think. As I walk through the valley of the shadow of La. See the faces of the people as they run away. It's a permanent made distraction, the modern reaction. The people don't have to feel the dissatisfaction. It's a slow journey up but a quick ride on down. And nobody here knowing their way around. From the top of the world every which way is down. And who's gonna take the crown?. 'Cause I wanna get high (I wanna get high). But you're keeping me low (But you're keeping me low). I don't got time to waste or time to kill. I've had too much to think. I wanna get high (I wanna get high). But you're taking me down down down. Don't got time to waste or time to kill.

Just go with the motion. A lot of fish in the sea. Not for me. You're somethin' of a different kind. The rest evaporate, but you stay in my mind. There is a stone wall. Around your heart. Nothin left now to do but to start. Chippin away. Day by day. Until we see it break apart. Hear me talkin 'bout. Let it be known, it can be done. Bit by bit and one by one. If the two of us try.

uncalm,"Uncalm. Listen to the drummer just listen to the strings. Listen to the DJ just rappin and things. Once I get a message from you I get all edgy. My minds racing but my you know not ready uh. For you, baby all our dreams trickle through. We are back in your teenage beadroom. Salvador Dali honeymoon, for you. It's like you and me on Plymouth Rock. Embarking on a journey that I never thought would happen to me so effortlessly. Sparks flying, your laughter is a symphony. Spring, what a little moonlight can do. Soon the summer sun is on you. All the while we don't hear the news or feel blue. Chorus:. On the scales of desire your absence weighs more than someone else's presence. I wanna kiss reason goodbye today. I wanna show its purple essence. On your lips baby, it'll fade away return your natural iridescence. On the scales of desire your absence weighs more than someone else's presence. You make me feel uncalm uncalm and I think I like it. Make me think of a song that I could not write yet. Melodies create themselves I'm just a conduit. You make my heart accelerate and I'm on to it. For you baby there's so much that I will do to be near the sweetness on you. Funny everything seems so new when with you. (Chorus). On the scales of desire your absence weighs more than someone else's presence. Uncalm."
unity,"Even if I cared to try I couldn't please them.. Their petty complaints, stupid restraints ain't gonna work.. It's all to cheese and regret, don't fret, just push it away.. And say I'm like the wind, relentless and irritating.. A position that I think worth stating.. Swing I'm doin' my thing.. Groove I'm showin' and provin'.. That maverick deal that makes you feel ill..

I ain't got to my ace in the whole yet,. bet that I will. Get my fill, get my thrill.. We'll be back one day and we'll try not to spite.. But until then you stay out of my sight.. Oh, God, I can't believe it this groove's so dope. I'm about to have a fit and here's a flash. I freaked so hard I got whiplash.. And when it comes to writing stay away from our stash..

My brain is on fire it feels like I'm flying. through space. Yes doing my best but it'll get better this much I confess.. Oh God I can't believe it but when this era's through I'll say that's it..

use of time,"With the words staying me slow. The verbs that just don't flow. Confusing use of time. Partial stoning of the heart. Waiting for something to start. Confusing use of time. But the trying again. Makes me think it's all gonna end. Confusing use of time. But everytime I turn the volume down. All the I hear is the deafening sound. Of you hearts pound. But the trying again. Makes me think it's all gonna end. Confusing use of time. Today, the longest day. Hearing repeating things you'd say. Confusing use of time. Can you hear the void I describe. What could I say vacancy sounds like. Confusing use of time. But the trying again. Makes me think it's all gonna end. Confusing use of time."

On and on it's anybody's guess cuz no one's at the wheel at the front of. that mess yes.. The sun's goin' down for me it's goin' down for me.. He and she are what I need yes they're what I need..

waiting,"No matter what I do. I always wait for you. So I guess then thats what i gotta do. Chorus:. It seems I'm spending so much time, waiting. And when you can't make up your mind. I'm waiting for you. If thats what it requires. Then waitings what I'll do. So hurry up the bus, I'm waiting. Just hang up that phone. You already know on your own. What you need to do. What you got to do. Feels like I'm losing my mind. You know that it feels just fine. Chorus. I know you dig it. When we're together. And your not just acting that way. Take your money. And double your bet. Just because. Yyou're happy. So watch out. Take my love down to your pawn shop. Tell me baby what should I get. A wedding ring and a boom box, boom box, boom box, boom box, OWW. And what else can I say. It will do no good anyway. As long as you know that I'll keep waiting. Chorus. And what else can I say. It will do no good anyway. As long as you know that I'll keep waiting.

wake your mind up,"Chorus:. Wake your mind up clear your eyes up. Move and rise up before your times up. Clock is ticking, you're caught slippin. Stop to realize look and listen. Well I guess that's life when you see a dark road up the way. And I guess that's life when you gotta roll through anyway. Now don't scream, don't fight fear, never ever made it go away. Some ghost town as yesterday. Made you feel like love was miles away. (Chorus). Now those sleepless nights thoughts just cloud up my brain. Feeling helpless repeating the same old memories of pain and I wish it would rain, yo. Gimme starlit skies fro dreamland. I know it's really smaller than it seems. But when the pressure gets under my skin. I just wanna get out and scream in the wind, yo. The world we're livin in is complicated. The streets that we walk on are dark and jaded. A wandering soul that's filled with hatred. In it is poison the youth is tainted. Social engineering keeps us seperated. Media control is highly overrated. Ignorance is bliss to those uneducated. Listen to the message cuz it's time we faced it. (Chorus). I'm controller of my destination. Gotta change my mind to help me break away. The sun creeps over the hillside to shed this light. No man could ever take away. I guess that's life you see a new side from the norm. A new direction and meaning to the form. And the calm in the eye of the storm, yo. Show me a desert that can never be drenched. I'll show you a thirst that can never be quenched. Temptation chronicles, the story of my life. Been spent on a dose of balancing strife. Inspiration it comes and goes. You can bet when it hits I'm on the phone. Singing to my voicemail trying to get it down. In a sensation of shape shifting sound. You're telling fables to cover up your foibles. From overindulgence on things you find enjoyable. Designed to take my mind away from truth. Try to make me play the sleuth. They want you to think someone's watching you. So they can make up a set of rules for you. I'm just trying to find a path that I can stomach. Just trying to make some sense out from it. Don't stop what you got. Don't stop til you find the sweet spot. (Chorus)."

welcome,Groove as your soul sings. Spinnin' all around as we dust a melody. Welcome to this groove you can move right. We gonna take you higher not caught in the quagmire. I can't survive on a stupid nine to five I'd rather be poor. Writing tunes livin' on a commune. Kickin' it with my brothers and significant others. Life in pursuit of only money we think it's funny. The only thing that money it could ever bring to me. Would be some gifts for my friends follow me now. Trips for my family. The only thing I love is freedom the people around me I need 'em I'd. like to build the world a spliff but like I said I said. You could never get me interested in dreams of wealth. Myself my birthday happens to land on April twelfth whack. A Coney Island of the mind it's mine. I swipe the sweets strip the beats in the sunshine. Loco holmes I stroll because I'm thinking. A tone poem alone is love medicine then the demon. Spring revolution in my spirit here it is and I will kill with it. Traveling head spinnin' from the medicine. Illusions fadin' out an comin' on again. unwind your mind then find entire minutes abstract. the tract of sight day breaking in it. doles out my share of the world ocean and sun. Rising with whirling motion. I fought kicked and screamed my way to getting born now I feel. Warm and I say come on the night won't save anyone. won't you roam. We've grown so we can write again our soul select its own way for. The travellin'. we're here we're breathing and we wanna keep our. Blood running so we're gonna keep gunning till the next homecoming. I like the boogie to the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie. To the bang bang come on.

And you beat the odds stacked against you.. Its a miserable life that you've made,. And the paranoia you have to get used to.. But they've got better things to do,. Than to come and look for you.. But then again maybe not.. It'll drive you crazy.. Now its been about a year. You'd return but for the fear.. Sometimes people get away.. Still it haunts you till this day,. Feeling they've gone away.. Na na na, na na na.."

whiskey and wine,"I know what you're thinking. I know I did you wrong. I've just got this feeling. Baby, please hold on. The way we used to dance. We forgot the steps. We both lost our balance. I drink to forget. Whiskey and Wine. Killing me, shot at a time. You put the liquor in the cup. And then you swirl it around. Cause you don't remember if you're up or you're down. A temporary fix, a moments elixir yeaaaaaaaah. And I will say. I put my head in the air. And I won't do it again no. Can't promise it because I don't pretend it. No ahhh, the price I pay, a yeah yay. Not a remedy before a friend. I'll will say it again now. Whiskey and Wine. Killing me, shot at a time. Whiskey and Wine. Killing me, shot at a time"
white man in hammersmith palais (a clash cover song),"Midnight to six man. for the first time from Jamaica. Dillinger and Leroy Smart. Delroy Wilson, your cool operator. Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae. With backing bands sound systems. if they've got anything to say. there's many black ears here to listen. But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right. charging from the bass knives to the treble. but onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel. onstage they ain't got no... roots rock rebel. Dress back jump back this is a bluebeat attack. jones'in won't get you anywhere. fooling with your guns. the British Army is waiting out there. an' it weighs fifteen hundred tons. White youth, black youth. better find another solution. why not phone up Robin Hood. and ask him for some wealth distribution. Punk rockers in LA. they won't notice anyway. they're all too busy fighting. for a good place under the lighting. The new groups are not concerned. with what there is to be learned. they got Burton suits, ha you think it's funny. turning rebellion into money. All over people changing their votes. along with their overcoats. if Adolf Hitler flew in today. they'd send a limousine anyway. And the all night drug-prowling wolf. who looks so sick in the sun. and the white man in the Palais. But you go lookin' for fun. I'm only looking for fun. oh please mister, leave me alone. and I'm only looking for fun. looking for fun. (breathing). ow!."

wild nights,"I had to find out. Figure it for myself. Now I have no doubt. What it looks like in hell. Nights of sweet mischief. I lifted quite a few. Let’s light the fuse quick. And see just what this thing can do. Let’s just get crazy with it. Once again give it a spin my friend. We’re gonna test the limits. Where would we be. Without the wild nights. Without the lows and highs. Failing to get it right. Where would we be. Without the wild nights. Barely getting by. The days of getting high. Spinnin’ with the rhythm in this world will bring. DJ’s on Friday nights hungover mornings. I wanna live a little. And no it’s not a riddle. Your attention yeah. I want in the middle. Take it up and we hit the stage. Wrecking ball effect is how we rage. Pay the price for months and days. Once in the clouds now it’s just haze. Let’s just get crazy with it. Once again give it a spin my friend. We’re gonna test the limits. Where would we be. Without the wild nights. Without the lows and highs. Failing to get it right. Where would we be. Without the wild nights. Barely getting by. The days of getting high. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh. Where would we be. Without the wild nights. Without the lows and highs. Failing to get it right. Where would we be. Without the wild nights. Barely getting by. The days of getting high. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh"
you get worked,"This is happening this here is life. Days spent pondering truth is a knife. Respect due to those who have caught it. Dedicated to our friends who have sought it. This is happening this here is life. Days spent pondering truth is a knife. Respect due to those who have caught it. Dedicated to our friends who have sought it. Brainstorm superseding the norm. When we come together new planet is born. You revel in the chaos when people are torn. Then you come to find out your welcome is worn. We are advancing and retracting visionaries. Really here it's not imaginary. The way you work your mind you find it's an art. Where you feel it most you feel in your heart. Everybody gets confused. Delusions are everywhere. Buy into fakeness you'll feel used. Double talk fills the air. Looking all over for happiness. I've got the will to live. It's in front of you right now, don't you feel stressed. Falls through my hands like a sieve. I'm on a new high, with a pen and a pad. And for fun I attend a jam that's super bad. At the same time give it all that I have. Whether you're square, or the coolest lad. Eatin up my people, purgin their words. The jammies take flight like lcarus birds. Drop on you and you get hurt. Cuz if you're under the rock. You get worked. Say, what gives are you after me. Breakin me down won't you let me be. Won't be having none of your mind control. It ain't gonna work on me no more. I said, what gives are you after me. Breakin me down won't you let me be. Won't be having none of your mind control. It ain't gonna work on me no more. You get worked. If you don't watch your back. People are scheming on you. Exploiting all the things you lack. They'll do what they have to do. Your good will is something they'll crack. How many times will they bust. Your originality they will hack. Don't know just who you can trust. I'm on a new high, with a pen and a pad. And for fun I attend a jam that's super bad. At the same time give it all that I have. Whether you're square, or the coolest lad. Eatin up my people, purgin their words. The jammies take flight like lcarus birds. Drop on you and you get hurt. Cuz if you're under the rock. You get worked, yeah you get worked. Say, what gives are you after me. Breakin me down won't you let me be. Won't be having none of your mind control. It ain't gonna work on me no more. You get worked."
you wouldn't believe,"He was a king 'til she laid waste. Now he cannot fill up the space. And I just see him drifting, while he's drifting. On bourbon alley feeling low. Just because she let him go. I don't think he even knows. He'll ever be fine. Chorus:. And he's got head full of ideas. Let me tell ya, that you wouldn't believe. And he's got a heart made of pure gold. And something else. Many tricks up his sleeve. You might think he's a jester because. He'll make you laugh till you cry. And what else. You better come with your best, if you test him. Unless you're ready to die. . Wonder Woman got rid of wonder man. That man's not part of her wonder plan. Letter to the so-called better bet on my man. Believe it you will find out baby. Damn. (Chorus). A million people come and go. Through a person's ebb and flow. And faces keep on changing, while they're changing. A certain few will stay in tact. When they're not they'll don an act. I know this important fact. Don't get confused like. (Chorus). First you love him then you're loving him not. All the while he just smiles giving all that he's got. Do you find it in your heart to say he's not what you sought. Do you want me to continue with this or what. Whoa yeah, whoa yeah. (Chorus)."
