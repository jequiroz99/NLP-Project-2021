lonesome town,There's a place where lovers go. To cry their troubles away. And they call it Lonesome Town. Where the broken heart stays. You can buy a dream or two. To last you all through the years. And the only price you pay. Is a heart full of tears. Going down to Lonesome Town. Where the broken hearts stay. Going down to Lonesome Town. To cry my troubles away. In the town of broken dreams. The streets are filled with regret. Maybe down in Lonesome Town. I can learn to forget. Maybe down in Lonesome Town. I can learn to forget.
poor little fool,I used to play around with hearts that hastened at my call. But when I met that little girl I knew that I would fall. Poor little fool oh yeah I was a fool uh huh. (Uh huh poor little fool I was your fool oh yeah). She played around and teased me with her carefree devil eyes. She'd hold me close and kiss me but her heart was full of lies. Poor little fool.... She told me how she cared for me and that we'd never part. And so for the very first time I gave away my heart. Poor little fool.... The next day she was gone and I knew she'd lied to me. She left me with a broken heart and won her victory. Poor little fool.... Well I'd played this game with other hearts but I never thought I'd see. The day that someone else would play love's foolish game with me. Poor little fool...

a flower opens gently,"Feeling crowded sidewalks burn. And lonely couples never learn. Paying tributes to our dead. With empty words we never said. Goodbye, so long.. Spilling time at every turn. Living lives of no return. As stately figures compromise. A flower opens gently by. Goodbye, so long.. Like fearless barks of frightened dogs. We hide behind some worthy cause. AS anger starts it's empty rise. A flower opens gently by. Goodbye, so long.. It hurts so bad to lose a friend. There's a valley where the river's been. While all you wingless birdmen try to fly. A flower closes gently by. Goodbye, so long.. Bye bye, so long..."

I was gonna wed the little river girl just over the bridge across town. Now I'm a runnin' up and down the river and my nerves are drivin' me wild. Because the bridge washed out I can't swim and my baby's on the other side. Rain oh rain stop a fallin' dark clouds hurry from the sky. The preacher and my bride are waitin' and the weddin' bells are startin' to chime. I can't kiss and hold her and it's drivin' me out of my mind. Cause the bridge washed out I can't swim and my baby's on the other side. [ guitar ]. Now I got one foot in the river one foot solid on the ground. I try to swim that ragin' old river but I know if I try I'd drown. There's not a boat around me they walked on out with the tide. Cause the bridge washed out I can't swim and my baby's on the other side. Cause the bridge washed out I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
bright lights and country,I won't stay home and cry tonight like all the nights before. I've just learned that I don't really need you anymore. I found a little place downtown where guys like me can go. And they've got bright lights and country music. Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass. Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past. And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast. I'll say those bright lights and country music. [ dobro ]. A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine. Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds. And nothing else can take away this loneliness of mine. Quite like those bright lights and country music. Bright lights and country music.... I love those bright lights and country music

palace guard,"With handmade silver sparkles. Like a well-dressed sequined whore. Your lady-like deceptions. Keep reaching out for more. And you ask me for nothing. And nothing’s not enough. And the fisherman he puts a claim on you. But it’s nothing but a bluff. So with jealous hands tied round my back. I stumble cross the floor. Not knowing how to speak. I keep reaching for the door. I know you know me well I say. Cause I’m the palace guard. Remember me, we made love today. At the King’s bazaar. And you look at me with eyes that never see. I can feel something start to die inside of me. And you speak in wordless freedoms never seen. Now I realize to you it’s all a dream. So before you show me everything. There’s something I must know. I’ve worked with your friend John the Geek. And his sidewalk trav’lin’ show. I know your childhood tailored dreams are very well disguised. So you don’t have to fake it anymore it’s all been memorized. And you speak in wordless freedoms never seen. Now I realize to you it’s all a dream. And you speak to me with feelings. As real as sealing wax. As the nearness dawns the moth is gone. Leaving trailless tracks. All you village people. Sing your songs of the morning sunlit sky. Don’t you think it’s time we moved along.

wings,Seen it written and I heard it told. that a man does things for gold. drives him crazy and it makes him old. before his time. . Sitting round waiting for the rainbows end. wasting time and losing friends. never knowing that it ends before his eyes. but those of us who seek the truth. will be there when she rides. . Talking 'bout wings. to carry us over the water. talking 'bout wings. picking us up by the waves. ahh so many things can bread misunderstanding. we'll soon be landing on velvet wings. . Once met a man and his words were wise. and he looked me in the eyes. he said brother don't you compromise. in what you feel. all things figure in a bigger plan. and its up to every man. just to do the best to reach his own ideals. and build a world around himself. and live it like he feels. . repeat chorus twice

Yes sir, that's my baby now. [instrumental interlude]. By the way, by the way. When we run into the preacher I'll say. I'll say yes sir, that's my baby. No sir, I don't mean maybe.

yesterday's love,"When I get to thinking about the past. and all of the good things that were too good to last. I cry in my heart for each little part. of yesterday's love. A few tender moments when heaven was mine. the vows that you whispered. with each kiss was divine how empty they seem. they're lost in a dream. with yesterday's love. . somewhere I lost you along the way. lost without knowing the price that I'd pay. I can't help but wonder how things would have been. if I could start over and try it again. but love has its problems and bridges to burn. you have to cross over and you never return. for dreams have their day and then fade away. with yesterday's love, yesterday's love, yesterday's love"

you're free to go,You're free to go darling I'll break the ties that bind. Somehow the dreams we planned have gone astray. You're free to go darling so ease your worried mind I'll never stand in your way. There's no ring of shining gold so strong that it can hold. A heart when it longs to be free. The lips are cold darling that once said yes to me. The tender glow is gone I know you're free to go. There's no ring of shining gold...
