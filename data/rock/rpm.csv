"london, london","I'm wandering round and round, nowhere to go. I'm lonely in London, London, is lovely so. I cross the streets without fear, everybody keeps the way clear. I know, I know, there's no one here to say hello. I know they keep the way clear, I am lonely in London without fear. I'm wandering round and round, nowhere to go. While my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. But my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. Oh, Sunday, Monday, Autumn pass by me. And people hurry on so peacefully. A group approach the policeman, he seems so pleased to please them. It's good to live at least and I agree. He seemed so pleased at least and it's so good to live in peace. And Sunday, Monday years and I agree. While my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. But my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. I choose no face to look at, choose no way. I just happen to be here and it's ok. Green grass, blue eyes, gray sky, God bless, silent, pain and happiness. I came around to say yes, and I say. Green grass, blue eyes, gray sky, God bless, silent, pain and happiness. I came around to say yes, and I say. While my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. But my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. While my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky. Yes my eyes, go looking for flying saucers in the sky"

show it to me,"In the passageways of this place. The eyes are gazed by its tortured souls. Streets full of walking bones. People's tears are like a stream. Everywhere I look I can see a falen person. In a sordid gutter. Agora!. In a city of fear a glow. Is telling me it's me and it is time to say. Let's go in this promised land. children of the war. Come back to me. (The Children with the guns). So let's go, while we're still surviving. While the days still shine for me. I can't tell those images of horror. I could never say that. It should be. Easier to me It should be. Show it to me!. While the two of us are still on the streets. Then, in the sun i see. I can see a miracle It's so intense. Im my dreams I've seen your face. Im my dreams I've seen your face. In my dreams I've your face....... Im my dreams..."
