The line isn't black, if you know that it's green. Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see. Who's coming on like he wanted to be. And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five. Who's got the feeling that he came alive. Though havin' it, sharin' it ain't quite the same. It ain't no gold nugget, you can't lay a claim. Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor. There it is baby, don't you worry no more. Who should be sleepin', but is writing this song. Wishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damned wrong."

What you do and what you see. Lover, can you talk to me?."
rock and roll woman,"There's a woman that you ought to know. And she's coming, singing soft and low. Singing rock and roll, she's a joy to know. 'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand. I am free there, just to make my plans. Dream of faraway lands, and I think, close at hand. And she will follow me wide, do you know. Familiar places she's been by, that I know. Could it be, she don't have to try. And tomorrow, she's a friend of mine. And the sorrow, I see her face is lined. She's no longer blind, she's just hard to find"
sad memory,Soft winds blow in the summer time. Young lovers feel so free. Walkin’ hand and hand down a shady lane. What happen to me. What happen to me. Did you ever love a girl. Who walked right out on you. You should know just how I feel and. Why I’m so blue. Why I’m so blue. How can I forget those nights. When she kiss me soft and true. And whispered words only lovers know ooh. I love you. I love you. Well I made up my mind. I’ll find a new girl who love me tenderly. Forget the past I left behind now. To sad memories. To sad memories
sit down i think i love you,"Sit down I think I love you. Anyway I'd like to try. I can't stop thinking of you. If you go I'll know I cry. Can't you see that I'm a desperate man. I can hide, just being around. You want to know. What they say about the bird in my hand. And that's why I ain't leaving without you. So if you want someone to love you. Pretty babe I'm your guy. It's not much I'm asking of you. Just please give me a try."
special care,"Out there in the window,. Lookin' at me, do you think I'm,. Blowing' my cool, playin' the fool?. You there on the corner,. Starin' at me, do you think I'm,. Trouble? Would you like to shoot me down?. (Instrumental). And it's time for all that Special Care to be taken,. To make you aware of the forsaken,. If you don't care then we'll come and burn your house down.. (Spoken or yelled out loud). Come on over sometime and talk about how all men are created equal,. Only some they mo' equal than others."
there goes my baby,The end has come. The sky has lost it's sun. The harm is done. He was the only one. There goes my babe. There goes what might have been. There goes my babe. In the cool morning rain. And now my heart. Lies empty and still again. If he were here. I'd long to hold him near. But now it's clear. The price of love is dear. There goes my babe. There goes what might have been. There goes my babe. In the cool morning rain. And now my heart. Lies empty and still again
