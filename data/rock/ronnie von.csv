you've got to hide your love away,"Here i stand head in hand. Turn my face to the wall. Feeling two foot small. Everywhere people stare. Each and everyday. I can see them laugh at me. And i hear them say. Hey. You've got to hide your love away. Hey. You've got to hide your love away. How can i even try?. I can never win. Hearing them seeing them. In the state i'm in. How could she say to me. ""Love will find a way"". Gather 'round all you clowns. Let me hear you say. Hey. You've got to hide your love away. Hey. You've got to hide your love away"
