And you can do this (oh baby) if you try.. All that I want for you my son,. Is to be satisfied.. (Chorus). Boy, don't you worry... you'll find yourself.. Follow you heart and nothing else.. And you can do this if you try.. All I want for you my son,. Is to be satisfied.. (Chorus)"

burning bright,"I feel like there is no need for conversation. Some questions are better left without a reason. And I would rather reveal myself than my situation. Now and then I consider, my hesitation. (Chorus). The more the light shines through me. I pretend to close my eyes. The more the dark consumes me. I pretend I'm burning. Burning bright. I wonder if the things I did. Were just to be different. To spare myself of the constant shame of my existence. And I would surely redeem myself in my desperation. Here and now I'll express, my situation. (Chorus) (X2). The more the light shines through me. I pretend to close my eyes. The more the dark consumes me. I pretend I'm burning bright. The more the light shines through me. I pretend to close my eyes. The more the dark consumes me. I pretend I'm burning. There's nothing ever wrong. But nothing's ever right. Such a cruel contradiction. I know I cross the lines. Its not easy to define. I'm born to indecision. There's always something new. Some path I'm supposed to choose. With no particular rhyme or reason. (Chorus) (X2). The more the light shines through me. I pretend to close my eyes. The more the dark consumes me. I pretend I'm burning bright.

her name is alice,"(If I had a world of my own everything would be none sense). (Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't). I invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time. And every creature lends themself to change your state of mind. And the girl that chased the rabbit drank the wine and took the pill. Has locked herself in limbo to see how it truly feels. To stand outside your virtue. No one can ever hurt you. Or so they say. Her name is Alice (Alice). She crawls into the window. Through shapes and shadows. Alice (Alice). And even though she is dreaming, she knows. Sometimes the curiosity can kill the soul but leave the pain. And every ounce of innocence is left inside the brain. And through the looking glass we see she's faithfully returned. But now off with her head I fear is everyone's concern. You see there's no real ending. It's only the beginning. Come out and play. Her name is Alice (Alice). She crawls into the window. Through shapes and shadows. Alice (Alice). And even though she's dreaming. She's unlocked the meaning for you. This kingdom could rid us her freedom and innocence. Has brought this whole thing down. Her name is Alice (Alice). She crawls into the window. Through shapes and shadows. Alice (Alice). And even though she is dreaming. She's unlocked the meaning. She's unlocked the meaning for you.

heroes,"Stare in wonder, who's here to bring you down?. Find your martyr, I'm sure you've made the crown. So light a fire under my bones, so when. I die for you, at least I'll die alone. Ain't nothing for me to end up like this. There's no comparing me this time. All my heroes have now become ghosts. Sold their sorrow to the ones who paid the most. All my heroes are dead and gone. But they're inside of me, they still live on. Dark devotion in a beacon paradise. Shows no emotion to a willing sacrifice. You can put a man on trial, but you can't make the guilty pay. And you can cage an animal, but you can't take away the rage. Ain't nothing for me to end up like this. There's no comparing me this time. All my heroes have now become ghosts. Sold their sorrow to the ones who paid the most. All my heroes are dead and gone. But they're inside of me, they still live on. All my heroes have now become ghosts.

Stain my mind with make believe. If it's dark, she still shines. She's my lady, so divine. Lady so divine, come and change my name. Lady so divine. When the waves break, and the soul shake. Wreckage from the night. On a mountain is a story. Told a thousand times. Of a garden, and a bed there. Made to rest our eyes. There's a comfort to a softness. That will not be here tonight. She's here to rescue me. Clear my mind, and set me free. If it's dark, she still shines. A masterpiece made by design. She's here to rescue me. Stain my mind with make believe. If it's dark, she still shines. She's my lady, so divine. Lady so divine, come and change my mind. Lady so divine. The midnight sun, she saves me. From what I've become. The midnight sun, she saves me. From what I have done. What I have done. She's here to rescue me. Clear my mind, and set me free. If it's dark, she still shines. A masterpiece made by design. She's come to rescue me. Stain my mind with make believe. If it's dark, she still shines. She's my lady, so divine. Divine!. Divine!. Divine!. She's my lady so divine. Divine!. She's my lady so divine. Lady so divine, come and change my mind. Lady so divine. By Carol Maphoter"
left out,"Where's that space of fear you hide?. Have you gone way beyond the center. Out there in space. I know you need to get even. Tell me the one about the hand that holds you down. Because the bruise on your face, it always seems to stay around. And tell me the one about the hand that holds you down. Because you seem to be lost, with no intention to be found. So how does it feel. And how does it feel. To be the one whose always in the way. To be the words that never made the page. Be the one that's always. Left out in the rain. Tell me again about the spark that met the flame. And tell me again about the man who went insane. Is there a place within for redemption. Is there a voice inside with a decision. And if so when, and if so then, where's the conviction. So how does it feel. And how does it feel. CHORUS. I know that you need to get even. And I know it's for all the right reasons. And I, well I know that your staring at the edge. And I, well I know that you need to get even. CHORUS"
lost in the crowd,"Should I offer up my hand. And save a wish for once. For all of us. And should I offer up my hand. And lay the guilt on myself. So it's easier , to not stay, to not stay. [Chorus]. Because I found you in your corner. I pulled you out of the clouds. You left in such a hurry. Your face got lost in the crowd. Should I open up my eye's or just ignore who you are. And what you could have been. And should I open up my eye's and make believe you will change. So it's easier to not stay, to not stay"

misfits,"Staring back in time. The two of us intertwined. And your black boots. Walking fast next to mine. We were chasing the thunder inside the storm. Running so wild outside the norm. And what we made. The two of us against the grain. Come out, come out, wherever you are. I know you're there, I know you are. They called us crazy cuz we never fit in. We never thought of keeping up with their trends. It didn't matter that we weren't on the list. Cause we were misfits, we were misfits. Staying up all night. Drinking more than we should. Getting way too high. When the sun came through. I watched you laugh. I saw you cry. Cuz the world has a way of tearing you down. Keeps you tied to the surface. Paints you up like a clown. But I'm right here. Day after day, year after year. Come out, come out, wherever you are. I know you're there, I know you are. They called us crazy cuz we never fit in. We never thought of keeping up with their trends. It didn't matter that we weren't on the list. Cause we were misfits, we were misfits. And after all we never played by the rules. We broke the mould and found our own kind of cool. It didn't matter that we weren't on the list. Cause we were misfits, we were misfits. Don't wait up. Don't wait up. Don't wait up. Don't wait up. Don't wait up. Don't wait up. We're long gone. They called us crazy cuz we never fit in. We never thought of keeping up with their trends. It didn't matter that we weren't on the list.

never gonna let go,Balanced on a wire. High above the earth tonight. Looking for an answer. Finding that warning sign. Slowly falling. Into my emotions. Drowning in an ocean. And I can't find you. Balanced on a wire. High above the earth tonight. Now I'm hanging by a thread. But I never felt so alive. And to the very last minute. We will always be death defying. Caught in the act of flying solo. This acrobat is lost. And I don't know. Where I'll land. As I reach for your hand. All of the lights can be so blinding. Every time I jump you always find me. Without a net. So please don't forget. Cause right now I'm out of control. Swear you're never gonna let go. Tell me not to look down. Promise that you're gonna stay. Spinning like a top now. Feeling like I'm gonna break. Into nothing. Tell me that there's still hope. Back up on the tightrope. Faster and faster. Balanced on a wire. High above the earth tonight. And it doesn't make sense. How me and you still survive. To the very last minute. We will always be death defying. Caught in the act of flying solo. This acrobat is lost. And I don't know. Where I'll land.

no more love,It's cold outside I'm sensing fear. My self control has disappeared. I'm spinning out at each end. Could you be kind and let me in. Despite the writing on the wall. My future's bleak and rather small. That's all you could ever take from me. I've got nothing to lose so let me be. Well I sized you up your not that strong. You're weak inside I knew all along. This made up army you fight in your head. Destroyed your worth and pronounced you dead. [CHORUS]. There's no more love. There's no more love. There' no more love for me and you (Listen to me). No more love. There's no more love. There' no more love for me and you (Listen to me). The cruelest joke that has played on me. Is all planned out so I can't leave. Now quietly I will walk away. There is no bad blood but I can't stay. There is no more love because there is no more love. [CHORUS (2)]. There's no more love. There's no more love. There' no more love for me and you (Listen to me). No more love. There's no more love. There' no more love for me and you (Listen to me)

Stop waitin' on your fifteen minutes of fame, 'cause you're not special. I'm not tryin' to rain on your parade, but you're not special. I'm not tryin' to bring you down, I'm not tryin' to sound so ineffectual. 'Cause you're not special. We all live to love, we all fall apart. We'd all go to war for the faint of heart. Instead we're condescending. There are no happy endings. I won't hold my breath, I won't cast a doubt. I'd never sell you out. But I'll give you one last chance to own it. 'Cause you're not a god or a poet, so. Stop waitin' on your fifteen minutes of fame, 'cause you're not special. I'm not tryin' to rain on your parade, but you're not special. I'm not tryin' to bring you down, I'm not tryin' to sound so ineffectual. But you're not special. (Get up, get up, get a move on). (Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong) But you're not special. (Get up, get up, get a move on). (Stop stallin', I'm callin' out) But you're not special. 'Cause you're not special. 'Cause you're not special"
state of my head,"That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head. That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head. It's been a long bumpy ride, sitting back in the saddle. It's time to get down, dirty up my knees, into battle. I'll come around, let the boys gonna make the walls rattle. Oh, our flag is tattered and our bones are shattered. But it doesn't matter cause we're moving forward. Round 'em up, round 'em up, let's go. Round 'em up, let's go. Oh, my eyes are seeing red. Double vision from the blood we've shed. The only way I'm leaving is dead. That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head. They don't know where we've been. We got that concrete thick skin. The only way I'm leaving is dead.

Yeah, I'm full of deep cuts right down to the marrow. But there's no doubt we'll get out from the bottom of the barrel. Oh, a flag is tattered and our bones are shattered. But it doesn't matter cause we're moving forward. Round 'em up, round 'em up, let's go. Round 'em up, let's go. Oh, my eyes are seeing red. Double vision from the blood we shed. The only way I'm leaving is dead. That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head. They don't know where we've been. We got that concrete street skin. The only way I'm leaving is dead.

Can you hear me know, can you hear me know. I'm coming back for more. Do you feel me know, do you feel me know. I'm breaking down your door. I'm not speaking under my breath. Cus' the harder you push, the rougher I'll get. Cus' I'm not shaking when the earth starts quaking. Got my own foundation with no hesitation. And, oh, my eyes are seeing red. Double vision from the blood we shared. The only way I'm leaving is dead. That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head. They don't know where we've been. We got that concrete street skin. The only way I'm leaving is dead. That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head. The only way I'm leaving is dead. That's the state of my, state of my, state of my head.

This day could be the worst one yet. I just won't relax I can't catch my breath. Because I'm sick and tired of you'll be fine. Well how do you know, can you read minds. [Pre Chorus]. So take while you can so you can meet demands. My insanity is what you thrive on. So rip it from my soul, so everyone will know in the end. We were never friends. [Chorus]. Have you ever felt lost inside so unloved within that you almost die. Have you ever stepped out of the light and realized there's a stranger inside. Don't push your ignorance on me. I'm not unrehearsed to your jealousy. And I know you think I don't see the signs. Well how do you know, do I look blind. [2nd Pre Chorus]. So take it while you can so you can meet demands. My breakdown is what you thrive on. So rip it from my soul so everyone will know in the end. I'm the break you're the bend. [Chorus]. [Bridge]. Stranger inside. [Chorus out]"
the crow and the butterfly,"I painted your room at. Midnight, so I'd know. Yesterday was over. I put all your books. On the top shelf,. Even the one with. The four leaf clover. Man, I'm getting older. I took all your pictures. Off the wall and wrapped. Them in a news paper blanket. I haven't slept in what seems. Like a century, and now I can. Barely breathe. Just like a crow chasing the butterfly. Dandelions lost in the summer sky. When you and I were getting. High as outter space, I never. Thought you'd slip away. I guess I was just a little too late. You're words still serenade me,. You're lullabies won't let me sleep. I've never heard such a haunting. Melody. Oh, it's killing me. You know I can barely breathe. Just like a crow chasing the butterfly. Dandelions lost in the summer sky. When you and I were getting. High as outter space, I never. Thought you'd slip away. I guess I was just a little too late. Just like a crow chasing the butterfly. Dandelions lost in the summer sky. When you and I were getting. High as outter space, I never. Thought you'd slip away. Like a crow chasing the Butterfly. Dandelions lost in the summer sky. When you and I were getting. High as outter space, I never. Thought you'd slip away. I guess I was just a little too late. Just a little too late"
the dream,"Whisper in the yard and turn the trees all into toys. Lay there on the ground, and turn the dirt into your joy. From what I see and what I know, it's all been boring lately. So I suggest we trade a question mark in for a maybe. Time your riddles right, and make a point that has no sense. Make sure that you're smiling, and the money's been well spent. Innocence and ignorance, it all goes hand in hand. I'm not sure that I'm right, but I hope you'll understand. I hope that you're still searching for the start that has no end. And all the plastic people have now become your friends. Before you start to drift and your soul begins to strain. I just wanted to tell you. that you're listening to a dream. .

thick as thieves,"Evidently we can't work it out. I guess that courage ain't allowed. Evidently you're not in the mood. And everything I say just bothers you. You built this portrait. I stumble towards it. Evidently you look furious. Walls up and I know you're serious. Evidently I'm not always there. But you left and I looked everywhere. You built this portrait. I stumble towards it. I stumble towards it. And I guilty I may be. But don't give up on me. In the wake of the Odyssey. We will still be thick as thieves. You and me still thick as thieves. Evidently this is my mistake. Lost touch but I think I've been replaced. Evidently something's gotta give. Play it safe, but I know you're worth the risk. You built this portrait. I stumble towards it. I stumble towards it. And I guilty I may be. But don't give up on me. In the wake of the Odyssey. We will still be thick as thieves. You and me still thick as thieves. I got an escape if you want it. We can leave first thing in the morning. We'll be back before you know. We're as thick as thieves. And I guilty I may be. But don't give up on me.

through the ghost,Speak of the Devil. look who just walked into the room. The guilted and faded notion. of someone I once knew. All the perfect moments are wrong. All the precious pieces are gone. Everything that mattered is just. A city of dust. Covering both of us. Did you hide yourself away. I can't see you anymore. Did you eclipse another day. I used to wake up to the color of your soul. Did you hide yourself away. Are you living through the ghost. Did you finally find a place. Above the shadows so the world will never know. The world will never know you like I do. So many silent sorrows. you'll never hear from again. Now that you've lost tomorrow. is yesterday still a friend. All the bridges we built are burned. Not single lesson was learned. Everything that mattered is just. A city of dust. Covering both of us. Did you hide yourself away. I can't see you anymore. Did you eclipse another day. I used to wake up to the color of your soul. Did you hide yourself away. Are you living through the ghost. Did you finally find a place. Above the shadows so the world will never know. The world will never know you like I do. like I still do. Did you hide yourself away. I can't see you anymore. Did you eclipse another day. I used to wake up to the color of your soul. Did you hide yourself away. Are you living through the ghost. Did you finally find a place. Above the shadows so the world will never know. The world will never know you like I do
trade yourself in,"Deal with me. Don't even think about leaving yet. I'm not a part of some false regret. Even though I believe in fables. Come reset. A part of life that you'd soon forget. And maybe think about who you hurt. In the process. I don't think they know, that's my heart exposed. From the fearing of the endless lies. Trade yourself in for the perfect one. No one needs to know that you feel you've been ruined. Trade yourself in for diamond eyes. Watch the stars collide as you're lifted from your burden. You see me. And you know I am not the same. Can't pretend to just fake a smile. Cause you know I feel every ounce of. Pain combined. With the loss of a youthful mind. You need to look at what you've become. And try to figure out where you came from. I don't think they know, that's my heart exposed. From the fearing of the endless lies. Trade yourself in for the perfect one. No one needs to know that you feel you've been ruined. Trade yourself in for diamond eyes. Watch the stars collide as you're lifted from your burden. I know you can't feel a thing. It hurts to feel anymore. Trade yourself in for the perfect one. No one needs to know that you feel you've been ruined. Trade yourself in for diamond eyes. Watch the stars collide as you're lifted from your burden. Trade yourself in for the perfect one. No one needs to know that you feel you've been ruined. Trade yourself in for diamond eyes. Watch the stars collide as you're lifted from your burden. By Carol Maphoter"
unity,"I found a note with your name and a picture of us. Even though it was framed and covered in dust. It's the map in my mind that sends me on my way. They say it's never too late to stop being afraid. And there's no one else here. So why should I wait?. And in the blink of an eye, the past begins to fade. So have you ever been caught in a sea of dispair. And your moment of truth is the day that you say ""I'm not scared"". Put your hands in the air if you hear me out there. I've been looking for you day and night. Shine a light in the dark. Let me see where you are. Cuz I'm not gonna leave you behind. If I told you that you're not alone. And I show you this is where you belong. Put your hands in the air. One more time. I've seen a million miles met a million faces. It took all I knew. To reach all these places. And I'd do it again. If it brings me back to you. So have you ever been caught in a sea of dispair. And your moment of truth is the day that you say ""I'm not scared"". Put your hands in the air if you hear me out there. I've been looking for you day and night. Shine a light in the dark. Let me see where you are. Cuz I'm not gonna leave you behind. If I told you that you're not alone. And I show you this is where you belong. Put your hands in the air. One more time. Put your hands in the air. Put your hands in the air if you hear me out there. I've been looking for you day and night. Shine a light in the dark. Let me see where you are. Cuz I'm not gonna leave you behind. If I told you that you're not alone. And I show you this is where you belong. Put your hands in the air. One more time. Put your hands in the air. One more time."
what a shame,"Two packs of cigarettes a day. The strongest whiskey. Kentucky can make. That's a recipe to put a vagabond. On his hands and knees. I watched it all up close,. I knew him more than most. I saw a side of him he never showed. Full of sympathy for a world that. Wouldn't let him be. That's the man he was,. Have you heard enough?. What a shame, what a shame,. To judge a life that you can't change. The choir sings, the church bells ring. So, won't you give this man his wings?. What a shame to have to beg you to. See we're not all the same. What a shame. There's a hard life for. every silver spoon. There's a touch of grey for every shade Of blue. That's the way that I see life. If there was nothing wrong,. Then there'd be nothing right. And for this working man they say could. Barely stand. There's gotta be a better place to land. Some kind of remedy for a world that. Wouldn't let him be. That's the man he was,. Have you heard enough?. What a shame, what a shame,. To judge a life that you can't change. The choir sings, the church bells ring. So, won't you give this man his wings?. What a shame to have to beg you to. See we're not all the same. What a shame. God forgive the hands that laid you down. They never knew how, but your broken. Heart can break the sound. And change the season. Now the leaves are falling faster,. Happily ever after. You gave me hope through your endeavors. And now you will live forever. What a shame, what a shame,. To judge a life that you can't change. The choir sings, the church bells ring. So, won't you give this man his wings?. What a shame to have to beg you to. See we're not all the same. What a shame, what a shame. 'Cause we're not all the same. What a shame, what a shame. 'Cause we're not all the same"
