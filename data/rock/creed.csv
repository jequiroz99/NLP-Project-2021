higher,"When dreaming I'm guided through another world. Time and time again. At sunrise I fight to stay asleep. 'cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place.

To a place where blind men see. Can you take me higher?. To a place with golden streets. Although I would like our world to change. It helps me to appreciate. Those nights and those dreams.

my own prison,"A court is in session, a verdict is in. No appeal on the docket today. Just my own sin. The walls are cold and pale. The cage made of steel. Screams fill the room. Alone I drop and kneel. Silence now the sound. My breath the only motion around. Demons cluttering around. My face showing no emotion. Shackled by my sentence. Expecting no return. Here there is no penance. My skin begins to burn. (And I said, Oh). So I held my head up high. Hiding hate that burns inside. Which only fuels their selfish pride. (And I said, Oh). We're all held captive. Out from the sun. A sun that shines on only some. We the meek are all in one. I hear a thunder in the distance. See a vision of a cross. I feel the pain that was given. On that sad day of loss. A lion roars in the darkness. Only He holds the key. A light to free me from my burden. And grant me life eternally. Should have been dead. On a Sunday morning. Banging my head. No time for mourning. Ain't got no time. Should have been dead. On a Sunday morning. Banging my head. No time for mourning. Ain't got no time. (And I said, Oh). So I held my head up high. Hiding hate that burns inside. Which only fuels their selfish pride. (And I said, Oh). We're all held captive. Out from the sun. A sun that shines on only some. We the meek are all in one. I cry out to God. Seeking only His decision. Gabriel stands and confirms. I've created my own prison. I cry out to God. Seeking only His decision. Gabriel stands and confirms. I've created my own prison. (And I said, Oh). So I held my head up high. Hiding hate that burns inside. Which only fuels their selfish pride. (And I said, Oh).

what if,I can't find the rhyme in all my reason. Lost sense of time and all seasons. Feel I've been beaten down. By the words of men who have no grounds. Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom. When your ax has cut the roots that feed them. Forked tongues in bitter mouths. Can drive a man to bleed from inside out. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine. Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind. Human pride sings a vengeful song. Inspired by the times you've been walked on. My stage is shared by many millions. Who lift their hands up high because they feel this. We are one We are strong. The more you hold us down the more we press on. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. [Guitar Break]. I know I can't hold the hate inside my mind. 'Cause what consumes your thoughts. controls your life. So I'll just ask a question. An only simple question. I'll just ask one question. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?.

just fine,Nothing is forever. And good things never last. And learning in the future. Is based on lessons from the past. I thought we were gold in the fire. And we could not be burned.

What I thought I'd found. Was too good to last. And your love it was a promise made. But our lock and key. Held a broken chain. And now when I see you. I don't understand. And all I needed from you then. Has now become all the time on my hands. It was torture to see it comin'. As we reached the end of days. The sands of time were fallin'. From a premature heart decay. And as I stood in falsehood. In our final hour. I prayed for the roots of a redwood. But you withered like a flower. And when you finally spoke. The words that broke my heart. I couldn't blame you too much. Cause I knew from the start. And your love it was an hourglass. What I thought I'd found. Was too good to last. And your love it was a promise made. But our lock and key. Held a broken chain. And now when I see you. I don't understand. And all I needed from you then. Has now become all the time on my hands. And your love it was an hourglass.

my own prison,"A court is in session, a verdict is in. No appeal on the docket today. Just my own sin. The walls are cold and pale. The cage made of steel. Screams fill the room. Alone I drop and kneel. Silence now the sound. My breath the only motion around. Demons cluttering around. My face showing no emotion. Shackled by my sentence. Expecting no return. Here there is no penance. My skin begins to burn. (And I said, Oh). So I held my head up high. Hiding hate that burns inside. Which only fuels their selfish pride. (And I said, Oh). We're all held captive. Out from the sun. A sun that shines on only some. We the meek are all in one. I hear a thunder in the distance. See a vision of a cross. I feel the pain that was given. On that sad day of loss. A lion roars in the darkness. Only He holds the key. A light to free me from my burden. And grant me life eternally. Should have been dead. On a Sunday morning. Banging my head. No time for mourning. Ain't got no time. Should have been dead. On a Sunday morning. Banging my head. No time for mourning. Ain't got no time. (And I said, Oh). So I held my head up high. Hiding hate that burns inside. Which only fuels their selfish pride. (And I said, Oh). We're all held captive. Out from the sun. A sun that shines on only some. We the meek are all in one. I cry out to God. Seeking only His decision. Gabriel stands and confirms. I've created my own prison. I cry out to God. Seeking only His decision.

never die,"Hands on a window pane. Watching some children laugh and play. They're running in circles. With candy canes and French braids. Inspired to question. What makes us grownups, anyway?. Let's search for the moment. When youth betrayed itself to age. So, let the children play. Inside your heart always. And death you will defy. 'Cause your youth will never die, never die. In searching for substance. We're clouded by struggle's haze. Remember the meaning. Of playing out in the rain. We swim in the fountain. Of youth's timeless maze. If you drink the water. Your youth will never fade. So, let the children play. Inside your heart always. And death you will defy. 'Cause your youth will never die. Never die, never die, never die. I won't let go of that youthful soul. Despite body and mind. My youth will never die. I won't let go of that youthful soul. Despite body and mind. My youth will never die. So, let the children play.

ode,"Hang me, watch awhile. Let me see you smile, as I die. Take me, as my body burns. Let me see you yearn, while I cry. One step on your own. And you walk all over me. One head in the clouds. You won't let go. You're too proud. One light to the blind, and they see. One touch on the head, we believe. Adore me as I drift away. Let me hear you say I'm fine. You cry as my body dies. All that you despised is gone away. One step on your own. And you walk all over me. One head in the clouds. You won't let go. You're too proud. One light to the blind, and they see. One touch on the head, we believe. We believe"

one,"Affirmative may be justified. Take from one give to another. The goal is to be unified. Take my hand be my brother. The payment silenced the masses. Sanctified by oppression.

Believe what you will. That is your right. But I choose to win. I choose to fight. To fight. Cause me... I'm rusted and weathered. Barely holding together. I'm covered with skin that peels and it just won't heal. I'm rusted and weathered. Barely holdin together. I'm covered with skin that peels and it just won't. Covered with skin that peels and it just won't. Covered with skin that peels and it just won't heal"
what if,I can't find the rhyme in all my reason. Lost sense of time and all seasons. Feel I've been beaten down. By the words of men who have no grounds. Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom. When your ax has cut the roots that feed them. Forked tongues in bitter mouths. Can drive a man to bleed from inside out. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine. Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind. Human pride sings a vengeful song. Inspired by the times you've been walked on. My stage is shared by many millions. Who lift their hands up high because they feel this. We are one We are strong. The more you hold us down the more we press on. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. [Guitar Break]. I know I can't hold the hate inside my mind. 'Cause what consumes your thoughts. controls your life. So I'll just ask a question. An only simple question. I'll just ask one question. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if you did?. What if you lied?. What if I avenge?. What if eye for an eye?. What if your words could be judged like a crime?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?. What if? What if?. What if? What if?. What If I?
what's this life for?,"Hurray for a child. That makes it through. If there's any way. Because the answer lies in you. They're laid to rest. Before they've known just what to do. Their souls are lost. Because they could never find. What's this life for.... I see your soul, it's kind of gray. You see my heart, you look away. You see my wrist, I know your pain. I know your purpose on your plane. Don't say a last prayer. Because you could never find. What's this life for. But they ain't here anymore. Don't have to settle the score. Cause we all live. Under the reign of one king. But they ain't here anymore. Don't have to settle no goddamn score. Cause we all live. Under the reign, I said you know, of one king. But they ain't here anymore. Don't have to settle no goddamn score. Cause we all live. Under the reign, I said you know, of one king. But they ain't here anymore. Don't have to settle no goddamn score. Cause we all live. Under the reign of one king"
who's got my back?,Run hide. All that was sacred to us. Sacred to us. See the signs. The covenant has been broken. By mankind. Leaving us with no shoulder...with no shoulder. To rest our head on. To rest our head on. To rest our head on. Who's got my back now?. When all we have left is deceptive. So disconnected. So what is the truth now?. There's still time. All that has been devastated. Can be recreated. Realize. We pick up the broken pieces. Of our lives. Giving ourselves to each other..ourselves to each other. To rest our head on. To rest our head on. To rest our head on. Who's got my back now?. When all we have left is deceptive. So disconnected. So what is the truth now?. What is the truth now?. Tell me the truth now?. Who's got my back now?. When all we have left is deceptive. So disconnected. So what is the truth now?

Under the sunlight. Welcome to this place. I'll show you everything. With arms wide open. With arms wide open. Well I don't know if I'm ready. To be the man I have to be.

wrong way,"What makes you touch?. What makes you feel?. What makes you stop and smell the roses in an open field?. What makes you unclean?. Yeah, Yeah. What makes you laugh?. What makes you cry?. What makes our youth run. From the thought that we might die?. What makes you bleed?. Somebody told me the wrong way. What if I died?. What did I give?. I hope it was an answer so you might live. I hope I helped you live. I hope I helped you live. Somebody told me the wrong way"
young grow old,"He said he's falling to pieces. Fighting the boy and the man. Over his shoulder there was freedom. But consciousness has tied his hands. Embodied youth was his distinction. Now inhibition's in demand. So driven by his fear of weakness. That's his key to understand. So far in a distant land. There's a fight between boy and man. See the light through the open door. Sit and watch as the young grow old. Trading places in the circle. Turn the glass, spill the sand. They say that time can make the difference. But age doesn't make you a man. So far in a distant land. There's a fight between boy and man. See the light through the open door. Sit and watch as the young grow old. So young but overblown. So young but overblown. So young but overblown. Take a look now, see the boy is weakened. Watch him fade, watch him fade away. Take a bow and the boy is defeated. Is this the way, this the way?. So far in a distant land. There's a fight between boy and man. See the light through the open door. Sit and watch as the young grow old."
