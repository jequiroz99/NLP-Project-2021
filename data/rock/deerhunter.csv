sleepwalking,"I'm not mad about anything. You forced on me a hopeless dream. I'd been looking for one true thing. Too numb to see I'd been sleepwalking. Too horrified to see. When a decade doesn't get you down. You're flying now but you'll come back down. And with both your feet on the ground. You'll look around, yeah, you'll look around. Too horrified to see. I'd been looking for some harmonies. Some words to sing that could really bring. The lonely-hearted some company. All the people that were just like me, yeah. When a decade is spent searching. For something time will never bring. Something starts to shut down inside. My body and my tired mind. Too horrified to see. Can't you see. Your heart is hard now. Your heart is hard now. Can't you see. We've grown apart now. We've grown apart now"
t.h.m.,"I tried to keep him straight. Ever since the day he was born. He came out a little late. Maybe that's where frustration's born. My head was like a wound. When they called me and said. ""it's happened much too soon"". Took two bullets to the brain. My kid brother, he was insane. Was insane. When you find a way. Call and tell me when the time's erased. I had no cause to be awake. The phone rang, it was 3am. Oh it was T. H. M. Where is T. H. M?. Ever since I was born. I have felt so forlorn. I always knew this day would come. Hey you lose and you win some. T. H. M. T. H. M. T. H. M. T. H. M"

the missing,Open up my thoughts. Tell me if you see. Some meaning. Oh take me all apart. Oh so that I can see. The pieces. And I could walk for miles. And on every street's. The same scene. Follow the telephone wire. Until I feel there's air. Beneath me. Oh if you don't mind. Would you show to me. The missing?. Oh with my weak eyes. I will only see. The missing. Open up my heart. Tell me if you see. Some meaning. Oh take me all apart. So that I can see. The bleeding. Oh if you don't mind. Could you show to me. The missing?. Oh with my weak eyes. I will only see. The missing. The missing. The missing. The missing. The missing. The missing. And I would understand. (I would understand). If you showed to me. The missing. And I could understand. (I could understand). If you showed to me. The missing. And I would understand. (I'd understand). If you showed to me. The missing
twilight at carbon lake,"Go to the shore and, pray for the sea.. Go towards the mirror and, pray that you'll see,. Someone else.. Downtown, go downtown.. Go to the waves of grain in the center of the state.. Go away.. Go to a parking lot,. sit on the ground, and cry.. You'll never know why.. Start over.. Go to the ocean on a ship.. Wave goodbye to the waves. and the frozen shit. that was in your heart.. So long. Time slows when it goes away. Go away. Time Slows. So long"

what happens to people?,"What happens to people?. Their lives up in arms. What happens to people?. They quit holding on. What happens to people. And what can they do?. They're only returning. The powers of youth. What happens to people?. What happened to you?. What happens to people?. They fade out of view. I can't remember your face. It's lost to me. It's lost to me. Now it's ending. The wounds remain. Unpaved, unpaved. What happens to people?. They quit holding on. What happens to people?. Their dreams turn to dark. The rust in your castle. You're trying to fail.
