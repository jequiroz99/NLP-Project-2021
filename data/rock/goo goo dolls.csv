Sit right down. I got time. And you say here comes the end. And you haven't got a friend. And I'm standing here just screaming at the wall. Up yours. Stop your whine. What ya got. I got mine. And you shake your stupid head. And you wish that you were dead. And I swear sometimes you're happier than me. And you know it's hard to be. All the things you want me to be. And you go and make it hard on me. But I swear that anything you could be I could be can't you see. Up yours. Got no mind. That's too bad. You got time. Yeah, fuck your silly game.

dizzy,You're cynical and beautiful. You always make a scene. You're monochrome delerious. You're nothing that you seem. I'm drowning in your vanity. You're laugh is a disease. You're dirty and you're sweet. You know you're everything to me. Chorus:. Everything you are. Falls from the sky like a star. Everything you are. What ever ever you want. I wanna kick at the machine. That made you piss away your dreams. And tear at your defenses. Till there's nothing there but me. You're angry when your beautiful. Your love is such tease. I'm drowning in your dizzy noise. I wanna feel you scream. Chorus
(i wont tell 'em your) name,"And even though the moment passed me by. I still can't turn away. 'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose. Got tossed along the way. And letters that you never meant to send. Get lost or thrown away. . And now we're grown up orphans. That never knew their names. We don't belong to no one. That's a shame. But if you could hide beside me. Maybe for a while. And I won't tell no one your name. And I won't tell em' your name. . And scars are souvenirs you never lose. The past is never far. Did you lose yourself somewhere out there. Did you get to be a star. And don't it make you sad to know that life. Is more than who we are. . We grew up way too fast. And now there's nothing to believe. Reruns all become our history. A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio. And I won't tell no one your name. And I won't tell em' your name. I won't tell em' your name. Mmm, mmm, mmm,. I won't tell em' your nameâ¦ Ow!. . I think about you all the time. But I don't need to sing. It's lonely where you are come back down,. And I won't tell em your name."
a thousand words,"A thousand words that no one's spoken. Now there's nothing left to say. Another dream just got broken. You suggest you're not that way, yeah. I want you to love me. Want you to know I'm just like you. Just like you. Another dream just got broken. Another dreamer just like you. You. A thousand words just like you. A thousand words just like you.

acoustic #3,No one's listening. They painted up your secrets. With the lies they told to you. And the least they ever gave you. Was the most you ever knew. And I wonder where these dreams go. When the world gets in your way. What's the point in all this screaming. No one's listening anyway. Your voice is small and fading. And you hide in here unknown. And your mother loves your father. 'Cause she's got nowhere to go. And she wonders where these dreams go. 'Cause the world got in her way. What's the point in ever trying. Nothing's changing anyway. They press their lips against you. And you love the lies they say. And I tried so hard to reach you. But you're falling anyway. And you know I see right through you. Cause the world gets in your way. What's the point in all this screamin'. You're not listening anyway
ain't that unusual,"Could you talk to me. Honestly. Cause I never heard a word you said now. And I ain't just being mean. Cause all we are is what we're told. And most of that's been lies. It's like a made for TV movie. And I just blew my line. Someday you never made it. and maybe it never will. Hey, you never made it. Ain't that unusual. Now I feel unknown. And it's safe that way. Are you too bored to care or too dumb to be scared now. What's that supposed to mean. I'm burned out on some empty reasons. Another waste of time. There's somethin' that I wish I'd said. But I don't think it'd rhyme. Someday you never made it. and maybe it never will. Hey, you never made it. And ain't that unusual. See I'd love to be you. At least then I'd see you. Sorry I put them words in your mouth. But you wouldn't talk to me. And everyhing, I want haven't got. I'm sick of everything now I'm not. I put my heavy coat on for a while. It's freezing in the corner of my mind. Someday you never made it. and maybe it never will. Hey, you never made it. Ain't that unusual?."
all eyes on me,Daylight burns your sleepy eyes. It's hard to see you dreaming. You hide inside yourself. I wondered what you're thinkin'. And everything you're chasing. It seems to leave you empty. And it won't take long to burn. All eyes on me. Through the nothing that you've learned. All eyes on me. And the things you choose to be. All eyes on me. But your eyes look away. It's so hard to be someone. Strung out from today. And all that you knew slips away. You drown in deeper oceans. Inventing new religions. They smile and stab my back and. I lie and have to laugh. And it won't take long to burn. All eyes on me. Through the nothing that you've learned. All eyes on me. And the things you choose to be. All eyes on me. But your eyes look away. It's so hard to be someone. Strung out from today. And all that you knew slips away. And you hid in your room. And the light burns away. And you move from the truth. It's all so far from you.
all that you are,"And I feel,. All the faint morning light,. Filled with hope. 'cause you're here in my life,. And we've gone,. From the edge of our souls,. Made it back to a place we call home.. You, see me through,. I was alone in the dark and the fear was my truth.. Yeah, all the things that you are,. Beautifully broken, alive in my heart,. And know that you are everything,. Let your heart sing and tonight,. We light up the stars,. All that you are.. I feel wrong,. I'm so human and flawed,. I break down even though I'm still strong,. And time, will make fools of us all,. Builds us up, and then laughs when we fall.. You, pull me through,. When I'm alone in the dark. And the fear was my truth.. Yeah, all the things that you are,. Beautifully broken, alive in my heart,. And know that you are everything,. Let your heart sing and tonight,. We light up the stars,. All that you are.. You're the sound of redemption,. The faith that I've lost,. The answers I'm seeking no matter the cost,. You opened the window,. Now I can see,. And you taught me forgiveness. By giving your love back to me.. Yeah, all the things that you are,. Beautifully broken, alive in my heart,. And know that you are everything,. Let your heart sing and tonight,. We light up the stars,. All that you are.. Yeah, all the things that you are,. Beautifully broken, alive in my heart,. And know that you are everything,. Let your heart sing and tonight,. Let your heart sing and tonight, we light up the stars,. All that you are.. Oh I feel,.

already there,"I look outside my window. Everything was blanketed in white. The neighbors pushing cars out. From snow that fell on us last night. Started thinking bout. The things we used to do when we were young. Back when things were simple. And getting up was fun. I couldn't care cause I'm already there. Turn around and face the clock. I'd sit and watch, as time went hopping by. I'm still growing up. My friends are growing old before my eyes. Count the stars above. Wonder when the heavens will subside. Knowing our two worlds. Will someday just collide. I couldn't care cause I'm already there.. Just a boy who's young at heart. His smile was a bit like yours today. Had a wife a kid some strife. Never had to go astray. Happiness abounds. Life was in full swing. At seventeen all the things he wanted. Were things he'd never see. It don't seem fair cause I'm already there."
always know where you are,"It's good to see the sun and feel this place,. This place I never thought would feel like home.. And I ran forever;. Far away and I always thought I'd end up here alone.. Somehow the world has changed me.. I've come home,. To give back the things they took from you.. And I feel you now,. I'm not alone,. I'll always know where you are.. When I see myself, I'll always know where you are,. Where you are.. And I found something that was always there,. Sometimes it's got to hurt before you feel,. But now I'm strong and I won't kneel,. Except to thank who's watching over me.. But somehow I feel so stong.. And I've begun,. To be the one I never thought I'd be.. And I feel you now,. I'm not alone,. I'll always know where you are.. And when I see myself, I'll always know where you are,. Where you are.. Now, it's all so clear,. And I believe that everything's been looking good to me.. And I feel you now,. I'm not alone.. I'll always know, I'll always know where you are.. When I see myself, I'll always know where you are.. When I feel the sun, I'll always know where you are.. When I see myself, I'll always know where you are,. Where you are."
american girl (tom petty cover),"Well, she was an American girl,. Raised on promises. She couldn't help thinking that there was a little. more to life. Somewhere else. After all it was a great big world. With lots of places to run to. And if she had to die. Tryin', she. Had one little promise she was gonna keep. (Chorus:). Oh yeah, alright,. Take it easy, baby. Make it last all night. She was an American girl.. Well, it was kind of cold that night,. She stood alone on the balcony. Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,. Out on four forty one like. Waves crashing on the beach,. And for one des'rate moment there. He crept back in her memory. God, it's so painful when something that's so close. Is still so far out of reach"

Is it to call and tell you to be strong. Are you alive. Amigone (...Miracles gone wrong). Was the poison in our love there all along. Amigone. Heavenly intoxication. Love's been marred by medication.

Amigone (...Miracles gone wrong). Is it too late to face the truth that it was wrong. Amigone. I'm not sayin' that it's something. I'm not gonna play along. I'm not wishin' for a miracle.

another second time around,"Happy, smilin', cryin' outburst to my past. I guess those stormy gray skies simply couldn't last. And now I find myself a-tugging at your dress. The fun of holding you down, or seein' you frown, it's never gonna pass. Somewhere there's a place a soul can never go. Gray like stormy skies I hoped you didn't know. All our postcards full of things I won't forget. And now it's coming down, that laughing clown is all I ever get. Another second time around I've been runnin' from ya. Another second time around. Another second, one more second time I waited for ya. Another second time around. Couldn't help myself. I felt like everything was gonna pass. It was an awkward time. I hoped it wouldn't, hoped it couldn't last. And I didn't know exactly what to say. About the things you saw me do my evil way. And I know you're lyin', cryin' in your bed. Well I'm all tired out, so wired now, it's ringing in my head. Another second time around I've been runnin' from ya. Another second time around. Another second, one more second time I waited for ya. Another second time around. Another second time around. Another second time around"

can't let it go,You said you'd light a candle. And you'd say a prayer for me. I feel the light has dimmed and gone. Half the world is begging. While the other half steals. Where did everything go wrong?. Some days I can't believe. Others I'm on my knees. Trying to be heard. I was your anger. And you were my fear. Now that it's over. Of course it's so clear. But you were no angel. And I was no sin. Somehow I can't let you go. I can't let you go again. And half the world is sleeping. While the other half dreams. You close your eyes. And then you're gone. And maybe my intentions. Have been misunderstood. I know you feel so beautifully wronged. Some days I can't believe. Others I'm on my knees. Hoping I belong. I was your anger. And you were my fear. Now that it's over. Of course it's so clear. But you were no angel. And I was no sin. Somehow I can't let you go. I can't let you go again. And laughter is my soul's release. But we're not smiling anymore. Can't we try to win this peace. 'Cause we're never gonna win. Never gonna win this war. I was your anger. And you were my fear. Now that it's over. Of course it's so clear. But you were no angel. And I was no sin. Somehow I can't let you go. I can't let you go again

close your eyes,I wish I had a saxophone. I'd play the blues til you came home. With a little sadness in your eye. Now that all my time was spent. In you walked you're heaven sent. Thinking 'bout all the nights you cried. Had a certain passion. And I had silly dreams. All of the vicious actions. Don't close your eyes to me. I wish I had a camera lens. To film the things my mind had said. Before they reached my mouth and got all bent. Looking up the skies of blue. All day long I think of you. Even after all the shit we've been through. Had a certain passion. And I had silly dreams. All of the vicious actions. Don't close your eyes to me.

That made you piss away your dreams. And tear at your defenses. Till there's nothing there but me. You're angry when your beautiful. Your love is such tease. I'm drowning in your dizzy noise.

do you believe in him?,"(vocals by Lance Diamond). 'Twas the night before Christmas. And all through the house. By the color TV. Here asleep on the couch. All cozy and warm. With a dream for the light. Inside it's safe. On a cold Christmas night. Do You believe in him?. I don't know how long it's been. Do you believe in him?. All you got to do is let him in. All you got to do is let him in. 'Twas the night before Christmas. And out on the street. Through the window the snow such a holiday treat. Outside the trees and the cars in the back. Are perfectly dressed for a wine when it's time. Do You believe in him?. I don't know how long it's been. Do you believe in him?. All you got to do is let him in. All you got to do is let him in. 'Twas the night before Xmas. A man sleeps alone. Out in the cold cause he ain't got a home. Give him a hand, give him a share. Let's give him a smile. Instead of a stare. Do You believe in him?. I don't know how long it's been. Do you believe in him?. All you got to do is let him in. All you got to do is let him in."

I borrowed from you yesterday. Lent a bunch to you last may. No one minds I can tell. Seems I've picked the wrong seashell but. Here comes the day, I sit and wait. Oh it's always something. The bills keep coming, the car ain't running. Now I'm coming home again. Another day, the mailman's on his way. Just sit and wait. Always pondering my fate too late. Another day goes.

I wanna rule the world wanna swallow it whole. At least I could kick it all down. I wanna kick it all down. Eyes wide open I can't see. Eyes wide open what you mean. Eyes wide open I can't seem to be. I don't take the bus and I never walk too far. The furthest I got was my own backyard. With a fist full of cash that somebody else earned.

feel the silence,You lie awake at night. With blue eyes that never cry. All you remember now. Is what you feel. The truth remains. In midnight conversations. I asked for this moment. But you turned away. Sad like a lonely child. Broken the day you're born. I held the light to you. But I was so vain. And you remain. A promise unfulfilled. I ask you for more. But you push me away. And if we feel the silence. Holding this all inside. Everything means more now than. Words could explain. And if we feel the silence. Holding this all inside us. Looking for something more to say. I don't know where I'm going. Only know where I been. But you move through my soul like a hurricane wind. We've been so lost for so long. I don't know how to get back again. And we're drowning in the water. That flows under this bridge. When you're fighting the current. You forget how to live. And I wanted to reach you but I don't know where to begin. And you remain. A promise unfulfilled until today. And if we feel the silence. Holding this all inside. Everything means more now than. Words could explain. And if we feel the silence. Leaving this all behind us. When it's gone what will you say. How do we hold on. How do we hold on. How do we hold on. How do we hold on. How do we hold on. You lie awake at night. With blue eyes that never cry
flat top,Flat top intervention. Bringing home the new invention. See it there in pieces on the ground. A television war between the cynics and the saints. Flip the dial and that's whose side you're on. Sleeping on the white house lawn ain't never changed a thing. Look at all the washed out hippie dreams. And it's falling all around us. Is this some kind of joke they're trying to pull on us?. Falling all around us. I'll turn my head off for a while. Tabloid generation's lost. Choking on it's fear. Used to be that's all we had to fear. conscience keeps us quiet while the crooked love to speak. There's knowledge wrapped in blankets on the streets. A visionary coward says that anger can be power. As long as there's a victim on tv. And it's falling all around us. Is this some kind of joke they're trying to pull on us. Falling all around us. I'll turn my head off for a while. And my dirty dreams all come alive. On my TV screen. And assassination plots. Show me what I haven't got. Show me what I love and who I'm supposed to be. Show me everything I need. Show it all to me. And it's falling all around us. Is this some kind of joke they're trying to pull on us?. Falling all around us. I'll turn my head off for a while.

Will this neverland. Free me from its clutching hand. It won't release me. And I've gone underground. Obsessions I have found. Couldn't make it back again. Why can't the moon stay full forever. Wednesday's bad but Friday's ain't much better. (Someone's hell). Why can't the moon stay full forever. Right now she's got nothin' on her mind.

Where he sits and waits for me. There's a wall of confusion building. And the sky begins to bleed on me. Don't fall asleep to dream. I'm looking for a way out now. Peace of mind is all I need. Don't fall asleep to dream. I'm awake now. (You can't touch me, I won't sleep no more). Awake now. (You can't touch me, I won't sleep no more). Awake now. (You can't touch me, I won't sleep no more).

if the world turned upside down,"I ignored the beat inside my heart for too long. I had accepted what was right, but always felt wrong. It's a second-hand of time I've been a slave to. But inside there was a feeling, something I always knew. If the world turned upside down. If the sky changed places with the ground. All the whispers, all that's possible, be clear and loud. If the world turned upside down. When the road ahead just goes in one direction. And for every word you write there's contradiction. When the inner voice of reason is full of doubt. What's the point in fitting in. if you're designed to stand out. If the world turned upside down. If the sky changed places with the ground. All the whispers, all that's possible, be clear and loud. If the world turned upside down. I just wanna be free from limitations and rules. Imagine the space, where I could create. Imagine the look on their faces. If the world turned upside down. And the earth and sky changed around. If there'd be, if we walk in the stars. But do I everything, we're told we can. If we think and feel we could shout and loud. If the world turned upside down. If the world turned upside down"
impersonality,When I was three feet tall. I loved them all. And lived life for myself. Falling down for laughs. Your photograph. Some puppets made of felt. Watching life in Oz Thanksgiving eve on grandma's old TV. Dancing roundabout I'd twist and shout for everyone to see. Impersonality. It's leaning hard on me. Momma's in a shop. Watching little sister by myself. Robbed a wishing pond. In a fleeting bond. Vowed to share the wealth. Scooping up the coins. A warning shot from some authority. Doesn't matter now but I'll shout out loud for everyone to see. Never got to know you. Did you ever wonder why. Now it's nice to know you. And I'm glad you're doing fine. Think of all the time lost. Was it really lost at all. Now I'm so proud of ya. I'd love to tell you all I see. Listen hard to your realities. Impersonality. It's leaning hard on me.
iris,And I'd give up forever to touch you. Cause I know that you feel me somehow. You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be. And I don't want to go home right now. And all I can taste is this moment. And all I can breathe is your life. Cause sooner or later it's over. I just don't want to miss you tonight. And I don't want the world to see me. Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken. I just want you to know who I am. And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming. Or the moment of truth in your lies. When everything feels like the movies. Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive. And I don't want the world to see me. Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken. I just want you to know who I am. (break and solo). And I don't want the world to see me. 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken. I just want you to know who I am. And I don't want the world to see me. 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken.

we are the normal,It's a beautiful day I heard everybody say. The sun shines down for all of us. Just the same you know I like the rain. That ain't so obvious. It's a beautiful sight I guess everybody's right. This day belongs to all of us. Even still I like with a chill. That ain't so obvious. We are the normal. We live and we die. With no reason why. It's a beautiful life and I've got it in my sights. And that ain't for all of us. It's a beautiful sound. My life comes crashing down. That ain't so obvious.

what a scene,(John Rzeznik). When you're feeling all wrong in the back of your mind again. How does it feel. When you drop down everything's all the same. Saccharine caffeine nicotine gum. Yeah it tastes sweet but it's not for long. And I just think you thought it would be. When you're looking for truth on the cover of a magazine. How does it feel. When you find out what you're not gonna be. They give you your image and the things you believe. Open your eyes tell me what did you see. And I just think you thought it surreal. How does it feel when you're out on your own. And now it's too late to come home. And it's hard to be free when you're down on your knees. Take it easy til you make it alone. Now you're a supermarket punk rock television comedy. Out on the scene. Yeah I bit down now there's no hand to feed. And all the beautiful images lining your walls. Pop radio screaming down the halls. Now you think you found something real. When it's all about money and the things that you need. Live a big lie and they all believe. Now I just find that somehow obscene. How does it feel when you're out on your own. And now it's too late to come home. And it's hard to be free when you're down on your knees. Take it easy til you make it alone. Take it easy til you make it alone. What a scene. Yeah. When it's all been said before. And all been done. Take it easy till you make it alone. Take it easy til you make it alone. Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah...etc. Lies weigh more than truth. Innocence looks good on you. Now everybody wants to know your name.
what do you need?,"What do you need from me tonight?. I feel you look right through me now. I can't pretend it's all right. Maybe we'll find a way somehow. Why do we need to turn it on?. Why does it always feel so wrong?. [Chorus]. What do you need from me tonight?. The truth is so complicated now. You feel so free to say. You're wrong, you're wrong. You're wrong, you're wrong. Fear makes you fragile darlin'. Hate is so heavy when you're weak. Now we're both lost in anger. When we're alone we'll find some peace. Why do we need to turn it on?. Why does it always seem so wrong?. What do you need from me tonight?. The truth is so complicated now. You feel so free to say. You're wrong, you're wrong. You're wrong, you're wrong.

I'll be there, you're not alone. I held your face in my hands. So I could feel you smile. Every time that I kiss you. You put your lips to my scars. Made a tattoo of stars. I felt the rush of blood and I knew. I never answer to. Anybody who. Tryna tear us down again. So take the angry words. Things that make you hurt. Kiss them goodbye, forever tonight. When the world breaks your heart. I can put it back together. Write your name across the sky. So I'm always with you. Now it's you and me. Like the stars we burn forever. So listen when I say to you. I'll be there, you're not alone. You're not alone. When the sun fades into shadows. When you call and no one's there. And the light goes out inside you. Don't you know that I'll be there. When the world breaks your heart. I can put it back together. Write your name across the sky. So I'm always with you. You're the only truth that I ever knew. Like the stars we burn forever. So listen when I say to you. I'll be there, you're not alone. When the sun turns into shadows. When you call and no one's there. And the lights go out inside you. I'll be there, you're not alone.

without you here,"Your love's a gathered storm. I chased across the sky. A moment in your arms became the reason why. And you're still the only light that fills the emptiness. The only one I need until my dying breath. And I would give you everything just to feel your open arms. And I'm not sure I believe anything I feel. And now, now that you're near. There's nothing more without you. Without you here. And I'm trying to believe. In things that I don't know. The turning of the world. The color of your soul. That love could kill the pain. Truth is never vain. It turns strangers into lovers. And enemies to brothers. Just say you understand. I never had this planned. And now, now that you're near. There's nothing more without you. Without you here. Without you here. There's nothing more without you. Without you here. My head lies to my heart. And my heart it still believes. It seems the ones who love us are the ones. That we deceive. But you're changing everything. You're changing everything in me. And now, now that you're near. There's nothing more without you. Without you here"
you know what i mean,"It's been a long, dark, lonely hall. Between the cracks I can read the scrawl. It's written down in a crooked rhyme. That sold me out before my time. You know but, since then I been back down to the edge. I can't believe the things you never said. I can't explain the words I never found. My whole world should come crashing down. You know, but you can't sell me out with everything you think about. I think back I draw a blank. You know but, there ain't no need to dig the past. You know I, I don't wanna live my life in a day. I ain't got no need for this plastic cage. 'Cause you don't think about anything I think about. You know what I mean. Now you know for sure you're alive. Because you watched her leave before your eyes. You know I'm afraid to say your name. But I ain't afraid to share this blame. Because, you can't sell me out everything you think about. You know what I mean. It's been a long, dark, lonely hall. Between the cracks I can read the scrawl. Find a place that feels like home. You know I, I get some clue to where I'm going. You know, you don't think about anything I think about. You know what I mean. You know what I mean, oh no. You know what I mean."
you never know,"Ya never know. Some folks think the world just moves too slow. But was it you. Who told me I'm your everything. (Chorus). You hit my like I never felt before. Hit me like a sucker punch, rotten to the core. You know you hit me like I've never felt before. Silly for the last time. You never take. A promise from a man who sheds his skin. You had to wait. For my aching heart to break. (Chorus). Oh, everyone gets angry. I feel it when you're holding me. But in the right place, at the right time, to the right degree. It's a breeding ground. For the pain I've found. From dealing with your scene. And you know that ain't easy. (Chorus)."
