break me out,I walked upon the earth alone. I was torn away. I have fallen. But never bow. Till the day arrives. I'll learn how to live. Dying but standing on my feet. For someone inside an empty dream. To find an exit takes lots of proving to do. I'll never forget. I saw it in your eyes. You gave me the fire. That would break me out. break me out. break me out. Just break me out. I left the rain. Erase my name. Because now the struggle has a face. My face unfoulds. It's all getting clear. Lightning the darkness that once set in. I closed my fists and held it high. Forgave what haunts me. This time is do it or die. I'll never forget. I saw it in your eyes. You gave me the fire. That would break me out. break me out. break me out. Just break me out. I'll never forget. I saw it in your eyes. You gave me the fire. That would break me out. break me out. break me out.

breakthrough,"When I lay down. Sun brings dawn. Pure than ever. It holds me in their arms. And I waited.... You may live on a raft. Always sailing. Your own lost way and now,. Just a melt of suffer and tears from all. ""Don't ever let me down"". Well, I guess somebody said.... Don't run away from where it rises. So they say the truth meant dawn.. (Chorus). Breaking all the waves. You rather live like your own hope. Drifting away. Caught up on the wrong road. Who may dream to be left?. Always sailing. Your own lost way just found. Compromising peace and years of love. ""Don't ever let me down"". Well, I guess somebody said.... Don't run away from where it rises. So they say the truth meant dawn.. (Chorus). Breaking all the waves. You rather live like your own hope. Drifting away. Caught up on the wrong road. Breaking all the waves. You rather live like your own hope. Drifting away. Caught up on the wrong road. And all your blame blind to see. This is real life, that is day and night. It's hard to know. What we lost for all those years. But we were young and. Free from the loneliness of mind. (Chorus). Breaking all the waves. You rather live like your own hope. Drifting away. Caught up on the wrong road. Breaking all the waves. You rather live like your own hope. Drifting away. Caught up on the wrong road. I make my own way"

fragile state of peace,"Your name is being called. We got a deal. We've got to put an end on this. Mom bleeds on her own. Young kids that will never going to grow. A country you won't trust. A small dream at the point of a gun. Honesty down to dust. Your greed just leaving all your sons. A sightseeing of the worst. Concrete blocking people from their love. It might be late. To regain take back what we've lost. How can we forgive. For all they've done. For all they've done to us?. I walk this long road. It's a cold day. I's hard to talk. I have this cold, cruel soul. And I can't believe. What I've become. Dead end, no return. Street seems to be killing all we've learned. Convicted is what we are. For neglecting the symptoms of this curse. Cold day, it's hard to walk. Behold while the city is left to burn. Drunk on fallacies. Sold faith for a buck. When all hope went away. And left a hole in your will. You're all you got. You don't want to give it away. It might be late. To regain take back what we've lost. How can we forgive. For all they've done. All they've done to us?. I walk this long road. It's a cold day. It's hard to talk. I have this cold, cruel soul. And I can't believe. What I've become. You mean the whole world to me. But being left I can't let go. Do you need hearts just to break?. Do you know what went away?. An old man is alone. Hoping to be treated like one. He may not know. How many lives could it takes. I walk this long road. It's a cold day. It's hard to talk. I have this cold, cruel soul. And I can't believe. What I've become. Fragile state of those who hate. War remained when hope went away. Fragile state of those who hate. War remained when hope went away. Mom bleeds on her own. Dead end, no return. Do you know what went away?"

My senses points to you but you don’t follow me, don’t even see.. My memory’s calling you, I know the truth inside. When all doors are closed you gave up your hope ‘cause you rather believe in your eyes.. I can show you the way to forever, but to you forever bleeds!. I craw searching for you, your light does never shine,. You gave up your hope cause you’d rather believe in your eyes.. Watching over you I see he’s coming.

I try to read what’s between the lines of doubts on my shoulders,. It digs in my skin!. Among tricky options. Deal with it somehow. Wrong ways are going, don’t turn around.. Shine, through a cloudy night a view that pictures bye.. Shine, just the two of us, no one but me and them!. Though we all refuse to know somewhere else to be. Unable to hide, writing fate through me. The choice isn’t mine, unlock your mind!"

Let the devil know I'm in her house tonight. . (Refrão). I'm feeling the fall. The wind rides with me. Just turn the ignition off. This night belongs to me. You cannot stop me now. Turn the ignition off. . Stone thrown towards the surface. Sinking as the river flows. It's sinking down. I'm sinking down. An inner quest, a healing way of life. Keeps the fire urging up inside. Death and glory holding hands. . (Refrão). I'm feeling the fall. The wind rides with me. Just turn the ignition off. This night belongs to me. You cannot stop me now. Turn the ignition off. .

thousand miles from you,"I see a thousand miles through you,. From love to just unfinished clues.. You always showed me how to live,. Always showed me how to live.. Go on and take this pain of mine,. I promise I will end this and die.. You've always showed me how to live,. Still show me how to live.. Eyes closed to see,. What lies inside of me,. Easily, you're going to find in me, you.. A thousand miles from you, endless way home,. I navigate on seas unknown.. Leave me so I can move on,. Build strength on my own.. Another time brand new for me.. Starts, a movie in slow motion,. Frame loosing colors,. Drying the oceans.. All there is, is a gray dark cloud,. Rising a shield facing my sun.. But I won't take cover,. I look over my shoulder,. Miles from you."

Are you in compliance with the feet that brought you here?. I choose to live on the edge. Choose to fly. over walk. Head to open field. Cause in our bare hands we believe. We believe. We believe
