Transforming us into muted dreams. Dreaming of the day that. We attack. Attack, attack your fetal servitude. We attack. Attack, attack, attack with pesticide. We attack. All the years of propaganda. We shall attack. Books illustrate what we already know. Candles cry towards the sky. Racing your flags along polluted coasts. Dreaming of the day that. We attack. Attack, attack your fetal servitude. We attack. Attack, attack, attack with pesticide. We attack. All the years of propaganda. We shall attack. Attack. Attack. Breathing each other's lives. Holding this in mind. That if we fall, we all fall. And we fall alone. Breathing each other's lives. Holding this in mind. That if we fall, we all fall. And we fall alone. What's the philosophy of displaced mines. The bombing of all homes and villages. Truth is the only sword bleeding minds. Bleeding till the day that. We attack. Attack, attack your fetal servitude. We attack.

sultans of swing,You get a shiver in the dark. It's raining in the park but meantime. South of the river you stop and you hold everything. A band is blowing Dixie double four time. You feel alright when you hear that music ring. You step inside but you don't see too many faces. Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down. Competition in other places. But the horns be blowing that sound. Way on downsouth way on downsouth London town. We are the System Of A Down

Killers of Kennedy's with no fright. The American way!. For freedom cried the marching man. Flags ripped out of their black hands. Beaten, slain, tortured, killed. Their only mistake was being born here. Invade countries just for oil. Send your troops all down to boil. Iraq, Grenada, 'Nam and Chile. Truman doctrine, our own way. Country without a race. Formed from people you disgrace. White right conservative might. Killers of Kennedy's with no fright. The American way!. The government here can suck my balls. Policing the world in overalls. Armed rebellion, minority. Disrespected race, colored mind. Crazed loonies all walk the streets. Missing children on milk cartons. Mother selling child for crack. Mr. President, check your back. Country without a race. Formed from people you disgrace. White right conservative might. Killers of Kennedy's with no fright. The American way!. The American way!. The American way!"
