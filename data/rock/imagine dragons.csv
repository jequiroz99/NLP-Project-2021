Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat. Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast. And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke. Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal. Naked in the North Pole. That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul. And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads. So I don't fear shit but tomorrow. And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain. You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim. Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne. I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train. Cause I'm a sucker for pain. Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it. Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it. No pain, no gain. Never stand down, made our own way. Never going slow, we pick up the pace. This is what we wanted from a young age. No emotion, that's what business is. Lord have mercy on the witnesses. I torture you. Take my hand through the flames. I torture you. I'm a slave to your games. I'm just a sucker for pain. More pain. Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging. For more pain. Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging. For more pain. Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging. For more pain. Got me begging"

Naked in the North Pole. That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul. And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads. So I don't fear shit but tomorrow. And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain. You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim. Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne. I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train. Cause I'm a sucker for pain. Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it. Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it.
