buzzards and crows,We could throw ourselves in a road. But receive no comfort from street lights. Why not come in for a jamens and escape life?. We're idle in the mean time. Aristocrats and architects with broken dreams. Well I say the dead sea is dying. You say you're going underground for a while. Well we all need to be recognised for something. Not sure if the devil's eyes are blue. Work and days of underpaid still hold the key. I see this place from my window. It goes on the corner like the rest. There are the buzzards and the crows. Making eyes of a sea. Self obesessed. Now if commandment 11 is don't get caught. Then 12 must be don't ever tell. Then ask yourself do you believe you'll go to hell?. [My mate went to the crossroads to see the devil]. He never showed and if he says that I believe. I hear the place from my window. Call me like a lighthouse to the sea. There swarm the buzzards and the crows. Swirling wide talking wise and there's me. You and I hanging around. Lads who've got childish names. Scissors we cut it out. Shining before by the waves. I need to be recognised. 'Cause we could be self-assured. We could be happy indoors. I know this place from my window. I trip out and fall to the ground down below. Hoods up for the buzzards and the crows. Who believe in the void of themselves. Still believe in the void of themselves. And all the trees and animals of mountains green

one to my left,"Did you ever have to do the thing you swore you’d never do. Something filthy and impatient. Something churlish, bold and shrewd. Sit down my boy and I’ll tell you exactly how I crawled right through. Gathering your confidence and hear the story of a man who came undone.

And finally when the time comes, think of who you really need. And close your eyes so tightly think they’ll bleed. Never drop your guard or let them know, the thoughts inside your head. Just do what you’ve always done, they’ll all wish you were dead. Or crush your heart, your spirit and your soul but keep your eyes ahead. Remember when the time comes, there’ll be nowhere you can hide. It’ll just be you, your heart and your bruised pride. . Never break the line, never click your heels in time. If your heart’s anything like mine that’s not the way. Don’t get comfortable down there. Don’t pretend that it’s always fair. And your fingers crossed. And it’s not your loss. So if you really want to you can stay. You can stay. Never drop your guard and let them, know the thoughts inside your head. Just do what you’ve always done, they’ll all wish you were dead. They’ll crush your heart, the spirit and your soul but keep your eyes ahead. Then someday when your bones break, and you don’t know gifts from theft. Drink yourself away one to my left. Never break the line, never click your heels in time. If your heart’s anything like mine that’s not the way. Don’t get comfortable down there. Don’t pretend that it’s always fair.

As the days. Like the waves. Pile up behind you. La la la la la. Keep it on. Melt my plastic heart. And help me move on. Why can't I move on?. How do you escape. The great pails of pouring rain. Go to a foreign land or a house in Spain oh. La la la la la la oh. Oh how I'd kill to go. Erect the gutters and rib us in. Life or buildings and medicines. We all make the same mistakes. Our pitfalls pull us together. Are you listening. Are you listening. As the days. Like the waves. Pile up behind you. La la la la la. Keep it on. Melt my plastic heart. And help me move on. Kick this round our bedroom floor. Hate the daylight hours which you wont ignore. But the tide, the tide has drifted away. Are you listening. Are you listening. As the days like the waves decisively pull us under. La la la la la. You keep it all. Melt my plastic heart. And help me move on. And on and on on. And on and on. There's friends for life and accquaintances,. There's romance from great distances,. There's been so many casualties,. But i cannot wallow over these. Oh no. by fill ;)"
puffin' on a coffin nail,"There's a heart in a girl on a ship on a sea. And I know that girl is thinking of me. There's a heart in a girl and I know that it beats like a drum. But every time that I think of the girl my heart gets heavy and I'm stuck in a whirlwind. I turn to my shadow and my heart starts to beat like a drum. Said oh you might upon a steeple set. Broken crumbling battlements. Puffin' on a coffin nail. With a wry little smile that she keeps up her shell. And she hides that forest from the house that hide from the sun. Puffin' on a coffin nail. With a friend of a friend and an arse like a whale. Well there's a girl with a friend who was stuck in a disco rut. Slut. Oh give me the strength just to give fate a try. Though my hands get sweaty and my mouth goes dry. Just to think every time that my plans go awry, you see. Just give fate a passage but she was just a bore. And the letters are crazy and a bit cocksure. And you can't find your mind and my heart on a coffin and agree. Come with outcry and panting/pounded(?) breast. And break upon the slippery wreck. Puffin' on a coffin nail. With a friend of a friend with an arse like a whale. But this girl is a friend of a friend you see. Stuck in a disco rut. Puffin' on a coffin nail. Yes she gives you a chance and you give me the mail. And she works for the mail but she's out on bail. Well you scream. So I'm sad to say that my heart shattered this way. I knew she'd be no better. Yes I knew if I'd have met her. That I'd soon enough forget her. Now face your heros just pretend. And I've had a word with him. (But we don't really have to talk about that). Puffin' on a coffin nail. Yes she's talking like Elvis cos she's just done a rail. But her lover's on bail with a dealer like a snail on speed. Puffin' on a coffin nail. Yes I gave her a something just to tell me a tale. And she told me a tale but she told me a tale. About you. So this is the end of the road. And this is the path that you chose. Well it’s no skin off my nose. A lover with a brick has had the rose. End of the road"
the enemy,So far dishonest as the day is long. Im sorry so I’ll go now. But I love you so it wont be long. And the spectres in the masonry remind us of the things that might have been. Isn’t it time you washed your face. It looks like a burnt out fireplace. And I am awash with memories. And worrying complexities. But in time (in time). You’ll find it very scary. It’s hard to live respectfully. The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head. The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head. Everyones still all over the place. And not to humble to embrace. And oh my gosh the memories. But your arrogance perplexes me. Now this time (this time). I shouldn’t be so lary. Just try to live respectfully. The enemy as I know it is right inside my head. The enemy as I know it is right inside my head. So are you giving it a shot now. And it all came back and you did a little turn now. Well they didn’t like that. Are you going to give it up for?. (And the spectres in the masonary remind us of the things that might have been). All you need’s a gentle heart. To see you through endless dark. All you needs a gentle heart. To see you through endless dark. . The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head. The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head. The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head. The Enemy as I know it is right inside my head
the north,"Four more rotations and no one will hurt. These are the things I dream of. I've been thinking through the drinking. Though my confidence is shrinking. That I might be fine. The North would be so proud of you. What would you do. When the stars fall from the sky. And you're only two seconds from crying?. Parafin, Anadin, sick as disguise. So we take our snappy patterns. And use them as knives. Now there's nothing left for me to try. My own medicine and humble pie. But I'll be alright. The North would be so proud of you. So I'll see you tomorrow. Shall we call it one?. Trying to get sparks to light. Seeing as they've gone. You don't know how to value that. But I know how to value that. I think we'll be fine. The North would be so proud of you. What would you do. When stars fall from the sky. And you're only two seconds from crying?"
tired of england,"How can they be tired of England?. They'll never know the England that we know. Never know where the ones with the dreams go, no. Never notice the skies with their eyes down low. We'll never be tired of England. United in rain in the cities. To channel the pain and the pity's woe. To carry them back to the place below. With the blues, the greys, the green, the brown,. To lonely nights uptown. Don't let them bring you down. Lonely nights uptown. Don't let them bring us down, no. How can they be tired of London?. The sense in the air on a warm day. Generation of hope that sees better days. But moving along in the same old ways. We'll never be tired of London. From Clerkenwell into the city. The state of the roofs is a pity though. Generations all cramped with their kids in tow. With the blues, the greys, the green, the brown,. To lonely nights uptown. Don't let them bring you down. Lonely nights uptown. Don't let them bring us down, no. While the Queen of England sits on her throne. Off bingo cards and chicken bones. Don't drink yourself to a lonely death. In casinos on crystal meth. Don't drink yourself to a lonely death. In casinos on crystal meth. So sing your song of Banbury Cross. Don't breathe a word about your loss. Don't trust Old Nick to fall on dawn. Half sized cars and top shelf porn. How can they be tired of England?. How can they be tired of England?. How can they be tired of England?. How can they be tired of England?"
truth begins,This is where the truth begins. Where teardrops glance the sallow skin. You lose your will. And I can lend you mine. The westway wall’s. So tall and bleak. Reflect the words we dare not speak. By the bottle’s end. We may have done our time. What you want is to stay away from People like me. Who twist most everything they see. And leave the grey old world behind you. So sow it up kid have some clout. We’ll do some wine and fall about. The sun will shine again tomorrow. Look beyond the parapet. We are just bums lest you forget. We can beg steal and borrow. Well you said the pills would sort me out. Embolden me against the. Manifestations of fear and doubt. I just forgot who I used to be. So now I’m strung somewhere between a dream. And humdrum day to day routine. A laurel wreath from the door to my heart. What you wants to wash your face and try to breathe. Forget your mind and shut your eyes so that you can see. And leave the gray old world behind you. So sow it up kid have no doubt. We’ll go to mine and have it out. The sun will shine again tomorrow. For all the friends you've ever met. Some you’ll love and some forget. Just hold on for tomorrow. So here’s to now. And all of us of course. The hearts we tried. Make a brand new start. Let the fabric never tear us apart. And some day when. We're in the cold. Here's a semblance. We can hope so. The proposal. And put it on your heart. For me. So now I move. And if you’re in. It wouldn’t hurt just to give it a try and win. Don’t forget who you're meant to be. What you wants to get a bike and do wheelies. I bet you can’t do em half as good as me. Throw it out. When it's over it's over. So sow it up kid have some clout. We’ll have some wine and sulk about. How the sun will shine tomorrow. For all the friends you’ve not yet met. Some would die for you I’ll bet. So hold on for tomorrow. So sow it up kid have some clout. We'll go to mine and fuck about. The sun will shine again. For all friends you've not yet met. Some would die for you you I bet. So hold on for tomorrow. This is where the truth begins. For more than seven deadly sins. You lose your will. I may have hurt you're mind
wondering,"We were so pretty now is this it. You and I are too young for this. No blood no lust or spit. But still there is something there to play upon. A flash of instant thereabouts youll miss it and its gone. But still its good to be in love with someone. When you’ve always had to be with no one.. She said everyones a story of their own. But if we don’t leave now well find ourselves with no way home. And so we strolled on all bangered and confused. At first it wasn’t pretty but we soon undid that rouse so. Now we got something in many other ways. All the boys together and a knees up on the way. Still its good to be in love with someone. When you’ve always had to be with no one.. She said everyone’s a story of their own. But if we dont leave now well find ourselves with no way home. Find ourselves with no way home. And it occurred to me, I think on Lambeth Road. There’s no more need to question life. Or cry for what I’m owed. And now its over so now its done. The English sun is setting and the rude boys on the run oh. Still its good to be in love with someone. When you’ve always had to be with no one.. Still I need you to remind me every day. The lives and loves weve lost and broken on the way. Heres to tomorrow and the lonely streets well roam. But if we don’t leave now well find ourselves with no way home. Just to think were almost home"
you fucking love it,"She could never ever ever ever ever ever ever get it into her thick head. So when pretending ends shell have scattered her friends. And she’ll find she’ll wake up dead. There’s no card above receivers. Still its all so remote. Behind the bench at the rec. Where she lost fifty notes. (she says) “I used to have a future. But now I don’t know. Just dependence and repentance and a ready-brek glow”. . Just put your money in. Bruised and battered shins. You fucking love it. You fucking love it. Back on your feet again. Out on the beat again,. You fucking love it. Yeah yeah yeah. Drunk as a skunk. Lean as a dean. Always the same. Since she was thirteen. You want it. You lame duck. You want it. Youre out of luck. You’ve always been a seedy fuck. So whats it gonna be?. Just put your money in. Bruised and battered shins. You fucking love it. You fucking love it. Back on your feet again. Out on the beat again,. You fucking love it. Yeah yeah yeah. . When you boil it down. We descend from clowns to dogs. Just put your money in. Bruised and battered shins. You fucking love it. You fucking love it. Back on your feet again. Out on the beat again,. You fucking love it. Yeah yeah yeah. . When you boil it down. We descend from clowns to dogs"
