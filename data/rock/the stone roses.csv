she bangs the drums,I can feel the earth begin to move. I hear my needle hit the groove. And spiral through another day. I hear my song begin to say. Kiss me where the sun don’t shine. The past was yours. But the future’s mine. You’re all out of time. I don’t feel too steady on my feet. I feel hollow I feel weak. Passion fruit and holy bread. Fill my guts and ease my head. Through the early morning sun. I can see her here she comes. She bangs the drums. Have you seen her have you heard. The way she plays there are no words. To describe the way I feel. How could it ever come to pass. She’ll be the first she’ll be the last. To describe the way I feel. The way I feel. Have you seen her have you heard. The way she plays there are no words.

made of stone,Your knuckles whiten on the wheel. The last thing that your hands will feel. your final flight can't be delayed. No earth just sky it's so serene. Your pink fat lips let go a scream. You fry and melt I love the scene. Sometimes I fantasize. When the streets are cold and lonely. And the cars they burn below me. Don't these times fill your eyes. When the streets are cold and lonely. And the cars they burn below me. Are you all alone ?. Is anybody home ?. I'm standing warm against the cold. Now that the flames have taken hold. At least you left your life in style. And for as far as I can see. Tin twisted grills grin back at me. Bad money dies I love the scene. Sometimes I fantasize. When the streets are cold and lonely. And the cars they burn below me. Don't these times. Fill your eyes. When the streets are cold and lonely. And the cars they burn below me. Are you all alone ?. Is anybody home ?. Sometimes I fantasize. When the streets are cold and lonely. And the cars they burn below me. Don't these times. Fill your eyes. When the streets are cold and lonely. And the cars they burn below me. Are you all alone ?. Are you made of stone ?
