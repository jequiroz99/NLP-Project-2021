good riddance (time of your life),Another turning point. A fork stuck in the road. Time grabs you by the wrist. Directs you where to go. So make the best of this test. And don't ask why. It's not a question. But a lesson learned in time. It's something unpredictable. But in the end is right. I hope you had the time of your life. So take the photographs. And still frames in your mind. Hang it on a shelf. Of good health and good time. Tattoos of memories. And dead skin on trial. For what it's worth. It was worth all the while. It's something unpredictable. But in the end is right. I hope you had the time of your life. It's something unpredictable. But in the end is right. I hope you had the time of your life. It's something unpredictable. But in the end is right. I hope you had the time of your life
boulevard of broken dreams,"I walk a lonely road. The only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes. But it's home to me and I walk alone. I walk this empty street. On the boulevard of broken dreams. Where the city sleeps. And I'm the only one and I walk alone. I walk alone I walk alone. I walk alone I walk a..... {Chorus}. My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart is the only thing that's beating. Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me. Till then I walk alone. ah - ah - ah - ah - ah - ah -aaah - ah - ah -ah -ah. . I'm walking down the line. That divides me somewhere in my mind. On the border line of the edge. And where I walk alone. Read between the lines. What's fucked up and everything's alright. Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive. And I walk alone. I walk alone I walk alone. I walk alone I walk a.... {Chorus}. My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart is the only thing that's beating. Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me. Till then I walk alone. ah - ah - ah - ah - ah - ah -aaah - ah - ah -ah -ah. I walk alone, I walk a.... I walk this empty street. On the Boulevard of broken dreams. When the city sleeps. And I'm the only one and I walk a.... {Chorus}. My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart is the only thing that's beating. Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me. Till then I walk alone"
wake me up when september ends,Summer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Like my father's come to pass. Seven years has gone so fast. Wake me up when September ends. Here comes the rain again. Falling from the stars. Drenched in my pain again. Becoming who we are. As my memory rests. But never forgets what I lost. Wake me up when September ends. Summer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Ring out the bells again. Like we did when spring began. Wake me up when september ends. Here comes the rain again. Falling from the stars. Drenched in my pain again. Becoming who we are. As my memory rests. But never forgets what I lost. Wake me up when september ends. Summer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Like my father's come to pass. Twenty years has gone so fast. Wake me up when September ends. Wake me up when September ends. Wake me up when September ends
21 guns,"Do you know What's worth fighting for,. When It's not worth dying for?. Does it take your breath away. And you feel yourself suffocating?. Does the pain weight out the pride?. And you look for a place to hide?. Did someone break your heart inside?. You're in ruins. One, 21 guns. Lay down your arms. Give up the fight. One, 21 guns. Throw up your arms. Into the sky. You and I. When you're at the end of the road. And you lost all sense of control. And your thoughts have taken their toll. When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul. Your faith walks on broken glass. And the hangover doesn't pass. Nothing's ever built to last. You're in ruins. One, 21 guns. Lay down your arms. Give up the fight. One, 21 guns. Throw up your arms. Into the sky. You and I. Did you try to live on your own?. When you burned down the house and home?. Did you stand too close to the fire?. Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone. When it's time to live and let die. And you can't get another try. Something inside this heart has died. You're in ruins. One, 21 guns. Lay down your arms. Give up the fight. One, 21 guns. Throw up your arms. Into the sky. One, 21 guns. Lay down your arms. Give up the fight. One, 21 guns. Throw up your arms. Into the sky. You and I"
holiday,"Hear the sound of the falling rain. Coming down like an Armageddon flame (HEY!). The shame, the ones who died without a name. Hear the dogs howling out of key. To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!). And bleed, the company lost the war today. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. On holiday. Hear the drum pounding out of time. Another protestor has crossed the line (HEY!). To find, the money's on the other side. Can I get another Amen (AMEN!). There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (HEY!). A gag, A plastic bag on a monument. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. On holiday. The representative from California has the floor. Zieg Heil to the president gasman. Bombs away is your punishment. Pulverize the Eiffel towers. Who criticize your government. Bang bang goes the broken glass. Kill all the fags that don't agree. Trials by fire, setting fire. Is not a way that's meant for me. Just cause...(hey, hey). Just cause, because we're outlaws YEAH!. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. This is our lives on holiday"
basket case,Do you have the time. To listen to me whine. About nothing and everything all at once. I am one of those. Melodramatic fools. Neurotic to the bone. No doubt about it. Sometimes I give myself the creeps. Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. It all keeps adding up. I think I'm cracking up. Am I just paranoid?. Am I just stoned?. I went to a shrink. To analyze my dreams. She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down. I went to a whore. She said my life's a bore. Just quit my whining cause it's bringing her down. Sometimes I give myself the creeps. Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. It all keeps adding up. I think I'm cracking up. Am I just paranoid?. Am I just stoned?. Grasping to control. So I better hold on. Sometimes I give myself the creeps. Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. It all keeps adding up. I think I'm cracking up. Am I just paranoid?. Am I just stoned?
american idiot,Don't wanna be an American Idiot. Don't want a nation under the new media. Can you hear the sound of hysteria?. The subliminal mind Fuck America. Welcome to a new kind of tension. All across the alienation. Where everything isn't meant to be ok. Television dreams of tomorrow. We're not the ones meant to follow. For that's enough to argue. Maybe I am the faggot America.

green day,"A small cloud has fallen the white mist hits the ground. My lungs comfort me with joy. Vegging on one detail the rest just crowds around. My eyes itch of burning red. Picture sounds. Of moving insects so surreal. Lay around. Looks like I found something new. Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field. I picture someone, I think it's you. You're standing so damn close my body begins to swell. Why does 1 and 1 make 2?. Picture sounds. Of moving insects so surreal. Lay around. Looks like I found something new. Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field. I picture someone, I think it's you. You're standing so damn close my body begins to swell. Why does 1 and 1 make 2?. Picture sounds.

jesus of suburbia,"[Part I]. I'm the son of rage and love. The Jesus of suburbia. From the bible of none of the above. On a steady diet of. Soda pop and Ritalin. No one ever died for my sins in hell. As far as I can tell. At least the ones I got away with. And there's nothing wrong with me. This is how I'm supposed to be. In the land of make believe. That don't believe in me. Get my television fix. sitting on my crucifix. A living room on my private womb. While the moms and brads are away. To fall in love and fall in debt. To alcohol and cigarettes. And mary jane. To keep me insane. Doing someone else's cocaine. And there's nothing wrong with me. This is how I'm supposed to be. In the land of make believe. That don't believe in me. . [Part Ii: City Of The Damned]. At the center of the Earth. In the parking lot. Of the 7-11 where I was taught. The motto was just a lie. It says home is where your heart is. But what a shame. Cause everyone's heart. Doesn't beat the same. It's beating out of time. City of the dead. At the end of another lost highway. Signs misleading to nowhere. city of the damned. Lost children with dirty faces today. No one really seems to care. I read the graffiti. In the bathroom stall. Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall. And so it seemed to confess. It didn't say much. But it only confirmed that. The center of the earth. Is the end of the world. And I could really care less. City of the dead. At the end of another lost highway. Signs misleading to nowhere. city of the damned. Lost children with dirty faces today. Noone really seems to care. Hey!. . [Part Iii: I Don't Care]. I don't care if you don't. I don't care if you don't. I don't care if you don't care X5. I don't care. Everyone's so full of shit. Born and raised by hypocrits. Hearts recycled but never saved. From the cradle to the grave. We are the kids of war and peace. From Anaheim to the Middle East. We are the stories and disciples of. The Jesus of suburbia. Land of make believe. And it don't believe in me. Land of make believe. And I don't believe. And I don't care!. I don't care!. . [Part Iv: Dearly Beloved]. Dearly beloved are you listening?. I can't remember a word. that you were saying. Are we demented or am I disturbed?. The space that's in between insane and insecure.. Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?. Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?. Nobody's perfect and I stand accused. For lack of a better word,. and that's my best excuse.. . [Part V: Tales Of Another Broken Home]. To live and not to breathe. Is to die in tragedy. To run, to run away. To find what you believe. And I leave behind. This hurricane of fucking lies. I lost my faith to this. This town that don't exist. So I run. I run away. The light of masochist. And I leave behind. This hurricane of fucking lies. And I walked this line. A million and one fucking times. But not this time. I don't feel any shame. I won't apologize. When there ain't nowhere you can go. Running away from pain. When you've been victimized. Tales from another broken home. You're leaving.... You're leaving.... You're leaving.... Ah! You're leaving home..."
she,She. She screams in silence. A sullen riot penetrating through her mind. Waiting for a sign. To smash the silence with the brick of self-control. Are you locked up in a world. That's been planned out for you. Are you feeling like a social tool without a use. Scream at me until my ears bleed. I'm taking heed just for you. She. She's figured out. All her doubts were someone else's point of view. Waking up this time. To smash the silence with the brick of self-control. Are you locked up in a world. That's been planned out for you. Are you feeling like a social tool without a use. Scream at me until my ears bleed. I'm taking heed just for you. Are you locked up in a world. That's been planned out for you. Are you feeling like a social tool without a use. Scream at me until my ears bleed. I'm taking heed just for you
when i come around,"I heard you crying loud,. all the way across town. You've been searching for that someone,. and it's me out on the prowl. As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself. Well don't get lonely now. And dry your whining eyes. I'm just roaming for the moment. Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight. you been thinking about ditching me. No time to search the world around. Cause you know where I'll be found. When I come around. I heard it all before. So don't knock down my door. I'm a loser and a user. so I don't need no accuser. to try and slag me down. because I know you're right. So go do what you like. Make sure you do it wise. You may find out. that your selfdoubt means nothing was ever there. You can't go forcing something if it's just not right. No time to search the world around. Cause you know where I'll be found. When I come around. When I come around. When I come around. When I come around. When I come around"
last night on earth,"I text a postcard, sent to you. Did it go through?. Sending all my love to you. You're the moonlight of my life everynight. Giving all my love to you. My beating heart belongs to you. I walked for miles till I found you. I'm here to honour you. If I lose everything in the fire. I'm sending all my love to you. With every breath that I am worth. Here on earth. I'm sending all my love to you. So if you dare to second guess. You can rest. Assured all my love's for you. My beating heart belongs to you. I walked for miles till I found you. I'm here to honor you. If I lose everything in the fire. I'm sending all my love to you. My beating heart belongs to you. I walked for miles till I found you. I'm here to honour you. If I lose everything in the fire. Did I ever make it through?"
welcome to paradise,"Dear mother, can you hear me whining?. It's been three whole weeks since that. I have left your home. This sudden fear has left me trembling. Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own. And I'm feeling so alone. Pay attention to the cracked streets. And the broken homes. Some call it slums. Some call it nice. I want to take you through a wasteland. I like to call my home. Welcome to paradise. A gunshot rings out at the station. Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own. It makes me wonder why I'm still here. For some strange reason it's now. Feeling like my home. And I'm never gonna go. Pay attention to the cracked streets. And the broken homes. Some call it slums. Some call it nice. I want to take you through a wasteland. I like to call my home. Welcome to paradise. Dear mother, can you hear me laughing. It's been six whole months since that. I have left your home. It makes me wonder why I'm still here. For some strange reason it's now. Feeling like my home. And I'm never gonna go. Pay attention to the cracked streets. And the broken homes. Some call it slums. Some call it nice. I want to take you through a wasteland. I like to call my home. Welcome to paradise"
minority,"I wanna be the minority. I don't need your authority. Down with the moral majority. 'Cause I wanna be the minority. I pledge allegiance to the underworld. One nation under dog. There of which I stand alone. A face in the crowd. Unsung, against the mold. Without a doubt. Singled out. The only way I know. I wanna be the minority. I don't need your authority. Down with the moral majority. 'Cause I wanna be the minority. Stepped out of the line. Like a sheep run from the heard. Marching out of time. To my own beat now. The only way I know. One light, one mind. Flashing in the dark. Blinded by a silence of a thousand broken hearts. ""For crying out loud"" she screamed into me. A free for all. fuck 'em all. ""You are your own sight"". I wanna be the minority. I don't need your authority. Down with the moral majority. 'Cause I wanna be the minority. One light, one mind. Flashing in the dark. Blinded by a silence of a thousand broken hearts. ""For crying out loud"" she screamed into me. A free for all. fuck 'em all. ""you are your own sight"". 'Cause I wanna be the minority. I don't need your authority. Down with the moral majority. 'Cause I wanna be the minority. (I wanna be the minority.) x3"

oh love,"Oh love, oh love. Won't you rain on me tonight?. Oh life, oh life. Please don't pass me by. Don't stop, don't stop. Don't stop when the red lights flash. Oh ride, free ride. Won't you take me close to you?. Far away, far away. Waste away tonight. I'm wearing my heart on a noose. Far away, far away. Waste away tonight. Tonight my heart's on the loose. Oh lights and action. I just can't be satisfied. Oh losers and choosers. Won't you please hold on my life. Oh hours and hours. Like the dog years of the day. Old story, same old story. Won't you see the light of day. Far away, far away. Waste away tonight. I'm wearing my heart on a noose. Far away, far away. Waste away tonight. Tonight my heart's on the loose. Talk myself out of feeling. Talk my way out of control. Talk myself out of falling in love. Falling in love with you. Oh love, oh love. Won't you rain on me tonight?. Oh ride, free ride. Won't you take me close to you?. Far away, far away. Waste away tonight. I'm wearing my heart on a noose. Far away, far away. Waste away tonight. Tonight my heart's on the loose. Far away, far away. Waste away tonight. I'm wearing my heart on a noose. Far away, far away. Waste away tonight. Tonight my heart's on the loose. Tonight my heart's on the loose. Tonight my heart's on the loose"
longview,"I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on. I change the channels for an hour or two.. Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit. I'm sick of all the same old shit.. In a house with unlocked doors. and I'm fuckin' lazy.. Bite my lip and close my eyes. Take me away to paradise.. I'm so damn bored I'm going blind!!!. And I smell like shit.. Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving. I'm sure as hell can't do it by myself.. I'm feeling like a dog in heat. Barred indoors from the summer street.. I locked the door to my own cell. And I lost the key. Bite my lip and close my eyes. Take me away to paradise.. I'm so damn bored I'm going blind!!!. And I smell like shit.. I got no motivation. Where is my motivation?. No time for the motivation. Smoking my inspiration.. I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling.. Call me pathetic. Call me what you will.. My mother says to get a job. But she doesn't like the one she's got.. When masturbation's lost its fun. You're fucking lonely!. Bite my lip and close my eyes. Take me away to paradise.. I'm so damn bored I'm going blind. And loneliness has to suffice.. Bite my lip and close my eyes. slipping away to paradise.. Some say 'Quit or I'll go blind.'. But it's just a myth"

somewhere now,"I'm running late to somewhere now. I don't want to be. Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be. I never wanted to compromise and bargain with my soul.

ashley,Ashley!. Are you running around?. Now you're crying at a bloody murder. Ashley!. Are you bumming around?. You are crying on my cold shoulder. Used a tangled mind with your puppet strings. You dangled your desires right in front of my face. You let me into the world but wouldn't let me drink. Swallowing my pride and I never even got the taste. But time comes around and I'm not so naive. I've finally lost touch cause you're so out of reach. You say that you're fine but I know that you ain't.

My chance is looking a bit grey. Starting across the room. Are you leaving soon?. I just need a little time. What is it that drives me mad. Girls like you that I never had. What is it about you that I adore?. What makes me feel so much pain. That makes me go so insane. What is it about you that I adore?. Starting across the room. Are you leaving soon?. I just need a little time. What time? wooow!. Why did you have to leave so soon?. Why did you have to walk away?. Oh well it happened again. She walked away with her boyfriend. Maybe we'll meet again someday.. Maybe we'll meet again someday.. Maybe we'll meet again someday.. Someday!

basket case,Do you have the time. To listen to me whine. About nothing and everything all at once. I am one of those. Melodramatic fools. Neurotic to the bone. No doubt about it.

To analyze my dreams. She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down. I went to a whore. She said my life's a bore. Just quit my whining cause it's bringing her down. Sometimes I give myself the creeps. Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. It all keeps adding up. I think I'm cracking up. Am I just paranoid?. Am I just stoned?. Grasping to control.

before the lobotomy,"Dreaming. I was only dreaming. of another place and time. Where my family's from. Singing. I can hear them singing. When the rain had washed away. All these scattered dreams.

Christian sang the eulogy. Sign my love a lost memory. From the end of the century. Well, it's enough to make you sick. To cast a stone and throw a brick. When the sky is falling down. It burned your dreams into the ground. Christian's lesson is what he's been sold. We are normal and selfcontrolled. Remember to learn to forget. Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes. Well I'm not stoned. I'm just fucked up. I got so high I can't stand up. I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessed. I'm not in love 'cause I'm a mess. Like refugees. We're lost like refugees. Like refugees. We're lost like refugees. The brutality of reality. Is the freedom that keeps me from. Dreaming. I was only dreaming. of another place and time. Where my familys from. Singing.

coming clean,Seventeen and strung out on confusion. Trapped inside a roll of disillusion. I found out what it takes to be a man. Mom and dad will never understand. Secrets collecting dust but never forget. Skeletons come to life in my closet. I found out what it takes to be a man. Mom and dad will never understand. What’s happening to me. Seventeen and coming clean for the first time. I finally figured out myself for the first time. I found out what it takes to be a man. Mom and dad will never understand. What’s happened to me
deadbeat holiday,"Wake up, The house is on fire. And the cat's caught in the dryer. Philosophy's a liar when. Your home is your headstone. ""Icon"" is the last chance for hope.

Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay. There's a vacant sign that's hanging high. On a noose over your home. Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray. There's a vacant sign that's hanging high. But at least you're not alone. Christmas lights in the middle of August. Grudges come back to haunt us. Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies. Grounded in a duplex to find that. You're living on a landmine. Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive. Last chance to piss it all away. Nothing but hell to pay. When the lights are going down. Deadbeat Holiday - celebrate your own decay. There's a vacant sign that's hanging high. On a noose over your home. Deadbeat Holiday - get on your knees and pray.

Left on my face I've cried. Oh I love her. Keep dreaming of her. Will I understand. If she wants to be my friend. I'll send a letter to that girl. Asking her to by my own. But my pen is writing wrong. So I'll say it in a song. Oh I love you more right now. More than I've ever loved before. Here's those words straight from these lips. I'll need you forever more.. Come ease the pain that's in my heart. Come ease the pain that's in my heart. Come ease the pain that's in my heart. Come ease the pain that's in my heart

Don't want anybody wasting beer. Pass another lime and Corona. Too drunk to use my clutch when shifting gear. Let's get drunk and go out driving. Let's do prodies in the cul de sac. Let's get drunk and go out driving. We're going and we're never coming back

having a blast,"I'm taking all you down with me. Explosive duct taped to my spine. Nothing's gonna change my mind. I won't listen to anyone's last words. There's nothing left for you to say. Soon you'll be dead anyway. Well no one here, is getting out alive. This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care. So close your eyes. And kiss yourself goodbye. And think about the times you spent. And what they've meant. To me it's nothing (several x). I'm losing all my happiness. The happiness you pinned on my. Loneliness still comforts me. My anger dwells inside of me. I'm taking it all out on you. And all the shit you put me through. So no one here, is getting out alive. This time I've lost my mind and I don't care. So close your eyes. And kiss yourself goodbye. And think about the times. You spent and what they've meant. To me it's nothing (several x). Do you ever think back to another time ?. Does it bring you so down. That you thought you lost your mind ?. Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction. And mow down any bullshit that confronts you ?. Do you ever build up all the small things in your head. To make one problem that adds up to nothing. To me it's nothing (several x)"
hearts collide,"Love conquers everytime. When two hearts come to collide. You're the card. In my valentine. And the candy hearts. In my mind. And true love is the rule. And you're nobody's fool. The ship's coming to the light. And it was love at first sight. Baby baby you're the light. And the flame burns in my minds eye. the child bleeds into bliss. And I knew it from the first kiss. Tonight hearts collide. Hearts collide, hearts collide"
hitchin' a ride,"Hey mister, where you headed?. Are you in a hurry?. I need a lift to happy hour say oh no. Do you brake for distilled spirits?. I need a break as well. The well that inebriates the guilt. 1,2,1,2,3,4. Cold turkey's getting stale. Tonight I'm eating crow. Fermented salmonella poison oak no. There's a drought at the fountain of youth. And I'm dehydrating. My tongue is swelling up. I say 1,2,1,2,3,4. Troubled times. You know I cannot lie. I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride. There's a drought at the fountain of youth. And now I'm dehydrating. My tongue is swelling up. I say. Shit!. Troubled times. You know I cannot lie. I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride. Hitchin' a ride [*8]"
hold on,As I step to the edge. On the shadow of a doubt. With my conscience beating. Like the pulse of a drum. That hammers on and on. Until I reach the break of the day. When the sun beats down. on halfway house. as my conscience beating. The sound in my ear. The will to perserve. As I reach the break of the day. When you lost all hope and excuses. And the cheapskates & losers. Nothing's left to cling onto. You got to hold on to yourself. A cry of hope. A plea for peace. And my conscience beating. It's not what I want for. It's all that I need. To reach the break of the Day. So I run to the edge. On the shadows of a doubt. With my conscience bleeding. Here lies the truth. The lost treasures of my youth. As I hold to the break of the day. When you lost all hope and excuses. And the cheapskates & losers. Nothing's left to cling onto. You got to hold on to yourself. When you lost all hope and excuses. And the cheapskates & losers. Nothing's left to cling onto. You got to hold on to yourself
holiday,"Hear the sound of the falling rain. Coming down like an Armageddon flame (HEY!). The shame, the ones who died without a name. Hear the dogs howling out of key. To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!). And bleed, the company lost the war today. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. On holiday. Hear the drum pounding out of time. Another protestor has crossed the line (HEY!). To find, the money's on the other side. Can I get another Amen (AMEN!). There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (HEY!). A gag, A plastic bag on a monument. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. On holiday. The representative from California has the floor. Zieg Heil to the president gasman. Bombs away is your punishment. Pulverize the Eiffel towers. Who criticize your government. Bang bang goes the broken glass. Kill all the fags that don't agree. Trials by fire, setting fire. Is not a way that's meant for me. Just cause...(hey, hey). Just cause, because we're outlaws YEAH!. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. This is our lives on holiday"

homecoming,"[Part I: The Death Of St. Jimmy]. My heart is beating from me. I'm standing all alone. Please call me only if you are coming home. Waste another year flies by. Waste a night or two. You taught me how to live. In the streets of shame. Where you've lost your dreams in the rain. There's no sign of hope. The stems and seeds of the last of the dope. There's a glow of light. The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night. Bearing gifts and trust. A fixture in the city of lust. What the hell's your name?. What's your pleasure what is your pain?. Do you dream to much?. Do you think what you need is a crutch?. In the crowd of pain.. St. Jimmy comes without any shame. He says ""we're fucked up"". But we're not the same. And mom and dad are the ones you can blame. Jimmy died today. He blew his brains out into the bay. In the state of mind. Is my own private suicide. [Part II: East 12th St.]. Well nobody cares. Well nobody cares. Does anyone care if nobody cares?. Well nobody cares. Well nobody cares. Does anyone care if nobody cares?. Jesus filling out paperwork now. At the facility on East 12th st.. He's not listening to a word now. He's in his own world. And he's daydreaming. He'd rather be doing something else now. Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly. His life's on the line with anxiety now. And she had enough. And he had plenty. Somebody get me out of here. Anybody get me out of here. Somebody get me out of here. Get me the fuck right out of here. So far away. I don't want to stay. Get me out of here right now. Just wanna be free. Is there a possibility. Get me out of here right now, right. This life like dream ain't for me. [Part III: Nobody likes you!]. I fell asleep while watching Spike TV. After 10 cups of coffee. And you're still not here. Dreaming of a song. But something went wrong. And you can't tell anyone. 'Cause noone's here. Left me here alone. And I should've stayed home. After 10 cups of coffee. I'm thinking (where'd you go?). Nobody likes you. Everyone left you. (Where'd you go?). They're all out without you. Havin' fun. (Where'd you go?). Everyone left you. Nobody likes you. (Where'd you go?). They're all out without you. Havin' fun. (Where'd you go?). [Part IV Rock And Roll Girlfriend]. Jeez...ha.... I got a rock and roll band. I got a rock and roll life. I got a rock and roll girlfriend. And another ex-wife. I got a rock and roll house. I got a rock and roll car. I play the shit out the drums. And I can play the guitar. I got a kid in New York. I got a kid in the bay. I haven't drank or smoked nothin'. In over 22 days. So get off my case. Off of my case. Off of my case. . [Part V: We're Coming Home Again]. HEY!. Here they come marching down the street. Like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat. Coming back from the edge of town. Underneath their feet. The time has come and it's going nowhere. Nobody ever said that life was fair now. Go-carts and guns. are treasures they will bear. In the summer heat. The world is spinning. Round and round. Out of control again. From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down. So send my love a letterbomb. And visit me in hell. We're the ones going. Home. We're coming home again. Home. We're coming home again. I started fuckin' running. As soon as my feet touched ground. We're back in barrio. And to you and me, that's jingle town. That's home. We're coming home again. Home. We're coming home again. Home. We're coming home again. Home. We're coming home again. Home. We're coming home again. Home. We're coming home again. Home. We're coming home again. (NO FUCKING CONTROL I NEED IT I KNOW...). Home. We're coming home again. Nobody likes you. Everyone left you. They're all out without you. Havin' fun..."

The time has come and it going nowhere. Nobody ever said that life was fair now (Verse 2). Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear. In the summer heat. The world is spinning. Around and around (Pre-Chorus). Out of control again. From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down. So send my love a letterbomb. And visit me in hell (Chorus).

horseshoes and handgrenades,"I'm not fucking around. I think I'm coming out. All the deceivers and cheaters. I think we've got a bleeder right now. Want you to slap me around. Want you to knock me out. Well, you missed me kissed me. Now you better kick me down. Maybe you're the runner up. But the first one to lose the race. Almost only really counts in. Horseshoes and hand grenades. I'm gonna burn it all down. I'm gonna rip it out. Well, everything that you employ. Was meant for me to destroy. To the ground now. So don't you fuck me around. Because I'll shoot you down. I'm gonna drink, fight and fuck. And pushing my luck. All the time now. Maybe you're the runner up. But the first one to lose the race. Almost only really counts in. Horseshoes and hand grenades. Demolition, self-destruction. What to annihilate. The age-old contradiction. Demolition, self-destruction. What to annihilate. The age-old contradiction. Demolition, self-destruction. What to annihilate. The old age. I'm not fucking around. I think I'm coming out. All the deceivers and cheaters. I've think we've got a bleeder right now. I'm not fucking around"

i don't want to know if you're lonely,"I'm curious to know exactly how you are. I keep my distance but that distance is too far. It reassures me just to know that you're okay. But i don't want you to go on needing me this way. Don't wanna know if you are lonely. Don't wanna know if you are less than lonely. Don't wanna know if you are lonely. Don't wanna know, don't want to know. The day you left me left me feeling oh so bad. Still i'm not sure about all the doubts we had. From the beginning we both knew it wouldn't last. Decisions have been made, the die has been cast. The phone is ringing and the clock says 4 am. If it's your friends, well i don't wanna hear from them. So leave your number and a message at the tone. Or you can just go on and leave me here alone"
i want to be alone,"I lock myself inside my room. I want to be alone. With you around, you'll only add on. I want to be alone. It's been disturbed by my thoughts. I want to be alone. With you around, you'll only add on. I want to be alone. Please don't think I'm crazy. I don't want you to understand. My mind is growing hazy. To hell with your helping hand. Why don't you just leave me alone. This conflict is my own. Keep your sources away from me. That's all"

i was there,"Looking back upon my life. And the places that I´ve been. Pictures, faces, girls I´ve loved. I try to remember when. Faded memories on the wall. Some names I have forgotten. But each one is a memory I. Look back on so often. I look into the past. I want to make it last. I was there. Looking back what I have done. There´s lots more life to live. At times I feel overwhelmed. I question what I can´t give. But I don´t let it get me down. Or cause me too much sorrow. There´s no doubt about who I am. I always have tomorrow. I look into the past. I want to make it last. I was there. Looking back upon my life (all my life). Faded memories on the wall (on the wall). Looking now at who I am ( who am I? ). I don´t let it get me down ( I don´t let it get me down)"
in the end,"All brawn and no brains. And all those nice things. You FINALLY got what you want. Someone to look good with. AND light your cigarette. Is this what you really want ?. I figured out what you're all about. And I don't think I like what I see. SOOOOO .... I HOPE I won't be there in the end. If you come around.. How long will he last. Before he's a CREEP in the past. And you're alone once again ?. Will you pop up AGAIN and be my. ""SPECIAL FRIEND"" 'till the end ?. And when will that be ?. I figured out what you're all about. And I don't think I like what I see. SOOOOO .... I HOPE I won't be there in the end. If you come around.. I figured out what you're all about. And I don't think I like what I see. SOOOOO .... I HOPE I won't be there in the end. If you come around."

j.a.r.,"My friend drove off the other day,. And now he's gone and all they say,. Is you gotta live cuz life goes on.... But now I see I'm mortal, too,. I can't live my life like you,. Gotta live it up, while life goes on.. And I think that it's all right,. That I do what I like,. Cuz that's the way I wanna live.. And so I give, and I'm still givin'.... And now I wonder 'bout my friend,. If he gave all he could give,. Cuz he lived his life like I live mine.. If you could see inside my head,. Then you'd start to understand,. The things I value in my heart.. And I think that it's all right,. That I do what I like,. Cuz that's the way I wanna live.. And so I give, and I'm still givin'.... You know that.... I know that.... You're watchin' me!. And I think that it's all right,. That I do what I like,. Cuz that's the way I wanna live.. And so I give, and I'm still givin'.... Gotta make a plan,. Gotta do what's right,. Can't run around in circles,. If you wanna build a life,. But I don't wanna make a plan,. For a day far away,. While I'm young and while I'm able,. All I wanna do is...."
jackass,To know you is to hate you. So loving you must be like suicide. I don't mind if you don't mind. I'm not the one that's going to die. I guess I just can't listen. To this one sided conversation again. 'cause I don't care if I don't care. No one ever said that life is fair. Everybody loves a joke. But no one likes a fool. And you're always cracking the same old lines again. You're well rehearsed on every verse. And that was stated clear. But no one understands your verity. The center of attention. Got an honorable mention once again. Congratulations and salutations. You're a figment of your own imagination. Everybody loves a joke. But no one likes a fool. And you're always cracking the same old lines again. You're well rehearsed on every verse. And that was stated clear. But no one understands your verity. To know you is to bait you. And you fell victim to your own denial. I don't mind if you don't mind. If you're wasting all your time
jaded,"Somebody keep my balance. I think I'm falling off. Into a state of regression. The expiration date. Rapidly coming up. It's leaving me behind to rank. Always move forward. Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere. There is no progress. Evolution killed it all. I found my place in nowhere. I'm taking one step sideways. Leading with my crutch. Got a freaked up equilibrium. Count down from 9 to 5. Hooray! We're gonna die!. Blessed into our extinction. Always move forward. Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere. There is no progress. Evolution killed it all. I found my place in nowhere. Always move forward. Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere. There is no progress. Evolution killed it all. I found my place in nowhere"
jesus of suburbia,"[Part I]. I'm the son of rage and love. The Jesus of suburbia. From the bible of none of the above. On a steady diet of. Soda pop and Ritalin. No one ever died for my sins in hell. As far as I can tell. At least the ones I got away with. And there's nothing wrong with me. This is how I'm supposed to be. In the land of make believe. That don't believe in me. Get my television fix. sitting on my crucifix. A living room on my private womb. While the moms and brads are away. To fall in love and fall in debt. To alcohol and cigarettes. And mary jane. To keep me insane. Doing someone else's cocaine. And there's nothing wrong with me. This is how I'm supposed to be. In the land of make believe. That don't believe in me. . [Part Ii: City Of The Damned]. At the center of the Earth. In the parking lot. Of the 7-11 where I was taught. The motto was just a lie. It says home is where your heart is. But what a shame. Cause everyone's heart. Doesn't beat the same. It's beating out of time. City of the dead. At the end of another lost highway. Signs misleading to nowhere. city of the damned. Lost children with dirty faces today. No one really seems to care. I read the graffiti. In the bathroom stall. Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall. And so it seemed to confess. It didn't say much. But it only confirmed that. The center of the earth. Is the end of the world. And I could really care less. City of the dead. At the end of another lost highway. Signs misleading to nowhere. city of the damned. Lost children with dirty faces today. Noone really seems to care. Hey!. . [Part Iii: I Don't Care]. I don't care if you don't. I don't care if you don't. I don't care if you don't care X5. I don't care. Everyone's so full of shit. Born and raised by hypocrits. Hearts recycled but never saved. From the cradle to the grave. We are the kids of war and peace. From Anaheim to the Middle East. We are the stories and disciples of. The Jesus of suburbia. Land of make believe. And it don't believe in me. Land of make believe. And I don't believe. And I don't care!. I don't care!. . [Part Iv: Dearly Beloved]. Dearly beloved are you listening?. I can't remember a word. that you were saying. Are we demented or am I disturbed?. The space that's in between insane and insecure.. Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?. Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?. Nobody's perfect and I stand accused. For lack of a better word,. and that's my best excuse.. . [Part V: Tales Of Another Broken Home]. To live and not to breathe. Is to die in tragedy. To run, to run away. To find what you believe. And I leave behind. This hurricane of fucking lies. I lost my faith to this. This town that don't exist. So I run. I run away. The light of masochist. And I leave behind. This hurricane of fucking lies. And I walked this line. A million and one fucking times. But not this time. I don't feel any shame. I won't apologize. When there ain't nowhere you can go. Running away from pain. When you've been victimized. Tales from another broken home. You're leaving.... You're leaving.... You're leaving.... Ah! You're leaving home..."

jinx,"I fucked up again it's all my fault. So turn me around and face the wall. Read me my rights and tell me I'm wrong. Until it gets into my thick skull. A slap on the wrist. A stab in the back. Torture me, I've been a bad boy. Nail me to the cross until you have won. I lost before I did any wrong. I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck. Keep you distance 'cause it's rubbing off. Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell. Or earth with me tangled at your feet. You finally met you nemesis disguised as your fatal long lost love. So kiss it good bye. Until death do we part. You fell for a jinx for crying out loud."
kill the dj,"Walking after dark. In the New York City park. Your thoughts are so unholy. In the holiness of old. On with Christian soldiers. Filled with jivin' mind control.

Someone shoot the DJ. Someone kill the DJ. Someone shoot the DJ. Voices in my head are saying. Shoot the DJ down. We are the vultures the dirtiest kind. We'll cut you once in your heart and your mind. OOh. Walking after dark. In the New York City park. I'll pick up what's left in the club. A pocket full of pills. Sodom and Gommorah, in the century of thrills. The blood left on the dancefloor. Running, running red. The bullet that you asked for. Killing you to death. Unless you. Someone kill the DJ. Someone shoot the DJ. Someone kill the DJ. Someone shoot the DJ. Someone kill the DJ. Someone shoot the DJ. Hold him under water until he suffocates and drowns. We are the vultures the dirtiest kind.

kill the dj (explicit),"Walking after dark. In the New York City park. Your thoughts are so unholy. In the holiness of old. On with Christian soldiers. Filled with jivin' mind control.

king for a day,"Started at the age of four. My mother went to the grocery store. Went sneaking through her bedroom door. To find something in a size four. Sugar and spice and everything nice.

lady cobra,"Well, I met a girl named Lady Cobra. Her black heart beat screams sinning clover. She gives me chills and fever blisters. She's serving spells and voodoo shakes. Well, she just wants to get me high. Stick a needle in my eye. Reeks like a loss of temptation,. living on my inner demons. I don't wanna suicide,. I don't want this to end. I just wanna be your friend. Cuddle up with me real tight. Talk to me by candlelight. Do you wanna play a game of Twister. Like a dirty old man with a babysitter?. I don't wanna suicide,. I don't want this to end. I just wanna be your friend. Well, I don't want to make you cry. Cross my heart and hope to die. Drawin' blood and lonely stars. Drink and kiss for cheap guitars. I don't wanna suicide,. I don't want this to end. I just wanna to be your friend. Oh, your friend"

last of the american girls,She puts her make up on. Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland. She's got her little book of conspiracies. Right in her hand. She is paranoid like. Endangered species headed into extinction. She is one of a kind. She's the last of the american girls. She wears her overcoat. for the coming of the nuclear winter. She is riding her bike. Like a fugitive of critical mass. She's on a hunger strike. For the ones who won't make it for dinner. She makes enough to survive. For a holiday of working class. She's runaway of the establishment incorporated. She won't cooperate. She's the last of the american girls. She plays her vinyl records. Singing songs on the eve of destruction. She's a sucker for. All the criminals breaking the laws. She will come in first. For the end of western civilization. She's an endless war. She's a hero for the lost cause. Like a hurricane. In the heart of the devastation. She's a natural disaster. She's the last of the american girls. She puts her makeup on. Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland.

lazy bones,I'm too tired to be bored. I'm too bored to be tired. And the silence is so deafening. It's like picking at a sore. I'm too mental to go crazy. I'm too drunk to be pure. And my mind is playing tricks on me. And I can't sleep tonight 'cause I'm so tired. I can't take it anymore. And with all the liars. Like a prisoner of war. I don't want your sympathy. I don't want your honesty. I just want to get some peace of mind. It's only in my head. As I roll over and play dead. I don't want to hear it anymore. It's good to see you. But I really must admit. There's an odor in the air. And I think you look like shit. I can't stand from falling down. I'm too sick to throw up. Everyone keeps talking. And they can't shut the fuck up 'cause I'm so tired. I can't take it anymore. And with all the liars. Like a prisoner of war. I don't want your sympathy. I don't want your honesty. I just want to get some peace of mind. It's only in my head. As I roll over and play dead. I don't want to hear it anymore. I don't want to hear about it. I don't want to scream about it. I don't want to hear it anymore

You're fucking only along for the ride. Where have all the riots gone?. Acid City's model gets pulverized. What's in love is now in debt. On your birth certificate. So strike the fucking match to light this fuse. The television's an obstructionist. And you don't even know that you exist.. Standin' still with suit and tie. You better run for your fucking life. It's not over 'till you're underground. It's not hope before it's too late. This city's burning. It's not my burden. It's not hope before it's too late. There is nothing left to analyze. Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?. And where we will all go when it's too late. Well don't look back. You're not the Jesus of Suburbia. That St. Jimmy is a figment of. Your father's rage and your mother's love. That's made the idiot America. It's not over till you're underground. It's not hope before it's too late. This city's burning. It's not my burden. It's not hope before it's too late
lights out,"Lights out, here comes the night,. As the darkness falls over the light. Lights out, there goes the day. And this fear that comes won't go away. And I'm losing track of time. In the corners of my mind. And I'm living out my private suicide (lights out). Lights out, I lost myself. In the space between heaven and hell. Lights out, finding my way. Till I waste my time losing the way. And I'm losing track of time. In the corners of my mind. And I'm living out my private suicide (lights out). Lights out.... Lights out, here comes the night,. As the darkness falls over the light. Lights out, I lost myself. In the space between heaven and hell. And I'm losing track of time. In the corners of my mind. And I'm living out my private suicide (lights out)"
like a rat does cheese,"Suck my dick until your lips fall off.. Don't make me ask again please.. Put it down your throat until it makes you cough.. Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese.. Well you're from the south your a special kind of girl.. Put my nuts in your mouth just like you was a squirrel.. Work on the shaft, cradle on the balls.. Baby just don't bite it, get it on get it on.. Suck my dick until your lips fall off.. Don't make me ask again please.. Put it down your throat until it makes you cough.. Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese.. Well why don't you go down and a hook a brother up?. Swallow it on down or spit it in a cup.. Wipe it on your t-shirt let it dribble down your chin.. Smoke a couple Newports and suck that dick again.. Suck my dick until your lips fall off.. Don't make me ask again please.. Put it down your throat until it makes you cough.. Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese."
like a rolling stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine. You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?. People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall"". You thought they were all kiddin' you. You used to laugh about. Everybody that was hangin' out. Now you don't talk so loud. Now you don't seem so proud. About having to be scrounging for your next meal.. How does it feel. How does it feel. To be without a home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?. You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely. But you know you only used to get juiced in it. And nobody's ever taught you how to live on the street. And now you're gonna have to get used to it. You said you'd never compromise. With the mystery tramp, but now you realize. He's not selling any alibis. As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes. And say do you want to make a deal?. How does it feel. How does it feel. To be on your own. With no direction home. A complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?. You never turned around to see the frowns. on the jugglers and the clowns. When they all did tricks for you. You never understood that it ain't no good. You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you. You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat. Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat. Ain't it hard when you discover that. He really wasn't where it's at. After he took from you everything he could steal.. How does it feel. How does it feel. Ham on your own. With no direction home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?. Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people. They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made. Exchanging all precious gifts. But you'd better take your diamond ring,. you'd better pawn it babe. You used to be so amused. At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used. Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse. When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose. You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.. How does it feel. How does it feel. To be on your own. With no direction home.

longview,"I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on. I change the channels for an hour or two.. Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit. I'm sick of all the same old shit.. In a house with unlocked doors. and I'm fuckin' lazy.. Bite my lip and close my eyes. Take me away to paradise.. I'm so damn bored I'm going blind!!!. And I smell like shit.. Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving. I'm sure as hell can't do it by myself.. I'm feeling like a dog in heat. Barred indoors from the summer street.. I locked the door to my own cell. And I lost the key. Bite my lip and close my eyes. Take me away to paradise.. I'm so damn bored I'm going blind!!!. And I smell like shit.. I got no motivation. Where is my motivation?. No time for the motivation. Smoking my inspiration.. I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling.. Call me pathetic. Call me what you will.. My mother says to get a job. But she doesn't like the one she's got.. When masturbation's lost its fun. You're fucking lonely!. Bite my lip and close my eyes. Take me away to paradise.. I'm so damn bored I'm going blind. And loneliness has to suffice.. Bite my lip and close my eyes. slipping away to paradise.. Some say 'Quit or I'll go blind.'. But it's just a myth"

misery,"Virginia was a ""lot lizard"" from F.L.A.. She had a compound fracture in the ""trunk"". It started when she ran away. Thumbs out on the interstate. She hitched a ride to misery. ""Mr. Whirly"" had a catastrophic incident. He fell into the city by the bay. He liquidated his estate. Now he sleeps upon the Haight. Panhandling misery. He's gonna get high, high, high. When he's low, low, low. The fire burns out from better days. And she screams why, oh, why. I say I don't know. The catastrophic hymns from yesterday. Of misery. Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam. He ran the drug cartel in ""tinseltown"". They found him in a cadillac. Bludgeoned with a baseball bat in the name. Of misery. Gina hit the road to New York City. Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked. She stopped in Vegas to elope. With Virginia and the dope. And kissed the bride eternally. And they're gonna get high,high, high. When they're low, low, low. The fire burns from better days. And he screamed why, oh, why. I said I don't know. The catastrophic hymns from yesterday. Of misery. Hell hounds on your trail now once again... boy. It's groping on your leg until it sleeps. The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow. Because it's not what you make... it's what you leave. And we're gonna get high, high, high. When I'm low, low, low. The fire burns from better days. And she screamed why, oh, why. I said i don't know. The catastrophic hymns from yesterday. Of misery"
missing you,"Waking up, feeling naked. In my closest idle room that's vacant. Lost my nerve, it's unnerving. I know there's something I'm forgetting. I searched the moon I lost my head. I even looked under the bed. I punched the walls, I hit the streets. I'm pounding the pavement. Looking. I'm missing you. I'm missing you. You're not around. And I am a complete disaster. I'm missing you. Remember, it was the first time. I told you I loved you at the bus station. Don't forget, 'cause it's not over. I'm not lost 'cause I'm just missing you. I searched the moon I lost my head. I even looked under the bed. I punched the walls, I hit the streets. I'm pounding the pavement. Looking. I'm missing you. I'm missing you. You're not around. And I am a complete disaster. I'm missing you. Well she's my blood,. And she's my soul. I get so lost,. Out in the cold. I feel so far,. Like this lone star. It gets so hard,. When I'm missing you. I'm missing you. I'm missing you. You're not around. And I am a fucking disaster. I'm missing you"

Is it me or am I going crazy?. It's just you. This dirty city is my sugar town. Sugar town. My little angel of death is my nightlife. Come inside. It's just you. Sugar town. Better make a move before I get bored. If you wanna explore my vocal chord. Baby girl on coke. Go dance in the cooch. One hand on my knee. One hand on the hooch. Why don't you stick around for one more round?. This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown. 'Cause I'm a ringleader. I run the show. And only when I tell you will it be time to go.

no one knows,Why should my fun have to end?. For me it's only the beginning. I see my friends begin to age. A short countdown to there end. Call me irresponsible. Call me habitual. But when you think of me. Do you fill your head with schemes. Better think again. Cause no one knows. I don't want to cause no harm. But sometimes my actions hurt. Is there something I should find. To make plans for forever. Does it seem like all your memories fade. You soak up knowledge to fill the space. And still my answer remains.... I don't know.

no pride,Oh well I am just a mutt. And nowhere is my home. Where dignity's a land mine. In the school of lost hope. I've panhandled for life because. I'm not afraid to beg. Hand me down your lost and founds. Of second hand regret. You better swallow your pride. Or you're gonna choke on it. You better digest your values. Because they turn to shit. Honor's gonna knock you down. Before your chance to stand up and fight. I know I'm not the one. I got no pride. Sects of disconnection. And traditions of lost faith.

Sing us a song for me

state of shock,"I'm going in to a state of shock. I can twist, I can hardly walk. And I'm holding on for life. Should I be concerned?. My eyes are rolling in the back of my head. I'm black and blue and I'm in the red. And the silence is so loud. Should I be concerned?. We want to go to heaven. But no one wants to die. Defy your judgement and demons. And save your last goodbye. My tears are putting out my cigarette. And I'm singing out the alphabet. The way I remember. Should I be concerned?. Making plans for my amnesia. I'm going under anesthesia. I'm holding on for life. Should I be concerned?. We want to go to heaven. But no one wants to die. Defy your judgement and demons. And save your last goodbye.

I've been running all my life. Just to find a home that's for the restless. And the truth that's in the message. Making my way, away, away. Cause I'm still breathing. Cause I'm still breathing on my own. My head's above the rain and roses. Making my way, away. Cause I'm still breathing. Cause I'm still breathing on my own. My head's above the rain and roses.

the ballad of wilhelm fink,Said that I'd meet you. At the Berkeley Marina. 3 AM when no one will be found. All I got in mind. Is a Boone's Farm jug of wine. Smash a bottle in the parking lot.

the forgotten,"We're in the worlds of forgotten. And lost inside your memory. You're dragging on, your heart's been broken. Cause we all go down in history. Where in the world did the time go?. It's where your spirit seems to roam. Like losing faith to our abandon. Or an empty hallway from a broken home. Don't look away. From the arms of a bad dream. Don't look away. Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen. I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted. Another moment trapped in time. I can't quite put my finger on it. But it's like a child that was left behind. So we're in the worlds of forgotten. Like soldiers from a long lost war. We share the scars from our abandon. And what we remember becomes folklore. Well don't look away. From the arms of a bad dream. Don't look away. Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen. Don't look away. From the arms of a moment. Don't look away. From the arms of tomorrow. Don't look away. From the arms of a moment. Don't look away. From the arms of love. Don't look away. From the arms of a bad dream. Don't look away. Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen. Don't look away. From the arms of a moment. Don't look away. From the arms of tomorrow. Don't look away. From the arms of a moment. Don't look away.

I thought it was the street. So I look down at my shoes. They were on the wrong feet. I find it hard to be myself. (Can you please explain?). I do not think that it's my health. (You're the one to blame). You're the one I wish I had. And now my girlfriend is getting mad. (I cannot call this sane). Today as I was walking down. You bumped into me. You said ""excuse me"" and walked away. As I dropped to my knees. I prayed to the being in the sky. That my parents told me of. I asked about you but no reply. No clues about your love!. My girlfriend left me on the phone. I'm pathetically left here alone. (I cannot call this sane). Can we find a way. So that you can stay. I think I'm gonna Pop"
the one i want,Sitting in my room last night. Staring at the mirror. I couldn't find a reason why. I couldn't be near her. 'Cause you are the one that started. To make me feel this way.

Because you are the one that I want 4x. Now you know how I feel. This love is forever. You make my life seem so unreal. Will I ever get better? .... Because you are the one that I want
the saints are coming,"There is a house in New Orleans. They call the Raising Sun. It's been the ruin of many a poor boy. And god, i know i'm one. I cried to my daddy on the telephone. How long now.

Until the clouds unroll and you come home. The line went. But the shadows still remain since your descent. Your descent. The saints are coming, the saints are coming. I say no matter how i try, i realise there's no reply. The saints are coming, the saints are coming. I say no matter how i try, i realise there's no reply. New birth to the rebirth. New orleans. Living like birds in magnolia trees. A child on a rooftop, a mother on her knees. Her sign reads. Please, i am an american. A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief. How long now. Until a weather change condemns belief. How long now. When the night watchman lets in the thief. What's wrong now. The saints are coming, the saints are coming. I say no matter how i try, i realise there's no reply. The saints are coming, the saints are coming. I say no matter how i try, i realise there's no reply.

the static age,"Can you hear the sound of the static noise?. Blasting out in stereo. Cater to the class and the paranoid. Music to my nervous system. Advertising love and religion. Murder on the airwaves. Slogans on the brink of corruption. Vision of blasphemy war and peace. Screaming at you. I can't see a thing in the video. I can't hear a sound on the radio. In stereo in the static age. Billboard on the rise in the dawns landscape. Working your insanity. Tragic A'la madness and concrete. Coca cola execution. Conscience on a cross and. You're hearts in a vice. Squeezing out your state of mind. Are what you own that you cannot buy?. What a fucking tragedy, strategy. Screaming at you. I can't see a thing in the video. I can't hear a sound on the radio. In stereo in the static age (x2). Hey, hey it's the static age. This is how the west was won. Hey, hey It's the static age millenium. All I want to know. Is a god-damned thing. Not what's in the medicine. All I want to do is. I want to breathe. Batteries are not included. What's the latest way that a man can die. Screaming Hallelujah?. Singing out ""the dawns early light"". The silence of the rotten, forgotten. Screaming at you. I can't see a thing in the video. I can't hear a sound on the radio. In stereo in the static age (x4). The static age"

tight wad hill,Cheapskate on the hill. A thrill seeker making deals. Sugar city urchin washing time. Town of lunatics. Begging for another fix. Turning tricks for speedballs. One more night.

troubled times,What good is love and peace on earth?. When it's exclusive?. Where's the truth in the written word?. If no one reads it. A new day dawning. Comes without warning. So don't think twice.

Paradise burning. So don't think twice. We live in troubled times. We live in troubled times. We live in troubled times. We run for cover. Like a skyscraper's falling down. Then I wander like a troubled mind. What good is love and peace on earth?. When it's exclusive. Where's the truth in the written word?. If no one reads it. A new day dawning. Comes without warning. So don't look twice. We live in troubled times. We live in troubled times. We live in troubled times. We live in troubled times. We live in troubled times. We live in troubled times

walk away,"This time. I've gotta put my guard down. And pick myself up off the ground. And take the pain. It'll pass. The swelling never really lasts. But the scar remains remind me. That I'm still living. Well it's not too late. Girl, it's really not worth the fight. No one's right. Well it's time to walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Well the bigger that you come. Oh the harder you're gonna fall. Walk away. Walk away. Did you win?. Oh, baby, did you lose?. Now you're gonna lick your wounds anyway. When it comes back to you. When you fall. You're gonna need a parachute. Or a used pair of shoes to go. And walk away. Well it's not too late. Girl, it's really not worth the fight. No one's right. Well it's time to walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Well the bigger that you come. Oh, the harder you're gonna fall. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Eh eh eh eh eh. Walk away. Eh eh eh eh eh. Walk away. Well the bigger that you come. Oh, the harder you're gonna fall. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away"
walking alone,"Come together like a foot in a shoe. Only this time I think I stuck my foot in my mouth. Thinking out loud and acting in vain. Knocking over anyone that stands in my way. Sometimes I need to apologize. Sometimes I need to admit that I ain't right. Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut,. or only say hello. Sometimes I still feel I'm walking alone. Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground,. Yet there's really no one left, that's hanging around. Isn't that another familiar face?. Too drunk to figure out they're fading away"
walking contradiction,"Do as I say not as I do because. The shit so deep you can't run away. I beg to differ on the contrary. I agree with every word that you say. Talk is cheap and lies are expensive. My wallet's fat and so is my head. Hit and run and then I'll hit you again. I'm a smartass but I'm playing dumb. Standards set and broken all the time. Control the chaos behind a gun. Call it as I see it even if. I was born deaf, blind and dumb. Losers winning big on the lottery. Rehab rejects still sniffing glue. Constant refutation with myself. I'm a vicitm of a catch 22. I have no belief. But I believe. I'm a walking contradiction. And I ain't got no right. Do as I say not as I do because. The shit so deep you can't run away. I beg to differ on the contrary. I agree with every word that you say. Talk is cheap and lies are expensive. My wallet's fat and so is my head. Hit and run and then I'll hit you again. I'm a smartass but I'm playing dumb. I have no belief. But I believe. I'm a walking contradiction. And I ain't got no right. I have no belief. But I believe. I'm a walking contradiction.

welcome to paradise,"Dear mother, can you hear me whining?. It's been three whole weeks since that. I have left your home. This sudden fear has left me trembling. Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own. And I'm feeling so alone. Pay attention to the cracked streets. And the broken homes. Some call it slums. Some call it nice. I want to take you through a wasteland. I like to call my home. Welcome to paradise. A gunshot rings out at the station. Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own. It makes me wonder why I'm still here. For some strange reason it's now. Feeling like my home. And I'm never gonna go. Pay attention to the cracked streets. And the broken homes. Some call it slums. Some call it nice. I want to take you through a wasteland. I like to call my home. Welcome to paradise. Dear mother, can you hear me laughing. It's been six whole months since that. I have left your home. It makes me wonder why I'm still here. For some strange reason it's now. Feeling like my home. And I'm never gonna go. Pay attention to the cracked streets. And the broken homes. Some call it slums. Some call it nice. I want to take you through a wasteland. I like to call my home. Welcome to paradise"
westbound sign,Boxed up all her favorite things. Sold the rest at a rainy yard sale. Big plans and leaving friends. And a westbound sign. Weighed out her choices on a scale prevailing. Nothing made sense. Just transportation and a blank decision. She's taking off. No time and no copping out. She's burning daylight and petrol. Blacked out the rearview mirror. Heading westward on. Strung out on confusion road. And ten minute nervous breakdowns. Xanex a beer for thought and she determined. She's taking off. Is it salvation or an escape from discontent. Will she find her name in the california cement. Punched out of the grind that punched her one too many times. Is tragedy 2000 miles away. She's taking off
whatsername,"Thought I ran into you down on the street. Then it turned out to only be a dream. I made a point to burn all of the photographs. She went away and then I took a different path. I remember the face. But I cant recall the name. Now I wonder how Whatsername has been. Seems that she disappeared without a trace. Did she ever marry 'ol Whatshisface. I made a point to burn all of the photographs. She went away and then I took a different path. I remember the face. But I cant recall the name. Now I wonder how Whatsername has been. Remember, whatever. It seems like forever ago. Remember, whatever. It seems like forever ago. The regrets are useless. In my mind. She's in my head. I must confess. The regrets are useless. In my mind. She's in my head. From so long ago. Go-go-go!. And in the darkest night. If my memory serves me right. I'll never turn back time. Forgetting you, but not the time.... .

when i come around,"I heard you crying loud,. all the way across town. You've been searching for that someone,. and it's me out on the prowl. As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself. Well don't get lonely now. And dry your whining eyes. I'm just roaming for the moment. Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight. you been thinking about ditching me. No time to search the world around. Cause you know where I'll be found. When I come around. I heard it all before. So don't knock down my door. I'm a loser and a user. so I don't need no accuser. to try and slag me down. because I know you're right. So go do what you like. Make sure you do it wise. You may find out. that your selfdoubt means nothing was ever there. You can't go forcing something if it's just not right. No time to search the world around. Cause you know where I'll be found. When I come around. When I come around. When I come around. When I come around. When I come around"
when it's time,Words get trapped in my mind. Sorry if I don't take the time. To feel the way I do. Cause the first day you came into my life. My time ticks around you. But then I hear your voice. As a key to unlock all. The love that's trapped in me. So tell me when it's time. To say I love you. All I want is you to understand. That when I take your hand. It's 'cause I want to. We are all born in a world of doubt. But there's no doubt. I figured out. I love you. I feel lonely for. All the losers that will never. Take the time to say. What's really on their mind instead. They just hide away. Yet they'll never have. Someone like you to guide them. And help along the way. Or tell them when it's time. To say I love. So tell me when it's time. To say I love you
who wrote holden caulfield?,A thought burst in my head and I need to tell you. It's news that I for thought. Was it a dream that happened long ago?. I think that I just forgot. Well it hasn't been the first time. And it sure does drive me mad. There's a boy who fogs his world. and now he's getting lazy. There's no motivation. and frustration makes him crazy. He makes a plan to take a stand. but always ends up sitting.. Someone help him up. or he's gonna end up quitting. I shuffle through my mind. To see if I can find. The words I left behind. Was it just a dream. that happened long ago?. Oh well.... Never mind.
why do you want him?,I saw you standing alone. With a sad look on your face. You call him on the phone. Looks like he left you. Without a trace. Tears falling out of your eyes. He's living in a disguise. You've been feeling bad for so long. You wonder if it's right or wrong. Why do you want him? x3. Now many days have gone by. And you still just sit there and cry. You're feeling bad for yourself. His memory will always dwell. You're so obsessed with his love. That's why push came to shove. You've been feeling bad for so long. You wonder if it's right or wrong. Why do you want him? x3
wild one,"She, she's my wild one (wild one). My heart is in panic. Her eyes look so maniac, now. She, little wild one (wild one). My heart is a chaser. She's strung out on razors, now. She give up on Jesus. For living on Venus. All dressed up with nowhere to go. I'm drinking the kool-aid. I jumped on the grenade. Hold on, my mind's gonna blow, hello. She, she's my wild one (wild one). My heart isn't danger, from shadows and strangers, now. She, little wild one (wild one). She's covered in angels, and demons and halos, now. She give up on Jesus. For living on Venus. All dressed up with nowhere to go. I'm drinking the kool-aid. I jumped on the grenade. Hold on, my mind's gonna blow, hello. (wild one). (wild one). She give up on Jesus. For living on Venus. All fucked up with nowhere to go. I'm drinking the kool-aid. I jumped on a grenade. Hold on, my mind's gonna blow,hello. Little wild one (wild one). My heart isn't danger. She's strung out on razors, now. My heart isn't danger. She's strung out on razors, now"
words i might have ate,Now it seems I can't keep my mind of you. My brain drifts back to better days we've been through. Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds. The love I bitched about I finally found. But now it's gone and I take the blame. So there's nothing I can do but take the pain. Why?. Now I dwell on what you remind me of. A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love. As for me... I am blind without a cause. And now I reazlied what I have lost. It was something real that I could have had. Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad. Why?. Tell me the words I might have said. That's pumping pressure deep inside my head. Was it bad enough to be too late?. Just tell me the words I might have ate
working class hero,As soon as you're born they make you feel small. By giving you no time instead of it all. Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. They hurt you at home and they hit you at school. They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool. Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years. Then they expect you to pick a career. When you can't really function you're so full of fear. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV. And you think you're so clever and classless and free. But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. There's room at the top they are telling you still. But first you must learn how to smile as you kill. If you want to be like the folks on the hill. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. If you want to be a hero well just follow me. If you want to be a hero well just follow me
worry rock,Another sentimental argument and bitter love. Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud. Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone. The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride. A knocked down dragged out fight. Fat lips and open wounds. Another wasted night. And no one will take the fall. Where do we go from here?. And what did you do with directions?. Promise me no dead end streets. And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
wow! that's loud,Smell your technicolor in your eyes. Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind. Shake you like a ton of lightning. Staring in the sun is blinding. Like a bottle rocket in the sky. Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes. You're such a beautiful mess tonight. Wow that dirty dress is so loud. Wow that dirty dress is so loud. And it goes. We're in a psychotic red alert. Your bouquet of flowers in the dirt. Radioactive and primal. Nuclear and so delightful. Wearing Dayglow where you know it hurts. Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes. You're such a beautiful mess tonight. Wow that dirty dress is so loud. Wow that dirty dress is so loud. And it goes. Smell your technicolor in your eyes. Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind. Shake you like a ton of lightning. Staring in the sun is blinding. Like a bottle rocket in the sky. Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes. You're such a beautiful mess tonight. Wow that dirty dress is so loud. Wow that dirty dress is so loud. And it goes
x-kid,"Hey, little kid. Did you wake up late one day?. You're not so young, but you're still dumb. And you're numb to your old glory. But now it's gone. I fell in love. But it didn't catch your fall. Then I crashed to a wall. And I fell to pieces on the floor. Now you're sick to death. Bombs away!. Here goes nothing, the shining's over. Hey X-Kid, bombs away!. Here goes nothing, the shining's over and out. Over and out again. I once was old enough. To know better than I was. Too young to care, but who cares?. Probably would but Hollywood is dead and gone. You fell in love. But then you just fell apart. Like a kick in the head. You're an X-Kid and you. Never even got started again. Bombs away!. Here goes nothing, the shining's over. Hey X-Kid, bombs away!. Here goes nothing, the shining's over and out. Over and out.... And you were searching your soul. And you got lost and out of control. You went over the edge of joking. Died of a broken heart!. Hey, little kid. Did you wake up late one day?. You're not so young, but you're still dumb. You're an X-kid and you. Never even got started again. Bombs away!. Here goes nothing, the shining's over. Hey X-Kid, bombs away!. Here goes nothing, the shining's over. Hey X-Kid, bombs away!. Here goes nothing, the shining's over. Hey X-Kid, bombs away!. Here goes nothing, the shining's over and out. Over and out. Over and over and out!"
xmas time of the year,Seasons. Greeting cards and Christmas. Lights light up the city. At the end of the year. This time. I got no resolutions. Giving thanks for nothing. But joy into a new year. Tonight. Friends are what its worth. Peace and love on Earth. And another year. Giving thanks again. The sleigh bells. Deck the halls with good will. Say a prayer for the lost souls. Christmas time of the year. Tonight. Friends are what its worth. Peace and love on Earth. And another year. Giving thanks again. Somewhere. Around a plastic manger. Giving thanks to strangers. Christmas time of the year
you lied,"You gotta problem you just can't hide. Compulsive habits that never seem to die. Your breath is taking up all the air. Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head. Well reality is due. What you say just can't be true. When the story's stretched. And so far fetched. That you're lacking an excuse. You lied. Your mother allowed you just one white lie. But now she's dead and she left you with a problem. Pinnochio has pierced your tongue. Your nose is growing into the third dimension. Well reality is due. What you say just can't be true. When the story's stretched. And so far fetched. That you're lacking an excuse. You lied. Oh, you lied. Well reality is due. What you say just can't be true. When the story's stretched. And so far fetched. That you're lacking an excuse. You lied."
youngblood,"Youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. She's my little youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. Punch-drunken youngblood. She's a loner. Not a stoner. Bleeding heart. And the soul of Miss Teresa. Supernova. Cherry Cola. She's the cedar in the trees in Minnesota. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm a rough boy 'round the edges. Getting drunk, and fallin' in the hedges. She's my weakness, fucking genius. Swear to god and I'm not even superstitious. Youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. She's my little youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. Punch-drunken youngblood. I want to hold you like a gun. We'll shoot the moon into the sun. Alright, alright. Are you stranded?. Like I'm stranded. Do you want to watch the world fall to pieces?. Are you broken?. Like I'm broken. Are you restless?. She said: ""Fuck you, I'm from Oakland! "". Youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. She's my little youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. Youngblood. Punch-drunken youngblood"
