behind blue eyes,"No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man. To be the sad man, behind blue eyes. No one knows what it's like, to be hated. To be fated, to telling only lies. But my dreams they aren't as empty. As my conscience seems to be. I have hours, only lonely. My love is vengeance that's never free. No one knows what it's like, to feel these feelings. Like I do, and I blame you. No one bites back as hard on their anger. None of my pain or woe, can show through. But my dreams, they aren't as empty. As my conscience seems to be. I have hours, only lonely. My love is vengeance that's never free. When my fist clenches, crack it open. Before I use it and lose my cool. When I smile, tell me some bad news. Before I laugh and act like a fool. And if I swallow anything evil. Put your finger down my throat. And if I shiver, please give me your blanket. Keep me warm, let me wear your coat. No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man. To be the sad man, behind blue eyes"
baba o'riley,"Out here in the fields. I fight for my meals. I get my back into my living. I don't need to fight. To prove I'm right. I don't need to be forgiven. Don't cry. Don't raise your eye. It's only teenage wasteland. Sally, take my hand. Travel south cross land. Put out the fire. And don't look past my shoulder. The exodus is here. The happy ones are near. Let's get together. Before we get much older. Teenage wasteland. It's only teenage wasteland. Teenage wasteland. Oh, yeah. Teenage wasteland. They're all wasted!"
who are you,"Who are you?. Who, who, who, who?. Who are you?. Who, who, who, who?. Who are you?. Who, who, who, who?. Who are you?. Who, who, who, who?. I woke up in a Soho doorway. A policeman knew my name. He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight. If you can get up and walk away"". I staggered back to the underground. And the breeze blew back my hair. I remember throwin' punches around. And preachin' from my chair. chorus:. Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). Tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). 'Cause I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who?). I took the tube back out of town. Back to the Rollin' Pin. I felt a little like a dying clown. With a streak of Rin Tin Tin. I stretched back and I hiccupped. And looked back on my busy day. Eleven hours in the Tin Pan. God, there's got to be another way. chorus:. Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). Tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). 'Cause I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who?). Who are you?. Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa .... Who are you?. Who, who, who, who?. Who are you?. Who, who, who, who?. Who are you?. Who, who, who, who?. Who are you?. Who, who, who, who?. I know there's a place you walked. Where love falls from the trees. My heart is like a broken cup. I only feel right on my knees. I spit out like a sewer hole. Yet still recieve your kiss. How can I measure up to anyone now. After such a love as this?. chorus:. Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). Tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). 'Cause I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who?)"

won't get fooled again,"We'll be fighting in the streets. With our children at our feet. And the morals that they worship will be gone. And the men who spurred us on. Sit in judgment of all wrong. They decide and the shotgun sings the song. I'll tip my hat to the new constitution. Take a bow for the new revolution. Smile and grin to the changes all around. Pick up my guitar and play. Just like yesterday. Then I'll get on my knees and pray. We don't get fooled again. The change, it had to come. We knew it all along. We were liberated from the fold, that's all. And the world looks just the same. And history ain't changed. 'Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war. I'll tip my hat to the new constitution. Take a bow for the new revolution. Smile and grin at the changes all around. Pick up my guitar and play. Just like yesterday. Then I'll get on my knees and pray. We don't get fooled again. No, no. I'll move myself and my family aside. If we happen to be left half alive. I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky. For I know that the hypnotized never lie. Do ya. Yeah. There's nothing in the streets. Looks any different to me. And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye. And the parting on the left. Is now the parting on the right. And the beards have all grown longer overnight. I'll tip my hat to the new constitution. Take a bow for the new revolution. Smile and grin to the changes all around. Pick up my guitar and play. Just like yesterday. Then I'll get on my knees and pray. We don't get fooled again. Don't get fooled again, no, no. Yeah. Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss"
pinball wizard,"Ever since I was a young boy. I played the silver ball. From Soho down to Brighton. I must have played them all. But I ain't seen nothing like him. In any amusement hall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure Plays A Mean Pinball!. He stands like a statue. Becomes part of the machine. Feeling all the bumpers. Always playing clean. He plays by intuition. The digit counters fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. He's a pinball wizard. There has to be a twist. A pinball wizard. Got such a supple wrist. How do you think he does it. I Don'T Know!. What makes him so good. Ain't got no distractions. Can't hear no buzzers and bells. Don't see no lights a-flashin. He plays by sense of smell. Always gets a replay. Never see him fall. That deaf, dumb, and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. I thought I was. The Bally table king. But I just handed. My pinball crown to him. Even on my favorite table. He can beat my best. His disciples lead him in. And he just does the rest. He's got crazy flipper fingers. I never see them fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball"
the seeker,"I've looked under chairs. I've looked under tables. I've tried to find the key. To fifty million fables. chorus:. They call me The Seeker. I've been searching low and high. I won't get to get what I'm after. Till the day I die. I asked Bob Dylan. I asked The Beatles. I asked Timothy Leary. But he couldn't help me either. chorus. People tend to hate me. 'Cause I never smile. As I ransack their homes. They want to shake my hand. Focusing on nowhere. Investigating miles. I'm a seeker. I'm a really desperate man. I won't get to get what I'm after. Till the day I die. I learned how to raise my voice in anger. Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?. I'm happy when life's good. And when it's bad I cry. I've got values but I don't know how or why. I'm looking for me. You're looking for you. We're looking in at other. And we don't know what to do. chorus"

you better you bet,"You better, you better you bet. I call you on the telephone. My voice too rough with cigarettes. I sometimes feel I should just go home. But I'm dealing with a memory. That never forgets. I love to hear you say my name. Especially when you say yes. I got your body right now on my mind. But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex. To the sound of old T-Rex and Who's Next. Chorus. When I say I love you, you say you better. You better, you better you bet. When I say I need you, you say you better. You better, you better you bet. You better, bet your life. Or love will cut you like a knife. I want those feeble minded axes overthrown. I'm not into your passport picture. I just like your nose. You welcome me with open arms. And open legs. I know only fools have needs. But this one never begs. I don't really mind how much you love me. Ooh, a little is alright. When you say. Come over and spend the night. Tonight. Tonight. Chorus: (as above). I lay on the bed with you. We could make some book of records. Your dog keeps licking my nose. And chewing up all those letters. Saying ""you better"". You better bet your life. You better love me, all the time now. You better shove me back into line now. You better love me, all the time now. You better shove me back into line now. I showed up late one night. With a neon light for a visa. But knowing I'm so eager to fight. Can't make letting me in any easier. I know I been wearing crazy clothes. And I look pretty crappy sometimes. But my body feels so good. And I still sing a razor line every time. And when it comes to all night living. I know what I'm giving. I've got it all down to a tee. And it's free. Chorus: (as above)"
how can you do it alone,"Saw a man about fifty or so. He looked lonely but his eyes were bright. He was walking up the Holland Park Road. And I stopped him to ask for a light. He practacally froze when I spoke. But eased when he saw my cigarette. Then I saw as he lit up my smoke. Beneath his coat he was naked and wet. With eyes full of shame. For he knew that I knew. He slumped to the wall with a moan. I said ""I know there's no name. For what you go through. But how can you do it alone."". I crossed the street to the local newstore. Flicked through some cheap magazines. Beside me some schoolkid I saw. Push some girlie mags down into his jeans. The shop girl was watching amazed. Asked me to call for the police.. She screamed at his blushing young face. And he escaped into the streets.. With eyes full of shame etc.. Do it alone, how can you do it alone,. I need your help, so I can do it by myself.. Do it alone, don't have to breathe down a phone. I ain't got a clue, 'bout the things that you do. But how...can you do it alone.. How can you do it.. Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower. And wasn't too keen on me sharing. She came out well after an hour. And by that time I was past caring. Some women it seems have the knack. Of attaining that stars in their dreams. They simply relax and lay back. While people like us scratch our jeans.. With eyes full of shame. And I know it must show. I slump - and I fall and I groan. Will somebody explain. What I need to know. How can you do it alone.. How can you do it.. How can you do it without any help. How can you do it all by yourself.."
cut my hair,"Why should I care. If I have to cut my hair?. I've got to move with the fashions. Or be outcast.. I know I should fight. But my old man he's really alright,. And I'm still living at home. Even though it won't last.. Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents. Five inches long.. I'm out on the street again. And I'm leaping along.. I'm dressed right for a beach fight,. But I just can't explain. Why that uncertain feeling is still. Here in my brain.. The kids at school. Have parents that seem so cool.. And though I don't want to hurt them. Mine want me their way.. I clean my room and my shoes. But my mother found a box of blues,. And there doesn't seem much hope. They'll let me stay.. Zoot suit, etc.. Why do I have to be different to them?. Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend,. We have the same old row, again and again.. Why do I have to move with a crowd. Of kids that hardly notice I'm around,. I work myself to death just to fit in.. I'm coming down. Got home on the very first train from town.. My dad just left for work. He wasn't talking.. It's all a game,. 'Cos inside I'm just the same,. My fried egg makes me sick. First thing in the morning.."

And you won't get luckier the way you're going. Your horseshoe's rusty and your mirror's cracked. You walk under ladders then you walk right back. (chorus). When you dropped that little pin. Never thought what a mess it'd get you in. Little pin, little pin, bring me luck. Because I stopped to pick you up. (chorus). Well now, little girl, I'm helping you.

Love, Reign o'er me, rain on me, rain on me.. On the dry and dusty road. The nights we spend apart alone. I need to get back home to cool cool rain.. I can't sleep and I lay and I think. The nights are hot and black as ink. Oh God, I need a drink of cool cool rain.. Only love. Can bring the rain. That makes you yearn to the sky.. Only love. Can bring the rain. That falls like tears from on high.. Love Reign O'er me."

Again and again and again. Join in and sing. Now, don't be ashamed. Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain. Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain. Let it rain. Let it rain.

Inside outside. Leave me alone.. Inside outside. Nowhere is home.. Inside outside, Where have I been?. Out of my brain on the five fifteen.. On a raft in the quarry. Slowly sinking.. On the back of a lorry. Holy hitching.. Dreadfully sorry. Apple scrumping.. Born in the war. Birthday punching.. He man drag. In the glittering ballroom. Gravely outrageous. In my high heel shoes. Tightly undone. They know what they're showing. Sadly ecstatic. That their heroes are news.. Why should I care?."

Of the planet we call Earth. In suspended animation. My childhood passed me by. If I speak without emotion. Then you know the reason why. Knowledge of the universe. Was fed into my mind. As my adolescent body. Left its puberty behind. And everything I know is what I need to know. And everything I do's been done before. Every sentence in my head. Someone else has said. At each end of my life is an open door. Automatically defrosted. When manhood came on time. I became a man. I left the ""ice school"" behind. Now I'm to begin. The life that I'm assigned. A life that's been used before. A thousand times. I have a feeling deep inside. That somethin' is missing. It's a feeling in my soul. And I can't help wishing. That one day I'll discover. That we're living a lie. And I'll tell the whole world. The reason why. But, until then, everything I know is what I need to know. And everything I do's been done before. Every idea in my head. Someone else has said. At each end of my life is an open door."

a little is enough,They say that love often passes in a second. And you never can catch it up. So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned. But it's clear that the match is rough. Common sense 'd tell me not to try 'n continue. But i'm after a piece of that diamond in you. So keep an eye open. My spirit ain't broken. Your love's so incredible. Your body so edible. You give me an overdose of love. Just a little is a enough. I'm connoisseur of champagne cognac. The perfume nearly beats the taste. I eat an oyster and I feel the contact. But more than one would be a waste. Some people want an endless line that's true. But all I have's a little time with you. A smile sets me reeling. A kiss feels like stealing. Your love is like heroin. This addict is mellowing. I can't pretend that I'm tough. Just a little is enough. Just like a sailor heading into the seas. There's a gale blowing in my face. The high winds scare me but I need the breeze. And I can't head for any other place. Life would seem so easy on the other tack. But even a hurricane won't turn me back. You might be an island. On the distant horizon. But the little I see. Looks like heaven to me. I don't care if the ocean gets rough. Just a little is enough. Common sense 'd tell me not to try and continue. But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you. So keep an eye open. My spirit ain't broken. Your love's so incredible. Your body so edible. You give me an overdose of love. A little is enough.
a man in a purple dress,"How dare you wear robes and reside. How dare you cover your head to hide. Your face from God. How dare you smile from behind your beard. To hide the fact that your hearts are feared. And wave your rod. How dare you be the one to assess. Me in this godforsaken mess. You, a man in a purple dress. A man in a purple dress. When you place your frown. Between my God and prayer. However grand your crown. Or dignified your hair. Men above men all prats. In your high hats. You priest, you mullah so high. You pope, you wise rabbi. You're invisible to me. Like vapor from the sea. I lovingly mock you noble lords. We all dress up to grand awards. I do that as well. I dare condemn your fashion sense. At least you're not astride the fence. That wouldn't sell. But I will deliver this address. Your souls conditioned don't impress. You, a man in a purple dress. A man in a purple dress"
a man is a man,"You talk about crazy affairs. You talk about your life as though it mattered. You get attention 'cos you block the stairs. Bragging about some bottles you have shattered. Well I met a man who really lives. He really does it all. But what really matters is the heart he gives. He makes your talk seem small. When a man is a man. He doesn't act to a plan. He don't have to perform like John Wayne in some B feature flick. A man is a man. When he can offer his hand. Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick. I know a man who's a man. Can't you sometimes crack a smile. Do you think if you did we would run and tell. I know one day your big villian style. Will collapse as they turn the key in the door of your cell. I know a man who was once like you. But he opened his heart. No one is totally bad right through. He's just another part. When a man is a man. And he drinks 'til he's canned. He can drop to the floor, he can weep, we won't ask the price. A man is a man. He can fall he can stand. We won't love him more if he keeps his soul on the ice. I know a man who's a man. Every one of us is looking for fame. He's a looker. He's a dresser. He's a genius under pressure. I know a man who could tighten your rein. He's a father. He's a brother. He's a rock. He's a lover. He's a man he's a man. He doesn't act to a plan. He don't have to get hitched to a train in some muscle beach trick. A man is a man. When he can offer his hand. Not afraid of apprearing insane if he can't break a brick. Be a man who's a man"

amazing journey,Deaf Dumb and blind boy. He's in a quiet vibration land. Strange as it seems his musical dreams. Ain't quite so bad.. Ten years old. With thoughts as bold as thought can be. Loving life and becoming wise. In simplicity.. Sickness will surely take the mind. Where minds can't usually go.. Come on the amazing journey. And learn all you should know.. A vague haze of delerium. creeps up on me.. All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.. He's dressed in a silver sparked. Glittering gown. And His golden beard flows. Nearly down to the ground.. Nothing to say and nothing to hear. And nothing to see.. Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.. Sickness will surely take the mind. Where minds can't usually go.. Come on the amazing journey. And learn all you should know.. His eyes are the eyes that. Transmit all they know.. Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show. That he is your leader. And he is your guide. On the amazing journey together you'll ride..

I fell right in love with you. Through a hundred hearts you flew. I fell right in love with you. Strange that when infatuation calls. We think that we've got real love in our life. It pumps like the pressure in a station hall. As the express train thunders on by. I fell right in love with you. As the blood came blowing through. I fell right in love with you. Across the room. I saw your eyes. Black widow looking back at me. You held a gun. As children cried. You touched some wires. They shattered me. I was blown into a blue. There'd been nothing I could do. I fell right in love with you. I rose up to the station. Smelt your scent by the door. You stood waiting so patient. Just one wait, then no more. I fell right in love with you. There'd been nothing I could do. I fell right in love with you. Across the room. I saw your eyes. Black window looking back at me. You held a gun. As children cried. You touched some wires.

"blue, red and grey","Some people seem so obsessed with the morning. Get up early just to watch the sun rise. Some people like it more when there's fire in the sky. Worship the sun when it's high. Some people go for those sultry evenings. Sipping cocktails in the blue, red and grey. But I like every minute of the day. I like every second, so long as you are on my mind. Every moment has its special charm. It's all right when you're around, rain or shine. I know a crowd who only live after midnight. Their faces always seem so pale. And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight. They say a suntan never fails. I know a man who works the night shift. He's lucky to get a job and some pay. And I like every minute of the day. I dig every second. I can laugh in the snow and rain. I get a buzz from being cold and wet. The pleasure seems to balance out the pain. And so you see that I'm completely crazy. I even shun the south of France. The people on the hill, they say I'm lazy. But when they sleep, I sing and dance. Some people have to have the sultry evenings. Cocktails in the blue, red and grey. But I like every minute of the day. I like every minute of the day."

cache cache,Did you ever sleep in a bear pit. With apple cores and mice along. Did you ever lay on ice and grit. Or search for a place where the wind was gone. Did you ever tramp up endless hills. Past cosy homes with secret beds. Did you ever dream of a suicide pill. And wake up cold to the smell of bread. Well I have slept there badly twice. And shared my straw with scratchin mice. Although you'll find some deep brown hair. I'll tell you something for nothing. There ain't no bears in there (cache cache). Not a single bear in there (cache cache). Did you ever have to make a draw. For a hard wooden bench or a bed of stone. Did you ever jemmy a stable door. Or scare the horse to escape the snow. Did you ever invade a neat little yard. Wake up the children who hope for ghosts. Did you ever cause their dogs to bark. Their guests to curse their noisy hosts. Don't jump in expectin fun. Don't swagger in there with your elephant gun. Don't enter the cage with wavin chairs. Cos I'll tell you something for nothing. There ain't no bears in there (cache cache). Not a single bear in there (cache cache). Did you ever pass the police at work. And hope that they might take you in. Did you ever wonder why music hurts. When someone plays it aloof to sin. Did you ever believe that a smile could cure. A happy face keep you warm at night?. Were you ever fooled by laughters lure. Only to find that they laughed in spite?. Chorus: (as above). Did you ever finally find a place. A soft warm bed in a room of flowers. And when you finally laid down your face. You found you slept for a hundred hours. A hundred hours.. There ain't no bears in there (cache cache).

christmas,"Christmas. Father:. Did you ever see the faces of children. They get so excited.. Waking up on christmas morning. Hours before the winter suns ignited.. They believe in dreams and all they mean. Including heavens generosity.. Peeping round the door. to see what parcels are for free. In curiosity.. And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.. Doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is.. How can he be saved?. >From the eternal grave.. Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently,. And unaware of everything.. Playing poxy pin ball. picks his nose and smiles and. Pokes his tongue at everything.. I believe in love. but how can men who've never seen. Light be enlightened.. Only if he's cured. will his spirits future level ever heighten.. And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.. Doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is.. How can he be saved?. From the eternal grave.. Tommy can you hear me?. Tommy can you hear me?. Tommy can you hear me?. How can he be saved?. Tommy:. See me, feel me. Touch me, heal me.. See me, feel me. Touch me, heal me!. Tommy can you hear me?. Tommy can you hear me?. Tommy can you hear me?. How can he be saved?"
circles,"Circles, my head is going round in circles. My mind is caught up in a whirlpool, draggin' me down.. Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track. Dizziness will make my feet walk back, walk right back to you.. Everything I do, I think of you. No matter how I try, I can't get back. These circles, leading me back to you. Round and around and around and a.... round and round like a fool I go. Down and down in the pool I go. Draggin' me down. Just one thing could kill the pain of losin' you. But it gets me so dizzy that I'm walkin' right back again. Back to you. Time will tell if these dreams are near his plan. Though I left I'm comin' back. Comin' on back to you. Down and down in the pool I go. Draggin' me down."

cousin kevin,Cousin Kevin. Were on our own cousin. all alone cousin. Let's think of a game to play. Now the grownups have all gone away. You won't be much fun. being blind deaf and dumb.

I'm the school bully!. The classroom cheat. The nastiest playfriend. You ever could meet. I'll stick pins in your fingers. And tread on your feet. Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm. Would change your expression to one of alarm. I'll drag you around by a lock of your hair. Or give you a push at the top of the stairs. I'm the school bully!. The classroom cheat. The nastiest playfriend. You ever could meet. I'll put glass in your dinner. And spikes in your seat

cry if you want,"Once it was just innocence. Brash ideas and insolence. But you will never get away. With the things you say today. But you can try if you want. Dont' you get embarrassed when you read the precious things you said. Many many years ago when life appeared rosy red. No one ever shared your bed. Nothing ever filled your head. Except yourself and little Ted. And scary dreams that you were dead.. Don't you want to hide your face. When going through your teenage books. And read the kind of crap you wrote. About ""Ban the Bomb"" and city crooks. Think about how long it took. To get over that sudden ""Yuk"". When in the mirror you would look. Well now my son you're well in stook. Cry if you want Cry if you want. Didn't you writh in anger when you saw the man in his big car. Didn't you drive a banger and a gallon didn't get you far. Should have been a famous star. But that ain't what you really are. You could shout your last harrah. While they are propping up the bar. Maybe things were better then. Before you led a promised life. Rash commitements and heavy raps and left wing spiel all compromised. You fall in love with other's wives. Drive 'em nuts with empty lies. Angry 'cos you lost the prize. Forgot the color of their eyes.. Cry if you want Cry if you wnat. Let your tears flow Let your past go. Don't you get embarrassed when you think about the way you were. Yesterday the day before when you were young with much to learn. Aren't you glad it's your last term. No more acting lowly worm. You can make the suckers squirm. When you tell them how much you earn. Don't you feel ashamed at all the bitterness you keep inside. Does your ego save your face ""I had a go - I really tried"". Now you know your leaders lied. Does it stop you acting snide. Or are you still a boy that cried. Tears now surely long since dried.. Cry if you want Cry if you want."

I'm dressed right for a beach fight,. But I just can't explain. Why that uncertain feeling is still. Here in my brain.. The kids at school. Have parents that seem so cool.. And though I don't want to hurt them. Mine want me their way.. I clean my room and my shoes. But my mother found a box of blues,. And there doesn't seem much hope. They'll let me stay.. Zoot suit, etc.. Why do I have to be different to them?. Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend,. We have the same old row, again and again.. Why do I have to move with a crowd. Of kids that hardly notice I'm around,. I work myself to death just to fit in.. I'm coming down. Got home on the very first train from town.. My dad just left for work. He wasn't talking..

did you steal my money,I wake up on broken glass. But you left your number. All the members of the cast. Reckon I was lumbered. Did you steal it. Did you screw me. Did you peel it. Did you do me. Are you out there Mr no-one. Is my investment growing. Sorry that I got so drunk. But I wrote you a poem. Did you search me. Did you turn me over. While I cold turkeyed. On the sofa. Did you steal my money. How can we forgive a grievance. Now that we all live with demons. Did you know that poor old veteran. That you kicked out of his bed. Says that he cannot forget you. But he does not wish you dead. Leave his gold watch in reception. He will keep the sixteen stitches in his head. Did you steal his money. Did you pinch my trainer football. Say if you half inched it. Thought I heard a female foot fall. While I washed my kitchen. Did you use me. Why'd I trust you. Why'd you abuse me. I won't bust you. Did you steal my lorry. It fell right off my lorry. Did you pinch my brasso. Nick my gelt you asshole.
dig,"We old ones, have seen two wars. When you're sick and afraid. And there's danger around. Take a pick and a spade. And Cut into the ground. Away from the light. Away from the sound. Make a trap for the beast. Dig his burial mound. Dig for your life. Dig to the death. Dig for Salvation. Till your very last breath. Dig for protection. Dig for release. Dig for resurrection. Dig for peace. We old ones, have seen two wars. When you dream of a laser. That sears your soul. Slices like a razor. Burns like coal. You can bet you'll forget. When the rock starts to roll. And the last meets the least. By the watering hole. Dig it down deep. Dig it out wide. Dig it pleasure. Dig it for pride. Dig it for treasure. Dig it for stones. Dig it for the metal. And dig it for the bones. We old ones, have seen two wars.."

And today I saw you dressed as a flower bed. Last week you had a wig on your head. Directing traffic in the street. And your shoes were too big for your feet. You were wearing disguises. Occasionally a girl surprises me. When she turns out to be you. Wearing disguises. [repeat first verse]. Wearing disguises. Wearing disguises. Wearing disguises. Wearing disguises.

don't let go the coat,I can't be held responsible for blown behaviour. I lost all contact with my only saviour. No-one locked me out because I failed to phone up.

It ain't really true rock and roll unless I'm. Hanging onto you and when I hold it next time. I won't let go the coat. I try to explain but you never understand it. I need your body but I can't just demand it. I won't let go like a stray at heel. (Never let it out of your sight). Every lonely wife knows the way I feel. (Don't let go tonight). Don't let go the coat. Never let go the coat. Your friends all pass for life is just a market. But you have to finish everything you started. So I live my life tearing down the runway. Sure to get the hang of hanging in there someday. Don't let go the coat. Won't get no more chances - forget the war dances. Go blind and hang on - don't try the slang son. Never let go the coat..

dreaming from the waist,"I feel like I want to break out of the house. My heart is a-pumping, I've got sand in my mouth. I feel like I'm heading up to a cardiac arrest. I want to scream in the night, I want a manifest. I've got that wide awake, give-and-take, five o'clock-in-the-morning feeling. I've got the hots for the sluts in the well thumbed pages of a magazine. I want to drive, want to fly like I do in the dreams I've never really been in. I want to hump, want to jump, want to heat up, cool down in a dream machine. I'm dreaming ... from the waist on down. I'm dreaming ... but I feel tired and bound. I'm dreaming ... of a day when a cold shower helps my health. I'm dreaming ... dreaming - of the day I can control myself. Day I can control myself. Sound like a priest and then I'm shooting dice. I'm burning tires with some guy whose hair is turning white. I know the girls that I pass, they just ain't impressed. I'm too old to give up, but too young to rest. I've got that numb-to-a-thumb over-dubbed. Feeling social when the world is sleeping. The plot starts to thicken then I sicken and I feel I'm cemented down. I'm so juiced that the whorey lady's sad sad story has me quietly weeping. But here comes the morning. Here comes the yawning demented clown. I'm dreaming ... but I know it's all hot air. I'm dreaming ... I'll get back to that rocking chair. I'm dreaming ... of the day I can share the wealth. I'm dreaming ... dreaming - of the day I can control myself. Day I can control myself. Hey, hey!. The day I can control myself."

I drank there and I slaved there. I've had enough of the way things have been done. Every man on a razers edge. Someone has used us to kill with the same gun. Killing each other by driving a wedge. My life's a mess I wait for you to pass. I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass. Don't worry smile and dance. You just can't work life out. Don't let down moods entrance you. Take the wine and shout. My life's a mess I wait for you to pass. I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass"

face the face,We've got to face the face. You must have heard the cautionary tales. The dangers hidden on the cul-de-sac trails. >From wiser men who have been through it all. And the ghosts of failures spray-canned up on the wall. We've got to judge the judge. Got to find the finds. We've got to scheme the schemes. Have to line the lines. We must stake the stakes. And show the shown. We must take the takes. And know the known. Try to place the place. Where we can face the face. Face the face-got to. Face the face. You must have tried and the defied belief. Maybe found futility in insular grief. I need your hunger just as you need mine. A million appetites can swallow up time. We've got to fool the fools. And plan the plans. We must rule the rules. Got to stand the stands. We must fight the fight. And fall the falls. We must light the light. And call the calls. We must race the race. So we can face the face. New York! Chicago!. London and Glasgow!. Keep looking!. Keep on cooking. Keep on looking. Gotta stay on this case. Study the pix. Watch the fix. We've got to find the face. Try to place the place where we can face the face.

fortune teller,"Went to the fortune teller. To have my fortune read. I didn't what to tell her. I had a dizzy feeling in my head. Said she'd take a look at my palm. Said ""Son do you feel kind of warm?"". And she looked into her crystal ball. Said ""You're in love."". Said it could not be so,. Not with all the girls I know.. Said when the next one arrives. Looking into her eyes.. I left there in a hurry. Much to my big surprise. The next thing I discovered. The fortune teller told me lies. So I ran back to that woman. Mad as I could be. Told her I didn't see nobody. How she made a fool out of me. At last something shook me. As if it came down from above. And now the fortune teller. And I fell in love."
four faces,"He kicked me out. He kicked me out. He kicked me out. He kicked me out. You must've heard of them, a kind of screwed-up blend. Split personality. Two sides to fight and argue all night. over coffee or tea. Well, that's okay, I wouldn't mind, touche. Or even three, and that's no joke. But with a four-way split, the pocket money's hit. And all of me is broke. I got four heads inside my mind. Four rooms I'd like to lie in. Four selves I want to find. And I don't know which one is me. I get four papers in the box each day. Four girls ringing that I want to date. I look in the mirror and see my face. But I don't know which one is me (I don't know which one is me). He kicked me out, He kicked me out. He kicked me out, He kicked me out. I wake up over here and then I'm over here. I'm trying to brush my teeth. It's little things that are hard. Like starting up the car and I'm still underneath. I get along alright, in fact it's fun at night. I get four-dimensional dreams. But I have to think before I take a drink. I get hungover times sixteen. . There are four records I want to buy. Four highs I'd like to try. Every letter I get I send four replies. And I don't know which one's from me. I've got four hang-ups I'm trying to beat. Four directions and just two feet. I've got a very very secret identity. And I don't know which one is me. You think it's funny, I can tell. Well, you don't understand too well. I get so lonely and turned around. But I can't let it bring me down. I got four hang-ups I'm trying to beat. Four directions and just two feet. Got a very very secret identity. And I don't know which one is me. . ."

guitar and pen,"You're alone above the street somewhere. Wondering how you'll ever count out there. You can walk, you can talk, you can fight. But inside you've got something to write. In your hand you hold your only friend. Never spend your guitar or your pen. Your guitar or your pen. Your guitar or your pen. Your guitar or your pen. Your guitar or your pen. When you take up a pencil and sharpen it up. When you're kicking the fence and still nothing will budge. When the words are immobile until you sit down. Never feel they're worth keeping, they're not easily found. Then you know in some strange, unexplainable way. You must really have something. Jumping, thumping, fighting, hiding away. Important to say. When you sing through the verse and you end in a scream. And you swear and you curse 'cause the rhyming ain't clean. But it suddenly comes after years of delay. You pick up your guitar, you can suddenly play. When your fingers are bleeding and the knuckles are white. Then you can be sure, you can open the door. Get off of the floor tonight. You have something to write. When you want to complain, there's no one can stop you. But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you. You are wearing you heart on your jumping feet. You've got a head start away from the street. But is that what you want, to be rich and be gone?. Could be there's just one thing left in the end. Your guitar and your pen. When you sing to your mum, and you hum and you croon. And she says that she'd like it ""with more of a tune"". And you smash your guitar at the end of the bed. Then you stick it together and start writing again. And you know that it won't be too long 'til your back. To bring her some money, she's calling you ""honey"". Stashed in a bloody great sack. In your Cadillac. You're alone. You're alone. You're alone above the street somewhere. Wondering how you'll ever count out there. You can walk, you can talk, you can fight. But inside you've got something to write. In your hand you hold your only friend. Never spend your guitar or your pen. Your guitar or your pen. Your guitar or your pen. Your guitar or your pen.

helpless dancer,"(Roger's theme). When a man is running from his boss. Who hold a gun that fires ""cost"". And people die from being old. All left alone because they're cold. And bombs are dropped on fighting cats. And children's dreams are run with rats. If you complain you disappear. Just like the lesbians and queers. No one can love without the grace. Of some unseen and distant face. And you get beaten up by blacks. Who though they worked still got the sack. And when your soul tells you to hide. Your very right to die denied. And in the battle on the streets. You fight computers and receipts. And when a man is trying to change. But only causes further pain. You realize that all along. Something in us going wrong.... You stop dancing."

how can you do it alone,"Saw a man about fifty or so. He looked lonely but his eyes were bright. He was walking up the Holland Park Road. And I stopped him to ask for a light. He practacally froze when I spoke. But eased when he saw my cigarette. Then I saw as he lit up my smoke. Beneath his coat he was naked and wet. With eyes full of shame. For he knew that I knew. He slumped to the wall with a moan. I said ""I know there's no name. For what you go through. But how can you do it alone."". I crossed the street to the local newstore. Flicked through some cheap magazines. Beside me some schoolkid I saw. Push some girlie mags down into his jeans. The shop girl was watching amazed. Asked me to call for the police.. She screamed at his blushing young face. And he escaped into the streets.. With eyes full of shame etc.. Do it alone, how can you do it alone,. I need your help, so I can do it by myself.. Do it alone, don't have to breathe down a phone. I ain't got a clue, 'bout the things that you do. But how...can you do it alone.. How can you do it.. Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower. And wasn't too keen on me sharing. She came out well after an hour. And by that time I was past caring. Some women it seems have the knack. Of attaining that stars in their dreams. They simply relax and lay back. While people like us scratch our jeans.. With eyes full of shame. And I know it must show. I slump - and I fall and I groan. Will somebody explain. What I need to know. How can you do it alone.. How can you do it.. How can you do it without any help. How can you do it all by yourself.."
how many friends,"I'm feelin' so good right now. There's a handsome boy tells me how I changed his past. He buys me a brandy. But could it be he's really just after my ass?. He likes the clothes I wear. He says he likes a man who's dressed in season. But no one else ever stares, he's being so kind. What's the reason?. How many friends have I really got?. How many friends have I really got?. How many friends have I really got?. That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?. Suddenly it's the silver screen. And a face so beautiful that I have to cry out. Everybody hears me. But I look like a fool now. With a cry and I shy out. She knows all of my friends. But it's nice to find a woman who can stay home late. Now I think I've reached the end. I wonder in the dead of night - how do I rate?. How many friends have I really got?. How many friends have I really got?. How many friends have I really got?. That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?. Bridge. It's all like a dream you know. When you're still up early in the morning. And you all sit together to watch the sun come through. But things don't look so good. When you could use a bit of warning. Then you know that no one will ever speak the truth about you. How many friends have I really got?. How many friends have I really got?. How many friends have I really got?. That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?. When I first signed a contract. It was more than a handshake then. I know it still is. But there's a plain fact. We talk so much shit behind each other's backs. I get the willies. People know nothing about their own soft gut. So how come they can sum us up. Without suffering all the hype we've known. How come they bum us up. How many friends have I really got?. You can count 'em on one hand. How many friends have I really got?. How many friends have I really got?. That love me, that want me, that'll take me as I am?"
however much i booze,"I see myself on T.V., I'm a faker, a paper clown. It's clear to all my friends that I habitually lie; I just bring them down. I claim proneness to exaggeration. But the truth lies in my frustration. The children of the night, they all pass me by. Have to drench myself in brandy. In sleep I'll hide. But however much I booze. There ain't no way out. There ain't no way out. I don't care what you say, boy. There ain't no way out. I lose so many nights of sleep worrying about my responsibilities. Are the problems that screw me up really down to him or me. My ego will just confuse me. Some day it's going to up and use me. Dish me out another tailor-made compliment. Tell me about some destiny I can't prevent. And however much I squirm. There ain't no way out. There ain't no way out. I don't care what you say, boy. There ain't no way out. Won't somebody tell me how to get out of this place?!. Then the night comes down like a cell door closing. Suddenly I realize that I'm right now, I'm on the scene. While sitting here all alone with a bottle and my head a-floating. Far away from the phone and the conscience going on at me. And on at me, and I don't care what you say. There ain't no way out. There ain't no way out. Now the walls are all clawed and scratched. Like by some soul insane. In the morning I humbly detach myself. I take no blame. I just can't face my failure. I'm nothing but a well fucked sailor. You at home can easily decide what's right. By glancing very briefly at the songs I write. But it don't help me that you know. This ain't no way out. Won't somebody tell me?. I don't care what you say, boy. There ain't no way out. There ain't no way out. There ain't no way out. There ain't no way out. Give me the key, lock it away. There ain't. There ain't. There ain't no way out. There ain't no way out. There ain't no way out."

And if I ever do. The glimpse will be short. Fireball in the sky. No front line battle cries. Can be heard and the button is pushed. By a soul that's been bought. I'll know no war. In and out of reach loft. The medals are lost. They belong to a lone broken sailor. His provinces now. Are the bars of the town. His songs and his poems of failure. For his grandchildren can't see the glory. And his own kids are bored with the story. But for him they'd have burned behind netting. >From the brink they were grabbed. And I'm sure.

I'll know no war.

You will see the end. Imagine events. That occur everyday. Like a shooting or raping or a simple act of deceit. Imagine a fence. Around you as high as prevention. Casting shadows, you can't see your feet. Imagine a girl. With long, flowing hair. And the body of chalky perfection and truth. Imagine a past. Where you wish you had lived. Full of heroes and villians and fools. And you will see the end. You will see the end. And you will see the end. You will see the end. Oh yeah. Imagine a man. Not a child of any revolt.

it's your turn,"Up here on the ledge. I'm getting pushed to the edge. People line up behind me to step into my shoes,. Up here in the precipice. I'm getting close to my nemesis. People fighting each other to jump into my blues. There's a young kid inside me somewhere. He stays up all night, a vampire that never dies,. With the blood and the moon in his eyes. I hear his voice when I'm comin' down,. Sleep is for fools, whe never see the sunrise,. Who never get to live twice.. I was a face in a magazine,. When you were still playin' with your plasticine,. Now you're doggin' my tail, ridin' the slipstream,. You can take the fans and the enemies. The little girls who squeeze and tease. Then pass on their social disease,. Go get your penicillin.. I know you young and dumb,. I know where you're comin' from.. Don't know where you're goin' to,. But I bin there same as you,. You're running out of ideas,. And new hats to try on.. I know you middle age. Same song, different page,. I know what you're goin' through. Made the same mistakes as you,. All you want is some hope. And a shoulder to cry on.. There's a stranger inside me somewhere. That shadow behind me, don't even look like me.. An echoed apology.. He's a wolf in sheep disguise,. I wake up in places I don't even recognize,. Pretender in paradise.. It's your turn, step up and take it. If you've got the guts to hang on. You can make.. C'mon, c'mon, come on,. Ooooh take it!."

music must change,"Deep in the back of my mind is an unrealized sound. Every feeling I get from the street says it soon could be found. When I hear the cold lies of the pusher, I know it exists. It's confirmed in the eyes of the kids, emphasized with their fists. But the high has to rise from the low. Like volcanoes explode through the snow. The mosquito's sting brings a dream. But the poison's derange. The music must change. For we're chewing a bone. We soared like the sparrow hawk flied. Then we dropped like a stone. Like the tide and the waves. Growing slowly in range. Crushing mountains as old as the Earth. So the music must change. Sometimes at night, I wake up and my body's like ice. The sound of the running wild stallion, the noise of the mice. And I wondered if then I could hear into all of your dreams. I realize now it was really the sound of your screams. But death always leads into life. But the street fighter swallows the knife. Am I so crazy to feel that it's here prearranged?. The music must change. It's gets higher and higher. Smouldering like leaves in the 1. Then it bursts into fire. Its rhythm grows strong. It's so new and so strange. Like bells in the clouds, then again. The music must change. But is this song so different?. Am I doing it all again?. It may have been done before. But then music's an open door. Deep in the back of my is an unrealized sound. Every feeling I get from the street says it soon could be found. When I hear the cold lies of the pusher, I know it exists. It's confirmed in the eyes of the kids, emphasized with their fists. But the high has to rise from the low.

When she catches up with me. Won't be no time to explain. She thinks I've been with another woman. And that's enough to send her half insane. Gonna buy a fast car. Put on my lead boots. And take a long, long drive. I may end up spending all my money. But I'll still be alive. And I'm oh so tired of running. Gonna lay down on the floor. I gotta rest some time so. I can get to run some more. She's comin'!. She's comin'!"
naked eye,"Take a little dope. And walk out in the air. The stars are all connected to the brain.. Find me a woman and lay down on the ground,. Her pleasure comes falling down like rain,. Get myself a car, I feel power as I fly,. Oh now I'm really in control,. It all looks fine to the naked eye,. But it don't really happen that way at all,. Don't happen that way at all.. You sign your own name and I sign mine,. They're both the same but we still get separate rooms,. You can cover up your guts but when you cover up your nuts,. You're admitting that there must be something wrong,. Press any button and milk and honey flows,. The world begins behind your neighbor's wall,. It all looks fine to the naked eye,. But it don't really happen that way at all,. Nah nah no, don't happen that way at all.. You hold the gun and I hold the wound,. And we stand looking in each other's eyes,. Both think we know what's right,. Both know we know what's wrong,. We tell ourselves so many many many lies,. We're not pawns in any game, we're not tools of bigger men,. There's only one who can really move us all,. It all looks fine to the naked eye,. But it don't really happen that way at all.."
new song,"You need a new song. I'll set the words up so they tear right at your soul. Don't take me too long. But there's a danger that I'll plagiarize something old. My fingers kill me as I play my guitar. 'Cause I've been chewing down at my nails. My hairline ain't exactly superstar. But there's one thing that never fails. This never fails. I write the same old song with a few new lines. And everybody wants to cheer it. I write the same old song you heard a good few times. Admit you really want to hear it. Whenever I see you. You always treat me like I'm some kind of perfect man. Just 'cause I please you. You explain, but you don't think I can understand. My head is spinning as I scrawl with my pen. 'Cause I've been pouring vodka in my soul. Nothing really ever changes my friend. New lamps for old. New lamps for old. We sing the same old song, just like a vintage car. You can look but you won't ever drive it. We drink the same old wine from a brand new jar. We get hung over, but we always survive it. Turn on the radio. Love is proclaimed. Again and again and again. Join in and sing. Now, don't be ashamed. Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain. Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain. Let it rain. Let it rain. We hum the same old lines to a different crowd. And everybody wants to cheer it. We run on endless time to reach a higher cloud. But we never ever seem to get near it. We sing the same old song."
no road romance,"When you look through the lights to the stage, you see the man of your dreams. You think his life's full of parties and love, but it's not what it seems. If you could see in his room right now, you'd see how much love is showed. There's never really any romance on the road. His forehead seems cut in two, by the crease in his brow. He chews his nails as he fidgets, just trying to settle on down. The TV channels keep flippin', his adrenaline slowed. There's never really any romance on the road, oh no. There's never romance on the road, only frustration and overload. He could fall in love, but he'd never know. For she's only riding, and he's only hiding. He's sure to ask, 'cause she won't say no. But there's never really any romance on the road. He was up in the bar straight-backed, did you see him before?. Did he sign you his name, come with me, listen in at his door. Hear himself so drunk calling home, can't remember the code. You know, there's never really any romance on the road, oh no no no. He's held some beautiful girls in his arms, but now he clutches his bunk. For all the good that they're doing him now he might as well be a monk. For his memories ain't worth a thing, 'till he's old and he's gone. And his past never quite catches up, the show's moving on. Did he say he kept a picture of a blonde haired girl who'd been kind. When he was last home his own daughter brought it into his mind. Maybe closing bars and jets, paid some debts that he owed. But there's never really any romance on the road. There's never romance on the road, only frustration and overload. He's never learned a thing from the dust that blowed. On stage for an hour, on a laser beam tower. But you know he slept while the neon glowed. There's never really any romance on the road. There's never romance on the road, only frustration and overload. He could fall in love, but he'd never know. For she's only riding and he's only hiding. He's sure to ask, but she won't say no. There's never really any romance on the road"
now i'm a farmer,"I've got a spade and a pick-axe. And a hundred miles square of land to churn about. My old horse is weary but sincerely. I believe that he can pull a plough. Well I've moved into the jungle of the agriculture rumble,. To grow my own food. And I'll dig and plough and scrape the weeds. Till I succeed in seeing cabbage growing through. Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging. Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging. It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming. How calming and balming the effect of the air. Well, I farmed for a year and grew a crop of corn. That stretched as far as the eye can see. That's a whole lot of cornflakes,. Near enough to feed New York till 1973. Cultivation is my station and the nation. Buys my corn from me immediately. And holding sixty thousand bucks, I watch as dumper trucks. Tip New York's corn flakes in the sea. Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging. Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging. It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming. How calming and balming the effect of the air. Now look here son. The right thing to say. Isn't necessarily what you want to say. The right thing to do. Isn't necessarily what you want to do. The right things to grow. Ain't necessarily what you want to grow. Your own happiness. Doesn't necessarily teach you what you want to know. Well I'm suntanned and deep, so's the horse. And my hands are deeply grained. Old horse is a-grazing, it's amazing. Just how lazily he took the strain. Well my pick and spade are rusty,. Because I'm paid on trust to leave my square of cornfield bare. It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming. How calming and balming the effect of the air. When you grow what I grow. Tomatoes, potatoes, stew, eggplants .... Potatoes, tomatoes ... gourds."

And stuck them on my wall. And now my nights ain't quite so lonely. In fact I, I don't feel bad at all. Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful. Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night.

I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know. chorus. There's lots of French fries, disapproving eyes in the U.S.A.. We've had no shows since I don't know. There's just one thing wrong, we've been here too long. The money's all gone. chorus. There's kangaroos and we're bad news in Australia. Thrown off the plane for drinking beer.

pure and easy,"There once was a note, pure and easy,. Playing so free, like a breath rippling by.. The note is eternal, I hear it, it sees me,. Forever we blend it, forever we die.. I listened and I heard music in a word,. And words when you played your guitar,. The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,. And a child flew past me riding in a star.. As people assemble,. Civilization is trying to find a new way to die,. But killing is really merely scene changer,. All men are bored with other men's lies.. I listened and I heard music in a word,. And words when you played your guitar,. The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,. And a child flew past me riding in a star.. Gas on the hillside, oil in the teacup,. Watch all the chords of life lose their joy,. Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness,. The note that began all can also destroy.. We all know success when we all find our own dreams,. And our love is enough to knock down any walls,. And the future's been seen as men try to realize,. The simple secret of the note in us all.. I listened and I heard music in a word,. And words when you played your guitar,. The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,. And a child flew past me riding in a star.. There once was a note, listen (x 12)."

There are bands killing chickens,. My hero's getting pushed around, 'round, 'round.. I don't know if I trust you as you try to shoot me down,. Before I walk on the water,. Put the money down, down, down,. Put the money down.. It was a beautiful day in Columbus when the fences fell. But the five loaves and the fishes ain't going to be much help,. I got a hungry juggler here who wants to be at the head,. Before he walks the water he wants his bread.. Take a glass of that light brown ale and a purple pill,. If the air don't get you too sure as hell the pill will,. Oh, mommy, mommy, please may I go downtown?. He's gonna walk on the water,. Put the money down,. Put it down, before I walk on the water,.

sally simpson,"Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced. that Sally couldn't go to the meeting.. He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce. and she ran inside weeping..

So Sally decided to ignore her dad,. and sneak out anyway!. She spent all afternoon getting ready,. and decided she'd try to touch him,. Maybe he'd see that she was free. and talk to her this Sunday.. She knew from the start. Deep down in her heart. That she and Tommy were worlds apart,. But her Mother said never mind your part.... Is to be what you'll be.. She arrived at six and the place was swinging. to gospel music by nine.. Group after group appeared on the stage. and Sally just sat there crying.. She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture. right in the very front row. And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge. ran on and said 'here we go!'. The crowd went crazy. As Tommy hit the stage!. Little Sally got lost as the police bossed. The crowd back in a rage!. But soon the atmosphere was cooler. as Tommy gave a lesson.. Sally just had to let him know she loved him. and leapt up on the rostrum!. She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure. and touched him on the face. Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man,. threw her of the stage.. She knew from the start. Deep down in her heart. That she and Tommy were worlds apart,. But her Mother said never mind your part.... Is to be what you'll be.. Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,. mingling with her tears,. Tommy carried on preaching. and his voice filled Sally's ear. She caught his eye she had to try. but couldn't see through the lights. Her face was gashed and the ambulance men. had to carry her out that night.. The crowd went crazy. As Tommy left the stage!.

saturday night's alright (for fighting),"It's getting late have you seen my mates,. Go on and tell me when the boys get here.. It's seven o'clock and I want to rock,. Want to get a belly full of beer.. My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys. And my old lady she don't care. My sister looks cute in her braces and boots with a handful of grease in her hair.. Hey... Don't give us none of your aggravation,. We've had it with your discipline..

Saturday Nights Alright... Alright, Alright!. Well, we're packed pretty tight in here tonight and I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right.. I may use a little muscle to get what I need, and sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me!"".. A couple of the sounds that I really like are the sound of a switchblade and a motorbike.. I'm a juvenile product of the working class, who's best friend floats in the bottom of a glass.. Don't give us none of your aggravation, we've had it with your discipline.. Saturday Night's Alright for fighting, to get a little action in.. I get about as oiled as a diesel train, gonna set this dance alight.. Cause Saturday Night's the night I like,.

sea and sand,"Here by the sea and sand. Nothing ever goes as planned,. I just couldn't face going home. It was just a drag on my own.. They finally threw me out. My mother got drunk on stout,. My dad couldn't stand on two feet,. As he lectured about morality.. Now I guess the families complete,. With me hanging round on the street. Or here on the beach.. The girl I love. Is a perfect dresser,. Wears every fashion. Gets it to the tee.. Heavens above,. I got to match her. She knows just how. She wants her man to be. Leave it to me.. My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked. Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck. I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat. I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet.. I see her dancing. Across the ballroom. UV light making starshine. Of her smile.. I am the face,. She has to know me,. I'm dressed up better than anyone. Within a mile.. So how come the other tickets look much better?. Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter.. How come the girls come on oh so cool. Yet when you meet 'em, every one's a fool?. Come sleep on the beach. Keep within my reach. I just want to die with you near. I'm feeling so high with you here.. I'm wet and I'm cold. But thank God I ain't old. Why didn't I ever say what I mean?. I should have split home at fifteen.. There's a story that the grass is so green,. What did I see?. Where have I been?. Nothing is planned, by the sea and the sand."

silas stingy,"Once upon a time there lived an old miser man. By the name of Silas Stingy. He carried all his money in a little black box. Which was heavy as a rock. With a big padlock. All the little kids would shout. When Silas was about. Chorus:. Money, money, money bags. Money, money, money bags. There goes mingy Stingy. There goes mingy Stingy. Money, money, money bags. Money, money, money bags. There goes mingy Stingy. There goes mingy Stingy. Silas didn't eat, which was just as well. He would starve himself for a penny. He wore old clothes and he never washed. 'Cause soap cost a lot. And the dirt kept him hot. All the little kids would shout. When Silas was about. (chorus). In the back of his head. Was a voice that said. ""Someone will steal it all. You'll be lying in the gutter with an empty box. The thieves will be having a ball"". (chorus). He bought a safe to put the box in. And a house to put the safe in. And a watchdog on a chain to make quite sure. And his face was very funny. When he counted up his money. And he realized he hadn't any more. (chorus)."
sister disco,"As I walked through that hospital door. I was sewn up like a coat. I got a smile from the bite of the wind. Watched the fresh fall of snow. I knew then that my life took a turn. I felt strong and secure. And with adhesive tape over my nose. I felt almost demure. Goodbye Sister Disco. With your flashing trash lamps. Goodbye Sister Disco. And to your clubs and your tramps. Goodbye Sister Disco. My dancing's left you behind. Goodbye, now you're solo. Black plastic; deaf, dumb and blind. Bye, goodbye Sister Disco, Now I go. I go where the music where the music fits my soul. And I, I will never let go, I'll never let go. 'Til the echo of the street fight has dissolved. I will choose nightmares and cold stormy seas. I will take over your grief and disease. I'll stay beside you and comfort your soul. When you are lonely and broken and old. Now I walk with a man in my face. Ooh, a woman in my hair. I've got you all lookin' out through my eyes. My feet are a prayer. Goodbye Sister Disco. With your flashing trash lamps. Goodbye Sister Disco. And to your clubs and your tramps.

somebody saved me,"I stood at the door beside her. But she wouldn't let me pass. I was such a boor and I lied to her. I said I didn't really want her ass. I went away in the mud and rain. The gang became snide and laughed. I was slayed but I smiled and the pain. Began to subside at last. And when I got back to my hotel. I wondered if the thunder meant I'd landed in hell. And on the forecourt I slipped and fell. I cracked my stupid head and I heard a bell. I thought ""Hey! Hey, hey!"". Somebody saved me - it happened again. Somebody saved me - I thank you my friend. Somebody saved me - from a fate worse than heaven. 'Cause if I had her for just an hour. I'd have wanted her forever. You would've thought that I'd have learned. Twenty years ago or more. A beautiful girl raised her mouth and yearned. But I didn't know what lips were for. I ran away in the mud and rain. The weather here is never too bright. She'd had an affray with her man and came. For solace and the means to fight. She finally bored with seducing me. And took up with some geezer from the Ealing scene. It nearly killed him like it would've killed me. When her original man snapped his fingers and she obeyed. She obeyed!. Somebody saved me - it happened again. Somebody saved me - I thank you my friend. Somebody saved me - from a fate worse than heaven. 'Cause if I had her for just an hour. I'd have wanted her forever. Somebody saved me, yeah. Somebody saved me. I don't know about guardian angels. All I know about's staying alive. I can't shout about spiritual labels. When little ones die and big ones thrive. All I know is that I've been making it. There've been times I didn't deserve to. Every show there's been more faking it. But right at the point of no return. Somebody saves me - and it happened again. Somebody saved me - I thank you my friend. Somebody saved me - from a fate worse than heaven. 'Cause if I blew it for a single moment. I'd blow it forever. But somebody saved me. I took up the connection once. Made me feel quite aloof. I never could queue to collect my lunch. While I was pursuing the Truth. I left my folks in the mud and rain. It always rains in Sunnyside Road. I lived hippy jokes getting stoned insane. Till the rain looked just like snow. But there was a soul in whom I could depend. He worked himself crazy while I laid in bed. I never leaned on a person like I leaned right then. And when I finally woke up clean. My friend was dead - stone dead. But somebody saved me - it happened again. Somebody saved me - I thank you my friend. Somebody saved me - I ain't ready for heaven. 'Cause if I'd seen you for a second, I'd have wanted to see you forever. But somebody saved me. Somebody saved me. Ooh, somebody saved me"

the quiet one,Everybody calls me the quiet one. You can see but you can't hear me. Everybody calls me the quiet one. You can try but you can't get near me. I ain't never had the gift of gab. But I can't talk with my eyes. When words fail me you won't nail me. My eyes can tell you lies. Still waters run deep so be careful I don't drown you. You've got nothing to hear I've got nothing to say. Sticks and stones may break your bones. But names can never down you. It only takes two words to blow you away. Everybody calls me the quiet one. But you just don't understand. You can't listen you won't hear me. With your head stuck in the sand. I ain't never had time for words that don't rhyme. My headd is in a cloud. I ain't quiet - everybody else is too loud. Still waters run deep so be careful I don't drown you. You've got nothing to hear I've got nothing to say. Sticks and stones may break my bones. But names can never down you. It only takes two words to blow you away..
the real me,"I went back to the doctor. To get another shrink.. I sit and tell him about my weekend,. But he never betrays what he thinks.. Can you see the real me, doctor?. I went back to my mother. I said, ""I'm crazy ma, help me."". She said, ""I know how it feels son,. 'Cause it runs in the family."". Can you see the real me, mother?. The cracks between the paving stones. Look like rivers of flowing veins.. Strange people who know me. Peeping from behind every window pane.. The girl I used to love. Lives in this yellow house.. Yesterday she passed me by,. She doesn't want to know me now.. Can you see the real me, can you?. I ended up with the preacher,. Full of lies and hate,. I seemed to scare him a little. So he showed me to the golden gate.. Can you see the real me preacher?. Can you see the real me doctor?. Can you see the real me mother?. Can you see the real me?."
the seeker,"I've looked under chairs. I've looked under tables. I've tried to find the key. To fifty million fables. chorus:. They call me The Seeker. I've been searching low and high. I won't get to get what I'm after. Till the day I die. I asked Bob Dylan. I asked The Beatles. I asked Timothy Leary. But he couldn't help me either. chorus. People tend to hate me. 'Cause I never smile. As I ransack their homes. They want to shake my hand. Focusing on nowhere. Investigating miles. I'm a seeker. I'm a really desperate man. I won't get to get what I'm after. Till the day I die. I learned how to raise my voice in anger. Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?. I'm happy when life's good. And when it's bad I cry. I've got values but I don't know how or why. I'm looking for me. You're looking for you. We're looking in at other. And we don't know what to do. chorus"
the song is over,"The song is over. It's all behind me. I should have known it. She tried to find me. Our love is over. They're all ahead now. I've got to learn it. I've got to sing out. chorus:. I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces. I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea. I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains. I'll sing my song to the free, to the free. I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces. I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea. I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains. I'll sing my song to the free, to the free. When I walked in through the door. Thought it was me I was looking for. She was the first song I ever sang. But it stopped as soon as it began. Our love is over. It's all behind me. They're all ahead now. Can't hope to find me. (chorus). This song is over. I'm left with only tears. I must remember. Even if it takes a million years. The song is over. The song is over. Searchin' for a note, pure and easy. Playing so free, like a breath rippling by."
there's a doctor,"Father:. There's a doctor I've found. Could bring us all joy!. There's a doctor I've found could cure the boy!. There's a doctor I've found could cure the boy!. There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow,. He lives in this town let's see him tomorrow,. He lives in this town let's see him tomorrow!"
they are all in love,"Where do you walk on sunny times. When the rivers gleam and the buildings shine. How do you feel goin' up hallowed halls. And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls. And they're all in love. And they're all in love. Where do you fit in zzzzip magazine. Where the past is the hero and the present a queen. Just tell me right now where do you fit in. With mud in your eye and a passion for gin. And they're all in love. And they're all in love. Hey, goodbye all you punks. Stay young and stay high. Hand me my checkbook. And I'll crawl out to die. But like a woman in childbirth. Grown ugly in a flash. I'm seen magic and fame. Now I'm recycling trash. And they're all in love. And they're all in love. And they're all in love. And they're all in love."
they made my dream come true,"People died where I performed. People cried when Glass deformed. Shots rang out as the singer yawned. The band played on until the dawn. Lies and drunks and drugs and fools. Tricks and stunts disguise the tools. Was the victim dead, was the blood in pools. Was this not part of show-biz rules?. They made my dream come true"
things go better with coke,Things go better with Coke. Coca-Cola. Things go better with Coke
time is passing,"I'm playing my guitar while my sister bangs the jar. The glass sets up a sound like people laughing. It's going to my brain and it's easing all my pain. I must hear this sound again 'cause time is passing. Mmm.. I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me. The crabs are swimming down among the starfish. The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around. But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing. . Find it, I got to hear it all again. My heart has heard the sound of harmony. Blind to it, as my tears fall again. It's only by the music I'll be free. . There's something in the whisper of the trees. Millions hear it, still they can't believe. There are echoes of it splashing in the waves. As an empire of dead men leave their graves. Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls. Don't listen to me or words from men above. Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greeds. Just hear it in the sound of time a-passing. Find it, I got to hear it all again. My heart has heard the sound of harmony. Blind to it, as my tears fall again. It's only by the music I'll be free."

I think this brain has thought a lot,. Searching, trying to find the crutch,. I think this heart has bled once too often,. This time it's bled a bit too much.. Too much of anything, too much for me,. Too much of everything gets too much for me.. I can't remember before '49,. But I know that '48 was there,. My ears let in what I should speak out,. Hmmm, there's something in the air.. Ooh, I've overloaded on my way,. Bye, bye, bye, bye, you better keep in touch.. Think your ears hear a whole lot of music,. And like me they've caught a bit too much..

trick of the light,"Wide awake in the middle of the night. I wonder how she's feelin'. Is it just a trick of the light. Or is her ceiling peeling?. She's sitting up in bed, shakin' her head. At a copy of ""True Confessions"". Ooh, it must seem like a fairy tale. To a woman of her profession. But was I all right? (was I all right?). Did I take you to the height of ecstasy?. Was I all right? (was I all right?). Did a shadow of emotion cross your face. Or was it just another trick of the light?. But was I all right? (was I all right?). Did I take you to the height of ecstasy?. Was I all right? (was I all right?). Did a shadow of emotion cross your face. Or was it just another trick of the light?. Come on, tell me. What's a nice girl like you doin' in a place like this?. They don't make girls like you no more. And I'd like to get to know you. On closer terms than this. But I guess you've heard it all before. Lady of the night. Won't you steal away with me?. Lady of the night. Won't you steal away with me?. The money's lyin' on the floor, she looks at me. Shakes her head and sighs. Out of time, out the door. Red light shinin' in my eyes. But was I all right? (was I all right?). Did I take you to the height of ecstasy?. Was I all right? (was I all right?). Did a shadow of emotion cross your face. All right?. But was I all right?. All right?."

Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself. Under my thumb, well, I can still look at someone else. It's down to me, the way she talks when she's spoken to. It's down to me, the change has come, she's under my thumb."
unholy trinity,Three kids from the neighborhood. Three different lives. Three different ways to be. The identical smiles. We're not the same. But we can talk. We kiss and link our arms. We take a walk. We watch the tide ever way. Carry our ides through the sea. We hear the music. Remember being free. We are unholy trinity. And love forever. But we are the sea. We are the ocean. We are the free. We are unholy trinity
water,"The foreman over there hates the gang,. The poor people on the farms get it so rough,. Truck drivers drive like the devil,. The policemen they're acting so tough.. They need water,. Good water,. They need water,. And I'm sure there isn't one of us here. Who'd say no to somebody's daughter.. No, no, no, no, no.. The foreman over there hates the gang,. The poor people on the farms get it so rough,. Truck drivers drive like the devil,. The policemen they're acting so tough.. They need water,. Good water,. They need water,. And maybe somebody's daughter.. Indian Lake is burning,. The New York skyline is hazy,. The River Thames is turning dry,. The whole world is blazing.. We need water,. Wow yeah good water,. Ooh we need water,. And maybe somebody's daughter.. Ah gimme gimme good water,. Ah gimme gimme gimme good water,. Ah gimme good water,. Please don't refuse me, mister,.

we close tonight,"How can I explain how I feel. I'm like a little kid running at her heel. She's giving me looks like she thinks I'm a snappy dresser. How can I tell what I should plan. I've never kissed a girl or held her hand. She's waiting for me to move, I've got to impress her. I play guitar in a mainstream band. I've got three red jackets and a Fender jazz. I've got Charlie Parker's autograph. The girl I moved with's turned up on grass. She moved her seat next to mine. But I'm just playing for time. I ain't got the guts to let her see the real me. My confidence eroded away. Over hearing what children say. So I'm trying to make myself seem more appealing. I know your man is in to playing jazz bass. I tried that myself but I need more space. Like to soar and fly like the big Birdman. When I met him last week he shook my hand. Every lie I tell weaves another spell, another road that ends up blind. The Bird that shook my hand was a wanted man, I think you knew that all the time. I came so close to having you for me. But I lost you in the fantasy. I pretended to myself that you were mine already. You waited but deep in your eyes. You were watching me so wordly wise. Then you changed the subject and talked about going steady. I've got 200 records and a big hi-fi. I sit and listen to Ella and Basey all night. I played modern jazz of every variety. You could come and listen but we close tonight"

My how time rushes by,. The moment you're born you start to die,. Time waits for no man,. And your life's spent, it's over before you begin.. As I sit here at my window,. My life comes back to me,. It's been so long since the good days,. It's been so long.. And I count up all the wasted years,. The hopes and the fears,. The laughs and the tears,. And I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what went wrong.. When I was a boy I had the mind of a boy,. But now I'm a man, ain't got no mind at all,. When I was in my teens I had my share of dreams,. But now I'm a man, ain't got no dreams at all.. My how time rushes by,. The moment you're born you start to die,. Time waits for no man,. And your life's spent, it's over before you begin..

whiskey man,"Whiskey Man's my friend, he's with me nearly all the time. He always joins me when I drink, and we get on just fine. Nobody has ever seen him, I'm the only one. Seemingly I must be mad, Insanity is fun. If that's the way it's done. Doctors say he just a figment of my twisted mind. If they can't see my Whiskey Man they must be going blind. Two men dressed in white collected me two days ago. They said there's only room for one and Whiskey Man can't go. Whiskey Man will waste away if he's left on his own. I can't even ring him 'cause he isn't on the phone. Hasn't got a home. Life is very gloomy in this little padded cell. It's a shame there wasn't room for Whiskey Man as well. Whiskey Man's my friend, he's with me nearly all the time. He always joins me when I drink, and we get on just fine. We get on just fine. Just fine"

A policeman knew my name. He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight. If you can get up and walk away"". I staggered back to the underground. And the breeze blew back my hair.

Tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). 'Cause I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who?). I took the tube back out of town. Back to the Rollin' Pin.

why did i fall for that,"The streets of the future littered with remains. Of both the fools and the so called brains. The whole prediction is enough to kill. But only God knows if it won't or it will. Nobody knows why we fell so flat. Some silly creature said we'd never crack. Most would just survive and then bounce back. But the rest are crying ""Why'd I fall for that crap"". Why did I fall for that?. So many rash promises sincerly made. By people who believed that we were being saved. They made us all believe that we were acting white. But the truth is we've forgotten how we used to fight. Nobody knows why we fell so flat. We're impotent and neutered like whining cats. We've found the piper but we've lost the rats. But the kids are crying ""Why'd I fall for that dad?"". Why did you fall?. It never rains under my umbrella. Four minutes to midnight on a sunny day. Maybe if we smile the clock'll fade away. Maybe we can force the hands to just reverse. Maybe a word, maybe maybe is a curse. Nobody knows why we fell so flat. We've never been taught to fight or to face up to facts. We simply believe that we'd remain intact. But history is asking why did you fall for that. Why did you fall?. Why did I fall for that. Why did I fall for that. Why did I fall for that."
won't get fooled again,"We'll be fighting in the streets. With our children at our feet. And the morals that they worship will be gone. And the men who spurred us on. Sit in judgment of all wrong. They decide and the shotgun sings the song. I'll tip my hat to the new constitution. Take a bow for the new revolution. Smile and grin to the changes all around. Pick up my guitar and play. Just like yesterday. Then I'll get on my knees and pray. We don't get fooled again. The change, it had to come. We knew it all along. We were liberated from the fold, that's all. And the world looks just the same. And history ain't changed. 'Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war. I'll tip my hat to the new constitution. Take a bow for the new revolution. Smile and grin at the changes all around. Pick up my guitar and play. Just like yesterday. Then I'll get on my knees and pray. We don't get fooled again. No, no. I'll move myself and my family aside. If we happen to be left half alive. I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky. For I know that the hypnotized never lie. Do ya. Yeah. There's nothing in the streets. Looks any different to me. And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye. And the parting on the left. Is now the parting on the right. And the beards have all grown longer overnight. I'll tip my hat to the new constitution. Take a bow for the new revolution. Smile and grin to the changes all around. Pick up my guitar and play. Just like yesterday. Then I'll get on my knees and pray. We don't get fooled again. Don't get fooled again, no, no. Yeah. Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss"
you,You - you're wasting my time. We're making music we're doing fine. Then a slap in the face takes me back to the starting line. You - your wasting my life. You can't lose what you've already lost. Your arms are open but your legs are crossed. Save me - save me. I'm going down for the third time. Save me - save me. Somebody throw me my next line. Too hot for me to handle. So cold I'm getting nowhere. Pinch me to see if I'm sleeping. Maybe it's only a nightmare. You - why did it have to be you?. Of all those girls I had to choose. You win and I lose. You - you with the poisonous eyes. One look and I'm hooked. One touch and my goose is cooked. Save me - save me. I'm going down for the third time. Save me - save me. Somebody throw me a life line. Too late to change partners. Too late you've got no chance. Too late to change partners. Too late to say I don't dance. You - there's a name for girls like you. You lead me on like a lamb to the slaughter. Then you act like a fish out of water. You - there's a name for girls like you. You've coming on like a steam train. Then you blow me away just like a hurricane. Save me - save me. I'm going down for the last time. Save me - save me. Somebody throw me a lifeline. Save me I'm falling. From the top of the page to the next line. Save me I'm burning. From tips of my toes to my hairline. Too hot for me to handle. So cold I'm getting nowhere. Pinch me to see if I'm sleeping. Maybe it's only a nightmare..
you better you bet,"You better, you better you bet. I call you on the telephone. My voice too rough with cigarettes. I sometimes feel I should just go home. But I'm dealing with a memory. That never forgets. I love to hear you say my name. Especially when you say yes. I got your body right now on my mind. But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex. To the sound of old T-Rex and Who's Next. Chorus. When I say I love you, you say you better. You better, you better you bet. When I say I need you, you say you better. You better, you better you bet. You better, bet your life. Or love will cut you like a knife. I want those feeble minded axes overthrown. I'm not into your passport picture. I just like your nose. You welcome me with open arms. And open legs. I know only fools have needs. But this one never begs. I don't really mind how much you love me. Ooh, a little is alright. When you say. Come over and spend the night. Tonight. Tonight. Chorus: (as above). I lay on the bed with you. We could make some book of records. Your dog keeps licking my nose. And chewing up all those letters. Saying ""you better"". You better bet your life. You better love me, all the time now. You better shove me back into line now. You better love me, all the time now. You better shove me back into line now. I showed up late one night. With a neon light for a visa. But knowing I'm so eager to fight. Can't make letting me in any easier. I know I been wearing crazy clothes. And I look pretty crappy sometimes. But my body feels so good. And I still sing a razor line every time. And when it comes to all night living. I know what I'm giving. I've got it all down to a tee. And it's free. Chorus: (as above)"
you stand by me,"When I'm in trouble. You stand by me. When I see double. You stand by me. You take my side. Against those who lied. You take my side. Gimme back my pride. When I been losing. You stand by me. When I been boozin'. You stand by me. You take my side. Against those who lied. You take my side. Gimme back my pride. I suppose I could make it all my own. I know I'd arrive all skin and all bone. You are the strongest back I've ever known. You carried me, carried me, carried me. You carried me home. When I'm crying. You stand by me. When I am dying"
young man blues,"Oh well a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days. I said a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days. You know in the old days. When a young man was a strong man. All the people they'd step back. When a young man walked by. But you know nowadays. It's the old man,. He's got all the money. And a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days. I said nothing. Everybody knows that a young man ain't got nothin'.. Everybody!. Everybody knows that a young man ain't got nothin'. He got nothin'. Nothin'. Take it easy on the young man. They ain't got nothin' in the world these days. I said they ain't got nothin'!. They got sweet fuck-all!."
zoot suit,"I'm the hippiest number in town and I'll tell you why,. I'm the snappiest dresser right down to my inch wide tie,. And to get you wise I'll explain it to you,. A few of the things that a face is supposed to do.. I wear zoot suit jacket with side vents five inches long,. I have two-tone brogues yeah you know this is wrong.. But the main thing is unless you're a fool,. Ah you know you gotta know, yeah you know, yeah you gotta be cool.. So all you tickets I just want you to dig me,. With my striped zoot jacket that the sods can plainly see,. So the action lies with all of you guys,. Is how you look in the other, the other, yeah, the other cat's eye.. Well don't you see, well don't you see, well don't you see now,. Well don't you see now, come on baby, 'cause don't you see now, oh baby,. Well don't you see now, you drive me wild, hmm hmm hmm, you're crazy-looking now.."
