let it burn,I watched the city burn. These dreams like ashes float away. Your voice I never heard. Only silence. Where were you when our hearts were bleeding?. Where were you? It all crashed down. Now I found that you deceived me. Where are you now?. (How long?) Can you stand the pain?. (How long?) How long will you hide your face?. (How long?) How long will you be afraid?. Are you afraid?. (How long?) Will you play this game?. (How long?) Will you fight or will you walk away?. (How long?) How long will you let it burn?. Let it burn. I watched the city burn. These passions slowly smoldering. A lesson never learned. Only violence. Is your world just a broken promise?. Is your love just a drop of rain?. Where we all just burn like fire?. Are you still there?. Tell me now. (How long?) Can you stand the pain?. (How long?) How long will you hide your face?. (How long?) How long will you be afraid?. Are you afraid?. (How long?) Will you play this game?. (How long?) Will you fight or will you walk away?. (How long?) How long will you let it burn?. Let it burn. Oh. Will you wait till it all burns down?. Will you hide till it all burns down?. Will you run when it all burns down?. Will you fight when it all burns down?. Will you stand when it all burns down?. Will you love when it all burns down?. Will you live when it all burns down?. Will you just let it all burns down?. (How long?) Can you stand the pain?. (How long?) How long will you hide your face?. (How long?) How long will you be afraid?. Are you afraid?. (How long?) Will you play this game?. (How long?) Will you fight or will you walk away?. (How long?) How long will you let it burn?. Let it burn.

But I can hear you now, yeah. I'll never be the same. I'm caught inside the memories. The promises, our yesterdays. And I belong to you. I just can't walk away. Cause after loving you. I can never be the same. And how can I pretend to never know you. Like it was all a dream? No. I know i'll never forget. The way I always felt with you beside me. And how you loved me then, yeah. I'll never be the same. I'm caught inside the memories. The promises, our yesterdays. And I belong to you. I just can't walk away. Cause after loving you. I can never be the same. You left me here.

gone,"Disappear, without a trace. A treasure lost, I can't replace. The only piece that still remains. Is in these scars, is in this pain. I want to save it all. I want to take it all. My heart is holding on. I bleed, I bleed for love. When I'm gone. When I fade away. Is the air I breathe my only legacy?. When I'm gone. In the dark, I am a flame. A passing light, all in vain. I feel the pull, I feel a change. It's over now, it slips away. I want to save it all. I want to take it all. My heart is holding on. I bleed, I bleed for love. When I'm gone. When I fade away. Is the air I breathe my only legacy?. When I'm gone. When I'm gone. When I'm gone. I want to save it all. I want to take it all. My heart is holding on. I bleed, I bleed for love. When I'm gone. When I fade away. Is the air I breathe my only legacy?. When I'm gone. When I'm gone. When I'm gone"
fracture,"[Verse 1]. My wandering heart. Was searching. Your lovely eyes were blinding. Now we're at the edge. Throw me. I hit the ground. Crashing. [Chorus]. Shattered, need you more than ever. Crawling to you, fracture. Lifeless. Falling into madness. Crawling, I am fractured. Fracture. [Verse 2]. This is how the pain of breaking [?]. This does not define us. Calling out. Reaching for you.

not alone,"Slowly fading away. You're lost and so afraid. Where is the hope in a world so cold?. Looking for a distant light. Someone who can save a life. You're living in fear that no one will hear your cries. (Can you save me now?). I am with you. I will carry through it all. I won't leave you I will catch you. When you feel like letting go. Cause you're not, you're not alone. Your heart is full of broken dreams. Just a fading memory. And everything's gone but the pain carries on. Lost in the rain again. When will it ever end. The arms of relief seem so out of reach. But I, I am here. I am with you. I will carry through it all. I won't leave you I will catch you. When you feel like letting go. Cause you're not, you're not alone. And I'll be your hope when feel like it's over. And I will pick you up when your whole world shatters. And when you're finally in my arms. Look up and see love has a face. I am with you. I will carry through it all. I won't leave you I will catch you. When you feel like letting go. Cause you're not, you're not alone. And I will be your hope (not alone). And I will pick you up. And I will be your hope. And I will be your hope. Slowly fading away. You're lost and so afraid. Where is the hope in a world so cold?"
hold me now,Fall asleep to dream of home. Where the waves are crashing. The only place I've ever known. Now the future has me. I see the fire in the sky. See it all around me. I said the past is dead. The life I had is gone. Said won't give up. Until I see the sun. Hold me now. 'Til the fear is leaving. I am barely breathing. Waking up and letting go. To the sound of angels. Am I alive or just a ghost?. Haunted by my sorrows. Hope is slipping throug my hands. Gravity is taking hold. I said I'm not afraid. That I'm brave enough. I will not give up. Until I see the sun. Hold me now. 'Til the fear is leaving. I am barely breathing. Crying out. These tired wings are falling. I need you to catch me. As I burn. As I break. I can't take it anymore. I return to the place where. The water covers over everything. Rescue me somehow. Hold me now. 'Til the fear is leaving. I'm barely breathing. Crying out. These tired wings are falling. I need you to catch me. Hold me now. 'til the fear is leaving. I am barely breathing

And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Passion or coincidence. Once prompted you to say. ""pride will tear us both apart"". Well now pride's gone out the window. Cross the rooftops. Run away. Left me in the vacuum of my heart. What is happening to me?. Crazy, some say. Where is my friend when I need you most?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday.

So afraid to be alone. I tried to let you go. And still I find you lost inside. The darkest part of me. It? s my decent. To know your pain. It? s watching all. I believed fade away.

So reach down and pull me up. Pull me up. Before I am buried beneath. I thought I was climbing out. But it's dragging me down. What's hidden here with me. Thought I was alone. But it pulls me deeper now. I can't escape. Finally breaking. So where are you now?. It's been such a long time. But I've tried to live without. I'm suffocating. I need you to breathe. So reach down and pull me up. Pull me up. Before I am buried beneath
chasing your echo,[Verse 1]. I'm captured again. Nothing now. Obeying this love escaping. Tasting yesterdays obsession. I'm feeling guilty of misery. Your love of violence. [Chorus]. It's over now. I don't know how to keep you here. But I can't let go. Don't run away. Just stay with me. Don't leave me. Chasing your echo. [Verse 2]. Desire breaks. My shadow wakes. It follows ever and after. [Chorus]. It's over now. I don't know how to keep you here. But I can't let go. Don't run away. Just stay with me. Don't leave me. Chasing your echo. [Bridge]. Obsession. Obsession. It's over now.

coming apart,"[Verse 1]. The world was brighter at the beginning. When I lived inside a dream. Is it too late now for you to see me?. When I'm breaking at the seams. [Pre-Chorus]. You're the one thing I can't, I can't lose. You're my one thing. [Chorus]. Hold on. I'm coming apart. I'm gone. But not too far. Hold on. I'll be strong. And don't give up on me today. Don't give up on me today. I'm coming apart. Don't give up on me. I'm coming apart. Don't give up on me. [Verse 2]. I'm still clinging to the memory. Is it fooling, fooling me. My only blessing, what I'm forgetting. Wish I could take it all away"

Walk away if you can learn to love again. Lie to me, if you can leave. I’ll still be here when you see. You’re not alone, you don’t have to run again. And leave me in denial. All the pain you fed. It starts to grow inside. It lives again and you can’t let it die. so you believe you’ll never find. A reason to love again. Lie to me if you can feel. That this love was never real. Walk away if you can learn to love again. Lie to me, if you can leave. I’ll still be here when you see. You’re not alone, you don’t have to run again. And leave me in denial"
losing control,"[Verse 1]. Just another caricature. See how temptation leads. It sells me the lies. like a sheep in disguise. With every word it plants another seed. [Verse 2]. I feel a change in the atmosphere. I never thought I'd end up back here. Divided, alone, afraid. In a breath my chains reappear. [Chorus]. And I build it all up. just to watch it fall down. (Nothing left to save, I'm letting go). And I'm digging all up. What I've buried underground. I'm losing, I'm losing control. I'm losing control. I'm losing control. [Verse 3]. Just another thorn in my side. I try again and fail. I seal my fate, it's almost too late. I try to hold on. but it's slipping, slipping away. [Chorus]. And I build it all up. just to watch it fall down. (Nothing left to save, I'm letting go). And I'm digging all up. What I've buried underground. I'm losing, I'm losing control. I'm losing control. I'm losing control. [Bridge]. Hold on to me, don't let me fall. 'Cause I can't waste it all on nothing. Hold on to me, please don't let go. I'm losing everything. [Chorus]. And I build it all up. just to watch it crash down. (I'm losing everything!). And I'm digging all up. what I buried underground. I'm losing, I'm losing control. I'm losing control.

lost,"Can I be dreaming once again?. I'm reaching helpless I descend. You lead me deeper through this maze. I'm not afraid, I'm. (Chorus). Lost in you. Everywhere I run. Everywhere I turn. I'm finding something new. Lost in you. Something I can't fight. I could not escape. I could spend my life. Lost in you. Your whispers fill these empty halls. I'm searching for you as you call. I'm racing, chasing after you. I need you more I'm. (Chorus). I could never be the same. It's something that I. Never could erase. I could never look away. I've lost myself. In you. It's all over now. Lost in you. Everywhere I run. Lost in you. Everywhere I run. Lost in you. Lost in you"
love will leave a mark,"There's no use to try and suppress. It's always there reminding. The one wound that never forgets. Open and undying. Always alive, always inside. And no one comes out the same. Love always leaves a mark. The scars give it all away. Burned in your heart. Love will leave a mark. Twisting, tearing apart. Holding me together. Changing every thought. Haunting me forever. Always inside. And no one comes out the same. Love always leaves a mark. The scars give it all away. Love will leave a mark. With every tear in every sound. Consumed with fire that never burns out. Finding a way through the dark. Love will leave a mark. And no one comes out the same. Love always leaves a mark. The scars give it all away. Love will leave a mark. With every tear in every sound. Consumed with a fire that never burns out. Finding a way through the dark. Love will leave a mark.

nothing and everything,"Enemy, familiar friend. My beginning and my end. Broken truth, whispering lies. And it hurts again. What I fear and what I try. Words I say and what I hide. All the pain, I want it to end. But I want it again. And it finds me. The fight inside is coarsing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is breaking me again. It's still the same, pursuing pain. Isn't worth the lie I've gained. We both know how it will end. But I do it again. And it finds me. The fight inside is coarsing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is hurting me again. And it finds me. The war within me pulls me under. And without you. The fight inside is breaking me again. And it finds me. The war within me pulls me under.

of these chains,So here we are at the end now. I need to leave but I only wanna stay with you. I never asked to be the one to set me free. And now the mask you wore that only I could see. Let me take you when I go when I go. I don't wanna do this on my own on my own. I'm breaking free but of these chains. Oh let this one remain. Let me take you when I go. I can still feel you here now in this cage. Every link another piece of you I saved. Afraid to open up the door to who I was before. So if I let go off these chains now. Will I float away. Can I just hold on. Oh let me take you when I go when I go. I don't wanna do this on my own on my own. I'm breaking free but of these chains. Oh let this one remain. Let me take you when I go
ordinary world,"Came in from a rainy thursday. On the avenue. Thought I heard you talking softly. I turned on the lights, the tv. And the radio. Still I can't escape the ghost of you. What has happened to it all?. Crazy, some say. Where is the life that I recognize?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Passion or coincidence. Once prompted you to say. ""pride will tear us both apart"". Well now pride's gone out the window. Cross the rooftops. Run away. Left me in the vacuum of my heart. What is happening to me?. Crazy, some say. Where is my friend when I need you most?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. What has happened to it all?. Crazy, some say. Where is the world that I recognize?. Gone away. And I won't cry for yesterday. There's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way. To the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Everyone, everyone. Somehow I have to find"
out from under,"Knocked off my feet. The earth moved beneath. The edge of a dream and a nightmare. Open the door. Fell through the floor. Slipped through the cracks into nowhere. So tell me where were you. When everything fell down like thunder. I begged you to pull me through. I couldn’t get out from under. I took the fall. I took it all. Last night was just an illusion. Cut me, I bleed. Feel me in need. I finally broke in the pressure. So tell me where were you. When everything fell down like thunder. I begged you to pull me through. I couldn’t get out from under. Left me for dead inside my head. Couldn’t you see that I was still breathing?. Screaming, I reached for you. I couldn’t get out from under. Where were you?. I reached for you. The pressure broke me down. Where were you?. I reached for you. The pressure broke me. Where were you?. The pressure broke me. Where were you?. The pressure broke me. Where were you?.

overtake you,"Time, it's eating me alive,. Unable to rewind,. Sink deeper while I'm climbing,. Never to arrive,. I gave you everything,. But you still need to feed,. And underneath it all I'm screaming out. [chorus]. Just carry one, just prove me wrong. I know that I'm dying right now.. And it seems like that I'm so far gone. But not for long.. I'll just be strong and keep knowing. That now I will overtake you.. You must want what you can use,. Won't risk what you can lose,. Play the victim while keep abusing,. Anyone you choose,. A painful consequence,. Of standing on your lies,. I'm barely breathing but I'm screaming out. (Just carry on). I know that I'm dying right now,. And it seems that I'm so far gone. (Overtake you).

part that's holding on,"It all looks different now. But it was right in front of me. The memories fall around. Of everything I used to be. Can I let it go?. When I still feel your echoes. I watched you disappear. But I can't make myself believe. I gave it all. But you were fading. Where'd you go?. all alone I couldn't stay. Another fall, through the dark. Of the shadows. I reached for you, only you. There's still a part. A part that's holding on. Can we call it fair. Or was it just a dire game?. Who's the winner now?. When I can't even speak your name. Caught inside the dream. When you were reaching back for me. Did you get lost inside. Or did you disappear. I gave it all. But you were fading. Where'd you go?. all alone I couldn't stay. Another fall, through the dark. Of the shadows. I reached for you, only you. There's still a part. A part that's holding on. You went dark on me. Never tried to see. What it's like to be. The one who lost it all. Did you find your way. Is there still a place. Is there a part of you. That's holding on. Still holding on. I gave it all. But you were fading. Where'd you go? where'd you go?. I gave it all. But you were fading. Where'd you go?. all alone I couldn't stay. Another fall, through the dark. Of the shadows. I reached for you, only you.

We're a light that will never die. This is the moment we come alive. We're living in a desperate time. We're waking up. To dreaming of a better life. We won't give up. Our love is like a warning sign. Revealing of a life that's all brand new. If only we can see it through. So reach to the sky. The life we have has come. This night of our lives. We've only just begun. Together we are. Bright as the stars. We're a light that will never die. This is the moment we come alive. This is the moment we come alive. The energy within us. Ignites us forever, forever, forever. So reach to the sky. The life we have has come. This night of our lives. We've only just begun. Together we are. Bright as the stars. We're a light that will never die. This is the moment we come alive"

wasting time,"You found me here. Waiting for your chance. You would reach inside. And take of me. You want your lies. To smother me again. But now you can't. Don't even try. You're wasting time. Come back I'll beat you down. Turn around. I'm fighting my way through you. Push you away. I'll never break. Come back I'll beat you down. It's over now. I’m turning my back on you. I turn around. There you are. A blink and a flash. Back to you again. You pushed me down. Tried to steal it all. This time I'm pushing back. Go ahead, try and stop me. Go ahead, try and stop me. Go ahead, try and stop me. Go ahead and try"
watch you crawl,"You put my back against the wall. Watching, waiting. You never thought I'd get this far. Beneath your skin. I watched you swim with all your lies. They pulled you under. And as you wait for my demise. I'm just getting stronger. I'm learning who you really are. And nothing can save you. I will fight until the end. Get ready to collide. And I will watch you fall again. I'll bury you alive. You tried to bring me to my knees. You tried to take it all. Now I will stand and watch you crawl. I'll put you back where you belong. Hopeless, fading. And I will rise while you. Become the monster you have fed. Let you drown in your despair. Now nothing can save you. I will fight until the end. Get ready to collide. And I will watch you fall again. I'll bury you alive. You tried to bring me to my knees. You tried to take it all. Now I will stand and watch you crawl. Now I'm gonna watch you crawl!. I will fight until the end. Get ready to collide. And I will watch you fall again. I'll bury you alive. You tried to bring me to my knees. You tried to take it all. Now I will stand and watch you crawl"
what you keep alive,"You should be afraid of me. Pain is the promise I will keep. I am the whisper in the dark. I am the scream when you fall. And you will feel the pain, you'll see. And I will bring the pain you need. You keep me alive. (So I can hurt you). You need me inside. (I'm what you keep alive). You picked me up, you watched me shine. Like a razor in your hand. And when I cut beneath your skin. You want it all again. I am the call in the night. I am the truth behind your lie. And now you'll feel the pain, you'll see. You keep me alive. (So I can hurt you). You need me inside. (I'm what you keep alive). Turning, the knife is turning now. I can't pay this ransom. (My love, my enemy). Does any hope remain. (I'm swimming in your veins). My love, my enemy. (Now you can't escape). I can feel you in my veins. (The pain is on its way). And now it's too late. (Now I'm letting go). You should've run away. (I'll watch you suffocate). Now you can't escape. I am the dark and I am awake. (Suffocate). Waking, the nightmare bleeds, over. I'll fight you, your darkness, feeding. I keep you alive. (So I can hurt you). I lift the knife. (I'm what you keep alive). Now you can't escape. (Suffocate, suffocate). You will feel the pain. (Suffocate, suffocate)"
who we are,"We were the ones who weren't afraid. We were the broken-hearted. We were the scars that wouldn't fade away. How did we let go?. How did we forget, that we don't have to hide. We won't believe the lies again. We won't be paralyzed!. We can be who we are, now we are alive!. We can fight, they cannot contain us. It's who we are, we are undying!. We won't hide our faces from the light. Eliminated the space between us. It's who we are, we are forever!. It's who we are!. We were the tears that passion cried. We were the sacrificed. We were the flame that wouldn't die, inside. How did we go wrong?. We will not forget, we won't get left behind. We won't give up the fight again. We won't be denied!. We can be who we are, now we are alive!. We can fight, they cannot contain us. It's who we are. We are undying, we are forever!. We won't hide our faces from the light. Eliminated the space between us. It's who we are, we are forever!. It's who we are!. We will never die!. We will never die!. We will lose this life knowing we are alive!. We can be who we are, now we are alive!. We can fight, they cannot contain us. It's who we are. We are undying, we are forever!. We won't hide our faces from the light. Eliminated the space between us. It's who we are, we are forever!. It's who we are!"
yours again,"I can almost feel you breathing. Like a whisper in my ear. I remember how you lost me. Or how I lost you. I'm staring into the blackness. It's staring back at me. Why did I try to live without you?. I want you, I need you!. Open up my eyes, I need your light again. Burning me inside, I need you love again. I can feel our hearts collide. I can feel our hearts ignite. Open up my eyes, I'm yours again!. Will I wake up from this moment?. Will I see you slip away?. Or is this some new beginning. Of beauty and rage?. Where did I lose my passion?. Where did I start to fade?. Without you my world is darkness. I won't let go again!. Open up my eyes, I need your light again. Burning me inside, I need you love again. I can feel our hearts collide. I can feel our hearts ignite. Open up my eyes, I'm yours again!. I'm yours again!. I'm never letting go. I'm yours again!. Open up my eyes, I need your light again. Burning me inside, I need you love again. I can feel our hearts collide. I can feel our hearts ignite. Open up my eyes, I'm yours again!"
