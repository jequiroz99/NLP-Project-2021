truth,"Kill your hate. Gotta reborn. Feed your faith. No more pain, no more. Let your soul. Fly away. Let it flow. In your veins. Cause the truth is in our hearts. Forget your flesh. Got to save your soul. You will find the truth. Inside you!"
dosed,Dosed. I got dosed by you. Closer than most to you. What am I supposed to do?. Take it away I never had it anyway. Take it away and everthing will be. Okay. In you a star is borning. You cut a perfect forming. Someone forever warm. Lay on...lay on...lay on...lay on.... Lay on...lay on...lay on...lay on.... Chorus. Way upon the mountain where she died. All I ever wanted was your life. Deep inside the canyon I can't hide. All I ever wanted was your life. Show love with no remorse. Climb on to your sea horse. This ride is right on course. This is the way I wanted it to be with you. This is the way I Knew that it would be with you.. Lay on...lay on...lay on...lay on.... Chorus. Way upon the mountain where she died. All I ever wanted was your life. Deep inside the canyon I can't hide. All I ever wanted was your life.
