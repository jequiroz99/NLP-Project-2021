He courts the lightning flash and her. Summoning the spirits. Through incantations. You said the thunder god seems to have. And our enemies are the reed. But we knew the furies held the holly sacred.

The constant change of the night sun. A song in the blood of the white bull. Our language of love. The battle of trees. We fought side by side. No one had more. Sharper consonants than you, love. And my vowels, well, were trusted. From ivy leaves is an ale that can unveil. The hidden meanings and serpents. Only revealed through visions. Yes vowels could insert. ""a"" was for the silver fir. The firs of course. Then came next. With heather at her most. Passionate. The white poplar's gift to the souls of the dead. A promise that it was not the end. But for the vine the ""u"", its coffer. Vowels and consonants. The power of trees. The power they hold. The power of prose. So when the church. Began to twist the old myths. They built their own tower of babel. From ulster to munster. The reed gave way then. To the elder. The earth turns her will. So that night follows day. From dawn to dawn. Fom winter to winter. At day the ash had power over the alder. Our language of love. The battle of trees. We fought side by side. Then he said to me:. ""I've dodged bullets and even poisoned arrows. Only to be foiled by the blade of a vowel"""

You can laugh, It's kind of funny the things you think times like these. like I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this. Yes I wore a slinky red thing, does that mean I should spred. for you, your friends, your father, Mr. Ed. It was me and a gun and a man on my back. but I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this. And I know what this means, me and Jesus a few years back. Used to hang and he said ""It's your choice babe, just remember. I don't think that you'll be back in 3 days time so you choose well"". Tell me what's right, Is it my right to be on my stomach of Fred's Seville. It was me and a gun and a man on my back. But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this. And do you know Carolina where the biscuits are soft and sweet. These things go through you head when there's a man on your back. and you're pushed flat on your stomach, it's not a classic cadillac. Me and a gun and a man on my back. But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this. I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this."

weatherman,He is not a weatherman. But his bride lies with the land. And she will whisper to him. I'll be dressing up in snow. Cloaked in echo it's almost. As if only Nature knows. How to bring his wife to life. And breathe her into form. One more look from her eyes. One more look. Can you paint her back to life?. He knows every moor and mound. Every curve of every hill. A shoulder of the mountain. Where they watched a thousand dawns. One more look from her eyes. One more look. Can you paint her back to life?. Rising she stirs. First it blurs. A breeze that lifts. Lilac blossoms from the Earth. Blending it's shape. Wo a skirt. Lith limbs that bend. He's drawn toward her pirouette turn. Autumn's peach black. Winter's velvet coat. Pink Tourmaline. Palette of Spring. In Summer she's wrapped in. Viennese green. He is not a weatherman. But his bride lies with the land. And she will whisper to him. I'll be dressing up in snow. Cloaked in echo it's almost. As if only Nature knows. How to paint his wife to life. With every season's tone. One more look from her eyes. One more look from her eyes. One more look from her eyes. One more look from her eyes. One more look from her eyes. One more look. Can you paint her back to life?
wedding day,"The deafening sound of silence. Silence the siren between us. Now I drink back the past. Back to our wedding day. We'd hang onto every. Word the other would say. Blanket on Bluebell Knoll. Under a starry night holding us close. As Jupiter winked at the Earth. On that our wedding day. I run back to your arms again. Back there, safe in your arms again. Your thoughts safely were shared. My secrets to you I gave. I swore angels were born. You said heaven can be made. Above us on Bluebell Knoll. The laughing seven maids chased by the bull. As Virgo she danced through the dawn. On that our wedding day. I run back to your arms again. Back there, safe in your arms again. The deafening sound of silence. Silence the siren between us. I run back to your arms again. Back, there safe in your arms again. I run back to your arms again. Now I take off the mask. That hides all this from your gaze. As you sleep I pretend you dream. Of our wedding day"
wednesday,"Nothing here to fear. I'm just sitting around. being foolish when. there is work to be done. Just a hang-up call. and the quiet breathing. of our Persian we call. Cajun on a Wednesday. so we go from year to year. with secrets we've been keeping. Though you say you're not a Templar man. Seems as if we're circling. for very different reasons. But one day the Eagle has to land. Out past the fountain. a left by the station. I start the day in the usual way. Then think -- well why not --. and stop for a coffee. then begin to recall. things that you say. No one's at the door. You suggest a ghost. perhaps a phantom. I agree with this in part.

I start the day in the usual way. Then think -- well why not --. and stop for a coffee. then begin to recall. things that you say. Pluck up the courage. and snap. It's gone again. I start humming ""When Doves Cry"". Can someone help me. I think that I'm Lost here. Lost in a place called America. ."

wildwood,"Wildwood, poppies. Wildwood, touch me. Behind the birches whirl. The bongo boys in their summoning. The sound seeds now. In the fingers of the eastern breeze. Where the sleepless wait. For her ascent from the perilous pit. She said, the only way to change our fate. It is to make it rain. Wildwood, poppies. Wildwood, touch me. Past the Alders and the Oaks. Through the Willow Grove snakes the Ivy's gift. Which taught you can't escape anguish. But how to live with it. Then reports from the robins. Form in you an inner radiance. It's as if they fused with a spirit you knew. Who's come back again. Wildwood, poppies. Wildwood, touch me. Off the pilgrim's path. With the talisman he placed in my hands. With its magic mapped from winter's past. It leads the way. After three long months. Endured with her absent. Over dragon lines we walked. The current, a labyrinth. With little green corn shoots. Now in abundance. As the forest celebrates. She says, make it rain. Wildwood, poppies. Wildwood, touch me. Touch me again"

winter,"Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens. Wipe my nose, get my new boots on. I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter. I put my hand in my father's glove. I run off where the drifts get deeper. Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown. I hear a voice ""You must learn to stand up for yourself. cause I can't always be around"". He says when you gonna make up your mind. When you gonna love you as much as I do. When you gonna make up your mind. Cause things are gonna change so fast. All the white horses are still in bed. I tell you that I'll always want you near. You say that things change my dear. Boys get discovered as winter melts. Flowers competing for the sun. Years go by and I'm here still waiting. Withering where some snowman was. Mirror mirror where's the crystal palace. but I only can see myself. Skating around the truth who I am. but I know, dad, the ice is getting thin. When you gonna make up your mind. When you gonna love you as much as I do. When you gonna make up your mind. Cause things are gonna change so fast. All the white horses are still in bed. I tell you that I'll always want you near. You say that things change my dear. Hair is grey and the fires are burning. So many dreams on the shelf. You say I wanted you to be proud. I always wanted that myself. When you gonna make up your mind. When you gonna love you as much as I do. When you gonna make up your mind. Cause things are gonna change so fast. All the white horses have gone ahead. I tell you that I'll always want you near. You say that things change my dear. Never change. All the white horses."
