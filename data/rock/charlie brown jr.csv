So far away, so i'm missing you. That's always you. You're so far away. Behind the wall so many dreams fall down. It's all right. I'm gonna live my life. You said to me you're out. You've just cried enough. It's all right. I'm gonna live my life. I don't wanna let you go. So far away, so i'm missing you. That's always you. You're so far away"
