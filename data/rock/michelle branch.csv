here with me,"It's been a long long time since I looked into the mirror. I guess that I was blind, now my reflection's getting clearer. Now that you're gone things will never be the same, again. There's not a minute that goes by, every hour of every day. You're such a part of me but I just pulled away. Well I'm not the same girl you used to know. I wish I said the words I never showed. I know you had to go away. I died just a little. And I feel it now, you're the one I need. I believe that I. Would cry just a little. Just to have you back now, here with me. You know that silence is loud when all you hear is your heart. And I wanted so badly just to be a part. Of something strong and true but I was scared and left it all behind. I know you had to go away. I died just a little. And I feel it now, you're the one I need. I believe that I. Would cry just a little. Just to have you back now, here with me. And I'm asking. And I'm wanting you to come back to me please. I never will forget the look upon your face. How you turned away and left without a trace. But I understand that you did what you had to do. And I thank you. I know you had to go away. I died just a little. And I feel it now, you're the one I need. I believe that I. Would cry just a little. Just to have you back now, here with me."
summertime,It's the time of year when things are growing wild. When love is found underneath the stars. The kids are playing in the backyard now. Catching fireflies in a jar. And I am sitting on my back porch. And I'm wondering where you are. And if you look at the moon like I do. And does it break your heart?. Does it break your heart. When you think about me?. Do you remember to forget?. Summertime. I go back there in my mind. Kissing underneath the moonlight. Discovering things we thought we'd never find. When I was yours and baby you were mine. Summertime. I thought I saw you a couple months ago. At the airport boarding a plane. I couldn't move. I didn't know what to do. And it took my breath away. I heard she's wearing a shiny diamond ring. I guess you're finally moving on. I hope you're happy when she looks up at you. And I know it might be wrong. Yeah it might be wrong. But when I think about you. I still can't forget. Summertime. I go back there in my mind. Kissing underneath the moonlight. Discovering things we though we'd never find. When I was yours and baby you were mine. Summertime. I go back there in my mind. Oooh how it gets me every time. All the flowers growing wild. Kissing underneath the moonlight. Discovering things we thought we'd never find. When I was yours and baby you were mnine. Summertime. I am sitting on my back porch. And I'm wondering where you are
ready to let you go,"Well, you walked in and knocked me right out of my seat. How could a pretty little boy make such a fool out of me. Oh, you better run for cover, you better get on your knees.

Well you won't find me cryin' in my drink. I got a little black dress and my toes are painted pink. Oh, my brother said to tell you you're tires look kind of low. My daddy says he knows of a lake where no one goes. Im ready to let you go. I'm reaching for something that I can't hold. I'm tired of feeling low. I'm getting ready ... to let you go. Maybe someday the truth will set you free. Til that day keep you're lying hands off me. Oh, I'm ready to let you go. I'm reaching for something that I can't hold. I'm tired of feeling low.

drop in the ocean,Love took me by the hand. Love took me by surprise. Love led me to you. And love opened up my eyes. And I was drifting away. Like a drop in the ocean. And now I realize that. Nothing has been as beautiful. As when I saw Heaven's skies. In your eyes. In your eyes. And everytime I drift away. I lose myself in you. And now I see that I can be me. In everything I do. 'Cause I was feeling as small. As a drop in the ocean. And now I realize that. Nothing has been as beautiful. As when I saw Heaven's skies. In your eyes. In your eyes. Love took me by the hand.

texas in the mirror,"I remember driving in our car. Forty miles outside of. Where we're going but I don't know where we are. Miles away from nothing. Funny how things can change so fast.

Growing up is really make believe. They never told us 1983, these 16mm memories. And got us falling in slow motion. They make me feel like I had too much to drink. The room is spinning and I trip on my feet. I'm seeing doubles seeing things I don't mean. Just had taste and already wasted. And if I need it will you carry me home.

The darkest alley is a heartbeat. Is a heartbeat. You remind me. And I swear that I am walking. Through a daydream. Hear your heartbeat. That's where you're gonna find me. Every shape and transatlantic color wrap around me. I've discovered that I just want to get. As far as I can run to from the sun in california. I don't know how the west is ever gonna win me. Once I'm breathing in the water. I'm gonna drown out every sentimental memory. Find the courage to start over. Oh I know there's got to be a reason. 'cause I'm always running from my life. They say. ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"". But I don't know what it is about this city. Miles away someone I know is sleeping. In a bedroom by the window. I guess I've always been afraid. That I would miss out. And get blown out like a candle. And I don't know what it is about this city. Every road I walk down I discover. Little pieces I thought I never had in me. I never had in me.

hotel paper,". I write mostly on hotel paper. Knowing that my thoughts will never leave this room. I’d be out of line telling you, “leave her”. So I lie lonely surrounded by you. By you. Lately I can’t be happy for no one. They think I need some time to myself. I try to smile but I can’t remember. And I know tomorrow there’ll be nothing else. And I wanted to be. Giving you everything that she’s not giving. And I wanted to see. ‘Cause I didn’t believe what I’d be hearing. You turned out to be more than I bargained for. And I can tell that you need to get away. Forgive me if I admit that I’d love to love you. We both realized it way too late. And I wanted to be. Giving you everything that she’s not giving. And I wanted to see. ‘Cause I didn’t believe what I’d be hearing. Maybe this wind blowing in just came from the ocean. I write mostly on hotel paper."

where are you now?,. Maybe it’d be better on my own. No one ever seems to understand me. It’s easier for me to be alone. But there’s still a piece of me that feels so empty. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen a million different places. But through the crowds and all the faces. I’m still out there looking for you. Where are you now?. I’m trying to get by with never knowing at all. What is the chance of finding you out there?. Or do I have to wait forever?. I write about the things I’ll never know. And I can’t find a moment just to slow down. It makes me think I’ll never have the chance. To figure out what it’s all about. So tell me what it’s all about. Where are you now?. I’m trying to get by with never knowing at all. What is the chance of finding you out there?. Or do I have to wait forever?. Where are you now?. I’m trying to get by with never ever knowing at all. And I still don’t know. Where are you now?. I’m trying to get by with never ever knowing at all. What is the chance of finding you out there?. Or do I have to wait. Or do I have to wait. Or do I have to wait forever?.

I keep on tryin, slowly dyin,. thinkin about I need you here with me.. MB: I wear your shirt, the scent of you,. reminds me of the night, when we became two. There's nothing else that feels the same,. Everyday there's sun it feels just like rain.. J: Just know that I'm with you,. And what you feel, I feel it too, yeah.. [Chorus]. MB: If you think it's easy for me,. Well, you're wrong.. Sometimes I'm weak and baby you know. I'm not that strong.. J: You're in New York and I'm in LA,. there's so much to tell you,. words I need to say.. But your phone keeps ringin(ringin, ringin). [Chorus]. I'm feeling lately, I'm goin crazy. (I need you here with me). Wonderin how I'll go on without you. (How will I go on without you?). J: It's been 2 weeks and 3 days long,. I'm all alone since you've been gone.."
you get me,"So I'm a little left of center. I'm a little out of tune. Some say I'm paranormal. So I just bend their spoon. Who wants to be ordinary. In a crazy, mixed up world. I dont care what they're sayin'. As long as I'm your girl. Hey, you are on my side. And they, they just roll their eyes. You get me. When nobody understands. You come and take the chance, baby. You get me. You look inside my wild mind. Never knowing what you'll find. And still you want me all the time. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you get me. So what if I see the sunshine. In the pouring rain. Some people think I'm crazy. But you say it's okay. You've seen my secret garden. Where all of my flowers grow. In my imagination. Anything goes. I, I am all you want. They, they just read me wrong. You get me. When nobody understands. You come and hold my hand, baby. You get me. You look inside my wild mind. Never knowing what you'll find. Still you want me all the time. Yeah, you do. 'cause you get me. Hey, you are on my side. They, they just roll their eyes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 'Cause you get me. When nobody understands. You come and take the chance, baby. You get me. When none of the pieces fit. You make sense of it. You get me. You look inside my wild mind. Never knowing what you'll find. And still I want you all the time. Yeah I do. 'Cause you get me. Yeah, oh, yeah, oh."
you get what you give,"gonna blow it, gonna blow it, gonna blow it, gonna blow it,. gonna one, two, one, two, three ow!. Wake up kids. We've got the dreamers disease. Age 14 we got you down on your knees. So polite, we're busy still saying please. Friend-emies, who when you're down ain't your friend. Every night we smash their Mercedes-Benz. First we run and then we laugh till we cry. But when the night is falling. and you cannot find the light. If you feel your dream is dying. Hold tight. Chorus:. You've got the music in you. Don't let go. You've got the music in you. One dance left. This world is gonna pull through. Don't give up. You've got a reason to live. Can't forget we only get what we give. give it to me now.... Four a.m. we ran a miracle mile. we're flat broke but fuck we do it in style. The bad rich. God's flying in for your trial. But when the night is falling. and you cannot find a friend. If you feel your tree is breakin'. Just then. Chorus:. You've got the music in you. Don't let go. You've got the music in you. One dance left. This world is gonna pull through. Don't give up. You've got a reason to live. Can't forget we only get what we give. This whole damn world can fall apart. You'll be ok follow your heart. You're in harms way. I'm right behind. Now say youre mine. Chorus:. You've got the music in you. Don't let go. You've got the music in you. One dance left. This world is gonna pull through. Don't give up. You've got a reason to live. Can't forget we only get what we give. (don't let go). I feel the music in you... oh oh. Fly high. What's real can't die. You're gonna get what you give. You're gonna get what you give. Just don't be affraid to be. Health insurance rip off lying FDA big bankers buying. Fake computer crashes dining. Cloning while they're multiplying. Fashion shoots. with Beck and Hanson. Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson. You're all fakes. Run to your mansions. Come around. We'll kick your ass in!. who who who who who who who. who who who who who who who. who who who who who who who who who who. who who who who who who who. who who who who who who who. who who who who who who who. who who who who who who who. who who who who who who who."
you hold my heart,"Do you believe in love at first sight. I know it is true now cuz it happened that night. But now you, slip away. Don't believe me, when I say. When you hold my hand you hold my heart. But lately we still drift apart. When I say I love you I mean it. When I say I love you I mean it. I mean it. Do you believe that we're meant to be. I know it's true now but you just don't see. Cuz now, you get scared. Don't believe me, but it's there. When you hold my hand you hold my heart. But lately we still drift apart. When I say I love you I mean it. When I say I love you I mean it. I mean it. Please believe me when I say. I'll love you till the end. forever and a day. When you hold my hand you hold my heart. But lately we still drift apart. When I say I love you I mean it. When I say I love you I mean it. I mean it. I mean it"
you set me free,Can't you see?. There's a feeling that's come over me. Close my eyes. You're the only one that leaves me. Completly breathless. No need to wonder why. Sometimes a gift like this you can't deny. Cause I wanted to fly. So you give me your wings. And time held its breath so I could see. Yeah. And you set me free. There's a will. There's a way. Sometimes words just can't explain. This is real. I'm afraid. I guess this time there' s just no hiding. Fighting. You make me restless. You're in my heart. The only light that shines. There in the dark. Cause I wanted to fly. So you give me your wings. And time held its breath so I could see. Yeah. And you set me free. When I was alone. You came around. When I was down. You pulled me through. And there's nothing that. I wouldn't do for you. Cause I wanted to fly. So you give me your wings. And time held its breath so I could see. Yeah. And you set me free
you're good,"Nobody know me better. You got a way, yeah you know you do. Say it'll be forever. And I'm gonna believe 'cause I know it's true. Everybody tells me that you're not in love. They don't understand you like I do. Will never change their minds. Because they're not in love. Not in love. Never no they're not in love with you. I know the way you feel in the dark. Move in the dark, so, so. You're like a song, I know you by heart. Every part of your soul. And I know you're good. Everybody tells me that you're not enough. They don't understand you. Will never change their minds. Because they're not in love. Not in love. Never no they're not in love with you. I know the way you feel in the dark. Move in the dark, so, so. You're like a song, I know you by heart. Every part of your soul. And I know you're good. I know the way you feel in the dark. Move in the dark, so, so. You're like a song, I know you by heart. Every part of your soul. I know the way you feel in the dark. Move in the dark, so, so. You're like a song, I know you by heart. Every part of your soul. And I know you're good"
