through glass,"I'm looking at you through the glass. Don't know how much time has passed. Oh God, it feels like forever. But no one ever tells you that forever. Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head. How do you feel? That is the question. But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer. When something like a soul becomes. Initialized and folded up like paper dolls and little notes. You can't expect a bit of hopes. So while you're outside looking in. Describing what you see. Remember what you're staring at is me. Cause I'm looking at you through the glass. Don't know how much time has passed. All I know is that it feels like forever. No one ever tells you that forever. Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head. How much is real? So much to question. An epidemic of the mannequins. Contaminating everything. When thought came from the heart. It never did right from the start. Just listen to the noises. (Null and void instead of voices). Before you tell yourself it's just a different scene. Remember it's just different from what you've seen. I'm looking at you through the glass. Don't know how much time has passed. And all I know is that it feels like forever. No one ever tells you that forever. Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head. Cause I'm looking at you through the glass. Don't know how much time has passed. All I know is that it feels like forever. No one ever tells you that forever. Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head. And it's the stars, the stars. That shine for you. And it's the stars, the stars. That lie to you, yeah. I'm looking at you through the glass. Don't know how much time has passed. Oh God, it feels like forever. But no one ever tells you that forever. Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head. Cause I'm looking at you through the glass. Don't know how much time has passed. All I know is that it feels like forever. But no one ever tells you that forever. Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head. And it's the stars, the stars. That shine for you, yeah. And it's the stars, the stars. That lie to you, yeah. And it's the stars, the stars. That shine for you, yeah. And it's the stars, the stars. That lie to you, yeah. Oh, and the stars. Oh, and the stars they lie"
wicked game,"The world was on fire. No one could save me but you.. Strange what desire will make foolish people do. I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you. And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you. No, I don't wanna fall in love. No, I don't wanna fall in love. With you (2x). What a wicked game to play. To make me feel this way.

zzyxz rd.,"I don't know how else to put this. It's taking me so long to do this. I'm falling asleep and I can't see straight. My muscles feel like I may lay. Body is curled in an U shape. I put up my best, but I'm still afraid. Propped up by lies and promises. Saving my place as life forgets. Maybe it's time I saw the world. I'm only here for a while. Patience it's not my style. And I'm so tired that I gotta go. What am I supposed to want now. What am I supposed to do?. Did you really think I wouldn't see this through?. Tell me I should stick around for you. Tell me I could have it all. And still I'm too tired to care and I gotta go. I get to go home in one week. But I'm leaving home in three weeks. They throw me a bone just to pick me dry. I'm following soothing directions. I crawled up inside for protection. I'm told what to do and I don't know why. I'm over-existing in limbo. I'm over the myths and placebos. I don't really mind if I just fade away. I'm ready to live with my family. I'm ready to die in obscurity. 'cause I'm so tired that I gotta go. What am I supposed to want now?. What am I supposed to do?. Still don't think I wouldn't see this through?. Tell me I am part of history. Tell me I can have it all. And still I'm too tired to care and I gotta go. Oh yeah. oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.. Still to tired to care and I gotta go. Still to tired to care and I gotta go. Still to tired to care and I gotta go. Yea yea. Still to tired to care and I gotta go.

tired,"I'm alive in here. So alive in here. Pulling down a little peace. I'm open wide in here. Slow to rise in here. Saving grace and killing me. You say this only makes me incomplete. I'm cancelled out and rendered obsolete. Tell the mad Chameleon he's not welcome anymore. I know what I'm looking for. Somewhere close!. Somewhere safe!. Somewhere I know, I know, I'll never live in chains. The one, is now aware, so stay away from me. I'm just too young to care!. I can see in here. I can feel in here. Comatose with common sense. I take my time in here. Somebody get me out of here. What am I so against?. I just want to watch the whole world burn. Lost a million times and I won't learn. Show me someone innocent. I'll show you there's no proof. I may be gone but I'm no fool. I'm not close. I'm not safe. I don't know, don't know, am I better off in chains?. The one, is not aware, so stay away from me. I'm just too young to care. I need somewhere close!. Somewhere safe. Somewhere I know, I know, I'll never live in chains. The one, is now aware, so stay away from me. I'm just too young to care"
song #3,"If you take a step towards me. You will take my breath away. So I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe. No one else has ever loved me. No one else has ever tried. I never understood how much I could take. Then I saw the worst was over. When I laid my eyes on you. It was all that I could do to know my place. Out of all the vast illusions. Out of all the dreams come true. I was gone until I finally saw your face. If you cried out for more. If you reached out for me. I would run into the storm. Just to keep you here with me. I have gone beyond my years. I've wasted half my life. But I found it all in you. Did I save you?. 'Cause I know you saved me too. Let me take a step towards you. Let me feel you in my hands. Let me cross this line and show you where it leads. There's a darkness down inside me. That I know we'll both enjoy. And its screaming from within to set it free. I have left this bloody nightmare. In my wake, but out of sight. All I want is deviation by design. Out of all the past confusion. Out of all the common spite. Just tell me I am yours cause you are mine. And if you cried out for more. If you reached out for me. I would run into the storm. Just to keep you here with me. I have gone beyond my years. I've wasted half my life. But I found it all in you. Did I save you?. 'Cause I know you saved me too. It doesn't really matter what you do or say. I'm never going anywhere anyway. Cause when I'm dying for you. I've never felt so alive. . If you cried out for more.

absolute zero,"The bloody angle, the symmetry. Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me. My mouth is a gun I can shoot. I can show you the truth. And I don't need a reason to lie to you. No pun intended. No punishment. If I offended you, you needed it. Ideas are the bombs in your mind. A fissure in time. If you don't have a weapon. You can't have mine. I can bleed if I want to bleed.

I'm giving into grievances again. You're looking at an absolute zero. I'm not the Devil, but I won't be your hero!. One thing that I can't stand. Is when the minutes fight the second hand. I'll waste a lifetime's worth. Just to cling to one more day. No fucking corner, no premiums. The world is stuck in delirium. Man is a four letter word. It's really absurd. The hate isn't fake, it's just inferred. Oh, I'm not afraid!. I'm giving into grievances again. I'm down to absolute zero. Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world!. Oh, I'm not afraid. And I will let you down as I hold you in. You're looking at an absolute zero. I'm not the devil but I won't be your hero"

rose red violent blue (this song is dumb & so am i),"Excuse me, oh pardon me. I'm still sticky on the inside. There comes a time where all I do. Is sit around in contemplation. And curse my situation. I'm just too bored for normal views. Be careful of what you wish for. Impossible to just ignore. One last time is all I need. To get my life and stocks in order. They're on the rise this quarter. Beware of certain friends. Who sell you out when everything is free. I know what I am to all of you. And I've got all these other things to do. To do. Open up and know enough I'm overused. Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused. Go ahead and tell the dead it's only you. But I am much too old. I am much too old. I am much too old now. Imagine this chaos theory. Makes all the profits leery. Somebody's showing them the ropes. We used to hang ourselves with. Instead of quiet respite. We choose the noose in lieu of hope. Oh rose red, oh violent blue. I should've seen the clues but. This song is dumb and so am I. Character assassinations. Are really observations. Stay home and ask yourself. Why am I so low when I'm so high. So high. Open up and know enough I'm overused. Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused. Go ahead and tell the dead it's only you. But I am much too old.

sadist,Withering eyes catch you as you fall. A bitter sigh. No one knows at all. Let me in. For one more long disgrace. Just forget. The same distractions you refuse to face. We both know that it's gone. But what if no one knows. No one knows to remember why it's wrong?. This is all the pain a man can take. This is how a broken heart still breaks. I don't need much to show you. Only enough to control you. Bury your head inside this. And gather the darkness that finds it. I think I'll die if you deny me. Swallowed alive in eternity. Give me a way to be the agony. That knew you all along. Push it down and hide me from this waste. Don't hold back. I'd kill to take your place. Tell me a lie. Tell me you don't care. Just forget. A storm is coming. Just forget your skin. We both know how this ends. But what if no one knows. No one knows how to kill us in the end?. This is all you need for who you are. This is how a good man goes too far. I don't need much to show you. Only enough to control you. Bury your head inside this. And gather the darkness that finds it. I think I'll die if you deny me. Swallowed alive in eternity. Give me a way to be the agony. That knew you all along. This is all the pain a man can take!. This is how the blackest circle breaks. I don't need much to show you. Only enough to control you. Bury your head inside this. And gather the darkness that finds it. I think I'll die if you deny me. Swallowed alive in eternity. Give me a way to be the agony. That knew you all along. I knew you all along!. I knew you all along!

omega,"What a skeletal wreck of man this is. Translucent flesh and feeble bones. The kind of temple where the whores and villians. Try to tempt the holistic tomes. Running rampant with free thought to free form. In the free and clear. Where the matters at hand are shelled out like lint at a laundromat. To sift and focus on the bigger, better, now. We all have a little sin than needs venting. Virtues for the rending. And laws and systems. And stems ariff from the branches of office. Do you know what your post entails?. Do you serve a purpose?. Or purposely serve?. Lying down inside of your adavistic galore. The value of a Summer spent. And a Winter earned. For the rest of us there is always Sunday.. The day of the week that reeks of rest. But all we do is catch out breaths. So we can wade naked into the bloody pool. And place our hand on the big black book.. To watch the knives zig-zag between our aching fingers.. A vacation is a count-down. T-minus your life and counting. Time to drag your tongue across the sugar-cube. And hope you get a taste. What the FUCK is all this for?! (What the hell is goin' on?!). SHUT UP!!. I could go on and on, but, lets move on shall we?. Say, you're me and I'm you. And they all watch the things we do. And like a smack of spite. They threw me down the stairs. Haven't felt like this in years. The great magnet of malicious magnanamous refuse. Let me go and. Punch me into the dead spot again.. Thats where you go when theres' no one else around. It's just you. And there was never anyone to begin with now was there?. Sanctomonious pretentious dasterdly bastards. With their thumb on the pulse. And a finger on the trigger. CLASSIFIED MY ASS! that's a FUCKING secret and you know it!. Government is another way to say. Better. Than. You.. It's like ice but no pick. A murder charge that won't stick. It's like a whole other world. Where you can smell the food. But you can't touch the silverware. Hah, what luck. Fascism you can vote for. Isn't that sweet. And we're all gonna die some day. Because thats the American way. And I've drunk too much. And said too little. When your gaffer taped in the middle. Say a prayer, save face. Get yourself together and (see whats happening). SHUT UP! (FUCK YOU!). FUCK YOU!. I'm sorry, I could go on and on but. It's time to move on, so. Remember your a wreck, an accident. Forget the freak, your just nature. Keep the gun oiled and the temple clean. Shit, snort and blaspheme. Let the heads cool and the engine run. Because in the end,. Everything we do. Is just everything we've done."

No daylight in the bunker - just darkness in the vaults. Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?. Digital - did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?.

do me a favor,I am an anti everything man. A scab on the lips of the lord. My caustic dismissal. Is all I need to get you. To fall on your sword. It's easy to live fast. It's harder to live.

freeze dry seal,My face is horrid and I'm constantly slouching. My place is lower so I'm constantly crouching. I don't believe it – I saw the man again. And he won't hear another word I say. I have delusions so I'm constantly shouting. I have compulsions so I'm constantly counting. I don't believe it – there goes my world again. And I don't understand a word I say. Just because I'm paranoid it doesn't mean I'm not annoyed and. Just because I'm not prepared doesn't mean I'm not aware. The smoke is infinite - I'm constantly panting. The truth is imminent - I'm constantly ranting. I don't believe it – I took a chance again and. People I don't know won't let it go. I've got some problems so I'm constantly bitching. I've got some rashes so I'm constantly itching. I don't believe it – forgot the pills again. I just woke up a million miles from home. Just because I seem sedate it doesn't mean I'm not irate and. Just because I'm not immune it doesn't mean I'm scared of you. Just because I'm incomplete it doesn't mean I'm obsolete and. Just because I'm out of view it doesn't mean I'm not like you
friday knights,"These visions in your vapor make you more and less. Keeping chaos is a chore today. But that murder in your sorrow bellows smoke and death.

funky milk,I've got a secret. But she's got a lot of secrets. I've got my pride. And she's got. It's kinda cruel. This fear of incantation. Well love's a game. And she's winning. No control. No beliefs. Wear me on your sleeve. She's no fool. And I'm no brain. You can't tell me. Buy or sell me. Or play me for the fool. I've seen it all. I've seen it all. We're all alone now. But I'm feeling so alone. She's talking politics. And I'm speechless. I'm just a statue. That she likes her friends to look at. No immortality. Just grief. Well love's a two way road. You gotta give it to receive. If I didn't care for you. I'd have half a mind to leave. Another pair of bloodstained eyes. Another broken life. Play your little song and dance. Upon the killer's life. I used to feel such joy. Just to hold your hand. But now I feel like crying. 'Cause I'm not a man. I'm not a man

gone sovereign,No one's laughing now. No one's laughing now. I'm sullen and sated. And you can't put a price on me. I won't share this disarray. I won't pull these hands away. I need to be chosen. And my god don't pray for me. So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead. And shatter every legend in my head. If only the commited will survive. Is anybody here still left alive?. This is mine!. Liar!. Come no further. You'll go to far. I'm running around in circles once again. If you can't forgive me. I won't take it very hard. But I won't make it easy in the end. So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead. And shatter every legend in my head. If only the contented will survive. Is anybody here still left alive?. This is mine!. This is mine!. Yeah!. So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead. And shatter every legend in my head. If only the commited will survive. Is anybody here still left alive?. This is mine!. Mine!. Mine!. Mine!. .

gravesend,"Holding the ""code"" on top. Waiting for light and sound to stop. Deeper and deeper, today. Further and further, I fade away. Let me ignore the cost. Special effects for common loss. I'm ready for numb. I'm ready for numb. If the demons take me. I just wanna be dead for good!. When the spirit meets me. I will die like a good man should!. I was only eighteen when I finally let go. Picking at the dead like a remnant on the road. I will never understand if I never get told. Living in the dark like a remnant on the road. Digging with pale, white hands. Keeping the calm and tasting sand. Doing a favor, today. Telling a friend to stay away. I can't afford the cost. I don't care for what I've lost. I'm ready for numb. I'm ready for numb. And if the angels take me. They're gonna need extra time. When the spirit mocks me. I'll know I'll only take what's mine. I was only twenty-five when I finally went home. Looking for a ride like a murder on the road. I will only understand when you leave me alone. Dying in the dark like a murder on the road. Like a murder on the road. You're never too young to remember you're old. Looking for a deal like the devil on the road. I will only understand when I finally get told. Waiting for the dark like the devil on the road. Like the devil on the road. Like the devil on the road. Like the devil on the road"

My Hell is running cold.... This hate is not gone -. You make me want to start a war. Because you waited so long -. You don't know what you're fighting for. I know this hate is not gone -. You have no right to be here. I wanna smoke, so I'll smoke - a calm before the storm. And I'll break, cuz I'm broke - still pissed... still fucking bored. And I hope - oh, I hope - you will finally go away. I know - God, I know - your change of faith is all for show. Your lack of self-control is all you know. It's over now, but you can't let it go. You can't begin to know the lives you hold. My Hell is running cold.... This hate is not gone -. You make me want to start a war. Because you waited so long -.

Making a curve or taking the strain. On the decline, or ut on the wain. Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later. We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend. Back on your feet to take the next bend!. You weather every storm that's coming atcha!. And I'm heading out to the highway. I got nothin' to lose at all. I'm gonna do it my way.

I never agreed to see this to the end. I can't go on again,. and if I'm wrong, then I know that I'm home again. Too much to lose, I'm choosing to learn, I'm learning to choose. We find our faith according to lies, according to clues. Remember, I remember, we were gonna burn the world together. But I can't stay, and I can't get away. Can anybody hear me?. Can anybody live like this?. Can anybody hear me?. Can anybody love someone. when they know that they don't exist?. I can't be wrong again,. I never agreed to see this to the end. I can't go on again,. and if I'm wrong, then I know that I'm home again. I can't be wrong again,. I never agreed to see this to the end. I can't go on again,. and if I'm wrong, then I know that I'm home again. Then I know that I'm home again. Then I know that I'm home again. By Rafael Monteiro"
hydrograd,"Don't come over, I don't want your company. I think you ought to spend a little bit of time alone. You say you don't need it. but damn I know you gotta have it. I tell you why. Ooh, I gotta love it on the inside. This hell is nothing new. If there's a hell then on the other side. You better pray you I don't get through. I'm not better than you, I'm just better. I'm not my own damn life. What do you think you know and what do you wanna know. I never thought I'd let the truth tell all my lies. My lies yeah. Ooh, I gotta love it on the inside. This hell is nothing new. If there's a hell then on the other side. You better pray you I don't get through. Bleeding for the savages. You bill me for the damages. When you're dealing with the devil. You know you gotta watch your back. Stack, you're thick, you're slick. They pull you in together and brace til you face. You can trust [?] to turn it away. And then they throw it all away. Ooh, I gotta [?] on the inside. This hell is nothing new. If there's a hell then on the other side. You better pray you I don't get through. [Chorus]. Ooh, I gotta [?] on the inside.

i can't believe,Chastity. What a virtue to be stolen. Tragedy. Has forsaken into fake. Blasphemy. Shadow stripped me of my reason. Misery. Comes to bed with me tonight. What am I gonna do. And now I can't believe. You let this happen to me. And I can't believe. They put those daggers through me. And I can't believe. You didn't come to save me from my pain. Laughed at me. They hit my face and clutched my rosary. Humility. A lesson best just left alone. Heresy. Because I'm two inside my body. Irony. A child of love from a man I hate. Until my dying day. And now I can't believe. You let this happen to me. And I can't believe. They put those daggers through me. And I can't believe. You didn't come to save me from my pain. And now I can't believe. You let this happen to me. And I can't believe. They put those daggers through me. And I can't believe. You didn't come to save me from my pain. . (enviado por Henrique da Silva Cardoso)
idle hands,"Stuck to the dog, pissin' out both ends. I got a hundred lethal weapons that I call my friends. Ain't a person on Earth who could take my life. I wish they would so a man could get some sleep at night. But my design is a mixture of descent and decay. I see a monster in the mirror fucking everyday. Can a man ever wash his hands of blood?. Perpetual deja vu, isn't that enough?. Peel back the layers… and see what I've become. Satisfied? Now I feel nothing. Stay away - I swear it wasn't me!. See if you can relish if you close both eyes. Every time I make an issue of it, someone dies. Carried out like a hit man, set in stone. Don't know why I even bother to be left alone. In my opinion, it's a self-serving fucked-up phase. Got a picture in my wallet that I keep, in case I. Gotta go, gotta split, gotta make it to a higher level than this. But I could be wrong, what I say is wrong, what I really want to say is…. Peel back the layers… and see what I've become. Satisfied? Now I feel nothing. Stay away - I swear it wasn't me!. Run, it doesn't matter,. I need all the miracles that I can gather. Run, I can't pretend. I put myself in idle hands again. Here's how it ends, just a bit too soon. River deep in all the shit I let myself get into. Doesn't anybody like it here?. Blank looks, television drama and no fear. Let another person fuck with your mind. I bet you become the person who will fuck in time. Man I just stopped caring, the music is blaring. I feel you glaring, WHY WON'T YOU STOP STARING?. Peel back the layers… and see what I've become. Satisfied? Now I feel nothing. Stay away - I swear it wasn't me!. Run, it doesn't matter. I need all the miracles that I can gather. Run, I can't pretend. I put myself in idle hands again. GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME!!"
imperfect,"Some things are better off forgotten.. We bury them in places that we really only visit by ourselves.. Oh and you were a version like no other.. Oh they never tell you what do when all you see is gone. What's the sense in anything when what they say is wrong?. Oh...what do you wanna hear?. Do you wanna know how many times I torn myself apart ‘cuz you're not here.. Oh...What do you wanna know?. Does it make you feel alive? I had to die to finally let you go.. Stop me. I find myself believing.. A story gets rewritten so a blasphemy is permitted once again.. Oh and you were too perfetly imperfect.. Oh they never tell you what to do when all you have are lies.. What's the sense in anything, it's just one more goodbye.. 2X. Oh...what do you wanna hear?. Do you wanna know how many times I torn myself apart ‘cuz you're not here.. Oh...what do you wanna know?. Does it make you feel alive? I had to die to finally let you go.. Finally let you go."
influence of a drowsy god,All those times before when I was just another face. Among the others keeping secrets to save myself. I could blend into the background and savor the unknown. I could practice preservation and hide behind this shell. But my gods are released on a world that is falling down. My calm is a beast that will not let me give up now. I know- I'm all or nothing. Giving my elation a little something to relax. All the others' indecisions will make me go mad. There's no time to hear the arguments or simply close my eyes. I believe this confrontation deserves my full attention. When my gods are released on a world that is falling down. My calm is a beast that will not let me give up now. I know- I'm all or nothing. I can see why nothing has happened/ promises strain. I'm writing this down as I run. Take all the examples and what have I learned?. Nothing can heal you when everything burns. My gods are released on a world that is falling down. My calm is a beast that will not let me give- up- now. I'm all or nothing. I'm all or nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing
inhale,"Come on and all and see the broken man, talking to himself. He sits and waits for something better, he´ll never find it here. The people touch his hair and pinch his cheek, he can´t even. feel it. There it goes again, he´s listening to someone. He hears the bitter laughter. And all he wants to kwon is.... [Refrão:]. Why... does any of it matter? (I can´t take it anymore). You´ve got try... the inhale that makes the exhale so much better. He wipes his hands on anything in reach, he never feels. clean. He shakes at night because his nerve is gone, every. muscle hurts. Come on and all and see what happened... that broken man is me. There it goes again, I can hear it louder. It doens´t feel good anymore. All I want to know is.... [Refrão]. Now I know I disappear!!. I cant find my way from out of here. Everything is fading on me!!. Someone tell me... someone tell me.... Someone - tell me. [Refrão 2x]. Why?!? You´ve got try!!"
inside the cynic,"I hear my poisons in the multitude. Why was I damned a human deemed too rude. Somewhere between the madness and my mind. I live with legions called the human kind. I wander aimlessly amongst the herd. Infesting shadows, I am undeterred. I give opinion cuz you give no peace. They say we manifest THE NEW DISEASE. My head EXPLODES. My soul BERATES. Erratic Bonds, They scar my face. I won't- EXIST. I won't- PERSIST. I cast a weary gaze into the crowd. Ten thousand reasons dropped into my mouth. My theoretix can't begin to live. So I have nothing more than LIFE TO GIVE. (chorus). See the lies you've given me. This is not what I should be. You say your truth isn't mine. Everything, everything, everything you say's a lie. (chorus)."

kill everybody,"Everyday I get closer and closer to releasing this on you. Roll it in, I can snap it in half and let the other make this happen to you. All I see is someone afraid of my eyes. It's inside me. You're all abortions to me. Fucking lying to me as if I don't need an apology. I don't give a fuck who you think you are. Go away. Anyway, you make me sick and it doesn't help your case. It's so serious I can't stop laughing. And I cannot wash my mouth of this taste. You try to destroy. Afraid to face the facts. I don't know how much longer I can live a lie. I want the whole world to burn every single thing. For once it's not on my head. Killing everyone. Killing everything. Killing everyone. Killing everything. My arms are dead and my veins are too. And I'm starting to believe. My head is shaking and I feel my smile. Like I've written this on a hardened ?. No-ones crying anymore. I am closing the door. I am nothing but a ?. My mind is a weapon. My finger's a gun. It's time that I give you my pain. Killing everyone. Killing everything. Killing everyone. Killing everything"
knievel has landed,"Every time I fall. I'm a little less me and a little bit more you. And everywhere I go. There's a little less there and a little bit more to lose. Did you ever wonder why. I can't decide if I'm a little bit dead or a little bit guarded. Cause even when I try. You and I are a little less there and just discarded. I threw it all away. It doesn't make it better. Why am I the ostracized. Maybe I can change. Be able to put it back together. If I'm right then I don't wanna know. Even if I could. I'll never be free from a little bit more than this. It won't do any good. Any other way is a little bit more to risk. But I say ""Fuck it, risk it! "". If we collapse, only time will tell. Obey the same disorders. And write your. I threw it all away. It doesn't make it better. Why am I the ostracized. Maybe I can change. Be able to put it back together. If I'm right then I don't wanna know. I threw it all away. It doesn't make it better.

last of the real,"Where's my crucifix?. Where're my cigarettes?. This hypodermic melancholy. Is not enough. Scratch test credit fraud. This hate is all I've got. Just feed me whiskey and you'll feel me. The time has come. Imagine all the people. Belittled and abused. You want a revolution?. I want the fuckin' truth. No voodoo ordeal. Can stop me now. I'll tear this place apart. Until you give me what I want. The last of the real. Can't stop me now. I'll tear this place apart. Until you give me what I want. Hundred dollar bills. And quiet little kills. Think you can hold me?. It'll take an army. I'm everywhere. You press into the flesh. Clichés are beat to death. Is this the best you can come up with?. Feels like despair. I made the news today. Front page above the fold. You tell me God is dead. I'll show you Hell is cold. No voodoo ordeal. Can stop me now. I'll tear this place apart. Until you give me what I want. The last of the real. Can't stop me now. I'll tear this place apart. Until you give me what I want. Until you give me what I want. Until you give me what I want. Bow your fuckin' head.

Well, you weren't born for this. No voodoo ordeal. Can stop me now. I'll tear this place apart. Until you give me what I want. The last of the real. Can't stop me now. I'll tear this place apart.

omega,"What a skeletal wreck of man this is. Translucent flesh and feeble bones. The kind of temple where the whores and villians. Try to tempt the holistic tomes. Running rampant with free thought to free form. In the free and clear. Where the matters at hand are shelled out like lint at a laundromat. To sift and focus on the bigger, better, now. We all have a little sin than needs venting. Virtues for the rending. And laws and systems. And stems ariff from the branches of office. Do you know what your post entails?. Do you serve a purpose?. Or purposely serve?. Lying down inside of your adavistic galore. The value of a Summer spent. And a Winter earned. For the rest of us there is always Sunday.. The day of the week that reeks of rest. But all we do is catch out breaths. So we can wade naked into the bloody pool. And place our hand on the big black book.. To watch the knives zig-zag between our aching fingers.. A vacation is a count-down. T-minus your life and counting. Time to drag your tongue across the sugar-cube. And hope you get a taste. What the FUCK is all this for?! (What the hell is goin' on?!). SHUT UP!!. I could go on and on, but, lets move on shall we?. Say, you're me and I'm you. And they all watch the things we do. And like a smack of spite. They threw me down the stairs. Haven't felt like this in years. The great magnet of malicious magnanamous refuse. Let me go and. Punch me into the dead spot again.. Thats where you go when theres' no one else around. It's just you. And there was never anyone to begin with now was there?. Sanctomonious pretentious dasterdly bastards. With their thumb on the pulse. And a finger on the trigger. CLASSIFIED MY ASS! that's a FUCKING secret and you know it!. Government is another way to say. Better. Than. You.. It's like ice but no pick. A murder charge that won't stick.

Another holiday. Sometimes. I even see your face. And I just wanna tear it away. If only from my mind. Sometimes. I’d like to see you about it. Then again, I can do without it. Maybe some other time. Sell yourself a reason. Take yourself outside. And through it all the truth comes out. You’re still alone inside. Sell yourself a reason. Take yourself outside.

I never understood how much I could take. Then I saw the worst was over. When I laid my eyes on you. It was all that I could do to know my place. Out of all the vast illusions. Out of all the dreams come true. I was gone until I finally saw your face. If you cried out for more. If you reached out for me. I would run into the storm. Just to keep you here with me. I have gone beyond my years. I've wasted half my life. But I found it all in you. Did I save you?. 'Cause I know you saved me too. Let me take a step towards you. Let me feel you in my hands.

What I tried to accomplish died – every offer of faith I had. To fight and a dream unfolds. The moon is cold because the sun left early. And the days go by, even when my conscience just won’t try. Every week decays, every month is rotten -. I AM FORGOTTEN. I fall… I had to let you go. I fall…my mind is all I know. I fall… the table turns to dust. I fall… today, I let go of my trust. What a waste of time I am, every ounce of life is. Just dead flesh. I can’t forget, but then again you can’t let me remember. When I try to speak, every word I say comes out so bleak.

It's a town that never does anything and yet takes all the credit. A place that promises so much,. But never has a thing to say,. Or a care in the world. There is no memory here. No dream for itself but the dreams of others. And all over the world you talk of a place you've only seen in re-runs. Immorallized for it's vice, and deified for it's carnage. (There's money in the air there). (All you have to do is reach up and grab it). In basements, garages, parking lots, empty lots, schoolyards, town cars, backrooms and more. Diamonds are fashioned from expectations and fortified on a steady diet,. of simple lives and red carpets. The ejaculating zeitgeist in nightvision. Culture is a punchline and emotion is blood in the water. The sharks here play games you can't fathom. But you flock here anyway. On college money and credit cards. Spend a week bullshitting yourself that it was all true. All of it. Just to watch in horror as it all falls to pieces under the gravity of reality. The stary eyes fade as it dawns on you. Nothing is garanteed. You are a part of the great divide. The choosen or the frozen. Now your mouth's away without a net. Your college money's a collage of debt. and your credit cards are all snapped in fucking half. time to wander a landscape bereft of mercy. This is now the backlot of your failed movie. A waking dream re-written without your permission. The real luster, the soft focus, the.... Soap opera vision is just the hindsight of a world who's been lied to. Of sad surfs and untouchable lords. You took a chance didn't you?. But chance didn't have a par for you this time around, maybe next life. And you can't even walk home. The girls on the streets all look sad in this cardboard cut-out little town. (huh) No wonder. That's the only thing here that's real. The gold is for fools. And paradise is lost but the hungry have never bothered with the cost. Day by day they fall away like rose pedals. Like ink that won't dry or fade. It just runs wild down cracks and crevices, grooves and folds. so I hope someone saves you before you get cold. I really do. Because the girls are all sad in this little black book.

the witness trees,"I don't know what I need. I'm scared of life, I'm scared of what it means to me. This broken home is just not what it used to me. Too fast to slow me down. Too loud to drown me out. I doubt I'll ever get this ghost to what I was. Because I've seen the grim design as I hold on. I hope you talk about the future when I'm gone. But if I'm wrong I know the reason why. I, I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything that's under my control. I, I won't do anything. I won't do anything that's out of my control. I can see myself. Extended past the limits of my cry for help. I don't believe I've ever come this way before. So why do I know my way. What do I have to say and do. To drain that look of shame away from you. I knew we'd never find our peace. Hold on, I hope you celebrate the best before I'm gone. But if I'm wrong I'll know that it was me. I, I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything that's under my control. I, I won't do anything. I won't do anything that's out of my, out of my control. I don't know what you need. I'm scared of love, I'm scared of what it means to me. This empty house is burning down around me. So cold I don't know why. So much for holding out. I hope I suffocate before I let you choke. On words you know I'd never say. Oh no. don't go. I want you to destroy me one more time. So when I die. I'll know you really loved me. I, I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything that's under my control. I, I won't do anything. I won't do anything that's out of my, out of my control. Out of my control, yeah"

This time - It's better this way.. Come on.... Help me out,. I'm too proud,. I can't stop,. Let me out,. So go ahead and blame me, but then we're dying the same disease. Somehow you've gotten youself confused with my enemies.. I'm always right, the difference is I didn't hide, so. Come on, look me in the eyes and try and tell me you never lied.. Man, you should have seen this coming from the time you began to run,. Big man looking down the barrel of your own gun. This isn't right, you're not the one who pays the price,. Welcome to your real life, SURPRISE!. You Say - Whatever. You Say - You are what. You Say - I can't believe what. You Say - You aren't what. You Say - I'm not what. And it gets to you,. But you can't stop it too,. All the things that you,. Said you'd never wanna do. Let me out, let me out. Face in the crowd, youself so proud. Let me out, let me out.

threadbare,"Hold your breath and say goodbye - you never say a word. When you feel like your heart's gone wrong. When you feel like you've stayed too long... it's over. Letting go has let you down - just let me show you why. Every life is a chance to try. We can live like we both can't die. Oh in all this time. I never wanted to destroy a dream come true. And in all this time. I never wanted to destroy someone like you. I want you to stay. So give me a sign - give me your hand - I'll take you home. In the dark, we're all the same - we only seem alone. There's a place where we all must hide. There's a place that we lock from the inside... when it's over. Everything we ever were and everything we are. We will heal as the days roll by. Cuz in the end... it's you and I. Oh in all this time. I never wanted to destroy a dream come true. And in all this time. I never wanted to destroy someone like you. I want you to stay. So give me a sign - give me your hand - I'll take you home. We are sewn inside the fabric that is holding us together. We can only pray that something so tragic will save us all. Will save us all - We are on our own again. We are on our own again. Oh in all this time. I never wanted to destroy a dream come true. And in all this time. I never wanted to destroy someone like you. And in all this time. I never wanted to destroy. A dream come true. And in all this time. I never wanted to destroy. Someone like you. I want you to stay.

through glass,"I'm looking at you through the glass. Don't know how much time has passed. Oh God, it feels like forever. But no one ever tells you that forever. Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head. How do you feel? That is the question. But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer. When something like a soul becomes. Initialized and folded up like paper dolls and little notes. You can't expect a bit of hopes. So while you're outside looking in. Describing what you see. Remember what you're staring at is me. Cause I'm looking at you through the glass. Don't know how much time has passed. All I know is that it feels like forever. No one ever tells you that forever. Feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head. How much is real? So much to question. An epidemic of the mannequins. Contaminating everything. When thought came from the heart.

tired,"I'm alive in here. So alive in here. Pulling down a little peace. I'm open wide in here. Slow to rise in here. Saving grace and killing me. You say this only makes me incomplete.

Somewhere I know, I know, I'll never live in chains. The one, is now aware, so stay away from me. I'm just too young to care!. I can see in here. I can feel in here. Comatose with common sense.

voices again,"I'm in my room. I'm biding my time. My finger's on the trigger. Committing a crime. My life is good for nothin'. And yet I don't know. I'm split decision. God, which way should I go. It's all a joke. Humanity's dead. The streets are easy pickins'. All bodies and heads. Referring to a fervor. It's hard to rise above. When you're stuck in a hole. I've been seen and I've been heard. To think like that is so absurd. And where's your concentration in a maze. I'm hearing voices again. Now I'm free. I take what I want. And no one even bothers. To bugger my hunt. A scary contradiction that you fail to believe. Of the horror and the menace. I'm about to conceive. Take my hand and mark my words. When I say it's all a blur. And can't you see I'm asking you for help. I'm hearing voices again. I've got no one to show me. No bars no wall can hold me. You think you're safe with distance. You don't know my persistence. They play with my intentions. Deceiving my perception. This is my last advance. No second chance"
we die young,"Scary's on the wall. Scary's on his way. Watch where you spit. I'd advise you wait until it's over. Then you got hit. And you shoulda known better. And we die young. Faster we run. Down, down, down you're rolling. Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer. Take another hit. And bury your brother. And we die young. Faster we run. Scary's on the wall. Scary's on his way. Another alley trip. Bullet seeks the place to bend you over. Then you got hit. And you shoulda known better. Faster we run. And we die young"

I put up my best, but I'm still afraid. Propped up by lies and promises. Saving my place as life forgets. Maybe it's time I saw the world. I'm only here for a while. Patience it's not my style. And I'm so tired that I gotta go. What am I supposed to want now. What am I supposed to do?. Did you really think I wouldn't see this through?. Tell me I should stick around for you. Tell me I could have it all. And still I'm too tired to care and I gotta go. I get to go home in one week. But I'm leaving home in three weeks. They throw me a bone just to pick me dry. I'm following soothing directions. I crawled up inside for protection. I'm told what to do and I don't know why. I'm over-existing in limbo. I'm over the myths and placebos. I don't really mind if I just fade away. I'm ready to live with my family. I'm ready to die in obscurity. 'cause I'm so tired that I gotta go. What am I supposed to want now?. What am I supposed to do?. Still don't think I wouldn't see this through?. Tell me I am part of history. Tell me I can have it all. And still I'm too tired to care and I gotta go.
