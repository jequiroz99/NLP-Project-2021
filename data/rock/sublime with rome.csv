Hit it once you wont believe this. You say your mind is racing. Well I'm just trying to help you pace it. See i be floating around space ships. All up in there where them planes is. Mixing my green with my breakfast. Waking, bakin. I'ma roll my weed up everyday. Smoke everyday. Party everyday. Try'na reach the clouds. Are you on your way?. I'm rollin up good you rollin up trash. I'm burnin them slow you burnin them fast. You smokin on this I'm smokin on that. Ain't countin them grams just go in the bag. You rollin a blunt I'm rollin a zag. We grindin it up and mixin with hash and thats. [Chorus]. Can you feel it. Got my head in the clouds and I can't come down. Can you feel it. Got my head in the clouds and I won't come down. Can you feel it. Got my head in the clouds and I can't come down. Can you feel it. No and I won't come down. [Verse 3]. And I push up weight. Because I don't like the way. Cut out a puncher. And shoved it in my face. Nobody or nothin can tell bus up in construction. Because we're comin out too late anyways. Traveling around the world. Serving the taste. [Chorus]. Can you feel it. Got my head in the clouds and I can't come down. Can you feel it. Got my head in the clouds and I won't come down. Can you feel it. Got my head in the clouds and I can't come down. Can you feel it. No I won't come down"
