But he was wrong. I'm your jezebel. (She said). On my way to hell. (She said). What a price to pay. To feel like you're alive. She was blind. When she said. It's all the same. No matter where you are. She said. But she was wrong. It's all the same. No matter where you are. By Matt
another love song,"You’re so impossible. Scream and moan, chills my soul. Don’t want to hear you got left behind. All the times you stayed up and cried. It’s no lie, you did it to yourself. Like chewed up gum under my shelf. Don’t look surprised,. You must have known all along. It’s just another love song. It’s never easy, it’s not hard. When you’ve lost your mind. With you it’s sleazy,. Don’t tell me your worries. I’m sick, I’ll leave you blind. Now the time has come, to leave this love. That’s left you dry. No need to work it out,. Cause you know there’s no reason why. It’s just another love song. I never told you it would last forever. You can’t hold this boy for long, dear. By the time you read my letter. Baby I’ll be gone. Your just another love song."
