crop circles,"Look at all the crazies sleeping in the square. They seem to be so lazy since some love affair. Drowned by years that come and go. Left them so mad. But have you seen the aliens invading our earth?. Fearful while sailing, violating some crop. They cannot hide the beauty behind. The circles on ground, why can it scare?. I can feel it all around my thoughts. On entire universe. I can tell you secrets from the storm. A rainbow wherever you goes. Can tell you how it hurts. Can tell you why it worth. Whatever I know is wrong. Wherever I go there's lovee"
dancing in the land of suns,"Cold and vast and dark. Leave this vacuum, girl. Alone in the bright crowd. Dancing around the mass of her glow. When the spaceship goes. Through the vast unknown. Looking for some hope. Where there is none. The cosmonaut says. What did I threw away?. A moon where I could stay. In the land of suns. Someday wasted in time. She ran away from home. But however much she tries it. She will never leave a world. Made up on her own head. By Immaculate dreams. Stuck on her songs. There will be people all around. A thousand sad dots on their own. And she has to dance all night. Even if the sun never comes. While the days became so long. She wanna get back to say her sorry. Blue and vast and wise. Are the planets on her eyes. If I get near, every light-year. From the atmosphere up the horizon of her curves"
like a gentleman,"Don't have time for you. That's what you said. But what makes me sick. You're not so sure. If you really wanted this. It's clear to me. Oh, I tried to full myself. Or I tried to insist. But I should give up, I should give up. Like a gentleman, let you go. I'll have time for me. Will you get there?. You can keep all my love. All I ever said. If you really wanted this. It's clear to me. Oh, I tried to full myself. Or I tried to insist"
simply happens,A morning after. One night before. I talked to you. But I wanted more. I needed to say. I know it's hurry. We don't choose. Simply happens. I could not hide. I needed to say. Maybe I want you. But what I feel inside. I don't wanna hurt me. But I have to try. I would try to make the best I could. You are a not problem. You are better than you think. A dream about change. And the changes are good. Sometimes we don't realize. I could not hide. I needed to say. Maybe I want you. But what I feel inside. I don't wanna hurt me. But I have to try. I would try to make the best I could. You are a not a problem. you are better than you think. You are better than me
we'll meet again,"She came as the sun goes. Leading all her light. To the dark side of my life. Dawn our love, hold me tight, so tight. The morning was made of the heat. She brought past night. Throught my window a frame of our lifes. Our time can't be taken from us. That's why she is never sleeping. All your dreams can blind. Be awake right on, it's time. Right on time we cannot deny. The morning was made of the heat. She brought past night. Throught my window a frame of our lifes. Our time can't be taken from us. As if we don't know. Well I can easy your pain. As if we're not gone. Tonight we'll meet again"
