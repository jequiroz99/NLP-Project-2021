librarian,"Walk across the courtyard,. Towards the library.. I can hear the insects buzz on the leaves, 'neath my feet.. Ramble up the stairwell,. To the hall of books.. Since we got the interweb these hardly get used.. Duck into the men's room,. Combing through my hair.. When God gave us mirrors he had no idea.. Looking for a lesson. In the periodicals,. There I spy you listening to the AM radio.. Karen of the Carpenters,. Singing in the rain.. Another lovely victim of the mirror's evil way.. It's not like you're not trying,. With a pencil in your hair,. To defy the beauty the good Lord put in there. Simple little bookworm,. Buried underneath. Is the sexiest librarian.. Take off those glasses and let down your hair for me.. So I watch you through the bookcase,. Imagining a scene.. You and I had dinner,. Spending time when you sleep.. And what can I say to you,. Lying there in bed.. These words were the kiss I would play in your head.. What is it inside our heads. That makes us do the opposite,. Makes us do the opposite. Of what's right for us.. 'Cause everything be great,. And everything be good,. And everybody gave,. Like everybody could.. Sweetest little bookworm,. Hidden underneath. Is the sexiest librarian.. Take off those glasses and let down your hair for me.. Take off those glasses, and let down your hair for me.. Simple little beauty,. Heaven in your breath.. Simplest of pleasures. The world at its best."

take my breath away,Watching every motion. In my foolish lover's game. On this endless ocean. Finally lovers know no shame. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn around and say. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching I keep waiting. Still anticipating love. Never hesitating. To become the fated ones. Turning and returning. To some secret place to hide. Watching in slow motion. As you turn to me and say. My love. Take my breath away. Through the hourglass I saw you. In time you slipped away. When the mirror crashed I called you. And turned to hear you say. If only for today. I am unafraid. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching every motion. In this foolish lover's game. Haunted by the notion. Somewhere there's a love in flames. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn my way and say. Take my breath away. My love (repeat and fade)

Cause the day is coming. The day is near. The day is coming. You know what I mean. The day is coming. The way is clear. The day has come"
the way that he sings,"why's it so strange when they say that the world's movin upwards?. Why's it surreal when my hands feel they cant roll the dice?. Why's it so great just to wake every day, alive and by your side.. It's a mystery I guess, there's lots of things I cant find.. Its not the way that you look, but your move that catches my eye.. Why's it so soft when the cannons unload on the others?. Why're we so loud when we say it wont happen to us?. Why does my mind blow to bits every time they play that song?. It's just the way that he sings,. not the words that he says, or the band.. Im in love with this soul, it's a meaning that I understand."
they ran,"somebody stole my lighter. and where it go'd is higher.. i was another boy, down in another town. armed with casino bars, tight. whores and tinseltown. but i stayed. oooo. oh but i stayed.. she had a cigarette and asked if i had a light. out it came, and i gave it. to her, and off into the night..... his arms were thin, and off into the. night, they ran. oooo they ran. oooo they ran."
thin line,[Verse 1]. You never say enough. Woohoo I said too much. Come on open up. Woohoo I must stay shut. Well it's a thin line between lovin'. And wastin' my time. Thin line. [Chorus]. Give it chimers. Crazy diamonds. Head out towards the sea. Nobody loves you. Except for me. [Verse 2]. Close to overflow. Woohoo our wells run low. Longing to make the cut. You can walk but oh don't touch. Cuz it's a thin line between lovin'. And wastin' my time. Thin line between lovin' and wastin' my time. [Chorus]. Give it chimers. Crazy diamonds. Head out towards the sea. Nobody loves you. Except for me
this land is your land,"This land is your land this land is my land. From california to the new york island. From the red wood forest to the gulf stream waters. This land was made for you and me. As I was walking that ribbon of highway. I saw above me that endless skyway. I saw below me that golden valley. This land was made for you and me. As I went walking I saw a sign there. And on the sign it said: ""no trespassing. "". But on the other side it didn't say nothing. That side was made for you and me. Nobody living can ever stop me. As I go walking that freedom highway. Nobody living can ever make me turn back. This land was made for you and me"
touch me i'm going to scream,"Touch me, i'm going to scream if you don't. inside i know you got the feeling that you won't, oh. i know it sounds confusing, but it makes a lot of sense. throw a bone across the ocean, dig a hole under the fence. touch me, i'm going to scream if you don't. inside i know we get the feeling that you won't. i can tell by the way you smile, i'm smiling, too. i see myself in you. i can tell by the sounds you make when you are pleased. you see yourself in me. touch me, i'm going to scream if you don't. inside i know we got the feeling that you won't. how many nights can a soul so full of life remain untouched?. how can a soul make the most of what is old and what is dear?. i need a human right by my side, untied, untied."
touch me i'm gonna scream part 2,"...If you touch me, well I just think I'll scream. Cuz it's been so long, since someone has touched me. And made me think... about the way things are....

tropics (erase traces),Tropics. Off the map. Thr'u the glass ceiling. On the right path. Out of body for the first time. In a long time. The right time. Window to another world. Worked all day. Worked all nite. Gettin' nowhere. Drove all day. Drove all night. Going nowhere. Out of print. Threw caution to the wind. Window to another world. Tropics. Off the map. Thru the glass ceiling. On the right path. Out of body for the first time. In a long time. The right time. Heart of progress. Strange as it seems. In suspended animation. On the same page. Tastes change. Frame by frame. Erase traces. Of the past. Do the math. Repeats itself. Best of friends. Until the end. If given the chance. The silent observer. Watching always [x2]
two halves,"Remember when you were seventeen. You goin' crazy, you know what I mean. It wasn't that long ago. In the grand scheme of things. It wasn't that long ago. You think you're so much smarter now. Twenty one everything stays in place. Forty one some things start to fade. Well when you're so young, you wanna be older.

victory dance,"Should I close my eyes and prophesize. Hoping maybe someday come. Should I wet the ground with my own tears. Crying over whats been done. Should I lift the dirt and plant the seed. If I knew I'll never grow. Should I wet the ground with the sweat from my brow. And believe in my good work. My good work. My good work. My good work. Hey there, I'm flying up above. Looking down on the tired earth. And I can see, I can see potential. Speaking through you, speaking to you. From all of heaven's possibilities. Power, hey do know how it works. Hey do you know that the meek, they shall inherit the earth. You should work, you should work. leaving with something of ?. Should I hit the water or stay on dry land. Even though I've never swam. Take machete into the brush. Though at first there is no (man?). Taste the war paint on my tongue. As it's dripping with my sweat. Place my gaze in the futures path. Seeing things that ain't come yet. Hope to watch the victory dance. After whole day's work is done. Hope to watch the victory dance. In the evening's setting sun. Hope to watch the victory dance. over many lives to come. Hope to watch the victory dance. In the evening's setting sun. Setting sun. setting sun. setting sun. Hope to dance the victory dance. After whole day's work is done. Hope to dance the victory dance. In the evening's setting sun. Hope to dance the victory dance. Over many lives to come. Hope to dance the victory dance. In the evening's setting sun"

west end girls,"Sometimes you're better off dead. There's gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head. You think you're mad, too unstable. Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables.

The East End boys and West End girls. In a West End town, a dead end world. The East End boys and West End girls. West End girls. Too many shadows, whispering voices.

what a wonderful man,"He Was Leading Us Thru The Dark. He Was Sayin That ""Love Goes On."". I Was Wanting Some ""Ice Cream."" He Knew Exactly What I Meant.. From The Driver's Seat In The Dark. He Popped A Tape In The Dash Of His Car.. And When The Singer Started To Scream. I Knew Exactly What He Meant.. I Never Knew For Sure - What A Wonderful Man He Was.. What A Sensible Man He Was. What A Marvelous Man He Was.. Why Do We Love What Is Wrong? Big Devil Told Us To Sing Along.. And Like A Loving Flock We Obey - Except 4 Him - He Went His Own Way.. I Never Knew For Sure - What A Wonderful Man He Was.. Till The Day I Found Out His Cause - Was To Do It For All Of Us."
where to begin,"Up and up and up I climb. When I came up I was so far behind. My head takes a lickin'. But my heart keeps on tickin. Just the same. Always startin' over but somehow. I always know where to begin. Round and round and round I ride. And just when I looked I hadn't even began. To feel the effect. A cool, dark fever. On the brain. That feelin' takin' over. Like a holy rollercoaster. To the grave. How can I await the day. The last the night I'm here to see. How do I await the mother lode. It's the art of feelin naked in your clothes. Again, again, again I tried. That's how I knew I would never be denied. That face in the mirror. Who could it be, it was my own. That cool, dark figure. That's when I knew I was alone. On and on and on I drive. when will I know I've finally arrived. So far I've gone, so far to go. It never ends. Always startin over but somehow I always know where to begin. Always startin over but somehow I always know where to begin. Always startin over but somehow I always know where to begin"
wonderful (the way i feel),"It matters to me. Took a long time to get here. If it would have been easy. I would not have cared. Like a tropical forest. Like a cop on the beat. When all is order. You get lost in the heat. I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel. I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel. Doesn't matter to me. I could take it or leave it. I could learn from way back when. And still live right now. With the sun on my shoulder. And the wind in my back. I will never grow older. At least not in my mind. I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel. I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel. So wonderful, wonderful the way I feel. I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel. I'm going where there ain't no fear. I'm going where the spirit is near. I'm going where the living is easy. And the people are kind. A new state of mind. I'm going where there ain't no police. I'm going where there ain't no disease. I'm going where there ain't no need. To escape from what is. Only spirits at ease"
