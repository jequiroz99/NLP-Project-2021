better than me,I think you can do much better than me. After all the lies that I made you believe. Guilt kicks in and I start to see. The edge of the bed. Where your nightgown used to be. I told myself I wouldn't miss you. But I remembered. What it feels like beside you. I really miss your hair in my face. And the way your innocence tastes. And I think you should know this. You deserve much better than me. While looking through your old box of notes. I found those pictures. That you were looking for. If there's one memory I don't want to lose. That time at the mall. You and me in the dressing room. I told myself I won't miss you. But I remembered. What it feels like beside you. I really miss your hair in my face. And the way your innocence tastes. And I think you should know this. You deserve much better than me. The bed I'm lying in is getting colder. Wish I never would've said it's over. And I can't pretend that I won't think about you any longer. Cause we never really had a closure. This can't be the end. I really miss your hair in my face. And the way your innocence tastes. And I think you should know this. You deserve much better than me. I really miss your hair in my face. And the way your innocence tastes. And I think you should know this. You deserve much better than me. (And I think you should know this). (You deserve much better than me)

the life,I'm leaving tonight down the same dirt road. A million times I've driven just to get home. And I ain't ever looking back for nothing. Headed for the coast looking for the high life. Everybody knows it's nothing but a good time. And I sold everything I had for something I can't seem to find. (Chorus:). So this is the life they talked about. This is the I can't live without. When the real world crashes down. Oh if they could see me now. When all the dreams are all your own. Turn to nightmares all alone. It hits you right between the eyes. This is the life. This is the life. These four walls feel more like a prison. Instead of pure highs I couldn't wait to live in. So I just drink myself to sleep again. Can't escape my mind this ain't like a movie. It's getting hard to hide the more it's doin to me. Don't know how long I can keep from going. Crazy all the time. (Chorus:). So this is the life they talked about. This is the I can't live without. When the real world crashes down. Oh if they could see me now. When all the dreams are all your own. Turn to nightmares all alone. It hits you right between the eyes. This is the life. This is the life. Nothing's ever what it seems. Maybe that grass ain't so green. Nothing's ever out of reach. When you're seventeen. (Chorus:). So this is the life they talked about. This is the I can't live without. When the real world crashes down. Oh if they could see me now. When all the dreams are all your own. Turn to nightmares all alone. It hits you right between the eyes. This is the life. This is the life. Yeah

While my mistress she calls me. To stand in her spotlight again. Tonight won't be alone. To know that don't. Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove. For it's you that I'd die to defend.

Then I got a slap in the face. If i could go back in time. Wouldn't change a damn thing in my life. Love the dumb things we do when we're young. But the best is yet to come. My first drinking lesson. I followed all my friends. Stole liquor went down to the lake. I got durnk on. Weed mixed with whiskey. Hell I got so dizzy was more than my stomach could take. If i could go back in time. Wouldn't change a damn thing in my life. Love the dumb things we do when we're young. But the best is yet to come. Go for it. Run toward it. Dive in head first. Live life with no regret. Put your heart out there. Don't be scared you might get hurt. But your thing is in the end. Because the best is yet to come. My last high school lesson. Scared of graduation. Tipped a few back and showed up too late. Well my mom got mad hell my dad he just laughed. And said, son I have done the same thing. Just go for it. Run toward it. Dive in head first. Live life with no regret. Put your heart out there. Don't be scared you might get hurt. But your thing is in the end. Because the best is yet to come. the best is yet to come. the best is yet to come"
the life,I'm leaving tonight down the same dirt road. A million times I've driven just to get home. And I ain't ever looking back for nothing. Headed for the coast looking for the high life. Everybody knows it's nothing but a good time. And I sold everything I had for something I can't seem to find. (Chorus:). So this is the life they talked about. This is the I can't live without. When the real world crashes down. Oh if they could see me now. When all the dreams are all your own. Turn to nightmares all alone. It hits you right between the eyes. This is the life. This is the life. These four walls feel more like a prison. Instead of pure highs I couldn't wait to live in. So I just drink myself to sleep again. Can't escape my mind this ain't like a movie. It's getting hard to hide the more it's doin to me. Don't know how long I can keep from going. Crazy all the time. (Chorus:). So this is the life they talked about. This is the I can't live without. When the real world crashes down. Oh if they could see me now. When all the dreams are all your own. Turn to nightmares all alone. It hits you right between the eyes. This is the life. This is the life. Nothing's ever what it seems. Maybe that grass ain't so green. Nothing's ever out of reach. When you're seventeen. (Chorus:). So this is the life they talked about. This is the I can't live without. When the real world crashes down. Oh if they could see me now. When all the dreams are all your own. Turn to nightmares all alone. It hits you right between the eyes. This is the life. This is the life. Yeah

what ya gonna do,"I'm living life with no regrets. They're on their way but ain't here yet. I just left Las Vegas in bad, bad shape. I only call home if I get the chance. Every other night a new romance. Wake up just in time to miss the day. And now I'm talking to the man in the mirror. And I think I heard him say. What ya gonna do. When the whiskey ain't working no more?. Life don't feel like before. What ya gonna do?. What ya gonna do. When the ride ain't climbing no more?. Nobody's beatin' down your door. What ya gonna do?. And I'm still closing down these streets. I'm high enough to make believe. That I ain't ever gonna hit the ground. The one that got away from me. Every now and then she calls to see. If I'm alive or plan to settle down. Well, I called her drunk last night. And I think I heard her say. What ya gonna do. When the whiskey ain't working no more?. Life don't feel like before. What ya gonna do?. What ya gonna do. When the ride ain't climbing no more?. Nobody's beatin' down your door. What ya gonna do?. I can't sleep and I can't hide. 'Cause the voices in my head are getting louder. Getting louder every night. What ya gonna do. When the whiskey ain't working no more?. Life don't feel like before. What ya gonna do?. What ya gonna do. When the ride ain't climbing no more?. Nobody's beatin' down your door. What ya gonna do?. What ya gonna do. When the whiskey ain't working no more?. Life don't feel like before. What ya gonna do?. What ya gonna do. When the ride ain't climbing no more?. Nobody's beatin' down your door. What ya gonna do?. What ya gonna do. When the whiskey ain't working no more?. Life don't feel like before. What ya gonna do?"
wings of a butterfly,"Wings Of A Butterfly lyrics. Heaven ablaze in our eyes. We're standing still in time. The blood on our hands is the wine. We offer as sacrifice. [Chorus]. Come on, and show them your love. Rip out the wings of a butterfly. For your soul, my love. Rip out the wings of a butterfly. For your soul. This endless mercy mile. We're crawling side by side. With hell freezing over in our eyes. Gods kneel before our crime. [Chorus]. Come on lets show, them your love. Rip out the wings of a butterfly. For your soul, my love. Rip out the wings of a butterfly. For your soul. (Rip out the wings of a butterfly). Don’t let go. (Rip out the wings of a butterfly). For your soul. [Chorus]. Come on, and show them your love. Rip out the wings of a butterfly. For your soul, my love. Rip out the wings of a butterfly. For your soul. (Rip out the wings of a butterfly). Don’t let go. (Rip out the wings of a butterfly) [x2].

without you,"I just wanna be alone tonight. I just wanna take a little breather. 'Cause lately all we do is fight. And every time it cuts me deeper. Cause something's changed. You've been acting so strange. And it's taken it's toll on me. It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave. chorus:. Without you I live it up a little more every day. Without you I'm seeing myself so differently. I didn't wanna believe it then. But it all worked out in the end. When I watched you walk away. Well, I never thought I would say. I'm fine without you. Called you up 'cause it's been long enough. And you said that you were so much better. We have done a lot of growing up. We were never meant to be together. Cause something's changed. You were acting so strange. And it's taken it's toll on me. It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave. chorus:. Without you I live it up a little more every day. Without you I'm seeing myself so differently. I didn't wanna believe it then. But it all worked out in the end. When I watched you walk away. Well, I never thought I would say. I'm fine without you. Cause something's changed. You were acting so strange. And it's taken it's thorn on me. It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave. chorus"
