johnny b. goode,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans. Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,. There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood. Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode,. Who never ever learned to read or write so well. But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.. (Chorus). Go Go. Go Johnny Go Go (x4). Johnny B. Goode. He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,. Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track. Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,. Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,. People passin' by they would stop and say. ""Oh my but that little country boy can play"". (Chorus). His momma told him ""some day you will be a man,. And you will be the leader of a big ol' band. Many people comin' from miles around,. To hear you play your music till the sun go down,. Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin. 'Johnny B. Goode' tonight"". (Chorus)"
you never can tell,"It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well. You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle. And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell. They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale. The coolerator was crammed with Tv dinners and ginger ale,. But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell. They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast. Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz. But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell. They bought a souped-up jitney, 'twas a cherry red '53,. They drove it down to Orleans to celebrate the anniversary. It was there that Pierre was married to the lovely mademoiselle. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell. It had a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well. You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle. And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell"

Till it took him to vindicate take the feelings she had. She pleaded as she promised every prayer she could. Till everybody whispered to her, ""Lady B. Goode"".

Everybody liked her and was knocking on wood. But soon there came a baby from the Lady B. Goode. She wondered if he's ever coming back someday. The brighter lights and glory may just keep him away. But then he wrote and told her ""Do not be dismayed. The love you have for me will never be betrayed. They want me do a movie about my livelihood. And I want you to play the part of Lady B. Goode"". She went to see the movie when it hit the screen. Babysitting Johnnie Jr. down in New Orleans. He saw his daddy sing the song he heard in school. The one his mother told him about the golden rule.

you can't catch me,"I bought a brand new airmobile. It was custom made. It was a Flight DeVille. With an powerful motor. And some hideaway wings. Push in on the button and you can hear her sing. Now you can't catch me. No, baby, you can't catch me. 'Cause if you get too close. You know I'm gone like a cool breeze. New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours. I was rolling slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers. Up come a flattop he was movin' up with me. Then come wavin' goodbye. In a little old souped up mini. I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll. Moanin' sirens, for the state patrol. So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn. Bye-bye New Jersey I become airborne. Now you can't catch me. No, baby you can't catch me. 'Cause if you get too close. You know I'm gone like a cool breeze. Flyin' with my baby last Saturday night. Wasn't a gray cloud floatin' in sight. Big full moon shinin' up above. Cuddle up honey be my love. Sweetest little thing that I ever seen. I'm gonna name you Mabelline. Flyin' on the beam set on flight control. Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll. Two, three hours a-passin' by. Altitude dropped to 505. Fuel consumption way too fast. Let's get on home before we run out of gas. Now you can't catch me. No baby, you can't catch me. 'Cause if you get too close. You know I'm gone like a cool breeze."

I know a swingin' little joint where we can jump and shout. It's not too far back off the highway, not so long a ride. You park your car out in the open, you can walk inside. A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am. Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed. Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away. I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day. And if you wanna hear some music like the boys are playin'. Hold tight, pat your foot, don't let 'em carry it away. Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud. Oh, don't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd. You can't dance, I know you wish you could.

she still loves you,She came to me when. My own heart was in much need of hers. Sometimes we'll try and reach. For things we know we each want and don't deserve. I felt I was wrong it seemed she belonged to someone else. She heard my words and trust. But in her arms I just could not help myself. [Chorus]. It showed she was blue. She talked about you the whole night through. I don't think you'll ever know. How sincerely she is so much in love with you. When she came to me. It was so hard to see. How she loved you so. I wonder if you know. Someone should tell you so. Because she'll never will. A few times that she. Had turned towards me. She was so blue. And hungry just to hear. The words of love as clear. Come to her from you. When I gave up on her. As much as we were both lonely and blue. She still love you so. I thought you out to know. She still loves you

I guess my head was full of nothing but rock. I guess my head was full of nothing but rock. Hear they're swinging the Fox Trot at the hotel. Hear the country picking 'round the clock. Pick up some sounds of the jazz around. But if you dig what you hear, you dig rock. Ah, if you dig what you hear, you dig rock. The thing I'm gon' tell my dick jock.

You're fortunate if you have time to eat. Back in the classroom open you books. Gee but the teacher don't know. How mean she looks. Soon as three o'clock rolls around. You finally lay your burden down. Close up your books, get out of your seat. Down the halls and into the street. Up to the corner and 'round the bend. Right to the juke joint you go in. *Drop the coin right into the slot. You gotta hear something that's really hot. With the one you love you're makin' romance. All day long you been. Wantin' to dance. Feelin' the music from head to toe. 'Round and 'round and 'round you go. (*Repeat). Hail, hail rock'n'roll. Deliver me from the days of old. Long live rock'n'roll.

When my drifting days are done. Well, I'm aimlessly drifting. Looks like I live from day to day. Hard as I try to make a showing. Something is always in my way. Even the one I truly love now. Deals in the games that people play. Every time I love I always lose. Seems like I'll never ever win. Each I hear them lonesome blues. I'm all alone at home again. Seems like I'm just existing. Aimlessly drifting to no end. All that I ask of this old world. Is just to have a happy home. All that I ask of one little girl. Is just to be my very own. It seems just like I'm just existing. Aimlessly drifting along. Yes, I'll go to California. Seems like I'm always on the run. Nobody ever needs a loser. I just exist under the sun. But someday, somehow, someone may need me. But my drifting days be done."

The first song he ever learned had a strong boogie beat. Come on now. Rock it, rock it, rock it along. Roll it, roll it, roll it on. Git it, git it, git it on. Got it, got it, got it and gone. Then one day it happened, they hauled him off to war. Way over there in no man's land, just him and his guitar. Nobody near to love him, nobody ever sent him news. What could a poor boy do at night, but to sit down and sing them blues. Early one morning they called him, oh, what a beautiful day. They packed him in an old army plane and flew him back home to stay. He landed in Clark Air base, but didn't have no place to go. So he sit down with his guitar in the middle of the street and gave everybody a free show.."

his daughter caroline,"So few years ago her daddy held her in his arms. Snugged the blanket around her feet to help and keep 'em warm. When he kissed her tender cheek, oh, how her eyes would shine. His ev'ry dream was built around his daughter Caroline. He remembered ev'ry time she'd turn another year. And, at the birthday parties, when he'd shed a happy tear. Thinking of the wedding dress that she would wear someday. When he'd have to give his daughter Caroline away. He thought of what he saw the night they called her from the roll. A silver graduation ring and engagement ring of gold. It seems as tho' twas yesterday he met her valentine. And now she's grown and here to wed his daughter Caroline. Maarching on his arm she whispered, ""Pa, I still love you"". Those words remained within his ears when she vowed, ""I do"". Cheer was sparkling from his eyes, but tears were in behind. When he gave his heart away, his daughter Caroline."

And doing things that lovers do. Oh, if I only knew where to write you. Or where to call you on the phone. To let you know how much I need you. And miss your love since you been gone. I want to tell you you were right, doll. And I see now that I was wrong. I want you back, won't somebody help me. I need your love, honest I do. To relive those happy hours.

I talked to you, and you talked to me and we talked to one another. It don't take us but a few minutes to understand each other. If I was twenty-three years old and you were twenty-two. I bet no one would try to run our lives the way they do. We take a chance and try romance, be true to one another. It don't take us but a few minutes, when we want each other. If I was in San Diego and you were in Portland, Maine. I'd fly to you lock, stock and bone in hail and pouring rain. Over the mountains, through the valleys, coming home to each other. It don't take us but a few minutes to get to one another. You would write a love song and play on my guitar. And if you should, in Hollywood, become a movie star. Would you let your heart forget, I loved you and you only. It don't take but a few minutes, when you're feeling lonely."

Do you care for me less than you did before ?. Or don't you love me at all anymore ?. I need you baby, I just wanted you then. But I do love you now."
i never thought,"You know I never really thought some things would ever really come to be. 'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me. I went down in Mississippi, I asked Mister Charlie about my roots. He said, ""Turn around, bend over, boy, they're right here in my boots"". You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be. 'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me. I asked a policeman the time, he swung and crowned me with his stock. I managed to walk away so glad it weren't twelve o'clock. You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be. 'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me. My girl friend's datin' this here guy who's goin' out with some man's wife. I lost my girl, the wife her husband, the guy he lost his life.

She used to get her kicks just askin' me to flick my Bic. You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be. 'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me.

i'm just a name,"Hello, I'm just a fan who had to call you on the phone. Someone you won't remember of the many that you own. I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone. Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown. I know I'm only someone else in love with you in vain. I wish I could have helped myself, but love is so much pain. It makes me feel that there is still a chance that may remain. That you will someday surely come and give me love again. I knew your love would never be as deep as mine for you. And I knew that these many nights I'd be alone and blue. And lie awake while you forsake the only love I knew. And never learn that you'll return and we would live it through. Each time I dream a dream, I dream we're cuddled arm in arm. It seems you're looking straight at me, when I see you perform. Sometimes I think you see my face become so shy and warm. I often wonder if you know the power in your charms. Please, let me say I still love you before you hang the phone. And I am proud to once have shared the beauty that you own. I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone. Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown."

i've changed,"I have changed, nothing like I used to be. I have changed, darling, nothing like I used to be. When I cared so much for you, was love blinded and I couldn't see. I sat down a many evening with my mind in a total ruin. Wondering where on earth you were and what you might be doing. But I've changed, nothing like I used to be. When I cared so much for you was love blinded and I couldn't see. I have waited for you at morning, right behind a sleepless night. But now my eyes are wide open and I see you wasn't right. Yes, I've changed, nothing like I used to be. When I cared so much for you, I was love blinded and I couldn't see. If you still love me baby, you gonna have to come across. We will tear off together so there will be no loving lost. 'Cause I've changed, nothing like I used to be. When I cared so much for you, was love blinded and I couldn't see."
if i were,"If I were a pendulum swing and you were the bird in the cuckoo clock. Ev'ry time you cucko-cooed I would double tick another tick tock. I'd double my swing ev'ry time you'd sing we'd make good time with each other. Oh, but that would be just so much fun cooin' and swingin' together. If I were a little bitty boy and I had just a little bit o' credit. I would make a loan for an ice cream cone and I'd go right away and get it. You would lick a little and I would lick a little, we surely could lick with each other. Oh, but that would be just so much fun, eating it all together. And if I were a little honey bee and you were a little butterfly. I would be waiting at the garden gate until you came fluttering by. Maybe you'd stop on a red rose top and then we could talk to each other. Oh, but we cou'd flutter up so much fun being in the garden together. But I'm just an ordinary guy and I love all the things you do. You seem such a talented, beautiful girl and I'm afraid to even talk to you. If I were as bold like some guys, hearin' them talk to each other. I'd come over and ask you if we could go out together. But if you were a Mercedes-Benz, I'd have to be a Fleetwood Brougham. And ev'ry time I saw you rollin' on the freeway I think I'd have to follow you home. You could let me lodge in your double garage, bumper to bumper out of the weather. Nobody home but the Benz and the Brougham, really rarin' to roll off together."

it's my own business,"I am tired of you telling me what I ought to do. Stickin' your nose in my business and it don't concern you. It's my own business, it's my own business. Seems like the ones that want to tell you. They don't ever know as much as you. If I go buy a Cadillac convertible coupe. And all I got at home to eat is just onion soup. It's my own business, it's my own business. If I would rather ride around. In my own Cadillac convertible coupe. If I's a dignatary on Capitol Hill. And up and married me a waitress in a hot dog grill. It's my own business, it's my own business. Because I am not a juvenile. And I can go out at my own free wil. After workin' on my job and then drawin' my pay. If I want to go out and have a ball and throw it all away. It's my own business, it's my own business. 'Cause I don't wait until tomorrow. To do something I could do today."
it's too dark in here,"I went to pick this little girl up I met last night. She's ready, waitin' for me under the front porch light. She said, ""Ain't it dark out there, ooh, it's so dark out there. I hope your car got bright lights, ooh, it's so dark out there"". We went to a house party, it was really outta sight. It was about forty people dancin' under one dim light. ""Ain't it dark in there, ooh, it's too dark in there. Will you take me somewhere else, darlin', 'cause it's too dark in there"". So I drove her out the freeway into the country air. She said, ""I hope you ain't gonna park around here nowhere. It's too dark out there, so dark out there. Let's go back into town and do something 'cause it's too dark out there"". So I asked her just where she had in mind to go. She said, ""Maybe to a scary movie picture show"". I said, ""It's too dark in there"". I said, ""It's too dark in there. I've seen that movie before, baby, it's too dark in there"". So it was nothing left for me to do but take her back home. 'Twas no one there, the lights was out and the fuse was blown. And it was dark in there, yes, it was dark in there. And we finally got the fuse in. Ooh, it was dark in there."
jaguar and thunderbird,"Chorus: Slow down, little Jaguar. Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford. Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road. T'was a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford. Jaguar setting on ninety nine. Tryin' to beat the Bird to the county line. Just a half-a-mile from Ludenville. There had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill. It said : ""35 miles, and stay in line"". But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign. Chorus. Ludenville was a real small town. Had a hundred and two. And nine acres of ground. Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise. Told him ""Park down in Ludenville. And catch 'em guys"". Sheriff laid down, half hid in the weeds. Parked for eight days, didn't nobody speed. All of a sudden, dust rose on the road. Said ""Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford"". Chorus. Sheriff doubled clutched second, put it in third. Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird. He knew he'd get a bonus and a big fat fine. If he caught 'em 'fore they crossed that line. Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat. But if he aimed to get 'em. He'd have to do more than that. Crest of the hill, is about a mile behind. There wasn't but two mor miles to the county line. Chorus. Old Sheiff was countin' on the downward grade. With the tall wind pushin', he had it made. Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin' speed. And waved ""Goodbye, Jaguar"" and pulled in the lead. Jaguar said ""You ain't won the race yet"". And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet. Sheriff's front bumper was a yard behind. When the T-Bird, Jaguar crossed the line. Slow down little Jaguar,. Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford. (repeat and fade)."
jamaica farewell song,"Down the way where the nights are gay,. And the sun shines brightly on the mountaintop,. I took a trip on a sailing ship,. And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.. But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,. Won't be back for many a day,. My heart is down, my head is turning around,. I miss all my friends in Kingston town.. . Down at the market you can hear,. All the ladies cry out while on their heads they bear,. Akie rice, salt fish are nice,. And the sun is fine any time of the year.. . [CHORUS. But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,. Won't be back for many a day,. My heart is down, my head is turning around,. I miss all my friends in Kingston town.]. . Sounds of laughter everywhere,. And the children sway to and fro,. I must declare that my heart is there,. Though I've been from Maine to Mexico.. . [CHORUS (twice). But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,. Won't be back for many a day,. My heart is down, my head is turning around,. I miss all my friends in Kingston town.]. ."
jo jo gunne,"It was in ancient history, four thousand B.C.. Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree. Hanging on a branch up under the sun. Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne. Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain. To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain. Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' the jag. About the elephant who was gonna skin the lion. Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail. Got mad and went roarin' through the jungle trail. He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree. And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me. An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight. Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight. A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge. Coming all the way from India upon a local barge. Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den. But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins. Jo Jo yelled at Leo,?O:P> Go on, knock him down. He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds ?/O:P>. Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut. The elephant took a snoop, grabbed a coconut. Leo fired a beautiful short back cross. That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw. Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in. The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in. The buzzard said, they fought furious all day. He couldn't understand how Leo got away. Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news. To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos. A hoot owl reported everything he saw. Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw. Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised. Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues. Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down. Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground. Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat. Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet. Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes. Said, please mister Leo, I apologize. Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground. I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds. Leo got back to the square of the fight. Jo Jo took a leap and jumped... out of sight."
johnny b. goode,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans. Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,. There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood. Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode,. Who never ever learned to read or write so well. But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.. (Chorus). Go Go. Go Johnny Go Go (x4). Johnny B. Goode. He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,. Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track. Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,. Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,. People passin' by they would stop and say. ""Oh my but that little country boy can play"". (Chorus). His momma told him ""some day you will be a man,. And you will be the leader of a big ol' band. Many people comin' from miles around,. To hear you play your music till the sun go down,. Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin. 'Johnny B. Goode' tonight"". (Chorus)"

no particular place to go,"Ridin' along in my automobile. My baby beside me at the wheel. I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile. My curiosity runnin' wild. Cruisin' and playin' the radio. With no particular place to go.. Ridin' along in my automobile. I'm anxious to tell her the way I feel,. So I told her softly and sincere,. And she leaned and whispered in my ear. Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow,. With no particular place to go.. No particular place to go,. So we parked way out on the Kokomo. The night was young and the moon was bold. So we both decided to take a stroll. Can you imagine the way I felt?. I couldn't unfasten her safety belt!. Ridin' along in my calaboose. Still tryin' to get her belt aloose. All the way home I held a grudge,. For the safety belt that. wouldn't budge. Cruisin' and playin' the radio. With no particular place to go.."

I remember so well back when the weather was cool. We used to have so much fun when we were walking to school. If we stopped off to hear the latest songs that they sing. Sometimes we'd just make it in before the bell would ring. (*Repeat X 2). When the teacher was gone, that's when we had a ball. We used to dance and play all up and down the hall. We had a portable radio, we was ballin' the jacks. But we'd be all back in order when the teacher got back. (*Repeat)."

pass away,"(Recitation). Once in Persia reigned a king who upon his royal ring carved these words so true and wise. Which when held before his eyes gave him counsel at a glance of his life of changing chance. Solemn words and these are they: ""Even this shall pass away"". Trains of camels through the sand brought him gems from Samarkand. Fleets of galleys through the sea brought him pearls to match with thee. But he counted not his gain nor his treasure, mine or main. ""What is wealth ?"", the king would say, ""Even this shall pass away"". In the revel of his court, at the zenith of his sport. When the palms of all his guests burned with clapping at his zest. He among his figs and wine would cry, ""Oh, loving friends of mine. Pleasures may come, but they cannot stay, like even this shall pass away ?"". The most beautiful woman ever seen was the bride he chose his queen. Pillowed on their royal bed, whispering to her soul he said:. ""Though a bridegroom never pressed dearer bosom to his chest. But mortal flesh must come to clay and even these shall pass away"". Towering over the village square, thirty meters in the air. Rose his statue, carved in stone, as the king stood there alone. Gazing at his sculptured name, said to himself, ""So what is fame ?. Fame, it's but slow decay, even this shall pass away"". Fighting furiously on a battlefield, once a javelin pierced his shield. Soldiers with a loud lament bore him bleeding to his tent. Groaning from his tortured side, ""Pain is hard to bear"", he cried. ""Oh, but with patience day by day, even this shall pass away"". Sick and sore with cancer; weak and tired and old, just minutes yet to go to pass the gates o' gold. Spake he with his dying breath, ""Life is done, so what is death ?"". Then in answer to the king fell a sunbeam on his ring. Reflecting words he failed to say: ""Even this shall pass away""."
promised land,"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia,. California on my mind.. Straddled that Greyhound, rode him to Raleigh,. On across Caroline.. Stopped on Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill,. And we never was a minute late.. We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown,. Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.. We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,. Half way 'cross Alabama,. And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded. In downtown Birmingham.. Straight off, I bought me a through train ticket,. Ridin' cross Mississippi clean. And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham. Smoking into New Orleans.. Somebody help me get out of Louisiana. Just help me get to Houston town.. There's people there who care a little 'bout me. And they won't let the poor boy down.. Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit,. Put luggage in my hands,. And I woke up high over Albuquerque,. On a jet to the promised land."
rain eyes,"Rain eyes that blur the rays of sunshine. When all you see is seen through tears. The whole world seems as though it's crying. Rain eyes, that's how my world appears. One sunny day in Lou'siana. The clouds began to hover low. And darkness came in early evening. And brought a rain that would not go. I's just a child when mother told me. It seems your father's gone away. It's not his fault, my child, forgive him. I should have known he would not stay. You're so much like him and he loves you. But now his love's for only you. Although he forced himself to leave you. Forgiving me he could not do. Rain eyes that cloud the hope of sunshine. When everything is seen through tears. The whole world seems as though it's crying. Rain eyes, that's how my world appears. It rains all evening into nighttime. Then rains all night and through the day. My mother's eyes are weak from crying. Forgive her, she just lost her way. Since you've been gone her eyes have clouded. And darkness reigns her weary view. She'd see again from your returning. That God knows she's in love with you. One rainy day in Louisiana. The trade winds blew the clouds away. A mother heard her boy shout, ""Father"". My God, 'tis him, he's come to stay."

If I'm feeling tomorrow just like I feel today. I'm gonna pack my bags and make a getaway. St. Louis woman without your diamond ring. If you didn't have good looks, you wouldn't mean a thing. If it was not for powder and your super hair. Without the man who loves you, you wouldn't get nowhere ?nowhere. I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be.

sweet little rock 'n' roller,"Nineteen years old and as sweet as she could be.. All dressed up like a down-town Christmas tree.. Dancing and humming a rock’n’roll melody, ooh..

talking about my buddy,". . It was a group in automation getting together two by two. Where people live and love one another, people who live like me and you. Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school. Taught him the way to please a woman, made him concede the Golden Rule. He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do. So they began to come together as I will try to do with you. And there was one who was a virgin, never been touched by anyone. She was as pure as any angel, in fact she's called to be a nun. But it was all because my buddy just couldn't spoil a girl so true. And so he left her as he found her, like I may have to do with you. The girl he's got now, he's never left her, she was the first I thought he'd shun. Until I saw my buddy's eyes, when she came forth and bore his son. Since then he's known no other woman, I think his ramblin' days are through. They built a home up in the country, a life I'd love to build with you. Although you've never known my buddy and I am sure he don't know you. But you know the life he's living and all of the changes he's been through. Sweetheart, I'm talking about my buddy 'cause I don't want to wind up blue. I could be happy with you only 'cause I see all of them in you. Shortcut to part of Chuck Berry Lyrics.

tell you about my buddy,"I'm goin' tell you about my buddy. But I'm not goin' reveal his name. 'Cause it's his life to live and he's livin' it. Claim it to fame or a game of shame. To each his own let nim live it. But there are those who may not agree. But I goin' tell you about my buddy. Ev'ry thing like he told it to me. A woman's the most peculiar creature. And so few has missed his hand. And out of all the ones that he's been with. You know, not one wouldn't take him again. Before you really know a sensuous woman. You have to be with her when she's alone. She could say no and then want you to leave her. And call you right back home after you're gone. You never can tell until after you've tried her. And then you might still be way off the track. Because it's the red and the white and the yellow. Has exactly what's packed in the black. One was a co-ed from Pennsylvania. One from Toronto who dug him the most. One was a rich widow in Houston. And one was a freak from the western coast. One was a teacher out of Chicago. And one had plans to become a nun. And one was the last one I thought he'd cling to. But she was tahe one who gave him a son. So people, I'll tell you 'bout my buddy. And like I say, I just can't reveal his name. It's his life and he's gonna live it. Claim it to fame or game or shame. Claim it fame or game or shame. Just a game or fame or shame. Fame or game or shame. Fame or game or shame. Fame or game or shame. Claim it fame or game or shame."
the festival,"Havin' a nationwide festival for fourteen days and nights. Ah, there's fifty four bands on a river boat spot in the lights. Hundred of bands and tents all on the banks of the Ohio. Bandstands floatin' from Paducah to Cairo. Be over a million freaks there diggin' the sights. There's so many beautiful people there to love and cheer. Some of the greatest guitar playin' in the western hemisphere. Got the Who, the Band from across the north border Canned Heat. The Fifth Dimension, Creedence Clearwater. Oh, brother Hendrix, sister Joplin, we wish you were here. Early in the mornin' Johnny Cash and old Elvis got loose. The Who, Vanilla Fudge and the Woolies start paying their dues. All evening Ike Turner and Aretha right on the Drifters. And the Coasters and the Loading Zone. All night Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters in a battlin' mood. Oh, what a beautiful show, was sitting right up under the microphone. Diggin' the Grateful Dead, Little Richard and the Rolling Stones. Ray Charles, Led Zeppelin and the Everly Brothers. Bad Bo Diddley and the Beatles and some others. Everybody's laying back and freaking out all week long."

the love i lost,"After the sun goes down in the evening. That's when your leaving hurts me most. The times when you would nestle to me. And dwell within my heart so cold. Although you stand two steps away now. The distance seems from coast to coast. I often think of when I met you. Many times we kissed goodbye. Sometimes I dream we are together. Wake up moanin' your name thru sleepy eyes. And I wanna scream that I still love you. But you're not there, I got to realize. It is now High Noon in China. With the same stars up above. The one I need has left me and gone now. And all I have is a little picutre of. The truest one I've ever known now. Is the love I lost and still I love."
the man and the donkey,"The man and the donkey. Down the road came a tired little donkey,. Much he was loaded till his head hung down.. Upon this back so heavy set a big man,. Singinâ€™ such a sad song. As he rode into town.. And the man, the man sing to the donkey,. But he sing such a sad song, and the guitar he broke.. The donkey stop, the man he reach to get a big jug,. Him and the donkey take a sip oâ€™ the drink.. Down the road, oh the dancing donkey,. Head swinginâ€™ so high, all the pain now gone.. The man he sing, some song was a gay song,. And the little donkey kept a-dancinâ€™ on.. Down the road was the man and the donkey,. So good feel the donkey, so gay was the man.. How plain when the wind blow was the sound of the gay song,. When the man and the donkey kept a-movinâ€™ on down the road.."

Prayin' ain't no sure guarantee. Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me. He was streakin' through the Delta, stridin' wide. But that leadin' hound was meters from his hide. Lord, bless my feet, don't let 'em go corrupt. I'll lay 'em down as fast as you can pick 'em up. It wudn't me, it wudn't me. I'm so glad it wudn't me. Just meters from a canine jubilee. Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me. He reached a highway through the ticket on the side. And a trucker came along and let him ride. But as he settled down to thank him for no harm. He saw a swasti-KKK band on his arm. That's when he knew he had to get on help his self. 'Stead if sittin' pinnin' it on somebody else. He hung a left into that thicket 'cross the fence. And ain't nobody ever sawed or seen him since. It wudn't me, it wudn't me. I'm so glad it wudn't me. It ain't quite my kinda cup o'tea. Jeez, I'm glad it wudn't me. It wudn't me, it was not me. I'm so glad it wudn't me. It just ain't my kinda cup o'tea. Jeez, am I glad it wudn't me."
you and my country,"I love my country, it's aim and intent. I believe in the system as it is in print. But I'm in love with you. And determined to help amend it for you. It ain't my hearet to beg, rob or steal. Although sometimes that's just how I feel. 'Cause I do want you. To enjoy the few things that you love too. Working so hard for so little pay. And we just can live from day to day. This can't go on, it takes too long. Those days are gone. I know I'm nobody, I lost out in school. But I feel something wrong unless I'm a fool. I'm going to keep prying, at least I'll be trying. 'Cause somebody's lying."
you can't catch me,"I bought a brand new airmobile. It was custom made. It was a Flight DeVille. With an powerful motor. And some hideaway wings. Push in on the button and you can hear her sing. Now you can't catch me. No, baby, you can't catch me. 'Cause if you get too close. You know I'm gone like a cool breeze. New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours. I was rolling slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers. Up come a flattop he was movin' up with me. Then come wavin' goodbye. In a little old souped up mini. I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll. Moanin' sirens, for the state patrol. So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn. Bye-bye New Jersey I become airborne. Now you can't catch me. No, baby you can't catch me. 'Cause if you get too close. You know I'm gone like a cool breeze. Flyin' with my baby last Saturday night. Wasn't a gray cloud floatin' in sight. Big full moon shinin' up above. Cuddle up honey be my love. Sweetest little thing that I ever seen. I'm gonna name you Mabelline. Flyin' on the beam set on flight control. Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll. Two, three hours a-passin' by. Altitude dropped to 505. Fuel consumption way too fast. Let's get on home before we run out of gas. Now you can't catch me. No baby, you can't catch me. 'Cause if you get too close. You know I'm gone like a cool breeze."
you go to my head,"You go to my head. And you linger like a haunting refrain. And I find you spinning round in my brain. Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne. You go to my head. Like the sparkles in a burgundy brew. And I find the very mention of you. Is like the kicker in a julep or two. Oh what a thought that you might give a thought to my plea. Cast a spell over me. But then I say to myself, Ah! get hold to yourself, can't you see. It can never be. You go to my head. Like the summer with a thousand Julys. Oh how you make my temprature rise. You intoxicate ny soul with your eyes. You go to my head. With a smile that makes my temprature rise. It's like a summer with a thousand Julys. You intoxicate my soul with your eyes"
you never can tell,"It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well. You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle. And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell. They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale. The coolerator was crammed with Tv dinners and ginger ale,. But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell. They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast. Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz. But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell. They bought a souped-up jitney, 'twas a cherry red '53,. They drove it down to Orleans to celebrate the anniversary. It was there that Pierre was married to the lovely mademoiselle. ""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell. It had a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well. You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle. And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,.

you two,"Letâ€™s throw a twilight cookout,. We two, you two, no more;. â€˜Way out somewhere in the country,. Where weâ€™ve never been before.. Letâ€™s throw it on a weekend,. We two, you two, no more;. And lounge away a holiday,. Like weâ€™ve never done before.. Weâ€™ll bring the rounds and some jazzy sound,. To play by a cozy fire,. You two roast wieners and weâ€™ll toast the buns. And weâ€™ll chow till the night grows nighâ€™er.. Weâ€™ll call for you on the weekend,. We two, you two, no more;. And ride out somewhere in the country air,. Just a cozy clan of four.."
