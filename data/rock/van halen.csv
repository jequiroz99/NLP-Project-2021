dirty water dog,"(Words by Van Halen). No candidate would I support. His platform could I endorse. Another accomplice slinging dirt. Campaign promises falling short. I don't belong to any race. Pledge allegiance to a place. No borderline in the sand I'd trace. I'm just a sucker for a pretty face. Uncomfortable in the realm of the political. Position's always been a little left of cynical. I'm fundamentally for the individual. Preoccupied purely with the physical. When heavy is the weight of the world. And the river runs a little too deep. Like a hound dog chasing a bird. Sometimes a certain tom's gotta peep. I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls. And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see. I don't wanna find religion. Or another man's opinion. I Can't choose what's not my decision. When there's only one under the sun. There's no need to be denied. Chew before swallowing pride. I want to live so let me die. Oh by the way, what's your sign?. Can't comprehend the meaning of the metaphysical. I'd rather leave that to your so-called intellectual. But what I do know I know feels only natural. I'm just a red-blooded heterosexual. When heavy is the weight of the world. And the river runs a little too deep. Like a dirty water doggin' a bird. Sometimes a certain tom's he gotta peep. I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls. And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see. (Guitar Solo). When heavy is the weight of the world. And the river runs a little too deep. Like a dirty water doggin' a bird.
