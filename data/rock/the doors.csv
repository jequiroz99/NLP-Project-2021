the celebration of the lizard,"Lions in the street and roaming. Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming. A beast caged in the heart of a city. The body of his mother. Rotting in the summer ground. He fled the town. He went down South and crossed the border. Left the chaos and disorder. Back there over his shoulder. One morning he awoke in a green hotel. With a strange creature groaning beside him. Sweat oozed from its shiny skin. Is everybody in?. The ceremony is about to begin. Wake up!. You canâ€™t remember where it was. Had this dream stopped?. The snake was pale gold. Glazed and shrunken. We were afraid to touch it. The sheets were hot dead prisons. Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom. Look!. I canâ€™t live thru each slow century of her moving. I let my cheek slide down. The cool smooth tile. Feel the good cold stinging blood. The smooth hissing snakes of rain . .. Once I had, a little game. I liked to crawl back into my brain. I think you know the game I mean. I mean the game called â€˜go insane?. Now you should try this little game. Just close your eyes forget your name. Forget the world forget the people. And weâ€™ll erect a different steeple. This little game is fun to do. Just close your eyes no way to lose. And Iâ€™m right there Iâ€™m going too. Release control weâ€™re breaking thru. Way back deep into the brain. Back where thereâ€™s never any pain. And the rain falls gently on the town. And in the labyrinth of streams. Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of. Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around. Reptiles abounding. Fossils, caves, cool air heights. Each house repeats a mold. Windows rolled. Beast car locked in against morning. All now sleeping. Rugs silent, mirrors vacant. Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples. Wound in sheets. And daughters, smug. With semen eyes in their nipples. Wait. Thereâ€™s been a slaughter here. (Donâ€™t stop to speak or look around. Your gloves and fan are on the ground. Weâ€™re getting out of town. Weâ€™re going on the run. And youâ€™re the one I want to come). Not to touch the earth. Not to see the sun. Nothing left to do, but. Run, run, run. Letâ€™s run. House upon the hill. Moon is lying still. Shadows of the trees. Witnessing the wild breeze. Câ€™mon baby run with me. Letâ€™s run. Run with me. Run with me. Run with me. Letâ€™s run. The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill. Rich are the rooms and the comforts there. Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs. And you wonâ€™t know a thing till you get inside. Dead presidentâ€™s corpse in the driverâ€™s car. The engine runs on glue and tar. Câ€™mon along, weâ€™re not going very far. To the East to meet the Czar. Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake. The ministerâ€™s daughterâ€™s in love with the snake. Who lives in a well by the side of the road. Wake up, girl! Weâ€™re almost home. Sun, sun, sun. Burn, burn, burn. Soon, soon, soon. Moon, moon, moon. I will get you. Soon!. Soon!. Soon!. Let the carnival bells ring. Let the serpent sing. Let everything. We came down. The rivers and highways. We came down from. Forests and falls. We came down from. Carson and Springfield. We came down from. Phoenix enthralled. And I can tell you. The names of the Kingdom. I can tell you. The things that you know. Listening for a fistful of silence. Climbing valleys into the shade. â€˜I am the Lizard King. I can do anything. I can make the earth stop in its tracks. I made the blue cars go away. For seven years I dwelt. In the loose palace of exile. Playing strange games. With the girls of the island. Now I have come again. To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise. Brothers and sisters of the pale forest. O Children of Night. Who among you will run with the hunt?. Now Night arrives with her purple legion. Retire now to your tents and to your dreams. Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth. I want to be ready."

celebration of the lizard,"Lions in the street and roaming. Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming. A beast caged in the heart of a city. The body of his mother. Rotting in the summer ground. He fled the town. He went down South and crossed the border. Left the chaos and disorder. Back there over his shoulder. One morning he awoke in a green hotel. With a strange creature groaning beside him. Sweat oozed from its shiny skin. Is everybody in?. The ceremony is about to begin. Wake up!. You can't remember where it was. Had this dream stopped?. The snake was pale gold. Glazed and shrunken. We were afraid to touch it. The sheets were hot dead prisons. And she was beside me. Old, she's not, young. Her dark red hair. Her white soft skin. Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom. Look!. I can't live through each slow century of her moving. I let my cheek slide down. The cool smooth tile. Feel the good cold stinging blood. The smooth hissing snakes of rain . .. Once I had, a little game. I liked to crawl back into my brain. I think you know the game I mean. I mean the game called 'go insane'. Now you should try this little game. Just close your eyes forget your name. Forget the world forget the people. And we'll erect a different steeple. This little game is fun to do. Just close your eyes no way to lose. And I'm right there I'm going too. Release control we're breaking through. Way back deep into the brain. Back where there's never any pain. And the rain falls gently on the town. And over the heads of all of us. And in the labyrinth of streams. Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of. Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around. Reptiles abounding. Fossils, caves, cool air heights. Each house repeats a mold. Windows rolled. Beast car locked in against morning. All now sleeping. Rugs silent, mirrors vacant. Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples. Wound in sheets. And daughters, smug. With semen eyes in their nipples. Wait. There's been a slaughter here. (Don't stop to speak or look around. Your gloves and fan are on the ground. We're getting out of town. We're going on the run. And you're the one I want to come). Not to touch the earth. Not to see the sun. Nothing left to do, but. Run, run, run. Let's run. House upon the hill. Moon is lying still. Shadows of the trees. Witnessing the wild breeze. C'mon baby run with me. Let's run. Run with me. Run with me. Run with me. Let's run. The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill. Rich are the rooms and the comforts there. Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs. And you won't know a thing till you get inside. Dead president's corpse in the driver's car. The engine runs on glue and tar. C'mon along, we're not going very far. To the East to meet the Czar. Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake. The minister's daughter's in love with the snake. Who lives in a well by the side of the road. Wake up, girl! We're almost home. Sun, sun, sun. Burn, burn, burn. Soon, soon, soon. Moon, moon, moon. I will get you. Soon!. Soon!. Soon!. Let the carnival bells ring. Let the serpent sing. Let everything. We came down. The rivers and highways. We came down from. Forests and falls. We came down from. Carson and Springfield. We came down from. Phoenix enthralled. And I can tell you. The names of the Kingdom. I can tell you. The things that you know. Listening for a fistful of silence. Climbing valleys into the shade. 'I am the Lizard King. I can do anything. I can make the earth stop in its tracks. I made the blue cars go away. For seven years I dwelt. In the loose palace of exile. Playing strange games. With the girls of the island. Now I have come again. To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise. Brothers and sisters of the pale forest. O Children of Night. Who among you will run with the hunt?. Now Night arrives with her purple legion. Retire now to your tents and to your dreams.

A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon. Couples naked race down by it’s quiet side. And we laugh like soft, mad children. Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy.

Enter the hot dream. Come with us. Everything is broken up and dances."

She rode on to Christmas. She rode to the farm. She rode to Japan. And we entered a town. By this time the river. Had changed one degree. She asked for the people. To let her go free.

the celebration of the lizard,"Lions in the street and roaming. Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming. A beast caged in the heart of a city. The body of his mother. Rotting in the summer ground. He fled the town. He went down South and crossed the border. Left the chaos and disorder. Back there over his shoulder. One morning he awoke in a green hotel. With a strange creature groaning beside him. Sweat oozed from its shiny skin. Is everybody in?. The ceremony is about to begin. Wake up!. You canâ€™t remember where it was. Had this dream stopped?. The snake was pale gold. Glazed and shrunken. We were afraid to touch it. The sheets were hot dead prisons. Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom. Look!. I canâ€™t live thru each slow century of her moving. I let my cheek slide down. The cool smooth tile. Feel the good cold stinging blood. The smooth hissing snakes of rain . .. Once I had, a little game. I liked to crawl back into my brain. I think you know the game I mean. I mean the game called â€˜go insane?. Now you should try this little game. Just close your eyes forget your name. Forget the world forget the people. And weâ€™ll erect a different steeple. This little game is fun to do. Just close your eyes no way to lose. And Iâ€™m right there Iâ€™m going too. Release control weâ€™re breaking thru. Way back deep into the brain. Back where thereâ€™s never any pain. And the rain falls gently on the town. And in the labyrinth of streams. Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of. Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around. Reptiles abounding. Fossils, caves, cool air heights. Each house repeats a mold. Windows rolled. Beast car locked in against morning. All now sleeping. Rugs silent, mirrors vacant. Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples. Wound in sheets. And daughters, smug. With semen eyes in their nipples. Wait. Thereâ€™s been a slaughter here. (Donâ€™t stop to speak or look around. Your gloves and fan are on the ground. Weâ€™re getting out of town. Weâ€™re going on the run. And youâ€™re the one I want to come). Not to touch the earth. Not to see the sun. Nothing left to do, but. Run, run, run. Letâ€™s run. House upon the hill. Moon is lying still. Shadows of the trees. Witnessing the wild breeze. Câ€™mon baby run with me. Letâ€™s run. Run with me. Run with me. Run with me. Letâ€™s run. The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill. Rich are the rooms and the comforts there. Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs. And you wonâ€™t know a thing till you get inside.

Moon, moon, moon. I will get you. Soon!. Soon!. Soon!. Let the carnival bells ring. Let the serpent sing. Let everything. We came down. The rivers and highways. We came down from. Forests and falls. We came down from. Carson and Springfield. We came down from. Phoenix enthralled. And I can tell you. The names of the Kingdom. I can tell you. The things that you know. Listening for a fistful of silence. Climbing valleys into the shade. â€˜I am the Lizard King. I can do anything. I can make the earth stop in its tracks. I made the blue cars go away. For seven years I dwelt. In the loose palace of exile. Playing strange games. With the girls of the island. Now I have come again. To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise. Brothers and sisters of the pale forest. O Children of Night. Who among you will run with the hunt?. Now Night arrives with her purple legion. Retire now to your tents and to your dreams. Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth. I want to be ready."

And perfect our lives.. We need great golden copulations,. When the true kings murders. Are allowed to roam free,. A thousand magicians arise in the land. Where are the feast we are promised?.

Each house repeats a mold. Windows rolled. A beast car locked in against morning.. All now sleeping. Rugs silent, mirrors vacant,. Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples. Wound in sheets.. And daughters, smug. With semen eyes in their nipples. Wait. There's been a slaughter here!."
