happiness,Don't know what I want to do. My laziness'll see me through. Happiness is all I need. The truth is never guaranteed. I'll let my state of mind content me.

my uptight life,The morning sun opens up my eyes. What I see is the same world I know you're seeing. My dreams are real until I realise. Realising's a slow fade from thought to being. The waking world is full of cynics' sighs. Cynicism's a box I don't want to be in. I'll stay in bed until I stabilize. I try to write this song. To move my life along. I know what I dream of. I'll save my life for love. Hidden meanings don't need to hide. When I hide from the world you're the one who'll find me. They don't need screening from the world outside. If the truth's overdue I know you'll remind me. If the truth police are sniffing out a lie. I've done nothing in life I can't put behind me. I'll use my life as an alibi. Meaning is something I got from you. Whenever I lost the plot you knew. What is it I haven't got. When I've got you. Meaning is something I got from you. Whenever I lost the plot you knew. What is it I haven't got. When I've got you. All my life I felt so uptight. Now it's all right.. [repeat to fade]

empty space,Standing motionless beneath the sun. The lights won't change and the engine burns. Beyond there lies a steady pace. That's where i look to. Eye on the clock. And tomorrow nears. Do I patiently wait. Thrugh the passing years?. Every day is like empty space. Freedom lied. It haunts this place. Although the signs say less is more. I still hope for your fair rays of light. Upon my door. Thrugh the confines of the city scape. I can see the future taking shape. Watching aircraft span the evening sky. Like rivers flowing. Making turns for open roads. I've been lost in the spin. Don't know where to begin. Every day is like empty space. Freedom lied. It haunts this place. Although the signs say less is more. I still hope for your fair rays of light. Upon my door. I still hope for your fair radiant light. Enviado por: Makson Côra

fallen leaves,"Fallen leaves on the overground. Riding the blue train's empty line all around. On the evening run, I say you're the only one. All around the golden low sinking bright of the sun. See a simple spark. Bleed a burning flame. It seems so now. Everything's so near. Oh, come on over. The future's here. So brighten up. There is more to become. Fasten down every day. Cos nothing's tied, nothing stays. And I need a driving life. Cos the static weight draws too much useless dust. It gather up, it blocks the way. Watch the landing lights. On a passing plane. It seems so now. Everything's so near. Oh, come on over. The future's here"

And he wants to let you know, that if he had his chance again. He'd be a diamond. When you dab your eyes, your tears keep on falling. When you blow your nose, it still gets blocked up and runs. And though you feel like shit, he says you look beautiful. And he swears by all the saints, that if he had his chance again. He'd be a diamond. Is he lying to get what he wants. Or does he mean it this time. Is he running low on affection. And beer and dope dope, and an ironing board. And an unpaid analyst who shags. When you turn your back, you still see what's behind you. When you start afresh, you still think of days gone by. When a heart is broken, it still goes on pumping. And he told me just last night, that if he had his chance again."

live with the seasons,Clouds in the sky. Reflecting the sea. They mirror my life. And they disappear. Breathing the air. Got nowhere to be. I get my life. From the atmosphere. I wander the earth. But now I've come back here. To live with the seasons. And to be with you. I've pondered the worth. Of our life's of this sphere. But I don't need reasons. When I'm here with you. Distracted by life. Don't know what to be. But infinite feelings. Never disappear. Rain on my face. Pulled up from the sea. There's an ocean of meaning. And a lovers tear. The wind and snow and rain. Make me feel you. I wander the earth. But now I've come back here. To live with the seasons. And to be with you. I've pondered the worth. Of our life's of this sphere. But I don't need reasons. When I'm here with you. I'll live without reasons. When I'm here with you
long hair,(Love). I believe in everything I see. Why believe in everything you hear?. Everyday I pray. That this fear just slips away. And I'm holding all these memories of you.

As the days grow old. And I'm bound to feeling cold.

Fizzin' inside my head. All my senses wash away these booze that I've been fed. And if I could ask you how you feel. Would you reply or produce a shield?. Out on the street. Dead on my feet. Oh my love. That wine was the best girl I ever had.

mellow doubt,"It gives me pain, when I think of you. And the things together that we'll never do. At first it's cold, and then it's hot. Tried to be someone that I know I'm not. I'm in trouble, and I know it. How I'm feeling, I can't show it. But these feelings, don't go away. I remember you, lines on your face.. Sharing a moment in the perfect place.. I'm deep in your eyes, and inside your head.. And I try to reach you, when I'm in my bed.. I'm in trouble, and I know it. How I'm feeling, I can't show it. But these feelings, don't go away.

middle of the road,Raymond McGinley. A lot depends on life. And how much you've known it. I've got friends who like to think. That they've outgrown it. But time just sends it back.

mount everest,In the highest mountain. In the only fountain. In the Russian river. With you. Heard a million singing. For a new bell ringing. Set a world in motion. With you. There's a new generation. They've been sleeping all day. Long ago when tomorrow is. So the flow don't freeze up on this. Hope you know that tomorrow is. Still above you. Everybody's chasing. Everybody's facing. Everyone's in motion. With you. If you're chasing the morning. If you're sleeping all day. Long ago when tomorrow is. So the flow don't freeze up on this. Hope you know that tomorrow is. Still above you
mr. tambourine man,"(Bob Dylan). Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to. Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you. Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand. Vanished from my hand. Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping. My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet. I have no one to meet. And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming. . Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to. Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you. Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship. My senses have been stripped. My hands can't feel to grip. My toes too numb to step. Wait only for my bootheels to be wandering. I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade. Into my own parade. Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it. Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to. Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you. Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun. It's not aimed at anyone. It's just escaping on the run. And but for the sky there are no fences facing. And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme. To your tambourine in time. It's just a ragged clown behind. I wouldn't pay it any mind. It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing. . Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to. Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you. Take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind. Down the foggy ruins of time. Far past the frozen leaves. The haunted frightened trees. Out to the windy bench. Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow. Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free. Silhouetted by the sea. Circled by the circus sands. With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves. Let me forget about today until tomorrow. . Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to. Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me."

my uptight life,The morning sun opens up my eyes. What I see is the same world I know you're seeing. My dreams are real until I realise. Realising's a slow fade from thought to being. The waking world is full of cynics' sighs. Cynicism's a box I don't want to be in. I'll stay in bed until I stabilize. I try to write this song. To move my life along. I know what I dream of. I'll save my life for love. Hidden meanings don't need to hide. When I hide from the world you're the one who'll find me. They don't need screening from the world outside. If the truth's overdue I know you'll remind me. If the truth police are sniffing out a lie. I've done nothing in life I can't put behind me. I'll use my life as an alibi. Meaning is something I got from you. Whenever I lost the plot you knew. What is it I haven't got. When I've got you. Meaning is something I got from you. Whenever I lost the plot you knew. What is it I haven't got. When I've got you. All my life I felt so uptight. Now it's all right.. [repeat to fade]
near you,I should get out of this seat. feel the world beneath my feet. strive to see more of the sun. try to change what I've become. Move on up through this down. take this luck and turn it around. I get near you but I never seem to reach you. Somewhere tonight the stars still shine. somehow I've got to re-align. fuelled by the promise of the sun. pulled by the charm this night has spun. Move on up through this down. take this luck and turn it around. I get near you but I never seem to reach you

Became depressed for you. You were changing. Didn't want to stay the same. Re-arranging. Dropped a letter from your name. She'd get uptight with you. Would fight with you. And you would never win. It wasn't right for you. Was going nowhere. Couldn't take the pain and left it there. Was going nowhere. Couldn't take the pain and left it there. Not understanding. Had a different point of view.

I feel the planets surround me. They gather round me. I feel the planets surround me. They gather round me

sometimes i don't need to believe in anything,Drifting back through blossom streets. The silent me to loud. The cooling towers(?) and the mysteries. The gloaming lights tonight. Deep inside you never let go. Deep inside you never let this go. Taking a ride on a subway train. To feel more alive when you get back out again. And if you meet those eyes you feel all is known. Under a summer sky there's a gentle wind is blowing. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything. Heading west towards the glowing evening sunset. On an august night. Waking up before the mist is fully lifted. In the morning light. You feel the sadness in her eyes. As the autumn wind and golden leaves starts singing. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything. Sometimes I don't need to believe in anything

And you won't leave your mark on me. I'm protected by an honesty. And all the dead people in the world. too late, to live. And you won't leave your mark on me. You won't leave your mark on me.

sparky's dream,"If she lived in space, man. I'd build a plane. Out of luck so beam me up. To hear her talking again. She painted pictures. That never dried. Always tried to keep the feeling alive. Need a crystal ball to see her in the morning. And magic eyes to read between the lines.. I took a wrong direction. From a shooting star. In the love dimension. Fading fast from taking this too far. That summer feeling is gonna fly. Always try and keep the feeling inside. Need a crystal ball to see her in the morning. And magic eyes to read between the lines. I took a wrong direction.

sweet days waiting,"Storm clouds in the harbour. Dark waves have been drawing you in. This big old world's getting harder. Waiting for the troubled days to end.

Sometimes it's hard to know what's going on. 'Round to the light is declining. But somewhere beyond the horizon. Sweet, sweet days are waiting there for you. Sweet, sweet days are waiting there for you. There are sweet, sweet days waiting there for you. There are sweet, sweet days waiting there for you. Sweet, sweet days waiting there for you. There will be sweet, sweet days waiting there for you"
take the long way round,Sunshine every beat when I'm around you. Feels like maybe I've been here before. Through the cold days of learning. To the soul days of yearning. Take the long way around. Take the long way around. You know when you need it. Heart begins to clear. Tell me when you've seen it. She goes any way the lights are going. She knows there's no meaning to defend. Pull the subway to the station. For that golden lights sensation. Take the long way around. Take the long way around. You know when you need it. Heart begins to clear. Tell me when you've seen it. Sometimes you underline destinations. Sometimes you try to find inspiration. Take the long way around. Take the long way around. Take the long way around
tears,There's no future so don't fake it. Don't know if you're going to make it. When everything becomes unclear. You're tired and you're broken. You're true feelings remain unspoken. You couldn't hide behind your name. You're excited and ecstatic. You're exit was so dramatic. When all your passion disappeared. You're no sucker so don't blow it. You're succeeding but you don't know it. You've got to turn yourself around
tears are cool,I wanna talk to you don't want something that. I get for nothing I wanna talk to you. I know when something isn't worth discussing. You might say I know but you always knew. I could be unkind but I can't be cruel. All my lies are false but your heart is true. When I see you cry I think tears are cool. I wanna talk to you I don't wanna lover. that I take for granted I wanna talk to you. I wanna say something that you'll find romantic. [Chorus]. I don't say my prayers but I pray for you. I might say who cares but I know you do. You're the one who knows that my lies aren't true. When I see you cry I think tears are cool. [repeat Chorus 1x (drums enter)]
that's all i need to know,"(McGinley). Long ago, I used to grow. But stops when I got bored. But all along, the cynic song. Is something I ignored. It's your love, I dream of. And that's all I need to know. If I've got what you've not. The world says galot (?). But I've got what we've got. So I don't want to know. It's your love, I dream of. And it's all I need to know. Ah, ah, ah.... It's your love, I dream of. And that's all I need to know. It's your love, I dream of. And that's all I need to know. It's your love, I dream of. And that's all I need to know. It's your love, I dream of."
the back of my mind,She's in the mountains looking for a melody. She says there's music living in the breeze. You just can't look beyond the horizon. She is a diamond waiting to be ?free?. She calls to me. Sweet memory. She calls to me from the back of my mind. She is a stream that's searching for a river. She is the sunlight taken by the ??. She doesn't know what's dead or living. She's like a diamond waiting to be ?free?. She calls to me. Sweet memory. She calls to me from the back of my mind. She is a river searching for an ocean. She says there's magic hidden in the ?truth?. She doesn't if she's dead or living. She is a diamond waiting to be free. She calls to me. Sweet memory. She calls to me from the back of my mind
the ballad of john and yoko,"(Lennon/McCartney). Standing in the dock at Southampton, trying to get to Holland Or France. The man in the mac said, ""you've got to go back,"". you know they didn't even give us a chance. Christ!. You know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be. The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me.. Finally made the plane into Paris, honeymooning down by the Seine.. Peter Brown called to say, ""you can make it O.K.,. You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain."". Christ!. You know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be. The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me.. Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton, talking in our beds for a week.. The newspeople said, ""say what you doing in bed?"". I said ""we're only trying to get us some peace."". Christ!. You know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be. The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me.. Saving up your money for a rainy day,. Giving all your clothes to charity,. Last night the wife said,. ""Oh boy, when you're dead you don't take nothing with your soul"". Think!. Made a lightning trip to Vienna, eating chocolate cake in a bag.. The newspapers said, ""she's going to his head,"". They look like two Gurus in drag."". Christ!. You know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be. The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me.. Caught the early plane back to London, fifty acorns tied in a sack.. The men from the press said, ""we wish you success,. It's good to have the both of you back."". Christ!. You know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be. The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me.."
the cabbage,"Goodbye girl. Where did you go?. Woke up this morning. and I didn't know. We were together. but now we're not. Asked you for nothing. that's what I got. It's okay, even better this way. That's what they'll tell you. That's what they'll say. Are we together?. I guess we're not. Do you still want me?. that's what I thought. Look in the mirror. and I'm a mess. Open the window. forget about the rest. It's okay, even better this way. That's what they'll tell you. That's what they'll say. It's okay, even better this way. That's what they'll tell you.

the count,"Raymond McGinley. I thought since I was seven. That why means more than how. I don't believe in heaven. My life is right now. Come put your arms around me. I can't count the times you've found me. I see you across the table. You see my eyes of blue. Your eyes are always able. To see what I need. Come put your arms around me. I can't count the times you've found me. Where I go, you go. Within me without you. And I can't find a reason. Within me to doubt you. Come put your arms around me. I can't count the times you've found me. [REPEAT TO FADE]."
the fall,I fell into another world. I tried to discover what I was. I fell into my lovers arms. and I tried to recover what I'd lost. I'll miss part of the day. I feel the feelings I've lost. Crossing lines I'd never thought I'd cross. To uncover new ways. I turn my back on the city sights. And I climb into the mountains to see the stars. My eyes fixed time on those ancient lights. Like gravity makes fountains what they are. I'll miss part of the day. I feel the feelings I've lost. Spend my time and never count the cost. Crossing lines I'd never thought I'd cross. To uncover a new way. A new way. The leaves on the trees shield my eyes from the sun. But the leaves that I see they won't be there for long. When I light a fire underneath what I was. I won't feel sad only warmed by the loss
the past,Rolling through the city sprawl. On a late night train. The moon will survive us all. Waiting for a friend to call. I'm adrift again. I search for nothing at all. Modern life corrodes us all. You know that it's true. Give yourself a wake-up call. Let the past come back to rescue you. Seduced by a friendly fire. I just watch the window. Machines couldn't take me higher. Don't wanna to be a lonely liar. With a living tombstone. Your warmth fills my desire. Modern life corrodes us all. You know that it's true. Give yourself a wake-up call. Let the past come back to rescue you. I wake up to the morning star. Embraced by false phosphorescence. My dreams stay where they are. I don't know where to start. Alone and lost and guessing. Revealed by an open heart. Modern life corrodes us all. You know that it's true. Give yourself a wake-up call. You know what it'll do. Memory detains it all. Your know that it's true. Give yourself a wake-up call. Let the past come back to rescue you. The past come back to rescue you. The past come back to rescue you. The past comes back to rescue you
the shadows,(Blake). There was a shadow over you. You said you couldn't see it through. And there were demons in your head. They tried to tell you you were dead.. That's when I stepped into the ?. It's never have to be the same. I think we're going to be okay.
the sun shines from you,"Even when the world is grey. I go where I wanna go, I'm OK. Rainy skies don't cloud my mind. I do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do. I don't know anything but I. say what I wanna say, say what I wanna say. Know that I want you. The sky in my mind is always blue. In my world the sun shines from you. Often I know I don't see. The waves of love that wash over me. Your love is a paradigm. For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme. Visualizing paradise is a. thing I don't wanna do, a thing I don't wanna do. But I know that I want you. The sky in my mind is always blue. In my world the sun shines from you. Life traces the line in space between. What's gone and what's gonna be. Time chases me, my mind races. To find the place where I wanna be. The sky in my mind is always blue. In my world the sun shines from you. Know that I want you. Know that I want you (end)"
the town and the city,"Feels good to be here again. in the cool air and the driving rain. in the first light that morning brings. high five to future things. Chance is waiting just outside the door. arrange the space ??se change is heading here for sure. if you can't see it right away. you've got to listen, you've got to listen. don't just walk away. listen for what you're missing. because this light feels alright. The high-rise in the setting sun. progress that has just begun. the new life that tomorrow brings. high five to future things. Motion stopped the wheels from turning round. silence called but I've been tangled up in sound. if you can't hear it right away. you've got to listen, you've got to listen. don't just walk away. listen for what you'ree missing. because this light feels alright"
the world'll be ok,"I talk to you by satellite. I hope before they reach you,space will make the words sound right. I hear your voice come out the phone. I'd like both ears to hear you speak when I'm not on my own. And I forget that I'm not set in stone. I don't know where to draw the line. The flat horizon stretches out between your world and mine. And where I go will follow no design. When I feel like the world is lonely. You can heal me when you say. That you know the world'll be Ok. My jaded sense taste the view. The city eye pollutes you,makes you yearn for something new. I waste my time with magazine. The pages live life for you when your needs don't match your means. But your cares will suppress my selfish genes.. When I feel like the world is lonely. You can heal me when you say. That you know the world'll be Ok. The words we say won't go away. The meaning hides inside them,tries to look the other way. And I'll forget the words I meant to say. When I feel like the world is lonely. You can heal me when you say. That you know the world'll be Ok. I know the world'll be Ok. I know the world'll be Ok. I know the world'll be Ok...... . Enviado por: Makson Côra"
thin air,"There's a light, when my baby's in my arms. There's a light, when the window shades are drawn. Hesitate, when I feel I may do harm to her. Watch it all, cause this feeling we can share. And I know she's reached my heart, in thin air. Byzantine is reflected in our pond. There's a cloud, but the water remains calm. Reaching in, the suns fingers clutch the dawn to pass. Even out, it's a precious thing to bear. And I know she's reached my heart, in thin air. Yes I know she's reached my heart, in thin air. It's not in my past to presume. Love can keep on moving in both directions. How to be happy and true. Is the quest we're taking on together. Taking on, on, on, on. Taking on, on, on, on, on, on. There's a light, when my baby's in my arms. And I know she's reached my heart in thin air. And I know she's reached my heart in thin air. Yes I know she's reached my heart in thin air. Yes I know she's reached my heart"
time stops,"""Time Stops"". a distant bell that won’t stop ringing. the long night won’t defeat my soul. every day I hear sweet hearts singing. hold on ‘til I reach that goal. are the precepts by which I stand. set in stone, solid rock, or just sand?. there is more to learn than I aim for. so much under the sun I should play for. before I’m taken in. before I’m taken in. time stops when you find that feeling. you’re right back where it once begun. watching the distances disappearing. ice blocks in the mid-day sun. need a new line. a different plan. got the whole of the day in my hands. there is more to learn than I aim for. so much under the sun I should play for. there is more to learn.

today never ends,The sunlight pours in through my windows. I travel back in time. The past's a place where chaos stays indoors. The time you borrowed arise tomorrow. Today's the day that never ends.

Winter was underground. There are worlds. We can find. A hidden place. Is in our mind. Place where the water falls. Nobody ever calls. Sky is forever clear. Road never made it here. Forests are deep and green. Like nothing we've ever seen. Heavens revolving sin. Seasons change everything. There are worlds. We can find. A hidden place. Is in our mind. There are worlds. We can find. A hidden place. Is in our mind. There are worlds. We can find. A hidden place. Is in our mind
