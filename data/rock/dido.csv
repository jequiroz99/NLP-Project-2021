I missed the bus and there'll be hell today. I'm late for work again. And even if I'm there, they'll all imply. That I might not last the day. And then you call me and it's not so bad.

let us move on (feat. kendrick lamar),"Don't wrap it up and go. Or hide it behind the sun. Just give it to me as it is. And let it stand. And fly it like a kite. Between the clouds. It needs no excuse, just bring it down. Let us that are in in pain look upon it. In all its glory. Let us move on. Let us move on. This is short. And it will pass. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. Every voice that is lifted. River and some pain. Show us now. And let love not be chained. We should feel what we can stop. Let us be alive, show enough. And we've done all we can. Let us that are frozen. Get to see. In all its glory. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. And let all that is lost be forgotten. And it will pass. So let all that is lost be forgotten. Let us move on. [Kendrick Lamar]. Like the waters in the open sea. When tribulations come. All we can say is hopefully. And yesterday you could probably say. There's no hope for me. But today I'm overly dedicated, I'm 'posed to be. A testimony for broken hearts in the city. You either crash landing or planning on flying with me. Misery loves standing behind its company, well. Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell. On our past encounters, reaching over the counter. Told me that it's a appealing to pop a pill. That's a downer. I heard emotions burn deep. I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep. I heard when you see a thug. That's what you tryna be. Got these burdens under my wings. But I'm still free. Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away. Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass.

day before we went to war,All the pictures on the wall. The sand lying on the floor. The bed upstairs still unmade. The dust float in the light. The people just left. All laughter and mess. Forgetting this and that. And rushing back. The front door open. The music still playing in one room. Down the hall. Towels on the floor. And then it's quiet. Just the bees and birds. The summer haze. Of the trees. And the air. Feeds it all. Feeds it all. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. The day before we went to war. The day before we went to war. We can all feel it. All the parasols and kids at play. The sea so still and calm. Blue as the cloudless sky. Just the gentle hum. Of the summer's goings on. Broken by the sudden rush. Of two planes. Flying low and fast. Into the sun. Into the sun. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. We can all feel it. Like a light hand on your back. Welcoming you. The day before we went to war. The day before we went to war. We can all feel it. We can all feel it.

afraid to sleep,"We slept in this room together. But now you're gone. It's so quiet, I'll turn the tv on. We lived in this room together. We painted the walls. Now time doesn't stand still -- it crawls. And I'm afraid to sleep. Cause if I do I'll dream of you. And the dreams are always deep. On the pillow where I'll weep. I never realized how much I was in love with you. Till you started sleeping with someone new. Last night I dreamed again, and you were there. You kissed my face; you touched my hair. And I'm afraid to sleep. Cause if I do I'll dream of you. And the dreams are always deep. On the pillow where I'll weep. Lyin' alone in the darkness. With a memory in my head. There's a big hole where my heart is. And a lonlely feeling rolling 'round my bed. And I'm afraid to sleep. Cause if I do I'll dream of you. And dreams are always deep. On the pillow where I'll weep. On the pillow where I'll weep. I'm afraid to sleep"
all i see (feat. pete miser),"I thought it was done when I packed my bags and walked into the light. I picked the books I thought I should and closed the door behind. And when I handed back the keys I thought that I was free. No shame, no dirt, no surprises wait for me. I want to believe that where I began is not where I'll always be. But you're all I see and I carry you with me. You're all I see and I carry you with me. Thought it was safe to assume once I locked up the room. That I'd be gone for good but I would be back soon. Memories burned out still I'm smelling the fumes. Melodies turned down still I'm singing the tunes. Like a witch on a broom I wish I could fly fly away. Disappear into the ether find a hideaway. But the memories invade when I lie awake. Can't hide from yourself is what I'm trying to say. And by the way what would I be without my past. Only find the right number when I doubt my math. Avoid blunders only after I recount my last. Setbacks that don't kill me just amount to laughs. Anyway if I could turn back the hands of time. Would I change the events or change my mind. Wouldn't recognise myself without my doubts and fears. Got a feeling all I need is all right here. And you're all I see and I carry you with me. You're all I see and I carry you with me. I've been told apples don't fall far from the tree. I hope they're wrong when they're talking about me. All I see are the ruins of a plan gone wrong. All I need is a reason to keep on and stay strong. Gotta couple old ghosts that won't leave me alone. Even after moving three thousand miles from home. Thought I shook 'em when I hit Brooklyn wasn't even looking. But they're putting their mark on everything I do. Find a few quiet moments and they creep back through. Infiltrated my dreams and held my sleep back too. I don't know where I could go without them following me. It seems everywhere I look they're all I see. You're all I need. You're all I need. And you're all I see and I carry you with me. You're all I see and I carry you with me"
all you want,"I'd like to watch you sleep at night --. to hear you breathe by my side. And although sleep leaves me behind. there's nowhere I'd rather be. And now our bed is oh so cold. My hands feel empty, no one to hold. And I can sleep what side I want. It's not the same with you gone. Oh if you'd come home. I'll let you know that. All you want is right here in this room. All you want. And all you need is sitting here with you. All you want. It's been three years, one night apart. but in that night, you tore my heart. If only you had slept alone --. if those seeds had not been sown. Oh, you could come home. and you would know that. All you want is right here in this room. All you want. And all you need is sitting here with you. All you want. I hear your key turning in the door. I won't be hearing that sound anymore. And you and your sin. can leave the way you just came in. Send my regards to her. I hope you find that. All you want is right there in that room. All you want. And all you need is sitting there with you. All you want. I'd like to watch you sleep at night --. to hear you breathe by my side."
blackbird,"He put the coffee in the cup and with milk he filled it up. He added sugar and I never knew he liked it like that. He took his coat from the hook and his scarf and his hat. And he put down a key and said I won't be needing that. And he turned and smiled as if that explained it all. And he walked down the hall and he opened the door. And said, 'Of course, I'll call'. Heart, why do I bring you love. When all you give me back is pain. Heart, why do we search it out. To watch you wash your hands and walk away. Now there's a black black black bird in my chest. All a flutter and all caged in. Wanting to break free with the wolves in my head. Who tear at every wise thing I should have said. Heart, why do I bring you love. When all you give me back is pain. Heart, why do we search it out. To watch you wash your hands and walk away. We're not the strangers we were. When we first met. But the kind of strangers at the end. And all that remains is a day without plans. Where I won't be missed, another handful of sand. x2. Heart, why do I bring you love. When all you give me back is pain. Heart, why do we search it out. To watch you wash your hands and walk away"

christmas day,A young gentleman came riding past. On a snow blue winters day. He asked to drink by our fire. And I was pleased to let him stay. He drank there quietly for a while. And then he turned and said to me. Your eyes are green. Like summer grass. Your lips are red. Like a fresh cut rose. Your hair is soft. Like an Irish stream. And your voice. Is filled with sweet beauty. And the last words I heard him say. Were I shall return. For you. My love. On Christmas Day. And the night will come. But I won't sleep. As I watch the stars that lead him. I cannot place where he is. But still my heart goes with him. I'm saving all my Sunday clothes. For the day that I'll be leaving. Father knows. My sister knows. And my friends. They're happy for me. And the priest he says. You should thank God. For the blessing. Of such beauty. And the last words. I heard him say. Were I shall return. For you. My love. On Christmas Day. I shall return. For you. My love. On Christmas Day. (On Christmas Day). (I shall return for you my love). And the last words. I heard him say. Were the last words. I ever.

coming home,"He feels her smile when he's afraid --. it reminds him of his life before she went away. He might crumble, but he'll not fall. if the memory of his only love can stay that way.

I know what it's like. To be passed over. To go unnoticed. To be clumsy get things wrong. and I know what it's like. To arrive too late. To be told to leave. To be walked upon. If only for today. I wanna be the girl who got away. The lover who really loved. The dancer who danced. To the last song"

go dreaming,"Another summer coming to an end. And I'm still walking on with every care. And even if the birds have flown, the sun has gone. I'll still be here. Here. I wanna walk with kings. And take a chance on things. And know I may give way. To those who can cause me pain. And step aside to threats and bullies. I still believe, I still believe. Chorus. I rather go dreaming. Than leaving in something better than in me. I rather die loving than lost in the feeling. Of letting go. I rather die caring and working for something. Seeing is good. I can let it go. I can let it go. There are flying flags. And making noise. Bringing on their speeches. Dreams and boys. But when they're gone. I'll be standing here. And picking up the mess they left. I still believe. I still believe"

I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep. I heard when you see a thug. That's what you tryna be. Got these burdens under my wings. But I'm still free. Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away. Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass. Let us move on. Let us move on. For this is short. And it will pass.

Among your clothes. Among your noise and fuss. I've let it go. I can stop and catch my breath. And look no further, for happiness. I will not turn again. Cause my heart has found its home"
lost,"However long I'm under makes no difference. However long I'm down there'll be air for me. All I've had that's lost, that's gone it falls away. And I'll come up in my time, there'll be no fear for me. I walk down this easy path where shadows fall behind. And rest beneath the trees and wait for me. Lost's where I belong, lost's where I've gone. Lost is my new home, lost's where I belong. Usually darkness gets to me, this place is mine. No idea what led me to more peace than home. Dressed in blue she takes me through, no doubt for me. To follow right behind the sun is blind and I can't see. Lost's where I belong, lost's where I've gone. Lost is my new home, lost's where I belong. Lost's where I belong, lost where I've gone. Lost is my new home, lost's where I belong. I can walk, with no end, nothing hurts, nothing's pain. Nothing's missed, no one's gone, moved away, nothing's wrong.. Lost where I belong, lost where I've gone. Lost is where I belong"
love to blame,"Helen of Troy was the kind of girl. Who really had it all. Not a care in the world but her head was turned. And forever changed. She said one love is lost but another is found. So just take the keys and let's just go, birds fly south. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. It's all about love. So I'm not to blame. I'm not to blame. She said I've dotted my i's and I've crossed my t's. Had time for friends when they needed me. I try to make sense of senseless things. Try to live how I believe. And of course I leave things behind that I'll regret. But there's time enough for new things. yet, for new things yet. When the dust covers the sun. And all you hope for is undone. Will you turn and say. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. It was all for love so love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. When the dust covers the sun. And all you hope for is undone. Will you turn and say. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. It was all for love so love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame"
loveless hearts,"I can find the good news in anything. But without you, that's all gone. No one could have told me how much I'd miss you. And how soon the world moves on. How can they not hear me. When I say. Oh, we're not safe anymore. Did loveless hearts build the world. Only to tear it apart. How did those gods tempt you to leave. Just when we needed you most. The sun will rise today as it did yesterday. And I'll keep on going too. But every hour that I get through it breaks my heart. That I am losing more of you. Did loveless hearts build the world. Only to tear it apart. How did those gods tempt you to leave. Just when we needed you most. [x2]"
mary's in india,"Danny is lonely ''cause. Mary's in india now. She said she'd call but that was three weeks ago. She left all her things. Well, her books and her letters from him. As the sun rises on mary,. It sets on him. And just dance, and just drink. And just see the things. I'll probably never get the chance to see. Danny's not eating,. He's drinking and sleeping in.

me,"ME. by Dido. I've never had a filling and I've got blue eyes. I've got every kind of lipstick you can buy. I've got 3 cupboards for my shoes. And a mirror that always tells the truth. I've got clothes in case it's hot, clothes for when it's cold. But still I don't know what to wear, what to wear tonight. I've got the concentration of a small child. Patience - well, not all the time. A wounded look and a silly smile. That always gets me what I want. I've got a garden, but it has no grass. It's got plastic chairs and the tables glass. My cat at home thinks it's a dog. And who am I to judge if that's all?. I've got a lot of cards on my shelf. Everyone of them written to myself. I've got a million pounds in the bank. (Don't be silly you haven't been to a bank in your life). There's a woman next door who robbed a bank. A man upstairs who likes to drink. And sing to us at 3 in the morning. I've got 5 best friends, 2 parents and a brother. And a man at home who likes to think. That every song's written for him. So this one's for you"

It's my life, it's my life"

No earthly ships will ever bring him home again. Bring him home again. My lover's gone. I know that kiss will be my last. No more his song. The tune upon his lips has passed. I sing alone. while I watch the ocean. My lover's gone. No earthly ships will ever bring him home again. Bring him home again."

I never wanna say it's love. But it's really what I'm thinking of. I could apologise,. And say 'tear it up,. And put it down to the pills I've taken'. Seeing my friends with their lives moved on. While I've been gently drifting. I never wanna say it's love. But it's really what I'm thinking of. I felt the same today. As I was feeling yesterday. It'll be the same tomorrow. From then on, it won't change. I never wanna say it's love. But it's really what I'm thinking of. My home is home. And I'm settled now. I've made it through the restless phase. I have no reason to get bored anymore. My friends are around and your name comes up. Asking if I ever heard from you. I'm keeping it quiet about those words to you. But I meant every word that I said. I stand by every word that I said. I never wanna say it's love. But it's really what I'm thinking of. I felt the same today. As I was feeling yesterday.

Holding you in my hand. And seeing as you'd see. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No love without freedom. No freedom without love. No freedom without love

It's been a long time coming. But it's well worth waiting. And I raise my hands. And ask for nothing more. If we are of the same mind. Finally. It was worth the calamity of you being mad at me. You know I've got feeling too. They come stealing through and batter me properly. Revealing my sensitivity. We don't get this time for free. Take my hand and promise me. Your love and honesty. And this soliloquy will not have been in vain. On our journey through life. Lets take the slow train. It's been a long time coming. Waiting for the train. But it's well worth waiting. Take my hand. And I raise my hands. We don't get this time for free. And ask for nothing more. It's been a long time coming. But it's well worth waiting. And I raise my hands. And ask for nothing more. This Bright Start Shining. @Dido_BR"
northern skies,I have returned to northern skies. Where summer hasn't touched. The clouds that pass above. I have returned to the sombre greys. Of days too early to come. And too hurried to stay. I have left a million stars. And an ocean light and clearly blue. I have left the warmth of the sun. And a million adventures. Not yet begun. For once there was beauty here for me. Under the wide northern skies. And once there was magic here for me. Under the wide northern skies. I saw trees as green. And this dark as blue. Heartbreak and poetry. With deeper roots. But now I know this is lonely country. And it leads me only back to the sea. For once there was beauty here for me. Under the wide northern skies. And once there was magic here for me. Under the wide northern skies...
nyc,"White house on the beach. My steps down to the sand. The plane takes off and we. We are jet when it lags. Waiting in a room. Where the windows won't open. Got coffee with no mud. And their heart still ain't broken. Still ain't broken. Still ain't broken. And the music stops. And the beat goes on. And the music stops. But I'm dancing on. I won't be home until I've walked. Every street in New York. And I'll walk on without your love. Without your love. Dancing on til I'm alone. There's no need to return. Without your love, until I have walked. Every street in New York.

paris,Coming back from Paris on the train. I really didn't care if the journey took all day. Try to turn the pages of my magazine. Whilst trying to keep a hold of your hand and. Ordering a coffee that I wouldn't ever drink. Just to keep you and Paris on my mind. Just to keep you and Paris on my mind. I didn't know it would be the last time. The last time I saw you.

see you when you're 40,"""See You When You're 40"". I've driven round in circles for three hours. It was bound to happen that I'd end up at yours. I temporarily forgot there's better days to come. I thought that I would give it just one more chance. Cos I want, tonight, what I've been waiting for. But I found, tonight, what I'd been warned about. You think you are complicated, deep mystery to all. Well it's taken me a while to see, you're not so special. All energy no meaning, with a lot of words. So paper thin that one real feeling, could knock you down. And I've seen, tonight, what I'd been warned about. I'm gonna leave, tonight, before I change my mind. So see you when you're 40, lost and all alone. Being comforted by strangers you'll never need to know. Not sad because you lost me but sad because you thought it was cool to be sad. You think misery will make you stand apart from the crowd. Well if you had walked past me today I wouldn't have picked you out. I wouldn't have picked you out. Now I've seen, tonight, how could I waste my time. And I'll be on my way, and I won't be back. Cos I've seen, tonight, what I've been warned about. You're just a boy, not a man,. And I'm not coming back"
sitting on the roof of the world,I climbed a mountain. Not knowing that I had. Thought it was just a road from a to b. I took no protection. Not much of anything. Just went as I was. Looking in windows. And playing songs. And knocking on doors. And I was not scared. I just enjoyed the sights. Kept myself to myself. There I was. Sitting on the roof of the world. There I was. There I was. Not knowing how I got there. Or how to leave. Everyone says. I was lucky to have got there. As not many can. But truth be told. I was saved. By the love. Of a good man. Who came and got me. [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/sitting-on-the-roof-of-the-world-lyrics-dido.html ]. And bought me down. From on. Up there. I'd be lying if I didn't say. I missed it now and then. But I have no wish to go back there. There I was. Sitting on the roof of the world. There I was. With all the gods. Not knowing how I got there. Or how to leave. People say. What's so special about being back here. With everyone so close. But that's the point. I don't want to be different. I just want to fit in. There I was. There I was. Sitting on the roof of the world. There I was. With all the gods. Not knowing how I got there. Or how to leave

stoned,"""Stoned"". When you're stoned baby, and I am drunk. And we make love it seems a little desolate. It's hard sometimes not to look away.

Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you. Instead you will be missing me when I go. 'Cos I'm bored of hanging out in your cold. When I feel loved baby, I join the road. And the world moves with me. When I feel lost I just slip away silently. Quietly take my things and go. And think what's the point. Think where's the hope when coming home 'cos. If you won't let me fall for you. Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you. Instead you will be missing me when I go. 'Cos I'm bored of hanging out in your cold. And if you find one day, find some freedom and relief. With this freedom maybe, maybe you will find some peace and. With this peace baby, I hope it brings you back to me. Bring you home, take me home 'cos. If you won't let me fall for you. Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you. Instead you will be missing me when I go. 'Cos I'm bored of hanging out in your cold. Oh, take me home. Oh, take me home. When you're stoned, baby, take me home. Oh"
summer,We can make it rain again. I'd feel like I belong. Let's make it cold again. I'm not ready and it's wrong. We can put the outdoor chairs back in and lock the door. Go back to walking all heads down and put our coats back on. The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you. We can stay at home and draw the blinds and light a fire. Pull the covers high and go to sleep early for hours. Don't want to be too hot and there's no way to cool down. Don't want to sit outside all night or even leave the house. The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you. I don't want to sit and drink in parks and watch the sun go down. Don't want to put my feet in water and lie back in the grass. I don't want to watch the plains go by or hold anybody's hand. The summer's come too soon and I can't come back to you. The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you. And if the sun would go down. Stop reminding us how. If we ever had a chance. I don't by now

thank you,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window,. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. I drank too much last night, got bills to pay. My head just feels in pain. I missed the bus and there'll be hell today. I'm late for work again. And even if I'm there, they'll all imply. That I might not last the day. And then you call me and it's not so bad. It's not so bad. And I want to thank you. For giving me the best day of my life. Oh, just to be with you. Is like having the best day of my life. Push the door,I'm home at last.

the day before the day,"Speeches won't be made today, clocks will carry on. Flowers won't be left in parks, work will still be done. People won't be dressed in black, babies will be born. No flags will fly, the sun will rise but we will know that you are gone. You who love to love and believed we can never give enough. It wakes me every single night thinking through the day. Did you stop at any time, have doubts at any stage. Or were you calm or were you numb or happy just to get it done. I've lived my life without regret until today. And you who love to love and believed we can never give enough. I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day. Was trying to get to work on time that's why I turned away. And missed the most important thing you ever tried to say. I've lived my life without regret until today. And you who love to love and believed we can never give enough. And you who hoped that underneath we all felt the same. That was until the day before the day, the day before the day. The day before the day, oh the day before the day. The day before the day, oh the day before the day. Oh the day before the day, oh the day before the day"
this land is mine,"""This Land Is Mine"". From behind these walls I hear your song. Oh sweet words. The music that you play lights up my world. The sweetest that I've heard. Could it be that I've been touched and turned?. Oh love, please finally, finally things are changing. This land is mine. But I let you rule. I let you navigate on demand. Just as long as you know. This land is mine. So find your home and settle in. Oh I'm ready to let you in. Just as long as we know. This land is mine. After all the battles and the wars. The scars and loss. Well I'm still the queen of my domain. And feeling stronger now. The walls are down a little more each day. Since you came finally, finally things are changing. This land is mine. But I let you rule. I let you navigate on demand. Just as long as you know. This land is mine. So find your home and settle in. Oh I'm ready to let you in. Just as long as we know. This land is mine. Follow the days I've travelled alone. In this cold and colorless place to mend. It's what I had to pay. This land is mine. But I let you rule. I let you navigate on demand. Just as long as you know. This land is mine. So find your home and settle in. Oh I'm ready to let you in. Just as long as we know. This land is mine"

too bad,"Last time I saw you. You left me crying on the floor. You just stepped over me. Running for the door. And if you think I want you back. You must be mad. Even if you were the last man. Cruel does not describe what you were to me. And my smile cannot disguise. And it's too bad. You left me. Too sad you're trying to get back into my life. And it's too bad. You made the wrong choice. Too sad I just don't care. Don't wanna know that I'm right. And it's too bad. The last time I saw you. You said you'd leave me wanting more. And at the time I believed you. And if you say you miss me. You can't have her. No I, I wouldn't touch you. And it's too bad. You left me. Too sad you're trying to get back into my life. And it's too bad. You made the wrong choice. Too sad I just don't care. Don't wanna know that I'm right. And it's too bad"

winter,"I could leave it on the floor. Down the hall by the door. I could hang it out in the sun. And leave it there when you come home. I'll just leave it there. It's much warmer there. I don't care if people stop and stare. I could keep it safe and quiet. Turned away from the light. I could just wave it goodbye. And carry on. As though nothing’s wrong, oh nothing's wrong. But that don't make it right. Coz it's winter in my heart. Feel like paper is ripped apart. And if you knew how very hard it is to. Live the way I want to live. When it's winter in my heart. Feel like paper is ripped apart. And if you knew how very hard it is to. Live the way I want to live. When it's winter in my heart"
