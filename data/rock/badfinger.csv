midnight caller,Beneath the midnight caller. She thinks of paper green. You never hear them calling her name. They just know where they've been. You never hear them holler. The tears no longer come. She reads a daily book of her past. That shows of everyone. Greys that show in her hair. Can't be but don't seem to care. She locks the door. And there's no one there. She sees a daytime stroller. Walked from the night before. And though she paints a smile on her face. He won't be back no more. Shes got no Saint to follow. Shes got no place to go. Too proud to ask an old friend for help. Too proud to let them know. Greys that show in her hair. Can't be but don't seem to care. She locks the door. And there's no one there. Nobodys gonna help you now

And I believe if we let it, our love will grow. Our love will grow. Our love will grow."
the name of the game,"I saw the railway master, and I looked him in the eye. Said ""Would you go much faster. if you thought that you would die?"". He said ""Not me sir, I could not care, in fact I would not try. For protest would not take me far. it's different me not being a star."". I lock my feelings in a jar, until another day. Oh comfort me dear brother, won't you tell me what you know. For somewhere in this paper world is a place where I can go. Oh long-awaited mother, is it time to make a show?. And take your babies to your breasts. you know we never passed the test. And all our sins should be confessed before we carry on.. Oh, don't refuse me. if you choose me, you'll follow my shame. No, don't confuse me. for I know it's the name of the game. I got up off my pillow and I looked up at the sun. Said ""You can see quite clearly now. the things that we have done.. We've burned your sacred willow and our battles, we have won.. But did we get so very far?. It's different me not being a star."". I lock my feelings in a jar, until they go away. Oh, don't refuse me. if you choose me, you'll follow my shame. No, don't confuse me. for I know it's the name of the game"

We can change the dice that's cast. I remember how they laughed then. But I knew it wouldn't last. I've tried so hard to close my eyes. But I just can't close my mind. When will we ever learn?. When will we turn around?. When will we ever learn?. When will we ever learn?. One thing's for certain while we're here. One thing's for sure, only the fear. I've tried so hard to close my eyes. But I just can't close my mind. When will we ever learn?. When will we turn around?. When will we ever learn?. When will we ever learn?"
walk out in the rain,So I just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain. And maybe you will never see the 1000 tears you gave to me. And if the rain should go away then in my lonely room I'll stay. So that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go away. So I just live a life of hope pretending that I could not care. But if you find you cannot cope just call my name and I'll be there. If I could live my life again I still relive those precious times. Although I know there will be pain it felt so good while you were mine. Be mine be mine. So I Just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain. And maybe you will never see the 1000 tears you gave to me. And if the rain should go away then in my lonely room I stay. So that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go. And if you ever change your mind. I'm sure baby you will find all my sorrow and my pain. You'll find me walking in the rain

you ask yourself why,The more you see of your love. The more you must try. Try to throw away those reasons to cry. It’s no surprise you wonder why. You ever believed it.

You ask yourself why. They know why you feel the pain go by. You don’t ask why you read the news. And you better believe it. As clouds go by you see anew. And you wanna perceive it.

Made me want you more and more. Came into my life. I asked for more, more and more. [guitar solo (Pete Ham)]. Can't get enough. Enough of your love. I've learned my lesson well. Now it's good enough. Maybe someday the world will come. I'm alive. I'm alive. Builds around me fences. Put my back against the wall. You broke into my world and made me crawl. Broken my defenses. Made me want you more and more. You came into my life. I asked for more, more and more."
