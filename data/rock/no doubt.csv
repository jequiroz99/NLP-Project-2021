I told my mom how I was feeling. And how long I've been dealing with it. Knew it was coming, but I didn't know how soon. She said I've reached another adolescent monsoon.

Shipwrecked into you. Situation is foolish. Put up a fight. You're my big disctraction. Obvious companion. I'm falling fast. Like an avalanche. Indentured servant. A slave to a slave. Thank God for my hopeful heart. And for mutual feelings. Look how it's balanced now. Maybe we'll just settle down. For the rest of our lives. Wrong or right. Shipwrecked into you. Situation is foolish. Put up a fight. You're my big distraction. Obvious companion. I'm falling fast. Like an avalanche. Look how it's balanced now. Maybe we'll just settle down.

bathwater,You and your museum of lovers. The precious collection you've housed in your covers. My simpleness threatened by my own admission. And the bags are much too heavy. In my insecure condition. My pregnant mind is fat full with envy again. But I still love to wash in your old bathwater. Love to think that you couldn't love another. I can't help it... you're my kind of man. Wanted and adored by attractive women. Bountiful selection at your discretion. I know I'm diving into my own destruction. So why do we choose the boys that are naughty?. I don't fit in so why do you want me?. And I know I can't tame you... but I just keep trying. 'Cause I love to wash in your old bathwater. Love to think that you couldn't love another. I'm on you list with all your other women. But I still love to wash in your old bathwater. You make me feel like I couldn't love another. I can't help it... you're my kind of man. Why do the good girls always want the bad boys?. So I pacify problems with kisses and cuddles. Diligently doubtful through all kinds of trouble. Then I find myself choking on all my contradictions. 'Cause I still love to wash in your old bathwater. Love to think that you couldn't love another. Share a toothbrush... you're my kind of man. I still love to wash in your old bathwater. Make me feel like I couldn't love another. I can't help it... you're my kind of man. No I can't help myself. I can't help myself. I still love to wash in your old bathwater
almost blue,(Elvis Costello). Almost blue. Almost doing things we used to do. There's a boy here and he's almost you. Almost all the things that your eyes once promised. I see in him too. Now your eyes are red from crying. Almost blue. Flirting with this disaster became me. It named me as the fool who only aimed to be. Almost blue. It's almost touching that we're almost through.

different people,"Things can be broken down. In this world of ours. You don't have to be a famous person. Just to make your mark. A mother can be an inspiration. To her little son. Change his thoughts, his mind, his life,. Just with her gentle hum. So different, yet so the same. Two sisters only have their parents to blame. It's rare that two can get along. But when they do, they're inseparable. Such a blessing comes to few. Chorus:. The sky is full of clouds and. My world's full of people. All different kinds with different ways. It would take a lifetime to explain. No one's exactly the same. He and she, two different people. With two seperate lives. Then you put the two together. And get a spectacular surprise. 'Cause one can teach the other one. What she doesn't know. While still the other fills a place inside. He never knew had room to grow. Chorus. Once in a while I sit back. And think about the planet. Most of the time I trip on it. To kick back and think about. How massive it all is. And how many others are on it. I often think about the world. In which I live today, of animals and plants. And nature's gift set in display. But the most amazing thing. That I've seen in my time. Are all the different people. And all their different minds. And different ways. It would take a lifetime to explain. No one's exactly the same. So many different people. So many different kinds. So many, many, many different people. So many different. Look at me, I'm a person. Look at me, I'm my own person. So many different people. So many different kinds. For better or for worse, different people"
tragic kingdom,"Once was a magical place. Over time it was lost. Price increased the cost. Now the fortune of the kingdom. Is locked up in its dungeon vaults. The castle floor lies in traps. With coiled wires set back. Decayed by old cheese. Now the drawbridge has been lifted. As the millions. They drop to their knees. They pay homage to a king. Whose dreams are buried. In their minds. His tears are frozen stiff. Icicles drip from his eyes. The cold wind blows as it snows. On those who fight to get in. On heads that are small. Disillusioned as they enter. They're unaware what's. Behind castle walls. But now it's written in stone. The king has been overthrown. By jesterly fools. And the power of the people. Shall come to believe they do rule. They pay homage to a king. Whose dreams are buried. In their minds. His tears are frozen stiff. Icicles drip from his eyes. Welcome to the tragic kingdom. Cornfields of popcorn. Have yet to spring open. Have they lost their heads. Or are they all blind mice. We've heard all their stories. One too many times. Hypnotized by fireflies. That glow in the dark. Midgets that disguise themselves. As tiny little dwarfs. The parade that's electrical. It serves no real purpose. Just takes up a lot of juice. Just to impress us. They pay homage to a king. Whose dreams are buried. In their minds. His tears are frozen stiff. Icicles drip from his eyes. Oh, they drip from his eyes. Into the night. They drip from his eyes. They're paying homage to a king. A king who's buried. Buried in their minds. They drip from his eyes. Welcome to the tragic kingdom. Cornfields of popcorn. Have yet to spring open. Welcome to the tragic kingdom (8x)"

I noticed his hairy hands... he was a very, very hairy man. He looked right down in, shook his head and then. said ""these teeth must be pulled right away!"". (Repeat Chorus). He turned around, rolled up his sleeve. I rolled my eyes then suddenly. A horrible pain grew, the next thing that I knew. The doc had pulled my wisdom teeth . . OUT!. Well along with my teeth my money also left me. As he made out the bill, I was moaning. OOoo Ahh... the pain is tremendous. Where the hell is my prescription.... of codeine?. But when will I speak, how long until my mouth feels natural?. How long will they bleed, when will they heal, where's a real meal?. How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel?. I feel good... I feel great... there's no pain... there's no ache. I feel good... I feel great... just let me recuperate. Because the codeine has left me drowsy, leave me be... just let me sleep!"

bathwater,You and your museum of lovers. The precious collection you've housed in your covers. My simpleness threatened by my own admission. And the bags are much too heavy. In my insecure condition. My pregnant mind is fat full with envy again. But I still love to wash in your old bathwater. Love to think that you couldn't love another. I can't help it... you're my kind of man. Wanted and adored by attractive women. Bountiful selection at your discretion. I know I'm diving into my own destruction. So why do we choose the boys that are naughty?.

big distraction,You're my concentration. Everything else is a bore. I've got myself snagged on you. No self-control now. All that I want to do. Sleep in the shadow of you. For the rest of my life. Now we can chisel. Chisel off built up walls. Of pain deposited from past lovers. Memories they can sleep. And we can live comfortably. For the rest of our lives. Wrong or right. Shipwrecked into you. Situation is foolish. Put up a fight. You're my big disctraction. Obvious companion. I'm falling fast. Like an avalanche. Indentured servant. A slave to a slave. Thank God for my hopeful heart. And for mutual feelings. Look how it's balanced now. Maybe we'll just settle down. For the rest of our lives. Wrong or right. Shipwrecked into you. Situation is foolish. Put up a fight. You're my big distraction. Obvious companion. I'm falling fast. Like an avalanche. Look how it's balanced now. Maybe we'll just settle down.

At last she opens the back gate, you're realeased,. You're now free to roam. You've been waiting for this moment for sometime. And now you must go. Into the fields where there is laughter,. There is peace and you're comfortable. Try to hold on now before she calls you home!. You're in the doghouse. 'Cause you're just a dog!"
don't let me down,"Laughing so hard. I got tears in my eyes. Walk in the park. Under sapphire skies. Oh, I can't believe that you're still around. Almost forgot how you let me down. Crying so deep.

No not a little bit. Cause now you're all mine. Don't you forget it. Don't blow it. Even a little bit. Cause now you're all mine. Don't you forget it. (Don't let me down) X3. Time after time. It's just too much to take. I've waited so long. Just to get to this place. And finally it feels like. The lost was found. You got me filled up now. Don't let me down. (Don't let me down). CHORUS x2.

dreaming the same dream,Just like the wind takes the leaf from the tree. You always know how to dismantle me. Yeah you're (?) is making me weak. And it's a comment not a compliment. Just a vacation and apologies. Guess I'm suseptable(spelling?) to more tragedy. Cross your heart but theres not guarentees. It's not fair but whos keeping score?. How many times can a promise be broken?. Who taught you how to love?. Are we on the same side?. We know how to play this game. You fall and then I catch you. And then you kiss me goodnight. Close your eyes and think of me. I wanna be with you. Dreaming the same dream. Why you playing around with me?. Put it away in little compartments. This didn't happen by accident. I've got your back but your so broken. We always come back for more. How many times can a promise be broken?. Who taught you how to love?. Are we on the same side?. We know how to play this game. You fall and then I catch you. And then you kiss me goodnight. Close your eyes and think of me. I wanna be with you. Dreaming the same dream. Why you playing around with me?. Who taught you how to love?. I try and try and try I don't understand and there must be a good reason.. Are we on the same side?. We know how to play this game. You fall and then I catch you. And then you kiss me goodnight. Close your eyes and think of me. I wanna be with you. Dreaming the same dream. Why you playing around with me?. Are we dreaming the same dream?. Why you playing around with me?. Are we dreaming the same dream?

And it's my gut feeling. It's not happening for me, so.... Let's end it on this. Give me one last kiss. Let's end it on this. Let's end it on this. You see it's hard to face. The addict that's inside of me. I want to fill my glass up. With you constantly. I've been here before. But I've never ever felt this sure. And now I know I've been dreaming. And your actions. Have inspired me, so.... CHORUS. I open up, you ignore me. You're not the same at all. And if I could turn back. The pages of time. I'd rewrite your point of view. Washed up on the shore. Given one last chance. To try some more. But I'm tired, I'm freezing. Let's stop and call it history"

everything's wrong,"(E. Stefani, J. Rosa). The bed is made, so is the cake. The frogs are swimming down in the lake. The chairs are stacked and the house is locked. The food is eaten and the boat is docked. The flowers are watered and the glass is filled. The chain is linked, the money's billed. The walls are painted and the bell has rang. What is wrong? Everything!. 1, 2, 3, 4. Everything everything everything's wrong. Ever quit your bitchin and you want to go on. But if you look at me you laugh and you say. 'Why just give me another thing, don't tell me this way'. Everything's wrong. Everything's wrong. Your hat is sewn, the clock is set. The toilet's flushed and the sponge is wet. The lights are on and your shoes are tied. My posters are up and my hair is dyed. The house is built and the records scratched. Your dishes are dirty and your pants are patched. The chrome is shiny and the juice tastes like tang. What is wrong? Everything!. That's all I say, I say no more. So please don't ask for an encore!. 1, 2, 3, 4. Everything everything everything's wrong. Ever quit your bitchin and you want to go on. But if you look at me you laugh and you say. 'Why just give me another thing, don't tell me this way'.

hey baby,"Hey Baby. I?m the kinda girl that hangs with the guys. Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes. Takin it in, try to be feminine. With my makeup bag watchin all the sin. Misfit, I sit, lit up, wicked. Everybody else surrounded by the girls. With the tank tops and the flirty words. I?m just sippin on chamomile. Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal. With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom. And went to my high school. (Chorus). All the boys say,. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Girls Say, Girls Say,. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Hey Baby Baby. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Boys Say, Boys Say. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. All the boys get the girls in the back. I?m the one they feed upon. Give a bit a star is born. And if you're hot enough you?ll get the pass. And you can tell your friends how you made it back. No matter what they say I?m still the same. Somehow everybody knows my name. And all the girls wanna get with the boys. And the boys really like it. (Chorus). (Bounty Killer). Check it out, it's Bounty Killer and No Doubt. Jump on the stage, girls be going crazy,.

Got me off the hook and nothing else don't faze me. Can you be my one and only sunshine lady?. No if nor maybe, hey baby. (Gwen). I?m just sippin on chamomile.

hey you,"Hey you with the wedding dress on. Made of white chiffon blowing in the wind. Hey you with the dreams in your head. You've been so mislead by your heart's pull. I know you're waiting for your ship to come in. You anxiously wait for such a long time. You're just like my Ken and Barbie doll. You dress up and play the game. You're just like my Ken and Barbie doll. Your name will never change. Hey you with your eyes full of hope. You think you can rope your desire. Hey you, you naive thing.

In a plastic world of make believe. You're just like my Ken and Barbie doll. You know he's just gonna leave"

I need to have you. I need to hold you. Barren wasted heart. Neglect of normalcy. And if you lived here you?d be home now. Oh if you lived here you?d be home now. And to make it real. I need to have you here. I need to have you. It can?t be sincere. Unless you spend time here. I need to see you?Supervision is what I need. Some consistence, tangibility. Some casual light days. Part of the furniture. I want to take you for granted. And see you regular. So what you givin? up for me?. And what shall I give up for you?. The separation's tired, it?s been too long. And to make it real. I need to have you here. I need to have you. It can?t be sincere. Unless you spend time here. I need to see you. I need you?. Come home now"

it's the end of the world as we know it,"(originally recorded by R.E.M.). performed live by No Doubt. That's great, it starts with an earthquake.. Birds and snakes, an aeroplane and Lenny Bruce is not afraid.. Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn.. World serves its own needs, dummy serve your own needs.. Feed it off an aux speak, grunt, no, strength, no,. Ladder start to clatter with fear fight down height.. Fire in a wire, representing seven games.. A government for hire and a combat site.. Left of west and coming in a hurry,. With the furies breathing down your neck.. Team by team reporters baffled, trumped, tethered cropped.. Look at that low playing! Fine, then.. Uh oh, overflow, population, common food, but it'll do.. Save yourself, serve yourself, world serves its own needs.. Listen to your heart bleed dummy with the rapture.. And the revered and the right, right.. You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight,. Bright light, feeling pretty psyched.. It's the end of the world as we know it.. It's the end of the world as we know it.. It's the end of the world as we know it. and I feel fine.. Six o'clock - TV hour, don't get caught in foreign towers.. Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn.. Locking in, uniforming, book burning, blood letting.. Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate.. Light a candle, light a votive. Step down, step down.. Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh oh, this means no fear cavalier.. Renegade steer clear! A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies.. Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, I decline.. It's the end of the world as we know it.. It's the end of the world as we know it.. It's the end of the world as we know it.. and I feel fine.. I feel fine.. The other night I dreamt of knives, continental drift divide.. Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein.. Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs.. Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!. You symbiotic, patriotic, slam book neck, right? Right.. It's the end of the world as we know it.. It's the end of the world as we know it.. It's the end of the world as we know it.. and I feel fine.. It's time, I spent some time alone.. It's time, I spent some time alone.. It's time, I spent some time alone..

magic's in the makeup,Can you tell I?m faking it?. But I want to be myself. A counterfeit disposition. Can?t be good for my health. So many different faces. Depending on the different phases. My personality changes. I?m a chameleon. There?s more than one dimension. I can fool you and attract attention. Camouflage my nature. Let me demonstrate?. Makeup?s all off. Who am I?. Magic?s in the makeup. Who am I?. If you bore me them I?m comfortable. If you interest me I?m scared. My attraction paralyzes me. No courage to show my true colors that exist. But I want to be the real thing. But if you catch my eye can?t be authentic. The ones I loath are the one?s that know me the best. My makeup?s all off. Who am I?. The magic?s in the makeup. Who am I?. The makeup?s all off. Who am I?. If magic?s in the makeup. Then who am I?. Magic?s in the makeup. But I want to be the real thing. But the magic?s in the makeup. And I want to be the real thing. My makeup?s all off. Who am I?
making out,Yeah.... I'm on the second floor with a lock on my door. I'm looking at a picture of your face. The last time I looked you were looking really good. But somehow pictures fade.

I'm counting the days. I hardly can wait. For us to hang out. I'm really missing it. In so many ways. I anticipate us making out. (Here comes another one). Sip my morning tea but you're not next to me. Here goes another day. And driving in my car. I wonder how you are. As our favorite music plays. And the flowers arrived to my surprise. But that just ain't good enough. And I got the note. It gave me hope. But that just ain't good enough. So I'm just kicking it. I'm counting the days. I hardly can wait. For us to hang out.

marry me,"I can’t help that I like to be kissed. And I wouldn’t mind if my name changed to Mrs.. This is one side, my conventional side. An attraction to tradition. My vintage disposition. My sincere architecture. And I want to cook him dinner. But I’m more indecisive than ever. And who believes in forever?. Who will be the one to marry me?. A girl in the world barking up the wrong tree. A creature conditioned to employ matrimony. Crumbling continuity, I pick up the pieces. The ceremony makes me zealous. As the past quickly ceases. Fear from being neutered. I’m now prude, now defensive. Quickly I’m altered and tempted by new love only rented. Do you believe you’ll marry me?. You might be the one to marry me. Back, looking back, looking back at me. I’m not how I used to be. Take me back, take back into history. Diamond ring, tie me down just like it used to be. Who will be the one to marry me?. Who will be the one to marry me?"
mighty mouse,"played live in 1989. Mr. Trouble never hangs around. When he hears this mighty sound.... ""Here I come to save the day!"". That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way.. Yessir when there is a wrong to right. Mighty Mouse will join the fight. On the sea or on the land. He gets the situation well in hand. So though we are in danger. We never despair.

move on,"Some chickens crossed the road, straying far from the hen. Five reached the side one step below Zen. One was a female, four were mad-men. Who moved on, moved on moved on. Standing in line and falling asleep. Building a fence while we're counting the sheep. We'd let you help out but our projects too deep. Move on, move on, move on. You have to understand that. When it comes to making music. We meshed the styles of five alive. And interwined and fused it. Life comes from life and through our strife. We strove to make the sound true. Compelled to spell it out, no doubt. In search of what we must do. Our house was too small so we had to move. The neighbors had much doubts so we had to prove. That our soulful dimensions were too true to the groove. We moved on, moved on, moved on. Water the music, plant the seeds in the pot. Music is the life flowing through... is it not?. Don't forget your roots, but also don't rot. Just move on, move on, move on. (Repeat Chorus). Don't be afraid, let your feelings show. Wear your heart on your sleeve, and let yourself glow"

You, you’re new. And I never had this taste in the past. New, you’re so new. My normal hesitation is gone. And I really gravitate to your will. Are you here to fetch me out?. ‘Cause I’ve never had this taste in my mouth. Oh you’re not old. And you’re not familiar. Recently discovered and I’m learning about you. New, you’re so new.

oi to the world,"Haji was a punk just like any other boy. And he never had no trouble till he started up his Oi band. Safe in the garage or singing in the tub. Till Haji went too far and he plugged in at the pub. 'Twas a cold Christmas eve when Trevor and the skins. Popped in for a pint and to nick a back of crisps. Trevor liked the music but not the unity. He unwound Haji's turban and he knocked him to his knees. If God came down on Christmas Day. I know exactly what he'd say. He'd say ""Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins. But Oi to the world and everybody wins"". Haji was a bloody mess, he ran out through the crowd. He said ""We'll meet again we are bloody but not unbowed"". Trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet. Christmas Day on the roof down at 20 Oxford Street. If God came down on Christmas Day. I know exactly what he'd say. He'd say ""Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins. But Oi to the world and everybody wins"". On the roof with the nun chucks Trevor broke a lot of bones. But Haji had a sword like that guy in Indiana Jones. Police sirens wailing, a bloody dying man. Haji was alone and abandoned by his band. Trevor was there fading and still so full of hate. When the skins left him there and went down the fire escape. (Oi, Oi). And then Haji saw the north star shining more then ever. So he made a tourniquet from his turban saving Trevor. They repelled down the roof with the rest of the turban. And went back to the pub where they bought each other bourbon. If God came down on Christmas Day. I know exactly what he'd say. He'd say ""Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins. But Oi to the world and everybody wins"". If God came down on Christmas Day. I know exactly what he'd say. He'd say ""Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins. But Oi to the world and everybody wins"". (Oi, Oi)"

You're callow and you're green. 'Cause you're caught between. You're only sixteen. Try to cross the line. But your little wings are intertwined. You're only sixteen. And you're such a tease. And there's nothing you do. That can really please. ""These children. They're not really bad most of them. They're just products. Of rotten neighborhoods. And bad family situations"". You know you can't forsake it. So sit back and take it. You see you're just not ripe. So don't try and fight that. You're only sixteen. You wana catch a peek. But they look at you. Like you're such a freak. Well you're only sixteen. With a lot to say. But they won't give you. The time of day. You're only sixteen!. You're only sixteen!. You're just sixteen!!. You poor little thing."
snakes,Open the basket. Listen to the flute play. Open the basket. Listen to the flute play. Toot toot toot toot play. Snakes in the basket. Lie to lead you astray. Snakes in the basket. Force to make you betray. Your innermost truths hid away. Falling down to the underground. As you slither down to your lair. Hidden in the many trenches of a hopeless war. Those who were sold out by a corporate board. Carry the casket. Never mind the gun spray. Bury the casket. Pawns in someone's gameplay. Shoot shoot shoot shoot obey. Subscription to the spreading of lies. Soldier catches a glimpse of his demise. Deep down inside even he knows. Snakes come in many shapes and sizes. Snakes have no hands to be tied. Concoction of malicious lies. Deep inside the general despises himself... Listen to the flute play. Another reptile in line. Snakes without grass cannot hide. Falling down to the underground. As you slither down to your lair. Forked tongues spread the poison with a toxic sting. So much pain their serpentine inhibitions bring
sometimes,Sometimes sunshine. Does not want to shine on me. And sometimes I find myself blind. At first I cannot see and then I see it's me. I chose a road when I was young. In search of fun temptation won. And all my soul I did surrender. If I had a chance to go back now. Would I redeem my moral vows. Or would I repeat for my own laughter. Sometimes I hide somewhat. Like a bulb behind a shade. And sometimes I ask myself why. Is it cause the lights are too bright. Or because my eyes are closed too tight. Sometimes I find myself blind. Don't use my brain don't use my mind. Distorted feelings always leading my way. But I must forgive myself. and let the past lay down to rest. And I'll be prepared to face myself in another day. From now on I will behave. But in the back of my mind I will be enslaved

the climb,"Step by step I come closer to reaching the top. Every step must be placed so that I don't fall off. Looking down to see about how much higher I am. Another cool wind comes through, brushes my skin. The harder I pust the tension does grow. I gather my thoughts the further and further I go. With some luck I just might keep on climbing. So better to climb than to face a fall. So high the climb. Can't turn back now. Must keep climbing up to the clouds. So high the climb. Can't turn back now. Must keep climbing up to the clouds. Pulling myself up by a rop I better my view. The only thing in sight is what I must do. As I turned I could see myself falling. Which in teturn gave me strength for the climb. Chorus. Although many failed. I must now prevail with no question. Have no time to stop. Onward to the top of the mountain. And I can't turn back now. It's so very high but I can't turn back now. If I keep it up, I'm gonna make it. I'm so very close can't you see. Chorus. I'm getting closer..."
too late,I just want to take you away from everyone. And keep you stashed under my pillow. And then I’d take you out simply for my own pleasure. And wear you when the occasions special. Then I’d put you on like a diamond. So I can sparkle and be the envy of my friends. I’d proudly hold the leash that I’d have you on. So you can’t stray and follow me around all day. It’s too late now. I don’t think it can fade. It’s too real now. Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze. Compulsion has stained me. I’m nervously cradling our young love. Without known limits love. Like a butterfly cupped in my hands. I peek in to see beauty trapped. Confined it flutters. Then it leaves behind colorful dust. To remind me of the special times we’ve spent. But of course it has to leave my clutch. But enough’s never enough to make a dent. It’s too late now. I don’t think it can fade. It’s too real now. Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze. And in time it will end. And there really isn’t hope for the two of us. But right now I give in…. It’s too late now. I don’t think it can fade. It’s too real now. Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze. Fulfillment just adds fuel to the. Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze

tragic kingdom,"Once was a magical place. Over time it was lost. Price increased the cost. Now the fortune of the kingdom. Is locked up in its dungeon vaults. The castle floor lies in traps. With coiled wires set back. Decayed by old cheese. Now the drawbridge has been lifted. As the millions. They drop to their knees. They pay homage to a king. Whose dreams are buried. In their minds. His tears are frozen stiff. Icicles drip from his eyes. The cold wind blows as it snows. On those who fight to get in. On heads that are small. Disillusioned as they enter. They're unaware what's. Behind castle walls. But now it's written in stone. The king has been overthrown. By jesterly fools. And the power of the people. Shall come to believe they do rule. They pay homage to a king. Whose dreams are buried. In their minds. His tears are frozen stiff. Icicles drip from his eyes. Welcome to the tragic kingdom. Cornfields of popcorn. Have yet to spring open. Have they lost their heads. Or are they all blind mice. We've heard all their stories. One too many times. Hypnotized by fireflies. That glow in the dark. Midgets that disguise themselves. As tiny little dwarfs. The parade that's electrical. It serves no real purpose. Just takes up a lot of juice. Just to impress us. They pay homage to a king. Whose dreams are buried. In their minds. His tears are frozen stiff. Icicles drip from his eyes. Oh, they drip from his eyes. Into the night. They drip from his eyes. They're paying homage to a king. A king who's buried. Buried in their minds. They drip from his eyes. Welcome to the tragic kingdom. Cornfields of popcorn. Have yet to spring open. Welcome to the tragic kingdom (8x)"
trapped in a box,"Trapped in a box of tremendous size. It distorts my vision, it closes my eyes. Attracts filthy flies and pollutes in the skies. Sucks up our lives and proliferates lies. Trapped in a box. Trapped in a box, four walls as sky. Got a screen for a window about two feet wide. My mind rides and slides as my circuits are fried. No room for thought, use the box as my guide. Trapped in a box. Trapped in a box. Watch the world as it flocks. To life's paradox. We're all trapped in a box. Trapped in a box I'm not alone. I know of others with a box as their home. Light only enters froma crack or a hole. This is not enough for a human to grow. Trapped in a box. (Repeat Chorus). Always wanting a different view. Instant gratification for you. Reality gone in a single click. Just hope that that switch won't stick. Trapped in a box my life becomes void. All I thought for myself is now destroyed. Controlling my mind, what to eat, what to buy. Subliminal rules: how to live, how to die. Trapped in a box. (Repeat Chorus)"
under construction,"Success serenades me. And pressures at the door. Broken promise debris. Lie around from my mind war. And my accomplishments interrogating me.

'Cause I'm under construction everyone. so you'll have to mind the mess. I'm under some construction. I always had to try harder. I never really could keep up. Sitting in the corner.

'Cause I'm under construction everyone. So you'll have to mind the mess. I'm under some construction. Correction. Modification. Alteration. Construction. And the rituals that soothe and disgust me.

world go round,In the quickness of our haste. It seems we forget how to live. The old blueprint. No longer manifests itself. As the correct way to exist. Wipe the grime off the view hole. And please take a closer look. Environmental bandits. Up to their shenanigans. Crooks disguised.... We've got to find another way. To make the world go 'round. Our individual roles we think. Not so important to the plot. The big picture unseen. Leaving life in between. Destoyed and overwrought. There's no need to point the finger. We understand who takes the blame. Delinquents caught. Red-handed in the act. Crooks disguised as you and I. We've got to find another way. To make the world go 'round. You see there's many many many. People in the world. And I'm not sure if I like. What I've heard. I'm not sure if I like. What I'm doin myself. I'm not sure if I like how it turns. Degradation. Violation. Inexcusable exploitation. It's the dawning of a new era. People consciously don't care. How unfair. We've got to find another way. To make the world go 'round
you can do it,"Since you've been gone. Since you've been unglued. It's hard to figure out. Your next move. One minute here. The next you're gone. Let's make an end. To this sad, sad song. For you it's hard to take. 'Cause the pill has an awful taste. Just open up and swallow down. Once it hits bottom. Things may turn around. Unfortunately this is the case. You've got to catch up. And win the race. Straighten yourself out.... You can do it. One minute here. The next you're gone. Let's make an end. To this sad, sad song. They can't understand. That you mean to do good. I guess you could say. You're misunderstood. I know you're meaning well. But you've been shot to hell. Just come back and join us now. 'Cause I know that you know how. CHORUS. I know it seems. They're messing with your mind. But you don't have to go. Forward blind. So let the bygones bygone. And let's make an end. To this sad, sad song. CHORUS"
you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks,"(E. Stefani). At the park you try to teach a dog a brand new trick. You take a ball and toss it far and then you say ""go get it"". You know you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He only knows what he may. No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He'll only curl his tail and run away. And so you try a new approach, you try to hold and cuddle it. You hope he'll learn it if you try again but he just don't get it. You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He only knows what he may. No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He'll only curl his tail and run away. You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He only knows what he's trained. No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. Not even if you get down and beg. No you can't teach an ol' dog. Remember when you saw him in the window. (You bought him from the local pet store). You can't forget the first time you brought him home. (You brought him home, he went on the floor). You could have taught him then if you would have known. (Party No Doubt!). You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He only knows what he may. No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He'll only curl his tail and run away. You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He only knows what he's trained. No you can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. Not even if you get down and beg. No you can't teach an ol' dog. No no way. You can't teach an ol' dog new tricks. He'll only curl his tail and run away."
you're so foxy,"Everything In Time - Bsides, Rarities, Remixes, 2003. Producer: Glen Ballard. . You caught my fall making out on alcohol. An innocent mistake. Falling in love on accident, I didn't mean to. Constant danger, constant stranger. It started out so sweet. And now we're both feeling incomplete. I don't know how much I can take. We're on, we're off. We're knocked down and getting up. We try to fight it, the agony and ecstasy. And it's painful but it's worth it. 'Cause you're so foxy and I think your kinda good for me. You're so foxy. Mental earthquakes, conversation mistakes. My army of words. I can't believe you're crawling back for more out of desire. Destiny or chemicals, emotions are susceptible. And you I can't resist. I can't seem to walk away from this. So show me how much you can take, are you in or out?. You're knocked down and getting up. You kinda like it, the agony and ecstasy. And it's painful, I'm sorry. But you're so foxy I can't let you get away from me. 'Cause you're so foxy. Oooooooohh, oooooooohh. You're so foxy to me, im so lucky. Cause you're so foxy. So get out of my way I'm feeling so in love today. It can't be understood. And when were felling good it's really good. The kind of good that feels like fate. We're back and forth. We're knocked down and getting up. We try to fight it, the agony and ecstasy. And it's painful but it's your fault. 'Cause you're so foxy and you got yourself all over me. You're so foxy. And I can't take it, it's hard to take it. I can't take it. It's painful but it's worth it. 'Cause you're so foxy. I think you must be good for me"
