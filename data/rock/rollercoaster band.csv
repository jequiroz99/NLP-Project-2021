i'm tired,My world is made of glass walls. I would like to be as I was before. sometimes I feel very different. I believe it may be just a moment.

illusion,Why do you appear in my mind?. I wonder all the time. I need to talk it for you. I need to trust in you. I wish you were real. I see you in my dreams. I want to believe it's real. but it's so hard for me. because I just want to be yours
my libido,"Everything I know about you. is that I need you. maybe you'll show me more. but I don't need to no more. I won't test you, trust me. I have no time for this. do you know what I mean?.

You're not what you seem. take off your disguise. what do you want to hide?. try to make it now
xroads,Say what you have to say and go away. I learned how to keep you away from me. Don't come with your plastic smiles. I have only one thing to say. we walked for a long time. on the same road together. and in the first crossroads. each one went their way. every story needs an ending. to another can begin. his wet eyes do not deceive me anymore. need not be only of your way. I have only one thing to say. we walked for a long time. on the same road together. and in the first crossroads. each one went their way. I remember we had choice. we had choice. I believe we had choice. we had choice x4
