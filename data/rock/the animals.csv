letter from the county farm,"Letter from the county farm, letter from the county farm. And the wind it has been blowin'. Its been blowin' so strong. They're afraid to raise the flag 'less it gets torn to shreds. But God forbid the wind should ever stop blowin'. But if it did. I'm sure we'd all fall down. But sometimes it isn't windy. Like last February. I remember it snowed. and a week later it hailed. And now it looks like raining. Now it looks like raining. I'm convinced that what makes the rain and hail so heavy over here. is that the sherrif has been messing with out minds.. handin' out questionnaries to the pris'ners who are blind. to the pris'ners who are blind. Let me tell you one thing new at the county farm. They've got muzak in the fields. which makes this life of mine a little more unreal. a little more unreal.

I love to sing while I'm workin'. And the wind has been blowin'. And the wind has been blowin'. I've given up reading for a time and taken up other pastimes. Such as watchin' winos gum their food and epileptics havin' bad times. More frequently I've been lost in this game. And it looks like they're gonna make a crim'nal out of me. A criminal out of me. But those guys who are down on me winnin'. Lord knows, they take the game so seriously. But what hurts me more, burts me more than anything. Is when I get your mail. When I get your mail, they've cut you. They've cut out the parts and the words that have feeling. So I'm left with only part of you. I say I'm only left with part of you. And the wind has been blowin'. And the wind has been blowin'. Oh, play your guitar, baby. Play your guitar, baby,. Get me off this farm, baby, take me away.... And apart from all this crap there is some peace and quiet. Except for the screws grumbling and mumbling and calling me a long hair. I wouldn't mind, but they cut my hair quite some time ago. They cut it off when I first came here. Which tells me Indo-China is really here behind this wire. And it soon will be dying engulfed in their own fire, in their own fire. In fact, they tell me that a boy like me shouldn't think like that. But this is murder and everybody accepts that.. Lord knows, they all accept it, and everybody knows thatt ain't where its at. So take care, pray for rain and maybe I'll see you. Visiting hours next week. And when the screw, when the screw says no touching,. Lord knows, I'll turn the other cheek.. (Burdon, Gordon)."

Brown girl from the Bronx showed me her home,. We went there by subway train. She took me there time and time again. Love was our sweet song's name. And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind. And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind. The Negro was my hero and leader. His strange tasting waysâ€¦they turned me on. I tried my best to sound just like him. When he movesâ€¦he moves like lightning. Across the world the news was flashed. The country's young leader was laid to rest. Another ending of a new beginning. Others criedâ€¦some were grinning.

The government paid, the government spent over $250,000 to train me as a pilot, and then after I got overseas, a general sent his adjutant down to meet our group to say that we didn't send for you and we don't want you. That's right. This is the truth, I'm telling you the truth! This is straight life but, ah, somehow we go onâ€¦ We go on because we would like to think there's hope.

You know the town that I was born in, we didn't have no streets? It was all dirt roads, dirt roads and poor people, nobody had nothing. Matter of fact, we used to get together to have community meals. Somebody had cabbage, somebody else had some meat, somebody else had some corn mean and we'd get together and we'd make a meal, have a community dinner. That was when we were lucky and then we'd play cards. We didn't have any signals 'cause we didn't need any. Nobody had any cars. That's right! And on the corner, on particular corners, there were accidents all the time. Most of the people who were hurt in the accidents died just because nobody came to pick them up. The ambulance never came.

He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile. The order is given. They move down the line. But he's still behind and he'll meditate. But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate. As the young men move out into the battle zone. He feels good, with God you're never alone. He feels tired and he lays on his bed. Hopes the men will find courage in the words that he said. Sky pilot.....sky Pilot. How high can you fly. You'll never, never, never reach the sky. You're soldiers of God you must understand. The fate of your country is in your young hands. May God give you strength. Do your job real well. If it all was worth it. Only time it will tell. In the morning they return. With tears in their eyes. The stench of death drifts up to the skies. A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot. Remembers the words. ""Thou shalt not kill"". Sky pilot.....sky pilot. How high can you fly. You never, never, never reach the sky."

Should be the star of a Hollywood movie.... But there I was..... I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings.. I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world,. In front of every kind of girl.... There was long ones, tall ones, short ones,. Brown ones, black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones.... Out of the middle, came a lady,. She whispered in my ear something crazy,. She said.... ""Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,"". I thought to myself what could that mean?. Am I going crazy or is this just a dream?. Now, wait a minute,. I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere,. So it's all in my head,. And then...I heard her say one more time.... ""Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,"". I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back. As she disappeared, but soon she returned.. In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass.. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass,. And raised it to her lips,. And just before she drank it, she said.... ""Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,. Spill the wine and take that pearl,"". (Burdon)."

story of bo diddley,"Now lets hear the story of Bo Diddley and the Rock n Roll scene in general. Bo Diddley was born Elias McDaniels in a place called McCoom,. Missississipi about 1926. He moved to Chicago about 1938. Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley. He practiced the guitar everyday and sometimes into the night. Till his papa's hair began to turn white. His Pa said Son, listen hear, I know. You can stay but that guitar has just gotta go. So he pulled his hat down over his eyes. Headed out for them Western Skies. I think Bob Dylan said that. He hit New York City. He began to play at the Apollo in Harlem. Good scene there everybody raving. One day, one night, came a Cadillac with four head lights. Came a man with a big, long, fat, cigar said, C'mere son, I'm gonna make you a. star. Bo Diddley said, Uh..whats in it for me?. Man said, Shut your mouth son , play the guitar and you just wait and. see. Well, that boy made it, he made it real big. And so did the rest of the rock n roll scene along with him. And a white guy named Johnny Otis took Bo Diddleys rhythm. He changed it into hand-jive and it went like this. In a little old country town one day. A little old country band began to play. Add two guitars and a beat up saxophone. When the drummer said, boy, those cats begin to roam. Oh baby oh we oh oh. Ooh la la that rock and roll. Ya hear me oh we oh oh. Ooh la la that rock and roll. Then in the U.S. music scene there was big changes made. Due to circumstances beyond our control such as payola. The rock n roll scene died after two years of solid rock and you got discs like,. ah.... Take good care of my baby. Please don't ever make her blue and so forth. About, ah, one year later in a place called Liverpool in England. Four young lads with mop haircuts began to sing stuff like, ah.... It's been a hard days night and I;ve been working like a dog and so on. In a place called Richmond in Surrey, whay down in the deep south. They got guys with long hair down their back singing. I wanna be your lover baby I wanna be your man yeah and all that jazz. Now we've doing this number, Bo Diddley, for quite some time now. Bo Diddley visited this country last year. We were playing at the Club A Gogo in Newcastle, our home town. The doors opened one night and to our surprise walked in the man himself, Bo. Diddley. Along with him was Jerome Green, his maraca man, and the Duchess, his gorgeous. sister. And a we were doing this number. Along with them came the Rolling Stones, the Mersey Beats,. They're all standing around diggin' it. And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'. He turned around to Jermone Green. And he said, Hey, Jerome? What do you think these guys doin' our..our. material?. Jerome said, Uh, where's the bar, man? Please show me to the bar.... He turned around the Duchess. And he said, Hey Duchess...what do you think of these young guys doin' our. material?. She said, I don't know. I only came across here to see the changin' of the. guards and all that jazz.. Well, Bo Diddley looked up and said to me, with half closed eyes and a smile,. He said Man, took off his glasses,. He said, Man, that sure is the biggest load of rubbish I ever heard in my. life.... Hey Bo Diddley. Oh Bo Diddley. Yeah Bo Diddley. Oh Bo Diddley. Yeah Bo Diddley."

the black plague,"ohohohohoh. (gregorian chants). the bell tolls. the black plague has struck. diseased eyes roll upwards. as if knowing which direction their souls will travel. (bring out your dead). a woman in black cries. as the deathly procession passes by. and monks moan en masse. ohohohohohoh. (gregorian chants). the yet clean peasant pounds upon the castle door. for it is safer inside the walls. their knocking pounds a dull tone across the quiet, deserted courtyard. the bodies of unfortuates bloat in the hot sun outside the castle walls. and ones ignorant of all facts plunder the diseased corpses for remaining riches.. (bring out your dead). and the bell tolls on. a man walks around the castle walls on the outside. the light from his lamp dancing shadows as he moves. he tends the sick. gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man. but he feels it most for the children. (unclean). tears glisten on his cheek. did man ever deserve this death?. and not all will die, just the poor. for the rich are inside the castle walls. and he knows he could be with them. and they laugh at this fool of a man. through the stone fortress windows. and the bell tolls on. (unclean). and many deaths and many days later. many tears have been cry cried but in vain. for tears can never erase the pain of death. only time has that talent. his hands are now blistered but this man walks on. the only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all. and the bell tolls on inside the castle wall. (bring out your dead). the dead are now buried and the plague is at its end. life for the people flowers again. they breathe fresh air like they did once before. and there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls. the bell has stopped. and only silence is heard. and the peasants outside wonder what happened within. in their bones they feel something is wrong. the bell has been silent much too long. for many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live. no one came and no one went. fear can do many strange things. and even though water ran low. their mouths burnt and bellys caked dry. not one person put a foot outside. no one had that much courage. for they feared the peasants and their world outside. so they played it safe and didn't move. but one by one they perished and died."

the house of the rising sun,"There is a house in New Orleans. They call it The Rising Sun. And it's been the ruin of many other poor boys. And god, I know, I'm one. My mother was a tailor. She sewed my new blue jeans. My father was a gamblin' man. Down in New Orleans. And the only thing a gambler needs is. A suitcase and a trunk. And the only time he'll be satisfied. Is when he's on a drunk. Oh mother, tell your children. Not to do what I have done. Spend your lives in sin and misery. In the house of the rising sun. Well I've got one foot on the platform.

the immigrant lad,"And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I. And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I. As a child I dreamed of her, on the far banks of the river. I knew she could not be reached, for my mind was forever wondering. Far above his head, as he tried his best to teach me. The river was muddy and black, black as the coal she carried. Impossible to cross, many men had tried. The old sailor told me, another life is lost. And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I. And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I. Black was the colour of my childish dreams, impressions that would last. Black coal, coal black pit yacka's face, escaping the coal dust blast. Blind pony stumblin' to the light of day, to retire in the green fields forever. And I'll build me a bridge of steel, to beat the black river forever. I'll beat that black river forever, I'll beat that muddy river forever. And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I. And here I sit with a tear in my eye, the waters of Tyne in between you and I. Conversation in a London Bar:. Cockney: I don't know why you geezers come down to London all the time, 'cause you look so miserable all the time, y'know..

the story of bo diddley,"Now lets hear the story of Bo Diddley. And the Rock n Roll scene in general. Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels. In a place called McCoom, Missississipi about 1926. He moved to Chicago about 1938. Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley. He practiced the guitar everyday and sometimes into the night. Till his papa's hair began to turn white. His Pa said ""Son, listen hear, I know. You can stay but that guitar has just gotta go"". So he pulled his hat down over his eyes. Headed out for them Western Skies. I think Bob Dylan said that. He hit New York City. He began to play at the Apollo in Harlem. Good scene there everybody raving. One day, one night, came a Cadillac with four head lights. Came a man with a big, long, fat, cigar said,. ""C'mere son, I'm gonna make you a star"". Bo Diddley said, ""Uh..whats in it for me?"". Man said, ""Shut your mouth son,. play the guitar and you just wait and see"". Well, that boy made it, he made it real big. And so did the rest of the rock n roll scene along with him. And a white guy named Johnny Otis took Bo Diddleys rhythm. He changed it into hand-jive and it went like this. In a little old country town one day. A little old country band began to play. Add two guirtars and a beat up saxophone. When the drummer said, boy, those cats begin to roam. Oh baby oh we oh oh. Ooh la la that rock and roll. Ya hear me oh we oh oh. Ooh la la that rock and roll. Then in the U.S. music scene there was big changes made. Due to circumstances beyond our control such as payola. The rock n roll scene died after two years of solid rock. And you got discs like, ah.... Take good care of my baby. Please don't ever make her blue and so forth. About, ah, one year later in a place called Liverpool in England. Four young lads with mop haircuts began to sing stuff like, ah.... It's been a hard days night and I've been working like a dog and so on. In a place called Richmond in Surrey, whay down in the deep south. They got guys with long hair down their back singing. I wanna be your lover baby I wanna be your man yeah and all that jazz. Now we've doing this number, Bo Diddley, for quite some time now. Bo Diddley visited this country last year. We were playing at the Club A Gogo in Newcastle, our home town. The doors opened one night and to our surprise. W alked in the man himself, Bo Diddley. Along with him was Jerome Green, his maraca man,. And the Duchess, his gorgeous sister. And a we were doing this number. Along with them came the Rolling Stones, the Mersey Beats,. They're all standing around diggin' it. And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'. He turned around to Jermone Green. And he said, ""Hey, Jerome? What do you think these guys. Doin' our..our material?"". Jerome said, ""Uh, where's the bar, man? Please show me to the bar..."". He turned around the Duchess. And he said, ""Hey Duchess...what do you think of these young guys. Doin' our material?"". She said, ""I don't know. I only came across here. To see the changin' of the guards and all that jazz."". Well, Bo Diddley looked up and said to me,. With half closed eyes and a smile,. He said ""Man,"" took off his glasses,. He said, ""Man, that sure is the biggest load of rubbish. I ever heard in my life..."". Hey Bo Diddley. Oh Bo Diddley. Yeah Bo Diddley. Oh Bo Diddley. Yeah Bo Diddley."
