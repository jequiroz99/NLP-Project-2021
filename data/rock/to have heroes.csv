better day,"All apologies my dear, I know you feel like I’m not here. and part of me is missing all the time. I only give you half of me cuz I’m afraid the rest of me. will scare you into leaving me behind. So I keep my secrets to keep us safe. I did a lot of things and I just don’t know what to say. I made mistakes that baby I can never take away. I want to tell you everything but I think we would change. So I will wait, wait for a Better Day. With everything I keep from you, you might think I don’t love you. but nothing could be further from the truth. I just want things to stay the same, they probably will the more I wait. But if we don’t talk I’m gonna fall away from you. But I keep my secrets to keep us safe. I did a lot of things and I just don’t know what to say. I made mistakes that baby I can never take away. I want to tell you everything but I think we would change. So I will wait, wait for a Better Day. I know it’s not right but I’ll keep hiding anyway. All these things I know I should say but baby I’m afraid. I did a lot of things and I just don’t know what to say. I made mistakes that baby I can never take away. I want to tell you everything but I think we would change. So I will wait, wait for a Better Day"
don't give up on us,"Stay until the morning and maybe you’ll forget. Try hard to remember how we were when we first met. Is that feeling still there?. A part of you must still care. Don’t give up on us quite yet. I know right now it hurts but don’t believe the part of you that says it just won’t work. What we had back then is still enough. So don’t give up on us. All these memories they sting. Nothing left to hold on to. Like a firework on new years day but we’ll never light the fuse. There used to be so much to say, now we’re just passing through the days. Trying hard to get it back. Don’t give up on us quite yet. I know right now it hurts but don’t believe the part of you that says it just won’t work. What we had back then is still enough. So don’t give up on us. I hate the hard times to but I know I belong right here with you. Please believe that too. So don’t give up on us quite yet. I know right now it hurts but don’t believe the part of you that’s had enough. Don’t give up on us quite yet. I know right now it hurts but don’t believe the part of you that says it just won’t work. What we had back then is still enough. So don’t give up on us"
fairweather friend,Fairweather friend it took me too long to find out what I was in for. Fairweather friend I just can’t wait for you to change your mind. And it’s alright if you stay with me tonight. Until the rain passes by. I’m giving it all away. I never really held your pain. Because you never let me in all the way. I gave you the best of me. It’s time that we both see. Maybe it’s better to just let it end. Fairweather Friend. How many times will you fold all your things up packing with subtle indifference. And all that we dreamt of was everything. Waiting until we could leave. And it’s alright if you stay with me tonight. Until the rain passes by. I’m giving it all away. I never really held your pain. Because you never let me in all the way. I gave you the best of me. It’s time that we both see. Maybe it’s better to just let it end. Fairweather Friend. I’m growing old waiting for you to come around. I’m breaking down. You’re taking it all away. I never had the time to say. Leave it all behind us. It’d never be the same. I’m giving it all away. I never really held your pain. Because you never let me in all the way. I gave you the best of me. It’s time that we both see. Maybe it’s better to just walk away. Maybe it’s better to just let it end. Fairweather Friend
reasons,"Come back for another day with me. Come back, you’ll never want to leave. Just give it all up, just take a knee and you’ll see. The pictures on the wall don’t look the same. On the outside the snow has turned to rain. You’re packing up ever thing we have. You said you might be back. You’ll never go right if you’re always wrong. You take it with a grain of what ever comes along. Well you’re leaving on my favorite season. I just hope you have your reasons. The cold is gone, the grass is turning green. Did you find out if what’s there is what you need?. Get back, get back where you belong just like you were never gone. A reason to pretend. A reason it won’t end. That’s what I keep holding on to. A reason you’ll get tired and remember what we had. A reason to come back"
the story of your life,Every story has a writer who’s life has been inspired by love or a desire. To get inside of the mind of the reader or at least get to the next page. Every movie has a part where they get to the heart of the matter. Foreshadowing what might be happening. Whether or not there’s a trap door in the floor of the stage. So I’m trying to read. Cause I’m dying to see. Who I will be…. In the story of your life. Where will I be. If you close the book tonight. Am I the hero or the villian. Is it a history or fiction. Will I still be here in the end. In the story of your life. In the story of your life. In the novel I am writing. I’ve decided I am using the actual identities. Instead of misleading the people I love. Cause they're the ones who need it the most. And every chapter is another beginning. And I’m beginning to guess my character’s in way over his head. Cause of something he said or maybe something he wrote. So I’m trying to read. Cause I’m dying to see. Who I will be…. In the story of your life. Where will I be. If you close the book tonight. Am I the hero or the villain. Is it a history or fiction. Will I still be here in the end. In the story of your life. Tell me Juliet. Can we make it through this act. Without a tragedy. Oh let’s get through this scene. Cause I’m dying to see. If I will be. In the story of your life. Where will I be. If you close the book tonight. Who will I be. In the story of your life. Where will I be. If you wrote the book tonight. Who will I be…... In the story of your life. In the story of your life
