Snipers posted bills -- as they should -- of our midnight vacation. Back on the planet now -- I'm beginning to see just how. Echelon your dreams and they'll come true. Type slowly. One of us is a cigar stand --. and one of us is a lovely blue incandescent guillotine. The edge of creation is blurred and blushed. Not a lot of room to grow inside this leather terrarium. People of the bay -- it is excruciatingly gray. Face the front when he comes for you. Type slowly. Cherish your memorized weakness. Fashioned from a manifesto -- lady, I am no futurist. I'm my only critic, I. Trolls in the glen are consorting again. The liberals say they don't exist but I know that they do. Reinforce your literal ass -- hit it on the first or second pass. Frozen images, respected few. Type slowly."

unseen power of the picket fence,"Some bands I like to name check,. And one of them is REM,. Classic songs with a long history. Southern boys just like you and me.. REM. Flashback to 1983,.

You were born to be a camera,. Time After Time was my least favourite song,. Time After Time was my least favourite song.. The singer, he had long hair. And the drummer he knew restraint.. And the bass man he had all the right moves. And the guitar player was no saint.. So lets go way back to the ancient times. When there were no 50 states,. And on a hill there stands Sherman. Sherman and his mates.. And they're marching through Georgia,. we're marching through Georgia,. we're marching through Georgia. G-G-G-G-Georgia. They're marching through Georgia,. we're marching through Georgia,. marching through Georgia. G-G-G-G-Georgia. and there stands REM"
we are underused,"Out beyond the call of duty --. hold your instincts hostage and stick near me. Let's drink a toast -- it's the most I can stand to cry about.
