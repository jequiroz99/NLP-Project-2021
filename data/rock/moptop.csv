i tried so hard,"I tried so hard. I, I tried to say I tried to stay. I'm not sure I want to try. I can find someone who feels the same as I. Someone else who believes in the sun. And who says that when you're feeling like you need a break. I'll be calling out your name. I'm not sure you really know one day baby. I, I went away I made my ways. I'm so sorry I tried my best to believe in the sun. Than who says that when you're feeling like you need a break. I'll be calling out your name. When you're hoping for a change. I'll be there you know. Today and in the end and maybe even when. we both are dead. 'cause baby I tried so hard. I know we'll meet again. when you're feeling like you need a break. I'll be calling out your name. When you're hoping for a change. I'll be there you know. Today and in the end and maybe even when. we both are dead. 'cause baby I tried so hard. I know we'll meet again"
rock and roll,I made her feel so confused. I made her feel like she should. I made her feel like I cared. But all of those times I lied. And all of those times I left. And all of those things I broke. And all of those things I said. Remember the love we shared. Remember the love we had. Remember the things you said. Remember the songs. I say we rock I say we roll. I say we rock to the dead and gone beneath the sun. I say we rock I say we roll
superstar,Jessie was a young girl dreamin’ in her young girl room. Daddy when I’m older I’m going to be a superstar. (But she) I wonder if she’s ready for. When love comes knocking at her door. Believe me things weren’t meant this way. That’s all the time we have today. I know its all a joke I wonder if you know. She believes she wants to be a star. She is million dollar superstar. With a million dollar gold guitar. But with a million other things to say. On the cover of a magazine. Jessie you’re a beauty queen. As was written on a wall somewhere. Beware of what you dream for girl. Johnny was young boy playing on his new guitar. Heavy metal posters tell us what he really wants. (But he) I wonder if he’s ready for. When love comes knocking at his door. Believe me things weren’t meant this way. That’s all the time we have today. I know its all a joke I wonder if you know. He believes he wants to be a star
