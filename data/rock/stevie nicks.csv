leather and lace (feat. don henley),Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow. Shatter with words impossible to follow. You're saying I'm fragile I try not to be. I search only for something I can't see. I have my own life. And I am stronger than you know. But I carry this feeling. When you walked into my house. That you won't be walking out the door (2x). Lovers forever -- face to face. My city or mountains. Stay with me stay. I need you to love me. I need you today. Give to me your leather. Take from me my lace. You in the moonlight. With your sleepy eyes. Could you ever love a man like me. And you were right. When I walked into your house. I knew I'd never want to leave. Sometimes I'm a strong man. Sometimes cold and scared. And sometimes I cry. But that time I saw you. I knew with you to light my nights. Somehow I'd get by (2x). (Chorus) 2x

And if he followed me home,. will the sound of both of our voices simply disappear?. Well, I miss you now.... He laughs. He has an attitude so I have an attitude, too. He knocks on the door next to the courtyard. Well, he frightens me so, I let him in. But I'm already, well, I'm already screaming. How can the greatest love come from the greatest pain?"

every day,"Don't keep me hangin' on a string. Tell me what I feel is no big thing. Don't Turn away I'm Listening. Over and over again. Don't give me visions to explain. There are no doubts I feel the strain. Of all my senses yearning. Over and over again. Every day I see you. Every day I need you. Every way I breath you. On and on and on and on again. its not important to wonder why. What is just is no more imply. This simple thought repeating. Over and over again. Every day I see you. Every day I need you. Every way I breath you. On and on and on and on again. Imaging all the ways to cope. I close my eyes, that gives my hope. It cures the silence. Every day I see you. Every day I need you.

everybody loves you,She was so enticed. By his smile. She was so unaffected. By his dream. For his dream of her. Was just not possible. She was so not that girl. It was just one of those things. That happened or didn't happen. A strand of golden hair tangled. Like the words of a song. Like a spider's web. And then he said. Everybody loves you. But you're so alone. Everybody knows your name. But you can't find your way home. No one really knows you. I'm the only one. She was so enchanted by his voice. She was so shaken by his words. His plan for her. Was just not possible. She had no words. Ooh it isn't just that. We cause each other such pain. Everywhere we go now. At home or on stage. Sometimes it was heavenly. Sometimes it was too heavy. I looked the other way. Everybody loves you. But you're so alone. Everybody knows your name. But you can't find your way home. No one really knows you. I'm the only one. Don't come here again. Unless fear of fire leaves you cold. And the cold makes you tired. If you feel it all. It's all about desire. About when you were true. About a bird on a wire. And that was you. She does still hear him. All night long. The same song over and over. It heals her heart. No voice of a stranger. Could play that part. It broke her heart. Broke her heart. Everybody loves you. But you're so alone. Everybody knows your name. But you can't find your way home. Everybody loves you. But you're so alone. Everybody knows your name. But you can't find your way home. No one really knows you. I'm the only one
fall from grace,"I choose to be his confidant. And to keep him from the fire. I choose to be quietly discreet. If that is his desire. I touch with gossamer wings. To be quiet around you. There is so much going on. You could easily. [Chorus:]. Wake up with a stranger. It's not something you plan. One night in a world of pain. And you finally understand. Not all the king's horses, not all the king's men. Could put it back together. You say you wouldn't do this for very long. The applause from it all is so defining. Well it bounces off the wall at you. When the miracle is happening. High priestess... she's the keeper of the peace in this. Twice as much, intensified. What people will do. To get... this... high. [Chorus]. And now alone in my room. As it all begins again. Was I so wrong. Why am I always so intense. In this same place I sit. The same place as before. Well I came all the way here. Just to watch you walk out that door. I didn't ask when you shook your head. I always accepted what you said. As the truth and the truth only. Well it's not enough that you depend on me. And it's not enough that you say you love me. It's not enough to just save face. Because sometimes. You just fall from grace. Sometimes. You just fall from grace. Maybe I am calmer now. Maybe things are fine. Maybe I made the whole thing up. Maybe it isn't a lie. Maybe the reason I say these things. Is to bring you back alive. Maybe I fought this long and this hard. Just to make sure you survive. Just to make sure you survive"

garbo,I love to waltz with a man in a dark linen suit. All alone -- at a party with someone I knew. From a time gone by -- turned to stone. You could be Garbo or even Marlene. You could be Marilyn.... Or you could forget. I play the part but then all of us do. And I do it so well as I do it to you. In this town full of strangers. In this town full of fools. Venus doesn't glitter when she stands next to you. When you're waltzing through stardom. You miss what you lose. Lose yourself in a silvery dress. For you think you must do what you feel you do best. And you musn't give it up for you're still but a guest. You could be Garbo or even Marlene.... Or you could forget.
gold,"When the lights go down. In the California town. People are in for the evening. I jump into my car. And I throw in my guitar. My heart beatin' time with the breathing. Driving over Kanan. Singing to my soul. 'Cause people out there turn the music into gold. My buddy Jim Bash. He is working pumping gas. And he makes two fifty for an hour. He's got rhythm in his hands. As he's tapping in the cans. Sings rock and roll in the shower. California girls are the prettiest in the world. Each one a song in the making. Singin' rhymes with me, I can hear the melody. Story is there for the taking."

In his heart he wishes her stardom. His eyes want for her much more. That's not so different. Than the way that he said. ""There are so very few stars left"". ?. Don't hide behind your hair. It's a bit of gold and braid. Easy come the tears. You see a pathway ending with a doorway. You slip toward the doorway. Been waiting there all day. All these years. ?. Don't hide it. In his heart he wishes to forget her. Like to make it better. And hold her like a child. ?. Don't hide your eyes that way. Don't hide anything not anymore. Because I never did not love you. I never did run from you. In a dream I said to you. That I'd always love you"

Before our infamous pasts had begun. You have to let him go. He gives such hard advice, oh. He gives such hard advice. He says don? t think twice. Turn off the radio. It was finished long ago.

Lovers forever -- face to face. My city or mountains. Stay with me stay. I need you to love me. I need you today. Give to me your leather. Take from me my lace. You in the moonlight. With your sleepy eyes. Could you ever love a man like me. And you were right. When I walked into your house. I knew I'd never want to leave. Sometimes I'm a strong man. Sometimes cold and scared. And sometimes I cry. But that time I saw you. I knew with you to light my nights. Somehow I'd get by (2x). (Chorus) 2x

Love's a hard game to play. No matter what they say. Win or lose, no matter what they say. Love's a hard game to play. The problem here is not my fear. The trouble is you can't convince yourself. For tonight, let's lose the past. Make love last. Put our worries up on the shelf. We've been through thick and thin, and back again. And we can endure love's sweet pain. Remember, starting the fire is easy. The hardest part is learning how to keep the flame. Love's like walking a real fine line. You get too close and you'll go blind. Let go too long and it will all drift away. [Chorus]. Just when I feel like I'm losin' you. I hear them voices call. They say it's better to have lost at love. Than never to have loved at all. Lose or win, stand or fall. Well, there's more to love than makin' time. The harder you look, the more you'll find. It's never easy, no matter what they say"

And I learned to say the words. Well, just whose side are you on, anyway?. You change sides. What does it matter?. Still you change... Sides. Every other day you just change sides. So, continue on your destructive road. Your life passes before me. Like an unknown circumstance. You and your friend are at odds. And you are not winning. But why does someone always have to win?.
