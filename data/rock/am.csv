a complete unknown,In the hallway. A seed was sewn. Into the mind of a complete unknown. Then a story. Which was never known. Rose to the surface. And soon took hold. Like a battle. You just can't win. What you've kept out. You now let in. And the secrets of a convenient friend. Bringing you back. Again and again. Back and fourth from what you think is right. Time could heal the things you feel tonight. So wake up. Put on a new face. Following through. With agreements made. But a feeling. You just can't name. Is taking control. Of what you do and say. Back and fourth from what you think is right. Time could heal the things you feel tonight. Roads signal decay. When you're torn between your words. You cannot be saved. This is something you own. You won't get no sympathy. Try if you want but it won't be free. From the shadows. You just can't see. Desire and need. Almost never agree
city boy (feat. shawn lee),sit in back rows. with nothing to say. born into headphones. running away. you needed someone. to turn you around. you couldn't make it alone. come get what you wanted. there's nothing denied. you're at the center. of everyone's eye. places we're going. you wouldn't believe. you are my ultimate prize. in the light. city boy is blind. wanted for your style. silly boy you. now you'll be my lady. living in my city. i'm waiting now my lady. it's time for you to pay your dues. in the light. city boy is blind. wanted for your style. i'm waiting for you
city syndrome,Looking out at the city so bright. Not sure if it’s imagined or real. Show me something that you’d always want to hide. And then we’ll get away. You always wanted to say what you feel. But all those right hands keep telling you wrong. Got another who’s just stepping on your heels. Got to get away. Get away from. All these troubled and all of these lies. Find yourself a reason. Leave tonight. Take your chances. Feeling alright. And then we’ll fade away. Fade away tonight. Helpless highways looking alone. Seen nothing but the worst of your times. All in all it ‘s got you climbing up the walls. You gotta get away. Get away from. All these troubled and all of these lies. Find yourself a reason. Leave tonight. Take your chances. Feeling alright. And then we’ll fade away. Fade away tonight
dark into light (feat. shawn lee),what's your name. do you feel the same. up all night. think about our lives. when we're gone. our ghosts live on. so have we tried. have we done our best. to turn the wrong into right. turn the wrong into right. turn the dark into light. we divide. sacrifice our lives. over what we're told. over what they hide. we don't want. to go unsung. give us your faith. cuz it's not too late. to turn the wrong into right. turn the wrong into right. turn the dark into light. light. light. light. and we'll be alright. right. right. right. right. right. right. right
gone away,I sit around. Nothing?s the same. I?m looking for answers. But I?m already late. You say you need me. One more night'. Then you?re packing your bags. Saying it?s all right. I don?t know why. I wait and I wait. I?m looking for something. But you?re not gonna change. Turn around and I see the hope fading. Now you?ve gone away. Keep on moving like you?re so unaware. You?re looking for answers but you?re already there. You see the road but you don?t the way. You?re coming around and then you?re pulling away. i don?t know why I wait and I wait. I?m looking for something but you?re not gonna change. Turn around and I see the hope fading. Now you?ve gone away
home,Waiting for the sun to rise. Was it something I said. Feeling all that is right and wrong. Mixing up in my head. Won’t you just let me come around. Cuz you know that I can. Bring me back to just what I know. A home. I’m alone. All troubled pass in time. And we can make it through. You tell me that it’s not what I say. But what I can do. I can’t make it alone. I want to come home. Blinded by these city lights. Now they just got in the way. And it’s so lonely this evening town. It makes no sense anyway. Now it’s what you say that I’m riding on. Cuz all those times I let you down. You were there to stay. All troubles pass in time. And we can make it through. You tell me that it’s not what I say. But what I can do. I can’t make it alone. I want to come home
losing you,"I saw a road that had no end. I wanted you. So I followed it. And what you take is what you should give. But the stories came. And the stories went. I gave so much of myself to you. But that’s alright. I wanted to. Nothing learned, don’t know what to do. There’s no lesson here. I’m losing you. Now you wanted nothing we talked about. I thought I had. You figured out. I had so much to give you now. I was sure of you. But you had your doubts. Now don’t you worry you’re not to blame. I’ve been on your side. Playing those games. Now you’re just in a different place. There’s nothing left. Let’s walk away"
running away,Did I tell you I knew your name. But it seems that I've lost it. Did I tell you it's my own game. This is not your problem. I don't know if I'm gonna change. Wasting time and another day. I keep running away. Even from the good things. Did I tell you it's not that bad. Sitting over here dreaming. Did I tell you Im right on track. This time I mean it. I don't know if I'm gonna change. Wasting time and another day. I keep running away. Even from the good things
somebody like you (feat. shawn lee),don't you know that i need somebody. need somebody like you. don't you know that i need somebody. need somebody that's true. it's a miracle you need someone. you need someone too. cuz i know that i need somebody. need somebody like you. and you know we all need somebody. need someone to make it through. in the end we all leave somebody. so love someone until you do
troubled times,Waiting. You sit alone. Feelings have all faded. You're wondering why you have stayed. You're looking for some answers. Hoping there's some other way. Just tell me when you're ready. We'll get you far far away. Far from these troubled times. Looking at the way you stand and fall. Seems like everything you've had is gone. Tell me that you've heard this all before. I'll say it anyway. Leave this. You've seen that road. Just find another city. Get this out of your way. You're hiding out wondering. How to get rid of this pain. You talk a bunch of nothing. Seems so easy to see. You've seen enough troubled times
