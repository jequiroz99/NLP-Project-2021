alien,"I ain't no model, I ain't no star. Ain't gonna make the headlines through divorce scams. I'm kind of ugly, but I get by. I'm no Prince Charming, just an urban caveman. I'm not so cool and I ain't that sharp. I'm just a clown fish fighting the great white sharks. I feel so jaded, I feel so aimless. Worse than a blind nun praying at a swinger conference. No, no, not again. I don't wanna play this endlessly. I don't feel I'm ready to give in. I don't wanna play this endlessly. And everything will stay the same. And we will play the game again. Just leave your troubles far away. And it will all be fine again. I'm used to swimming against the tide. Don't want no sheepish monkeys by my side. The truth is out there for all to see. The latest fad is saving up to pierce your knee. I'm going bald and losing all my locks. The fight is lost against the ticking of the clocks. I feel so jaded, I feel so aimless. Worse than a blind nun swaying at a hooker contest. No, no, not again. I don't wanna play this endlessly. I don't feel I'm ready to give in. I don't wanna play this endlessly. And everything will stay the same. And we will play the game again. Just leave your troubles far away. And it will all be fine again. And everything will stay the same. Let's have a beer and celebrate. Just leave your troubles far away. And it will all be fine again. Mother-ship come look for me. Mother-ship please rescue me. Mother-ship come set me free. And everything will stay the same. And we will play the game again. Just leave your troubles far away. And it will all be fine again. And everything will stay the same. Let's have a beer and celebrate. Just leave your troubles far away. And it will all be fine again"
angel,"I read the news today, oh boy. And just wanted to crawl away like a cockroach. Almost being crushed underfoot. But hiding underground don't do any good. Be my angel, please help me mamacita. I'll mind my manners and eat my greens. Keep my mind more clean. Be less skeptical. And just let it flow. It's you who never sleeps. To keep my dreams alive. It's you who never blinks. To keep me in your sight. It's you who never sleeps. To keep my dreams alive. It's you. I walked the streets today, oh boy. I'd rather live the life of a hermit. And go hide to make it right. Then emerge and come out into the light. Be my angel, please help me mona lisa. I promise to have more of a clue. Read a book or two. See less tv shows. Look for ufo s. It's you who never sleeps. To keep my dreams alive. It's you who never blinks. To keep me in your sight. It's you who never sleeps. To keep my dreams alive. It's you. There's no break, there's no recess. There's no strike, no truce, no rest. Always talking in your head. It's you who never sleeps. To keep my dreams alive. It's you who never blinks. To keep me in your sight. It's you who never sleeps. To keep my dreams alive. It's you"
dynamite,"All my life I was on your track. And all I got was an aching back. A ghost in drag came in my room. She said ""close your eyes to see the bloom"". Lightning bolts from underground. I lost the end, I was out of bounds. Extra spicy dynamite. A crispy taste in every bite. Come set me on fire. Just set me on fire. Walls, may they burn on down. Let's walk on the wire. Step on to the wire. Just dancing above the ground. All my life I've been so numb. Endless thoughts like rolling drums. I slammed the door, I shut'em down. I sent'em back to tinsel town. Spinning wheels along the line. Firecrackers up my spine. Extra spicy pepper sauce. Navigation; changing course. Come set me on fire. Just set me on fire. Walls, may they burn on down. Let's walk on the wire. Step on to the wire. Just dancing above the ground. You can stop pretending. You may start surrendering. If you're here it's not far. To become what you are. Come set me on fire. Just set me on fire. Walls, may they burn on down. Let's walk on the wire. Step on to the wire. Just dancing above the ground"

'cause. Everything is under control, control, control. Everyday is new but I'm old, now I'm sold, yeah I'm sold. Everything is under control, control, control. . When I look into your eyes.
