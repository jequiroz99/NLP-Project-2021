be somebody,"I'm just the boy inside the man. Not exactly who you think I am. Trying to trace my steps back here again. So many times. I'm just a speck inside your head. You came and made me who I am. I remember where it all began. So clearly. I feel a million miles away. Still you connect me in your way. And you create in me. Something I would've never seen. When I could only see the floor. You made my window a door. So when they say they don't believe. I hope that they see you in me. After all the lights go down. I'm just the words you are the sound. A strange type of chemistry. How you've become a part of me. And when I sit alone at night. Your thoughts burn through me like a fire. You're the only one who knows who I really am. We all wanna be somebody. We just need a taste of who we are. We all wanna be somebody. We're willing to go but not that far. And we're all see through, just like glass. And we can shatter just as fast. That light's been burned out for a while. I still see it every time I pass. It was lost in the corners of my mind. Behind a box of reasons why. I never doubted it was there. It just took a little time to find. (And even when). I feel a million miles away. Still you connect me in your way. And you create in me something.

If we can just learn to believe. We had a plan. To build a wall. A great divide that would never fall. To separate us. From all the pain. And keep the skeletons locked away. And brick by brick. We built it so thick. That it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight. And one by one. We all became numb. We were making the bullets to a broken gun. If I could just see it all.

I wanna be so far gone in you. So far nothing else will ever do. I wanna be so far gone in you. In you. I've stood alone and I've fallen down. Your hands were there to pick me off the ground.

all i need to know,You could read a million pages. Know the words in all the phrases. You could try to turn a lie into the truth. And you can live to be a hundred. Memorizing every number. You could even put a man on the moon. And the science of the heart is sometimes lost on me. But I'm following this feeling. I don't know why. It's so hard to swallow our pride. And I don't know how many wrongs make a right. I don't know the reason. Sometimes it just feels so good to cry. And I don't know which way the wind will blow. But you're here with me. And that's all I need to know. There's a moment in the morning. When I feel the most alone. But then I hear your voice whispering my name. It's like a wave of understanding. And I never could have planned it. Where the questions and doubts all fade away. I don't know why. It's so hard to swallow our pride. And I don't know how many wrongs make a right. I don't know the reason. Sometimes it just feels so good to cry. And I don't know which way the wind will blow. But you're here with me. And that's all I need to know. I figured it out. Just turn me around at the speed of light. All that I ever needed to know. Was in your eyes. I don't know why. It's so hard to swallow our pride. And I don't know how many wrongs make a right. I don't know the reason. Sometimes it just feels so good to cry. And I don't know which way the wind will blow. But you're here with me. And that's all I need to know. That's all I need to know. That's all I need to know. All I need to know

Take me to a place where doors are open,. A lovely little place where no one’s broken,. Welcome to the world that no one’s livin’,. Just wanna break out and escape this prison,. [Chorus]. Bring me to life. Breathe air into me,. It’s taken me my whole life to realize,. All the things I’ve never seen,. Bring me to life. Breathe air into me,. Take me from the darkness that I feel,. ‘Cause I just wanna be free,. Bring me to life! Bring me to life!. Come on start your engines. Flip that switch,. And take you to the limit if you ride like this,. And if you feel alive then pump your fists,. ‘Cause there’s no turnin’ back, when the energy hits,. Down comes the rain like a hurricane,. Hard to breathe like a storm hangin’ over me,. Comin’ to get me but I don’t have to let it in,. I stand up - face my fears like an enemy,. [Chorus]. And I’ve been wanting to break out,. You helped me figure out,. That I could come to life,. And turn this thing around, (x2). Just shut it if you’re talkin’ to me,. I’m sick and tired of all the lies,. And what you want me to be, (x4). What you want me to be,. [Chorus]"
in my room,"They say that you created all. My voice my sounds so small. And between heavens walls. What they set you in my mind. And they say that your love has no end. And that you can heal the past. With just one touch of your hand. Doesn't matter if I was to blame. I've been trying to erase myself. But trying to be someone else. They say there's no hope for me. I guess this must be hell. They make me feel so empty. Their words they cut like knives. You tell me to forgive them. But not sure I'll survive. I'm not sure this is a good time. Or even if your home. It's a long long way from your throne. But can you meet me in my room. A place where I feel safe. Don't have to run away. And I can just be me. Can you meet me in my room. A place where I feel strong. A place where I belong. And I can call my own. I wait for you. They say you're always there, you never leave. Even when we don't believe. And that sounds like love to me. I know I couldn't do the same. And they said that you can see my heart. Then you already know I'm falling apart. That's why I hide here in a dark. So no one has to see my pain. I've never prayed so can we just talk. Don't wanna put you on the spot. But can you bring the keys to my heart. And help me find a way. Make me feel so empty. The words they cut like knives. You tell me to forgive them. But not sure I'll survive. I'm not sure this is a good time. Or even if your home. It's a long long way from your throne. But can you meet me in my room. A place where I feel safe. Don't have to run away. And I can just be me. Can you meet me in my room. A place where I feel strong. A place where I belong. And I can call my own. I want you meet me.

i see red,"These waterfalls I've seen a million times. They wash away the world. That I've seen covering up my mind. And I can push the walls away. Untill they're out of sight and mind. But I'm not strong enough to stand alone here in this tide. I don't want to, I'm not trying. I wish it would just go away. And then I see red... I see red. I see red... I see red. These situations make me feel so cold. It's like I've been replaced by someone I don't know. And I can't say the words untill I've said all that I can say. But without you I'm a fraction of who I'm supposed to be. Breathe me in and take me under. Crack these walls and let's start again. And then I see red... I see red. I see red... I see red. I see red... I see red. I see red... I see red. We can run we can hide, we can live without it. It's the same in us, it takes the blame in us. We can love we can hate, we can live without it.

When I could only see the floor. You made my window a door. So when they say they don't believe. I hope that they see you in me. After all the lights go down. I'm just the words you are the sound. A strange type of chemistry. How you've become a part of me. And when I sit alone at night. Your thoughts burn through me like a fire. You're the only one who knows who I really am. We all wanna be somebody. We just need a taste of who we are. We all wanna be somebody. We're willing to go but not that far. And we're all see through, just like glass. And we can shatter just as fast. That light's been burned out for a while. I still see it every time I pass. It was lost in the corners of my mind. Behind a box of reasons why. I never doubted it was there. It just took a little time to find. (And even when). I feel a million miles away. Still you connect me in your way. And you create in me something. I would've never seen. When I could only see the floor. You made my window a door. So when they say they don't believe. I hope that they see you in me. After all the lights go down. I'm just the words you are the sound. A strange type of chemistry. How you've become a part of me. And when I sit alone at night. Your thoughts burn through me like a fire. You're the only one who knows who I really am. We all wanna be somebody. We just need a taste of who we are. We all wanna be somebody. We're willing to go but not that far. We all wanna be somebody. We just need a taste of who we are. We all wanna be somebody. We're willing to go but not that far. I'm just the boy inside the man. Not exactly who you think I am. Trying to trace my steps back here again. So many times. When I could only see the floor. You made my window a door. So when they say they don't believe. I hope that they see you in me"
born again,"I tried, but I just can't get out of this. It's got me tied like the waves come in. When this thing hits me, I start it again. Cause I could drown just by holdin' it in. I want it. I got it. I'm done hittin' the bottom. I can taste it I'm so close. Tired of bein' haunted. I'm an addict of habit. Don't hide me in the attic. I'm an angel if I can stay plugged in again. I've been diggin' in high and low. To find the world I know. But I can't seem to find a thing. Feel stronger now than I've ever been. So won't you let me in. I feel like I've been born again. Like a time bomb ticking at the scene of a crime. It's going down if I let it again. Blow the roof sky high like the fourth of july. I'm all or nothing if I'm lettin' it in. I want it. I got it. I'm done hittin' the bottom. I can taste it I'm so close. Tired of bein' haunted. I'm an addict of habit. Don't hide me in the attic. I'm an angel if I can stay plugged in again.

I'm not an easy target. I'm not an angel in disguise. I'm just a man that by grace. Was given a second chance. I feel like I've been born again. I know what your thinking but I just can't think it. It came alive now I'm overtaken. Thought I had it all 'till my world was shaken. I can't erase it there's no mistaking. Cause I've been diggin' in high and low. To find the world I know. But I can't seem to find a thing. Feel stronger now than I've ever been. So won't you let me in. I feel like I've been born again. I'm not an easy target. I'm not an angel in disguise. I'm just a man that by grace. Was given a second chance. I feel like I've been born again"
born this way,"Because I was born this way. I got lightning running thru my veins. Ain't nobody gonna stop this train. So hop on board, or get out the way. Because I was born this way. I got lightning running thru my veins. Ain't nobody gonna stop this train. You can't stop us, we can't be stopped. Ever since I was an infant, I spit it. Ate mics, and rocked lennon. In first grade, I drank my juice with rocks in it. Never looked down, 'cause up, had more stains in it. Always been about the heart, never cared who's winning'. Ha! ... I chase the light, like emcees on the wrong mic. My blood was the wrong type. So I had to give my life. And relearn, the minute that I felt real life. I'd rather create than follow. Welcome to the knife. Because I was born this way. I got lightning running thru my veins. Ain't nobody gonna stop this train. So hop on board, or get out the way. Because I was born this way. I got lightning running thru my veins. Ain't nobody gonna stop this train. You can't stop us, we can't be stopped. Feel that smoke rise, to the sky. Split, like a dollar sign. Flip, when ya hear that beat, rip like it's dynamite. Cold, like a winter street, loud, 'cause I wanna be. The mic is my weapon, so I spit this artillery. Ha! ... I chase the light, like emcees on the wrong mic. My blood was the wrong type, so I had to give my life. And relearn, the minute that I felt real life. I'd rather create, than follow.

breathe you in,"Taking hold, breaking in. The pressures on, need to circulate. Mesmerized and taken in. Moving slow, so it reasonates. It's time to rest, not to sleep away. My thoughts alone, try to complicate. I'll do my best, to seek you out. And be myself, not impersonate. Tried so hard to not walk away. And when things don't go my way. I'll still carry on and on just the same. I've always been strong. But can't make this happen. 'Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in. The fear of becoming. I'm so tired of running. And I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in. I want to breathe you in. I'm going in, so cover me. Your compass will, help me turn the page. The laughing stock I'll never be. Because I won't let them take me. Tried so hard to not walk away. And when things don't go my way. I'll still carry on and on just the same. I've always been strong. But can't make this happen. 'Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in. The fear of becoming. I'm so tired of running. And I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in. I want to breathe you in. Took awhile to see all the love that's around me. Through the highs and lows there's a truth that I've known. And it's You.. Yeah!. I've always been strong. But can't make this happen.

breather,"When the question never set before me. Can I feel it out once more. You are my full ambition. I walked on water. I'm sick of talking now. I want You by my side. So close that I can feel You breathing. I won't turn my head, be misguided. I need a breather. You take my breath away. Stay here just enough to catch me when I'm falling. You fill me up just like a big balloon of helium. Can't get enough I want some more come on and fill me up. When I'm with You there ain't no other place I'd rather be. I just open up and receive Him and He set me free."
bring me to life,"Open your mind don’t let it slip,. And take you on a midnight ride that’s wicked,. Everyone around it comes in feeling,. Fed up with the way their rooms are hidden,. Take me to a place where doors are open,. A lovely little place where no one’s broken,. Welcome to the world that no one’s livin’,. Just wanna break out and escape this prison,. [Chorus]. Bring me to life. Breathe air into me,. It’s taken me my whole life to realize,. All the things I’ve never seen,. Bring me to life. Breathe air into me,. Take me from the darkness that I feel,. ‘Cause I just wanna be free,. Bring me to life! Bring me to life!. Come on start your engines. Flip that switch,. And take you to the limit if you ride like this,. And if you feel alive then pump your fists,. ‘Cause there’s no turnin’ back, when the energy hits,. Down comes the rain like a hurricane,. Hard to breathe like a storm hangin’ over me,. Comin’ to get me but I don’t have to let it in,. I stand up - face my fears like an enemy,. [Chorus]. And I’ve been wanting to break out,. You helped me figure out,. That I could come to life,. And turn this thing around, (x2). Just shut it if you’re talkin’ to me,. I’m sick and tired of all the lies,. And what you want me to be, (x4). What you want me to be,. [Chorus]"

With me and my brother John. We tried so hard not to carry on. But if we're so optimistic well that one he was around. Let me know if you see him around. Let me know if you see him downtown. I know there is something better than this. I know there is. There's gotta be. I know there is something better than this. I know there is. There's gotta be. I know there. Is a place where I can just hang out. With the friends who I brang out. We can have some laughs smile and drink and have a good time. With all the people we get. Who I could never forget. La la, la la la la la la. Lotsa things that I would like to say. To you in your troubled state. But it's so hard when you're so good at keeping it to yourself. And wait till the sun comes up in the morning. If you come back we'll find a place for you"
can't stop this,"This is war, I spotted 9, maybe 10. Might've missed one by the door. The grass is high where we roar. Sometimes a rebel doesn't make an outlaw. I can see them in the distance.

You can't stop this thing we've started. Word of mouth, there's a snake in the garden. You can't stop this thing we've started. Come get it, forget it, even if you wanted. You can't stop this thing we've started. Bring it on, like a bomb, even if you wanted. You can't stop this thing we've started. This is war, and when it rains it pours. So get ready for the encore. Tension's high in the blast off. Shake up the board room. Take all the masks off. Cataclysmic, down to business. There's no fear here, no time for head tricks. 'cause now we know why we're here. Nobody's safe, get out the clear. You can't knock it, can't rock it. You can't stop this thing we started. You can't stop it, just get off it. You can't stop this thing we started"

Hold the whole world in my hands.... Till I met You,. There were these things that made my day,. But You changed my views,. And I realized that there is more to life,. Than a Chevrolet.. And You say there's something different now,. About the way I hold my head, and I am,. Ready for it now,. To line 'em up and knock them down... (chorus). Come along now. Grab a hand Iâ€™ll show you how. We can all get out of here. Well soon it'll all be gettin' clear.. Take me, break me, you never gonna shake me,. There's a lot about me you don't know so don't doubt me.... I was sent to let the world know,. Wind me up and let me go,. Told ya I would never be truly artificial,. Won't just back down sittin' in the background. Never play your enemy you'll never see the end of me. It's ok, if you need some time,. need some time to think,. and it's alright,. I won't walk the line,. until I see you blink (x2). (chorus)."

You'll never take me down. Explosion dig it like rust croatian. When it goes it gushes like a busted nose. Competitors I was born to set it off. They wrapped me cloth I grabbed a mic and went on tour. Smash it back in school I was hazard. Because I never saw the glass man I just looked past it. Had a passion to burn like battery acid. Peter parker bit by some radioactive. People used to tell me that I'm on my own. They said I'd never make difference on this microphone. Because there's a million other people who can sing this song.

fly on the wall,"The other night. I had a dream. There was a world full of kings and queens. But it was cold. Dark as the night. We were the fire under moonlit skies. We weren't divided.

I let into my head. I know. I hold the keys. So don't be scared when I turn and shout:. I don't think I need you anymore. Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!. I don't think I need you anymore. Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!. I wanna live, I wanna be the change. We can all be kings and queens. If we can just learn to believe. If we can just learn to believe. We had a plan. To build a wall. A great divide that would never fall. To separate us. From all the pain. And keep the skeletons locked away. And brick by brick. We built it so thick. That it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight. And one by one. We all became numb. We were making the bullets to a broken gun. If I could just see it all. Just like the fly on the wall. Would I be able to accept what I can't control?. And would I share what I saw?. Or just sit back and ignore. Like nothing never happened. And I haven't seen you before?. I'm on the run from a thief. I let into my head. I know. I hold the keys. So don't be scared when I turn and shout:. I don't think I need you anymore.

push,"This world can't hold us. You can't mess with soldiers. There's no cell big enough to hold us. We came to be a wrecking ball to these boulders. Know this, I ain't scared of these cobras. Over time, they've tried to just fold us. They thought they could mess with this focus. But there's no room for these locusts. 'Cause real faith's belief without borders. Hold this. We yell, but no one hears. We persevere, as we approach the line. We march, for all those fears, that kept us here. This time they're left behind. Acting like they don't notice. But they're just mad because they can't mold us. Told you never underestimate soldiers. 'Cause you can build a thousand walls. You can't hold us. If we just keep running away. We'll never make it alive. Until we stand and we fight. Aim, fire, and blow it away. We're storming enemy lines. Leaving no one behind. This rock can't hold us. 'Cause the light has shown us. No fear's big enough to own us. We were never meant to fit in these folders. Know this, I ain't scared of these posers. Over time we all face opponents. They thought they could mess with this focus. They forgot, the end of the climb's the coldest, known as. Life's a battlefield of moments, hold this"
quicken,"I've got things that make me feel unordinary. Not necessarily in need of therapy. But I know things have been slipping. Loosening my grip. How much closer until. I'm bound to hit the ground. Sound the alarm. But remain calm. My time is drawn. Never meant to cause anyone no harm. This time things will be different. I promise, I really promise. And this time things will be different. It grows and grows and grows. CHORUS. Cause it's the way we talk, the way we walk. The way your words connect my thoughts. The way we move, the way we stand. The way our world is in your hands. My life's just like a prison. We shout but no one listens. We're set all in position. Use us, take us, break us. Questions running through my mind. I'm falling behind. I never would have guessed. This could happen to me. This frustration is all I see. And you're taking me. And you're breaking me down. And this will be different. I promise, I really promise. And this time things will be different. It grows and grows and grows. CHORUS. It's coming to that point. I'm down on my knees. And I'm praying. You can change my life. And change me. I'll follow you there. I've nothing to lose. Unwind me, heal my sickness. Unravel this, and set me free. CHORUS."

We got that classic touch. Not in chains. Still representing that same boy. You betcha. The intellectual. It's all about smooth texture. We can be like hooligans and get it on quick. Slickw when the riff hits your. Eardrum and the word sticks. Like think quick. When in doubt who you goin to?. Who you owing to?. On the other end. Who's gonna be your friend?. Just a little something to think about no doubt. Thousand 'bout to let the rhime animal out. We be rocking on till dawn and back again. When you here to jam to the volume back up to ten. I love music. Can't imagine being here without it. Turn it up so your neighbors all hear about it. Thousand Foot with the sound to move ya. We got the rhythm that'll run right through ya. Throw your hands up if the music soothes yah. We rock on like a power booster. Thousand Foot with the sound to move ya. We got the rhythm that'll run right through ya. Never wasting moves never standing still come on. And make way for the rhime animal. Well it's the second verse and. No need for rehearsing. I be the rhime animal. Live and in person. Wanna give a shout to all the real hip hoppers. Who come to all of our shows and represent proper. Turning to those who understand what Thousand Foot do. Cause it ain't entirely easy. In this industry. To pick up a mic and start rapping. And put on guitar straps and start singing. We'll be like ""What happened?!"". And yo we just can't get the hang of it. When really it's you can't understand the slang of it. So what if a rock band were to throw a few. Ask a few rascals jumping around. And some finger snaps said uh. If you still don't get it man forget about it. By the time you accept it. We'll be makin a new record. It's all good though. It don't really matter. The Krutch don't care. We down for whatever. Yo everybody swing. Listen to the guitar sing. Check it."

Intention to see a picture of me and trap myself. All this time, we've been mislead,. ...Does anyone care at all?. Sometimes i fall asleep and then i lose control. I try to find my way out without letting go. And will i lose my mind if it comes back this time?. If i dont turn out perfect will you be a friend of mine?. It's coming around again and i've found sometimes i sit. When i should get up and just walk away. Sometimes i pretend and act like i do. But don't listen to a word you say. And sometimes when i start talking out loud. Should just shut my mouth and walk away. Sometimes i feel like maybe it's real and think like nobody else. Too close to myself and suffocate. Are you ready to crawl out?. Are you ready to take my hand and see?. Are you ready to crawl out?. From within the slow bleed?. From within the slow bleed?. From within the slow bleed?.

But they can't step over me. You try to control me. But ya can't hold me. You don't own me. If you ever step to me. CHORUS. I know it's not me. Take a look inside me. I'm sick of these ways. So sick of these games. Couldn't see it til I multiplied you. Call me a freak. But I don't hear the words you speak. I'm takin' control. Just lettin' you know. That I won't get sucked in by you. CHORUS. BRIDGE. Again, you try to control me. But ya can't hold me. You don't own me. If you ever step to me."
stranger,"Stranger. It's just the state of affection. Just need something to cure the infection. I don't want to be your misconception. No, no, don't want to break the connection. It's just the pent up aggression. That drives me into this direction. If I had to ask just one question. ""Oh no, how come they don't listen?"". It don't want to slip, I don't want to fall,. I don't want to care, or be here at all,. I don't want to crash, I don't want to burn,. I won't want to forget what I'v learned. I'm a stranger that no one can see. A stranger to every part of me. I'm a stranger to all that I know. A stranger, everywehre I go. Sometimes I don't hate but I want to. Blinded by the reason I found you. It's just a feeling I get when I'm around you. Can you relate to what I'm going through?. How much farther will I get?. Man, I feel like such a moving targer. how many times will I slip before I find it?. Until then I guess I'll just keep climbing. It's so hard when you're a loser. Heaven help us find out way. And it's so hard cuause I'm a loser. Heaven help me feel o.k."

Where the strong run for cover and the weak stand tall. . Pre-Chorus:. I'm not one to stand the masses. But there's somethings that melt the plastic. Try and dig down deeper if you can. Chorus:. I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed. I'm not to blame. Welcome to the masquerade. I'm not ashamed. I'm not afraid. I'm not okay. Welcome to the masquerade. [Welcome to the masquerade]. We've got the power, who's got the action. Break it down til there's nothing but a mere fraction. Out of the fire, rise from the ashes. Recheck yourself and release the passion. Let's get on it, believe if you want it. step into the realm where the real ones flaunt it. Come back, rewind, another time on it. Reach out, take that, but now step on it"
what do we know,"Pick up the phone, nobody's home, im all alone. We've all been here before. yesterday I saw a change, another way. As you walked out the door. Its a twist, a little bit, I'll admit. But we're stronger than before. Open up, we've had enough. We've had enough, now we're holdin on. And waiting. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. I'll tell you what they're all sayin'. [x2]. We all try to be somebody. But the world around us makes it so cloudy. When we don't trust where we're supposed to. But the blood on their hands. Says we're not close to the answer yet. But maybe if we pull together, we could change. A million lives for the better. And maybe if we prayed a little more. We will stop living in fear from the storm. And everyone sings. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. I'll tell you what they're all sayin'. [x2]. Every part is you, every part if me. Raise your hands and sing. Tell them we can be. Show them who you are, show them you can see. Raise your hands and sing. Tell them we are free. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. I'll tell you what they're all sayin'. [x3]. Every part is you, every part if me. Raise your hands and sing. Tell them we can be. Show them who you are, show them you can see. Raise your hands and sing. Tell them we are free. (What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. What do we know?. I'll tell you what they're all sayin')"
when in doubt,"Sat upon your bed,. You've said the things you've said. And I cannot believe that you seem so naive. We exchanged our poetry,. You seem to think a lot like me. I'll guess I'll just assume that we could talk about most anything. Then I ask have you ever felt abandoned?. Felt so lost that you were stranded,. Just like all the walls are closing in. And you were left inside. Have you ever felt like your days were numbered?. Stuck under a tree in thunder. Seems to be no way out!. But there is One when in doubt!!!. Ready for another day!. Slowly watch yah waste away,. Havin' fun, bein' cool. Like we did in high school,. Elementary romance feelin' nervous at the dance,. Crack a smile hold it down,. Whatever the circumstance,. Sex, Drugs, gotta be cool,. All the things we learned in school,. Typical teenage machines,. Anyone tell me what this means?. I could learn, I could try,. Never really had an alibi. Wish I did, thatâ€™s no lie. (chorus). And you ask why (first time- every bodys askin why). When you feel like you could fly. Gotta know I got the answer for yah baby,. Drives yah crazy it's not over. So much more to life then this, why?. When you feel like you could fly. Gotta know I got the answer for yah baby,. Drives yah crazy it's not over. So much more to life then this. Things seem so hallucinary,. In the corners of my mind they scare me,. I know yah never meant to desert me,. Just like yah never really meant to hurt me. Then I ask have you ever felt abandoned?. Felt so lost that you were stranded,. Just like all the walls are closing in. And you were left inside. Have you ever felt like your days were numbered?. Stuck under a tree in thunder. Seems to be no way out!. But there is One when in doubt!!!. (chorus). So much more to life than this!!!."
wish you well,Sometimes love feels like pain. And sometimes I wonder if its all the same. Sometimes light feels just like rain. Cause you never know when its gonna fall down on you. I wish you well. I wish you well. On this trip to find yourself. I wish you well. Wish I could help. But I can't help you find yourself. Sometimes faith feels like doubt. And sometimes I wonder if we'll ever get out. Sometimes life hurts just like now. But you gotta now its all gonna come back around. I wish you well. I wish you well. On this trip to find yourself. I wish you well. Wish I could help. But I can't help you find yourself. Find yourself. I can't help you find yourself. Find yourself. And we were 16 at the time. Nothing could ever change our minds. We were one step below invincible. And we always fought it. You've never been the same. You were so scared to make a name. Then you threw it all away. And I wish you'd come back now. I wish you well. I wish you well. On this trip to find yourself. I wish you well. Wish I could help. But I can't help you find yourself. I wish you well. I wish you well. On this trip to find yourself. I wish you well. Wish I could help. But I can't help you find you. I wish you well. I wish you well. On this trip to find yourself. I wish you well. Wish I could help. But I can't help you find yourself. Find yourself. I can't help you find yourself. Find yourself. I can't help you find yourself
