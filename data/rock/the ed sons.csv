Like we've never had before. I'll keep on dancing with you. To be myself once more. Was it easy money?. Was it easy sex?. Was it easy fame?. This is a game I learned how to play. I wish you could come and find me. While I find out what life is all about. I wish you could come and find me. Time will not help you track me down. Was it easy money?. Was it easy sex?. Was it easy fame?. This is a game I learned how to play. Was it easy money?. Was it easy sex?. Was it easy fame?. This is a game I learned how to play
no sugar,"Girl. You make my heart pump mad like it's full of caffeine. No. I can't avoid having another cup in my veins. Some. Might say things just don't work like this. They. Wouldn't believe. Couldn't achieve. Or even dream. Whoah, you've got no sugar baby. But I like it bitter just that way. Whoah, if you come closer baby. I might get burned again. It's too hot when you play games. Face it. You're like a drug to me. True. If I'm letting you go there and see. Tonight. There's no excuse, you're not going to flee. I. Wouldn't believe. Couldn't achieve. Or even dream. Whoah, you've got no sugar baby. But I like it bitter just that way. Whoah, if you come closer baby. I might get burned again. It's too hot when you play games. As I take a sip of my last drink. And take a drag of my cigarette. I just take a look at the void. And awkwardly feel another heartbeat. Whoah, you've got no sugar baby. But I like it bitter just that way. Whoah, if you come closer baby. I might get burned again. It's too hot when you play games"

red lights,"Sell your dreams, make a bet. Fill your mind, then just forget. Follow me and lose your soul. Cuz you already know that you'll never know.. Find the ground. Lock and load. Siren sounds. Hit the road. Red lights on the sight. Clouds and stripes draw this night. Now it leaves you alone. And you see it must be, keep unknown. Time to think. Settle down. Go to a shrink. Broke and bound. Where are my wings? I say. Look for your brain! You say. I'm going to bed now. Just to erase this fucking day"
shame,"Round and round spinning. Hangover's winning. Can't stand living. I think I've had enough.. What were you thinkin'?. Can't stop spinning. Gotta keep on working. I'm sure I've had enough. Again and again. What a fucking shame. Remember back then. All that innocence. Like if you were ill. Have to get some pills. I'll tell you how I feel. I think I've had enough. Hold your head still. Get me a night to kill. Lots of forms to fill. I'm sure I've had enough. Again and again. What a fucking shame. Remember back then. All that innocence. When you hit the ground is always the same. Traded some love for a one night stand. But then the worst is over, can you feel the pain?. Starts all over again!"
the last cigarette,"Oh, you're gonna feel electric. Your hands will be shaking. No sweet dreams tonight. Cause you need the last cigarette.. The pills are not working. No therapy can help now. You can listen to lullabies all night. But you still need the last cigarette. Ahh, take it off of me. I just wanna fall sleep. So I wait, and I wait, and I wait. Until mama is no longer awake. Boy, you're so young. This addiction will follow you. With the skin full of nicotine. But you still need the last cigarette"
who knows,"I climb these stairs by your side. My thrill is gone and I wanted more. Lots of eyes below the dimmed lights. I just don't know what I was waiting for.. You know that look you know I wanna try. I can see exactly what's behind the door. Is it just between you and I. What if I come back later and ask for more?. Who knows you'll find something. Who knows you'll mind it someday. Who knows you'll hide it someway. Who knows if you'll ever know. You climb these stairs by my side. I think I've seen you 'round here before. Let's go I'll take you for a ride. This is so cool that you'll be back I'm sure. The same dazed eyes below the bright lights. The same mess all lying on the floor. This is just between you and I. Just come back later and ask for more. Who knows you'll find something. Who knows you'll mind it someday. Who knows you'll hide it someway. Who knows if you'll ever know, yeah.
