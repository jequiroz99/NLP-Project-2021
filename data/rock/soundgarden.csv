switch opens,"lyrics by Chris Cornell. music by Ben Shepherd. Hey you slave, go hang your owners. Draw your names among their ashes. Put your children on their thrones. Gather â€˜round and fall right down. Here at sundown nothing is when. Everything is all right. Switch opens. Opening around and letâ€™s the garden rise. Switch is on. Hey, you patients. Whereâ€™s your surgeon. Left with your. Insides open. Hung your hearts out. On the table. Gather â€˜round and fall right down. Feel the air now. Stumbling and wander in the moonshine. Switch opens. Nothing is when everything is all right. Switch is on."

Somewhere in the dreams. Of those who should. Live in all the keeps. Echo all the worlds. In laughs of love. . For times that pass my life. I'll search for the sky. That she wonders by. . Somewhere in the dreams. That the skies hold. Still the willow weeps. On roses for her bed. In laughs of love"

Out from and far away. The wooden stake. This thing has got me on. Diamond rope silver chain. Pretty noose is pretty pain. And I don't like what you got me hanging from. Common ruse dirty face. Pretty noose is pretty hate. And I don't care what you got. I don't care what you need. I don't want anything. And I don't like what you got me hanging from.

Turning metal into gold. A secret till the last wordâ€™s untold. . Accused and convicted. For nothing I suffer your fear. Nailed to a burning cross. Heretic, Heretic."

just like suicide,Heard it from another room. Eyes were waking up just to fall asleep. Love's like suicide. Dazed out in a garden bed. With a broken neck lays my broken gift. Just like suicide. And my last ditch. Was my last brick. Lent to finish her. Finish her. She lived like a murder. How she'd fly so sweetly. She lived like a murder. But she died. Just like suicide. Bit down on the bullet now. I had a taste so sour. I had to think of something sweet. Love's like suicide. Safe outside my gilded cage. With an ounce of pain. I wield a ton of rage. Just like suicide. . With eyes of blood. And bitter blue. How I feel for you. I feel for you. She lived like a murder. How she'd fly so sweetly. She lived like a murder. But she died. Just like suicide. . by Pstoddi

Seal my tomb without my face. I'm going to the lonely place. Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me. Give up to fate, you don't have to need me. So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it. Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you. Music: Cornell; Lyrics: Cornell."

Little Joe, just like your father. Your eyes will water, your guts will splatter. Though sticks and fire, sticks and fire. Wonâ€™t break your bones, it is a lie. . Little Joe, run for the border. Leave your mother and father. Go to where the reptiles roam. Theyâ€™re waiting for you, Little Joe."

And the police said this was normal control. And the cradle was burning yesterday. Like somebody's best friend died. And I've been caught in a mind riot. I was crying from my eye teeth and. Bleeding from my soul. And I sharpened my wits on a dead man's skull. I built an elevator from his bones. Had climb to the top floor just. To stamp out the coals. And the cradle was burning yesterday. Like somebody's friend died. And I've been caught in a mind riot. I'm tied within. I'm luck's last match struck. In the pouring down wind

I play, I'm sick and tame. Drawing the hordes. I wait, and show the lame. The meaning of harm. The skulls beneath my feet. Like feathers in sand. I graze among the graves. A feeling of peace. Only bending when you break. Only feeding when you're cold. Only healing when you ache. Only feeling when you don't"

But you can't grow feathers in the rain. And the naked floor is cold as hell. This naked floor reminds me. Oh the naked floor reminds me. And I'm lost, behind. Words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As the seasons roll on by. If I should be short on words. And long on things to say. Could you crawl into my world. And take me worlds away. Should I be beside myself. And never even stay. And I'm lost behind. Words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As the seasons roll on by"

tighter and tighter,written by Chris Cornell. Shadow face. Blowing smoke and talking wind. Lost my grip. Fell too far to start again. A sudden snake. Found my shape and tells the world. Remember this. Remember everything is just black. Or burning sun. And I hope itâ€™s a sweet ride. Sleep tight for me. Sleep tight for me Iâ€™m gone. Warm and sweet. Swinging from a windows ledge. Tight and deep. One last sin before Iâ€™m dead. A sucking holy wind. Will take me from this bed tonight. And bloody wits. Another hits me and I have to say goodbye. And I hope itâ€™s a sweet ride. Here for me tonight. â€˜Cause I feel Iâ€™m going. Feel Iâ€™m slowing down

zero chance,I think I know the answer. I stumbled on and all the world fell down. And all the sky went silent. Cracked like glass and slowly. Tumbled to the ground. They all say if you look hard. You'll find your way back home. Born without a friend. And bound to die alone. I'm thinking of your highness. And crying long upon the loss. I've found. And on the plus and minus. Zero chance of ever. Turning this around. Why doesn't anyone believe. In loneliness?. Stand up and everyone will see. Your holiness. They say if you look hard. You'll find your way back home. Born without a friend. And bound to die alone
