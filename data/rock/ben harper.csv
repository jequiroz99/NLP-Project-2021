blessed to be a witness,Corcovado parted the sky. And through the darkness. On us He shined. Crucified in stone. Still His blood is my own. Glory behold all my eyes have seen.

I am blessed to be a witness. So much sorrow and pain. Still I will not live in vain. Like good questions never asked. Is wisdom wasted on the past. Only by the grace of God go I. I am blessed to be a witness.
blood side out,Got a wine soaked heart. And whisky soaked lips. Don't know how to get to you. But I know how to get my kicks. Out in the cold and damp. Out on the streets just like a tramp.

Took all I can take I ain't broke I might break. Don't go no further. These streets they're littered with faces the same. And all these strangers have no names. Blood side out. I'm going in. I'm down again. Got a wine soaked heart. And whisky soaked lips. The country may be in your bones. But the city's in your hips. There's a siren in the distance. Screaming my name. Blood side out. Will it ever end. I'm down again
born to love you,Was thinking just the other day. Of something I've been trying to say. But I couldn't find the way. To tell you I was born to love you. Some born to lose. Some born to win. They say we're all born into sin. That's a hard way to begin. But I was born to love you. Some come in with a burden. Heavy hearted and hurting. Who's unworthy who's deserving. But I was born to love you. Some made for days some made for nights. Some to stand up for what's right. No matter how hard the fight. I was born to love you. I love you. I live you. I love to live you. I live to love you. I was born to love you

city of dreams,Day breaks over the city of my childhood. Daybreak over the city I called home. Where the sage met the sea. And the groves were sweet and green. It's a city that lives only in my dreams. The groves where we played when we were children. The groves where we fooled around as teens. Those green groves are paved from la to santa fe. That city lives only in my dreams. Landmarks lost to parking lots in the city I called home. Looking back I see what used to be. Now freeways crawl though the suburban sprawl. As far as the eye can see. And the city lives only in my dreams. Twilight shades the valley of my memory. When citrus groves still perfumed the sky. But I guess those orange blossoms. Weren't so special after all. Now it's a city of days gone by. Landmarks lost to parking lots in the city I called home. Looking back I see what used to be. Now freeways crawl through the suburban sprawl. As far as the eye can see. And the city lives only in my dreams

And when I come to her when the sun goes down. She takes away my trouble, takes away my grief. Takes away all of my heartache, in the night like a thief. She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love. She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love. Crazy love. She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love. Yes I need her in the daytime.

She's the kind of woman only a town like this could produce. Just mean enough to hang a man. Just kind enough to cut the noose. Reached into her purse to pull out her disguise.

You whip the back of freedom. ‘till it bleeds an oil stream. Then you sail down upon it. In your killing machine. Gather 'round the stone. Old men who send children. Off to die in vain. They will hear death's constant whisper. Call remember my name. Gather 'round the stone

And she will be at rest with Him above.. And some glad morning, she I know will welcome me.. To that eternal home of peace and love.."

There's something in everyone. Only they know. It moves in the hidden ways. Of joy and sorrow. Never leave lonely alone

But there's nothing can keep me from loving you. Not fire, nor, not ice. Not fire, nor, not ice. Like the hero or the champion. You are the best, you're the best. Like religion or superstition. With you I am blessed. With you I am blessed. Now the river may grow wider. The mountains may reach past the sky. But wether or not you feel the same. My love shall never die.

two hands of a prayer,"First time that I saw her she had white doves in her eyes. She spoke to me but I could not reply, not reply. She was a stranger I had known for years. She brought to me so many smiles and tears, smiles and tears. The two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer. (""Time""). Time it slowly drips into the past, into the past. And finds a home where all echoes rest, where echoes rest (""With a cold rest""). She softly kissed my mind, my mind, and whispered what will we do with time, do. with time. The two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer. Am I the man I choose to be, choose to be,. Or just the man I used to be, used to be. Am I the man I want to be, I want to be. this question, it keeps haunting me, haunting me. The two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer. Together like the two hands of a prayer."

There's no sound louder than war. And we don't have tomorrow anymore. You wrote a list with all your demands. And you nailed it to both of my hands. It's up to you now. It's up to you now. My fist is full of ashes. And my blood is in the ground. So it's up to you now"

Like a cry for help that nobody hears. Close as you can get. But I'm still nowhere near. I'm just here waiting on your sign. I'm running out of time. So you blow a veil of smoke.

walk away,Oh no. Here comes that sun again. That means another day. Without you my friend. And it hurts me. To look into the mirror at myself. And it hurts even more. To have to be with somebody else. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away. With so many people. To love in my life. Why do I worry. About one. But you put the happy. In my ness. You put the good times. Into my fun. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away.

But I would rather be locked to you. Than live in this pain and misery. They say time will. Make all this go away. But it's time that has taken my tomorrows. And turned them into yesterdays. And once again that rising sun. Is dropping on down. And once again you my friend. Are nowhere to be found. And it's so hard to do. And so easy to say. But sometimes. Sometimes you just have to walk away. Walk away. And head for the door. You just walk away. Walk away

Every look of shame. Is a wound that will never heal. What has he done to deserve this. What have I done to deserve this. It's easy to remember. But it's easier to forget. Life has a way of getting in our way. I don't want to go my way. If you're not going my way. So I guess that means. I'll be going your way. I will lead or follow. Beg steal or borrow. Just for one more day. We can't end this way

wicked man,"Children come running to the truth. But you got to peel the skin to get the food. And while one is living high, another is grieving. But what sweet by morning is bitter by the evening. I say the wicked man shall fall. Wheen the moon chase away the sun. And force my day to run. I shall not fear the darkest night. For I know upon the other side is light. I say the wicked man shall fall. Every man is a common man. And every common has his plan. But while the hungry man seek any food, any food in sight. There's a greedy man who seek only appetite. I say the wicked man shall fall."
