unbelievers,"Got a little soul. The world is a cold, cold place to be. Want a little warmth. But who's going to save a little warmth for me?. We know the fire awaits, unbelievers.

But who is gonna save a little grace for me?. We know the fire awaits, unbelievers. All of the sinners the same. Girl, you and I will die unbelievers. Bound to the tracks of the train.

Wonder if the water contains a little drop, little drop for me. See the sun go down. It's going on down when the night is deep. Want a little light. But who's going to save a little light for me?.

harmony hall,"We took a vow in summertime. Now we find ourselves in late December. I believe that New Year's Eve. Will be the perfect time. For their great surrender. But they don't remember. Anger wants a voice. Voices wanna sing. Singers harmonize. Til they can't hear anything. I thought that I was free. From all that questioning. But every time a problem ends. Another one begins. And the stone walls of Harmony Hall. Bear witness. Anybody with a worried mind. Could never forgive the sight. Of wicked snakes. Inside a place. You thought was dignified. I don't wanna live like this. But I don't wanna die. I don't wanna live like this. But I don't wanna die. Within the halls of power lies. A nervous heart that beats. Like a Young Pretender's. Beneath these velvet gloves I hide. The shameful, crooked hands. Of a moneylender. Cuz I still remember. Anger wants a voice. Voices wanna sing. Singers harmonize. Til they can't hear anything. I thought that I was free. From all that questioning. But every time a problem ends. Another one begins. And the stone walls of Harmony Hall. Bear witness. Anybody with a worried mind.

a-punk,"Johanna drove slowly into the city. The Hudson River all filled with snow. She spied the ring on His Honor's finger. Oh-oh-oh. A thousand years in one piece of silver. She took it from his lilywhite hand. Showed no fear - she'd seen the thing. In the Young Men's Wing at Sloan-Kettering. Chorus:. Look outside at the raincoats coming, say Oh. His Honor drove southward seeking exotica. Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico. Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas. Oh-oh-oh. I saw Johanna down in the subway. She took an apartment in Washington Heights. Half of the ring lies here with me. But the other half's at the bottom of the sea. Chorus"
step,"Every time I see you in the world. You always step to my girl. Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat. Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam. While home in New York was champagne and disco. Tapes from L. A. slash San Francisco. But actually Oakland and not Alameda. Your girl was in Berkley with her communist reader. Mine was entombed with a boombox and walkman. I was a hoarder, but girl that was back then. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out. What you on about?. I feel it in my bones. I feel it in my bones. I'm stronger now. I'm ready for the house. Such a modest mouse. I can't do it alone. I can't do it alone. Every time I see you in the world. You always step to my girl. Ancestors told me that their girl was better. She's richer than croesus. She's tougher than leather. I just ignored all the tales of a past life. Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife. And punks who would laugh when they saw us together. Well they didn't know how to dress for the weather. I can still see them there huddled on Astor. Snow falling slow to the sound of the master. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out. What you on about?. I feel it in my bones. I feel it in my bones. I'm stronger now. I'm ready for the house. Such a modest mouse. I can't do it alone. I can't do it alone. Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth. Age is an honor, it's still not the truth. We saw the stars when they hid from the world. You cursed the sun when it stepped to you girl. Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her. The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her. We know the true death, the true way of all flesh. Everyone's dying, but girl you're not old yet. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out. What you on about?. I feel it in my bones. I feel it in my bones. I'm stronger now. I'm ready for the house. Such a modest mouse. I can't do it alone. I can't do it alone. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out. What you on about?. I feel it in my bones. I feel it in my bones.

A man of faith said. Hidden eyes could see what I was thinking. I just smiled and told him. That was only true of Hannah. And we glided on through Waverley and Lincoln. Our days were long our nights no longer. Count the seconds, watching hours. Though we live on the US dollar. You and me, we got our own sense of time. In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried. And missed those freezing beaches. And I walked into town. To buy some kindling for the fire. Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces. If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah. There's no future, there's no answer. Though we live on the US dollar. You and me, we got our own sense of time"

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten. Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on. (Whoaaaaaa ooooh). You'd remember drinking horchata. You'd still enjoy it with your foot on masada. Winter's cold is too much to handle. Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals. Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten. Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on. Ooh you had it but oh no you lost it. Lookin back you shouldn't have fought it. In December, drinking horchata. I'd look psychotic in a balaclava. Winter's cold is too much to handle. Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals. Years go by and hearts start to harden. Those palms and firs that grew in your garden. Falling down and nearing the rose beds. The roots are shooting up through the tool shed. Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went. Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement. Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten. Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on. Oh you had it but oh no you lost it. You understood so you shouldn't have fought it. Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten.

giving up the gun,"Your sword's grown old and rusty. Burnt beneath the rising sun. It's locked up like a trophy. Forgetting all the things it's done. And though it's been a long time. You're right back where you started from. I see it in your eyes. That now you're giving up the gun. When I was 17, I had wrists like steel. And I felt complete.

Your Tokugawa smile and your garbage style. Used to save the night. You felt the coming wave, told me we'd all be brave. You said you wouldn't flinch. But in the years that passed since I saw you last. You haven't moved an inch. Your sword's grown old and rusty. Burnt beneath the rising sun. It's locked up like a trophy.

A man of faith said. Hidden eyes could see what I was thinking. I just smiled and told him. That was only true of Hannah. And we glided on through Waverley and Lincoln. Our days were long our nights no longer. Count the seconds, watching hours. Though we live on the US dollar. You and me, we got our own sense of time. In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried. And missed those freezing beaches. And I walked into town. To buy some kindling for the fire. Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces. If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah. There's no future, there's no answer. Though we live on the US dollar. You and me, we got our own sense of time"

The time has a come. The clock is such a drag. All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag. Hudson died on Hudson Bay. But I was born on Sutton Place. The rising tide helped me decide to change my name again. Some men tend to linger on. and some make haste from Babylon. Some will roam their ruined home, rejoicing 'till the end. [Chorus]. Over and over again, all these never-ending visions. Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands. The time has a come. The clock is such a drag.

Why would you lie about anything at all?. First the window, then it's through the wall. Why would you tape my conversations?. Show your paintings. At the United Nations. Lil' Jon, he always tells the truth"
run,"Every dollar counts. And every morning hurts. We mostly work to live. Until we live to work. She said,. ""You know. There's nowhere else to go"". But changing roles. It struck me that the two of us could run. Worlds away from cars. And all the stars and bars. Where a little bit of condensation means so much. And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch. I said,. ""You know. There's nowhere else to go"". But changing roles. It struck me that the two of us could run. Honey, with you. Is the only way to go. And I could take two. But I really couldn't ever know. Honey, with you. And a battered radio. We could try. So lead my feet away. Cuz all they'll do is stay. And I don't think your eyes. Have ever looked surprised. She said,. ""You know. There's nowhere else to go"". But with her fund. It struck me that the two of us could run. Honey, with you. Is the only honest way to go. And I could take two. But I really couldn't ever know. Honey, with you. And a battin radio. We could try"
step,"Every time I see you in the world. You always step to my girl. Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat. Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam. While home in New York was champagne and disco. Tapes from L. A. slash San Francisco. But actually Oakland and not Alameda. Your girl was in Berkley with her communist reader. Mine was entombed with a boombox and walkman. I was a hoarder, but girl that was back then. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out. What you on about?. I feel it in my bones. I feel it in my bones. I'm stronger now. I'm ready for the house. Such a modest mouse. I can't do it alone. I can't do it alone. Every time I see you in the world. You always step to my girl. Ancestors told me that their girl was better. She's richer than croesus. She's tougher than leather. I just ignored all the tales of a past life. Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife. And punks who would laugh when they saw us together. Well they didn't know how to dress for the weather. I can still see them there huddled on Astor. Snow falling slow to the sound of the master. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out. What you on about?. I feel it in my bones. I feel it in my bones. I'm stronger now. I'm ready for the house. Such a modest mouse. I can't do it alone. I can't do it alone. Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth. Age is an honor, it's still not the truth. We saw the stars when they hid from the world. You cursed the sun when it stepped to you girl. Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her. The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her. We know the true death, the true way of all flesh. Everyone's dying, but girl you're not old yet. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out. What you on about?. I feel it in my bones. I feel it in my bones. I'm stronger now. I'm ready for the house. Such a modest mouse. I can't do it alone. I can't do it alone. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out. What you on about?. I feel it in my bones. I feel it in my bones. I'm stronger now. I'm ready for the house. Such a modest mouse. I can't do it alone. I can't do it alone. Every time I see you in the world. You always step to my girl"
taxi cab,Unsentimental. Driving around. Sure of myself. Sure of it now. You stand this close to me. Like the future was supposed to be. In the aisles of the Grocery. In the blocks uptown. I remember. Remember it well. But if I forgotten. Could you tell. In the shadow of your first attack. I was questioning and looking back. You said baby we don't speak of that. Like a real aristocrat. Compound to compound. Lazy and safe. Wanting to leave it. Born in two ways. When the taxi door was open wide. I pretended I was horrified. By the uniform clothes outsid. Of the courtyard gate. You're not a victim. But neither am I. Nostalgic for garbage. Desperate for time. I could blame it on your mother's head. Or the colors that you father wears. But I know that I was never fair. You were always fine. Unsentimental. Driving around. Sure of myself. Sure of it now. You stand this close to me. Like the future was supposed to be. In the aisles of the Grocery. In the blocks uptown. I remember. Remember it well. But if I forgotten. Could you tell. In the shadow of your first attack. I was questioning and looking back. You were standing on another track. Like a real aristocrat
the kids don't stand a chance,"A devastating backstroke. All the way from France. With shiny, shiny cufflinks. A shirtsleeve to enhance. The pin-striped men of morning. Are coming for to dance. With pure Egyptian Cotton. The kids don't stand a chance. You criticize the practice. By murdering their plants. Ignoring all the history. Denying them romance. The pin-striped men of morning. Are coming for to dance. Forty-million dollars. The kids don't stand a chance. I didn't like the business. But that was at first glance. Your pillow feels so soft now. But still you must advance. The pin-striped men of morning. The partners in the dance. The paper's shot to pieces. The kids don't stand a chance"
unbelievers,"Got a little soul. The world is a cold, cold place to be. Want a little warmth. But who's going to save a little warmth for me?. We know the fire awaits, unbelievers. All of the sinners the same. Girl, you and I will die unbelievers. Bound to the tracks of the train. If I'm born again. I know that the world will desagree. Wanna a little grace. But who is gonna save a little grace for me?. We know the fire awaits, unbelievers. All of the sinners the same. Girl, you and I will die unbelievers. Bound to the tracks of the train. I'm not excited. But should I be?. Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?. I know I love you. And you love the sea. Wonder if the water contains a little drop, little drop for me. See the sun go down. It's going on down when the night is deep. Want a little light. But who's going to save a little light for me?. We know the fire awaits, unbelievers. All of the sinners the same. Girl, you and I will die unbelievers. Bound to the tracks of the train. I'm not excited. But should I be?. Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?. I know I love you. And you love the sea. Wonder if the water contains a little drop, little drop for me. I'm not excited.

white sky,Then it’s your business. A modern piece of glasswork. Down on the corner that. You walk each day in passing. The elderly sales clerk. With eyes full of suspicion. The whole corporation’s giving it permission. The little stairway. A little bit of carpet. A pair of mirrors that. Are facing one another. Out in both directions. A thousand little Julias. That come together. In the middle of Manhattan. You waited since lunch. It all comes at once. Around the corner. The house that modern art built. I ask for modern art. To keep it out the closet. The people who might own it. The sins of pride and envy. And on the second floor. The Richard Cera Skate Park. Waited since lunch. It all comes at once. Along the park walk. Ask all of our questions. While all the horses. Race taxis in the winter. Look up at the buildings. Imagine who might live there. Imagining you’re walking. On a bowl upon the sing there. You waited since lunch. It all comes at once
worship you,"Only in the way you want it. Only on the day you want it. Only with your understanding. And every single day you want it. Only in the way you want it. Only on the day you want it. Only with your understanding. And every single day you want it. You, you. City with the weight upon it. City in the way you want it. City with the safety of a never-ending place on it. City with the weight upon it. City in the way you want it. City with the safety of a never-ending place on it. You, you. We worshipped you. Your red right hand. Won't we see once again. In foreign soil, in foreign land. Who will guide us through the end?. Call it when you see it. Call it when you see it. Call it on your misery. Call it on your misery. Everlasting praise you wanted. Everlasting praise you wanted. Little bit of light to get us through the final days"
ya hey,"Oh, sweet thing. Zion doesn't love you. And Babylon don't love you. But you love everything. Oh, you saint. America don't love you. So I could never love you. In spite of everything. In the dark of this place. There's the glow of your face. There's the dust on the screen. Of this broken machine. And I can't help but feel. That I've made some mistake. But I let it go. Through the fire and through the flames. You won't even say your name. Through the fire and through the flames. You won't even say your name. Only I am that I am. But who could ever live that way?. Oh the motherland don't love you. The fatherland don't love you. So why love anything?. Oh, good God. The faithless they don't love you. The zealous hearts don't love you. And that's not gonna change. All the cameras and files. All the paranoid styles. All the tension and fear. Of your secret career. And I can't help but feel. That you see the mistakes. But you let it go. Ya Hey. Ya Hey. Ya Hey. Through the fire and through the flames. You won't even say your name. Through the heart and through the flames. You won't even say your name. You say I am that I am. But who could ever live that way?. Outside the tents, on the festival grounds. As the air began to cool, and the sun went down. My soul swooned, as I faintly heard the sound. Of you spinning Israelites. Into ""19th Nervous Breakdown"". Through the fire and through the flames. You won't even say your name. Through the fire and through the flames. You won't even say your name. Only I am that I am. But who could ever live that way?. Through the fire and through the flames. You won't even say your name. Only I am that I am. But who could ever live that way?"
