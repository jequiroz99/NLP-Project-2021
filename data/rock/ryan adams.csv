chains of love,Walk away slowly. You don't have to take this. In the spaces in between. Sadness on the faces. I could see the chains of love. The chains. Talking 'bout the chains of love. Can't take us away. Storms are brewing in your heart. I don't want to waste it. Better to have tried it all. Least we got to taste it. Locked up in the chains of love. We change. Caught up in the chains of love. Can't take us away. Clouds moving over the house. I think about those days. Wish I had something to relax my mind. Send me off to heaven I've got nothing but time. Lightning in the sky above. Blink and see the traces. Everything you are to me. Is bigger than the spaces. Between us and the chains of love. The chains. Locked up in the chains of love. They can't take us away. Can't take us away. Can't take us away. Can't take us away

29,"﻿I was a poor little kid in the lungs of new York. Just like a motherless son of a bitch. Loaded on ephedrine looking for downers and coke. Like a sun that just wouldn't set out on the horizon. Singing and dancing to them nighttime songs. I took a train and came up from Carolina. I was looking for something to do. Nothing I found could ever quite occupy me. With nothing to gain there's always nothing to lose. Singing and dancing to them nighttime songs. Cry me a river till the morning comes. I should've died a hundred thousand times. Teetering stoned off the side of buildings. Nobody loved me and nobody even tried. You can't hang on to something that wont stop moving. Singing and dancing to them nighttime songs. I got arrested down south for hitting a clerk. I spit in his face, the bastard knocked me out. He leered at my lady and then he touched her face. Thank God she had the money to bail me out. Singing and dancing to them nighttime songs. Cry me a river till the morning comes. Bar room boogie just like in the movies. Go on put it to me shake it till the rattles come on. Take me where the morning don't come. I had a dog named Jet, when I was a kid. Until one day he wandered off and died. One night I went in the yard and dug him up. And he laid in the box just like a pile of bones. Singing and dancing to them nighttime songs. I used to get loaded and baby Id drive your car. It seemed like there was always a cop. Coming behind me and following close as they could. Eventually they'd just trail off. Loaded and cruising to them nighttime songs. Cry me a river till the morning comes. Bar room boogie just like in the movies. Go on put it to me shake it till the rattles come on. Take me where the morning don't come. I think I died a hundred thousand times. Mixing liquor with mystery pills. Mystery pills and heroin mixed into cocaine. Face down out on the riverside. Most of my friends are married and making them babies. To most of them I already died. And whatever it is about you I've always hated. Is something about myself I just couldn't hide. And I'm going going baby I'm gone. So cry me a river to the other side of the morning. To where the morning don't come. To where the morning don't come. To where the morning don't come"
a kiss before i go,"The engine turns on a dime. But I ain't goin' nowhere, tonight. I ain't been goin' nowhere for quite awhile. Can't tell the truth in a house of lies. Can't explain what I don't know. One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go. One more kiss 'fore I go. One more night and day. Breath all heavy and slow. One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go. I'll miss those nights at the bar. With every girl all loaded like freights. And the pain in the morning comes as easy as it goes. Can't find the truth in a house of lies. And you can't see tomorrow with yesterday's eyes. One shot, one beer and a place where nobody cries. One more kiss 'fore I go. One more night and day. Breath all heavy and slow. One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go"

"chin up, cheer up","Took a walk with you. In the shadow of my shoes. Danced around the broken blues. In the dirty summer rain. Moonlight on the cars. Parked in single file at bars. With a thick and rosy smoke. Waving its busted hand. Bringing you down, can't bring you down. Bring you down, can't bring you down. Bring you down, can't hear the sound. Run through the river and into town. Pretty little moon with it's head hung down. Chin up. Cheer up.. I took a walk with you. And I busted up my shoe. In an old yellow canoe. Out in Hollywood. You called the police. But they didn't care the lease. On your place had run out. Your landlord straightened his hat. Bringing you down, can't bring you down. Bringing you down, can't bring you down. Bringing you down, can't hear the sound. Run through the river and into town. Pretty little moon with it's head hung down. Chin up. Cheer up.."

clean,"The drought was the very worst. When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst. It was months and months of back-and-forth. You still all over me. Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore. Hung my head as I lost the war. As the sky turned black like a perfect storm. Rain came pouring down. When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe. By morning, gone was any trace of you. I think I am finally clean. There was nothing left to do. When the butterflies turned to dust. They covered my whole room. So I punched a hole in the roof. Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you. The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud. But no one heard a thing. Rain came pouring down. When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe. By morning, gone was any trace of you. I think I am finally clean. See, I think I am finally clean.

learn to love,"I will learn to love, I will learn. And I will teach myself to speak to you out on the city buses. Without talking now that I have some place to turn. I will learn to love, I will learn. I will speak your name, I will speak. And I will say it to myself as I'm quietly night skating. Out on that ice in those rinks they got downtown. That they only use at Christmas time when that Times Square ball comes down. And for that second a lover's kiss bought in that change. Too many birds go scattering to count the wings. But I will learn. I will do these things inside your love. However fragile is how broken it becomes. If I don't tell you how I'm feeling it's because. I'm still learning, but I will learn to love. This is how we walk together, old and filled with holes. In these sweaters, scarves and fireworks between us holding hands. Inside a million stars together as we walk. And we sit on some old bench I touch your hand in this old park. Inside of you, inside us. I will do these things inside your love. However fragile is how broken it becomes. When I don't tell you how I'm feeling it's because. I'm still learning but I will learn to love. And I will never let you go, not now. I'm too old to let you go and I'm too young to let you down. I will hold you close and brush your hair so fine. As the day reclines like old men tired and fed and filled with wine. In their favorite chairs, honey I ain't ever scared. You are with me all the time you are always there. And I will never let you go. I will do these things inside your love. However fragile is how broken it becomes. When I don't tell you how I'm feeling it's because. I'm still learning but I will learn to love. I'm still learning but I will learn to love"
let go,"Pink as a rose the sun is fading. Can you feel the darkness that surrounds the house. Plane as the truth my breath is bated. It pinches like a trap shut around the mouse. But down the road 'cause we fell in. But down the road. Hanging round the wish-it-well. It's a slippery slope. And I let go, let go, let go, let go. Away. Driving at night beside the river. Looking at as it's going nowhere. Dark as a room with the light shut out. I'm feeling round the walls for another way out. But down the road 'cause we fell in. But down the road. Hanging round the wish-it-well. It's a slippery slope. And I let go, let go, let go, let go. Cross your fingers behind your back. And lie. Tell me it's okay if you'll fix everything. 'Cause I let go. Pink as a rose the sunsets fading. Shattering the light on the oceanside. Standing alone, I am not waiting. Maybe I'm asleep, my heart is paralyzed. Down the road 'cause we fell in. But down the road. Hanging round the wish-it-well. It's a slippery slope. And I let go, let go, let go, let go. Away"

Tumbling off a ferry boat. I was at the bar till three. Oh Lord, and I wasn't ready to go. I'm never ready to go. Tennessee's a brother to my sister Carolina where they're gonna bury me.

Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels until it brings me home. Let it ride. Let it roll. Let it go. I wanna see you tonight. Dancing in the endless moonlight. In the parking lot in the headlights of cars. Someplace on the moon. Where they moved the drive-in theater. Where I left the car that I can't find but I still got the keys to. Let it ride. Let it ride easy down the road. Let it ride. Let it take away all of this darkness. Let it ride. Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels until it brings me home. Let it ride. Let it roll.

The rivers they run. They run until they get too tired. Until they run behind the houses. And they become a creek. When I was a child. I ran until the creek became a river. When it turned into the ocean. I wondered why He'd made it so deep. Love her in the ways you want to be loved. Love her in the ways you want to be loved. Love her in the ways you want to be loved. But the way I'm loving her. Must not be enough. Cause the way she cries. It only tears me up. I feel dead inside and dying. Don't give up. Cause in a way she's crying. It only tears me up.

Every day the children they were singing their tune. Out on the streets and you could hear from inside. Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd. I would wait for you and I'd try to hide. And love won't play any games with you. Anymore if you don't want 'em to. The world won't wait and I watched you shake. But honey, I don't blame you. Hell, I still love you, New York. Hell, I still love you, New York. New York. I remember Christmas in the blistering cold. In a church on the upper west side. Babe, I stood their singing, I was holding your arm. You were holding my trust like a child. Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue B. But I tried to keep the overhead low. Farewell to the city and the love of my life. At least we left before we had to go. And love won't play any games with you. Anymore if you don't want 'em to. So we better shake this old thing out the door. I'll always be thinkin' of you. I'll always love you though New York. I'll always love you though New York, New York, New York."

Then they charge you with the rescue blues. Everybody wants to see you suffer. They know that you need the pain so much. They throw you up a rope when you're too high. To cruise, baby. Lord, you lose lady. Then they charge you with the rescue blues. Everybody wants to see you fall. That's why they always love to get you high. And everybody knows you need the pain so much, lady. Well, keep in touch, baby. Just don't charge me with your rescue blues."
the sadness,"The stars they sink. In the oceans of ink. Long black ribbons of cars. And in the taxi. You ask me how I'm doing. But you already know. Beyond, beyond is not through. Its only a reflection of you. And something at the window. It motions with its fingers. Calling me beyond. The sadness is mine. The sadness is mine. Its why you're not healing me. And whatever has come for me. Oh I can give you whatever you're wanting. Just take it and spare me spare me. Please oh tell me this is only a warning/no. Please have mercy let me go. If only a day to let her know. Without her love I'm nothing at all. The change is happening and I'm almost gone. In her heart is my faith. And it wins against the sadness. The train it moves through the desert. The horses they will challenge its stride. And into the boxcar she leaps. And is my hero. And penetrates the demons inside. The clouds they pass. But they're moving so fast. As I watch them collide. Collide and collapse in her arms like a newborn child. I am at one reborn. The fog in the mote. As he grabs me by the throat. It lifts as she comes. She opens her cloak and the color of blood. It is the sign of what now must come. Deny deny me my destiny. I am not ready to go. I am the horror that brings us to the morning. Where I will have to stand up and fight"
the shadowlands,"God, please bring the rain. Yeah, and bring it soon. Let it flood right through the house. Into Judy's room. With a father on amphetamines. Her mother hides the pearls. Reach out into the darkness. And find my little girl. 'Cause she's angry like a salesman. Who just couldn't make a sale. Threw the wedding rings in the sewer. And damned them all to hell. Please lead her to the mountain. That you fashioned out of sand. While the roaches climb the walls. From the hotel where he calls. Most people never find a love. Most people never find a love. Sometimes you just can't be a man. Sometimes you just can't be a man. When you're living in the darkness. Of the shadowlands. The shadowlands. The shadowlands"

I didn't know that people faded out. That people faded out so fast. When there was love enough left to fix it. But there it is. There it is - we are only one push from the nest. There it is - we are only one argument from death. There it is - the sun rises, but the sun also sets. The sun sets, the sun also sets. When you get these feelings. Next time, next time. Oh, be sure.

to be with you,"It's so hard to be without you. Lying in the bed, you are so much to be without. Rattles in my head that empty drum filled with doubt. Everything you lose, the wisdom will find its way out. Every night is lonesome and is longer than before. Nothing really matters anymore. It's so hard to be without you. Used to feel something, and now only I feel humble. Stinging from the storm inside my ribs where it thunders. Nothing left to say or really even wonder. We are like a book and every page is so torn. Nothing really matters anymore. It's so hard not to call you. Thunders in my bones out in the streets where I first saw you. When everything was new and colorful, it's gotten darker. Every day's a lesson, things were brighter before. Nothing really matters anymore. It's so hard to be without you. Everyday I find another little thread of silver. Waiting for me when I wake some place on the pillow. And then I see the empty space beside me and remember. I feel empty, I feel tired, I feel worn. Nothing really matters anymore"

Tonight you're sleeping alone without him. And everything went up in smoke like wild flowers. Wildflowers, dear."
wildest dreams,"He said ""let's get out of this town. Drive out of the city, away from the crowd"". I thought ""heaven can't help me now. Nothing lasts forever. But this is gonna take me down"". He's so tall and handsome as hell. He's so bad but he does it so well. I can see the end as it begins. My one condition is. Say you'll remember me. Standing in a nice dress. Staring at the sunset, babe. Red lips and rosy cheeks. Say you'll see me again. Even if it's just in your wildest dreams. Wildest dreams, oh. I said, ""no one has to know what we do"". His hands are in my hair. His clothes are in my room. And his voice is a familiar sound. Nothing lasts forever. But this is getting good, now. He's so tall and handsome as hell. He's so bad but he does it so well. And when we've had our very last kiss. My last request, it is. Say you'll remember me. Standing in a nice dress. Staring at the sunset, babe. Red lips and rosy cheeks. Say you'll see me again. Even if it's just in your wildest dreams. Wildest dreams, oh. You see me in hindsight. Tangled up with you all night. Burning it down. Some day, when you leave me. I bet these memories. Follow you around. You see me in hindsight. Tangled up with you all night. Burning it down. Some day, when you leave me. I bet these memories. Follow you around. Say you'll remember me. Standing in a nice dress. Staring at the sunset, babe. Red lips and rosy cheeks. Say you'll see me again. Even if it's just pretend. Say you'll remember me. Standing in a nice dress. Staring at the sunset, babe. Red lips and rosy cheeks. Say you'll see me again. Even if it's just in your wildest dreams. Wildest dreams, oh. Even if it's just in your wildest dreams. In your wildest dreams, oh"
wish you were here,"Cotton candy and a rotten mouth. You know you're so fucked up. You know I couldn't help but have it for you. And everybody knows the way I walk. And knows the way I talk. And knows the way I feel about you. It's all a bunch of shit. And there's nothing to do around here. It's totally fucked up. I'm totally fucked up. Wish you were here. And streets that only turn to boulevards. And houses with back yards. and it's raining like hell on the cars. And everybody knows the way I walk. And knows the way I talk. Knows the way I feel about you. It's all a bunch of shit. And there's nothing to do around here. It's totally fucked. I'm totally fucked. Wish you were here. And if I could have my way. We'd take some drugs. And we'd smile. We'd smile. We'd smile. But not tonight, my dear. Wish you were here. Wish you were here. Wish you were here. Wish you were here."
withering heights,"I can be taught but I'm not learning. Over and over I lose. I make mistakes, get so sorry. I can't unwind like yarn from a spool. I'm a little shaky gotta learn how to fight. The moon shines on the boulevard baby let's ride. If you gotta look back, don't look down. Our love went cold and turned to ice. It's hard to see the ground. From the withering heights. From the withering heights. I can go on, but I won't bore you. Lucky in life, not in love. I make mistakes like anybody. Anyone foolish to love me that much. I'm a little shaky gotta learn how to fight. The moon shines on the boulevard, baby let's ride. If you gotta look back, don't look down. Our love went cold and turned to ice. It's hard to see the ground. From the withering heights. From the withering heights. From the withering heights. From the withering heights. From the withering heights. From the withering heights"

world war 24,"Porcelain doll. Your mother runs an antique shop. She takes some stuff, I take a lot. We sleep all day. Slow response. I'm feelin' like an afterthought. I guess I'm kinda lost in space. And London's okay. She don't even ask what time it is anymore. Dressed up like its World War 24. Sugar sweet. She loves it when it hits her teeth. The river hides the carousel. In London, oh well. Coma comes. Like bullets from a candy gun. Delivers us into the sun. Of London, my love. She don't even ask what time it is anymore. Dressed up like its World War 24. And if we get too high. We'll burn this town. We'll burn this town. We'll burn this town. Oh, baby, bring me down. Oh, baby, bring me down. Oh, baby, bring me down. Oh, baby, bring me down. I'm all yours. I'm all yours. I'm all yours"
you will always be the same,"Go on to the street to the cars in the pouring rain. Go on to the bus that left us in the dust and the flames. And when the son meets the father. It'll be something smarter for the pain. But you will always be the same. You will always be the same. Go on little girl, feet twirl, go and make him smile. Go on like the rumbling drums of the march of time. And when the son meets the dad. It'll be pretty bad for the pain. But you'll always be the same. You will always be the same. You will always be the same. Go on to the ones with the smoking guns in the heat. Go on to the wars we won, they came home, they made up. And when the father meets the son,. And the blood makes us better than the gain. You will always be the same."
