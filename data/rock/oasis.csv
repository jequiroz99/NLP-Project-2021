carnation,If you gave me a fresh carnation. I would only crush its tender petals. With me you'll have no escape. And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle. I trample down all life in my wake. I eat it up and take the cake. I just avert my eyes to the pain. Of someone's loss helping my gain. If you gave me a dream for my pocket. You'd be plugging in the wrong socket. With me there's no room for the future. With me there's no room with a view at all. I am out of season all year around. Hear machinery roar to my empty sound. Touch my heart and feel winter. Hold my hand and be doomed forever. If you gave me a fresh carnation. I would only crush its tender petals. With me you'll have no escape. And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle. And if you're wondering by now who I am. Look no further than the mirror. Cause I am the Greed and Fear. And every ounce of Hate in you.
carry us all,"I heard a whisper on my radio. But I paid no mind. I just sat back and I let it go. To catch the rain from a lonely waterfall. But I might beware. 'Cos they could drown me like a doll. They got me running in and out of time. I feel like a Bona Fide. Keeper of the right and wrong. And I've known all along, but let me just make it clear. Everybody's gone for quick, sure fire solution. But faith in any god is gonna bury us all. No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution. Have faith in what you've got and it will carry us all. Carry us all. I slip my skin as the prophets reappear. But I pay no mind. I'm just trying to persevere. With the sins I have to shake from me within. Though I might beware. 'Cos they're just trying to wear me thin. They got me running in and out of time. I feel like a Bona Fide. Keeper of the right and wrong. And I've known all along, but let me just make it clear. Everybody's gone for quick, sure fire solution. But faith in any god is gonna bury us all. No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution. Have faith in what you've got and it will carry us all.

cast no shadow,Here's a thought for everyman. Who tries to understand what is in his hand. He walks along the open road of love and life. Surviving if he can (only if he can).

Try to sit with me around my table. But never bring a chair. Does it make it all right?. It doesn't make it all right. To roll it over my soul and leave me here. Roll it over my soul and leave me here. To roll it over my soul and leave me here. Roll it over my soul and leave me here.

sad song,"Sing a sad song. In a lonely place. Try to put a word in for me. It's been so long. Since I found this place. You better put in two or three. We as people, are just walking 'round. Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground. What we don't see. Well it can't be real. What we don't touch we cannot feel. Where we're living in this town. The sun is coming up and it's going down. But it's all just the same at the end of the day. And we cheat and we lie. Nobody says it's wrong. So we don't ask why. Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day. We're throwing it all away. We're throwing it all away. We're throwing it all away at the end of the day. If you need it. Something I can give. I know I'd help you if I can. If your honest and you say that you did. You know that I would give you my hand. Or a sad song. In a lonely place. I'll try to put a word in for you. Need a shoulder? well if that's the case. You know there's nothing I wouldn't do. Where we're living in this town. The sun is coming up and it's going down. But it's all just the same at the end of the day. When we cheat and we lie. Nobody says it's wrong. So we don't ask why. Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day. Don't throw it all away. Don't throw it all away. Don't throw it all away. Don't throw it all away. Throwing it all away. Throwing it all away. Throwing it all away. Throwing it all away. Throwing it all away. You're throwing it all away at the end of the day"
scorpio rising,"When you kiss the base o'my spine. Make my body into your shrine. You give me this feeling deep inside. One that I can no longer disguise. While other snakes just shed their skins. Fucked holes pointing out my sins. Even though I realise that history's not on my side. Even though I realise the pioneer skin still curls up in my eyes. If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind. I saw a life before me but now I'm blind. I wanna go to heaven, never been there before. I wanna go to heaven, so you give me some more. Flying high upon the gallows. Too messed up to step out of the shadows. A drugged up heart that knows no sorrow. Rescued from this deep dark hole. Stick on these boots and sharpen the nails. Time is nigh for you leather girls. Maybe we should end this race. Vanish while we cannot leave no trace. If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind. I saw a life before me, but now I'm blind. See one-arm film stars on alien beaches. Potted gold and tattooed faces. Harrison murals on the corner, tupperware boxes full of hops. Diazepam dreams there catching streams. Paper dinosaurs flash blue and green. Still I've got a flash-bulb head. Still I've got a flash-bulb head. If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind. I saw a life before me but now I'm blind. I wanna go to heaven, never been there before. I wanna go to heaven, so you give me some more. Come along nice, come along dead. Scorpio rising, and paint it red. A psychic equalizer in your head. Come along nice, come along dead. Scorpio rising, and paint it red."
