have you ever seen the rain?,"Someone told me long ago. There's a calm before the storm. I know. It's been coming for some time. When it's over, so they say. It'll rain a sunny day. I know. Shinin' down like water. I wanna know. Have you ever seen the rain?. I wanna know. Have you ever seen the rain. Comin' down on a sunny day?. Yesterday and days before. Sun is cold and rain is hot.

the way you look tonight,"Some day, when I'm awfully low. When the world is cold. I will feel a glow just thinking of you. And the way you look tonight. You're so lovely, with your smile so warm. And your cheek so soft. There is nothing for me but to love you. And the way you look tonight. With each word your tenderness grows. Tearing my fears apart. And that laugh that wrinkles your nose. Touches my foolish heart. Yes you're lovely, never ever change. Keep that breathless charm. Won't you please arrange it?. 'Cause I love you. Just the way you look tonight. With each word your tenderness grows. Tearing my fears apart. And that laugh that wrinkles your nose. Touches my foolish heart. Yes you're lovely, never ever change. Keep that breathless charm.

look in her eyes,"See the line all around the block. Watch all the pretty girls looking roguishly hot. Right on time, here come all the dudes. They work the room and validate their crew. (Oh yeah). It's not submission, it's just the look in her eyes. There's no decision, it's just the look in her eyes. The Johnny is jumping, the Dj's settin' 'em free. Johnny from Brooklyn meets Marianne from Queens. They hit it off, he has all the moves. She's fascinated but leaves him looking for clues. She's not pretending, it's just the look in her eyes. She's not suggesting, it's just the look in her eyes. He leads her by the hand, he says ""Dance little sister, dance"". Is it one those nights where the stars and the moon collide, aw yeah. Don't be fooled by the look in her eyes. [?]. The sun is rising, he says I'll walk you home. He's got the sweet talk, she's in her comfort zone. He's so smooth, he always gets the girl. But she ain't fooled, her mother taught her well. It's not submission, it's just the look in her eyes. There's no decision, it's just the look in her eyes.

you're in my heart (the final acclaim),"I didn't know what day it was. when you walked into the room. I said hello unnoticed. You said goodbye too soon. Breezing through the clientele. spinning yarns that were so lyrical. I really must confess right here. the attraction was purely physical. I took all those habits of yours. that in the beginning were hard to accept. Your fashion sense, Beardsly prints. I put down to experience. The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent. who tried to change my point of view. Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed. but my heart cried out for you. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul. My love for you is immeasurable. My respect for you immense. You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness. You're beauty and elegance. You're a rhapsody, a comedy. You're a symphony and a play. You're every love song ever written. But honey what do you see in me. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul. You're an essay in glamour. Please pardon the grammar. but you're every schoolboy's dream. You're Celtic, United,. but baby I've decided. You're the best team I've ever seen. And there have been many affairs. Many times I've thought to leave. But I bite my lip and turn around. 'cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul"

when i need you,"(Carol Bayer Sager, Albert Hammond). When I need you. I just close my eyes and I'm with you. And all that I so want to give you. it's only a heart beat away. When I need love. I hold out my hand and I touch love. I never knew there was so much love. keeping me warm night and day. Miles and miles of empty space in between us. A telephone can't take the place of your smile. But you know I won't be traveling forever. It's cold out but hold out and do like I do. When I need you. I just close my eyes and I'm with you. And all that I so want to give you baby. it's only a heart beat away. It's not easy when the road is your driver. Honey that's a heavy load that we bear. But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime. It's cold out so hold out and do like I do. When I need you. When I need love. I hold out my hands and I touch love. I never knew there was so much love. keeping me warm night and day. When I need you. I close my eyes. I hold out my hand and I've got you darlin'. It's only a heart beat away. Now listen. When I need you darlin'. I hold you, feel ya. Give it to me baby.

my heart can't tell you no,"I don't want you to come round here no more,. I beg you for mercy.. You don't know how strong my weakness is. Or how much it hurts me.. Cause when you say it over with him,. I want to believe it's true.. So I let you in, knowing tomorrow. I'm gonna wake up missing you,. Wake up missing you.. When the one you love's in love with someone else,. Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell.. No matter how I try to convince myself,. This time I won't lose control.. One look in your blue eyes. and suddenly my heart can't tell you no.. I don't want you to call me up no more,. Saying you need me.. You're crazy if you think just half your love. Could ever please me.. Still I want to hold you, touch you. When you look at me that way.. There's only one solution I know:. You gotta stay away from me,. Stay away from me!. When the one you love's in love with someone else,. Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell.. No matter how I try to convince myself,. This time I won't lose control..

every beat of my heart,"Through these misty eyes. I see lonely skies. Lonely road to Babylon. Where's my family. And my country. Heaven knows where I belong. Pack my bags tonight. Here's one Jacobite. Who must leave or surely die. Put me on a train. In the pouring rain. Say farewell but don't say goodbye. Chorus:. Seagull carry me, over land and sea. To my own folk, that's where I want to be. Every beat of my heart. Tears me further apart. I'm lost and alone in the dark. I'm going home. One more glass of wine. Just for auld lang syne. And the girl I left behind. How I miss her now. In my darkest hour. And the way our arms entwine. Chorus. And we'll drink a toast. To the blood red rose. Cheer a while the Emerald Isle. And to the northern lights. And the swirling pipes. How they make a grown man cry. Chorus"
maggie may,"Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you. It's late September and I really should be back at school. I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used. Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more. You led me away from home just to save you from being alone. You stole my heart and that's what really hurts. The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age. But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything. I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax. Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more. You led me away from home, just to save you from being alone. You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without. All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand. But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover. You wore me out. All you did was wreck my bed. And in the morning kick me in the head. Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore. You led me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone. You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried. I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school. Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool. Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand. Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face. You made a first-class fool out of me. But I'm as blind as a fool can be. You stole my heart but I love you anyway. (guitar bit again). Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face. I'll get on back home one of these days"

it's over,"The congregation sang. We knelt and prayed. As we stood before God. On that beautiful day. The church bells rang. And the champagne flowed. As our friends gathered round. For the wedding photo. But here we are barely five years on. And our whole world's fallin' apart. All the plans we had together. Up in smoke and gone for ever. Poisoned by the lawyer's letter. It's over. I don't want our kids to suffer. Can we talk to one another. You were once my light, my lover. It's over. Rumours and whispers tear me apart. That I know you better than that. Inseparable were we. With a breeze in our sails. Now I feel a chill wind. On the marriage that failed. well our firends are all divided. They've taken their sides. Now they'll all sit back. And watch the circus unwind. I don't stand here tryin' to focus the blame. But I'm hurtin' deep down inside. All the pain and all the grievin'. When did we stop believin'. Too late now to stop the bleedin'. It's over. What's the sense in pointin' fingers. Who's the saint and who's the sinner. There ain't gonna be a winner. It's over. Oh, my dear, what happened to us?. Tell me, where did it all go wrong?. What's the use in keep on fightin'. All the tears, all the cryin'. Why do we keep denyin'. It's over. In all the time I thought I knew ya.

farewell (2018),"All dressed up on a Friday night. Getting drunk on cheap red wine. Two north London boys just out on the town. Catch a train up to cool Soho. The Marquee and The Flamingo. Pills and chills and girls in heels and Georgie Fame, yeah. Making out we were millionaires. Anything to get the girl upstairs. What was it you said, humour before looks works every time. Skinny ties and mohair suits. White boys can't sing the blues. This was our time, our space, our songs, our generation. And I'll never know again. Someone as genuine. Someone as wonderful as you. And I can't believe you're gone. That's why I wrote this song. Goodbye my old friend. I'll miss you, yes, I will. So long my best pal. I'll miss you, yes, I will. Oh you, yeah you. Were like a brother to me. Take a walk down Wardour street. In the pub where we used to meet. I step inside and I imagine you're there. Dolled up in a hound's-tooth suit. Buttoned down shirt and Chelsea boots. We had a bond that should've lasted a lifetime. But I hope you're looking down. And I hope I made you proud. What I'd give to see you in the crowd tonight, ahh yeah. And when we meet again. There will be no end. Just me and you man. Goodbye my old friend. I'll miss you, yes, I will. Yeah, so long my best pal. I'll miss you, yes, I will. Oh you, yeah you. Were like a brother to me. Intellect and common sense. Means nothing at all if you sit on the fence. Anarchy is for the foolhardy. Why rail against society. Aim high, reach for the sky. How you gonna know unless you try. These are your words, not mine. So long old friend. Goodbye my old friend. I'll miss you, yes, I will. So long my best pal. I'll miss you, yes, I will. Oh you, yeah you. Were a brother to me"
rhythm of my heart,"Across the street, the river runs. Down in the gutter, life is slipping away. Let me still exist in another place. Running undercover of a helicopter blade. The flames are getting higher in effigy. Burning down the bridges of my memory. Love may still be alive somewhere, some day. Where they're downing only deer. A hundred steel towns away. Oh, the rhythm of my heart. Is beating like a drum. With the words ""I love you"". Rolling off my tongue. No, never will I roam. For I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky. I'll be sailing. Photographs and kerosene. Light up my darkness, light it up, light it up. I can still feel the touch. Of your thin blue jeans. Running down the alley. I've got my eyes all over you baby, oh baby. Oh, the rhythm of my heart. Is beating like a drum. With the words ""I love you"". Rolling off my tongue. No, never will I roam. For I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky. I'll be sailing (bis). (Bridge). Oh, I've got lightning in my veins. Shifting like the handle of a slot machine. Love may still exist in another place. I'm just yanking back the handle, no expression on my face. Oh, the rhythm of my heart. Is beating like a drum. With the words ""I love you"". Rolling off my tongue. Oh, never will I roam. For I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky. I'll be sailing. The rhythm of my heart. Is beating like a drum. With the words ""I love you"". Rolling off my tongue. Never will I roam. For I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky. I'll be sailing."
young turks,"(Rod Stewart / Carmine Appice, Kevin Savigar, Duane Hitchings). Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams.. He said somehow, some way, it's gotta get better than this.. Patti packed her bags, left a note for her momma, she was just seventeen,. there were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye.. They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so excited.. We got just one shot of life, let's take it while we're still not afraid..

didn't i (feat. bridget cady),"There are times to remember and times that I wish to forget. Our time together was tinged with love and regret. Oh my girl, my sweet, sweet little girl.

And times that I wish to forget"
(i know) i'm losing you,"(N. Whitfield / E. Holland / C. Grant). Your love is fading I can feel your love fading. Woman it's fading away from me. 'Cause your personal touch has grown cold. as if someone else controls your very soul. I fooled myself long as I can. I can feel the presence of another man. It's there when you speak my name. It's just not the same. Oh honey I'm losing you. I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere. Oh I'm losing you. I can feel it in my bones. any day you'll be up and gone. Ooh I'm losing you. It's all over your face someone's takin' my place. Could it be that I'm losing you. When I look into your eyes a reflection of a face I see. Oh Lord I'm losing you. I'm hurt, downhearted and worried girl. 'cause that face doesn't belong to me. Your love is fadin', I can feel it fadin'. Oh away from me. I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere. ooh I'm losing you. I don't wanna lose you. but I know I'm gonna groove you. Oh Lord I'm losing you, and I'm a losin' you. Your love is fadin', I can feel it fadin'. Oh Lord I'm losing you."
(if loving you is wrong) i don't want to be right,"If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. If being right means being without you. I'd rather live a wrong doing life.

If I can't see you when I want to. I'll see you when I can. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right. If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right.

(you make me feel like) a natural man,"(G. Goffin / C. King / J. Wexler). Looking out on the morning rain. I used to feel so uninspired. But when I knew I had to face another long, long day. girl I used to feel so tired. Before the day I met you. life had been so unkind. but you're the key to my peace of mind. 'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel. you made me feel like a natural man. When my soul was in the lost and found. you came along to claim it. I didn't know, I didn't know just what was wrong with me. till your kiss helped me to name it. Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for. but if I make you happy I don't need to do more. 'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel. you made me feel like a natural man. Oo baby, baby look what you have done to me. Can't you see that you made me feel so good inside. Don't you know that I just want to be. close to you, you made me feel so alive. 'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel. you made me feel like a natural man. Baby I ain't doubtful of what I'm living for. but if I make you happy I don't need to do more. 'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel. Well you made me feel like a natural man."
a friend for life,"Througha smoke-filled glass on a desperate night. When the sole of my shoe lets in rain. When the heart's tired of running. and the milk's gone sour. Will your feelings still be the same?. When the match won't light so the flames don't tremble. And the years are condemning us too. I'll need a soulmate to hold me. and a friend for life. And I'm hoping it might be you. When I think of life as a chance not taken. Or as a compromise tinged with regret. When the kids leave for breeding and the Tv's king. Will you tell me we're not done yet?. Will you think of me as a distant island. Or will you come with me to the moon?. I'll need a soulmate to hold me. and a friend for life. And I'm hoping it might be you. Give me asylum and I'll keep the faith. Keep me in coffee and so safe. And I'll feed your cats and I'll paint walls. And I'll be your one night stand. Will you come with me in the certain knowledge. That the catch is there's no catch at all?. I'll need a soulmate to hold me. and a friend for life. And I'm hoping it might be you. Yes, I'm certain it must be you"

a night like this,"Sixteen years old, looking for a hideaway. I'm a set designer, my Mum and Dad. thinking I'm gay. I'm a lazy bugger, but I like my sport. Like girls and music, I'm happy, happy sort. (of a guy). But there's one thing I'm lacking. it's sexual experience. So I ask you, my sweetheart. save me from this wilderness. I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this. Where I come from, love is. just a hole in the wall. And the steel mills ring out and generations. heed the call. And the rain never stops and the skies are grey. And the chance of romance. slim as a bright sunny day. This is partly the reason. I'm so overwhelmed and shy. Because your beauty, by contrast. is gonna make a young man cry. I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this. I've schemed, honey, of a night like this. You don't know what it means to a boy from. a suburban home. To be left with a woman like you. completely alone. I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this. Nice place you've got here, babe. never seen a house like this. Pool like an ocean, bed like a football pitch. All the guys at the boozer, won't believe my luck. But it couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke. (than me). So here we are, the record's. gotten stuck in the groove. My knees are trembling, c'mon baby, make a move. I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this. I've schemed, honey, of a night like this. I've dreamed, I've schemed, honey. of a night like this. I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this"
a reason to believe,(Tim Hardin). If I listened long enough to you. I'd find a way to believe that it's all true. Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried. Still I look to find a reason to believe. Someone like you makes it hard to live without. somebody else. Someone like you makes it easy to give. never think about myself. If I gave you time to change my mind. I'd find a way just to leave the past behind. Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried. Still I look to find a reason to believe. If I listened long enough to you. I'd find a way to believe that it's all true. Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried. Still I look to find a reason to believe.

alright for an hour,"(Rod Stewart, Jessie Ed Davis, 1975/76). Oh, didn't I mess around like ev'rybody did?. I said, "" Woman, you're foolin' around with a man that just don't fit."".

amazing grace,"(words & music traditional). Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now am found. Was blind but now I see. It was grace that taught my heart to fear. And grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believed. Through many dangers, toils and snares. I have already come. 'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far. And grace will lead me home. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds. In a believer's ear. It soothes his sorrows, heals the wounds. And drives away his fear. Must Jesus bear the cross alone. And all the world go free. No, there's a cross for ev'ry one. And there's a cross for me. ."

Tried to light ... a lift but all in vain. With your sock on your head. and that old coat on your back. to keep you from the drizzlin' rain. oh to keep you from the drizzlin' rain. Goodbye. One more time. Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed. Laid your head on a ...... With the Times on your face. and that old coat on your back. That kept you from a-withering away good God. It just kept you from a-withering away. I know. And did you ride a lift on a steam train. Now listen. Had the misfortune not to pay your fare. Thrown off the next stop. Thrown in the doorway of a shop. With that coat to keep you from the wind. Oh that old school coat to keep you from the wind. And that ain't all. Have you had some good friends on the road with ya. who'd stand by you through thick and thin. Here's to Kevin and Ben, Susie and Len. And that coat which never lets you down.

angel,"(J. Hendrix). Angel came down from heaven yesterday. stayed with me long enough to rescue me. And she told me a story yesterday. about the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea. Then she spread her wings high over me. she said she's going now, come back tomorrow. And I said, ""Fly on my sweet angel, fly on through the sky. Fly on my sweet angel, FOREVER I WILL BE by your side"". Fly away, ( a brand new day ). Sure enough this morning came unto me. silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise. And my angel she said unto me. Today's the day for you to rise. Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise. Then she took me high over yonder. And I said, ""Fly on my sweet angel, fly on through the sky. Fly on my sweet angel forever I will be by your side"". And I said, ""Fly on my sweet angel, fly on through the sky. Fly on my sweet angel forever I will be by your side"". Fly away, come back another day"
another country,"Every day I'm awake. I've been thinking about you. And I can't get you over my mind. You're the girl of my dreams. The mother of my children. I'm as proud as any man can be alive. As the wind blows heavy down the mountain side. And the darkness of night closes in. As I lie in my bed. I can hear your heart pounding. Far away in another country. Far away in another country. And I dream of the day. We'll be packing up and leaving. This God-forsaken corner of the world. All the boys getting taller?. Is your tummy getting broader?. Do we know if it's a boy or it's a girl?. And I reach ouy to touch you in the middle of the night. And I swear you're lying next to me. But you're not, I'm awake. With my poor heart aching. Far away in another country. Far away in another country. One of these bright sunny days. I'll be coming down that road again. My journey had an end. God bless you until then. How I miss, how I miss. The colour of the springtime. And the moonlight shining through your hair. Say hello to my friends. And all of our kindred. Tell 'em I will soon be there. There's a tear in my eye as I try to sleep. Are the boys still calling out my name?. Tell 'em daddy's in a fight. Between good and evil. Far away in another country. Far away in another country"
another heartache,"(B. Adams, J. Vallance, R. Stewart, R. Wayne). I told you once I'm a jealous man. But you never want to listen to who I am. We're divided, completely out of touch. I guess that's why we seem to fight so much. Believe me darling this ain't no game. If you think I'll be your fool. You better think again. I know you love me. It just ain't right. I'm sick and tired of fighting. with you every night. You say you don't wanna hurt me. But you're doing things I can't explain. Oh baby, why don't you leave me. Because I know you'll never change. It's only another heartache. Ain't nothing to worry about. Something I'm getting used to. Dragging my heart around. But one day soon. And it won't be long. Gonna find me an angel to carry me home. It's only another heartache. Ain't nothing to worry about. I'll find a honey to take a chance. And roll that dice into my past. She'll cover me for a little while. And show me love ain't out of style. I don't care how long it takes. My heart's in the hands of fate. Oh God I ain't asking much. Just a woman that I can trust. It's only another heartache.

around the plynth,"Woken up on mornings such as this. And thought exactly the same as I'm thinking now. Every night for a year I've slept alone. Cold damp room looks worse than me, no no no. Got a fear of death that creeps on every night. I know I won't die soon, but then again I might. Water down the drain, I'm wasting away. And doctors can't help me a ghost of a man that's me. No no. Water down the drain goes to the sea. The pattern of my life keeps a-haunting me. Moisture from the ocean fills the sky. Come on down to the ground as the time goes by. No no no no no. Slow down there. I never found out the reason why. Why my parents had to lie. About the place that I was born. And from my hometown I was torn. At the tender age of four. I was livin' by a homemade law. I never knew when it was to be laid. My desires are never displayed. I never knew what it was to be loved. I never knew what it was to be laid. I never knew what it was to win. I never knew what it was to be loved, nonono. Ah, get on up there. I never knew what it was to be loved. I never knew what it was to be laid. Nonononono. Slow down there"
as time goes by,"This day and age we're living in. Gives cause for apprehension. With speed and new invention. And things like third dimension. Yet we get a trifle weary. With Mr. Einstein's theory. So we must get down to earth at times. Relax relieve the tension. And no matter what the progress. Or what may yet be proved. The simple facts of life are such. They cannot be removed. You must remember this. A kiss is still a kiss,. A sigh is just a sigh. The fundamental things apply. As time goes by. And when two lovers woo. They still say, ""I love you"". On that you can rely. No matter what the future brings. As time goes by. Moonlight and love songs. Never out of date. Hearts full of passion. Jealousy and hate. Woman needs man. And man must have his mate. That no one can deny. Well, it's still the same old story. A fight for love and glory. A case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers. As time goes by. (Queen Latifah) Times don't change, right?. (Rod Stewart) Sing it to me, Latifah. Oh, I'm singing it to you right now. Cause we're talking about. Moonlight and love songs. Never out of date.

borstal boys,"(Ian McLagan, Ron Wood, Rod Stewart). Cell block five, how I hate Bromide. With your coffee in the morning makes you so sterile. The corner gang never made a man of me boy. You know the walls are tall and the inmates scheme. There's no one here thatâ€™s more than seventeen. Bet your life there's a riot tonight in the mess hall. listen. A letter from your home town makes you sad. You read it when the wardens had a second laugh. He said sentimental rubbish ain't got no place in here boy. See the years roll on by. such a senseless waste of time. What a way to reform. Call out your number. who's a nonconformer,. not me baby, oh yeah. Shakey Brown didn't hang around. when a Molotow didn't do its stuff. You went back in there and said it with a sawed-off shotgun. You know Poker Sam couldn't lose a hand. If he did you were hit by a downtown tram. Or crushed in the path of a moving elevator, elevator. See the years roll on by. such a senseless waste of time. What a way to reform. Call out your number. who's a nonconformer,. not me baby, oh yeah. When I get out, I'll get straight. If this old world gives me half a break. But, if you see me in the corner with a chip on my shoulder. Don't blame me, don't blame me baby, no, no. Got to make a break for the county line."

brighton beach,"Remember when you were only 17. You were the finest girl that my eyes had ever seen. I guess you found it hard to simply just ignore. This scruffy beat up working class teenage troubadour. So we fell in love and I tuned your heart. With my out of tune guitar. You were wonderful, you were mystical. And the envy of all of my friends. Seems like only yesterday. Under the stars on brighton beach. Oh what a time it was. What a time to be alive. Remember janice and jimmy. Kennedy and king. How they cried. I sang to you the songs of lamb and jack. You were greta garbo and I was cadillac. And we played so hard and we loved so hard. Seemed we never ever slept. There were crazy days, there were wonderful days. And I loved you with all of my heart. Seems like only yesterday. Under the stars on brighton beach. Your daddy had plans that did not include me. And he won't stay away from your door. And I dreamed how I dreamed I could steal you away. To some far distant shore. Then early one morning. I awoke to find you gone. You wrote 'I love you baby. But it's time for me to move on'. And so my teenage heart laid scattered on the floor. I swear to god I could not have loved you anymore. And as I sit here the night, playing with my kids. Wondering where you are in this world. Did you find your man, are you happy now?. Do you ever stop and think about me. How I long for yesterday. Under the stars on brighton beach"

broken arrow,"(Chorus). Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?. Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?. There he goes moving across the water. There he goes turning my whole world around. Do you feel what I feel. Can we make it so that's part of the deal. I've gotta hold you in these arms of steel. Lay your heart on the line this time. I wanna breathe when you breathe. When you whisper like that hot summer breeze. Count the beads of sweat that cover me. Didn't you show me a sign this time. (Chorus). Do you feel what I feel. Do you feel what I feel. Can you see what I see. Can you cut behind the mystery. I will meet you by the witness tree. Leave the whole world behind. I wanna come when you call. I'll get to you if I have to crawl. They can't hold me with these iron walls. We got mountains to climb, to climb. (Chorus). Turning my whole world around..."
but not for me,"They're writing songs of love, but not for me.. A lucky star's above, but not for me.. With love to lead the way. I've found more clouds of grey. than any Russain play could guarantee.. I was a fool to fall and get that way;. Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day!. Although I can't dismiss the mem'ry of her kiss, I. guess she's not for me.. He's knocking on a door, but not for me.. He'll plan a two by four, but not for me.. I know that love's a game;. I'm puzzled, just the same,. was I the moth or flame?. I'm all at sea.. It all began so well, but what an end!. This is the time a feller needs a friend,. when ev'ry happy plot ends with the marriage knot,. and there's no knot for me."
camouflage,"(Stewart / Savigar / Omartian). She came to the party. In a leather number wrapped in chains. Investigation found. She was very fond of dropping names. So I signed her book. And drove her to her home. And she looked so hot. Started to come on strong. Then she said so candidly. As I was gettin' down on my knees. ""I don't really mean to tease. But I'm shy, shy, shy, shy, shy"". Camouflage. That's nothin' but camouflage. He was totally handsome. With a winning personality. Natural born leader. With connections in society. But late at night. Alone with just his wealth. He would stare in the mirror. And never see himself. He had a cadillac thirty foot long. He had a hit with every song. Sounded like something's wrong. Why, why, why, why, why. Camouflage. It ain't nothin' but camouflage. Camouflage. Ain't nothing but, nothin' but. Nothin' but camouflage. They were so well suited. With an ambience you can't ignore. But nobody realized. What went on behind closed doors. He had many affairs. But never felt fulfilled. She would hide her sadness. In alcohol and pills. She bottled everything up inside. He was too busy with his best friend's wife. They couldn't look each other in the eyes. Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies. Camouflage. Just camouflage. Everywhere you go it's called camouflage. Some people hide behind camouflage. C-A-M-O-U-F-L-A-G-E. I signed her book, drove her to her home. But I didn't know what was goin' on. He had a cadillac thirty foot long. Had hits with every song. He had many affairs but never felt fulfilled. She was hidin' herself in some little purple pills. Why, why, why, why. Shy, shy, shy, shy. Lies, lies, lies, lies. Lies, lies, lies, lies. Camouflage, camouflage. Talkin' 'bout camouflage. camouflage, bring it down. Sometimes I worry about you darlin'. You wear too much mascara. Too much eyeliner. Too much rouge, and it worries me. Camouflage, camouflage. Camouflage, talkin' 'bout camouflage."

can we still be friends,"Can We Still Be Friends?. ~by Todd Rundgren. We can't play this game anymore but. Can we still be friends?. Things just can't go on like before but. Can we still be friends?. We had something to learn. Now it's time for the wheel to turn.. Grains of sand, one by one. Before you know it, all gone.. Let's admit we made a mistake but. Can we still be friends?. Heartbreak's never easy to take but. Can we still be friends?. It's a strange, sad affair. Sometimes seems like we just don't care.. Don't waste time feeling hurt. We've been through hell together.. Can we still be friends?. Can we still get together sometimes?. Can we still be friends?. You know that life will still go on.. We awoke from our dream. Things are not always what they seem.. Memories linger on. It's like a sweet, sad, old song.."
can't stop me now,I spit on the streets in san. Called the record and company man. My enthusiasm filled the room. I was young and I was keen. With the devil in my stream. As I hollowed at an old blues tune. We can't sign your sign. 'Cause we're doper than the mole. That you had on your nose and your clothes. I should thank you gentleman. For this life that you brought me. Now move on down the road. I remember how I used to say. They can't stop me now. The world is waiting. It's my turn to stand out in the crowd. They can't stop me now. The tide is turning. I'm gonna make you proud. Well nothing was tough. But I couldn't get enough. Out this rhythm and blues I crave. I was singing in the parks. Singing in the clubs. Then along came agony. All the things he said to me. And all the things I heard. I had a point to prove. I will climb this mountain. With this god given gift. If it's the last thing that I do. And I remember thinking. They can't stop me now. The world is waiting. It's my turn to stand out in the crowd. They can't stop me now. The tide is turning. I'm gonna make you proud. Born to ramble. Born to sing. In a new world of rock n roll. Woman in particular. Feel my heart will cry. And if I hold my song. Thanks for the faith. Thanks for the patience. Thanks for the helping hand. Thanks for the love. Thanks for the guidance. Thanks for the talk and pride. They can't stop me now. The world is waiting. It's my turn to stand out in the crowd. They can't stop me now. The tide is turning. I'm gonna make you proud

cloud nine (with python lee jackson),"The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty, see. I was born and raised in the slums of the city. It was a one-room shack.

And oh Lord it's you I wanna wed. It's you that I wanna wed."

dirty old town,"(Ewan McColl). Found my love by the gaswork croft. Dreamed a dream by the old canal. Kissed my girl by the factory wall. Dirty old town, dirty old town. I heard a siren from the dock. Saw a train set the night on fire. Smelled the spring on the sulfured wind. Dirty old town, whoa-oh, dirty old town. We're goin' to take a good sharp axe. Shining steel tempered in the fire. And we'll chop you down like an old dead tree. Dirty old town, dirty old town. Dirty old town, whoa-oh, dirty old town. And oh we'll chop you down. Oh, dirty, dirty, dirty old town. Dirty old town, dirty old town. And oh whoa-oh dirty old town. Chop you down one of these days."

dixie toot,"(R. Stewart / R. Wood). Sitting on my back door wondering which way to go. The sun's shining on my back and it hurts (child). The Fm station plays another bad 45. And it's been so long since I had a good time. It's been so long since I had a good time. Never wrecked my head on a bandstand. in the trombone or clarinet line. When I come in heat on Bourbon Street for Mardi Gras. When those for a cryin' just stay behind in the bar. 'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time. Yeah it's been so long since I had a good time. I'm gonna lose control of my powers. I might even lose my trousers. Smash some glass, act like trash if I want. Wear a skirt be a flirt if I want. 'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time. This prodigal man from Dixieland needs a good time. right now, show me a good time right now. You better take it while you can. You gotta get it while you can. And when the Man Upstairs he calls me. He'll say ""It's your turn son to come"". Don't play the blues down in old Toulouse for me. Let sleighbells ring and children sing in the street. And tell all of my friends that I had a good time. Open up the sky won't you ride me high. Let's have a good time. And if I'm late at heaven's gate blame a good time. And when the angels sing I will join in. Let's have a good time really. I took my luck, I didn't give a fuck, I had a good time. Tell all my friends only all my best to have a good time. Goodbye"

On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry. sailing on my way back here. I fell in love with a slit eyed lady. by the light of an eastern moon. Shangai Lil never used the pill. She claimed that it just ain't natural. She took me up on deck and bit my neck. Oh people I was glad I found her. Oh yeah I was glad I found her. I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me. I sincerely thought I was so complete. Look how wrong you can be. The women I've known. I wouldn't let tie my shoe. They wouldn't give you the time of day. But the slit eyed lady knocked me off my feet. God I was glad I found her. And if they had the words I could tell to you. to help you on the way down the road. I couldn't quote you no Dickens, Shelley or Keats. 'cause it's all been said before. Make the best out of the bad just laugh it off. You didn't have to come here anyway. So remember, every picture tells a story don't it"

everything i own,"Everything I Own\"". [Originally by Bread]. You sheltered me from harm. Kept me warm, kept me warm. You gave my life to me. Set me free, set me free. The finest years I ever knew. Were all the years I had with you. I would give anything I own. Give up me life, my heart, my home. I would give everything I own. Just to have you back again. You taught me how to love. What its of, what its of. You never said too much. But still you showed the way. And I knew from watching you. Nobody else could ever know. The part of me that can\'t let go. I would give anything I own. Give up me life, my heart, my home. I would give everything I own. Just to have you back again. Is there someone you know. You\'re loving them so. But taking them all for granted. You may lose them one day. Someone takes them away. And they don\'t hear the words you long to say. I would give anything I own. Give up me life, my heart, my home. I would give everything I own. Just to have you back again"
everytime we say goodbye,Everytime we say goodbye. I die a little. Everytime we say goodbye. I wonder why a little. Why the gods above me. Who must be in the know. Think so little of me. They allow you to go. And when you're near. There's such an air of spring about it. I can hear a lark. Somewhere begin to sing about it. There's no love song finer. But how strange the change. From major to minor. Everytime we say goodbye. When you're near. There's such an air of spring about it. I can hear a lark. Somewhere begin to sing about it. There's no love song finer. But how strange the change. From major to minor. Everytime we say goodbye. Everytime we say goodbye
faith of the heart,It's been a long road. To get from there to here. It's been a long time. But my time is finally here. And I can feel a change in the wind right now. Nothing's in my way. And they're not gonna hold me down no more. No they're not gonna hold me down. (Chorus). 'Cause I've got faith of the heart. I'm going where my heart will take me. I've got faith to believe. I can do anything. I've got strength of the soul. And no one's going to bend nor break me. I can reach any star. I've got faith of the heart. It's been a long night. Trying to find my way. Been through the darkness. Now I finally have my day. And I will see my dream come alive at last. I will touch the sky. And they're not gonna hold me down no more. No they're not gonna change my mind. (Chorus). I know the wind's so cold. I've seen the darkest days. But now the winds I feel. Are only winds of change. I've been through the fire. And I've been through the rain. But I'll be fine. (Chorus).
farewell,"Fare thee well my brother. please don't stand in my way. I'm going down to that dirty town. no matter what you say. You fooled me and you ruled me. and you played in every part. I gotta go, it's no use me stayin' home. Goodbye my sister. please don't let me see you cry. Gonna be a star some day. no matter what they say. And when you hear the crowds. all callin' and shouting out my name. until then, my little friend, I'll be unsatisfied. So long sweet Melinda. don't forget that you're my girl. Gonna dress you fine. and if you give me time. make you proud like I said I would. And if the Champs Elysee's no fallacy. If I find the world looks like it should.

farewell (2018),"All dressed up on a Friday night. Getting drunk on cheap red wine. Two north London boys just out on the town. Catch a train up to cool Soho. The Marquee and The Flamingo. Pills and chills and girls in heels and Georgie Fame, yeah. Making out we were millionaires. Anything to get the girl upstairs. What was it you said, humour before looks works every time. Skinny ties and mohair suits. White boys can't sing the blues. This was our time, our space, our songs, our generation. And I'll never know again. Someone as genuine. Someone as wonderful as you. And I can't believe you're gone. That's why I wrote this song. Goodbye my old friend. I'll miss you, yes, I will. So long my best pal. I'll miss you, yes, I will. Oh you, yeah you. Were like a brother to me. Take a walk down Wardour street. In the pub where we used to meet. I step inside and I imagine you're there. Dolled up in a hound's-tooth suit. Buttoned down shirt and Chelsea boots. We had a bond that should've lasted a lifetime. But I hope you're looking down. And I hope I made you proud. What I'd give to see you in the crowd tonight, ahh yeah. And when we meet again. There will be no end. Just me and you man. Goodbye my old friend. I'll miss you, yes, I will. Yeah, so long my best pal. I'll miss you, yes, I will. Oh you, yeah you. Were like a brother to me. Intellect and common sense. Means nothing at all if you sit on the fence. Anarchy is for the foolhardy. Why rail against society. Aim high, reach for the sky. How you gonna know unless you try. These are your words, not mine. So long old friend. Goodbye my old friend. I'll miss you, yes, I will. So long my best pal. I'll miss you, yes, I will. Oh you, yeah you. Were a brother to me"

flags and banners,"(Rod Stewart, Ronnie Lane, 1973). [vocals by Ronnie Lane]. Last night I was woken by my cry. Had a dream just as plain as you and I. Saw the morning sun on a woodland in the spring. Still hear the echo crashing through the trees. Oh when I saw you down I fell upon my knees. You and I we were wearing Southern Grey. I called to you, but I used another name. I beat the ground and I cried out in your pain. But through a scarlet door I watched you slipping away. And your brothersâ€™ helpless prayers were all in vain. Last night I was woken by my cry."

foolish behaviour,"(Rod Stewart / Savigar, Cregan, Grainger). Can I introduce myself. I'm a man of panache and wealth. Sound in mind, body, soul and health. Why I wanna kill my wife. I have the urge to take her life. Been planing for years to get rid of her. Not divorce I really do mean to kill her. She's so full of useless information and trivia. That's why I wanna kill my wife. I have a duty to take her life. Her stupid friends get right up my nose. They all wear annoyingly sensible clothes. They're all so bleeding grandiose,. You know why I should kill her friends. They're all driving Mercedes Benz.. He'll escape down into Mexico. Sell the house and find a nice young girl. He'll laugh and sing and he won't work anymore.. Should I string her up or strangle her in bed. Suffocate that little venomous head. Or perhaps I'll just whip her to death. Listen do me a favor kill my wife. Do it for mankind take her life. Or should I act quite cold and deliberate. Or maybe blow out her brains with a bullet. They'll think suicide they won't know who done it. I'm gonna kill my wife I'm really gonna take her life.. He'll escape down into Mexico. Sell the house and find a nice young girl. He'll laugh and sing and he won't work anymore. The moment of truth has come. I'm at the point of no return. I've got my hands locked round her throat. I'm about to kill my wife. Don't stop me now I'm gonna take her life. Too late now I'm gonna kill my wife. Can't help myself I'm gonna take her life.

gasoline alley,"I think I know now what's making me sad. It's a yearnin' for my own back yard. I realize maybe I was wrong to leave. Better swallow up my silly country pride. Going home, running home. Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from. Going home, and I'm running home. down to Gasoline Alley where I was born. When the weather's better and the rails unfreeze. and the wind don't whistle 'round my knees. I'll put on my weddin' suit and catch the evening train. I'll be home before the milk's upon the door. Going home, running home. down to Gasoline Alley where I started from. Going home, and I'm running home. down to Gasoline Alley where I was born. But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong. Should I stray to the house on the hill. Let it be known that my intentions were good. I'd be singing in my alley if I could. And if I'm called away and it's my turn to go. Should the blood run cold in my veins. Just one favor I'll be asking of you. Don't bury me here, it's too cold. Take me back, carry me back. Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from. Take me back, won't you carry me home. Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from. Take me back, carry me back. Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from. Take me back, carry me back. Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from. Take me back, carry me back. Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from"

girl from the north country,"(Bob Dylan). If you're traveling in the north country fair. Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline. Remember me to the one who lives there. She was once a true love of mine. And if you're goin' when the snowflakes storm. When the rivers freeze and summer ends. Please see for me she has a coat so warm. to keep her from the howling wind. Would you see for me that her hair's hanging long. That it rolls and flows all down her breasts. See for me that her hair's hanging long. 'Cause that's the way I remember her best. But I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all. Many times I've often prayed. in the darkness of my night. in the brightness of my day. So if you're traveling in the north country fair. Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline. Remember me to the one who lives there. 'Cause she was once, she was once a true love of mine. And she'll always be a true love of mine. And I never, never, never, never give her up."

here to eternity,"(R. Stewart, K. Savigar). On a hot summer's night. In the year of '75. Jimmy Doyle took his child bride. Amanda, for a drive. She was only seventeen. He just lived to see her smile. Their commitment to each other. Burned like a forest fire. Otis on the radio singing ""Stand By Me"". As a trooper pulled them over. And said Jimmy where you been. Someone matching your description. Has just robbed the liquor store. Amanda said ""He's been with me"". But they weren't listening anymore. Down at Precinct Number Five. They questioned Jimmy through the night. The sheriff said ""He's gotta stand trial"". Armed robbery is the charge. Amanda said ""This cannot be"". Gonna stay right here until you set him free. And I love him. Here to eternity. Forever. Unto eternity. Oh God gave me something. I must hold on to. Gonna hold on him. No matter what you do. The old courthouse was crowded. As the judge reviewed the case. In a year of re-election. He was desperate to impress. Innocent or guilty. He saw an opportunity. To send Jimmy down for life. To the Penitentiary. Disbelief and anger. As they dragged him away. In a cell below the courthouse. They beat him like a slave. But his use of martial arts. Struck a blow for liberty. Felled a guard with a fist of iron. And killed him instantly. All the press surrounded Amanda. Coming down the courthouse steps. Pleading for her young man's life. And in a moment seen by millions. She bowed her head and cried. Show my man some mercy. He's the father of my child. I love him. Here to eternity. Forever. Unto eternity. Oh God gave me something. I must hold on to. Gonna hold on him. No matter what you do. I love him. Here to eternity. Jimmy Doyle appeared again. In a second public trail. For the murder of a prison guard. They sentenced him to die. But Amanda with her long red hair. Made one last plea. As the court fell into silence. She cried out desperately. This man of mine is innocent. As one day I shall prove. It's an open case of self defense. All this circumstantial evidence. You place before your court. Has robbed me of my husband. Forget I will not. I love him. Here to eternity. Forever. Unto eternity. Oh goodbye my Jimmy. 'Til we meet again. In a better world than this. I swear I'll clear your name. 'Cos I love you. Here to eternity."

i just got some,"(Maborn). [B side of Columbia DB 7892, 1966]. Well, I know y'all look as if you need some. But I just got some. I surely got some. The doctor prescribed some. I surely need some. Have to, have to have some, baby. Oh, I just went out and got some. My pockets ain't jinglin' and I'm gettin' fat. You know you can't hide it, I know where it's at. My pockets are as heavy as a chunk of lead. I just got a taste of her meat and veg. I had to have some. Sure did need some. Doctor prescribed some. Had to, had to, had to have some baby. Y'all know I look as if I need some. Oh, I just went out and got some, oh. Yeah. You would not help me when you really could. But right now baby, you can't do me no good. Cause I just got some.

i only have eyes for you,"Are the stars out tonight?. I don't know if it's cloudy or bright. Cause I only have eyes for you dear. The moon may be high. But I can't see a thing in the sky. Cause I only have eyes for you. I don't know if we're in a garden. Or on a crowded avenue. You are here, so am I. Maybe millions of people go by. But they all disappear from view. And I only have eyes for you. I don't know if we're in a garden. Or on a crowded avenue. You are here, so am I. Maybe millions of people go by. But they all disappear from view. And I only have eyes. Yes I only have eyes for you. For you."
i was only joking,"Ever since I was a kid at school. I messed around with all the rules. Apologised then realised. I'm not different after all. Me and the boys thought we had it sussed. Valentinos all of us. My dad said we looked ridiculous. But boy we broke some hearts. In and out of jobs, running free. Waging war with society. Dumb blank faces stare back at me. But nothing ever changed. Promises made in the heat of the night. Creeping home before it got too light. I wasted all that precious time. and blamed it on the wine. (Chorus:). I was only joking my dear. Looking for a way to hide my fear. What kind of fool was I. I could never win. Never found a compromise. Collected lovers like butterflies. Illusions of that grand first prize. are slowly wearing thin. Susy baby you were good to me. Giving love unselfishly. But you took it all too seriously. I guess it had to end. (Chorus). Now you ask me if I'm sincere. That's the question that I always fear. Verse seven is never clear. But I'll tell you what you want to hear. I try to give you all you want. But giving love is not my strongest point. If that's the case it's pointless going on. I'd rather be alone. 'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong. Pouring my heart out in a song. Owning up for prosperity. For the whole damn world to see. Quietly now while I turn a page. Act one is over without costume change. The principal would like to leave the stage. The crowd don't understand"
i wish it would rain,"(Norman Whitfield, Barret Strong, R. Penzabene). How you doin' Annaheim ? I don't know what else to call ya'. If I knew all your names, I'd call ya' your bloody names.. Here's one that we did when we was here - were many of you here last night ?. Alright, well I changed me shirt anyway - no I haven't - changed me trousers.. Sunshine, blue skies, please go away,. My love has found another, gone away. Withered up my future, my life is filled with gloom,. Day after day I stay locked up in my room.. I know to you it might sound strange. But I wish it would rain.. Curse so badly, I donæŠ° want to go outside,. Everyone knows that a man ainæŠ° supposed to cry.. Listen, IæŠ³e got to cry, 'cause crying sheds the pain.. To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain. I wish it would rain. Let it rain. Looking down at my tear stained face pressed against the window pane,. But I search the sky desperately for rain,. 'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops, no one will ever know. When IæŠ¦ crying, crying when I go outside.. To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain. I wish it would rain. Let it rain. Like that number ?."
i wish you love,"Goodbye, no use leading with our chins. This is where our story ends. Never lovers ever friends... Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day. But before you walk away. I sincerely want to say..... I wish you blue birds in the spring. To give your heart a song to sing. And then a kiss, and more than this. I wish you love.. And in July a lemonade. To cool you in some leafy glade. I wish you health and more than wealth. I wish you love.. My breaking heart and I agree. That you and I could never be. So with my best, my very best, I set you free.. I wish you shelter from the storm. A cozy fire to keep you warm. And most of all when snowflakes fall. I wish you love.. . (by Mr. Beck)"
i wouldn't ever change a thing,"(Rod Stewart). I wouldn't change a thing if I could live it all again. Ah listen. It's funny you know when you sit down. and think about what you had. About the friends you used to know. What happened, where did they all go. Can you remember happy hours. spent drinkin' and thinkin'. We thought we could change the world. And we never, never, never, never, never. never thought we could get much older then. We were the ones who loved to love the right to love. We'd bring it on home with the right song. played at the right time. What happened to the girl that you loved once and left. young man did you break her heart. Did she live, and did she marry,. did she ever think on your face again. Ah now hold on a minute. I wouldn't change a thing if I could live it all again. Ah yeah. I think what you say is all so right. but I find it hard to jog my memories. Don't worry Lou you may never get another chance yeah. Yes I think what you say is all so right. but I find it hard to move my memories. Say it again with a lot more feelin'. And I think what you say is all so right. but I find it hard to find my memories. Don't sing so serious you make me feel so sad. But if I was true to myself. I would probably find it was a tear in my eye. that stopped me from believing you. Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry don't worry. You know my tongue gets tired. when I think back on all of the things we do. But I wonder if I'll remember these few precious things. as years pass me by. Ah when young bodies that've grown older. and mind's become dimmer. I'll point the finger back in time. I said I wouldn't change a thing if I could. if I could, if I could live it all again, yeah."

I donâ€™t want to see you leave me baby. most of all I just donâ€™t, I just don't want to be free. I was just, I was just sitting here thinking. of your kiss and your warm embrace child.

I've grown accustomed to the tune. She whistles night and noon. Her smiles, her frowns, her ups and her downs. Are second nature to me now. (Second nature). Like breathing out and breathing in. (Breathing out and in). I was serenely independent and content before we met. Surely I could always be that way again and yet. I've grown accustomed to her looks. Accustomed to her voice, accustomed to her face. Grown accustomed to her looks. Grown accustomed to her voice. I've grown accustomed to her face. She almost makes the day begin. (Day begin). I've gotten used to hear her say. ""Good morning"", every day. Her joys, her woes, her highs, her lows. Are second nature to me now. (Second nature). Like breathing out and breathing in. (Breathing out and in). I'm so grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget. Rather like a habit one can always break and yet. I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air. Accustomed to her face. Grown accustomed to her looks. Grown accustomed to her trace. I've grown accustomed to her voice. Grown accustomed to her face. She's second nature to me now. Like breathing out and breathing in. (Breathing out and breathing in). I was serenely independent and content before we met. Surely I could always be that way again and yet. I've grown accustomed to her looks. Accustomed to her voice, I've accustomed to her face. Her looks. (I can't believe). Her trace. (How much I love her). Her voice. Her face. (I'm addicted to you, baby). Her looks. Her trace. (Because your love that drives me crazy). Her voice. Her face. Grown accustomed to her voice. (You know I finally realize). Grown accustomed to her face. (I got to hold it by my side). Grown accustomed to her looks. (I wanna be, be your ornament). Grown accustomed to her trace. ('Cause I love you, baby, please take my hand). Grown accustomed to her voice. (I'll be good to you each and everyday). Grown accustomed to her face. (I've grown accustomed). Grown accustomed to her looks. Grown accustomed to her trace. (Can't live if the livin' is without you). Grown accustomed to her voice. Grown accustomed to her face. (Can't give, can't live anymore)"
if i had you,"(Ooh, ooh, ooh). You by my side. You by my side. (Ooh, ooh). The other day I saw you walkin' (ooh). You looked as pretty as a peach. You seemed so near. And yet somehow you're out of my reach (out of my reach). If I had you I'd have the power (I'd have the power). To do most anything I choose (whatever you wanted). Oh, oh, oh, I would not care. Sometimes I'd win (you win, you win). Sometimes (sometimes) I'd lose, oh, wee. I could change the world [if I could change the world]. If I had you [by my side]. I could change the world [if I could change the world]. If I had you (by my side, yeah). My momma told me not to worry (I don't cheating). She said ""It'll all come to those who wait"". (Come to you and you won't be wait). But as I wait, I feel, oh, no. That it's much too late. That's why (never too late, baby). I could change the world [if I could change the world].

if i'm on the late side,"(Rod Stewart, Ronnie Lane, 1973). If I'm late, darling, don't hesitate. Just go without me and I'll see you there anyway. If I miss you at the station. I want you on that train. I don't want a sad sack. 'Cause I'll be there come what may. Leave a message with the porter. Or leave it at the gate. Just let me know that you're aboard her. Just a word to know that you're safe. I walk from Maryland to Silvertown. I hoped to catch you in the street. I must have missed you by a moment dear. I tried the place we alway meet. So if I'm late darling, don't hesitate, no no. Go on your ownsome and I'll catch you there anyway. I might lose sometime babe. But if I do I'll make amends in an hour. When I'm laying down beside you."
if not for you,"If not for you, babe, I couldn't find the door. Couldn't even see the floor. I'd be sad and blue if not for you.. If not for you, baby, I'd lay awake all night. Wait for the morning light. To shine in through. But it will not be new if not for you.. If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too. Without your love I'd be nowhere at all. I\'d be lost if not for you. And you know it\'s true.. If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too. Without your love I'd be nowhere at all. Oh what would I do if not for you ?. If not for you, winter would have no spring. I couldn't hear the robins sing. I just wouldn't have a clue. Anyway it wouldn't ring true if not for you. If not for you, if not for you."
if only,"(R. Stewart, K. Savigar, J. Cregan). If only I'd have listened to all of my closest friends. and knew that it was over and the party had to end. If only I'd have noticed the sadness in her eyes. she'd still be in my arms tonight, if only. If only I'd have realized the unimportance of being cool. to give a kiss and maybe just say ""Darlin' I love you"". If only I'd said I'm sorry I'd have been a much better man. she'd still be in my arms tonight, if only. There's an emptiness that fills my heart now that she's not here. I loved her more than my own life something I've always feared, if only. If only I'd come home at night instead of stayin' out for one more drink. If only I'd been unconcerned what the other guys may think. If only I'd a held her tight but I guess it's too late now. Oh how blind could one man be, if only. Whoa oh but I will not be sad after all the fun we've had. You live some and you learn some, if only. If only I could convince her the importance of one more chance. If only God would allow me one more celestial dance. If only I had the nerve to call her up and tell her how I feel. She'd still be in my arms tonight, if only. But it's only love and love ain't real it's only a four letter word. We spend half our lives chasing after it how wonderf 'lly absurd, if only. Whoa whoa but I will not be sad after all the fun we had. You live some and you learn some. Whoa but I will not be sad after all the fun that we had. You live some and you learn some, you learn some. If only."
if we fall in love tonight,"Faith flows like a river. Just keeps on flowing. In al the memories. Shame you're so heartbroken. Now you're scared to open. And give your love again. (Bridge). And now anticipation waits for love. Will it be everything you dreamed. This time around. I know you have your doubts. But I won't let you down. (Chorus). Darling if, if we fall in love tonight. You're gonna be alright. Your heart is in good hands. Darling if, if we fall in love again. On me you can depend. If you can take a chance. Open your heart and let love, love again. Rain whose fault is it this time. I can see it in your eyes. I know you're wondering. Faith can change. Say you'll be all mine. I'm gonna love you all the time. Won't let it slip away. (Bridge). (Chorus). Honey I don't want you to have any doubts about me. Whatever makes you happy I'm gonna do. Baby I'm so ready to love you now. I can't wait another moment. I need you right now. (chorus) 2x. Open your heart and let love, love again."
in a broken dream,"Every day I spend my time. Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine. Waitin' here to find the sign. That I can understand. Yes I am. In the days between the hours. Ivory towers, bloody flowers. Push their heads in to the air. I don't care if I ever know. There I go. Don't push your love too far. Your wounds won't leave a scar. Right now is where you are. In a broken dream. Did someone bow their head?. Did someone break the bread?. Good people are in bed. Before nine o'clock. On the pad before my eyes. Paper cries, tellin' lies. The promises you gave. From the grave of a broken heart. Hmm. Every day I spend my time. Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine. Waitin' here to find the sign. That I can understand. Yes I am. oh. I sit here in my lonely room. Don't push your love too far. You know your wounds won't even leave a scar. Right now is where you are. In a broken dream. And don't you forget what I say. Hoo, hoo"
in my life,"(J. Lennon, P. McCartney). There are places I remember. All my life, though some have changed. Some forever, not for better. Some are gone and some remain. Oh these places had their meanings. With lovers and friends, I still recall. Some are dead and some are living. In my life, I've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers. There is no one, compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning. When I think of love, as something new. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life, I've loved you more."
in my own crazy way,"(F. Miller, T. Seals, E. Setser, R. Stewart). The mystery of you and me. Is coloured blue on blue. We wanted more than we could give. We couldn't see it through. You won't believe these words from me. But still they're mine to say. I will always love you. In my own crazy way. I tried to keep my sanity. By being someone else. Someone that you could hold on to. I only fooled myself. I knew the part, but in my heart. The role I couldn't play. But I will always love you. In my own crazy way. I know I didn't do the little things. That could make a woman's heart sing. forgive me. And darling if I brought you any pain. I'm trying to explain. In my heart, I was always true. The memories of you and me. Are written on the wind. And sometimes, girl, I'd give the world. To do it all again. And if you need to call me. I won't be far away. I will always love you. In my own crazy way."
infatuation,"(R. Stewart / D. Hitchings / R. Robinson). Early in the morning I can't sleep. I can't work and I can't eat. I've been drunk all day, can't concentrate. Maybe I'm making a big mistake. Caught me down like a killer shark. It's like a railroad running right through my heart. Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave. Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge. Oh no not again. It hurts so good. I don't understand. Infatuation. Infatuation. Infatuation. Infatuation. Heart beats silly like a big bass drum. Losing all equilibrium. It's so hard in the middle of the week. Maybe this woman's just all I need. Oh no not again. It hurts so good. I don't understand. Infatuation. Infatuation. Infatuation. Infatuation. 'Fatuate me baby. Spirits soar when I'm by her side. She put a little love in this heart of mine. Maybe I'm lucky, maybe I'm freed. Maybe this woman's just all I need. Oh no not again. It hurts so good. I don't understand. Infatuation. Infatuation. Infatuation. Infatuation. Rev it up."
is that the thanks i get,(Rod Stewart / Jim Cregan). Did you think I'd take it sitting down. and let you walk all over me. Thought you knew me much better than that. I keep much better company. With your lawyers and your two timing friends. I guess you know who I mean. Your detectives and your private eyes. could never win me back again. Just where did it get ya. What satisfaction was had. You kicked the shit right in my face. Is that all the thanks I get. You said we made such a pretty pair. living in harmony. I'm sorry honey but I disagree. it seemed more like a comedy. Just look how you lied girl. that Judas right by your side. He hung you up so you cut me right down. Is that all the thanks I get. Guess I'll find me a brand new girl. That won't take too very long. There's so many floatin' 'round this town. waitin' by the telephone. And if you want me I'll be in the bar. back into my usual ways. Or on the corner with the rest of the boys. You and I were just a breath away. It was great while it lasted. but oh Lord it turned nasty. You didn't give me one chance to explain. Well is that all the thanks I get. Is that the thanks I get. Is that the thanks I get. Is that the thanks I get for loving you. Is that the thanks I get. Is that the thanks I get. Is that the thanks I get for loving you.
isn't it romantic?,"I've never met you, yet never doubt you. I can't forget you. I've thought you out, dear. I know your profile and I know the way you kiss. Just the thing I miss. On a night like this. If dreams are made of imagination. I'm not afraid of my own creation. With all my heart my heart is here for you to take. Why should I quake. I'm not awake. Isn't it romantic?. Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.. Isn't it romantic?. Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.. I hear the breezes playing in the trees above. While all the world is saying you were meant for love.. Isn't it romantic. Merely to be young on such a night as this?. Isn't it romantic?. Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.. Sweet symbols in the moonlight,. Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?. Isn't it romance?. [Instrumental]. I hear the breezes playing in the trees above. While all the world is saying you were meant for love.. Isn't it romantic. Merely to be young on such a night as this?. Isn't it romantic?. Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.. Sweet symbols in the moonlight,. Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?. Isn't it romance?. Isn't it romance?. Isn't it romance?"
it had to be you,"(feat. Michael Brecker). Why do I do, just as you say. Why must I just, give you your way. Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget. It must have been something lovers call fate. Kept me saying: ""I have to wait"". I saw them all, just couldn't fall 'til we met. It had to be you, it had to be you. I wandered around, and finally found the somebody who. Could make me be true, could make me be blue. And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you. Some others I've seen, might never be mean. Might never be cross, or try to be boss. But they wouldn't do. For nobody else gave me a thrill with all your faults. I love you still. It had to be you, wonderful you. It had to be you. Some others I've seen, might never be mean. Might never be cross, or try to be boss. But they wouldn't do. For nobody else, gave me a thrill with all your faults. I love you still. It had to be you. It had to be you. It had to be you, woah wonderful you. It had to be you"

it was a very good year,"When I was seventeen it was a very good year. It was a very good year for small town girls. and soft summer nights. We'd hide from the lights on the village green. When I was seventeen. When I was twenty-one it was a very good year. It was a very good year for city girls who lived up the stairs. With all that perfumed hair and it came undone. When I was twenty-one. Then I was thirty-five it was a very good year. It was a very good year. for blue-blooded girls of independent means. Who'd ride in limousines and their chauffeurs would drive. When I was thirty-five. When I was fifty-three it was a wonderful year. It was a wonderful year to find the girl I'd call my own. A place where I belong and she'd love only me. When I was fifty-three. But now the days grow short, I'm in the autumn of my years. And now I think of my life as vintage wine from fine old kegs. From the brim to the dregs, and it poured sweet and clear. It was a very good year"

it's over,"The congregation sang. We knelt and prayed. As we stood before God. On that beautiful day. The church bells rang. And the champagne flowed. As our friends gathered round. For the wedding photo. But here we are barely five years on. And our whole world's fallin' apart. All the plans we had together. Up in smoke and gone for ever. Poisoned by the lawyer's letter. It's over. I don't want our kids to suffer. Can we talk to one another. You were once my light, my lover. It's over. Rumours and whispers tear me apart. That I know you better than that. Inseparable were we. With a breeze in our sails. Now I feel a chill wind. On the marriage that failed. well our firends are all divided. They've taken their sides. Now they'll all sit back. And watch the circus unwind. I don't stand here tryin' to focus the blame. But I'm hurtin' deep down inside. All the pain and all the grievin'. When did we stop believin'. Too late now to stop the bleedin'. It's over. What's the sense in pointin' fingers. Who's the saint and who's the sinner. There ain't gonna be a winner. It's over. Oh, my dear, what happened to us?. Tell me, where did it all go wrong?. What's the use in keep on fightin'. All the tears, all the cryin'. Why do we keep denyin'. It's over. In all the time I thought I knew ya.

italian girls,"(Rod Stewart / Ron Wood). Iâ€™ve got two and more to show. I was dreaming of a mobile. that couldnâ€™t be mine not without lyinâ€™.

Well she claimed she was a killer. and she owned a flood lit villa. a little aways from the main highway. Oh take me way down yonder. She was tall, thin and tarty. and she drove a Maserati. faster than sound. I was heaven bound. Although I must have looked a creep. in my army surplus jeep. Was I being too bold. before the night could get old. No, no, no, no. She proved me so wrong. Oh the Italian girls sometimes hold their religious habits. in front of your eyes, just to get you tied. Ah but not my little Bella â€˜cause I did not have to tell her. Iâ€™d rather you go with the morning sun, she made me so tired. She took me way, way, away down yonder. till I was gone with the morning sun on my back. Gotta get on back there soon as I can. Take me there. And I miss the girl so bad. She broke my heart. Gotta get on back there soon as I can. I miss the girl, I miss the girl, I miss the girl so bad. I was a lot better off."

julia,"Here's a song I sing for you. About a girl that I once knew. Julia. She lived in a great big house. With golden gates where servants bowed. For Julia. Unashamed I'd sit outside and wait for hours. Hoping that she'd climb down from her ivory towers. This beautiful girl as pretty as any flower had a hold on me. Upstairs in my lonely room. I would dream of being cool. With Julia. I lived in obsessive bliss. Carefully planning my first kiss. Off Julia. One day I was feeling awfully brave and asked her. If she'd like to come on a date, I just had to. She bent down and gently kissed my face and said oh someday. Oh my god how I loved this girl. But no one ever said that love could burn. Waiting by the phone for days. For a call that never came. From Julia. But love is cruel and has no wings. But I still hear angels sing. For my Julia. I remember being overwhelmed by her prettiness. If only she would look my way I might be in business. To tell the truth she didn't even know I existed, Julia. Summer took her pretty clothes. Winter came in grey and snow. Oh Julia. And I found out she'd moved away. Her best friend said to the north country. Julia. Now all this happened many years ago my friend. Regrettably there is no happy end, oh no. She was 14, I was only 10, oh my Julia"
just another honky,"(Ronnie Lane). I close my eyes and ignore all the signs. I'm walking 'round in circles. I've closed my ears and believed my own lies. And break the silence always. I make a lot of words, big storm in the air. All 'round your hair it's blowing. Just leave it be and it will all blow away. The weather's always changing. You can go if you want to. I don't own you, go be wild. Leave my hand, it's wide open, so's the door evermore. It hurts me more to think Iâ€™ll keep you in chains. Than if you were to leave me.. I am what you are and Iâ€™m running too,. All for the open prairie.. So you can go if you want to. I don't own you, go be wild. Leave my hand it's wide open, so's the door forevermore.."
just like a woman,"(Bob Dylan). Nobody feels any pain,. tonight as I stand inside the rain..

Queen Mary, she's my friend,. oh I believe that I'll go see her again.. Nobody has to guess. that baby can't be blessed. till she finds out she's like all the rest,. with her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls.. She aches just like a woman, yes she does. she takes just like a woman, yes she does. she makes love just like a woman, yes she does. But she breaks just like a little girl.. It was raining from the first. and I was dying there of thirst,. So I came in here.. And your long time curse a' hurts,. but you know honey what's worse. is this pain in here,. I can't stay in here,. ain't it clear.. Oh I just don't fit,. I believe that it's time for us to quit.. When we meet again. and introduced as friends. please don't let on. that you knew me when. I was hungry and it was your world.. You fake just like a woman, yes she does. and make love just like a woman, yes she does. Then you ache just like a woman, yes she does.

lady day,North winds have made my face a little older. And my back is bent through trying too hard. My vest is torn so I make no perfect picture. To place upon your white-washed wall. I'd like to stay but you have not asked me. Still I don't really expect you to. Dusty boots would shame you now Lady Day. Are we really that far apart. I wis hthe world could see you now Lady Day. Laughing down at your oldest friend. The one who shared just about all he had. In a one-sided love affair. I get scared when I remember too much. Wasted time I suppose you could say that. Strange it don't seem that way to me. But wait a minute. I don't even think you're listening. Just let me tell you how I really feel. I've seen the inside of your heart Lady Day. When you want to be shown the way. I loved you then as I love ya now girl.
lady luck,Lady luck here I am on time. Propping up the bar with a glass of wine. Sunday night and I'm all spruced up and fine. But I ain't going nowhere. Lady Luck why don't you pull up a chair. And bring you shamrock wisdom darling over here. Your Gaelic humor and your pious smile. All the lads will be laughing tonight. Now you may say it's a funny old world. You may say that the game ain't fair. Is there a plot or do you improvise. Or maybe you don't even care. Lady luck in the nick of time. Why are some folks lucky while the rest are trying. Your demon plan is still a mystery. Laced with a touch of inconsistency. So why don't you give us all a break. Make us all rich healthy and fine. Five month holidays a 4-hour week. And a horse that wins all the time. Lady Luck hear the mandolins. Kinda makes you wonder how it might have been. Now I'll go back to the fun place I've got. Or back on the streets again. Lady Luck yeah it's late I know. Allow me to buy you one more for the road. Tell me something I've been longing to hear. It's gonna get better next year. 'Cause i've seen some rainy days. My patience is all ripped and torn. Now the sun comes shining through. I've cried in my beer too long. Lady Luck it sure is a funny old world. Sure is a funny old world.

last summer,"Sipping a sangria with a girl named Julia. Hot Jamaican sand beneath our feet. She purred like a cat in a Panama hat. She said my passport picture was unique. I said I did impersonations would you like to see. Turned around to buy her one more round. Then suddenly she disappeared. like I feared with another guy. Love always seems to let me down. Can be found anywhere around. The carnival had passed. and my heart was beating fast. All these married women, it ain't fair. Nervously I said would you like to come to bed. A cold silence pierced the evening air. Instantly she recognized my insecurities. Changing subjects quickly I agreed. Then suddenly she disappeared. like I feared with another guy, oo baby. Love always seems to let me down. Can be found anywhere around. Nowhere around. The tourist had all gone, winter's coming on. The hotel chambermaid didn't seem to care. Sharing a pina colada we broke into laughter. I'll never know how we made it up the stairs. We spent the night together. and she woke up in my arms. Kissed me tenderly and said goodbye. Then suddenly she disappeared. like I feared with another guy, oo baby. Love always seems to let me down. Can be found anywhere around. Nowhere around. Love always seems to let me down. Maybe I'll wait until next year, next year, next year"
last train home,"I'm cold and lonely. And I wanna be home in my bed. The rain is fallin'. And is trickling down the back of my neck. My pride is damned. I've been taken for a fool. I don't understand. All she has to do is call... just call. Last train, last train home. I'm waiting for the last train. The last train to take me home. I said I need her on the corner of Collins and Grand. And I've been standing here an hour. With the stupid flowers in my hand. How could you leave me standing by the side of the road. 'Cause I am all dressed up and I got no place to go. Nowhere to go. The last train, the last train home. The last train, the last train home. Last train, last train, last train, last train. Last train, last train, last train, last train. The night is empty. There's a mist coming in real fast. So I'll act not around. And whistle up the two from the past. I'd better stop walking. The roads are starting to freeze. Somewhere in this city. There's gotta be a girl for me. Just me. The last train home. The last train home is gone. The last train. The last train is gone. The last train. The last train is gone. Last train. Last train is gone. Excuse me Mr. Stewart. there's actually a train leaving in. About twenty minutes or we actually. have a later train than that, if you wanna go home"
leave virginia alone,"Well I chased her down the alley. And over the hill to steal her will. She was as hot as Georgia asphalt. When the ""A"" crowd came to adore her brain. (Chorus). So leave Virginia alone. Leave Virginia alone. She's not like you and me. She's not like you and me. You should've seen her back in the city. Poetry and jewels, broke all the rules. She was as high as a Georgia pine tree. Makeup and pills, overdue bills. (Chorus). Some sunny day when the hands of time. Have had their way. You'll understand why it was so hard to run away. She's a loser she's a forgiver. But she still finds good where no one could. You ought to want her more than money. Cadillacs and rust diamonds and dust. (chorus) 2x."

But she ain't fooled, her mother taught her well. It's not submission, it's just the look in her eyes. There's no decision, it's just the look in her eyes. She's not pretending, it's just the look in her eyes. She's not suggesting, it's just the look in her eyes"

lost in you,"Hey baby. You've been on my mind tonight. I felt lonely I just had to sit down and write. I spent all yesterday. Trying to figure out what I'm gonna say. One letter from the heart. Is so hard to start, baby. How's your momma how's the weather. How's that son of mine, yeah. Hey baby. Been a long time since we made love. I'm stone cold, the bed's hard, and the work is tough.

love has no pride,I've had bad dreams. Too many times. To think that they. Don't mean much anymore. The fine times have gone. And left my sad home. And the friends who once cared. Just walk out my door. Love has no pride. When I call out your name. Love has no pride. When there's no one left to blame. And I would give anything. To see you again. I've been alone. Too many nights. To think that you. Could come back again. But I've heard you talk. He's crazy to stay. But this love hurts me so. I don't care what they say. Love has no pride. When I call out your name. Love has no pride. When there's no one left to blame. And I would give anything. To see you again. And if I could buy your love I'd truly try my friend. And if I could pray by prayers would never never end. But if you want me to beg I'll fall down on my knees. Asking for you to come back I'd be pleading for you to come back. Begging for you to come back to me once again. Love has no pride. When I call out your name. Love has no pride. When there's no one left to blame. And I would give anything. To see you again. And I would do anything. To see you again. And I would give anything. To see you again

love is,"[Verse 1]. And so you come to me with your questions. On a subject on which I'm well-versed. Though I'm still as dumbfounded as the first time I found her. It's either a blessing or a curse. Although I cannot offer solutions. It would be reckless of me to try. Cause it's mystified man ever since time began. But hold on to your hat and I'll try. [Chorus]. Love is like a burning arrow. It can pierce the coldest heart. Love is warm, love is patient. And the craziest thing you'll ever start. All right. [Verse 2]. I recall when I was a young man. A day I'm never allowed to forget. There was a girl that I met who I dreamed I would wed. Forever I lodged in it, so hot. She said ""you gotta stop worrying about the future"". ""You know we're far too young for that"". ""I wanna spread my wings like a willow in the spring"". I never saw her pretty face again. [Chorus]. Love is life, love is yearning. It does not boast, but speaks the truth. Love is fair and knows no boundaries. And the craziest thing you'll ever do. Oh, yeah. [Verse 3]. I wish you well in all of your travels. And may you find what you're searching for. It'll hit you like thunder when you find one another. And stay in your heart forevermore. [Chorus]. Love is like a four-leaf clover. Hard to find and hold onto. Love is blind, love is tender. And the craziest thing you'll ever do. So crazy"
love lives here,(Ron Wood/Rod Stewart/Ronnie Lane). It's hard to believe that this is the place. Where we were so happy all our lives. Now so empty inside and feeling no pain. Waiting for a hammer and a big ball and chain. They can tear it all down and build something new. But only I remember what was here. Tomorrow comes easy just another day gone. How hong will I have to keep returning. Now I look back think I've known all the time. I've been finding myself for so long. All the vows that we made. Count for old bags of lumber. Disappear on the cart down the road.
love touch,"Oh, baby I don't know why. But sometimes I always seem to get. Tangled up in my pride. But, oh, baby we're not that blind. Deep down inside you know. This love's worth one more try. Don't push it all aside. (Chorus). 'Cause I wanna be good for you. I didn't mean to be bad. But darling I'm still the best. That you ever had. Just give me a chance. To let me show you how much. I wanna give you my love touch, love touch. Why can't I climb your walls. And find someplace to hide. Can't I knock down your door. And drag myself inside. I'll light your candles, baby. And maybe I'll light your life. I wanna feel the breathless end. You come to every night. This ever changing love. Is pushing me too far. I feel the need to reach you. Right now wherever you are. These empty arms are getting stronger. Every day, believe me, baby. They won't let you get away. No, they won't let you get away. (Chorus). (Chorus-2). You know it don't matter. Who's right or who's wrong. Think we're gonna find out. If this love is strong. Just give me a chance. To win back your trust. I wanna give you my love touch, love touch.

maggie may,"Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you. It's late September and I really should be back at school. I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used.

Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more. You led me away from home, just to save you from being alone. You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without. All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand. But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover. You wore me out. All you did was wreck my bed. And in the morning kick me in the head. Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore. You led me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone. You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried. I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school. Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool. Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand. Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face. You made a first-class fool out of me. But I'm as blind as a fool can be. You stole my heart but I love you anyway. (guitar bit again).

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes. He's so ambitious he even sews. But don't forget folks. That's what you get folks, for makin' whoopee. Another year, or maybe less. What's this I hear? Well you can guess. She feels neglected, and he's suspected. Of making whoopee. She sits alone, most every night. He doesn't phone; he doesn't write. He says he's busy, but she says ""Is he?"". He's making whoopee. He doesn't make much money; only 5000 per. Some judge who thinks he's funny. Says you'll pay 6 to her. He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?"". The judge says: ""Budge, right into jail"". You'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper. Than making whoopee"

And I love ya. Yes indeed and I love ya. And I love ya. Lordy I love ya."

That I would kick if I was given the chance. Never was amused by the kindness I used. I was whipped in the barn until dawn. It hurt me. Last summer we was restless. Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm. But it was all in the head. Cause out in the yard. Miss Judy had the National Guard. We was beaten, before we started. Miss Judy she was moody. And she always didn't get her own way. Just state the facts, get it right. Kick her when she's down."
missed you,"(Stewart). Hey Pal, let me lean on you and talk awhile. Your planes been delayed by the rain. or something. I wouldn't even fly away. If I had one good reason to stay. But you said. If you don't need my love. I'm gonna find someone who does. and I'm not hanging around. This old heart is far to proud. She got tired of me. staying out late everynight. I'd fall up the stair. Thought she'd always be there. But suddenly I'm alone. and I'm not accustomed to sleeping alone. She said if you don't need my love. I'm gonna find someone who does. You've stripped me of everything. and you've torn down all my dreams. Its been two long weeks. since shes been gone. Thought I had her in the palm of my hands. She said I'm through, don't try to call me. Cause you won't even find me. Cause if you don't need my love. I'm going to find someone who does. And the heartache you've give me. You'll get it back just wait and see. Well, well, well, well. I'd give anything to hold her in my bed again. I just wanna feel her breath on my back. She said my blood can't give her love. No way. She said if you don't need my love. I'm gonna find someone who does. And I'm gonna take our child. Cause I don't want him running wild. Hey pal, I think they just called out your flight. Put down your glass don't forget your boarding pass. And if your looking or you found love. or sunshine thats enough. Don't play hard to get. Cause that ain't where its at. Give her all your love. Place her high above. I missed you baby. I missed you baby. Yea I missed."
missing you,Every time I think of you. I always catch my breath. And I'm still standing here. And you're miles away. And I'm wondering why you left. And there's a storm that's raging. Through my frozen heart tonight. I hear your name in certain circles. And it always makes me smile. I spend my time. Thinking about you. And it's almost driving me wild. And there's a heart that's breaking. Down this long distance line tonight. I ain't missing you at all. Since you've been gone. Away. I ain't missing you. No matter. What I might say. There's a message. In the wild. And I'm sending you. this signal tonight. You don't know. How desperate I've become. And it looks like I'm losing this fight. In your world. I have no meaning. Though I'm trying hard. to understand. And it's my heart that's breaking. Down this long distance line tonight. I ain't missing you at all. Since you've been gone. Away. I ain't missing you. No matter. What my friends say. And there's a message that I'm sending out. Like a telegraph to your soul. And if I can't bridge this distance. Stop this heartbreak overload. I ain't missing you at all. Since you've been gone. Away. I ain't missing you. No matter. What my friends say. I ain't missing you. I ain't missing you. I keep lying to myself. And there's a storm that's raging. Through my frozen heart tonight. I ain't missing you at all. Since you've been gone. Away. I ain't missing you. No matter. What my friends say. Ain't missing you. I ain't missing you. I ain't missing you. I keep lying to myself. Ain't missing you. I ain't missing you. I ain't missing you. I ain't missing you. I ain't missing you. I ain't missing you. Ain't missing you. Oh no. No matter what my friends might say. I ain't missing you
moment of glory,"(R. Stewart, C. Kentis, J. Golub, C. Rojas). Here is a story that is bound to amuse ya. (about a fine young couple startin' out in life). A dedicated husband and a real fine worker. (who lived for his children and his beautiful wife). But one night in Dallas at a computer convention. (he got so loaded he could hardly stand). Woke up with a heavy head and a strange girl beside him. (returned home a worried guilty man). But inside his coat his wife found a note. It said ""Thanks for the good time Can I see you again"". She asked him ""Why oh why"" Tears rollin' down her eyes. ""would you give it all up for a moment of glory"" glory. Packed up all her bags and returned to her mother. (Two small children clinging to her dress). Hurt and disillusioned but never down hearted. (she picked up the pieces of her broken life). And meanwhile back in Boston the culprit lie thinkin'. (trying to find the answer in a bottle of wine). Fired from his job and missing his children. (he didn't care one way if he lived or died). Oh what a crying shame nobody else to blame. for one night of pleasure he had given her pain. Oh how it was so hard to climb so far to give it all up. for a moment of glory, glory. As the months rolled by and accusations fly. the bloodsuckin' lawyers know they're in for a kill. The gold war begins she's takin' off her rings. Close friends take sides while the waters are still. Phone rang twice in his stone cold appartment. (it was his little boy Johnny and his sister Beth). They said ""Daddy we miss you would you talk to Mommy"". (a line of communication he had sadly missed). She said ""Now don't get me wrong this is where you belong"". I said ""Good-bye children we can work it all out"". ""But don't you ever forget how this family has bled. 'cause you give it all up for a moment of glory"" glory. Won't you give it all up. you give it all up. Won't you give it all up. you give it all up."

move me,"(Stewart, Brock, Davis, Stocker, Savigar). It's obvious darlin'. you've become allergic to me. Are my trousers to wide. Do I drink and get mean. Is my demeanor that embarrassing. Are my jokes obsolete. Or is it my sweat that's no longer sweet. I work hard in the factory. to keep you in luxury. to which you've grown accustomed and you love. Lately you don't light my fuse. Is my fan belt coming loose. Punch me in the Bible baby please. Move me, move me, move me when I'm home. Why don't you move me, move me. move me when I'm home. Sometimes baby I awake in the night. I reach out to touch you. but I'm scared you might bite. A little emotion wouldn't be out of place. Wake up and love me put a smile on my face. Otis Redding said it best ""try a little tenderness"". Aretha wanted more ""Respect"". Give me just a little touch. that ain't really asking much. your dog gets more attention than I do. Move me, move me, move me when I'm home. Come on and move me, move me, move me when I'm home. Sometimes I wonder if you'll miss me at all. emotionally independent, as hard as a wall. You're so wrapped up in your own little world. your old time religion is your lunch with the girls. When I'm standing next to you even in a crowd. I might as well be on another planet. Tell me what I've done to you to justify this ridicule. if it's over why don't we forget it. Move me, soothe me, move me, rock me. move me when I'm home. Why don't you move me, love me, move me, rock me. move me when I'm home. Why don't you rock me, move me, love me, soothe me. move me when I'm home. Why don't you rock me, rock me, move me, soothe me. soothe me when I'm home."
"muddy, sam, and otis","Oh, yeah, I know, I know. I remember when I was only seventeen. The bohemian poet and disciple of the streets. Or was I just a little kid. Searching for identity. In '63. Heard it on the radio on a cold December night. It came burning down the air waves like a Savior's shining light. All the way from the U. S. A.. Across the Atlantic far away. The magic came. The house began to rock with Cupid and his bow. The Hootchie Cootchie Man's lonely harp began to blow. Little did I know that. Nothing in my life. Would ever be the same. Stayed up all night playing every forty-five. Trying to sound like you. Strummed my guitar in bed 'til my fingers bled. Trying to play like you. (Chorus). Thank you Sam, thank you Otis. Thank you Muddy. For the sounds you made. Thank you Sam, thank you Otis. Thank you Muddy. For the times we shared. And they carry on. I saw Otis back in 1965. Tears in my eyes as he sun ""These Arms Of Mine"". But the angels needed a soul man. For their celestial blues band. And took him home. Oh, what I'd give to see that red mohair suit. And hear ""Dock Of The Bay"". Or Sam in his two-tone singing ""Bring It On Back Home"". What a show that would be. (Chorus). If I sound sentimental. It's because this blue-eyed soul boy's. Got so much respect. My gratitude to you. Runs deep, proud and true. I will never forget. (Chorus-2) 2x. Thank you Sam, thank you Otis. Thank you Muddy. For the sounds you made. Thank you Sam, thank you Otis. Thank you Muddy. For the times you gave. Thank you Sam, thank you Sam. Thank you Otis,thank you Muddy. You'll never, never fade away."
my cherie amour,"La la la la la la. La la la la la la. My Cherie Amour, lovely as a summer's day. My Cherie Amour, distant as the Milky Way. My Cherie Amour, pretty little one that I adore. You're the only girl my heart beats for. How I wish that you were mine. In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street. I've been near you, but you never notice me. My Cherie Amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore. That behind that little smile I wore. How I wish that you were mine. Maybe someday you'll see my face among the crowd. Maybe someday I'll share your little distant cloud. Oh, Cherie Amour, pretty little one that I adore. You're the only girl my heart beats for. How I wish that you were mine. La la la la la la.

my fault,"(Ron Wood, Rod Stewart, Ian McLagan, 1973). Take me like you find me. Don't try to change me. You know better than that. Take me as you see me. Don't try to hide me. I ain't used to that. Shout it out loud. Put a bomb in a crowd. If I got something to say. There's nothing that can stop me. I can't let it lay. If I have to fall on my head. every night of the week. It's gonna be my fault,. no one else. If everything goes wrong. when I'm singing my song. It's gonna be my fault. and no one else. There ain't nothing you can do about it. I've sat and thought it over,. don't try to help me. I was just born this way,. yes I was born this way. I ain't gonna change for nobody,. never, never gonna change. So if everything goes wrong. and I drink all night. It's gonna be my fault. and no one else. People don't change just over night. It ain't natural, so don't. break it kindly,. don't hypnotize me. I just won't understand. Take me like you find me. Don't try to change me. You know better than that. oh don't you know better than that. oh don't you know better than that. Say I'm just a fool, that's alright. Never try to change me. or rearrange me, oh yeah."
my foollish heart,"The night is like a lovely tune. Beware my foolish heart. How white the ever constant moon. Take care my foolish heart. There's a line between love and fascination. That's hard to see on an evening such as this. For they both give the very same sensation. When your lost in the magic of a kiss. Her lips are much too close to mine. Beware my foolish heart. But should our eager lips combine. Then let the fire start. For this time it isn't fascination. Or a dream that will fade and fall apart. It's love, this time it's love. My foolish heart. For this time it isn't fascination. Or a dream that will fade and fall apart. It's love, this time it's love. My foolish heart"
my funny valentine,"Be hold the way our fine feathered-friend. his virtue doth parade.. Thou knowest not my dim witted friend,. the picture Thou hast made.. Thy vacant brow and Thy tousled hair. conceal Thy good intent.. Thou noble upright, truthful, sincere. And slightly dopey gent- you are... Refrain. My funny valentine. Sweet comic valentine. You make me smile with my heart. You looks are laughable, unphotographable. Yet you're my favorite work of art. Is your figure less than greek. Is your mouth a little bit weak. When you open it to speak, are you smart?. Don't change a hair for me. Not if you care for me. Stay little valentine stay. Each day is valentine's day"

She's heaven here on earth. Much more than I deserve. And I don't wanna ever let her go. I'm getting used to all her ways. Everything she says. Her smiles, her frowns. Her ups and all her downs. She's every move that I make. She's every breath I take. She's got a hold on me. That I don't wanna break. I mean my girl bring her home to me. My girl can't wait for you to see. My girl means everything to me. My girl my girl. My friends keep coming round. Saying come out on the town. What's wrong, you ain't the guy. We used to know. And I tell them I say. Without her by my side. I'm only half alive. I love her so bad. And I don't care if it shows. I mean my girl. Bring her home to me. My girl, means everything to me.

my heart stood still,Written by: Rodgers/Hart. I laughed at sweethearts. I met at schools. All indiscreet hearts. Seemed romantic fools. A house in Iceland. Was my heart's domain. I saw your eyes. Now castles rise in Spain!. I took one look at you. That's all I meant to do. And then my heart stood still. My feet could step and walk. My lips could move and talk. And yet my heart stood still. Though not a single word was spoken. I could tell you knew. That unfelt clasp of hands. Told me so well you knew. I never lived at all. Until the thrill of that moment when. My heart stood still. Though not a single word was spoken. I could tell you knew. That unfelt clasp of hands. Told me so well you knew. I never lived at all. Until the thrill of that moment when. My heart stood still. All that moment when. My heart stood still. My heart stood still. My heart stood still.
my way of giving,"(Steve Marriott, Ron Lane). I've been told it's just a matter of time. before you meet someone who opens your eyes. But time's on my side so nevertheless. I know the pain of too much happiness. Chorus:. It's all part of my way of giving. and I'm giving it all to you. More than love it's a way of living. and what more would you have me do. Although I'm not a guy that means to hurt. and if at times it seems our love won't work. I tell you honey, you must surely realize. See all confusion in my cloudy eyes. (Chorus). Although I'm not a guy that means to hurt. and if at times it seems our love won't work. I tell you honey you must surely realize. See all confusion in my cloudy eyes. (Chorus)."
never give up on a dream,"(Rod Stewart, Bernie Taupin / Jim Cregan). If there's doubt and you're cold,. don't you worry what the future holds.. We've gotta have heroes to teach us all. to never give up on a dream.. Claim the road, touch the sun,. no force on earth could stop you run.. When your heart bursts like the sun. never never give up on a dream.. Shadows fall, daylight dies,. freedom never got a place to hide..

night and day,"Night and day you are the one. Only you beneath the moon and under the sun. Whether near to me or far. It's no matter, darling, where you are. I think of you. Night and day. Day and night. Why is it so. That this longing for you follows wherever I go. In the roaring traffic's boom. In the silence of my lonely room. I think of you. Night and day. Night and day under the hide of me. There's an Oh, such a hungry yearning. Burning inside of me. And its torment won't be through. 'Till you spent my life making love to you. Day and night. Night and day. Night and day"
no holding back,"(R. Stewart, J. Creagan, K. Savigar). A friend of mine called up said ""I finally had some luck. Could I have a minute of your time. I met a girl last night and try as I might. I can't get her off of my mind. She walked through the room and right then I knew. I finally found somebody for me. But to tell you the truth I don't know what to do. should I go ahead or wait and see"". I said ""Give it all you got no holding back. Let a light in your soul. Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all. than to never love at all"". Now I'm the kind of guy who's normally quite shy. On romance I don't know a thing. But when she led me to the floor I'd never danced before. Suddenly my feet had wings. I know that she wants me I want her too. but I'm so confused I can't think straight. I feel so alive but on the other side. should I go ahead or should I wait. I said ""Give it all you got no holding back. Let a light in your soul. Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all. Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all. than to never love at all"". So when the music starts to flow from your hearts. like the coming of an early spring. when the river starts to flow between you soul to soul. may no man ever come between. Die in her arms if she wants you to. Be thankful for each passing day. When your eyes collide let your spirits fly. and pray to God it's here to stay. And I said ""Give it all you got no holding back. Let a light in your soul. Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all"". Give it all you got no holding back. Let a light in your soul. Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all. than to never love at all. than to never, never love at all. Ain't it better to lose in love than never love at all."
nobody knows,"(Ron Wood, Ronnie Lane). I'm waiting here in patience and I'm waiting all in vain. will I see you, will I touch you, will I hear you call my name ?. Comin' comin' comin' make. Ten steps to every one step that I take. Nobody comes and nobody goes, no one is happy, and no one has woes.. Everything lasting, ever the same,. nothing is ending, nothing can change.. The good Lord always has been, always will be ever the same.. And confusion mixed with illusion are years only turn again. With one and one hundred names,. had all the rooms, our key is to change.. Nobody comes and nobody goes, no one is happy and no one has woes,. everything lasting, nothing can change,. nothing is ending, ever the same. And nothing the same, it's never the same. Ooh hoo."
nobody knows you when you're down and out,"(Jimmie Cox). Once I lived the life. of a millionaire. Spending my money. Oh I didn't care. Taking my friends out. For a mighty good time. Oh we'd drink that good gin. Champagne and wine. But oh just as soon. As my money got low. I couldn't find nobody. And I had no place to go. And if I ever get my hands. On a dollar again. I'm gonna hold on. Till the eagle wins. Cause I found out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Lord have mercy. Yeah, yeah, now listen. Now in your pocket. There's not one penny. And all of them good friends. You found out you haven't got any. Nobody come around. But the landlord and the taxman. Your ex-wife who says. She wants more alimony. Then there's a knock on the door. And it's a woman you don't know. Says she's having your baby. She'll walk on in. But oh just as soon. as the money roll in. Here they all come sayings. That they're you're long lost friends. But if I ever get my hands. On a dollar again. I believe, I believe I'll hold on. Till the eagle wins. Cause I found out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Nobody wants you. When you're down and out. Nobody, nobody, nobody."
"oh god, i wish i was home tonight","(Rod Stewart / Chen, Savigar, Cregan, Grainger, 1980). The rain poured down the wind swept avenue. On another dark wet December afternoon. All my cherished memories are of you. All my warmth and comfort stayed with you. I would have wrote you a letter. but the telephone calls are free. Cause the boys in the next apartment. Are working all day. They're a great bunch of guys. But I think they're all gay. What am I doing. Avoiding what I'm trying to say. Oh God I wish I was home tonight. With you in my arms. Oh God I wish I was home tonight. Send me a naked picture. By the U.S. mail. Write a pornographic letter. You know I won't tell. Keep your legs closed tight. keep your body under lock and key. Stay home at night. And save all the best parts for me. Yeah baby. Oh God I wish I was home tonight. Yes I do baby. Oh God I wish I was home tonight, oh. I could be home in time for Christmas. If you want me to be. There's a plane leaves here at midnight. Arriving at three. But I'm a bit financially embarrased. I must admit. To tell you the truth my honey. I haven't a cent. Oh God I wish I was home tonight. Tonight baby. Oh God I wish I was home tonight. Guess I'd better ring off. Before the boys get home. My regards to all your family. And everyone at home. There's a lump comes in my throat. And a tear I can't hide. Cause I want to see you so badly. I just may die. And you know why baby. Oh God I wish I was home tonight. With the ones that I love. Oh God I wish I was home tonight. Oh God I wish I was home tonight. Oh my God I wish I was home tonight. Tonight, tonight. I've been hearing voices. Out on the street. They say you've found some one else. Who's really quite neat. But he doesn't move you like I do. Tell me what I wanna hear. That it just ain't true."
oh! no not my baby,"(Gerry Goffin, Carole King). [A side of Mercury 6052 371, 1973]. When my friends told me you had someone new,. I didn't believe a single word was true. I told them all I had faith in you.. I kept a-right on sayin'. Oh, no, not my baby,. oh no, not my sweet baby.. You're not like all those other girls. who play with the men's hearts like they were toys.. My mama told me, ""Son when rumors spread. that there is truth somewhere,. and you should use your head."". But sure didn't listen to what she said,. don't you know I kept a-right on sayin'. Oh, no, not my baby,. oh no, not my sweet baby..

on the beach,"(Wood, Lane). I don't care who is watching. Don't mind what the surfing heads might say. And though I may not be no Charlie Atlas. Gonna take my shirt off anyway. Now skin and bones sits easy on the high tide. And I'm not one for castles in the sand. I've seen a girl I once knew from the East Side. I think I spy a bottle in her hand.

It never did the scenery no harm. Never did the scenery no harm.."

only a boy,"(Rod Stewart/Kevin Savigar & Jim Cregan). Single file in the girls corridor. Come along, Stewart laddie!. Stewart boy, you'll never be much,. 'cause you're too busy acting the fool.. Thank you Sir for them few kind words,. on my last day of school.. Oh, but my mama said, I could be a success,. if I'd only get myself out of bed.. Words of wisdom, but I wasn't list'ning,. I had plans in my head.. Only a boy,. trying it on,. coming on strong,. restless to roam,. only a boy,. silly and proud,. reckless and loud,. impressing the crowd,. only a boy.. Rock'n' Roll was in my brain,. Eddie Cochrane running through my brain.. Skin tight trousers in council houses,. the unemployment exchange.. The blues I played were Mississippi made. and ev'ry Friday night I'd fall in love.. Football fields and teenage pills. nothing's enough.. Only a boy,. dressing to kill,. passion to spill,. hand in the till.. Only a boy,. slipping it in,. thin as a pin,. chasing a dream,. only a boy.. climb down off the school roof laddie. Oh and them dukes of freedom, I used to believe them,. and all their rebelious vows.. The critics, the cynics, who never understood it,. where are they now?. And all the wondering and the stumbling. that goes hand in hand with change.. The yearning, the earning was it all part of learning,. or am I still the same?. Only a boy. laughing aloud,. quick as a shot,. nobody can stop.. Only a boy,. plans of his own,. leaving his home,. knows where he's going,. only a boy.. only a boy,. only a boy,. only a boy, ha ha, oh."
only a hobo,"(Bob Dylan). As I was out walking on the corner one day. I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay. His face was all covered in the cold sidewalk floor. I guess he'd been there for a whole night or more. He was only a hobo, but one more is gone. Leaving nobody to carry it on. Leaving nobody to sing his sad song. Only a hobo, but one more is gone. A blanket of newspaper covered his head. The step was his pillow. The street was his bed. One look at his face. showed the hard road he'd come. and a fistful of money. showed the coins that he'd bummed. He was only a hobo, but one more is gone. Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song. Leavin' nobody to carry it on. Only a hobo, but one more is gone. Does it take much of a man. to see a whole life go down. To look on the world. from a hole in the ground. Too late for your future. like a horse that's gone lame. To lie in the gutter. and die with no name. He was only a hobo, but one more is gone. Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song. Leavin' nobody to carry it on. Only a hobo, but one more is gone."
ooh la la,"Poor old granddad. I laughed at all his words. I thought he was a bitter man. When he spoke of women's ways. They'll trap you then they use you. All before you even know. For love is blind and you're far too kind. Don't ever let it show. (Chorus). I wish that I knew what I know now. When I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know now. When I was stronger. The can-can's such a pretty show. It will steal your heart away. But the backstage back on earth again. The dressing rooms are gray. They come on strong and it ain't too long. 'Fore they make you feel a man. But love is blind and you soon will find. You're just a boy again. When you want her lips,you get her cheek. Makes you wonder where you are. If you want some more then she's fast asleep. Leaves you twinkling with the stars. Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say. You'll have to learn, just like me. And that's the hardest way. Ooh la la, ooh la la, lala, yeah.... (Chorus)."
our love is here to stay,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay. Not for a year but ever and a day. The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know. May just be passing fancies and in time may go. But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay. Together we're going a long, long way. In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble. They're only made of clay. But our love is here to stay. The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know. May just be passing fancies and in time may go. Oh, my dear, our love is here to stay. Together we're going a long, long way. In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble. They're only made of clay. Oh, but our love is here.

plynth (water down the drain),"(Hopkins, Wood, Stewart). I've woken up on mornings such as this. And thought exactly the same as I'm thinking now. Every night for a year I've slept alone. My cold damp room looks worse than me.. I got a fear of death that creeps on every night. I know I won't die soon but then again I might. Just like water down the drain I'm wasting away. And oh, doctors can't help. A ghost of a man, that's me.. I'm going far. Ah, ah, ah. And oh, water down the drain flows to the sea. The pattern of my life keeps a-hauntin' me. Like moisture from the ocean fills the sky. Comes on down to the ground as time goes by.. Ah, ah, ah. Please don't weep for me when I'm gone. Ah, ah, ah. I got a fear of death that creeps on every night. I know I won't die soon but then again I might. Please don't weep for me when I'm gone. Ah, ah, ah. A fear of death that creeps on every night."

rebel heart,"(R. Stewart, J. Golub, C. Kentis, C. Rojas). I picked her up about a quarter to nine. My brother told me I was wasting my time. A woman like that'll only cause you confusion. but go ahead you may find it amusing. She came to the door wearing a suit and tie. her hair cropped short I couldn't figure out why. Rebel heart don't be a loner. Rebel heart I'm your lover. Rebel heart I wanna discover. where you from and where you belong. and everything that turns you on. I wanted to dance but she flatly refused. I told her jokes but she was not amused. Tried to kiss her but she wouldn't stand still. Started thinking this was overkill.

I'll change your mind if you'll give me time. about everything that's on your mind. I stayed awake all last night fantasizing about you baby. You know I'd walk a million miles across broken glass. or a red hot Arabian desert. if I could just have one night in your long brass bed. Evening wound up on a very sad note. I drove her home and then she went for my throat. She said, ""it's fairly obvious I ain't attracted to you. You bore me to tears honest you do. And by the way I can't stand your British"". I said, ""don't start something, honey, you know you can't finish"". Rebel heart I won't forget ya. Rebel heart I'm glad I met ya. Rebel heart give me an answer. where you're from and where you belong. and everything that turns you on. You came, you saw, you conquered me. When you did that to me I knew that it had to be.

I'd go to church every Sunday. for just one night with you. Rebel heart I'm your lover. Rebel heart I wanna discover. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Rebel heart I won't forget ya. Rebel heart I'm glad I met ya. Rebel heart give me an answer. Oh yeah oh yeah. Rebel heart I won't forget ya. Rebel heart give me an answer. Oh yeah oh yeah."
red hot in black,"(R. Stewart, J.Cregan, K.Savigar). I met her in a little French cafe. Legs like a young giraffe. She was sitting reading Baudelaire. Not exactly working class. She had a studio in St. Michel. Crucifix around her waist. Che Guevara all over the wall. She can't stand the sun on her face. Hey boys, what a look. Stop a train at fifty feet. Matching hair, matching clothes and eyes. Kinda like a tiger in heat. Red hot in black. Red hot in black. Revolution running through her veins. A radical from head to toe. The only record that she ever played. Was ""just like a rolling stone"". We started talking by the candlelight. Her lips get closer to mine. We started dancing all around the room. Helped by a bottle of wine. Hey boys, mystery. Didn't even know her name. One night in Paris, with a girl like that. Never going home again. Red hot in black. Red hot in black. Oh my, when I woke up. She'd already gone out to her work. My head was aching and my back was scratched. I've never, never, never known a night like that. Took a walk along the avenue. So in love and so confused. My plane was leaving in half an hour. What would you have done in my shoes?. Hey boys, so you see. Couldn't get her outa my head. My regards to the folks back home. Gonna spend some time with red. Red hot in black. Red hot in black."
rest of my life,"I wanna feel like this for the rest of my life, my life. I wanna feel like this for the rest of my life, my life. Now I ain't been in love before. But I got sunshine at my door.

I wanna feel like this for the rest of my life, my life. I wanna feel like this for the rest of my life, my life. She's no beauty but neither am I. We got each other, we're flying high. I wanna feel like this for the rest of my life, my life. All of my buddies have settled down. Mamma said a good girl can't be found. Sit and watching telly on a Friday night. With Pizza and a Heineken Light. So I took one big leap of faith. Threw my hat in emptied my case. Sounds so silly but I believe. The birds in the trees are singing for me. I wanna feel like this for the rest of my life, my life. I wanna feel like this for the rest of my life, my life. I'm running around with my head in a cloud. I'm so far up, I ain't coming down.

rhythm of my heart,"Across the street, the river runs. Down in the gutter, life is slipping away. Let me still exist in another place. Running undercover of a helicopter blade. The flames are getting higher in effigy. Burning down the bridges of my memory. Love may still be alive somewhere, some day. Where they're downing only deer. A hundred steel towns away. Oh, the rhythm of my heart. Is beating like a drum. With the words ""I love you"". Rolling off my tongue. No, never will I roam. For I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky. I'll be sailing. Photographs and kerosene. Light up my darkness, light it up, light it up. I can still feel the touch. Of your thin blue jeans. Running down the alley. I've got my eyes all over you baby, oh baby. Oh, the rhythm of my heart. Is beating like a drum. With the words ""I love you"". Rolling off my tongue. No, never will I roam. For I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky. I'll be sailing (bis). (Bridge). Oh, I've got lightning in my veins. Shifting like the handle of a slot machine. Love may still exist in another place. I'm just yanking back the handle, no expression on my face. Oh, the rhythm of my heart. Is beating like a drum. With the words ""I love you"". Rolling off my tongue. Oh, never will I roam. For I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky. I'll be sailing. The rhythm of my heart. Is beating like a drum. With the words ""I love you"". Rolling off my tongue. Never will I roam. For I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky. I'll be sailing."

sailor,"(R. Stewart / R. Wood). You ain't gonna get me honey no way. Tearing down the highway in the pouring rain. escaping from my wedding day. I heard the bells ringing in the local church. the ceremony's nearly under way. Telegrams came and the cheap champagne. was driving everybody out of their brains. But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve. and I pleaded I was being framed. ""Sailor show me which way to go"". I screamed out loud. ""Sailor show me which way to go"". Such a deadly silence. due to my defiance. the wedding ground to a halt. Said I changed my mind. ain't no use in your trying. so her brother punched me in the throat. her mother got hysterical. the bitch was cynical. father's in the corner drunk. Picking myself off the floor. I ran to the door. damned if I was skippin' on my way. ""Sailor show me which way to go"". You should have heard the noise. Said ""Sailor show me which way to go"". So keep clean girlie. find a man that's truly. gonna love you from dusk till dawn. Keep your front door key. don't give him up for me. 'cause tomorrow I may be gone. You see, your wouldbe keepers. ( ) all night creepin'. nobody gonna change in there. Who thinks a marriage life should be like a dog's life. so let's renew it when the year runs out. Sailor show me which way to go. Sailor show me which way to go. She had a belly full of lust but she had no bust."
satisfied,"(Stewart, Taupin, Cregan, Savigar). It's a common misconception. about a man's role in this world. A provider and survivor and. a winner who must never fail. But oh how he needs a woman. to reassure and give him strength. through the darkest nights. and the hardest fights. when there's no other corner left. When the world outside is threatening. and all his dreams have been destroyed. take him in your arms watch all his guards. melt like a little boy. Tell him you really need him. Tell him you really care. Tell him you'll never leave him. He'll be satisfied. And he may not find it easy. to say what's on his mind. When he's full of doubt. say ""we'll work it out"". God knows how hard he's trying. And he may never buy you roses. and forget to notice your hair. but as long as he says ""I love you my dear"". that's all you need to hear. Tell him you really need him. Tell him you'll aways care. Tell him you'll never leave him. He'll be satisfied. And they say the heart's a hunter. but it's truth you can't deny. He may never be everything you want. but for you he'd lay down and die. So Friday night when the phone rings. and he's stuck in a downtown bar. roll away the stone. cause the last mile home. is the longest mile of them all. Tell him you really need him. Tell him you'll always care. Tell him you'll never leave him. He'll be satisfied. Tell him you really want him. Tell him you understand. and tell him that you love him. He'll be satisfied."
say it ain't true,"(Rod Stewart / Chen, Savigar, Cregan, Grainger). Look at all the problems. That we've been through. How can you tell me. That there's somebody new. I don't believe that I'm hearing this. I don't really think that you're serious. Well you picked a fine time to hesitate. See it my way I've nothing left. You can take my heart but don't steal my pride. Think it over before I'm pushed aside. And tell me. Say it ain't true. That's all you gotta do, baby. Say it ain't true. Well I thought this one was bound to last. Together forever oh what a laugh. It's going to hurt when I set you free. I've been loving you too long. You're a part of me. So tell me. Say it ain't true, Tell me baby. Say it ain't true. Put yourself in my place for a little while. Going out of fashion growing out of style. No one to laugh with nobody to share. No one to lean on nobody to care. Nothing left but a memory. I gave you my heart so stay with me. And tell me. Say it ain't true. Say it ain't true. Tell me baby. Say it ain't true. I love you baby. I love you baby. I just want to do right by you honey. Wouldn't do you no wrong."
scarred and scared,"(Rod Stewart / Gary Grainger). Started out like any one of you. Good intentions and a degree. But one hot night under the neon lights. Killed a boy just seventeen. Now I sit here rainin' on my Maker. Reprieve is all I'm praying for. Lord I fear the hangman's steps approachin'. Will the priest knock gently on my door. And I know I've let my daddy down. and I broke my mother's heart. I'd give anything turn back time again. Just give me one more start. I don't need no trial humiliation. Just tell me that I'm heaven bound. I don't want no two faced consolation. What use is that to me six feet underground. I'm going down to the engine shed. Put a gun up to my head. Blow myself into the promised land. We call it scarred and scared. And if you ever see my son again. Don't let on just how I fared. Tell him, tell him I went down big and strong. I was never, never, never scarred or scared. All the girls that once did gather 'round me. have moved along to someone else. Sitting here desperation is my close friend. What I'd give to kiss one of them now. Oo yeah I'll take you there. I'll take ya there."
secret heart,"Secret heart what are you made of?. What are you so afraid of?. Could it be three simple words. Or the fear of being overheard. What's wrong?. Let her in on your secret heart. Secret heart, why so mysterious?. Why so secret, why so serious?. Maybe you're just acting tough. Maybe you're just not bad enough. What's wrong?. Let her in on your secret heart. (Bridge) 2x. This very secret you're trying to conceal. Is the very same one you're dying to reveal. Go tell her how you feel. Secret heart come out and share it. This loneliness, few can bear it. Could it have something to do with. Admitting that you just can't. Go through it alone?. Let her in on your secret heart. Let her in on your secret heart."

And don't it seem like a long time. seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time. Hard times are only the other side of good times. but if you ever wished hard times were gone. you know what it's like to wish good times would come. And don't it seem like a long time. seem like a long time, seem like a long, long time. Help me, seems like a long time. seems like a long time, seems like a long, long time.

And don't it seem like a long time. seem like a long time, seems like a long, long time."
september in the rain,"The leaves of brown came tumbling down. Remember, in september in the rain. The sun went out just like a dying ember. In september in the rain.

sexual religion,If there's one thing that I don't understand. It's the power of a woman and the weakness of a man. When the lodge go down and the loving begins. You bring me to my knees. One night with you has messed up my head. The well rehearsed tease and the things that you said. The erotic suggestions and the next metaphors. Made me want you more. Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me. Over and over again. I'm addicted to your sexual religion. And I don't feel no shame. Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me. Over and over again. I'm a helpless disaster in the temple of love. A slave to the pleasure and pain. When you're out on the dancefloor. I'm checking your hips. And you let down your hair and your pop those lips. You're a heartbreaker honey and I can't let you go. You drive me out of my mind. And this drug that you're dealing is a powerful stuff. Your loving is working and sometimes not. You're a angel of Eden and an angel of love. And I just can't work you out. Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me. Over and over again. Hypnotized by your sexual religion. And I don't feel no shame. Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me. Over and over again. I'm a helpless disaster in the temple of love. A slave to the pleasure and pain. I'm real in deep this time. Can't sleep or eat but I'll be fine. Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me. Over and over again. I'm a helpless disaster in the temple of love. A slave to the pleasure and pain. Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me. Over and over again. Hypnotized by your sexual religion. And I don't feel no shame

some guys have all the luck,"Some guys have all the luck. Some guys have all the pain. Some guys get all the breaks. Some guys do nothing but complain.

It seem so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me. Some guys have all the luck. Some guys have all the pain. Some guys get all the breaks. Some guys do nothing but complain. Someone to take on a walk by the lake, Lord, let it be me. Someone who's shy, someone who'll cry at sad movies. I know I would die if I ever found out she was fooling me. You're just a dream and as real as it seems, I ain't that lucky. Some guys have all the luck. Some guys have all the pain. Some guys get all the breaks. Some guys do nothing but complain. All of my friends have a ring on their finger, they have someone. Someone to care for them, it ain't fair, I got no one. The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's help on the way. I called you collect, you didn't accept, you had nothing to say. Some guys have all the luck. Some guys have all the pain. Some guys get all the breaks. Some guys do nothing but complain. But if you were here with me. I'd feel so happy I could cry. You are so dear to me. I just can't let you say goodbye."
somebody special,"(Rod Stewart, Steve Harley / Chen, Savigar, Cregan, Grainger). How can you say life's getting you down. Get yourself out go along with the crowd. You're all dressed up got nowhere to go. You feel left out cause nobody showed. listen babe. When you think you're the only one. Who can't find love in this world. Tell yourself there's another one. Who's waiting for you, somewhere. Somebody special is thinking of you. Somebody special is dreaming of you. Somebody special is longing for you. Somebody special, special. Magazine dreams are easy stuff. But heaven knows they ain't good enough. Picture yourself from reel to reel. And get your hands on that driving wheel. And you know what. When it's hard to satisfy. A simple simple fantasy. Somebody somewhere is on your side. Waiting for you, crying. Somebody special, is looking for you. Somebody special, is searching for you. Somebody special, is waiting for you. Somebody special, somebody special. Maybe your heart's tormenting you. Why should it have any reason to. Wipe off that negativity. Put on some positivity. And when you think you're the only one. Who can't find love in this world. Tell yourself there's another one. Who's waiting for you, somewhere. Somebody special, is dreaming of you.

someone to watch over me,"(Gershwin). There's a somebody I'm longing to see. I hope that she turns out to be. Someone who'll watch over me. I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood. I know I could always be good. To one who'll watch over me. Although I may not be the man. Some girls think of as handsome. But to her heart. I carry the key. Won't you tell her please to put on some speed. Follow my lead, oh how I need. Someone to watch over me. I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood. I know I could always be good. To one who'll watch over me. Although I may not be the man. Some girls think of as handsome. But to her heart. I carry the key. And this world would be like heaven, if she'd. Follow my lead, oh how I need. Someone to watch over me. Someone to watch over me."
sometimes when we touch,You ask me if I love you. And I choke on my reply. I'd rather hurt you honestly. than mislead you with a lie. And who am I to judge you. On what you say or do. I'm only just beginning. To see the real you. (Chorus). And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much. And I have to close my eyes and hide. I wanna hold you 'til I die. 'Til we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you 'til the fear in me subsides. Romance and all its strategies. Leaves me battling with my pride. But for all the insecurity. Some tenderness survives. I'm just another writer. Still trapped within my truth. A hesitant prize-fighter. Still trapped within my youth. (Chorus). At times I'd like to break you. And drive you to your knees. At times I'd like to break through. And hold you endlessly. At times I understand you. And I know how hard you try. I've watched while love commands you. And I've watched love pass you by. At times I think we're drifters. Still searching for a friend. A brother or a sister. And then the passion flares again. (Chorus).

I'm down on my knees. Sonny won't you come back, come back,. come back to me please.. Someday, we'll hide the pain away, and. Sonny, I know that ... that we can laugh again.. I should have known and had more sense. sinking to a childish pride.. All I got was your looking glass. without your heart in side. 'cause she craves like you,. behaves like you,. and lays like you,. but she ain't you,. she plays like you,. prays like you,. does ev'rything like you,. but she ain't you.. She hides like you,. denies like you,. sighs like you,. but she ain't you.. Sonny,. Sonny,. Sonny won't you come back,. come back to me.. Sonny,. Sonny,. Sonny, oh. Oh."

I don't lose my way when you're here by me. (Chorus)
spanish boots,"(Beck, Stewart, Wood). I used to work and take a salary. In a hole up near a foundry. But it did not take me too long. To get my boots on a ""So Long!"". Long Spanish boots on a ""So Long!"". I took a day job in Bethlehem. I nearly threw in the towel then. But it did not take me too long. To get my boots on a ""So Long!"". High Spanish boots on a ""So Long!"". Dig it. I took a Spanish haberdashery. Restored with 15th century tapestry. But oh, Mr. Nesbitt got the best of me. So I strapped on my boots and said ""So Long!"". Laced up my high boots and ""So Long!"". Goodbye. ... am on a job you see. 'Cause my old boots they mean too much to me. Leather boots are just a mystery. Put on my boots and said ""So Long!"". High Spanish boots on and ""So Long!"". Put on my boots and said ""So Long!"". Those old Spanish boots. Put on my boots and said ""So Long!"". High spanish boots."
stand back,"(Stevie Nicks). No one looks as I walk by. Just an invitation would have been just fine. Said no to her again, again and again. First she took my heart then she ran. No one knows just how I feel. What I say unless you read between the lines. One girl walked away from me. First she took my head and then she. Take me home.. Stand back, stand back. In the middle of my room. I did not hear from you. It's all right, it's all right. You'll be standing in line. You'll be standing in line. I will cry. Do not turn away my friend. Like a river I can bend. No one calls out my name. And no one came. So I walked on down the line and waited for you. Maybe your protected from all that you do. One girl, did not call. She asked me for my love and that was all. Stand back, Stand back. In the middle of my room. I did not hear from you. It's alright, it's alright. You'll be standing in line. You'll be standing in line. I will cry. So I walked on down the line and waited for you. Maybe your attention was more than I could do. One girl, did not fall. She asked me for my love and that was all. Stand back, Stand back. In the middle of my room. I did not hear from you. It's alright, it's alright. You'll be standing in line. You'll be standing in line. I will cry. Gotta find a little sympathy ..... Try and ask me anything..... Gotta find a little sympaty..... Can I find a little sympathy......"
standin' in the shadows of love,"(Chorus). Standing in the shadows of love. I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come. Standing in the shadows of love. I'm just waiting for the heartaches to come. I want to run but there's no place to go. 'Cause heartaches will follow me I know. Without your love the love I need. It's the beginning of the end for me. 'Cause you've taken away all my reason for living. When you pushed aside all the love I been giving. (Bridge). Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't I. Didn't I do the best for you now didn't I. Don't you leave me. (Chorus). All alone I'm destined ot be. With misery my only company. Might come today might come tomorrow. But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow. Now don't your conscience kind of bother you. How can you watch me cry after all I done for you. Now hold on a minute. (Bridge). (Chorus). I want to fun but there's no place to go. 'Cause heartaches will follow me I know. Without your love the love that I need. It's the beginning of the end for me. Now don't your conscience kinda, kinda bother you. How can you watch me cry after all the things I done for you. Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't I. Didn't I do the best for you couldn't I. Didn't I do right by you didn't I. Didn't I screw you right now. Kept you in luxury didn't I. Didn't I do the best for you didn't I. Didn't I treat you right now didn't I. Ddin't I do the best for you now didn't I. I'm trying hard not to cry. You know my crying ain't gonna help me now. Without your love the love that I need. It's the beginning of the end for me. So don't you leave me. (Chorus)."
stardust,Stardust. . And now the purple dusk of twilight time. Steals across the meadows of my heart. High up in the sky the little stars climb. Always reminding me that we're apart. You wander down the lane and far away. Leaving me a song that will not die. Love is now the stardust of yesterday. The music of the years gone by. . Sometimes I wonder why I spend. The lonely night dreaming of a song. The melody haunts my reverie. And I am once again with you. When our love was new. And each kiss an inspiration. But that was long ago. Now my consolation. Is in the stardust of a song. Beside a garden wall. When stars are bright. You are in my arms. The nightingale tells his fairy tale. A paradise where roses bloom. Though I dream in vain. In my heart it will remain. My stardust melody. The memory of love's refrain

still love you,"(Rod Stewart). I was told by a good friend. you were untouchable, out of my reach.. But the first time ever I saw you,. I spilled my cherry lime over your dress.. You said, ""Don't you worry, it's not my best one."". First encounter, hardly the best.. But I would not change a thing. if I could do it all over again.. All I'm tryin' to say in my awkward way is,. ""I still love you."". Didn't I try to impress you,. but my old Chevy van kept breakin' down.. And my one room over the drugstore,. we watched the neon lights go out over town.. And some nights we'd go out dancin',. come home singin' by the Erie Canal.. two hearts gently poundin'. as that mornin' train came janglin' through.. But I would not change a thing. if I could do it all over again.. All I'm tryin' to say in my awkward way is,. ""I still love you."". Well darlin', didn't I promise. I'd never go so far away again?. But here I am writin' this letter;. goodbye to you, my love, see you again.. But I would not change a thing. if I could do it all over again.. All I'm tryin' to say in my awkward way is,. ""I still love you.""."
still the same,"Still The Same. [Originally by Bob Seger]. You always won, everytime you placed a bet. You\'re still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet. Everytime they were sure they had you caught. You were quicker than they thought. You'd just turn your back and walk. You always said, the cards would never do you wrong. The trick you said was never piay the game too long. A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take. The only loss you could forsake. The only bluff you couldn't fake. And you're still the same. I caught up with you yesterday. Moving game to game. No one standing in your way. Turning on the charm. Long enough to get you by. You're still the same. You still aim high. There you stood, everybody watched you play. I just turned and walked away. I had nothing left to say. 'Cause you're still the same. You're still the same. Moving game to game. Some things never change. You're still the same"
stone,"(Ronnie Lane). Well once I was a stone and many years ago. into a pool I was thrown, a many years ago.. Time passed by, the pool ran dry, escaped was I.. And tempered the beat came a fiery heat,. by the aim of a man, who's name was Dann, Dann the blacksmith.. Well once I was a sword, a many years ago.. And my blade was broad, a many years ago.. Worn my pride, in a battle I'd ride at a warrior side.. And I cut and I killed and was lost in the field,. and soon did rust, and corrode to dust, oh my.. Well and once I was a daisy, a many years ago.. In pastures green and lazy, a many years ago.. But I was hit by goat who fell in the moat, and forgetting to float. he sunk like a lead and stayed until dead,. but was relieved to find, oh Lord, just how kind it all was.. Well and once I was a grub, a many years ago.. And I lived in blood red mud, a many years ago.. But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune.. When the good work was done in the warmth of the sun.. I shed my skins, and dried my wings, and I flew away.. Well and once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival.. And once I was a carp and lived in waters on the mantle.. And once I was a man of earth, quoting verses from the Bible,. said I played them all, I played them all, St. Luke.. Well and once I was a mule, a many years ago.. But my master he treat me cruel, a many years ago.. By and by I was sick, couldn't move to his kick, so he took out a stick. and hit it right 'cross my back with an almighty crack,. and to his dismay, I passed away, into the blue.. Then I was born a human baby, a many years ago.. Well I remember I was born unto a lady, a many years ago.. All our hopes they were found on the back of a child that turned out to be wild.. Sent the devil a prayer and caused the pope to swear.. So I took my leave, to lie and plead, on my way to jail.. Well I've been a tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor.. I've known good times and disaster.. Oh but now I've found a teacher, and the teacher has a master,. and the master is perfection, so he helps us get there faster.. Oh it don't need no proof, because that's the truth, and I'll drink to that.."

superstar,Feels like I'm going insane. I'm losing my brain. I can't stand the pain I'm feleing. Open my arms they don't reach. I want you to teache me. What do I do now baby. Cry every day I exist. I want to be missed. I want to be needed baby. Don't want to put on a show. So where do I go. And what do I do now baby. Sometimes it seems to me. Like my whole world's falling apart. I miss you so much dear. Won't you come back to my arms. Thoughts spinning round in my head. About things that you said. I want to be sleeping baby. Open my eyes there's no one. The damage is done. Oh what can I do now baby.
sweet lady mary,"(Wood, Stewart, Lane). Sweet Lady Mary has to rest her poor head. Wakes in the morning with her breakfast in bed. I tried to help her, but I did not know how. I tried to love her, but it's all over now. Nothing left to comfort me, except a sunny day. Steal away, steal away. Over the stones along the dusty old road. With every footstep one more tale is told. With every turning one more side to see. Sweet Lady Mary's seen the last of me. A lesson is learnt, I'll never come this way again. I'll steal away, steal away. Her Spanish habits are so hard to forget. The lady lied with every breath, I accept. Was a matter of time before my face did not fit. I knew all along I'd have to quit.. Anyway now, I better not waste anymore of your time. I'll steal away, steal away. I think I'll go back home and start all again. Where the Gulf Stream waters tend to ease the pain. And on a new day when I've mended the wound. Sweet Lady Mary's gate I swear I'll be bound. But before I sit down again and waste anymore of your time. I better steal away, steal away. Ooh-hoo. Steal away-ay.."
sweet little rock 'n' roller,"(Chuck Berry). Nineteen years old and as sweet as she could be. All dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree. Dancin' and hummin' a rock 'n' roll melody. She's the daughter of a well respected man. who taught her how to jerk and understand. then she became a rock 'n' roll music fan. Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller. Her daddy doesn't have to scold her. Her partner can't hardly hold her. Because she never gets any older. Sweet little rock 'n' roller. Shoulda seen her eyes when the band began to play. and the famous singer sang and bowed away. When the stars were gone she screamed and yelled hurray. Ten thousand eyes were watchin' them leave the floor. Five thousand tongues are screaming out ""More"" and ""More"". About fifteen hundred waiting outside the door. Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller. Her daddy doesn't have to scold her. Her partner can't hardly hold her. Because she never gets any older. Sweet little rock 'n' roller."
sweet surrender,"(Stewart, Le Mesurier). You come to me with open arms. trying to rectify my charms. You say tonight I'm to be your lover. and by the morning light I'm to discover. everything that you've held inside of you. What's a man like me supposed to do. sweet oh sweet surrender. sweet, sweet surrender. You tell me that you're lonely and you're sad. and tonight I'm to be your only man. You wear those things that turn my head. You ruffle my ego but not my bed. Seems like summer when you're close at hand. If I seem eager then you'll understand. sweet, sweet surrender. sweet, sweet surrender. Heart is tired and full of doubt. now you've sucked me in don't spit me out. Lay your head down next to mine. and in each others arms we'll entwine. Look me straight in the eyes and tell me. between your heart and mind I see. sweet oh sweet surrender. sweet, sweet surrender. Surrender."
sweetheart like you,"Well the pressure's down the boss ain't here. He gone North he ain't around. They say that vanity got the best of him. But he sure left here after sundown. By the way that's a cute hat. And that smile so hard to resisit. But what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?. You know I once knew a woman who looked like you. She wanted a whole man not just a half. She used to call me sweet daddy when I was a child. In order to deal in this game, got to make the Queen disapear. It's done with a flick of the wrist. What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?. You know a woman like you should be at home. That's where you belong. Watching out for someone who loves you true. Who would never do you wrong. Just how much abuse will you be able to take. Well there's no way to tell by that first kiss. What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?. You know you can make a name for yourself. You can hear them tires squeal. You can be known as the most beautiful woman. Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal. You know, news of you has come down the line. Even before you came in the door. They say in your father's house there's many mansions. Each one of them got a fireproof floor. Snap out of it baby people are jealous of you. They smile in your face but behind your back they hiss. What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?. Got to be an important person to be in here, honey. Got to have done some evil deed. Got to have your own harem when you come in the door. Got to play your harp until your lips bleed. They say that patriotism is the last refuge. To which a scoundrel clings. Steal a little and they throw you in jail. Steal a lot and they make you King. There's only one step down from here, baby. It's called the land of permanent bliss. What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?."
'till there was you,"There were bells on a hill. But I never heard them ringing. No, I never heard them at all. Till there was you. There were birds in the sky. But I never saw them winging. No, I never saw them at all. Till there was you. Then there was music and wonderful roses. They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows. Of dawn and dew. There was love all around. But I never heard it singing. No I never heard it at all. Till there was you. Then there was music and wonderful roses. They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows. Of dawn and dew. There was love all around. But I never heard it singing. No, I never heard it at all. Till there was you. Till there was you."
taking a chance on love,Here I go again. I hear those trumpets blow again. All aglow again. Taking a chance on love. Here I slide again. About to take that ride again. I'm starry eyed again. Taking a chance on love. I thought the cards were a frame-up. I never would try. But now I'm taking the game up. And the ace of hearts is high. All things are mending now. I see a rainbow blending now. We'll have a happy ending now. Taking a chance on love. [Instrumental break]. Here I slip again. About to take that trip again. Got my grip again. Taking a chance on love. Now I prove again. That I can make life move again. In the groove again. Taking a chance on love. I walk around with a horseshoe. In clover I lie. And brother rabbit of course you. Better kiss your foot good-bye. On the ball again. I'm riding for a fall again. I'm gonna give my all again. Taking a chance on love. Taking a chance on love

tell everyone,(Ronnie Lane). May the smile on your face. Come straight from your heart. Takes a lady like you. To write that for me. To wake up with you. Makes my morning so bright. Wipes the sleep from my eyes. When you tell me your dreams. And it goes on and on. Way beyond and out of reach. It's a well known old secret. Go and tell everyone. Tell everyone. The smile on your face. Comes straight from your heart. If you look you will find. And you wrote that for me. Ooh-hoo-hoo.
ten days of rain,"(R. Stewart, K. Savigar, T. Brock). The wind cries on the boardwalk. Oh God, it's cold tonight. Somewhere in the city. Someone's holding her tight. He's telling her she's beautiful. Touching her long blond hair. He's found out all the secrets. We swore we'd never share. Oh, it drives me crazy. To think of her with him. Come back, baby. Come back home again. Chorus:. Ten days of rain. Ten days of rain. My heart is filled with pain. Will she ever come back again?. Ten days of rain. She said I'm tired of talking. Trying to get it through to you. You never tell me you love me. That's all I want you to do. I thought we had a future. Something to hold on to. We even talked of children. Something I never do. She loved me like no other. She held me like a child. Come back baby, come back home again. Chorus. The thought of her still haunts me. Her voice is everywhere. Ten days of rain. Ten days of rain. I can hear the freight train whistle. I can hear the church bells toll. But telephone line, when it's off the hook. That's the loneliest sound of 'em all. In the letter that she wrote me. Before she went away. She said darling, always remember. Love ain't a hard word to say. Ten days of rain. Ten days of rain, such pain. Will she ever come back again. I don't know, I don't know. Come back baby, I'm so lonely baby. Ten days of rain, ten days of rain. Is it raining all, raining all. Raining all over this world."
that old feeling,"(feat. Arturo Sandoval). I saw you last night and got that old feeling. When you came in sight I got that old feeling. The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill. And when you caught my eye. My heart stood still. Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning. And I knew the spark of love was still burning. There'll be no new romance for me. It's foolish to start. For that old, old feeling is still in my heart. Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning. And I knew the spark of love was still burning. There'll be no new romance for me. It's foolish to start. For that old, old feeling is still in my heart. Still in my heart. Still in my heart."

that's all you need,"(Ron Wood/Rod Stewart). Sit right down if you can spare me a minute. I got a tale thats bound to break your heart. Concerns my brother who's thin and played violin. Got it in his head that an IQ is all you need. He went his way I couldn't discover mine. I didn't worry if I ever saw him again. He's made a profit while I don't even own a pocket. And the last I heard he was sitting at the top of the tree. Wait a minute. Late last night reading my underground press. Came a knock on the door thought it was the third world war. Lord above I did not recognize him. I said have a cup of coke here maybe thats all you need. He said the smell of the city. Kid it's trying to kill me. My eyes are getting muddy. Christ I'm aging fast. My kind of music I knew it wasn't gonna to be simple. But have a quick listen kid maybe thats all you need. Don't stop you make me feel much better. Tell me my brother do you think that's all I need. yea yea. Don't it make you happy. Well, well, well, well, well. That's all you need. That's all you need. That's all you need. That's all you need.

the balltrap,"(Rod Stewart). Well my brother said he saw you in a downtown bar. With a price on your head and a black man on your arm. C'mon sister, I ain't quite as dumb as I seem. I'd rather see you dead with a rope 'round your neck. Or see you paralyzed in both your thighs. C'mon honey you got me crawling down on my knees. If you say it's all over I'll pack up and go. But this time tomorrow you'll be screamin' on the phone. Come back baby and let's get naked tonight. Well I can't say yes and I can't say no. My heart wants to love you but my soul says go. C'mon sugar why don't you let your man off the hook. You got me in a balltrap. Lord I'm eating outta your hands. You got me in a balltrap, hung up on a one-night stand. You got me in a balltrap, strung out on a midnight tram. First time I had you up on ol' Park Lane. You didn't know my name even when I came. As I recall you let me walk home in the rain. You said I'm cute but tell the truth. It's my body you want with the red hot juice. C'mon honey let's call the whole thing off. You got me in a balltrap. Lord, I'm eating outta your hands. You got me in a balltrap, hung up on a one-night stand. You got me in a balltrap, strung out on a midnight tram. My mama don't like you and I ain't surprised. You got poison lips, you got amphetamine eyes. She keeps on saying why don't you find a nice country girl. But Ma I ain't never been in love before. I can't sleep or eat all week. But Friday night I'll be alright. On the midnight trampoline. It's a balltrap. Lord, I'm eating outta your hands. You got me in a balltrap, hung up on a one-night stand. You got me in a balltrap, strung out on a midnight tram."
the best days of my life,"(Rod Stewart / Jim Cregan). You always said living with me was impossible. Try it I said just like the wind I'm changeable. We ain't got money but we sure got laughs. lots of loving too. So I confess on my behalf. you're giving me honestly. the best days of my life. Your whispering girls said don't be a fool. don't give into him. He's an animal treat you like dirt. then he'll turn you in. You two are not compatible. It'll never never last. They said I wasn't even suitable. But you're giving me honestly. the best days of my life. Sometimes I wonder. why does she bother with me at all. So staid in my ways. Let's face it my dear, I'm insufferable. The crazy nights spilling into days. with all my noisy friends. But they all love you as much as I. Giving me constantly. the best days of my life. And a day without you at this point my dear. seems unthinkable. A night without you more often. than not is unbearable. But if it all can't work out. one can never never tell. In my heart there is no doubt. you gave to me unselfishly. the best days of my life. But if it all can't work out one can never never tell."
the best of my love,"Every night I'm lyin' in bed. Holdin' you close in my dreams. Thinkin' about all the things that we said. And comin' apart at the seams. We try to talk it over. But the words come out too rough. I know you were tryin'. to give me the best of your love. Beautiful faces and loud, empty places. Look at the way that we live. Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine. Left us so little to give. That same old crowd. Was like a cold dark cloud. That we could never rise above. But here in my heart I give you the best of my love. Oh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love, oh. Sweet darlin', you get the best of my love. I'm goin' back in time. And it's a sweet dream. It was a quiet night. And I would be all right. If i could go on sleepin'. But every mornin'. I wake up and worry. What's gonna happen today. You see it your way. And I see it mine. But we both see it slippin' away. You know we always had each other baby. I guess that wasn't enough. Oh, but here in my heart. I give you the best of my love. Oh, sweet darlin'. You get the best of my love. Oh, sweet darlin'. You get the best of my love. Every night and day,. You get the best of my love. Oh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love. Oh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love.."
the day will come,"(Barry Mason). [A side of Columbia DB 7766, 1965]. The day will come when out of empty space. A flash of fire will light the children's face. Hopelessly, their last tears they will cry. Be too late to ask our leaders why. The day will come, a day of sorrow. A day we'll see them strollin' out to tomorrow.. The song of life that once we knew so well. Will not be heard as we're led into hell. Death is close, yes I can see the sign. And down your street the blood will flow like wine. The day will come, a day of sorrow. A day we'll see them strollin' out tomorrow. The day will come and swallow up the sun. We can't escape, we've got nowhere to run. The generals must be found some work to do. The medals must be bought by me and you, yeah. The day will come of pain and sorrow. And we'll see them strollin' out tomorrow. The day will come. The day will come. The day will come."
the downtown lights,"(Paul Buchanan). Sometimes I walk away. When all I really wanna do. Is love and hold you right. There is just one thing I can say. Nobody loves you this way. It's all right, can't you see. The downtown lights. In love we're all the same. We're walking down an empty street. And with nobody callin' your name. Empty streets, empty nights. The downtown lights. *How do I know you feel it. How do I know you feel it. How do I know you feel it. How do I know it's true. Can't you see. Nobody loves you this way. It's all right. Tonight and every night. Let's go walking down the city streets. Let's walk in the cool evening light. Wrong or right, the endless sight. The downtown lights. It will be all right. It will be all right. The downtown lights. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (*Repeat). Yeah, yeah, yeah. Downtown lights. The neons and the cigarettes. The rented rooms and rented cars. The crowded streets, the empty bars. Chimneytops, trumpets. The golden lights, the loving prayers. Colored shoes, the empty trains. I'm tired of cryin' on the stairs. Downtown lights. It'll be all right. It'll be all right"
the drinking song,"Like everybody else, I like a night on the town. I love a bellavino when the sun goes down. But unfortunately, one thing has led to another (yes it has). I've struggled more than once to put the key in the door. Fallen flat on my face on the disco floor. But if I die, I'm gonna die laughing. (Now listen). I've sung and I've danced in the streets of Paris. Discovered my trousers up an old oak tree. I've walked half naked through the hotel continental. (But you know what). I'm glad I did what I did when I did it. Make no mistake about that. And i'm glad I said what I said when I said it, Oh yeah. It was the drink that made me do it. I know sometimes I blew it. It was the drink that made me do it. Every time, Every time. I've skipped a lot, found out, and I've lost my socks. Even spent the night in a telephone box. I'm a sucker when I hear ""one more for the road. "". I've woken up with women that I hardly knew. Wine is the cause of silly tattoos. I've raised hell, where hell didn't need no raising. But I'm glad I did what I did when I did it. Make no mistake about that. And I'm glad I said what I said, Oh yeah. It was the drink that made me do it. Sometimes I guess I blew it. It was the drink that made me do it. Every time. Oh yeah. Ahh yeah. So, the moral of the story. Stick to tea and cakes. If ya take to the drinking you're gonna make mistakes. I wouldn't change a thing, if I could do it again. (No I wouldn't). It was the drink that make me do it. Sometimes I knew I blew it. It was the drink that made me do it. Every time. Every time. Oh yeah. Blame the drink"

the groom's stil waiting at the altar,"Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement. Heard the last moan of a boxer. Seen the massacre of the innocent. Felt around for the light switch, became nauseated. She was walking down the hallway. While the walls deteriorated. East of the Jordan, hard as the rock of Gibraltar. I see the burning of the page. Curtain risin' on a new age. See the groom still waitin' at the altar. Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery. Mistake your shyness for aloofness. Your shyness for snobbery. Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me. About the madness of becomin'. What one was never meant to be. West of the Jordan, east of the rock of Gibraltar. I see the burning of the stage. Curtain risin' on a new age. See the groom still waitin' at the altar. Don't know what I can say about claudette. That wouldn't come back to haunt me. Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me. But I know god has mercy on them. Who are slandered and humiliated. I'd a-done anything for that woman. If she didn't make me feel so obligated. West of the Jordan, west of the rock of Gibraltar. I see the burning of the cage. Curtain risin' on a new stage. See the groom still waitin' at the altar. Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?. I see people who are supposed to know better. Standin' around like furniture. There's a wall between you and what you want. And you got to leap it. Tonight you got the power to take it. Tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it. West of the Jordan, east of the rock of Gibraltar. I see the burning of the stage. Curtain risin' on a new age. See the groom still waitin' at the altar. Cities on fire, phones out of order. They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border. What can I say about Claudette? ain't seen her since january. She could be respectably married. Or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires. West of the Jordan, west of the rock of Gibraltar. I see the burning of the stage. Curtain risin' on a new age. See the groom still waitin' at the altar"
the killing of georgie (part i and ii),"(Part I and II). (Rod Stewart). In these days of changing ways. so called liberated days. a story comes to mind of a friend of mine. Georgie boy was gay I guess. nothin' more or nothin' less. the kindest guy I ever knew. His mother's tears fell in vain. the afternoon George tried to explain. that he needed love like all the rest. Pa said there must be a mistake. how can my son not be straight. after all I've said and done for him. Leavin' home on a Greyhound bus. cast out by the ones he loves. A victim of these gay days it seems. Georgie went to New York town. where he quickly settled down. and soon became the toast of the great white way. Accepted by Manhattan's elite. in all the places that were chic. No party was complete without George. Along the boulevards he'd cruise. and all the old queens blew a fuse. Everybody loved Georgie boy. The last time I saw George alive. was in the summer of seventy-five. he said he was in love I said I'm pleased. George attended the opening night. of another Broadway hype. but split before the final curtain fell. Deciding to take a short cut home. arm in arm they meant no wrong. A gentle breeze blew down Fifth Avenue. Out of a darkened side street came. a New Jersey gang with just one aim. to roll some innocent passer-by. There ensued a fearful fight. screams rang out in the night. Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone. A leather kid, a switchblade knife. He did not intend to take his life. He just pushed his luck a little too far that night. The sight of blood dispersed the gang. A crowd gathered, the police came. An ambulance screamed to a halt on Fifty-third and Third. Georgie's life ended there. but I ask who really cares. George once said to me and I quote. He said ""Never wait or hesitate. Get in kid, before it's too late. You may never get another chance. 'Cos youth a mask but it don't last. live it long and live it fast"". Georgie was a friend of mine. Oh Georgie stay, don't go away. Georgie please stay you take our breath away. Oh Georgie stay, don't go away. Georgie please stay you take our breath away. Oh Georgie stay, don't go away. Georgie, Georgie please stay you take our breath away. Oh Georgie stay."
the motown song,"(Chorus). Bring over some of your old Motown records. We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go. On the roof and listen to the Miracles. Echo through the alley down below, oh yeah. Let's dance together just for the night. Let's don't worry about the future or nothing else. 'Cause like the music's saying you gotta take chances. Go ahead, just do it and trust yourself. (Bridge). There's a soul in the city. Watching over us tonight. There's a soul in the city. Saying everything's gonna be alright. (Chorus). They wish us luck but they think we're just dreaming. Let's probe them wrong, baby. 'Cause you know what luck is luck is believing you're lucky. That's all and showing just a little bit of faith. (Bridge). There's a soul in the city. Watching over us I swear. There's a soul in the city. There's a whole world waiting out there, ah yeah. I got plans for us playing like a skip on a record. Through my head all night long. But when we walk that darkened stariway and step out on the roof. I know what we're feeling can't be wrong, ah yeah."
the nearness of you,"It's not the pale moon that excites me. That thrills and delights me, oh no. It's just the nearness of you. It isn't your sweet conversation. That brings this sensation, oh no. It's just the nearness of you. When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me. All my wildest dreams come true. I need no soft lights to enchant me. But if you'll only grant me the right. To hold you ever so tight. And to feel in the night ooh the nearness of you. When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me. All my wildest dreams come true. I need no soft lights to enchant me. But if you'll only grant me the right. To hold you ever so tight. And to feel in the night the nearness of you."
the skye boat song,"Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,. Thunderclaps rend the air,. Baffled, our foes stand by the shore,. Follow they will not dare.. Chorus:. Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing,. Onward, the sailors cry.. Carry the lad that's born to be king. Over the sea to Skye.. Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,. Ocean's a royal bed.. Rock'd in the deep Flora will keep. Watch o'er your weary head.. Chorus:. Burned are our homes, exile and death,. Scattered the loyal man.. Yet ere the sword, cool in the sheath,. Charlie will come again.. Chorus:. Many's the lad fought on that day,. Well the claymor could wield,. When the night came, silently lay. Dead in Collodens field."

the tracks of my tears,"People say im the life of the party. Cause i tell a joke or two.. Although i might be laughing,. Deep inside, im blue.... So take a good look at my face,. Youll see my smile looks out of place.. Just look closer, its easy to trace. The tracks of my tears.... I need you, need you.... Since you left me,. If you see me with another girl,. Seeming like im having fun,. Although she may be cute,. Shes just a substitute.. Cause youre the permanent one.... So take a good look at my face,. Youll see my smile looks out of place.. Just look closer, its easy to trace. The tracks of my tears.... Im masquerading.... My hope is fading.... Oh yeah, since you put me down,. My smile is my make-up i wear. Since my break-up with you.... So take a good look at my face,. Youll see my smile looks out of place.. Just look closer, its easy to trace. The tracks of my tears..."
the very thought of you,The very thought of you. And I forget to do. The little ordinary things. That everyone ought to do. I'm living in a kind of daydream. I'm happy as a king and foolish. Though it may seem to me. That's everything. The mere idea of you. The longing here for you. You'll never know. How slow the moments go. Till I'm near to you. I see your face in every flower. Your eyes in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you my love. The mere idea of you. The longing here for you. You'll never know. How slow the moments go. Till I'm near to you. I see your face in every flower. Your eyes in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you my love. The very thought of you my love. The very thought of you my love
the way you look tonight,"Some day, when I'm awfully low. When the world is cold. I will feel a glow just thinking of you. And the way you look tonight. You're so lovely, with your smile so warm. And your cheek so soft. There is nothing for me but to love you. And the way you look tonight. With each word your tenderness grows. Tearing my fears apart. And that laugh that wrinkles your nose. Touches my foolish heart. Yes you're lovely, never ever change. Keep that breathless charm. Won't you please arrange it?. 'Cause I love you. Just the way you look tonight. With each word your tenderness grows. Tearing my fears apart. And that laugh that wrinkles your nose. Touches my foolish heart. Yes you're lovely, never ever change. Keep that breathless charm. Won't you please arrange it?. 'Cause I love you. Just the way you look tonight. Just the way you look tonight. Darling. Just the way you look tonight"
the wild horse,"(R. Stewart/A. Taylor). Born and raised. In a motel in New Orleans. I ran away. with a hobo and his gypsy friends. We rode a freight train up to Cleveland. Across the Utah plains. Proud men, troubadours torn and frayed. Sleeping under the stars. While gently strumming guitars. Played the songs of Woddy Guthrie. And the open road. I knew right then I could never go home. Cause the wild horse runs free forever. Oh yeah, a wild horse runs free forever. And ever and ever. I met a girl. From a family of position and wealth. What a hand. this rambler had been finally dealt. A beauty six years and ten. I felt the walls closing in. Like a swollen river. Bout to overflow. Like a losing gambler I kept on rolling. And a wild horse runs free forever. Yeah yeah yeah. A wild horse runs free forever. The wild horse runs free forever. Yeah yeah yeah. A wild horse runs free forever. Play the guitar. So understand I must go. But I'll drink you one last toast. Oh here's to the heart. and the hands of a man. That come with the dust. and are gone with the wind. May the wild horse run free forever. yeah the wild horse runs free forever. The wild horse runs free forever. Yeah the wild horse run free forever. Wild guitar, baby, come on, wild. I know, I know, I know, I know. Play it for me, come on.. Yeah, hit it. Yeah yeah. Let me hear it, yeah.. The wild horse run free ...."
the wild side of life,( W. Warren / A. Carter). You wouldn't read my letters if I wrote them. You ask me not to call you on the phone. But there's something I've been waiting for to tell you. So I wrote it in the words of this song. Chorus:. I didn't know God made honky tonk angels. I might have known you'd never make a wife. You gave up the only one that ever loved you. And went on back to the wild side of life. The glamour of the gay nightlife has lured you. to the places where the wine and liquor flow. Where you wait to be somebody else's baby. And forget the truest love you'll ever know. (chorus). The glamour of the gay nightlife has lured you. to the places where the wine and liquor flow. Where you wait to be somebody else's baby. And forget the truest love you'll ever know. (chorus).
these foolish things,"(feat. Dave Koz). A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces. An airline ticket to romantic places. And still my heart has wings. These foolish things remind me of you. A tinkling piano in the next apartment. Those stumblin' words that told you what my heart meant. A fairground's painted swings. These foolish things remind me of you. You came, you saw, you conquered me. When you did that to me. I knew somehow this had to be. The winds of March that make my heart a dancer. A telephone that rings but who's to answer?. Oh, how the ghost of you clings. These foolish things remind me of you. The scent of smouldering leaves the wail of steamers. Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers. Oh how the ghost of you clings. These foolish things. Remind me of you. How strange, how sweet, to find you still. These things are dear to me. They seem to bring you so near to me. The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations. Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations. Oh how the ghost of you clings. These foolish things. Remind me of you. Remind me of you. Remind me of you."
they can't take that away from me,"The way you wear your hat. The way you sip your tea. The memory of all that. No no they can't take that away from me. The way your smile just beams. The way you sing off key. The way you haunt my dreams. No no they can't take that away from me. We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love. Still I'll always, always keep the memory of. The way you hold your knife. The way we dance till three. The way you change my life. No no they can't take that away from me. No they can't take that away from me. Yeah yeah yeah. We may never never meet again, on this bumpy road to love. Still I'll always, always keep the memory of. The way you hold your knife.

this,"(Marc Jordan/John Capek). Down below on Baker Street. Lay your head back. On this field of dreams. And close your eyes. There's a few that find love. On Sundays down by the sea. And they wash clean like angels. High above the waves so free. I have no words to say to you. I have no dream to take you to. I have no ring for you to kiss. Baby, all I have is this. Pray for grace. Keep the faith. Walk on down the road. Wait for me, look for love. Are you fearless, reckless. Homeless and all alone. Can you make love, heal things. Make my heart go wild again. *I have no words to say to you. I have no dream to take you to. I have no ring for you to kiss. Baby, all I have is this. I have no way to hold you now. I have no time to show you how. I have no gold, nothing to risk. Baby, all I have is this. And she says. It doesn't matter anymore. There's a few that find love. On Sundays down by the sea. And they wash clean. Like angels' wings. High above the waves so free. (*Repeat). All I have is on my sleeve. All I want is your sweet love, baby. All I saw was open space. Walk down the road. Fearless, fearless. All I have is this."
this old heart of mine,"This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times. Each time you break away I feel you're gone to stay. Lonely nights that come memories that go.

three button hand me down,"(Rod Stewart, Ian McLagen). I don't need no one's opinion. on the matter concerning my dress.. I was raised in a clinic down in Oklahoma,. there were many things I did not possess.. Well I never complained, because my father said,. ""Son you get your chance before you're my age"".. Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit. (?) written all over his face. He said, ""Others may come and others may go,. but that suit will be around wherever you're goin'"". Three button hand me down. three button hand me down. Hold on a minute. Now I had my fair share of neat women,. but they came between me and my suit.. That was a filly from Boston, a barmaid from Houston,. not forgetting the one in Detroit.. They said, ""We like you boy and we think you're sweet,. But can't you lose your suit?"". I said, ""Nononono, you can't do that to me"". I remember what my father said:. He said, ""Others may come and others may go,. but that suit will be around wherever you're goin'"". Three button hand me down, ha ha,. three button hand me down. I've never been a tidy dresser. and the fold in my trousers it ain't straight.. Still I know a good cloth when I see one.. That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit.. Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor. and get myself a smooth outfit.. Then I remember what my father said to me.. I make it from the open road, you all know this. He said, ""Others may come and others may go,. but that suit will be around wherever you go"". Three button hand me down,. three button hand me down, ha ha."

In a jukebox job downin' blues. in her leopard-skin anklehigh boots. while I'm jackin' off. readin' Playboy on a hot afternoon.. I'm a three time loser.. Caught it up in Monterey,. shook it up in East Virginia,. now my friends say it's here to stay.. How dare you have a party. in a Chelsea basement. when the poor excited Jezebel said come outside.. She felt me up and kissed my face,. put her dirty hands down in my pants.. She took all of my money,. left me naked by the silvery moon.. I'm a three time loser.. Caught it up in Monterey,. shook it up in East Virginia,. now my friends say it's here to stay.. Roll away, roll away, all of you women;. I don't think I need you anymore.. There'll be no more doctor's bills,. there'll be no more swallowing pills.. And I've found a woman. that can witness that in blood out of me.. I'm a three time loser..

tom traubert's blues (waltzing matilda),"(Tom Waits). Wasted and wounded. And it ain't what the moon did. I got what I paid for now. See you tomorrow. Hey Frank can I borrow. A couple of bucks from you. To go waltzing Matilda waltzing Matilda. You'll go waltzing Matilda with me. I'm an innocent victim. of a blinded alley. And I'm tired of all these soldiers here. No-one speaks English. And everything's broken. And my strength is soaking away. To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda. You'll go a waltzing Malitda with me. Now the dogs they are barking. and the taxi cab's parking. A lot they can do for me. I begged you to stab me. You tore my shirt open. And I'm down on my knees tonight. Old bushmills I staggered. You buried the dagger. Your silhouette window light. To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda. You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me. Now I've lost my St. Christopher. Now that I kissed her. And the one-arm bandit knows. And the maverick Chinaman. with the cold-blooded sigh. And the girls down by the striptease shows go. Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda. You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me. No I don't want your sympathy. Fugitives say. that the streets aren't for dreaming now. Manslaughter dragnet. and the ghost that sells memories. Want a piece of the action anyhow. Go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda. You'll go waltzing Matilda with me. And you can ask any sailor. And the keys from the jailor. And the old men in wheelchairs know. That Matilda's the defendant. She killed about a hundred. And she follows wherever you may go. Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda. You'll go waltzing Matilda with me. And it's a battered old suitcase. in a hotel someplace. And a wound that would never heal. No prima donnas the perfume is on. and old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey. And goodnight to the street-sweepers,. The night watchmen flame-keepers. And goodnight Matilda too. Goodnight Matilda too.."
tomorrow is such a long time,"(Bob Dylan). If today was not an endless highway. If tonight was not a crooked trail. If tomorrow wasn't such a long time. then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all. Ah but only if my own true love is waitin'. Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin'. only if she were lying by me. would I rest in my bed once again. I can't see my reflection in the mirror. I can't speak the sounds that show no pain. I can't hear the echoes of my footsteps. and can't remember the sound of my own name. Ah but only if my own true love is waitin'. Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin'. only if she were lying by me. would I rest in my bed once again. There's beauty in the silver singin' river. There's beauty in the sunlight in the sky. But none of these, and nothing else. can steal the beauty. that I remember in my true love's eyes. Ah but only if my own true love is waitin'. Yes and if I could hear her heart a softly poundin'. only if she were lying by me. would I rest in my bed once again."

tonight's the night,Stay away from my window. Stay away from my back door too. Disconnect the telephone line. Relax baby and draw that blind. Kick off your shoes and sit right down. Loosen up the back of your pretty French gown. Let me pour you a good long drink. Ooh baby don't you hesitate 'cause. Tonight's the night. It's gonna be alright. 'Cause I love you girl. Ain't nobody gonna stop us now. C'mon angel my heart's on fire. Don't deny your man's desire. You'd be a fool to stop this time.. Spread your wings and let me come inside 'cause.. Tonight's the night. It's gonna be alright. 'Cause I love you girl. Ain't nobody gonna stop us now. Don't say a word my virgin child. Just let your inhibitions run wild.

too bad,"Too bad we was thrown downstairs. You never got a chance to sing. We were quite polite. With one invite. To keep us off the street. We mingled for a minute or two. With the high class clientele. And then somebody said who invited them. Them that crowd of refugees. What an insult to be shown the door. Before we could shake a leg. I was most intrigued by the colored queen. Bleeding on the kitchen door. Then I was ushered with my friends. By the butler who was twelve feet tall. Well let me please explain. That were not to blame. We just don't have the right accent. No, no. All we wanted to do was to socialize. Oh you know its a shame. I was always getting the pain. All we wanted to do was to socialize. Oh you know its a shame. How we always get the blame. Twenty girls, damp hotels. Is where I'm gonna stay. Cause now I see what it's all about. I didn't at the old school side. Don't worry we had more fun. Waiting for the all night bus. Too bad my regional tongue. Gave us away again"

trouble,"(Stewart / Omartian). Looking out on the city tonight and I'm wondering why. Trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I am lost in an ocean of mixed emotions now. Everything I held sacred now has gone. Here am I far from home. Learning how to be alone. Silly me I should of guessed. Never settle on second best. Time for me to reassess. Chorus:. Heading into trouble. I am always heading into trouble. Sideways, downways. Heading into trouble. Now I'm losing you. It's gonna be a lonely summer without you 'round. I'll even miss the way you sing off key. Down in the market the reggae bands won't sound the same. Old Joe says without you they just don't believe. Now I am no longer sure. Who's gonna open every door. The love I take and couldn't share. The warmth I had but didn't care. To give myself I never dared. (Chorus). Hope it all goes well in the future for you my dear. Hope you find where your heart truly belongs. I don't know about me and tomorrow. 'Cause you're gonna be a hard act to follow. I'll miss you baby every day even though you're far away. Here's to you in every way. (Chorus)."

way back home,"I was just a little boy without care. I remember looking up and seeing you there. I never wandered too far from your sight. Cause all the love I needed was there in your eyes. We grew up in a war zone city with a cast iron wind. Broken lives, darken streets, and twisted steel. But around our house the sky seems so blue. And on a wing and prayer we just muddled through. And we always kept the laughter. And the smile upon our face. In that good-old-fashion british way. With pride and faultless grace. I shall never forget those childhood days. For as long as I shall live. And I'll always find my way back. Always find my way back home. Tell me why in wars that made our family strong. As our defiant little island wheathered the storm. There's never seemed enough on my plate. You said: ""... be grateful, say grace, don't complain... "". How can I ever thank yu for the lessons that I've learnt. And the precious warmth and comfort. That I've felt at every turn. And the roses sacrifice their lives. For freedom and for peace. I will always find my way back. Always find my way back home. I'll give you stories, operation burning skies. And our nation with its back against the wall. Like a wide-eyed school boy I hang on with the record (?). Stories I was knee-high to recall. And we always kept the laughter. And the smile upon our face. In that good-old-fashion british way. With pride and faultless grace. I shall never forget those childhood days. For as long as I should live. And I'll always find my way back, always find my way. And we always kept the laughter. And the smile upon our face3. In that good-old-fashion british way.

when i was your man,"(R.Stewart/K. Savigar). I remember just like it was yesterday. A summer's night, a small cafe. We laughed so much, we almost cried. Then I heard you say. I think I'm falling in love with you. I said Yeah, I'm the same way too. I let you in. You danced inside this old heart of mine. I've realized baby. You and I could never be. But I just wanna thank you. for the memories. When I was your man. When I was your man. When I was your man. Everything in my world. seemed good and right. I remember each and every day with you. And every way I made love to you. The way you made each day special. God I miss you so. You made me dance, you made me sing. You showed me what happiness. loving could bring. The way we spent last summer together. Seems so far away. Excuse me baby. If I sound a little blue. The best times ever had. I spent with you. When I was your man. When I was your man. When I was your man. Everything in my world. seemed good and right. I'm trying hard to carry on. But the thought of you still lingers on. The robe you wore. still hangs behind my bedroom door. Your dress rehearsals. And schoolgirl pranks. Your saxophone lessions, your cowboy hats. The way we planned our lives together. seems so far away. When I was your man. When I was your man. When I was your man. Everything in this world. seemed good and right. When I was your man. When I was your man. When I was your man. Everything in this world. seemed good and right."
when we were the new boys,"With laughing eyes I do recall. Every face that crammed thish all. And in this room our hats wereh ung. And words were written, and songs were sung. And we held our glasses high. And we dared to reach for the sky. And we never would grow old. When we were the new boys. And on these streets we were like kings. We'd roll and tumble fight and sing. And in these smoky pubs the yarns were spun. And many a sweetheart was lost and won. And on these green fields we played for pride. No quarter given no compromise. We were lovers and we were sons. When we were the new boys. Behind this cellar door on cheap guitars. We played our blues to the early hours. No one listening but a few old friends. We never dreamed it could ever end. This was our moment this was our space. This was a jewel of a time to have graced. But they're all sweet memories now. When we were the new boys. All my life I've been running. Down the side of this hill. But way down deep in my heart. Don't want the water to ever be still. All these friends have long since gone. Blown and scattered like autumn leaves. Some are lawyers and some are thieves. Some are long behind the sun. But I'll never be afraid. From the cradle to the grave. I learned my lesson and I learned it well. When we were the new boys. When we were the new boys."
where or when,"It seems we stood and talked like this before. We looked at each other in the same way then. But I can't remember where or when. The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore. The smile you are smiling you were smiling then. But I can't remember where or when. Some things that happened for the first time. Seem to be happening again. And so it seems that we have met before. And laughed before, and loved before. But who knows where or when. Some things that happened for the first time. Seem to be happening again. And so it seems that we have met before. And laughed before, and loved before. But who knows where or when. Who knows where or when."
who designed the snowflake,"Who designed the snowflake. Who made the planet spin. Who came up with new born babies skin. Who created seasons. The cycle of rebirth. Who introduced the oceans to the earth. Well whoever made the snowflakes. Made shadows where doubts lurk. I suspect an artist is at work. I know when an artist is at work. Who designed the snowflake. Who made that crystal fall. Fragile yet resilient in a storm. Who designed the snowflake. I look for clues or hints. For traces of the craftsman's fingerprints. I don't know who made the snowflake. So intricate sublime. But I can spot an artist every time. Oh, I can spot an artist every time. Did the darkness and the stars witness. What happened long ago. Did the darkness and the stars witness. What happened long ago. Perhaps only they know. Who invented the rainbow. Who made the waterfall. Who came up with new born babies skin. Some will tell you nature's random. That beauty's just a quirk. I believe an artist is at work. Sshh, an artist is at work. I say, look a genius at work"
who's gonna take me home,"Well I arrived on time. My courduroy suit and me bottle of wine. There were women wall to wall. It's saturday night and I wanted them all. Everyone. Sidled up for a dance. I tried a new step and fell in the plants. I told a joke, about the pope. It wasn't as funny as I would've hoped. Nobody told me she was the daughter. Of the mayor. I was so embarrassed, I just wished the. Ground would swallow me up. Accidentally my elbow hit the record player. The rock 'n' roll stopped. And everybody just stared. (oh no). Who's gonna take me home. I'm tired and I wanna go to bed. Who's gonna take me home. This party's gone right to my head. I didn't worry, not me. Panic ain't in my vocabulary. Smashed beyond reproach. Suddenly I wanted to take off my clothes. All hell broke loose. I started to take off my trousers and shoes. And so I tried to look cool. I stepped back and fell in the pool. The hostess helped me out. And asked for my dismissal. I said I was sorry, but I've been. Under so much pressure. Just lately, baby. I felt as popular as a russian guided missile. The last thing I remember, I left with a girl. On a motor bike. That weighed three hundred pounds and. What's wrong with that. Who's gonna take me home. I'm tired and I wanna go to bed. Who's gonna take me home. This party's gone right to my head. To my head. I woke up on the floor. Still in my suit and she told me I snored. I never felt so cheap. I had a good laugh at the size of her feet. Holy moses, I don't like this single living. I think I'll find me a nice local girl and. Settle on down, now. With a home and a garden. And a nature quite forgiving. Then again maybe I'll just hang around. Who's gonna take me home. I'm tired and I wanna go to bed, right now. Who's gonna take me home. This party's gone right to my head. To my head. Now who's gonna take me home. Hey brian could you give me a lift 'cos I don't live. Too far from you, boy. Mary c'mon I've known you so long please give. Me a lift home, oh c'mon. Jim oh c'mon boys would you just. Give me a lift home. I don't live too far from here and I'm so tired"
why does it go on?,"[B side of Columbia Db 7766, 1965]. You know it ain't right to beat a man when he's down. Know it ain't right to eat when the hunger's around. It keeps on worryin' me, as all around I see. And still it goes on. Why does it go on ?. Why does it go on ?. You know it ain't right to take another man's life. You know it ain't right to take another man's wife. Keeps gettin' through to me, as everywhere I see. Why does it go on ?. Why does it go on ?. Why does it go on ?. They don't want love today. It's headin' all the way. They'll burn your book and pencil boy. Throw your mind away. A man don't steal, but has to work for his pay. (let me tell you one thing). A poker man deals from the top when he plays. But all good things we take. We don't build, we just break. Why does it go on ?. Why does it go on ?. Why does it go on ?. They don't want love today. It's headin' all the way. They'll burn your book and pencil boy. Throw your mind away. A man don't steal, but has to work for his pay. (let me tell you one thing). A poker man deals from the top when he plays. But all good things we take. We don't build, we just break. Why does it go on ?. Why does it go on ?. Why does it go on? Yeah"
wicked messenger,"(Bob Dylan). There was a wicked messenger, from Eli he did come,. with a mind that multiplied the smallest matter. When questioned who had sent for him he answered with a thumb.. For his tongue it could not speak but only flatter. He stayed behind the Assembly Hall, it was there that he made his bed.. And often times he could be seen returning. oh oh. Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand which read,. ""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning"".. Ooh hoo hoo. The leaves began to falling and the seas began to part,. and the people that confronted him were many. The leaves began to falling and the seas began to part,. and the people that confronted him were many. And he was told these last few words which opened up his heart,. ""If you cannot bring good news, then don't bring any"". Oh oh. If you cannot bring good news, then don't bring any. Oooh hoo hoo hoo. And opened up his heart. Oooh hoo hoo."
windy town,"(James Harris III, Terry Lewis). Driving down. From the Highland Line. We'd done some gigs. On the Clyde of the Tyne. They flew us in. From a Hamburg strip. The taste of Dusseldorf. Still on our lips. And on the bus. There's a friend of mine. We go way back. To the scene of the crime. Sit up front. And share a cigarette. And try to remember. What we tried to forget. He said, ""do you remember"". He said, ""do you recall"". I said, ""Yeah I remember. Oh I remember it all"". *Everytime the cold wind blows. Everytime I hear the sound. Late night trains. Shuntin' down by the river. I remember Windy Town. We've come so far. And we moved so fast. Makin' haste. See it all grow past. Round the world. And around again. Up and down. On that gravy train. ** Everytime the cold wind blows. Everytime I hear the sound. East coast crosswinds. On the cold wet stone. I remember Windy Town. I've seen it all before. The freezing corners. And the empty streets. The burning passion. And the cold wet feet. Three tricky miles home every night. Dodging from the shadows. Underneath the overlights. Nocard for kissin'. And nowhere to go. 'Cept inside each other. And I love you so. I held your face. As you shivered in the rain. Girl, I'll ALLWAYAS LOVE YOU. AND IÂ´LL love you again. Oh everytime, yeah everytime. (*Repeat). (** Repeat). There it goes, there it goes. Windy Town."
winter wonderland (feat. michael bublé),"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,. In the lane, snow is glistening. A beautiful sight,. We're happy tonight,. Walking in a winter wonderland.. Gone away is the bluebird,. Here to stay is a new bird. He sings a love song,. As we go along,. Walking in a winter wonderland.. In the meadow we can build a snowman,. Then pretend that he is Parson Brown. He'll say: Are you married?. We'll say: No man,. But you can do the job. When you're in town.. Later on, we'll conspire,. As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid,. The plans that we've made,. Walking in a winter wonderland.. In the meadow we can build a snowman,. And pretend that he's a circus clown. We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,. Until the other kids knock him down.. When it snows, ain't it thrilling,. Though your nose gets a chilling. We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,. Walking in a winter wonderland.. Walking in a winter wonderland,. Walking in a winter wonderland."
you are everything,"Today I saw somebody who looked just like you. She walked like you do I thought it was you. As she turned the corner I called out your name. I felt so ashamed but it wasn't you, wasn't you. You are everything and everything is you. You are everything and everything is you. Oh you are everything and everything is you. How can I forget when each face that I see. Brings back memories of being with you. I just can't go on livin' life as I do. Comparing each girl to you. Knowing they just won't do, they're not you. You are everything. Everything is you. You're everything to me girl. I miss you baby. Everything is you. You are everything. Every little thing. You're all I've got. Girl, you're everything to me. You are everything and everything is you. Everything to me"
"you can make me dance, sing or anything","(Rod Stewart, Ron Wood, Kenny Jones, Tetsu Yamauchi, Ian McLagan). Hey baby, I wanna say somethin' to ya', listen. Sometimes when I get out of my head. And I say all the wrong things. Sometimes I know I stay out late at night. And I get back fighting, hey babe. Somehow all my plans. Keep slippin' through my hands. And I end up crying, but listen. I can be a millionaire. Honey when you're standing there. You're so exciting. You can make me dance, you can make me sing,. You can make me do just any old thing, and I love it. Sometimes I wanna get up so early. And get away from here girl. Summer's gone, and before long. North winds blow, that bring the snow. I'll keep us warm girl. My schemes it seems, are merely dreams. Fading with each morning, hey babe. But this old heart of mine. Is far too proud not to keep on tryin'. You can make me dance, you can make me sing,. You can make me do just any old thing, yeah baby. Ah yeah. So little bird don't fly away. Want you here every day. Don't ever leave me. I'd rather lose both my eyes. Than never see your smiling face again girl. You can make me dance, you can make me sing,. You can make me do just any old thing. You can make me dance, you can make me sing,. You can make me do just any old thing. Hey babe. Keep on loving me babe, yeah. Keep on loving me babe. Just keep on loving me babe. Just keep on loving me babe. Just keep on loving, ooh babe. Just keep on loving me darling.

Just keep on loving me darling. Just keep on loving me darling."
you go to my head,You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain. And I find you spinning 'round in my brain. Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne. You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew. And I find the very mention of you. Like the kicker in a julep or two. The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea. Cast a spell over me. Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself. Can't you see that it never can be. You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise. Like a summer with a thousand Julys. You intoxicate my soul with your eyes. Though I'm certain that this heart of mine. Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance. You go to my head. The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea. Cast a spell over me. Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself. Can't you see that it never can be. You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise. Like a summer with a thousand Julys. You intoxicate my soul with your eyes. Though I'm certain that this heart of mine. Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance. You go to my head. You go to my head. You go to my head.
you got a nerve,"(R. Stewart / G. Grainger). Here you stand with tears in your eyes. crying into my arms. pleading with me to take you back. teasing me with your charms. But you got a nerve to come round here. after all you've said and done. I thought I had seen everything. obviously I was wrong. 'Cause where were you when the sun went down. Skies turned dark and gray. Where were you when the north winds blew. Honey tell me where were you. I heard you were living down in Brazil. with them high class friends of mine. I can't believe I was so naive. Did I never once cross your mind. You told them all I was down and out. My existence you even denied. Oh what pleasure it gives me now. to know that you're bleeding inside. You were my life, you were my breath. You were every move I ever made. But recently my opinion's changed. The joke's on you I'm afraid. 'Cause I have a woman so beautiful. For you I could no longer wait. Please go away you may spoil everything. Your love has turned up too late. Go away, go away. Please, please go away. I loved you once. I don't love you now. Please, please go away."
you keep me hangin' on,"(Holland / Dozier / Holland). Set me free why don't you baby. Get out of my life why don't you baby. You really don't want me. You just keep me hanging on. You really don't need me. You just keep me hanging on. Why do you keep coming around. playing with my heart. Why don't you get out of my life. and help me to make a new start. Let me get over you. the way you got over me. Set me free why don't you baby. Get out of my life why don't you baby. You really don't want me child. You just keep me hanging on. You never, never, never needed me. You just keep me hanging on. You said when we broke up. you just wanted to be friends. Tell me, how can we still be friends. when seeing you just breaks my heart again. and there ain't nothing I can do about it. You really don't need me. You just keep me hanging on. You really don't need me baby. You just keep me hanging on. Set me free why don't you baby. Set me free why don't you baby. Get out of my life why don't you honey. You just keep me hanging on."
you put something better inside me,"(Rafferty/Egan). I can look out my window. Or stare at the wall. It really didn't matter. Na, I just didn't care at all. Could be sitting by the water. Counting every stone. But nothing means nothing. When your empty and on your own. Cause you put something better. Inside of me. You put something better. Inside of me. Makes me so much stronger. I'm amazed at the change in me. Well I knew what I was doing. I was running away. Busy going nowhere. Just wasting the time of day. I was walking down the road. Kicking at the stones. Nothing means nothing. When your empty and on your own. Know why?. You put something better inside of me. Makes me so much stronger. I'm amazed at the change in me. You put something better inside of me. Makes me so much stronger. I'm amazed at the change in me. You made me so much stronger. I'm amazed at the change in me. Take me home."
you send me,"YOU SEND ME. Writtten by Sam Cooke. Duet with Caka Khan. Darling you send me. I know that you send me. Darling you send me. Honest you do. You thrill me. Darling you thrill me. Darling you thrill me. Honest you do. At first I thought it was infatuation. But oh, it’s lasted so long. Now I find myself wanting. Wanting to marry you and take you home. You send me. I know you send me. Darling you thrill me. Honest you do"
you shook me,"(Willie Dixon and J.B. Lenore). You know you shook me,. you shook me all night long, yes you did.. You know you shook me,. you shook me all night long.. And the way that you love me baby, (you know what you do?). You mess up my happy home.. (Dig this). You know you love me,. just like a hurricane.. You know you love me,. just like a hurricane.. And the way that you love me baby,. You mess up my happy home, (you're so bad).. Come on ...."
you wear it well,"I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon. But to settle down and write you a line. I've been meaning to phone you, but from Minnesota. Hell, it's been a very long time. You wear it well. A little old-fashioned, but that's alright. Well, I suppose you're thinking how Betty is sinking. Or he wouldn't get in touch with me. Though I ain't begging or losing my head. I sure do want you to know, that. You wear it well. there ain't a lady in the land so fine, oh my. Remember their basement parties, your brothers' cavorting. The all-day rock-and-roll show. The homesick blues and the radical views. Haven't left a mark on you. (Chorus). You wear it well. A little out of line but I don't mind. But, I ain't forgetting that you were once mine. But I'll believe it without even trying. Now I'm eating my heart out. Trying to get a letter through. Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on. I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town. And you sat down and cried on the stairs. You knew it didn't cost the earth but for what it's worth. You made me feel a millionaire. You wear it well. Madame Onassis got nothing on you; no, no. And when my coffee is cold and I'm getting told. That I gotta get back to work. So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone. Think of me and try not to laugh, and. (Chorus 2). I'll wear it well. I don't object if you call collect. 'Cause I ain't forgetting that you were once mine. But I feel it without even trying. Now I'm eating my heart out. Trying to get back to you"
you're in my heart (the final acclaim),"I didn't know what day it was. when you walked into the room. I said hello unnoticed. You said goodbye too soon. Breezing through the clientele. spinning yarns that were so lyrical. I really must confess right here. the attraction was purely physical. I took all those habits of yours. that in the beginning were hard to accept. Your fashion sense, Beardsly prints. I put down to experience. The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent. who tried to change my point of view. Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed. but my heart cried out for you. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul. My love for you is immeasurable. My respect for you immense. You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness. You're beauty and elegance. You're a rhapsody, a comedy. You're a symphony and a play. You're every love song ever written. But honey what do you see in me. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul. You're an essay in glamour. Please pardon the grammar. but you're every schoolboy's dream. You're Celtic, United,. but baby I've decided. You're the best team I've ever seen. And there have been many affairs. Many times I've thought to leave. But I bite my lip and turn around. 'cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul"
you're insane,"(R. Stewart / P.Chen). You must be crazy or half insane. Look at your eyeballs, street cocaine. You drink that white rum, you hit the roof. What do you expect, one-five-one proof. You drive your mustang down Sunset Strip. And in the back seat, a big black whip. Look at your lipstick, all 'round your face. Everything you do is in bad taste. Chorus:. Baby I think you're cute. But there's no substitute for love. Honey it's a crying shame. This whole mad town thinks you're insane. You take me dancing but I can't dance. but when I try to, you start to laugh. You shake your hips child like a rattle snake. You make me jealous make no mistake. You went to Woodstock and all that trash. Your generation is fading fast. You wear them hot pants, they're out of style. You like brown sugar, I think it's vile. (Chorus). One of these nights child, it won't be long. Somebody somewhere who's big and strong. In a dark alley, a blood stained coat. He'll stick his long thing right down your throat. (Chorus). Lord have mercy. Hey baby, I think you're insane baby. You got no brain, you're insane. Tell me baby, can you play harp. Can you play bass. Can you play guitar. Can you play drum. Then you're insane."
you're my girl (i don't want to discuss it),"See your bag's packed and you're ready to go. There's just one thing I think that you all ought to know. You're my girl, you're my girl. I don't wanna discuss it woman. Ain't no need to try. I don't wanna discuss it baby. come on baby try. You're my girl, listen baby, you're my girl. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna hear you say. I don't wanna even discuss it woman. I don't wanna hear what you say. Cause you know that. You're my girl, you're my girl. You're my girl, you're my girl, no no. I know that you've been running 'round. with another man in town. Tried to put you right woman. but you keep on putting me down. Listen to me now, you're my girl. You're my girl. You're my girl. get in there. I don't wanna talk about it woman. Cause I know you got another man. I don't wanna say another word. just get back where you're at. You got to tell me 'cause. You're my girl, come on baby. You're my girl, you're my girl oh-oh. You're my girl. You're my girl. You're my girl"
you're so rude,"(Ian McLagan, Ronnie Lane). My mom she likes you. She thinks your swell. Got the makings of a dance hall girl. Your lowcut frock and your birds nest hair. Stepping up heels and the way that you smell. She says to take you back. To see my folks again. On Sunday. Why it looks as though theres nobody in. They've all went out to see my Auntie Renny. Don't you worry you just come right in. I'm sure we'll pass the time til they come home. Well let me take your coat. Take off your shoes, warm your toes. Try the sofa. Its getting dark we'll miss the late night bus. It's only eight but I'm not taking any chances. Whats that noise why'd they come back so soon. Straighten your dress you're really looking a mess. I'll wet my sox pretend we just got caught in the rain. Oh your so rude."
you're the star,You gave me hope. When all around was lost. And I could see no point in trying. For I saw love passing me by. You came into my life. You came into my life. I look around. And what I had is gone. Now I've finally found. What I've been missing. The road I travel is so clear. Since you came into my life. You came into my life. (Chorus). And you're the star. The shining light. The morning dawn. And when the sun. Comes up so bright. And the closer I get. Yes it's true. You're the star. Above the storm. I want to wrap you in my arms. And keep you warm. No I don't want to live without you. No I've never found loving like you. You gave me faith. The kind I thought had gone. Somewhere down the line. I think I've lost it. Now I've felt the changes in my heart. Your faith in me is strong. Your faith in me is strong. (Chorus).
young turks,"(Rod Stewart / Carmine Appice, Kevin Savigar, Duane Hitchings). Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams.. He said somehow, some way, it's gotta get better than this.. Patti packed her bags, left a note for her momma, she was just seventeen,. there were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye.. They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so excited.. We got just one shot of life, let's take it while we're still not afraid.. Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided.. And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands.. Young hearts be free tonight. Time is on your side,. Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around,. don't let 'em ever change your point of view.. Paradise was closed so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner.. They took a tworoom apartment that was jumping ev'ry night of the week.. Happiness was found in each other's arms as expected, yeah. Billy pierced his ears, drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh!. Young hearts be free tonight.Time is on your side,. Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around,. don't let 'em ever change your point of view.. [instrumental verse]. Young hearts be free tonight. Time is on your side.. Billy wrote a letter back home to Patti's parents tryin' to explain.. He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way.. But there ain't no point in talking when there's nobody list'ning so we just ran away. Patti gave birth to a ten pound baby boy, yeah!. Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side.. Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side.. Young hearts be free tonight, time in on your side.. Young hearts gotta run free, be free, live free. Time is on, time is on your side. Time, time, time, time is on your side. is on your side. is on your side. is on your side. Young heart be free tonight. tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah"
your song,It's a little bit funny this feeling inside. I'm not one of those who can easily hide. I don't have much money but boy if I did. I'd buy a big house where we could both live. If I was a sculptor but then again no. Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show. I know it's not much but it's the best I can do. My gift is my song and this one's for you. And you can tell everybody that this is your song. It may be quite simple but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind. I hope you don't mind that I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're in the world. I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss. Well a few of the verses. well they've got me quite cross. But the sun's been quite kind. while I wrote this song. It's for people like you that keep it turned on. So excuse me forgetting but these things I do. You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue. Anyway the thing is what I really mean. Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen. And you can tell everybody that this is your song. It may be quite simple but now that it's done. I hope you don't mind. I hope you don't mind that I put down in words. How wonderful life is now you're in the world
