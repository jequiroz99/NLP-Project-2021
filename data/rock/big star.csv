Dear, dear friends (thank you again). Thank you friends (thank you again). And again, and again..... Never too late to start."
the ballad of el goodo,"Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh. But I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds. It gets so hard at times like now to hold on. My guns they're waiting to be stuck by. At my side is God. And there ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. There's people around who tell you that they know. The places where they send you, and it's easy to go. They'll zip you up and dress you down. Stand you in a row. But you know you don't have to. You can just say no. And there ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. I've been built up and trusted. Broke down and busted. But they'll get theirs and we'll get ours. Just if we can. Just, ah, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Years ago my heart was set to live, oh. But I've been trying hard against strong odds. It gets so hard at times like now to hold on. Well, I'll fall if I don't fight. And at my side is God. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Ain't no one gonna turn me 'round. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. [alternate lines of last verse:]. Years ago I was all set to go. And I've been trying hard against long odds. It gets so hard at times like this to even hang around. I can either stand or fall. And I believe I'm gonna stand tall."
the india song,I'd like to go to India. Live in a big white house in the forest. Drink gin and tonic and play a grand piano. Read a few books. Far from what saddens my heart. Try to live away from it. Find a new girl. Who says she feels the same. Get to know her after the trip. Bathe in a forest pool. Her life a part of mine. And let no one know until I'm gone.
the letter,"Give me a ticket for an airplane. Ain't got time to take no fast train. Lonely days are gone, I'm going home. My baby just wrote me a letter. I don't care how much money I got to spend. Got to get back to my baby again. Lonely days are gone, I'm going home. My baby just wrote me a letter. She wrote me a letter. Said she couldn't live without me no more. Listen Mister, can't you see. Got to get back to my baby once more. Anyway."
there was a light,There was a light. So dear to me. I wanted to live. There was a time. So near to me. I asked you to give your life to me. If it's a sign. Sent down to me. I'm asking you why. It had to be. Spending all my time. Waiting to die. What's the use. There was a light. So dear to me. I wanted to live. There was a time. So dear to me. I asked you to give your life to me.
thirteen,"Won't you let me walk you home from school. Won't you let me meet you at the pool. Maybe Friday I can. Get tickets for the dance. And I'll take you. Won't you tell your dad, ""Get off my back"". Tell him what we said about ""Paint It, Black"". Rock 'n Roll is here to stay. Come inside where it's okay. And I'll shake you.. Won't you tell me what you're thinking of.. Would you be an outlaw for my love. If it's so, well, let me know. If it's ""no,"" well, I can go.. I won't make you.."
though i know she lies,When I look though your eyes. I tend to get bitter. Maybe I'm best advised. To look to myself. I fall every time. Though I know she lies. I can't stay away. Stars would fall from the sky. And I won't forsake you. You've got lust in your heart. What's sad to me. I'll use every line. Anything to make you mine. Keeping me in the dark. Wondering where you are. Don't let me fall apart. You said take it slow. But I don't know. I don't know. Lying awake in the bed trying to. Cope with the feelings. I'm don't know if it's love. But what can I do. I fall every time. Though I know she lies. I can't stay away.
till the end of the day,"Baby I feel good. From the moment I arise. Feel good from morning. Till the end of the day. You and me, we live a life. From when we get up. Till we go through the night. You and me, we're free, yeah. We do as we please, yeah. From morning till the end of the day. Till the end of the day. Yeah, I get up, I see the sun. And I feel good, yeah. 'Cuz my life has begun. You and me, we're free, yeah. We do as we please, yeah. From morning till the end of the day. Till the end of the day. Till the end of the day. You and me, we're free, yeah. We do as we please, yeah. From morning till the end of the day. Till the end of the day. Till the end of the day. Till the end of the day. Till the end of the day."
try again,Lord I've been trying to be what I should. Lord I've been trying to do what I could. But each time it gets a little harder. I feel the pain. But I'll try again. Lord I've been trying to be understood. And Lord I've been trying to do as you would. But each time it gets a little harder. I feel the pain. But I'll try again.
watch the sunrise,"I can feel it, now it's time. Open your eyes. Fears be gone, it won't be long. There's a light in the sky. It's okay to look outside. The day it will abide. And watch the sunrise. Sun, it shines on all of us. We are one in it's hand. Come inside and light my room. like the heart of every man. It's okay to look outside. The day it will abide. And watch the sunrise. I can feel it, now it's time. Open your eyes. Fears be gone, it won't be long. There's a light in the sky. It's okay to look outside. Your love it will abide. And watch the sunrise."
way out west,She's a schemer and she makes me bad. but I love her a lot those lonely nights. I was in a big room playing my things. oh I wish she were here she can be so kind. when she's not trying to hide. she tries not to love me but she knows. she can. CHORUS And why don't you come on back from. way out west. and love me we can work out the rest. She thinks she's a mystery to all. but I know what's behind those eyes. sometimes I think she'll make me forget. what I need most to remember. and then I'll slip on back. even if they say it's better..
what's going ahn,I liked her face and oh those eyes. she left today oh goodbye. and looking at you I'm drained outright. and isolated in the light. CHORUS And I resigned everyone. ever since I was young. I'm starting to understand. What's going ahn and how it's planned. I like love but I don't know. all these girls they come and go. always nothing left to say..
when my baby's beside me,"Don't need to talk to my doctor. Don't need to talk to my shrink. Don't need to hide behind no locked doors. I don't need to think. 'Cause when my baby's beside me, I don't worry. When my baby's beside me, All I know. When my baby's beside me, I don't worry. When my baby's beside me, All I know. Read all my books and talked about. Listen to my radio. Been to school and dropped right out. Tryin' to find out what I didn't know. But when my baby's beside me, I don't worry. When my baby's beside me, All I know. When my baby's beside me, I don't worry. When my baby's beside me, All I know. Don't need to talk to my doctor. Don't need to talk to my shrink.

You can't have me, not for free.. Gymnast, working out on the parallel rails. Cuttin' trails, screams and wails. Face go pale, never fails. You do steal things. Unawares, but I don't care.

you get what you deserve,Try to understand what I'm going through. and don't blame for what folks will do. for some of us it's not a bood time. but you're going to get used to. and you'd better resign yourself.. CHORUS You get what you deserve. you ought to find out what it's worth. and you've gotta have a lotta nerve.. You just do what pleases you. and go on and sign out every move. you're going to get place in the scene. all God's orphans get face in the dream.. Too bad such a drag ow !. so much pain down the drain. and a lot of us ain't got many friends..
