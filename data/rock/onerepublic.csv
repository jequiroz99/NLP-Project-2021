nbhd (feat. santigold),[verse 1]. Mother said don't pack your bags. We ain't got no time for that. They shut the lights off in our neighborhood. Don't know if we're coming back. [pre-chorus]. I saw signs on the video. I saw signs looking back but you never know. Sunrise on the radio. Said the sharp bulbs long lines. The false signs come in stereo. Tip of my scale is like a wave. And I figured on. Don't know if I can let it go. I ain't got more time. So don't look down don't close your eyes. [chorus]. Fly closer to heaven and far from hell. Fly put your wings up so put your wings up. Fly far from the city we knew so well. Fly so put your wings up put your wings up. Time we say goodbye to the neighborhood. [verse 2].

What are we now for the love. Like animals just to find a home. Searching the horizon for a sign. All I see is dark but I sail on. I can hear my heart beat harder. I'm still here but not much farther. Now we sit now we walk. Now they turn us back down. I don't speak I don't stop. I just keep on moving. [chorus]. Fly closer to heaven and far from hell. Fly put your wings up so put your wings up. Fly far from the city we know so well. Fly so put your wings up so put your wings up. Time we say goodbye

the waltz,"You know it's the best i've seen. I'd never tell you that it don't mean a thing. I know it's the worst you've felt. You have every right to keep it to yourself. Caught in the game of war. Traded your heart for a hand better than before. Say I let you down. Oooh you pushed me out. I let you win. I let you win. I'm dancin' alone today. I can hear a waltz think it's calling out your name. It's saying I need you so. But please don't you say, don't you say. I let you down. But you, you pushed me out. I, I let you win. I let you win"
too easy,"Autumn wind turns again. The days are warm, start to fade. All that's here is still the same. Memories fall like rain. The only world I know. Steady as you go. It's too easy, it's too easy for you. It's too easy, it's too easy for you. Sinking in the sand of time. A measurable bind, I'll be fine. I'll burn a fire above the air. So Heaven is still on my side. Where is it tonight. No more allibies. It's too easy, it's too easy for you. It's too easy, it's too easy for you. Autumn wind turns again. The days are warm, start to fade"

With a trapt door to take care of all of them. Come away, come away now. You won't stand from afar. When you hear me sayin. Come away, come away now. Cause you're too close for me to call.

When you hear me sayin. Come away, come away now. Cause you're too close for me to call. BY Jaylson Lima"
