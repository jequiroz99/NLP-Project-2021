ballard of the sulphate strangler,"Are we rolling?. Here we go then. And one, two, three,. Two, two, three. A boy was born to Jack and Marge in 1951. And what is love, is love, is love. And what is done, is done. The baby grew in size and rage. Beyond his normal years. And when there's blood on every page. The diary ends in tears. One, two, three, four,. And I won't forget the strangler. He's a lesson to us all. A knight in shining armour. And nearly ten feet tall. I won't forget the strangler. He's the Bournemouth Buckaroo. His friends will always weep for him. And this I tell you true. I met him up in Finchley the man from TFA. He drove a black three-tonner containing our PA. He wore a thousand earrings and a diamond on his tooth. His multi-hued proboscis betrayed a stormy youth. The strangler on his roller-skates was over six foot ten. He had a double set of documents in the names of other men. Been on the road or off the road a thousand times since then. I only wish there'd come a chance to do it all again. And I won't forget the strangler. And nor will many more. Salute the mighty strangler. Hear the mighty strangler roar. I won't forget the strangler. He's as volatile as wind. If no one's getting loopy, then no one's getting chinned. Later in the saga, we come to chapter two. Of big Pete Rush the strangler, the Bournemouth Buckaroo. We hit the road together, the Blockheads and their crew. A gram of whiz, a drop of vod, a can of special brew. From Spain to San Francisco we blazed a funky trail. With occasional disbursements to keep the strangler out of jail. When we got to New York City we had to let him go. 'Cos the dramas going on backstage were better than the show. And I won't forget the strangler. And this point we drift apart. He said you placed a dagger now. Right in my strawberry tart. Full bound for death or glory. And worth his weight in gold. When the devil made the strangler, he threw away the mould. These are the scars of the life that I lead. The veins are from drink and the nose is from speed. A Stanley knife here which had me well geed. Do I get cut and do I not bleed?. Each purple patch upon my face. Shall rudely chart my fall from grace. I will not pass the Loving Cup until the patches all join up. Then Jenny came and told the news that big Pete Rush had died. And me and Baxter were so sad, it was a pity how we cried. The mighty sulphate strangler was the last one of his breed. Now he's got a white three-tonner and he's knocking out Godspeed. And I won't forget the strangler. And nor will many more. Salute the mighty strangler. Hear the mighty strangler roar. I won't forget the strangler. He's as volatile as wind. He takes the world's encumbrance. When it wasn't him who sinned. I won't forget the Strangler. I wish he hadn't died. Now he's hanging out with Lynott across the great divide. I won't forget the strangler. He's worth his weight in gold. When the devil made the strangler he threw away the mould. I won't forget the Strangler. I won't forget the Strangler. I won't forget the Strangler. I won't forget the Strangler"

I cover each item as issues arise. With a skein of fabric of tissue of lies. I'll fuck up your family, your future and friends. And I'll see you in hell before my story ends. I'm a reporter with senses and hunches. Somebody's daughter's turned into a junkie. I'm on a reporter's expenses and lunches. And a whiskey and water and I don't give a monkey's"

Let them stop and let them snore. We'll be glad that we were born. Motivation is the new sensation. The fantasy that keeps you fit. On the human assumption, you don't have the gumption. Get up and do your bit. Being daft is a therapy craft. Which sharpens up your wits. Totally enthusic about the music. and it shows in the face you sit, sit, sit.

Take the handcuffs away and please do what I say. 'Cos I hate the untouchable cast. I want to be normal in body and soul. And normal in thought, word and deed.

The first thing you get on your face, a smile. As secrets flourish in their space. So love will cherish every grace and style. When pressure's on another case. We get along without a trace of bile. Though memories we'll ne'er erase. Our happiness can run apace meanwhile. You wore a bandana, I wore navy blue. We met in Havana at quarter past two. Across the Savannah and down to the beach. You munched a banana, I nibbled a peach. You played a small solo, I muffled a drum. You offered a polo, I stuck with my gum. I danced a light polka, you threw a few hoops. I was Oscar Homolka, you were Marjorie Proops"

Where the wanderers welcome is kindest of all. I've come back to my darling, my sweet Donegal. We'll meet at the cross on the Rathmullen Road. Where the sight of Loch Swilly is a beauty bestowed. As we're counting our blessings away from the throng. We will hear the wild birds sing their Donegal song. Where the stranger is welcome to a true free for all. They named you, my darling, my brave Donegal. I raise up my glass at the end of the day. God bless every sunset o'er Donegal Bay. Sure nothing is sweeter wherever I roam. As the smell of the turf of my Donegal home. Where there's always a welcome and a how-d'you-my-call. Forever my darling, my sweet Donegal. Forever my darling, my sweet Donegal"

poo-poo in the prawn,"I took a sudden notion. To go down to the ocean. I got my suntan lotion. My flippers and my mask. In proper distribution. Of fully formed ablutions.

razzle in my pocket,"In my yellow jersey, I went out on the nick.. South Street Romford, shopping arcade. Got a Razzle magazine, I never paid. Inside my jacket and away double quick.. Good sense told me, once was enough. But I had a cocky eye on more of this stuff. With the Razzle in my pocket, back to have another peek. Instead of being sneeky I strolled inside,. I put my thieving hand on something rude. I walked right out with a silhouette of nudes. 'Hold on sonny' said a voice at my side. 'I think you've taken one of my books'. Passers by gave me dirty looks. 'Not me mister' I bravely lied. We stopped by the window of a jeweller's shop. 'If it's money for your lunch, I'd have given you a loan. Have you got any form, were you on your own?. Round to the station and we'll tell the cops'. 'I'm ever so ashamed, it was wicked and rash. Here's the book back, and here's the cash. I never stole before, I promise I'll stop'. 'Crime doesn't pay, you've got honest eyes. If we go to the law another thief is born. And I'll get the book back, creased and torn. So return what you've taken and apologise'. I gave him back his nudie book. I said I was sorry, I slung my hook. With the Razzle in my pocket as the second prize. Ian's diction is superbly clear, although he drops his H's in the. cockney manner. What's interesting is the verse form - this is a double. sonnet - four stanzas each of seven lines, with a rhyme structure. ABBABBA - evidence of Ian Dury's classical education. I'd suggest. pulling the mp3 of this song off Napster and having on the english.pl. website.."
really glad you came,"Although you think I'm sleeping as you get set to leave. I can see your shadow packing from underneath my sleeve. I swore I'd never live without your constant company. Tomorrow's empty bedroom would be the death of me. Times you tried to tell me today was not our day. Would see me in a fury or begging you to stay. When you told me there was someone else, self-pity filled my mind. Mocking my assurance and leaving sense behind. I'll keep the changes to myself - no chance that you'll respond. So clear was my reflection - I couldn't see beyond. And now you'll go and maybe so, I'll always be the same. Well thanks for looking in on me, I'm really glad you came. Now there's both sets of keys on the dresser and only one pair of shoes on the floor. Of the cases on top of the cupboard - there's two where there used to be four. Some sizable gaps in the bathroom and your presence is felt all the more. Although you think I'm sleeping as you get set to leave. I can see your shadow packing from underneath my sleeve. And there you go and yes I know, I'll always be the same. Well thanks for looking in on me - I'm really glad you came. Cos it was good, wasn't it?"

riding the outskirts of fantasy,"Little tests and odd requests. Who loves, who loves, who the best?. Little tasks, no questions asked. The traitor is at last unmasked. Little ploys, search and destroy. Who brings, who brings, who more joy?. Little snipes and frequent gripes. Taken in by all the hype. We're riding the outskirts of fantasy. We're riding, we're riding, we ride. We're hiding our loss of identity. We're keeping our secrets inside. Little tricks with walking sticks. Who gives, who gives, who more kicks?. Little smiles and wily wiles. Got your name down on our files. We're riding the outskirts of fantasy. We're riding, we're riding, we ride. We're hiding our loss of identity. We're keeping our secrets inside. I have done this and that. I have been here and there. I have tasted the fruit of the coco de mer. I've devoted myself to a life without care. And when all's said and done,. I've done more than my share. We're riding the outskirts of fantasy. We're riding, we're riding, we ride. We're hiding our loss of identity. We're keeping our secrets inside. Little games we name no names. Who lost, who lost, who more aims?. Little snares caught unawares. The cupboard underneath the stairs. We're riding the outskirts of fantasy. We're riding, we're riding, we ride. We're hiding our loss of identity. We're keeping our secrets inside"

the man with no face,"I first got the case of the man with no face, one evening in August last year. A telephone call told me nothing at all, and I made an appointment with fear. She was dressed to the nines on Parisian lines, her features were winsome and cool. She stuck half a grand in my hot little hand which is more than I get as a rule. I tried to look wise as she plied me with lies about husbands and random young men. And when she was through I said, ""Bollocks to you, you're talking to Lavatory Len"". ""You're not some poor tart who had a bad start, you're in with the heavy brigade"". ""You're up to some skank and to be very frank, I'm useless with shooters and blades"". ""To tell you the truth"", she said, ""I need a good sleuth to save me from murder or jail"". ""I've got over a ton of Kabul Number One and the victim of theft on my tail. I'm the private dick. I'm the private face. I'm the private eye. In the private place. She said, ""He's the real snag, he's the King of the Blag and he's known to be hard on the chase"". ""He stays in the shade when he's plying his trade and they call him the man with no face"". With no more ado, I said, ""No fucking thank you"", and I started to show her the door. When into my day stepped a man dressed in grey whose face was a mask - nothing more. He made it quite clear that he wanted his gear by jobbing me straight in the chops. It isn't much fun when the business gets done, but it's ever so nice when it stops. Whereupon I offered him coke which by way of a joke was a mixture of acid and smack. Like a jolly good sport he had a huge snort and was very soon flat on his back. I'm the private face. Reach for the sky. I'm the private dick. In the private eye. So we had it away for a year and a day with a three-ton truck and a tent. Our large lump of hash made us bundles of cash, 'cos we sold some wherever we went. And I ain't heard no trace of the man with no face, and I hope that's just how it stays. 'Cos we've got enough dope to be able to cope with our needs for the rest of our days. I'm the private dick. I'm the private face. I'm the private eye. In the private place"
the mumble rumble and the cocktail rock,"Woke up this morning in a state of shock. I heard a mumble rumble and a cocktail rock. ???? beat like a slide trombone. Goddess Diana plicking all alone. It's the mumble rumble. And the cocktail rock. You did the mumble rumble. And the cocktail rock. You do the m-m-m-mumble rumble. Cocktail rock. Ive laid around the weary drain.

the passing show,"When we were simple and naïve. We wore our feelings on our sleeve. As we've grown jaded and corrupt. Our manner's guarded and abrupt. Oh, how we'd smile most readily. Whilst ploughing on unsteadily. Now frowns are etched upon our face. We can no longer stand the pace. Although we've got to go, with the passing show. It doesn't ever mean, we haven't made the scene. And what we think we know, to what is really so. Is but a smithereen, of what it might have been. We'd sing in gay abandon then. We'd get it wrong and try again. As here we brood with doubts assailed. Nothing ventured, nothing failed. When life itself can chart the course. Then life's the product we endorse. When circumstances tell of death. We keep our counsel, save our breath. Although we've got to go, with the passing show. It doesn't ever mean, we haven't made the scene. And what we think we know, to what is really so. Is but a smithereen, of what it might have been. Our laughter rang around the world. When we were happy boys and girls. As now we baulk and hesitate. Encumbrance comes to those who wait. But when we're torn from mortal coil. We leave behind a counterfoil. It's what we did and who we knew. And that's what makes this story true. Although we've got to go, with the passing show. It doesn't ever mean, we haven't made the scene. And what we think we know, to what is really so. Is but a smithereen, of what it might have been. Although we've got to go, with the passing show.

twenty tiny fingers,"She put on the light in the middle of the night. The wet stuff's here let's go. I grabbed a sock, I called the Doc. He told me ""Don't be slow"". I got down there with time to spare. And then I sat on pins. Until the doctor shook my hand. And told me ""You've got twins"". Twenty tiny fingers. Twenty tiny toes. Two angel faces.

two old dogs without a name,"Two old dogs without a name. Trucking down the road to glory. Seeking not to blaze in fame. But to leave a blazing story. Being roadies is their game. Rough of trouser, hair of hoary. They're the ones you cannot tame. Backline front and morning Tory. Theirs, the lifestyle that surpasses. They're the coolest of the classes. Yours is blonde and mine's got glasses. Give them both their backstage passes. Euro dogs without a draw. Punching down the road to Stuttgart. Not 'til Munich will they score. There's just enough to have a kick start. Put the pedal through the floor. Whack this mother down the ausbahn. Band get in at half-past four. Sound check, sandwich and a sweetheart. Getting gear in, they're the masters. Couldn't rig it any faster. Break a leg in a disaster. Fix it with a sticky plaster. Two old dogs who know their gig. Piling feedback through the wedges. Hanging off the lighting rig. Miles of flex along the ledges. Twenty thousand make that big. Get more in around the edges. Turn up sweaty at the lig. Such the perks and privileges. They're the hardest of the grafters. Load the truck up to the rafters. Hear the sound of roadies laughter. In the hotel for their afters"

Wake up and make love with me. I don't want to make you. I'll let the fancy take you. And you'll wake up and make love. You come awake. In a horny morning mood. And have a proper wriggle. In the naughty naked nude. Roll against my body. Get me where you want me. What happens next is private. It's also very rude. I'll go and get the post. And make some tea and toast. You have another sleep, love. It's me that needs it most. Wake up and make love with me. Wake up and make love. Wake up and make love with me. I don't want to make you. I'll let the fancy take you.

what a waste!,"I could be the driver an articulated lorry. I could be a poet I wouldn't need to worry. I could be a teacher in a classroom full of scholars. I could be the sergeant in a squadron full of wallahs. What a waste. What a waste. What a waste. What a waste. CHORUS:. Because I chose to play the fool in a six-piece band,. First-night nerves every one-night stand.. I should be glad to be so inclined.. What a waste! What a waste!. But I don't mind.. I could be a lawyer with strategems and ruses. I could be a doctor with poultices and bruises. I could be a writer with a growing reputation. I could be the ticket man at Fulham Broadway Station. What a waste (x4). Repeat CHORUS. I could be the catalyst that sparks the revolution. I could be an inmate in a long-term institution. I could dream to wide extremes, I could do or die. I could yawn and be withdrawn and watch the world go by. What a waste (x4). Repeat CHORUS. (Repeat CHORUS with crescendo, then again with fade)."

you'll see glimpses,"[entirely spoken in lucid reflective manner]:. You'll see.. They think I'm off my crust as I creep about the caff.. But I'm really getting ready to surprise them all.. Because I'm busy sorting out the problems of the world.. And when I reveal all, I may get a crinkly mouth.. I've given my all to the task at hand unstintingly.. When it's all over, I'll rest on my laurels.. Here for a moment is a glimpse of my plan:. All kids will be happy learning things.. The wind will smell of wild flowers.. Nobody will whack each other about with nasty things.. All the room in the world.. They take me for a mug because I smile.. They think I'm too out of tune to mind being patronised.. All in all, it's been another phase in my chosen career,. And when my secrets are out, they'll bite their silly tongues.. All I want for my birthday is another birthday.. When skies are blue, we all feel the benefit.. Glimpse Number 2 for the listener.. Everyone will feel useful in lovely ways.. Trees will be firmly rooted in town and country.. Illness and despair will be dispensed with.. All the room in the world.. They ask me if I've had the voices yet.. They don't think I know any true answers.. It's true that I haven't quite finished yet.. When it all comes out in the wash, they'll eat their words.. I've got all their names and addresses.. Later on I'll write them each a thank-you letter.. Before I stop, here's a last glimpse into the general future.. Home rule will exist in each home, forever.. Every living thing will be another friend.. This wonderful state of affairs will last for always.. This has been got out by a friend.."
