Sparks ignite and trade them for thought. About no one. And nothing in particular. Washed the sickened socket and drove. Resent nothing. There’s good will inside of me. Wake me up lower the fever. Walking in a straight line. Set me on fire in the evening. Everything will be fine. Waking up strong in the morning. Walking in a straight line. Lately I’m a desperate believer. But walking in a straight line. Something I will never forget. I felt desperate. And stuck to the marrow. Invisible to everyone else. I’m a sex change. And a damsel with no heroine. Wake me up lower the fever. Walking in a straight line. Set me on fire in the evening. Everything will be fine. Waking up strong in the morning. Walking in a straight line. Lately I’m a desperate believer. But walking in a straight line. I don’t need no time to say. There’s no changing yesterday. If we keep talking and. I keep walking in straight lines.

To break my own fall. Take the rope to my heart and fall. You may just be the last before you. See the black tangled heart fall. Maybe departure's good. Makes room for more. Start to mass produce. For a chance to ignore. Maybe you'll kill yourself. Before I get a turn. Maybe I'll fall in love. And never learn. Take the rope to my heart and fall. You may just be the last before you. See the black tangled heart fall. Take the rope to my heart and fall. You may just be the last before you. See the black tangled heart fall

Everybody's sitting 'round watching television!. London's burning with boredom now. London's burning dial 99999. I'm up and down the Westway, in an' out the lights.

London's burning dial 99999. Now in the subway and I'm looking for the flat. This one leads to this block, this one leads to that. The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home. I run through the empty stone because I'm all alone. London's burning with boredom now.... London's burning dial 99999."

Stand up while your conscience sits aside. I’ve made up my mind. Half of the time and I feel so low. Stay and hijack the hurt. I feel so low I feel so high. Take a look inside my mind. If the object was clear. There wouldn’t be a point. Only godless fear. By the end of July. I wonder will I still feel so low. Oh I am host to a guide. Moving in time. And falling in line. I’ve made up my mind. The papers are signed. And I feel so low. Stay and hijack the hurt. I feel so low I feel so high. Take a look inside my mind. Once a lover. Never suffer. So far away from here. Feeling hollow. Head to toe so low. Stay and hijack the hurt. I feel so low I feel so high. Take a look inside my mind. . © Daniel Johns 2007. . (fonte: site oficial)

Though you had the world at your feet. You could see it I was blind. Had the perfect job called life. You didn't like it you resigned. Brain's a square of grass. Growing on petrol and chlorine. On petrol and chlorine. You know just what I mean.

pop song for us rejects,Addiction's held you back. But you don't care. 'Cause you're on a high again. And it's not fair. Consuming alcohol. While I gotta drive. Take a hit from the drugs you stole. And try to survive. Since your life was over. You haven't yet been sober. You have held me back so long. Everything you do is wrong. Now I gotta dump you. Continue my life too. I tried to help you. Don't care what you do. You're state of mind's improved. But we're still apart. I visited you'd moved. Don't know where to start. Your life's an open cold sore. Got to get out the cream. Now I'm thinking positive. But I know it's a dream. You died yesterday.

ramble,When I found my thoughts. It seems I'm missing myself. In the dark of the night in the ocean of time. So I pick between the cracks. In the time that I ride. But the soul madders drives. And the veins in the sky. Picture something real. Something I can feel. Because the truth feels like a movie. Chorus:. All u do is ramble. Discarding life of shambles. Ramble to break a silence. Open up and ramble. To break the silence. And open your mind. Leave it behind you!. Now when I'm good an gazed. To its a clear sky coz nothings secure. Camp behind bars. And I love everything. You've learnt to ignore. But u don't want to hear. If you've heard it before. Picture something real. Something I can feel. You take a life. And make every watch again. Chorus:. All u do is ramble. Discarding life of shambles. Ramble to break a silence. Open up and ramble. To break the silence. And open your mind. Leave it behind you!. Open up your eyes. Thinking bout all of the things. You were never sure x 2. Coz all u do is ramble. So life is in a candle. Ramble to break a silence. Open up and ramble. To break the silence. And open your mind. Leave it behind you!
reflections of a sound,In the sun we are found to be. Reflections of a sound. I know it’s been far too long in stormy weather. My arrested hope won’t choke forever. Like a memory I needed never. We walk wrapped in thought. Some are vacant some have grown too short. It’s the only thing I’ve ever had that keeps me lonely. In the sun we are found to be. Reflections of a sound. When nobody is around. Come down from the waist of time. Feel so empty when I feel so fine. Starting over we could change this light shadow sober. I’ve been waiting for far too long. Let’s stick together. Coz you’re keeping me warm but it’s a lonely setting sun. I wait so long now my head is full of pressure. I need time to cure my mind. It’s like a loop that lasts forever. I’ve been waiting for far too long. Let’s stick together. Coz you’re keeping me warm but it’s a lonely setting sun. In the sun we are found to be. Reflections of a sound. For nobody. . © Daniel Johns 2007. . (fonte: site oficial)
roses,Drained as drained can be. Life is gone from me. Drained if drained is free. If only I could breathe. Smelling dead roses 2x. Take your mind with you. There's no room for two. I can't handle both. Handle both of you. Smelling dead roses 2x. But I won't fall down. No I won't fall down. But I won't fall down. No I won't fall down. Smelling dead roses 2x. But I won't fall down. No I won't fall down. But I won't fall down. No I won't fall down..

slave,"Lived too long now you've come to take me. To a place where I can die. Lost my soul, lost my confidence in me. Can't be something but I'll try. Lived too long and waited to just drown. In my self pity I keep falling down. Want to be your soldier. Want to be your slave. I have no pride in myself. Only book that I own is called 'how to lose'. Pick a chapter, I know them all, just choose. Lived too long and waited to find. A place where I can die. Lost my soul, lost my confidence in me. Can't be something but I'll try. Want to be your soldier. Want to be your slave. I have no pride in myself. That's how I behave"
sleep all day,Take your mama's gun. Seal up the barrel tight. Sleep tomorrow son. Exit for another night. I know it's a secret. Speaking about where the rumble came but. I don't see any inspiration in big lies. All I say. You think it's crazy. But I got these papers to prove I'm only sick. I don't see any inspiration in clear skies. So I sleep all day. Got the ways ahead. Looking less like and high. Seem to disappear. As soon as you were by my side. Get your daddy's car. Scratch the doors and call it aaah. Who's your daddy now. Take the thing right from the start. I know it's a secret. Speaking about where the rumble came but. I don't see any imitation in big lights. All I say. You think it's crazy. But I got these papers to prove I'm only sick. I don't see any inspiration in clear skies. So I sleep all day

straight lines,Breathing from a hole in my lung. I had no one. But faces in front of me. Racing through the void in my head. To find traces of a good luck academy. Sparks ignite and trade them for thought. About no one. And nothing in particular. Washed the sickened socket and drove. Resent nothing. There’s good will inside of me. Wake me up lower the fever. Walking in a straight line. Set me on fire in the evening. Everything will be fine. Waking up strong in the morning. Walking in a straight line. Lately I’m a desperate believer. But walking in a straight line. Something I will never forget. I felt desperate. And stuck to the marrow. Invisible to everyone else. I’m a sex change. And a damsel with no heroine. Wake me up lower the fever. Walking in a straight line. Set me on fire in the evening. Everything will be fine. Waking up strong in the morning. Walking in a straight line. Lately I’m a desperate believer. But walking in a straight line. I don’t need no time to say. There’s no changing yesterday. If we keep talking and. I keep walking in straight lines. Wake me up lower the fever. Walking in a straight line. Set me on fire in the evening. Everything will be fine. Waking up strong in the morning. Walking in a straight line. Lately I’m a desperate believer. But walking in a straight line. . © Daniel Johns 2007. . (fonte: site oficial)
strange behaviour,This is tearing me apart. If the sun won't shine. Forever will never be fine. Underneath the hollow ground. Lies a night time sky. For only a desperate eye. When I'm paranoid I see walls behind walls behind walls. When I'm over joyed I see falls over falls over falls. When I'm all alone I'll be wary and careful to. Only eat with uncles. Never talk to strangers. God is in the kitchen. Faking baby dangers. Change whatever karma means. For the only things that end never truly begin. If this streets air ain't up to par. I'll take my clothes and take this strange behaviour. Not only liked but loved as well. If this streets air ain't up to par. I'll take my clothes and take this strange behaviour. Not only liked but loved as well. If this keeps tearing me apart. The walls come down won't stop this empty feeling. For everything apart from this

the man that knew too much,There was a man that knew too much. With a panic attic mind but a chance to numb. His golden touch to ignore the will of time. Had me struck down open to the fact. I was standing in a line with a broken occupation on my back. Time is not a moment we’re letting slip away. There’s nothing left to say it’s changing every day. The way I’m thinking in different shades of grey. It’s not enough to say that this is my love. He had the anti midas touch. Temporary state of mind. But a chance to die enhances growth. Now I’m trembling all the time. Stumble round making faces on the scene. Scene what what. Stumble round make your faces on your own. Time is not a moment we’re letting slip away. There’s nothing left to say it’s changing every day. The way I’m thinking in different shades of grey. It’s not enough to say that this is my love. I’m not your mocking bird. That sings your cellar song. She got a paper run. You’re compensated. Can we all gather round on the scene. Can we all move around on our own. Are ya a mover shaker all alone. Time is not a moment we’re letting slip away. There’s nothing left to say it’s changing every day. The way I’m thinking in different shades of grey. It’s not enough to say. Time is not a moment we’re letting slip away. There’s nothing left to say but this is my love. I’m not your mocking bird. That sings your cellar song. She got a paper run to write your letters wrong. . © Daniel Johns 2007. . (fonte: site oficial)
those thieving birds (part 1),Those thieving birds. Hang strung from an empty nest. This swan plagued pond. Foresaken and under whelmed. Those leaving words. Hang strong from an emptiness. Hang strong from an emptiness. Those thieving birds. Hang strung from an empty nest
those thieving birds (part 2),Lonely in life. Dead or alive. If the truth had incursions. No more goodbyes. No more big lies. If the truth had versions. As long as you and I are together. I'll hold onto the jewellery. Like staple strapped clenched fist and tongs. Hang strung from an empty nest. Those thieving birds. Hang strung from an empty nest

The only way to get there's to go straight down.. There's no bathroom, and there is no sink.. The water out of the tap is very, hard to drink,. Very hard to drink.. You, wait till tomorrow. You, wait till tomorrow. You say the money, isn't everything,. But I'd like to see you live without it.. You think you can keep on going living like a king.. Oohh babe, but I strongly doubt it.. Very hard to drink.. You gonna wait till, fat boy,. Fat boy, wait until tomorrow"
too much of not enough,She tripped on a hole that I'd dug in the soil. To be part of a human garden and I couldn't. Stand in the straight postured sun. But you stood in the mud which came unsoiled. When I came along. You never stop needing. You never stop needing. A close look at something. So close. It's too much of not enough. A close look at something. So close. It's too much of not enough. When all we need is just a taste. I strapped myself in for a safe saccharide. Before it started I tried to be anything I saw fit. And it all seemed to fit but you came undone. When I came along. You never stop needing. You never stop needing. A close look at something. So close. It's too much of not enough. A close look at something. So close. It's too much of not enough. When all we need is just a taste. Blind white lies and shallow truth. Broken strings and stolen youth. I've seen too much of not enough but. You came much closer than they had before. It's too much of not enough. You came much closer than they had before. It's too much of not enough. You came much closer than they had before. It's too much of not enough. You came much closer than they had before. You never stop needing. And it's good for nothing

tuna in the brine,"I found keys to my heart. when everyone's heart seems so calm. And you found the lock to my dorm. and opened the doors to my trust. Find? My vestry....

undecided,"Ohh, there's no time,. To choose for yourself.. It's like the candle's lit at both ends now,. Deteriorating health.. Parent's breakin' up,. Wish they would decide,. Whether to stay together. Can't make up their minds,. They wonder why you need someone,. You get no freedom at all.. They want you to drop down and conform,. They make your self-esteem fall.. Undecided, can't make up their mind. Your parents collided and left you behind. If there's a lock to their minds,. Can you tell me please.. I'll be straight,. Straight to get the keys.. [Chorus]. Her mother doesn't even know her name.... Undecided.. If there is trouble, well she just gets the blame,. But denies it.. [Chorus]."
untitled,I'm just another body down. Internal bleeding round and round. And all I can think of are Ways to die alone. And all I can think of are Ways to die alone. A portrait of my skeletal gain. Left selfish and hungry so feed me the pain. Escape reality with new pain. Then let the cycle start again. And all I can think of are Ways to die alone. And all I can think of are Ways to die alone. Dream of content A pain filtered farm. All I can say. Dreams are bad When all they do. Is leave the truth behind. Dreams are bad When negativity's. A state of mind. Dreams are bad When all they do. Is leave the truth behind. Dreams are bad
waiting all day,I took advantage. Of a straight believing town. That tore the bandage. And said look who’s bleeding now. Are you listening or are you faithless like the others. Long days are almost here. Faded signs for you. I’ll be waiting all day. I've be waiting all year. For you it’s true. He’s been beaten. Might have brought it on himself. So he stopped reading. Every book on mental health. But alls not lost in this tangle like no other. Long days are almost here. Faded signs for you. I’ll be waiting all day. I’ve be waiting all year. For you it’s true. Take this dose and go. Whiskey warm September. The faded sign will show. That he still remembers. Long days are almost here. Faded signs for you. I’ll be waiting all day. I’ve be waiting all year. For you it’s true. Waiting all day. Waiting all year. I’ll be waiting all day. I’ll be waiting all year. . © Daniel Johns 2007. . (fonte: site oficial)

without you,Miles Away. There's hopeless smiles brighter than mine. And I need for you to come and go. Without the truth falling out.. Old incisions refusing to stay. Like sun through the trees on a cloudy day. You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat. But it melts in the sun like a life without love. And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on. Without You. Telephone. Socially scared and impaired. If the trees will bloom the wind can blow. Without the fruit falling out. Old incisions refusing to stay. Like sun through the trees on a cloudy day. You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat. But it melts in the sun like a life without love. And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on. Without You. Feels like the wind blows. Holding you with us. She takes no other. False light and ashes. Blooming like winter. You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat. But it melts in the sun like a life without love. And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on. Without You
world upon your shoulders,"All the bridges in the world. Won't save you. If there is no other side. To cross to. When you're not feeling ugly. And the world's not too much. Take the world upon your shoulders. And burn, burn, burn, burn, burn. Half full glasses. Lost in empty houses. Violent, big and violent. Like a thing that's big, big. And violent"
young modern station,Stalled at young modern station. Arthritic conversation. Life has a dead line lately. Allergic and in the news. The clocks are ticking timeless. Dead Dali days behind us. The band is back together. Allergic and in the news. Does it make you cry. When I make you feel so far away. The interviews over. Stuck to the goal. To rescue my skin. I need a different liquor. So sick of getting sicker. And I’m moving back to the country. Allergic and in the news. Does it make you cry. When I make you feel so far away. The interviews over. Stuck to the goal. To rescue my skin. You’re so far away. The interviews over. He dreams of tracks and choices. I think I’m hearing voices. Does it make you cry. When I make you feel so far away. The interviews over. Stuck to the goal. To rescue my skin. You’re so far away. The interviews over. . © Daniel Johns 2007. . (fonte: site oficial)
