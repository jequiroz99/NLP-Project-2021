digging the grave (cover),It would be wrong to ask you why. Because I know what goes inside. Is only half of what comes out. Isn't that what it's about?. It's about to remind us we're alive. To remind us we're not blind. In that big black hole. Comfortable. Digging the grave I got it made. Let something in or throw something out?. You left the door open wide. I know you have a reason why. That knot is better left untied. I just went and undid mine. It takes some time. And the shadows so big. It takes the sun out of the day. And the feeling goes away. If you close the door. Comfortable
femme fatale,"Here she comes. You better watch your steps. She's gonna break your heart in two. It's true. It's not hard to realize. Just look into her false colored eyes. She builds you up to just put you down. What a clown. 'Cause everybody knows (she's a femme fatale). The things she does to please (she's a femme fatale). She's just a little tease (she's a femme fatale). See the way she walks, hear the way she talks. You're put down in her book. You're number 37, have a look. She's going to smile to make you frown. What a clown. Little boy, she's from the street. Before you start, you're already beat. She's gonna play you for a fool. Yes, it's true. 'Cause everybody knows (she's a femme fatale). The things she does to please (she's a femme fatale). She's just a little tease (she's a femme fatale). See the way she walks, hear the way she talks"
if i think (mudhoney cover),"I forgot how to breathe. I forgot just what I need. Saw the world laid out before me. I saw everything so small. If I think, I think of you. If I think, I think of you. I open my eyes. Watch the sky turn blue. I felt so good I almost forgot. All about you. I forgot how to cry. I forgot I could die. And I'm so sick of what I need. I could close my eyes and fall. If I think, I think of you. If I think, I think of you. I open my eyes. Watch the sky turn blue. I felt so good I almost forgot. All about you"
ignorin'u,"I am ignoring you. I will ignore you. I am ignoring you. I will ignore you. 'Cause your heart is. So full of this shit!. And I will ignore you. Don't bring me your sorrows. Don't bring me your jealousy. Don't drown me in your mood. That kind of thing you do. 'Cause I was not born to be. The princess up the tower. Oh, you can't keep me. Quiet and tied in this bloody cage. I am ignoring you. I will ignore you. I am ignoring you. I will ignore you. 'Cause your heart is. So full of this shit!. And I will ignore you. I am not waiting for. A prince on a white horse just to save me. I know I have to do by myself. And this time I will be free. I am ignoring you. I will ignore you. I am ignoring you.

inside the beer bottle (com cascadura),"I'm at a bar without a name. Lookin' through a beer bottle. People around seems to be so lonely. Just like me. Now I'm walking down the streets.

I cry until you hear. Dance, dance, close to me. Inside the beer bottle. Dance, dance, close to me. Inside the beer bottle. Dance, dance, close to me. Inside the beer bottle.

just now,"My child, so much to learn. Feel my breast feed yourself, feeding me. So let me spoil you, let me adore you. Now and just now. 'Cause I know someday. I'll have to let you go. And you know, I'll be your home if you need. And take your time, just like the way that should be. What am I supposed to do besides watch you sleep?. Now and just now. I'm running through de field. Before I let you go. Then the season changes. When the need becames. You're just blooming now. Carefully, beautifully. Even when you won't be around. Remember you have heard this sound. It was about how I cared and how I felt. Then, and just then. Maybe you realize. That I'll never let you go"

the kill (pitty e 30 seconds to mars),"What if I wanted to break. Laugh it all off in your face. What would you do?. E se eu desmoronar?. Se não pudesse mais aguentar. O que você faria?. Come break me down. Bury me, bury me. I am finished with you. E se eu quisesse lutar?. Pelo resto da vida implorar. O que você faria?. You say, you wanted more. What are you waiting for. I'm not running from you. Come break me down. Bury me, bury me. I am finished with you. Look in my eyes. You're killing me, killing me. All I wanted was you.

This is who I really am"
