sleepwalking,"Nineteen years gone away. The kids have grown up. These trains don't run anymore. How the view from the window's changed. Over my bones, people talk and talk. Do we all commit to. You'd see so much more of the world today. If you take into sleepwalking. The last thing that you heard must have been. I'll change, I'll change. I'll change. Time travelling makes an antique of yourself. The curtains pulled wide. The unveiling of a museum piece. Small price to pay, small price to pay. For this freedom of choice. You'd see so much more of the world today. If you take into sleepwalking. The last thing that you heard must have been. I'll change, I'll change. I'll change. Out of date, at the right place at the wrong time. Don't let them take it away. Out of place but a lucky escape. Rescued at last. You'd see so much more of the world today. If you take into sleepwalking. The last thing that you heard must have been. I'll change, I'll change. I'll change"
