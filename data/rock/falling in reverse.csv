losing my mind,"I've got the motherfucking world in my palm now. don't tell me to calm down. Striking a match, igniting the track. while I'm typing in caps, it's on now. The rap Casanova with cash in a sofa. n the back of a Rover. Six-pack in a backpack and I'm cracking 'em open. sipping I'm trapped in a moment. Open your eyes 'cause you're never gonna know. if your next move might be your last. Living a lie, everybody's always gonna bring up my past. Well, I'm past that, my interest up and my bag's packed. I'm the Nasdaq with a bad rap so. I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing. You're pointing the blame, you know. I'm not ready to choose. So don't get confused and stay the hell out of my way. So why do you believe. You're losing your mind, losing your mind again. In everyone but me?. I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again. I've seen the hardships, lived in darkness. through the mud into the marshes. My reputation is tarnished but regardless, I am awesome. Saw the gossip from my lockup go colossal. Then I blossomed to the boss of this rock stuff. And I'm never gonna stop till the cops come. What I'm really trying to say. Is say it to my face. and if you won't, stay the fuck out my way. Rocking shows, lock and load, stop me, no. I'm repping the new shit, the essence of music. I'm blessed with the fusion of both. I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing.

In everyone but me?. I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again. Ever since I was a little boy. I always thought that the world. was going to end in my lifetime. So I try to seize every opportunity as it came to me. Because I believed it might stop the sky. from falling down one more day. But the older I got, the more I realized. that I cannot save the world. I'm not a superhero, I'm not perfect. I'm just me, a human being. So let's take, take, take the throne and break the cycle. So why do you believe everyone but me?. Every single day we kill our idols. But you won't break me down. You're losing your mind, losing your mind again. You're losing your mind, losing your mind again. We're losing our minds, losing our minds. I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing. You're pointing the blame, you know. I'm not ready to choose. So don't get confused and stay the hell out of my way. So why do you believe. You're losing your mind, losing your mind again. In everyone but me?. I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again. I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing.

the drug in me is you,"I heard a knock upon my door the other day,. I opened it to find death staring in my face.. The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates.. Everywhere I go I drag this coffin just in case.. My body's tremblin', sends shiver down my spine,. Adrenaline kicks in shifts into overdrive.. Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive.. Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice.. I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down,. The kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house.. I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the had of doubt.. Running from my past, I'm praying. Feet, don't fail me now.. I've lost my god damn mind. it happens all the time.. I can't believe I'm actually. meant to be here,. trying to consume.. The drug in me is you. And I'm so high on misery,. Can't you see?. I got these questions always running through my head,. So many things that I would like to understand.. If we are born to die and we all die to live,. The what's the point of living life if it just contradicts?. I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down,. the kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house.. I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt.. Running from my past, I'm praying.

Can't you see?. I've lost. Myself,. You tried to reach me, but you just can't help me.. So long, goodbye.. You tried to save me, it won't work this time.. Cause now,. I've lost my fucking mind. And there's no fucking time.. I can't believe I'm actually. Meant to be here,. Trying to consume.. The drug in me is you. And I'm so high on misery,. Can't you see?. Oh, can't you see?.

game over,"My life's like a video game. Trying hard to beat the stage. All while I am still collecting coins. Trying hard to save the girl. Obstacles, I'm jumping hurdles. I'm growing up to be a big boy. A battle with a evil ways. I travel far and try and say. Sorry but your princess isn't here (Hahahaha). I take a rest, I push the pause. Level up, and move along. In hopes that the next stage I will clear (Fucking passed asshole). I'm just trying. To keep from dying. (Chorus). It's just a game that we play. And for heavens sake. Looking for a better way to play it. Life is for keeping score. And forevermore. Stop complaining, and start changing it. Today I went to therapy. Told him my embarrasing. Issues that I'm having with my life. He told me that I need to change. Life is not a videogame. So stop playing and open up your eyes (Hahaha). I'm just trying. To keep from dying. Chorus*. Don't talk about it. Just be about it. Don't ever doubt it. Even when your brain is crowded. I may be crazy. But life's amazing. And through it all and even with your problems facing. So just know that it's okay. My life is like a video game. Trying hard to beat the stage. All while I am still collecting coins. Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, select, start"
it's over when it's over,"I've got my life laid out in front of me like roads drawn on the map. I've had so many times where I slipped off the beaten path. I took the time to see the picture and for what it's worth. I'd walk a thousand miles without my shoes to make it work. I swore to God that I'm never coming back. Kept my faith when I was clapped. Staring at the wall through a crack in the floor. And these metal doors, they've got me trapped. I gotta remind myself that my mind is strong so that I won't lose my head. I've got my demons that I fight with, every little thought in every breath. I wear my heart up on my sleeve so my soul's exposed. And I carry this disease, the weight of the holy ghost. God, can you hear me? God is missing. Take it back, take it back, my friend. All the things that you said about the end. This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over. Give it up, give it up, my friend. The score is settled even if you won't admit. Set it down, final hour without a doubt, it's over when it's over. You've got your life laid out in front of you, like a car crash. I'm cautious at the wheel cause you were driving too fast. But if you took the time to check up in your rearview mirror. You'd see the things you're driving from or your biggest fears. You gotta get back up from the wreckage above and walk right through the fire. No matter what happens, the fact is that the flames keep getting higher. You gotta keep it going, keep tiptoeing through the fire and the flames and the pain of knowing. Through all this doubt, gotta keep on going, gotta give that spark, gotta keep on glowing. I wear my heart up on my sleeve so my soul's exposed. And I carry this disease, the weight of the holy ghost. God, can you hear me? God is missing. Take it back, take it back, my friend. All the things that you said about the end. This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over. Give it up, give it up, my friend. The score is settled even if you won't admit. Set it down, final hour without a doubt, it's over when it's over. So please, please, just let me make my peace. I refuse to let your words be the death of me. Please, please, just let me live my life. Stop living in my shadow and just make it right. It's over, make it right. Take it back, take it back, my friend. All the things that you said about the end.

i'm not a vampire,"Well I'm not a vampire. But I feel like one. Sometimes I sleep all day. Because I hate the sunlight. Hands are always shaking. Bodies always aching. In the darkness when I feed. Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed. With me. And Whisky seems to be my Holy Water. Mothers better lock your doors. And hide your daughters. I'm insane!. Well, I can feel it in my bones!. Coursing through my veins!. When did I become so cold?. For goodness sake!. Where is my self control?. If home is where my heart is. Then my heart has lost all hope. Well I'm not a zombie. But I feel like one today!. Sell me pills, comatose!. Chemical daze!. My head is always spinning. From this dizzy blurry vision. And my stomach has had enough!. I feel like a lady. That is pregnant with a baby. Cause I'm always throwing up! *blergh!*. Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict!. *Hi, Ronnie!*. Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath!. I'm insane!. Well, I can feel it in my bones!. Coursing through my veins!. When did I become so cold?. For goodness sake!. Where is my self control?. If home is where my heart is. Then my heart has lost all hope. God bless all of you now!. Cause I'm going straight to Hell!. And I'm taking you down with me!. Cause you know damn well. I'm insane!. Well, I can feel it in my bones!. Coursing through my veins!. When did I become so cold?. I'm insane!. Well, I can feel it in my bones!. Coursing through my veins!. When did I become so cold?.

chemical prisioner,I walk a fine line between coping and insanity. The right pills right now would be the wrong time. I have a hard time between flying and sobriety. The wrong thrill strong will to keep myself alive. I've watched this rip apart my family. Fuck that I'd rather die with honor. But when the drug is runnin' through me I can feel no pain. It's not worth the price I pay. It's so hard to be together. And I try and I try. But it won't get better. Forever. Days go days go by. I won't die I won't die cause. But I must I must try. Forever. I missed a phone call from a friend I knew the other day. It was strange and it changed my life forever. A couple days go by I found out that he passed away. The right drug wrong time he'll be remembered. There's two wolves that battle in us all right now. Ones good the other one is evil. If your wonderin wolf inside will succeed. It's simple it's the one that you feed. I am dead inside but I'm not allowed to die. There is truth in every lie and I am very much alive. But I've died a thousand times there is truth in every lie

don't mess with ouija boards,"From the depths of Hell. So far I fell. A deal made with the devil. After all the dust had settled. There's an hourglass of time. Counting down all of the lies. And with every grain of sand. Time is slipping through my hands. Oh! I sold my soul to rock n roll. I let my demons take control. Redemption seems so far away. This microphone is my escape. Don't mess with Ouija Boards. Cause now my spirits soared. I'm bound by fear of being trapped. I'm falling faster, fade to black. Something's standing in my way. Hoping for better days. I'm always searching. For serenity. And I'm always standing. At the edge of reality. Oh!. I spill my heart out on the stage. The only way I feel okay. And right before that curtain calls. I've just got one more thing to say. Don't mess with Ouija Boards. Cause now my spirits soared. I'm always searching. For serenity. And I'm always standing. At the edge of reality. Oh!. From the depths of Hell. So far I fell. A deal made with the devil. After all the dust had settled. Look into my eyes. You will see the light. It burns to blind. This way we'll never die.

chemical prisioner,I walk a fine line between coping and insanity. The right pills right now would be the wrong time. I have a hard time between flying and sobriety. The wrong thrill strong will to keep myself alive. I've watched this rip apart my family. Fuck that I'd rather die with honor. But when the drug is runnin' through me I can feel no pain. It's not worth the price I pay. It's so hard to be together. And I try and I try. But it won't get better. Forever. Days go days go by. I won't die I won't die cause. But I must I must try. Forever. I missed a phone call from a friend I knew the other day. It was strange and it changed my life forever. A couple days go by I found out that he passed away. The right drug wrong time he'll be remembered. There's two wolves that battle in us all right now. Ones good the other one is evil. If your wonderin wolf inside will succeed. It's simple it's the one that you feed. I am dead inside but I'm not allowed to die. There is truth in every lie and I am very much alive. But I've died a thousand times there is truth in every lie

don't mess with ouija boards,"From the depths of Hell. So far I fell. A deal made with the devil. After all the dust had settled. There's an hourglass of time. Counting down all of the lies. And with every grain of sand. Time is slipping through my hands. Oh! I sold my soul to rock n roll. I let my demons take control. Redemption seems so far away. This microphone is my escape. Don't mess with Ouija Boards. Cause now my spirits soared. I'm bound by fear of being trapped. I'm falling faster, fade to black. Something's standing in my way. Hoping for better days. I'm always searching. For serenity. And I'm always standing. At the edge of reality. Oh!. I spill my heart out on the stage. The only way I feel okay. And right before that curtain calls. I've just got one more thing to say. Don't mess with Ouija Boards. Cause now my spirits soared. I'm always searching. For serenity. And I'm always standing. At the edge of reality. Oh!. From the depths of Hell. So far I fell. A deal made with the devil. After all the dust had settled. Look into my eyes. You will see the light. It burns to blind. This way we'll never die. I speak the truth. Immortalized by you. No other way. Until my final day. Oh, I feel the hate. Boiling up inside. And it's too late. Nowhere to run and hide!. Don't mess with Ouija Boards. Don't mess with Ouija Boards. I'm bound by fear of being trapped. I'm falling faster, better days. I'm always searching. For serenity (better days). I'm always searching. For serenity.

goodbye graceful,"Can't believe that I survived. I fell so hard but I'm alive. Standing in front of the gates of Hell. With a glass of ice water in my hand. Laying at the edge of my bed.

When I was in my darkest days. And I'm so thankful. That you were able, you were able. To save me from the burning flames. And make me who I am today. I've been running for the longest time.

When I was in my darkest days. And I'm so thankful. That you were able, you were able. To save me from the burning flames. And make me who I am today. Picking up the pieces of my life from the floor. Searching for an open window or an exit door. This boulder on my shoulder it gets heavier and colder. Til the day that die somehow I'll be slowly rolling over. To all the people I've done wrong, now I apologize. To all the girls of the world whose tears I made them cry. I know it's been a while and you have traveled many miles. To get away , it's not my song I wrote this song to make you smile"

Staring at the wall through a crack in the floor. And these metal doors, they've got me trapped. I gotta remind myself that my mind is strong so that I won't lose my head.

You'd see the things you're driving from or your biggest fears. You gotta get back up from the wreckage above and walk right through the fire. No matter what happens, the fact is that the flames keep getting higher. You gotta keep it going, keep tiptoeing through the fire and the flames and the pain of knowing. Through all this doubt, gotta keep on going, gotta give that spark, gotta keep on glowing. I wear my heart up on my sleeve so my soul's exposed. And I carry this disease, the weight of the holy ghost. God, can you hear me? God is missing. Take it back, take it back, my friend. All the things that you said about the end.

Please, please, just let me live my life. Stop living in my shadow and just make it right. It's over, make it right. Take it back, take it back, my friend. All the things that you said about the end.

Addicted to the pain I cause myself. My head is floating somewhere in the clouds. While I'm paid to entertain a lively crowd. They sing my songs and feel my pain cause pain is what creates my fame. A vicious cycle some day I'll get out. I can't believe I'm standing here at all I can't believe I made it this far. On my way with a smile on my face to the top and I'm not falling off. All I need is a microphone I'll sing about the things that have been hurting me. It's safe to say all the kids I relate to their lives so just keep holding on. It's hard enough try walking in my shoes. To be picked on by my peers to much abuse. And I'm tired of not fitting in. True friends are my final wish just let me be myself and make it through. I have tried so hard to be a better soul. I have worked so hard at making myself whole. And through it all my better years are still ahead my mind is clear just trust me when I say I'm in control. I believe I'm just like you. I believe I'll make it through. It's hard to see at times like this, I'm not giving in, I'm not givin in"

the bitter end,"Lost in a moment of time. Self destruct switch on. I try. But it happens the same. Everyday. Here I go standing on the edge. Holding on to the bitter end.

But you best believe that it's haunting me. Stuck inside this fucking mind. Goodbye. I will shut down. Mission abort down for the count. Stuck in a cycle. Trapped in a nightmare. Losing what matters. See if I fight fair. I'm afraid I'm afraid. This is what I can't be. Get away, get away. I just want to be happy. I set sail on a voyage unknown. Aboard a vessel that I call my soul. And I've been searching for what makes me whole. Sinking in the ocean on an empty boat. Take me home I'm lost alone"
