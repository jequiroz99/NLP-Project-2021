The record shows I took the blows. And did it my way"

a thing called love,"Six foot six stood on the ground, weighted 235 pounds. But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his. knees by love. He was the kind of man who would gamble on love. Look you in the eye and never back up. But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love. Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands. Like the rules that govern our land. Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this. thing called love. It can lift you up, it can put you down. Take your world and turn it all around. Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger. than love. Men like me they worry and doubt. Trouble their minds day in and day out. Too busy a livin' to worry about a thing called love. And then I see a mother's tenderness. As she holds her young close to her breast"
a whistling tune,(Words & music by Edwards - David). Did you ever notice when the sun goes down. Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound. It's a whistling tune for walking in the night. If you listen you can hear it in the breeze. Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees. It's a whistling tune for walking in the night. And the murmuring waters sing the song. The echoing mountains hum along. The whispering valleys fill the air. With a whistling tune our hearts can share. It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon. Listening to old mother nature's favorite tune.

Only I know, what it's worth. Knowing you're mine, forever. Is the greatest wonder on earth. Nothing can change it, the magic's begun. When we're together, our hearts become one. I find a happiness, I've never known. When we're in, a world of our own"

That you're moving on the back roads. By the rivers of my memory and for hours. You're just gentle on my mind. Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines. And the junk yards and the highways come between us. And some other woman's cryin' to her mother. 'Cause she turned and I was gone. I still might run in silence. Till' the join might stain my face. And the summer sun might burn me 'till I'm blind. But not to where I cannot see you. Walking in the back roads. By the rivers flowing gently on my mind.

"go east, young man","(Words & music by Giant - Baum - Kaye). I'm gonna go where the desert sun is. Go where I know the fun is. Go where the harem girls dance. Go where there's love and romance. Out on the burning sands, in some caravan. I'll find adventure, while I can. To say the least, go on, go east young man. Go east young man, go east young man. You'll feel like a sheik, so rich and grand. With dancing girls at your command. Go eat and drink and feast, go east young man. I'm gonna go where the night's enchanted. Go where those dreams are granted. When paradise starts calling, into some tent I'm crawling. I hear those desert drums, and when nighttime comes. Then I'll make love the way I planned. To say the least, go on, go east young man. Go east young man, go east young man. You'll feel like a sheik, so rich and grand. With dancing girls at your command. Go eat and drink and feast, go east young man."
goin' home,"(Words & music by Byers). This proud wild land where the wind blows free. Has always been a part of me. It's in my blood, I just can't get it out. For a hundred miles a man can see. And be about as wild as he wants to be. If he feels like shouting all he's gotta do is shout. Where the purple mountains reach up high. And look like they're gonna touch the sky. Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years. Where the days are hot, the nights are cold. The desert sand looks just like gold. These trails were carved in sweat and blood and tears. Where the painted desert as you pass by. Looks like a rainbow in the sky. The cactus blooms in the early morning sun. Where the nightwings sing and eagles fly. The clouds paint pictures in the sky. The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done. I'm coming home, this time I'm gonna stay. I'm coming home and I ain't never goin' away. My feet are itching to get back home. I've had the desert fever since I've been gone. I need some loving so bad that I can't see. When a woman looks a man in the eye. You know it takes a man to satisfy. Thinking about them girls is killing me. I'm going home, going home. Going home, I'm going home. Going home, going home."
golden coins,"(Words & music by Giant - Baum - Kaye). Say you're mine, then ask me what you will. All your dreams, my darling I'll fulfill. Golden coins, I will bring to you. Silver trinkets and rubies too. In return dear I'm begging you. For the pleasures of love. I'll bring gifts, like you never saw. Priceless garments that you'll adore. Persian rugs to enhance your floor. For the pleasures of love. Darling, choose anything you please. Rich brocade, or woven tapestries. In exchange, I plead on my knees. For the pleasure of love. Golden coins, I'll place at your feet. Precious jewels to make life complete. All my treasures are yours my sweet."

Never thought that I could miss her so,. Never thought I could, but now I know.. The sound of the old train whistle makes me want to cry,. Reminds me of that lonely feeling when I said goodbye..

"green, green grass of home","(words & music by Claude Putman, Jr.). The old home town looks the same,. As I step down from the train,. And there to meet me is my mama and papa. Down the road I look and there runs Mary. Hair of gold and lips like cherries. It's good to touch the green, green grass of home. Yes, they'll all be there to meet me,. All creatures smiling sweetly. It's good to touch the green, green grass of home. The old house is still standing,. Though the paint is cracked and dry. And there's an old oak tree that I used to play on. Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary. Hair of gold and lips like cherries. It's good to touch the green, green grass of home. Then I awake and look around me. Cold gray walls surround me. And I realize that I was only dreamin'. There's a guard and there's a sad old padre. Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak. Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home. Yes, they'll all be there to meet me. In the shadow of that old oak tree."

I got the same old story at them all night piers,. There ain't no room around here for a guitar man. We don't need a guitar man, son. So I slept in the hobo jungles,. Roamed a thousand miles of track,. Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,. At a club they call Big Jack's,. A little four-piece band was jammin',. So I took my guitar and I sat in,. I showed 'em what a band would sound like,. With a swingin' little guitar man.. Show 'em, son. If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,. Find yourself down around Mobile,. Make it on out to a club called Jack's,. If you got a little time to kill,. Just follow that crowd of people,. You'll wind up out on his dance floor,. Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,. Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,. Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,. Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.."

holly leaves and christmas trees,"Somewhere in, in the distant night. I hear Christmas bells. The gentle snow keeps falling down on people. Who are homeward bound. That's the it's always been. The circle really never ends. Christmas seems to come and go. From the place that I don't know. Holly leaves and Christmas trees. It's that time of year. Lights aglow and mistletoe. Don't mean a thing when you're not here. As I walk, walk this lonely street. The sound of snow beneath my feet. I'll think of how it used to be. Holly leaves and Christmas trees. Use to mean so much to me."

impossible dream (the quest),"(Mitch Leigh/Joe Darion). To dream the impossible dream. To fight the unbeatable foe. To bear with unbearable sorrow. To run where the brave dare not go. To right the unrightable wrong. To love pure and chaste from afar. To try when your arms are too weary. To reach the unreachable star. This is my quest to follow that star. No matter how hopeless, no matter how far. To fight for the right. Without question or pause. To be willing to march. Into hell for a heavenly cause. And I know if I'll only be true. To this glorious quest. That my heart will lie peaceful and calm. When I'm laid to my rest. And the world will be better for this. That one man, scorned and covered with scars. Still strove with his last ounce of courage. To reach the unreachable star. The fight the unbeatable foe. To dream the impossible dream. And the world will be better for this. That one man, scorned and covered with scars. Still strove with his last ounce of courage. To reach the unreachable star. To fight the unbeatable foe. To dream the impossible dream."
in my father's house (are many mansions),"(Arranged and adapted by Elvis Presley). In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not true he would have told me so. He has gone away to live in that bright city. He's preparing me a mansion there I know. Jesus died upon the cross to bear my sorrow. Freely died that souls like you might have new life. But I know that soon there'll come a bright tomorrow. When the world will all be free from sin and strife. (Do not shun the saviors love, from up in glory).

in the garden,I come to the garden alone. While the dew is still on the roses. And the voice I hear falling on my ear. The song of God discloses. And He walks with me. And He talks with me. And He tells me I am his own. And the joy we share as we tarry there. None other has ever known. He speaks and the sound of His voice. Is so sweet the birds hush their singing. And the melody that He gave to me. Within my heart is ringing. And He walks with me. And He talks with me. And He tells me I am his own. And the joy we share as we tarry there

A young man breaks away. He buys a gun, steals a car,. Tries to run, but he don't get far. And his mama cries. As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man.

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,. Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track. Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,. Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,. People passin' by they would stop and say. ""Oh my but that little country boy can play"". (Chorus). His momma told him ""some day you will be a man,. And you will be the leader of a big ol' band. Many people comin' from miles around,. To hear you play your music till the sun go down,. Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin. 'Johnny B. Goode' tonight"". (Chorus)"

Well creatures come from out of sight,. Daylight came from in the night,. and all was good,. Life became a masterplan,. Love produced the perfect man,. that understood,. The image of the makers word,. worshiped him with all he had,. But then one day,. From in the depths an evil seed,. grew and manufactured greed,. That changed the way of life,. Everlasting life,. Oh the loving power looked and saw,. Inside the heart of man a flaw,. began to grow,. Well, the fires of hell began to burn,. and so he sent his chosen son,. To let us know,. That love had surely made us all,. and hate would surely make us fall,. So from the cross,. Well he showed the world that dreadful day,. That love could be the only way,. or all is lost of life,. Everlasting life,. For life is love,. And love is life."

little egypt,"(Words & music by Leiber - Stoller). I went and bought myself a ticket and I sat down in the very first row. They pulled the curtain but then when they turned the spotlight way down low. Little Egypt came out a-struttin' wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow. Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying. She had a ruby on her tummy and a diamond big as Texas on her toe. She let her hair down and she did the hoochie-coochie real slow. When she did her special number on the zebra skin I thought she'd stop the show. Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying. She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground. She winked at the audience and then she turned around. She had a picture of a cowboy tatooed on her spine. Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949.

my little friend,"(Words & music by Shirl Milete). My warped and worried mind resortd. To wandering off to ponder things I never talk about. A pretty girl I used to know but wouldn't know if we met face to face. And defying every logic known. I wish all the time machine could take me back again. To the wonder of my first love, the old folks tease me 'bout. Referring to her only as my little friend. Somewhere far away and maybe not so far away. The child has grown into a woman of the world. I assume just knowing that she knew so much of life at such a tender age. I learned from her the whispered things the big boys at the pool hall talk about. The thrill and disappointment, fear and shame that first love brings. But oh, how I thought I loved my little friend. The fragrance of the green grass mingled with the scent of love and warming earth. The moonlight night I kissed and cried and swore I'd never touch another girl. But time moved fast and I moved on and I loved others time and time again. But with each time I thought of her and always gave a little more. Assembled love and rememberance for my little friend. Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend. Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend."
my way,"And now the end is near. And so I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain. I've lived a life that's full. I've traveled each and every highway. And more, much more than this. I did it my way. Regrets, I've had a few. But then again, too few to mention. I did what I had to do. And saw it through without exemption. I planned each charted course. Each careful step along the byway. Oh, and more, much more than this. I did it my way. Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall. And did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed and cried. I've had my fails, my share of losing. And now as tears subside. I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. Oh, no, no not me. I did it my way. For what is a man, what has he got. If not himself, then he has not. To say the words he truly feels. And not the words from one who kneels. The record shows I took the blows. And did it my way. The record shows I took the blows. And did it my way"
my wish came true,(Words & music by Hunter). My wish came true. When I met you. I've searched and searched. My whole life through. There's just one thing. Dear before we start. Don't say you care. Then break my heart. When you speak of love. Please be sincere. For if you play with love. It can bring tears my dear. My wish came true. To my surprise. When you stood there before my eyes. And when my heart. Started beating fast. T'was then I knew.

never again,"I hope I never ever love anyone this much again. I can't take it anymore, I’ve been hurt before. Never ever quite like this time. What will become of me when you're no longer here. If I can't stop loving you, what am I to do. You'll be free but where will I be. Now that I’m used to love, how can I stand alone. Now that love has come and gone, like the ending of a song. A song my lonely heart keeps singing. Where do I go from here, will I get over you. If so, next time I’ll be smart, I’ll know before I start. A heart that don't care, don't get broken. I hope I never ever love anyone this much again. Never ever, never again. Never again."

old shep,When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup. O'er hills and meadows we'd strayed. Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun. We grew up together that way. I remember the time at the old swimming hole. When I would have drowned beyond doubt. Shep was right there to the rescue he came. He jumped in and helped pull me out. So the years sped along and at last he grew old. His eye sight was fast growing dim. Then one day the doctor looked at me and said. I can't do no more for him Jim. With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun. I aimed it at Shep's faithful head. I just couldn't do it I wanted to run. And I wished they'd shoot me instead. I went to his side and I sat on the ground. He laid his head on my knees. I stroke the best pal that a man ever found. I cried so I scaresly could see. Old Shepy he knew he was going to go. for he reached out and nipped at my hand. He looked up at me just as much as to say. We're parting but you'll understand. Now old Shep is gone where the good doggies go. And no more with old Shep will I roam. But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know. Old Shep has a wonderful home

And I'll soon be gone. Remember the love that we've known. Yes the fair's moving on. But I won't leave you long. It's the last time you'll be on your own. The music has ended, the carousel's still. The horses in boxes with the big Ferris wheel. The canvass and glitter are safely on board. The trailers will soon hit the road. Yes the fair's moving on. And I'll soon be gone. Remember the love that we had. Yes the fair's moving on. But I won't leave you long. I'm coming back so please don't be sad. At dawn I'll be gone but I'll soon return. Till then the fair's moving on. Till then the fair's moving on. Till then the fair's moving on"
the first noel,"The first Noel the angels did sing. Was to certain poor shepherds. In fields as they lay. In fields where they. lay keeping their sheep. On a cold winter's night that was so deep. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the king of Israel. They looked up and saw a star. Shining in the East beyond them far. And to the earth it gave great light. And so it continued both day and night. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the king of Israel. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the king of Israel"

the girl i never loved,"(Words & music by Randy Starr). The girl I never loved. Will never know I cared. And all my dreams of her. Are dreams I'll never share. For I want her and I need her. And I know it might have been. But it ended long before it could begin. The kiss I never got. Somebody else will take. The plans I never made. Somebody else will make. Oh I'm lonely, I'm so lonely. 'Cause it's her I'm thinking of. But she'll always be the girl I never loved."
the girl of my best friend,"The way she walks,. The way she talks. How long can I pretend. Oh I can't help I'm in love. With the girl of my best friend. Her lovely hair,. Her skin so fair.

the impossible dream,"To dream the impossible dream. To fight the unbeatable foe. To bear with unbearable sorrow. To run where the brave dare not go. To right the unrightable wrong. To love pure and chaste from afar. To try when your arms are too weary. To reach the unreachable star. This is my quest, to follow that star. No matter how hopeless,. No matter how far. To fight for the right. Without question or pause. To be willing to march into hell. For a heavenly cause. And I know if I'll only be true. To this glorious quest. That my heart will lie peaceful and calm. When I'm laid to my rest. And the world would be better for this. That one man scorned and covered with scars. Still strove with his last ounce of courage. To reach the unreachable star"
the jaycees speech,"""When I was a child, ladies and gentleman, I was a dreamer.I read comic books,. and I was a hero in the movie.So every dream that I ever dreamed has come true. a hundred times.I learned very early in life that without a song, the day would. never end; without a song, a man ain't got a friend; without a song, the road. would never bend; without a song.So I keep singing a song.Goodnight, Thank."
the lady loves me,"She loves me, she loves me not. She loves me, she loves me not. She loves me, she loves me, she loves me. The lady loves me and it shows. In spite of the way she turns up her nose. I'm her ideal, her hearts desire. Under that ice she's burning like fire. She'd like to cuddle up to me. She's playing hard to get. The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet. The gentleman has savoir-faire. As much as an elephant or a bear. I'd like to take him for a spin. Back to the zoo to visit his kin. He's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette. The lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet. The lady's got a crush on me. The gentleman's crazy obviously. The lady's dying to be kissed. The gentleman needs a psychiatrist. I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake. Or play Russian roulette. The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet. She's falling fast she's on the skids. Both of his heads are flipping their lids. Tonight she'll hold me in her arms. I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs. Will someone tell this Romeo. I'm not his Juliet. The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet. She wants me. Like poison ivy. Needs me. Like a hole in the head. Everyone can see she's got it bad. He's mad!. The gentleman is an egotist. I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist. He's one man I could learn to hate. How's about having dinner at eight. I'd rather dine with Frankenstein. In a moonlight tete-a-tete. The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet. Oh yes she loves me. Dig that shrinking violet. Oh she really loves me. Here's one gal you'll never get. She lo- lo- loves me. Would you like to make a bet. I said the lady loves me. The gentleman's all wet."
the last farewell,"There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor. Tomorrow for old England she sails. Far away from your land of endless sunshine. To my land full of rainy skies and gales. And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow. Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell. For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing. And the taste of war I know so very well. Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising. Their guns on fire as we sail into hell. I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow. But how bitter will be this last farewell. For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. Though death and darkness gather all about me. My ship be torn apart upon the seas. I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands. And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee. And should I return home safe again to England. I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale. For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell."

the meanest girl in town,"(Words & music by J. Byers). She'll tell you that she loves you, make you feel just like a kid. She'll cry to you and lie to you, she'll do 'most anything. She'll get right up next to you and the first thing that you know. You'll be telling her you're sorry because she hurt you so. I said she's evil the most evil girl I've found. There ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town. She'll invite you over to her house at half past nine. You'll wear a suit, you'll wear a tie and you'll give your shoes a shine. You'll take a real deep breath and knock on her front door. Her little sister will tell you ""She don't live here anymore"". I said she's evil the most evil girl I've found. There ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town. And there ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town. She'll put her arms around you and squeeze with all her might. She'll breathe a sigh and pucker her lips and pull your arms real tight. Your heart will pound like thunder, you'll melt in her embrace. But when you go to kiss her well she'll laugh right in your face. Because she's evil the most evil girl I've found."

the sound of your cry,"(Words & music by Giant - Baum - Kaye). The clock by the bed is ticking too loud in the quiet night. I lie in the darkness thinking I must go before it's light.

Though I knew the time was coming and our love would end somehow. I just couldn't bear to tell you exactly just when or how. I know we can't go on, that it was wrong to start. But if you wake up crying now, you know you'll break my heart. Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye. Then I won't hear the sound of your cry. Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye.

And that's a long long time"
the walls have ears,"(Words & music by Bennett - Tepper). The walls have ears, ears that hear each little sound you make. Every time you stamp through a lamp and every cup and dish you break. But they can't hear a kiss or two arms that hold you tight. So come on baby, don't fight tonight. The walls have ears, better think before you fling that shoe. If you part my hair with a chair, they'll spread the news to Timbuktu. But they can't hear a kiss or two arms that hold you tight. So come on baby, don't fight tonight. Jets can fly, fast and high, rockets can go even faster. But they can't catch or even match sound traveling through plaster. The walls have ears, ears that hear each little sound you make. Every time you stamp through a lamp and every cup and dish you break. But they can't hear a kiss or two arms that hold you tight. So come on baby, don't fight tonight. Just in tonight."

That's the Wonder, The Wonder of you"
