helena,"Long ago. Just like the hearse, you die to get in again. We are so far from you. Burning on, just like a match you strike to incinerate. The lives of everyone you know. And what's the worst you take (worst you take). From every heart you break (heart you break). And like a blade you stain (blade you stain). Well, I've been holding on tonight. Chorus:. What's the worst that I can say?. Things are better if I stay. So long and goodnight. So long not goodnight. Came a time. When every star falls. Brought you to tears again. We are the very hurt you sold. And what's the worst you take (worst you take). From every heart you break (heart you break). And like a blade you stain (blade you stain). Well, I've been holding on tonight. Chorus. What's the worst that I can say?. Things are better if I stay. So long and goodnight. So long not goodnight. Well, if you carry on this way. Things are better if I stay. So long and goodnight. So long not goodnight. Can you hear me?. Are you near me?. Can we pretend to leave and then. We'll meet again, when both our cars collide. Chorus. What's the worst that I can say?. Things are better if I stay. So long and goodnight. So long and goodnight. Well, if you carry on this way. Things are better if I stay. So long and goodnight. So long not goodnight"
welcome to the black parade,"When I was a young boy,. My father took me into the city. To see a marching band.. He said, ""Son when you grow up,. would you be the saviour of the broken, The beaten and the damned?"". He said ""Will you defeat them,. your demons, and all the non believers, the plans that they have made?"". Because one day I'll leave you,. A phantom to lead you in the summer,. To join The Black Parade."". When I was a young boy,. My father took me into the city. To see a marching band..

Your memory will carry on. We'll carry on. And in my heart I cant contain it. The anthem wont explain it.. A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams. Your misery and hate will kill us all. So paint it black and take it back. Lets shout it loud and clear. Defiant to the end. We hear the call. To carry on. We'll carry on. And though your dead and gone believe me. Your memory will carry on. We'll carry on. And though you're broken and defeated. Your weary widow marches on. And on we carry through the fears. Ooh oh ohhhh. Disapointed faces of your peers. Ooh oh ohhhh. Take a look at me cause I could not care at all. Do or die. You'll never make me. Because the world, will never take my heart. Go and try, you'll never break me. You want it all, we want to play this part. Won't explain or say I'm sorry. I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar. Give a cheer for all the broken. Listen here, because it's who we are. I'm just a man, I'm not a hero. Just a boy who had to sing this song. Just a man, I'm not a hero. I -- don't -- care. We'll Carry on. We'll carry on. And though your dead and gone believe me. Your memory will carry on. We'll carry on. And though you're broken and defeated. Your weary widow marches on. Do or die. You'll never make me. Because the world, will never take my heart.

i don't love you,"Well when you go. So never think I'll make you try to stay. And maybe when you get back. I'll be off to find another way. And after all this time that you still owe. You're still the good-for-nothing and I don't know. So take your gloves and get out. Better get out. While you can. When you go. Would you even turn to say. I don't love you. Like I did. Yesterday. Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading. So sick and tired of all the needless beating. But baby when they knock you. Down and out. It's where you oughta stay. And after all the blood that you still owe. Another dollar's just another blow. So fix your eyes and get up. Better get up. While you can. When you go. Would you even turn to say. ""I don't love you. Like I did. Yesterday"". (Well c'mon, c'mon!). When you go. Would you have the guts to say. ''I don't love you. Like I loved you. Yester... day, hey, hey, oh. ""I don't love you. Like I loved you yester.... Say, hey, hey"". ""I don't love you. Like I loved you. Yesterday."""

The hardest parts. the awful things that I’ve seen. (Sometimes I see flames. and sometimes I see people. that I love dying. and we...) [x3]. Just sleep [x6]. . (screaming) wake up!...[x5]"
you know what they do to guys like us in prison,"In the middle of a gun fight.... In the center of a restaurant.... They say, ""Come with your arms raised high!"". Well, they're never gonna get me,.

And I don't know. How we're just two men as God had made us,. Well, I can't...well, I can!. Too much, too late, or just not enough of this. Pain in my heart for your dying wish,. I'll kiss your lips again.. They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost,. My cellmate's a killer, they made me do push-ups (in drag). But nobody cares if you're losing yourself...am I losing myself?!. Well, I miss my mom,. Will they give me the chair,. Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare;. Ah, nobody knows...all the trouble I've seen!. Now, but I can't. And I don't know. How we're just two men as God had made us,. Well, I can't...well, I can!. Too much, too late, or just not enough of this. Pain in my heart for your dying wish,. I'll kiss your lips again.. To your room.... What they ask of you. Will make you want to say, ""So long..."". Well, I don't remember,. Why remember...YOU?!. Do you have the keys to the hotel?!. Cause' I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire! (FIRE!!). Life is but a dream for the dead,.

'Cause I really don't care. And I'll do it again. So get me out of my head,. Cause it's getting kind of cramped, you know. Comin' ready or not. When the motor gets hot. We can do it again;.

I'm who I've got to be. These pigs are after me, after you. Run away. Like it was yesterday. And we could run away. If we could run away, run away from here.... And though I know how much you hate this. Are you gonna be the one to save us. From the black and hopeless feeling?. Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?. Hold your heart into this darkness. Will it ever be the light to shine you out. Or fail and leave you stranded. I ain't gonna be the one left standing. You ain't gonna be the one left standing. We ain't gonna be the ones left standing. Gravity. Don't mean to much to me. Is this our destiny?. This world is after me, after you. Run away. Like it was yesterday. And we could run away,. Run away, run away. Run away from here.... Away from here. Away from here."

summertime,"When the lights go out. Will you take me with you. And carry all this broken bones. Through six years down in crowded rooms. And highways I call home. .

Or until your heart explodes, how long?. Until we find our way in the dark and out of harm. You can run away with me. Anytime you want. Terrified of what I'd be. As a kid from what I'd seen. Every single day when people try. And put the pieces back together. Just to smash them down. Turn my headphones up real loud. I don't think I need them now. 'Cause you stopped the noise. Cos' if you stay I would even wait all night. Or until your heart explodes, how long?. Until we find our way in the dark and out of harm. You can run away with me. Anytime you want. Anytime you want. Anytime you want. Don't walk away (x3). Cos' if you stay I would even wait all night. Or until your heart explodes, how long?. Until we find our way in the dark and out of harm.

disenchanted,"Well, I was there on the day. They sold the cause for the queen. And when the lights all went out. We watched our lives on the screen. I hate the ending myself. But it started with an alright scene. It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing. And was a lie when they smiled and said you won't feel a thing. And as we ran from the cops. We laughed so hard it would sting. If I'm so wrong, (so wrong, so wrong). How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long). Now will it matter after I'm gone?. Because you never learned a goddamned thing. You're just a sad song. With nothing to say. About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay. Well, if you think that I'm wrong. This never meant nothing to you. I spent my high school career. Spit on and shoved to agree. So I can watch all my heroes. Sell a car on tv. Bring out the old guillotine. We'll show what we all mean. If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong). How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long). Now will it matter long after I'm gone?. Because you never learned a goddamned thing. You're just a sad song. With nothing to say. About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay. Well if you think that I'm wrong. This never meant nothing to you. So go. Go away. Just go. Run away. But where did you run to?. Where did you hide?. Go find another way. Price you pay. Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah.... You're just a sad song. With nothing to say. About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay. Well if you think that I'm wrong. This never meant nothing to you. C'mon. It's just a sad song. With nothing to say. About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay. Well if you think that I'm wrong. This never meant nothing to you. At all.... At all.... At all.... At all..."
"it's not a fashion statement, it's a fucking deathwish","For what you did to me. And what I'll do to you. You get, what everyone else gets. You get a lifetime. Let's go. Do you remember that day when we met. You told me this gets harder. Well, it did. Been holding on forever. Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll kill my enemies. The damage, you've inflicted temporary wounds. I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me. I'm taking back the life you stole. We never got that far. This helps me to think all through the night. Bright lights that won't kill me now, won't tell me how. Just you and I, your stareless eyes remain. Hip hip hooray for me. You talk to me. But would you kill me in my sleep. Lay still like the dead. From the razor to the rosary. We could lose ourselves. And paint these walls in pitchfork red. I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take. I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me. I'm taking back the life you stole. This hole you put me in. Wasn't deep enough and I'm climbing out right now. You're running out of places to hide from me. When you go, just know that I will remember you. If living was the hardest part. We'll then one day be together. And in the end, we'll fall apart. Just like the leaves change in colors. And then I will be with you. I will be there one last time now. When you go just know that. I will remember you. I lost my fear of falling. I will be with you. I will be with you. . By: Stacy_"

Just to prove that I adore. Every inch of sanity. All I'm asking for is, all I'm asking for is. These hands stained red. From the times that I've killed you and then.

heaven help us,"Hear the sound, the angels come screaming,. Down your voice, I hear you've been bleeding. Make your choice, they say you've been pleading,. Someone save us.. Heaven help us now,.

We'll hear the sound. As you're falling down.. And will you pray for me?. Or make me say don't leave?. And will you lay for me?. Or make us change?. Cause i'll give you all the nails you need,. Cover me in gasoline, wipe away those tears of blood again. And the punchline to the joke is asking,. Someone save us.. Heaven help us now,. Come crashing down,. We'll hear the sound. As you're falling down.. And would you pray for me?. (you don't know a thing about my sins, how the misery begins). Or make us say don't leave?. (you don't know, so I'm burning, I'm burning).

"it's not a fashion statement, it's a fucking deathwish","For what you did to me. And what I'll do to you. You get, what everyone else gets. You get a lifetime. Let's go. Do you remember that day when we met. You told me this gets harder. Well, it did. Been holding on forever. Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll kill my enemies. The damage, you've inflicted temporary wounds. I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me. I'm taking back the life you stole. We never got that far. This helps me to think all through the night. Bright lights that won't kill me now, won't tell me how. Just you and I, your stareless eyes remain. Hip hip hooray for me. You talk to me. But would you kill me in my sleep. Lay still like the dead. From the razor to the rosary. We could lose ourselves. And paint these walls in pitchfork red. I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take. I'm coming back from the dead and I'll take you home with me. I'm taking back the life you stole. This hole you put me in. Wasn't deep enough and I'm climbing out right now. You're running out of places to hide from me. When you go, just know that I will remember you. If living was the hardest part. We'll then one day be together. And in the end, we'll fall apart. Just like the leaves change in colors. And then I will be with you. I will be there one last time now. When you go just know that. I will remember you. I lost my fear of falling. I will be with you. I will be with you. . By: Stacy_"

Then I'd be another memory. Can I be the only hope for you?. Because you're the only hope for me. And if we can't find where we belong. We'll have to make it on our own. Face all the pain and take it on. Because the only hope for me is you alone. How would you be. Many years after the disasters. That we've seen. What if we learned. Of all the people burning. In purifying flame. I'll say it's okay. I know you can tell. And though you can see me smile. I still think of the guns they sell. If there's a place that I could be. Then I'd be another memory. Can I be the only hope for you?. Because you're the only hope for me. And if we can't find where we belong. We'll have to make it on our own. Face all the pain and take it on.

the sharpest lives,"Well it rains and it pours when you're out on your. own.. If I crash on the couch can I sleep in my clothes?. Cause I've spent the night dancing, I'm drunk I. suppose.. If it looks like I'm laughing I'm really just asking. to leave.. This alone. You're in time for the show,. You're the one that I need, I'm the one that you. loathe.. You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose,. Cause I love all the poison, away with the boys in. the. band.. I've really been on a bender and it shows,. So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?. Give me a shot to remember,. And you can take all the pain away from me.. A kiss and I will surrender,. The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.. A light to burn all the empires,. So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be. In love with all these vampires. So you can leave like the sane abandoned me.. There's a place in the dark where the animals go,. You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow.. Juliet loves the beat ant the lust it commands. Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands.. Romeo.. I've really been on a bender and it shows,. So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?. Give me a shot to remember,. And you can take all the pain away from me.. A kiss and I will surrender,. The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.. A light to burn all the empires,. So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be. In love with all these vampires. So you can leave like the sane abandoned me.. Ow!. Give me a shot to remember,. And you can take all the pain away from me.. A kiss and I will surrender,. The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.. A light to burn all the empires,. So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be. In love with all these vampires. So you can leave like the sane abandoned me.. Ooooow, whooa [4x]"
the world is ugly,"These are the eyes, and the lives and the taken. These are their hearts. But their hearts don't beat like ours. They burn cause they're all are afraid. For everyone of us, there's an army of them. But you'll never fight alone. Cause I wanted you to know. That the world is ugly. But you're beautiful to me. Well, are you thinking of me now?. These are the nights and the lights that we've faded. These are the words but the words aren't coming up. They burn cause they are hard to say. For every failing sun. There's a morning after. Though I'm empty when you go. I just wanted you to know. That the world is ugly. But you're beautiful to me. Are you thinking of me,. Like I'm thinking of you?. I would say I'm sorry though. Though I really need to go. I just wanted you to know. I wanted you to know. I wanted you to know. I think of you every night, every day. These are the lies and the lives of the taken. These are the hearts. But their hearts don't beat like ours. They burn, cause they are all afraid. When mine beat twice as hard. Cause the world is ugly. But you're beautiful to me. Are you thinking of me. Like I'm thinking of you. I would say I'm sorry though. Though I really need to go. I just want you to know. That the world is ugly. But you're beautiful to me. Are you thinking of me?. Stop your crying, helpless feeling. Dry your eyes and start believin'. There's one thing they'll never take from you. (One day, like this, we'll never be the same. Never forever. Like ghost in the snow. Like ghost in the sun)"
this is how i disappear,To un-explain the unforgivable. Drain all the blood & give the kids a show. By streetlight. This dark night. A seance down the below. There's things that I have done. You never. Should ever know.. And without you is how I disappear. And live my life alone. Forever now. And without you is how I disappear. And live my life alone. Forever now. Who walks among the famous living dead. Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed. And if you could talk to me. Tell me if it's so. That all the good girls go. To heaven. Well heaven knows. That without you is how I disappear. And live my life alone. Forever now. And without you is how I disappear. And live my life alone. Forever now.. Can you hear me cry out to you?. Words I thought I'd choke on. Figure out. I'm really not so with you anymore. I'm just a ghost.. So I can't hurt you anymore. So I can't hurt you anymore. And now. You wanna see how far down. I can sink?. Let me go!. So - you can - well now so - you can. I'm so far away from you. Well now so - you can.. And without you this is how I disappear. And without you this is how I disappear. Forever. Forever now.
this is the best day ever,"And we can run, from the backdrop of these gears and scalpels. At every hour goes the tick-tock bang of monitors as. They stared us down when me in the emergency room. And in our beds, I could hear you breathe with help from. cold machines. Every hour, on the hour, they drew blood. Well I felt I couldn't take, another day inside this place. From silent dreams we never wake, and in this. promise that we'll make. Starless eyes for heaven's sake, but I hear you anyway. Well I thought I heard you. Say I like you, we can get out. We don't have to stay, stay inside this place. Someday, this day, we kept falling down. Someday, this day, set the ferris wheel ablaze. You left my heart an open wound. And I love you for. This day, someday we kept falling down. One day, this day all we had to keep us safe. And if we never sleep again, it would never end. Well I thought I heard you say to me. We'll go so far, far as we can. And I just can't stay, one day we'll run away"
this song is a curse,"All alone now, nothing feels right. Just find ways to cope with feelings. That you don't understand. Because no one really cares how you feel. Just as long as you act how everyone else expects you to act. My friends, we can do anything with science. Except say goodbye. But I'm trying to hold on to anything. And not mess up everything. Everyone hates me, I hate all of you. I tried to adjust, but I'm young and screwed up. How do you expect me to believe. When you were my age you didn't. My friends, we can do anything with science. Except maybe die. But I'm trying to hold on to everything. And not mess up everything, everything, everything. Why does right and wrong seem so far away?. But if I had my way. But if I had my way we would all be sorry. My friends, we can do anything. But should we?. If things end up so... blah, blah, blah. I'm trying to hold on to what I love. And not mess up everything. I mess up everything. No one cares anyway"
to the end,"He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb.. He's always choking from the stench and the fume.. The wedding party all collapsed in the room.. So send my resignation to the bride and the groom.. Let's go down!. This elevator only goes up to ten.. He's not around.. He's always looking at men. Down by the pool.. He doesn't have many friends.. As they are. Face down and bloated snap a shot with the lens.. If you marry me,. Would you bury me?. Would you carry me to the end?. So say goodbye to the vows you take. And say goodbye to the life you make. And say goodbye to the heart you break. And all the cyanide you drank.. She keeps a picture of the body she lends.. Got nasty blisters from the money she spends.. She's got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz. She drives at 90 by the Barbies and Kens.. If you ever say never too late.. I'll forget all the diamonds you ate.. Lost in coma and covered in cake.. Increase the medication.. Share the vows at the wake.. (Kiss the bride). If you marry me,. Would you bury me?. Would you carry me to the end?. So say goodbye to the vows you take. And say goodbye to the life you make. And say goodbye to the heart you break. And all the cyanide you drank.. And say goodbye to the last parade. And walk away from the choice you made. And say goodbye to the hearts you break. And all the cyanide you drank.. So say goodbye to the vows you take. And say goodbye to the life you make. And say goodbye to the hearts you break. And all the cyanide you drank.. So say goodbye to the last parade. And walk away from the choice you made. And say goodnight to the hearts you break. And all the cyanide you drank.. To the last parade. When the parties fade. And the choice you made. To the End."
tomorrow's money,"Fell in love with a vampire. You wanna get it for free. Then say hello to the brush fire, baby. You gotta take it from me. I'm gonna take it from you. Say hello to the good times. And say hello to the sun. They're sitting back on an empire. While the world lays back. Puts a kid behind that gun. If we crash this time. They got machines to keep us alive. When the mix tape plays. Choke down the words with no meaning. I stopped bleeding three years ago. While you keep screaming for revolution. Me and my surgeons and my street walking friends. We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead. Yeah!. Say hello to the program. We're gonna give it for free. Hook up the veins the antibodies. Got it with the disease. We're gonna give it to you. Say goodbye to the good times. You're loading up with the fame. You're dressing up like a virus. But the words get lost when we all look the same. If we crash this time. They got machines to keep us alive. When the mix tape plays. Choke down the words with no meaning. I stopped bleeding three years ago. While you keep screaming for revolution. Me and my surgeons and my street walking friends. We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead. Fell in love with a vampire. Tops off? to the empire. Say hello to the brush fire. The microphone's got a tap wire. Fell in love with a vampire. Tops off? to the empire. Say hello to the brush fire. The microphone's got a tap wire. Yeah, if we crash this time. They got machines to keep us alive. While the army wives. Choke down the war with no meaning. I stopped bleeding three years ago. While you keep screaming for revolution. Because rebellion ain't a t-shirt you sell. You keep your money and I'll see you in hell"
under pressure (cover),Pressure pushing down on me. Pressing down on you. No man ask for. Under pressure -. That burns a building down. Splits a family in two. Puts people on streets. That's ok. It's the terror of knowing. What the world is about. Watching some good friends screaming. 'let me out'. Pray tomorrow - gets me higher. Pressure on people -. People on streets. O.k.. Chippin' around. Kick my brains around the floor. These are the days it never rains but it pours. People on streets. People on streets. It's the terror of knowing. What this world is about. Watching some good friends. Screaming 'let me out'. Pray tomorrow - gets me higher high high. Pressure on people - people on streets. Turned away from it all like a blind man. Sat on a fence but it don't work. Keep coming up with love. But it's so slashed and torn. Why - why - why ?. Love love love love love. Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking. Can't we give ourselves one more chance. Why can't we give love that one more chance. Why can't we give love give love give love give love. Give love give love give love give love give love. 'cause love's such an old fashioned word. And love dares you to care for. The people on the edge of the night. And loves dares you to change our way of. Caring about ourselves. This is our last dance. This is our last dance. This is ourselves. Under pressure. Under pressure. Pressure

vampires will never hurt you,"And if they get me and the sun goes down into the ground. And if they get me take this spike to my heart and. And if they get me and the sun goes down. And if they get me take this spike and. You put the spike in my heart. And if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones. And then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks I saw you there. Someone get me to the doctor, someone get me to a church. Where they can pump this venom gaping hole. And you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat. And if they come and get me. You put the spike in my heart. And if they get me and the sun goes down. And if they get me take this spike and. [Chorus]. Can you take this spike?. Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless. Night time sky. Can you take this spike?. Will it wash away this jet black feeling?. And now the nightclub set the stage for this they come in pairs she said. We'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey they're always there. Someone get me to the doctor, and someone call the nurse. And someone buy me roses, and someone burned the church. We're hanging out with corpses, we're driving in this hearse. Someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul. [Chorus]. And as these days watch over time, and as these days watch over time. And as these days watch over us tonight. [x2]. I'll never let them, I'll never let them. I'll never let them hurt you now tonight. I'll never let them, I can't forget them. I'll never let them hurt you, I promise. Struck down, before our prime.

Fatality is like ghosts in snow and you have no idea what you're up against. because I've seen what they look like.. Becoming perfect as if they were sterling silver chainsaws going cascading...)"
we don't need another song about california,"Give up the giving shot. Dedication, to the places that you never need to hide. Occupations, the opportunity to see yourself in lights. And all the city fires. And the tabloid lies. And the television guys. For the missions and the boulevards. And the way it is when money's all you got. Stop and stare. At the accidents and stars that bore you. We don't dare, sing another song for, California. Anywhere. Where the city lights are hopeless for you. We don't care, I need another song for, California. Shut up and give me a shot. On occasion, to the places that you never want to die. On the station, everybody hears but no one needs to try. On the telephone, on the methane dare. Every minute that you scream. For the errant scars and the dying stars. Every second that you take to fake your life. Stop and stare. At the accidents and stars that bore you. We don't dare, sing another song for, California. Anywhere. Where the city lights are hopeless for you. We don't care, I need another song for, California. Stop and stare.

welcome to the black parade,"When I was a young boy,. My father took me into the city. To see a marching band.. He said, ""Son when you grow up,. would you be the saviour of the broken, The beaten and the damned?"".

Your memory will carry on. We'll carry on. And though you're broken and defeated. Your weary widow marches on. And on we carry through the fears. Ooh oh ohhhh. Disapointed faces of your peers.
