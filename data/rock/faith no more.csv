epic,"Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?. If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway. You will never understand it cuz it happens too fast. And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass. It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright. It's so groovy, it's outta sight. You can touch it, smell it, taste it so sweet. But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet. You want it all but you can't have it. It's cryin', bleedin', lying on the floor. So you lay down on it and you do it some more. You've got to share it, so you dare it. Then you bare it and you tear it. You want it all but you can't have it. It's in your face but you can't grab it. It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin. It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win. It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain. It's sad it happened and it's a shame. You want it all but you can't have it. It's in your face but you can't grab it. What is it?. It's it. What is it?...."
falling to pieces,"Back and forth, I sway with the wind. Resolution slips away again. Right through my fingers, back into my heart. Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark. Sometimes I think I'm blind. Or I may be just paralyzed. Because the plot thickens every day. And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away. But I know, there's a picture beneath. Indecision clouds my vision. No one listens.... Because I'm somewhere in between. My love and my agony. You see, I'm somewhere in between. My life is falling to pieces. Somebody put me together. Layin' face down on the ground. My fingers in my ears to block the sound. My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight. Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight. Droplets of ""yes"" and ""no"". In an ocean of ""maybe"". From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline. From the top, another downhill slope of mine. But I know, the equilibrium's there. Indecision clouds my vision. No one listens. Because I'm somewhere in between. My love and my agony. You see, I'm somewhere in between. My life is falling to pieces. Somebody put me together."
edge of the world,"Come here, my love. I'll tell you a secret. Come closer, now. I want you to believe it. I'll tell you all the things. You want to hear. Don't worry, baby. There's nothing to fear. Hey, little girl. Would you like some candy?. Look into my eyes. I've seen it all. Hand in hand. Together we fall. We'll sing and dance. And we'll find romance. And we'll stroll to the edge of the world. Come sit right down. Lay your head on my shoulder. It's not the point. That I'm forty years older. You can trust me. I'm no criminal. But I'd kill my mother. To be with you. We'll sing and dance. And we'll find romance. And we'll stroll to the edge of the world. Give me a smile. Let me see those pearlies. I'll do anything. For the little girlies...."
a small victory,"A hierarchy. Spread out on the nightstand. The spirit of team. Salvation is another chance. A sore loser. Yelling with my mouth shut. A cracking portrait. The fondling of trophies.

Got a taste of evidence. I didn't feel a thing. It didn't mean a thing. Look in the eye and testify. I didn't feel a thing. I didn't feel a thing. It didn't mean a thing. Look in the eye and testify.

from out of nowhere,"Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm. You splash me with beauty and pull me down. Cause you come from out of nowhere. My glance turns to a stare. Obsession rules me-I'm yours from the start. I know you see me-Our eyes interlock. Cause you come from out of nowhere. My glance turns to a stare. One minute here and one minute there. Don't know if I'll laugh or cry. One minute here and one minute there. And then you wave good-bye.... Sifting to the bottom, every day for two. All energy funnels, all becomes you. Cause you come from out of nowhere. My glance turns to a stare. One minute here and one minute there. Don't know if I'll laugh or cry. One minute here and one minute there. And it hurts inside. One minute here and one minute there. And then you wave good-bye...."
midlife crisis,"Verse 1:. Go on and wring my neck. Like when a rag gets wet. A little discipline. For my pet genius. My head is like a lettuce. Go on and dig your thumbs in. I cannot stop giving. I'm thirty-something. Bridge:. Sense of security. Like pockets jingling. Midlife crisis. Suck ingenuity. Down through the family tree. Hook:. You're perfect, yes, it's true. But without me you're only you (only you). Your menstruating heart. It ain't bleeding enough for two. It's a midlife crisis.. It's a midlife crisis... Verse 2:. What an inheritance. The salt and the kleenex. Morbid self attention. Bending my pinky back. A little discipline. A donor by habit. A little discipline. Rent an opinion. Bridge 2:. Sense of security. Holding blunt instrument. Midlife Crisis. I'm a perfectionist. And perfect is a skinned knee. Hook:. You're perfect, yes, it's true. But without me you're only you. Your menstruating heart.

the real thing,"I know the feeling. It is the real thing. The essence of the truth. The perfect moment. That golden moment. I know you feel it too. I know the feeling. It is the real thing. You can't refuse the embrace.... It's like the pattern below the skin. You gotta reach out and pull it all in. And you feel like you're too close. So you swallow another dose. The pinnacle of happiness. Filling up your soul. You don't think you can take any more. You never wanna let go. To touch the roots of experience. The most basic ingredients. To see the unseen glitter of life. And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife. Cherish the certainly of now. It kills you a bit at a time. Cradle the inspiration. It will leave you writhing on the floor.... This is so unreal, what I feel. This nourishment, life is bent. Into a shape I can hold. A twist of fate, all my own. Just grit your teeth, make no sound. Take a step away and look around. Just clench your fist and close your eyes. Look deep inside, hypnotize. The whisper is but a shout. That's what it is all about. Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray. You will never let it slip away. Like the sacred song that someone sings through you. Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into. Like the dream you know one day will come to life. Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger. It's the jewel of victory. The chasm of misery. And once you have bitten the core. You will always know the flavor. The split second of divinity. You drink up the sky. All of heaven is in your arms. You know the reason why. It's right there, all by itself. And what you are, there is nothing else. You're growing a life within a life. The lips of wonder kiss you inside. And when it's over the feeling remains. It all comes down to this. The smoke clears, I see what it is. That made me feel this way.... This is so unreal, what I feel. Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood. Pump through your veins, can't explain. The element that's everything. Just clench your fist and close your eyes. Look deep inside, hypnotize. Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray. You will never let it slip away. Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after. Like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance, in silence. Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying. Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending...."

Is this my blood dried upon my face?. Or is it the love of someone else?. It tastes so sweet, just like you used to. So rescue me my love, splice us together. I remember loving you so much. But where are you and where's your fatal touch?. When I closed my eyes, was it my siesta?. Did I encounter a darkness stronger than sleep?. I am thirsty for my sleep"

Your time has come, around again my sleepless one. Your friend was young, hung and plastered. He never knew his own disaster. I think it's good, in fact it was faster. Cause it was you that he was after. Hold me now, as if you'll never let me go. Unhand me now, as if you've always known my name. His love was king, his love was master. He needed more, he needed always. He searched in vein for love and shelter. In every soul, in every hallway. So you thought she'd be sweeter than your girlfriend Peter. Well give it a second chance cause you've yet to meet her. We got the same ideas, we got the same old fears. They're different colors sometimes, but, hey, who cares?. Just years that tears our lives apart. Just like the time that you tried to teach your cousin to walk. He couldn't do it-push!-you told him twice. Well, I do man but it just don't jive. Tried so hard to control my behavior. I tried so hard, so hard to believe you. But now I live only to deceive you...."

falling to pieces,"Back and forth, I sway with the wind. Resolution slips away again. Right through my fingers, back into my heart. Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark. Sometimes I think I'm blind. Or I may be just paralyzed. Because the plot thickens every day. And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away. But I know, there's a picture beneath. Indecision clouds my vision. No one listens.... Because I'm somewhere in between. My love and my agony. You see, I'm somewhere in between. My life is falling to pieces. Somebody put me together. Layin' face down on the ground. My fingers in my ears to block the sound. My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight. Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight. Droplets of ""yes"" and ""no"". In an ocean of ""maybe"". From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline. From the top, another downhill slope of mine. But I know, the equilibrium's there. Indecision clouds my vision. No one listens. Because I'm somewhere in between. My love and my agony. You see, I'm somewhere in between. My life is falling to pieces. Somebody put me together."

The truth is that our youth was a carpet laid with stones. Get the mother fucker on the phone (repeat). Hello Motherfucker. My lover. You had it coming"

His name was Johnnie. Wait a minute, that's me. Why am I only three years old again. Spinning and spinning and spinning. There was no gleam in your eye. When you passed us by. In the parade this time. You had nothing to say. And you're always on your way somewhere. But today you just stood still. You were a quiet kind of person. Who asked for nothing and got just that. So they sent you away to kill for your country. Could you blame him?. Could you blame them?. No. And in the end. When we meet again we're friends. Will we ever learn that we are always God's children. And gods never made moral decisions. They made love."

So you paint one on, it's the art of imitation.. It tickles you to death, knowing you can play the game so well.. But you can't ignore, don't know who you are, so what.. . Your sugar coated, guns are loaded,. Afraid of tasting yourself.. So you keep lying, never trying,. Say your somebody else. . The bitterness inside your heart,. It shows through in your eyes,. And you can't win in the end.. . You take your big guns, loading them with your fatal charm.. The fact is, you love me, nothing can kill me now.. I've learned the power of deceit, the power of the sweet, is so true.. Now I'm a confection to taste good is all I must do.. . Your sugar coated, guns are loaded,. Afraid of tasting yourself.. So you keep lying, never trying,. Say your somebody else. . Its too easy to get to where you,. Take it, dig it, every day. And you can't win in the end.. The bitterness inside your heart,. It shows through in your eyes,."
take this bottle,"I can wait to love in heaven. I can wait for you. Far away, I'll treat you better. Better than down here. Cuz I done wrong. And I'm a little afraid. I ain't to strong. And this ain't easy to say:. Take this bottle. Take this bottle. And just walk away-the both of you. And let me feel the pain-I've done to you. I can hope we'll be together. With a better roof over our heads. I can hope the stormy weather. It passes on-it passes on-. But I've hoped too long. Hoped for me to change. That hope is gone. So listen to what I say:."

the cowboy song,"Tears fall, they scarred your innocent dreams. Loves fall, they kinda leave your empty. Leaves fall, the seasons pass your by. And you think that maybe you can fly. Ceilings fall, which each romance your incur. Clouds fall, which each moment of despair. Buildings fall, the pavement is their bed. But what's the last thing that goes through your head ?. You take the elevator to the top. The next thing you know. There you are standing on the edge. And all the flashing lights and futile cries. they left with you now. Just close your eyes and take the final step. Rains fall, they dampen your will to live. Gods fall, which each pleasure your give. You fall, and take the whole world with you. But will you even bother to look down ?. You take the elevator to the top. The next thing you know. There you are standing on the edge. The circumstance it turns you inside out. So we can have peace.

the crab song,"""And after all the feelings go, I see I still love you so,. I just thought I'd let you know now that everything's okay,. And you are on your way back, back to where you came,"". She said with pain in her heart, it was there from the start.. Now I know why everything turns grey, but it's our own world we paint. And I want the brightest, I want flourescence every day and night. For the rest of my life, open your eyes, won't you?. Can't you see you're so beautiful to me?. Don't look back as a matter of fact there's. A ten foot Jack wants to break your back. You stole his girl, you wrecked his world. Now it's your your head that he's gonna twirl. He won't think once, he won't think twice. Cause he knows just what he's gonna do tonight. He will commit a crime, a crime of love. And he won't be happy till he sees your blood. Looking back on when you left me. Standing in the rain. Don't look back as a matter of fact there's. A son of a bitch and he's digging a ditch. For you my friend, my lucky one.

Looking back on when I left you.... Crying in pain. Don't look back...[1st verse]. Looking back on when you left me. Standing in the rain, in-credible pain. I understand.

the jungle,"Well, just follow your heart. Man oh man. Try and see, if you can. Ha Ha. Jungle sounds great. Lots of scary noise. Don't deter us from our journey onward. Hey man, let your spirit go. To the full extent of the meaning. He said, ""And follow me to the deepest part of the jungle. Where it is always dark and wet and warm. To the sacred part."". Well, just follow your heart.

the last to know,Where it grows on trees. But never blooms. Where it hurts the least for whoever. Saw it first. First to go and the last to know. Lasts longer than a lifetime. Takes the least amount of effort. Feels better than a bargain. Just to know it's there So I don't have to see the light. Can't you see. There's only one me. And that me is me. I know where but I cannot share. You'll call me-I'll stand in line till then. I'll be waiting. Can't you see. All circuits are busy.
the morning after,"Awakened by the sun light. Victimized by last night. Memories flashin' through my head. Was I just born or am I dead?. Yesterday's forgotten, the morning after. I can taste you, I can hear your laughter. Fading in the distance. Recollections drifting. Bloodstains on my tattered clothes. Each minute the fear grows. If I could just lay down to rest. I'm tired of searching for myself. If I am dead, how can I feel such love?. If I am dead, why am I dreaming?. If I am dead, where do I go from here?. If I am dead, why does this pain feel so good?. Is this my blood dried upon my face?. Or is it the love of someone else?. It tastes so sweet, just like you used to. So rescue me my love, splice us together. I remember loving you so much. But where are you and where's your fatal touch?. When I closed my eyes, was it my siesta?. Did I encounter a darkness stronger than sleep?. I am thirsty for my sleep"
the perfect crime,"Girl listens to mom. So she lights a match and pretends to sleep. While everything burns. Man drives nowhere. So he pressed the pedal, hit a few dogs. And felt good. Boy hears teacher's words. So he closed his eyes and stepped in front. of a train. Woo!. Woops!. Sorry 'bout that. It's just an accident. Revenge. Nobody forgets. Chop it into bits. The bitterness is hard to hide. It smells like homicide. Just nod and say it's O.K.. I can hear your voice echo. O.K. I lied-it's really the voice. Of the guy who kicked your head in. Look in the mirror. It seems you're drinking, miniature. And soon enough your gone. Woops!. Sorry 'bout that. It's just an accident. Revenge. Nobody forgets. Chop it into bits. The bitterness is hard to hide. It smells like homicide. Just nod and say it's O.K.. No one saw the perfect crime. I can't wait for the next time. The bitterness is hard to hide. It smells like homicide. Just nod and say it's O.K.. You try to make the moment. Last you sold it right in half. You die and have a nice day. Woops!. Sorry 'bout that. It's just an accident."
the real thing,"I know the feeling. It is the real thing. The essence of the truth. The perfect moment. That golden moment. I know you feel it too. I know the feeling. It is the real thing. You can't refuse the embrace.... It's like the pattern below the skin. You gotta reach out and pull it all in. And you feel like you're too close. So you swallow another dose. The pinnacle of happiness. Filling up your soul. You don't think you can take any more. You never wanna let go. To touch the roots of experience. The most basic ingredients. To see the unseen glitter of life. And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife. Cherish the certainly of now. It kills you a bit at a time. Cradle the inspiration. It will leave you writhing on the floor.... This is so unreal, what I feel. This nourishment, life is bent. Into a shape I can hold. A twist of fate, all my own. Just grit your teeth, make no sound. Take a step away and look around. Just clench your fist and close your eyes. Look deep inside, hypnotize. The whisper is but a shout. That's what it is all about. Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray. You will never let it slip away. Like the sacred song that someone sings through you. Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into. Like the dream you know one day will come to life. Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger. It's the jewel of victory. The chasm of misery. And once you have bitten the core. You will always know the flavor. The split second of divinity. You drink up the sky. All of heaven is in your arms. You know the reason why. It's right there, all by itself. And what you are, there is nothing else. You're growing a life within a life. The lips of wonder kiss you inside. And when it's over the feeling remains. It all comes down to this. The smoke clears, I see what it is. That made me feel this way.... This is so unreal, what I feel. Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood. Pump through your veins, can't explain. The element that's everything. Just clench your fist and close your eyes. Look deep inside, hypnotize. Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray. You will never let it slip away. Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after. Like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance, in silence. Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying. Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending...."
the world is yours,"Keep your distance. You're in the race. Caress me. In your eye I've got better things to do This will hurt someone White walls, windows. Charity. defenders. Comfort me and bring me something sharp This will hurt someone - someone else. This will hurt someone else Calm down, Think Carefully. Seen it all before. Mind your own fucking business. Seen it all before. What I would give for your eyes. Seen it all before. You'd never blink again. Seen it all before Faces on top of more faces. This bullet in your chest, the world is yours. Each word, you suck it through a straw. It's so predictable, it's policy This will hurt someone - someone else"
this guy is in love with you,"You see this guy. This guy's in love with you. Yes, I'm in love. Who looks at you the way I do. When you smile I can tell. We know each other very well. How can I show you I'm glad. I got to know you, 'cause:. I've heard some talk. They say you think I'm fine. Yes, I'm in love. And what I'd do to make you mine,. Tell me now, is it so?. Don't let me be the last to know.. My hands are shaking. Don't let my heart keep breaking, 'cause. I need your love. I want your love. Say you're in love. In love with this guy,. If not I'll just die."
ugly in the morning,"You did one thing wrong. You woke up.. It looked better before. More-more. And the stomach turns.... Say nothing without wasting a word. I know exactly what you meant. I know how piggy feels. He starves without missing a meal. Look in the mirror.... Don't look at me-. I'm ugly in the morning. When the headache is gone,. The sun is not.. Forgot to turn the alarm. On-on. Doesn't matter how much you think. Or the number of hairs in the sink. I did it to myself again. I know how piggy feels. He starves without missing a meal. It's getting clearer.... Don't look at me-."
underwater love,"Looking down into the water. It's hard to make out your face. If our love is drowning, then why. Do I feel so out of place?. Bubbling up to the surface. Are you getting a breath of fresh air?. Forever longing to make you mine. But I can't escape your stare.... Liquid seeps into your lungs. But your eyes look so serene. It's wonderful how the surface ripples. But you're perfect, and I cannot breathe. Forever longing to make you mine. But I can't escape your stare.... Hold me closer, keep me near. My underwater love. Hold me closer, keep me near. I'll never get enough. Touch me from below. I'll never let you go."
war pigs,"Generals gathered in their masses. Just like witches at black masses. Evil minds that plot destruction. Sorcerers of death's construction. In the fields are bodies burning. As the war machine keeps turning. Death and hatred to mankind. Poisoning their brainwashed minds, Oh Lord yeah. Politicians hide themselves away. They only started the war. Why should they go out to fight. They leave that all to the poor. Time will tell on their power minds. Making war just for fun. Treating people just like pawns in chess. Wait til the judgement day comes. Now in darkness world stops turning. Asher where the bodies burning. No more warpigs have the power. And as God has struck the hour. Day of judgement, God is calling. On their knees the warpigs crawling. Begging mercy for their sins. Satan laughing spreads his wings. Oh lord, yeah"

what a day,"A piece of mail. A letter head. A piece of hair. From a human head. They're sayin' to me. ""I should've killed it"". ""I should've killed it"". ""I should've killed it before"". You're right, you're right. ""Kill the body and the head will die"". They're laughin' at me. ""I should've learned it"". ""I should've learned it"". ""I should've learned it before"". -What a day, what a day. If you can look it in the face. And hold your vomit. A wet sneeze and a ""no left turn"". A row of teeth and an encouraging word. Beneath a mile of skin. ""I should've noticed it"". ""I should've noticed it"". ""I should've noticed it before"". What a day. What a day. What a day."
why do you bother,"Why hold on?. Your hands are getting sore. You must be scared of something. From the time before, well.... We're here again. How long, who knows?. It's not your right to tell me.

I see you hold on tighter..... But just fatigue. Is all your face will show. It's weary from the stress. Getting delirious. ""I didn't want this race. We can""t keep up this pace"". We don't want to get well. We want to go to hell. We want an urban dream. The fucking urban scream. ""This time was mine to borrow. I'll pay for it tomorrow"". You'll pay for it today.
