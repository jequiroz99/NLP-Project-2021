leave me alone,"Sometimes I'm scared. Sometimes I'm chained to the ground. But I'll not give up, I'll find a way to reach the crown. Sometimes I go but it's too difficult to see. To find a way I will have to believe. Cause I try, and I try. But I know there's gonna be a place for me. Why can't you leave me alone?. Doing the things on my own. You keep me running around. The things that just put me down. But this time I know I won't be drowning, no. I'm gonna say it out loud: I am done with you. So you think you can beat me?. Let me tell you something. Your words can't hurt me. and your hate can't touch me now. I'm leaving all of this behind. I used to hide from the dreams inside. But now I'm moving on, I'm finding my way. Why can't you leave me alone?. Doing the things on my own. You keep me running around. The things that just put me down. But this time I know I won't be drowning, no. I'm gonna say it out loud: I am done with you. Why can't you leave me alone?. Doing the things on my own. Why can't you leave me alone?. Doing the things on my own. You keep me running around. The things that just put me down. But this time I know I won't be drowning, no. I'm gonna say it out loud: I am done with you"
