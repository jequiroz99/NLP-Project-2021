society,"Oh, it's a mystery to me. We have a greed with which we have agreed. And you think you have to want more than you need. Until you have it all you won't be free. Society, you're a crazy breed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... When you want more than you have. You think you need.... And when you think more than you want. Your thoughts begin to bleed. I think I need to find a bigger place. Because when you have more than you think. You need more space. Society, you're a crazy breed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... Society, crazy indeed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... There's those thinking, more is less, less is more. But if less is more, how you keeping score?. Means for every point you make, your level drops. Kinda like you're starting from the top. You can't do that.... Society, you're a crazy breed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... Society, crazy indeed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... Society, have mercy on me. Hope you're not angry if I disagree.... Society, crazy indeed. Hope you're not lonely without me..."
hard sun,When I walk beside her. I am the better man. When I look to leave her. I always stagger back again. Once I built an ivory tower. So I could worship from above. When I climb down to be set free. She took me in again. There's a big. A big hard sun. Beating on the big people. In the big hard world. When she comes to greet me. She is mercy at my feet. When I see her pin her charm. She just throws it back at me. Once I dug an early grave. To find a better land. She just smiled and laughed at me. And took her blues back again. There's a big. A big hard sun. Beating on the big people. In the big hard world. When I go to cross that river. She is comfort by my side. When I try to understand. She just opens up her hands. There's a big. A big hard sun. Beating on the big people. In the big hard world. Once I stood to lose her. When I saw what I had done. Bowed down and threw away the hours. Of her garden and her sun. So I tried to want her. I turned to see her weep. Forty days and forty nights. And it's still coming down on me. There's a big. A big hard sun. Beating on the big people. In the big hard world
rise,Such is the way of the world. You can never know. Just where to put all your faith. And how will it grow. Gonna rise up. Bringing black holes and dark memories. Gonna rise up. Turning mistakes into gold. Such is the passage of time. Too fast to fold. And suddenly swallowed by signs. lo and behold. Gonna rise up. Find my direction magnetically. Gonna rise up. Throw down my ace in the hole

Circles they grow and they swallow people whole. Half their lives. they say goodnight to wives they'll never know. A mind full of questions,. and a teacher in my soul. And so it goes.... Don't come closer or I'll have to go. Holding me like gravity are places that pull. If ever there was someone to keep me at home. It would be you.... Everyone I come across, in cages they bought. They think of me and my wandering,. but I'm never what they thought. I've got my indignation,. but I'm pure in all my thoughts. I'm alive.... Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere. Underneath my being is a road that disappeared. Late at night I hear the trees,. they're singing with the dead. Overhead.... Leave it to me as I find a way to be. Consider me a satellite, forever orbiting. I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me. Guaranteed."
no ceiling,"Comes the morning. When I can feel. That there's nothing left to be concealed. Moving on a scene surreal. No, my heart will never, will never be far from here. Sure as I am breathing.

I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh. I leave here believing more than I had. This love has got no ceiling"
tonight you belong to me,"(feat. Cat Power). I know you belong. To somebody new. But tonight you belong to me. Although we're apart. You are a part of my heart. But tonight you belong to me.

But tonight you belong to me"

My shadow comes with me as we leave it all. We leave it all far behind. On empty pocket's wealth. Love will create a sense of wealth. Why contain yourself like any other book on a shelf. My shadow lays with me. Underneath the big white sun. My shadow stays with me as we leave it all. We leave it all far behind. Subtle voices in the wind,. And the truth they're telling. The world begins where the road ends. Watch me leave it all behind. Far behind..."

[Chorus]. Now it's gone, gone. And I am who I am. Who I was I will never be again. Running out of sand. I stare at my reflection to the bone. Blurred eyes look back at me. Full of blame and sympathy. So, so close. Right roads not taken, the future's forsaken. Dropped like a fossil or stone. [Chorus]. Now it's gone, gone. And I am who I am. Who I was I will never come again. Running out of sand. A drunk octopus wants to fight. Fearful of dreams, there'll be no sleep tonight. Fine at dinner, dead by dessert. Victim or witness, we're gonna get hurt. A fragile existence with echoes of wrath. I can't stop the bleeding nor the tears from thine eye. There's another us around somewhere with much better lives. With God as our witness but he won't testify. [Chorus]. Oh now it's gone, gone. And I am who I am. Who I was I'll never have the chance. Running out of sand. Running out of sand. Running out of sand"
sleeping by myself,"I should have known there was someone else. Down below I always kept it to myself. Now I believe in nothing. Not today as I move myself out of your sight. I'll be sleeping by myself tonight. I could never go to no one else. The hurt don't show but who knows, time will tell. I believe in nothing. But the pain that I can't see this turning out right. Oh I'll be sleeping by myself tonight. Forever be sad and lonely. Forever never be the same. Well I close my eyes and wait for a sign. Am I just waiting in vain?. Wooah I believe in love and disaster. Sometimes the two are just the same. I'm beginning to see what's left of me. Is gonna have to be free to survive. And I'll be sleeping by myself. I'll be sleeping by myself. I'll be sleeping by myself tonight"
long nights,Have no fear. For when I'm alone. I'll be better off than I was before. I've got this life. I'll be around to grow. Who I was before. I cannot recall. Long nights allow me to feel....

I'll forever know. I've got this light. And the will to show. I will always be better than before. Long nights allow me to feel.... I'm falling...I am falling. The lights go out. Let me feel. I'm falling. I am falling safely to the ground. Ah...

I can't stop the bleeding nor the tears from thine eye. There's another us around somewhere with much better lives. With God as our witness but he won't testify. [Chorus]. Oh now it's gone, gone. And I am who I am. Who I was I'll never have the chance. Running out of sand. Running out of sand. Running out of sand"
rise,Such is the way of the world. You can never know. Just where to put all your faith. And how will it grow. Gonna rise up. Bringing black holes and dark memories. Gonna rise up. Turning mistakes into gold. Such is the passage of time. Too fast to fold. And suddenly swallowed by signs. lo and behold. Gonna rise up. Find my direction magnetically. Gonna rise up. Throw down my ace in the hole
satellite,"It's no shame that. Love's a game that. I can only play with you. What I'm saying. Is I'm here waiting. For you. I've seen the light, I'm. Satisfied that. The brightest star is you. Satellite, I'm. Holding tight. Beaming back to you. Days turn into. Nights turn into. Days turn into today. Don't think I'm out playing. Cause I'm inside waiting. For you. I've felt the light, I'm. Satisfied that. The highest high is you. Satellite, I'm. Holding tight. Beaming back to you. Don't you worry. I believe your story. You were put away. For something you didn't do. What I'm saying. Is I'm saving. My love"
setting forth,"Being, no concern. Point of no return. Go forward in reverse. This I will recall. Yeah, every time I fall. Keep setting forth in the universe. Keep setting forth in the universe. Out here realigned. A planet out of sight. On nature drunk and high. Keep.... Keep.... Ohhhhhh..."
skipping,"Didn't have to ask you, just took my hand. Off we went skipping throughout the land. The sky was blue and the blood filled my head. Me and you skipping throughout the land. All of my life from beginning to end. What I remember is holding your hand. And all that I'll cherish is that time that we've spent. Me and you skipping throughout the land. All the loves lost and the one that I found. You lifted my gaze up off of the ground. Forever we'll talk and forever we'll drown. In each other skipping around. Gravity pulls so many men down. The atmosphere breathes but not in this town. You took me away and you held me so proud. Skipping, skipping around. And all the king's horses and all the king's men. Could not keep me from holding your hand. When all that I wanted was something to protect. And all that I needed was your voice in my head. And all I remember from this life that I lived. Is me and you skipping throughout the land"
sleeping by myself,"I should have known there was someone else. Down below I always kept it to myself. Now I believe in nothing. Not today as I move myself out of your sight. I'll be sleeping by myself tonight. I could never go to no one else. The hurt don't show but who knows, time will tell. I believe in nothing. But the pain that I can't see this turning out right. Oh I'll be sleeping by myself tonight. Forever be sad and lonely. Forever never be the same. Well I close my eyes and wait for a sign. Am I just waiting in vain?. Wooah I believe in love and disaster. Sometimes the two are just the same. I'm beginning to see what's left of me. Is gonna have to be free to survive. And I'll be sleeping by myself. I'll be sleeping by myself. I'll be sleeping by myself tonight"
sleepless nights,"Through the sleepless nights. I cry for you. And wonder who. Is kissing you. These sleepless nights. Will break my heart in two. Somehow, through the days. I don't give in. I hide the tears. That wait within. But than through sleepless nights. I cry again. Why did you go?. Why did you go?. Don't you know, don't you know. I need you?. I keep hoping you'll. Come back to me. Oh let it be,. Please let it be. My love, please end these. Sleepless nights for me. Why did you go?. Why did you go?. Don't you know, don't you know. I need you?. I keep hoping you'll. Come back to me. Oh let it be,. Please let it be. My love, please end these. Sleepless nights for me. My love, please end these. Sleepless nights for me"
society,"Oh, it's a mystery to me. We have a greed with which we have agreed. And you think you have to want more than you need. Until you have it all you won't be free. Society, you're a crazy breed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... When you want more than you have. You think you need.... And when you think more than you want. Your thoughts begin to bleed. I think I need to find a bigger place. Because when you have more than you think. You need more space. Society, you're a crazy breed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... Society, crazy indeed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... There's those thinking, more is less, less is more. But if less is more, how you keeping score?. Means for every point you make, your level drops. Kinda like you're starting from the top. You can't do that.... Society, you're a crazy breed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... Society, crazy indeed. Hope you're not lonely without me.... Society, have mercy on me. Hope you're not angry if I disagree.... Society, crazy indeed. Hope you're not lonely without me..."
the long road (feat. nusrat fateh ali khan),"And I wished for so long, cannot stay.... All the precious moments, cannot stay.... It's not like wings have fallen, cannot stay.... But I feel something's missing, cannot say.... Holding hands are daughters and sons. And their faiths just falling down, down, down, down.... I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today. We all walk the long road. Cannot stay.... There's no need to say goodbye.... All the friends and family. All the memories going round, round, round, round. I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today. And the wind keeps roaring. And the sky keeps turning gray. And the sun is set. The sun will rise another day.... We all walk the long road. Cannot stay.... There's no need to say goodbye.... All the friends and family. All the memories going round, round, round, round. I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today. How I've wished for so long. How I wish for you today. We all walk the long road. We all walk the long road. We all walk the long road"
tonight you belong to me,"(feat. Cat Power). I know you belong. To somebody new. But tonight you belong to me. Although we're apart. You are a part of my heart. But tonight you belong to me. Wait down by the street. How sweet it will seem. Once more just to dream in. The moonlight, my honey i know. With the dawn that you will be gone. But tonight you belong to me. But tonight you belong to me"
without you,"I'll grow when you grow. Let me loosen up the blindfold. I'll fly when you cry. Lift us out of this landslide. Wherever you go, whenever we part. I'll keep on healing all the scars. That we've collected from the start. I'd rather this than live without you. For every wish upon a star. That goes unanswered in the dark. There is a dream I've dreamt about you. And from afar I lie awake. I close my eyes to find I wouldn't be the same. I'll shine when you shine. Painted pictures on a my mind. Sunsets on this ocean. Never once on my devotion. However you are or far that you fall. I'll keep on healing all the scars. That we've collected from the start. I rather this than live without you. For every wish upon a star. That goes unanswered in the dark. There is a dream I've dreamt about you. And from afar I lie awake. Close my eyes to find. I'd never be the same. Without you. Without you"
you're true,"Lonely cliffs and waterfalls. If no one sees me, i'm not here at all. You could be the one to liberate me From the sun. So please, give the moon to me. I'd be indebted to ya. Walk the dog and pay rent to ya. If you say the word, I'm yours. Oh sure.... Nothing ever goes my way. But with you here, that all will change. Suddenly I'm a new born child. And I'm ready to live a while with you. So much left to do. And so I thank you dearly. For letting me see clearly. Open up, she said. You're true, be you. I'm at home in my own skin. I'm like an ocean's tide come in. Yes you could be the one to hold my hand. beneath the full moon. You could be the one. You're true, you're true. You're true, you're true. You're true..."
you've got hide your love away,"Here I stand head in hand. Turn my face to the wall. If she's gone I can't go on. Feelin' two-foot small. Everywhere people stare. Each and every day. I can see them laugh at me. And I hear them say. Hey you've got to hide your love away. Hey you've got to hide your love away. How could I even try. I can never win. Hearing them, seeing them. In the state I'm in. How could she say to me. Love will find a way. Gather round all you clowns. Let me hear you say. Hey you've got to hide your love away"
