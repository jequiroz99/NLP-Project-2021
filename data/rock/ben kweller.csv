i miss you,"I miss you, I think about you every day. I wonder who you're laughin' with right now. I wish you'd let me say what I need to say. Been tryin' for weeks to track you down.. The rain pours on this painted concrete runway. As another show takes me to the sky. I wish I could fly this plane to you. Even just to say goodbye. It doesn't matter anyway. You have changed. You have changed. [x2]. I miss you, I think about your summer smile. So shocked how easy it is for you to escape closure. Yeah, you just run away, wonder if that weight'll catch up to you. You're too old to act like such a child. With a head all business and a heart unfree. Me, I still miss you, you don't even care and that's what's scarin' me. It doesn't matter anyway. You have changed. You have changed. [x2]"
in other words,Another night slips away. In other words i should say. There are no words he should say. There are no words. In his eyes I see the fear. That only time could DISAPPEAR. If only time could reappear. Now's the time. Somethinâ€™ to take it away to take it away to take it. Donâ€™t let it stay donâ€™t let it stay donâ€™t let it. The butterflys are passive aggresive and put their problems on the shelf but theyâ€™re beautiful. Heâ€™ll realize the only thing thats real are the kids that kid themselves and the demise of the beautiful. What is beautiful?. The multi-life is better than. The one weâ€™re in the one we knew. Cause everyone is seeinâ€™ through everyone. Theyâ€™re steppinâ€™ on. His gold terrain. Heâ€™s movinâ€™ on with bold refrain. His blatently old campaign. Is movinâ€™ on. Somethinâ€™ to take it away to take it away to take it. Donâ€™t let it stay donâ€™t let it stay donâ€™t let it. The butterflys are passive aggresive and put their problems on the shelf but theyâ€™re beautiful. Heâ€™ll realize the only thing thats real are the kids that kid themselves and the demise of the beautiful. What is beautiful?. What canâ€™t stay goes away. It starts stopping when it stops stopping.

i miss you,"I miss you, I think about you every day. I wonder who you're laughin' with right now. I wish you'd let me say what I need to say. Been tryin' for weeks to track you down.. The rain pours on this painted concrete runway. As another show takes me to the sky. I wish I could fly this plane to you. Even just to say goodbye. It doesn't matter anyway. You have changed. You have changed. [x2]. I miss you, I think about your summer smile. So shocked how easy it is for you to escape closure. Yeah, you just run away, wonder if that weight'll catch up to you. You're too old to act like such a child. With a head all business and a heart unfree. Me, I still miss you, you don't even care and that's what's scarin' me. It doesn't matter anyway. You have changed. You have changed. [x2]"
i need you back,"Take me back when you think that it¹s good.. It feels worse than they said it would.. You¹re gone but not forever.. When I know that I¹m never wanted. I tuck away in my turtle shell.. I¹ve standed on this hex forever.. I need you back, I need you here,. to take away all of my pain and then my fear.. Hey! I need you back.. Like a ghost on his darkest visit,. you got my soul, now baby why is it. gone gone gone? Take it from me.. You are free if you can sleep at night,. you really must be hard if you¹re feeling alright.. Hey hey hey, we¹re way uptown, we gotta turn around.. I need you back, I need you here,. to take away all of my pain and then my fear.. Hey! I need you back.. I need you back, I need you here,. to take away all of my pain and then my fear.. Hey! I need you back.. (I¹m so lost without you.)"
in other words,Another night slips away. In other words i should say. There are no words he should say. There are no words. In his eyes I see the fear. That only time could DISAPPEAR. If only time could reappear. Now's the time. Somethinâ€™ to take it away to take it away to take it. Donâ€™t let it stay donâ€™t let it stay donâ€™t let it. The butterflys are passive aggresive and put their problems on the shelf but theyâ€™re beautiful. Heâ€™ll realize the only thing thats real are the kids that kid themselves and the demise of the beautiful. What is beautiful?. The multi-life is better than. The one weâ€™re in the one we knew. Cause everyone is seeinâ€™ through everyone. Theyâ€™re steppinâ€™ on. His gold terrain. Heâ€™s movinâ€™ on with bold refrain. His blatently old campaign. Is movinâ€™ on. Somethinâ€™ to take it away to take it away to take it. Donâ€™t let it stay donâ€™t let it stay donâ€™t let it. The butterflys are passive aggresive and put their problems on the shelf but theyâ€™re beautiful. Heâ€™ll realize the only thing thats real are the kids that kid themselves and the demise of the beautiful. What is beautiful?. What canâ€™t stay goes away. It starts stopping when it stops stopping.

Everyone I've been is wonderin' where I've been. And askin' why I didn't write when I was in jail. It's hard to be yourself when everyone is someone else.

Starry skied countryside, magnetic feet on the city street. Oh, it's so hard. Oh, it's so hard. Ask yourself, “who am I?”. Even angels cry sometimes to sanctify. Oh, it's so hard. Justify me. I'm down on my knees. Please, please, please let it go. Please, please, please let it go. Please, please, please let it go. Oh, it's so hard"

Aw, mom, I always dreamt of being a good listener. so tonight I¹m on my way.. There¹s this kid you gotta meet. He lives across the street.. He¹s got spirit and heart. We¹re ten years apart.. He is up for anything. He can hang with anyone.. He still likes the things we used to think were fun.. Aw, mom, I never thought that I could have a friend. but tonight I¹m on my way.. I¹m in love with someone who¹s as pretty as a flower.. Her life gives me power so I¹m buyin¹ her a ring.. She makes hats with her hands. She is such an artist.

the rainbow,"Why do I sing these songs. All of these mixtures of pain?. About a girl with too many wrongs. Finding the words to complain. I often picture her voice. When she is nowhere to be heard. I try to make the pleasing choice. And I try to say the pleasing words. Still I can't figure out why I act this way. The storm is all around, everyday. Oh, where's the rainbow?. Oh, where's the rainbow?. How is your best friend today?. All of the goals you never met?. What will your boss say. When it is time to quit, but never forget?. Still I can't figure out why I act this way. The storm is all around, everyday. Oh, where's the rainbow?. Oh, where's the rainbow?. Still I can't figure out why I act this way. Just tryin' to live my life day by, day by day. Oh, where's the rainbow?. Oh, where's the rainbow?. Where's the rainbow?. Where's the rainbow?. Where's the rainbow?. Where's the rainbow?"

thirteen,Thirteen. . . We've been in the rain. We've been on the mountain. We've been round the fire. In fancy hotels. Drank water from farm wells. We sang with the choir. I kissed your dry lips. We jumped off the high cliffs. And splashed down below. Skin to skin. In the salty river. Made love in the shadow. Woooah ooh. Read books to each other. Read the mind of the other. Flew one thousand (jets?). We laughed and we cried. At movies and real life. In our ridiculous beds. We danced in the moonlight at midnight. We pressed against back doors and wooden floors. And you never faked it. And frequently. We ignored our love. But we could never mistake it. Oooh ooh. We met on the front porch. Fell in love on the phone. Without the physical wreck. You gave me the necklace. That used to hang. Around your mothers neck. We questioned religions. Fed bread to the pigeons. We learned how to pray. We stood by the ocean. Turned our hearts in to one. We laid in bed all day. Heeey. We skipped on the sidewalk. Skipped stones on the water. We skipped town. We've seen the sunrise with new eyes. We've seen the damage of gossip and true lies. We've seen the sun go down. Had passionate makeouts. And passionate freakouts. We built this world of our own. It was in the back of a taxi. When you told me you loved me
this is war,I'm a soldier on a battlefield. Got an army on the battlefield. Outnumbered like the Alamo. I don't even want to go. This is war. Yeah yeah yeah. This is war. Always stuck in a daydream. Can't focus on the other team. Hunted you all day and night. Now I'm ready for a fight. This is war. Yeah yeah yeah. This is war. I can't be your friend. Cuz I got to knock you out. Are you ready for a surprise?. I don't even think you even realize. They say that you're the best. You gotta follow all the rest. This is war. Yeah yeah yeah. This is war. I can't be your friend. Cuz I gotta knock you out. So I can win.
time will save the day,"I don't care where I sleep tonight. I don't care if I'll be alright. A problem's a wave. You gotta ride to the other side and wave bye-bye-bye. I jumped through the clouds, I rode with the hale. I sat in a field, I walked with the snail. I saw through the eye that made up the storm. It held me in hands that kept me warm-warm-warm. Time will save the day. Time will save the day. Time will save the day. Don't go away, yeah, yeah, yeah!. I went through the fortress, I slept with the mistress. I read through the bible, it gave me revival. Down in the city, the prison of beauty. The kingdom of waitin' for nothin' to feel like me. I wish you were born just a little bit greener. But I could have sworn you were a believer. That head full of wisdom had nowhere to go. So it just melted away like snow-snow-snow. Time will save the day. Time will save the day. Time will save the day. Don't go away, yeah, yeah, yeah!. Time will save the day..."

wicked little town,"with the Bens (Hedwig and angry inch tribute). . Forgive me for I did not know. 'cause I was just a boy. And you were so much more. Than any god could ever plan. More than a woman or a man. And now I understand. How much I took from you. That when everything starts breaking down. You take the pieces off the ground. And show this wicked town. Something beautiful and new. You think that luck has left you there. But maybe there's nothing. Up in the sky but air. And there's no mystical design. No cosmic lover preassigned. There's nothing you can find. That cannot be found. 'cause, with all the changes you've been through. It seems the stranger's always you. Alone again in some new. Wicked little town. So when you've got no other choice. You know you can follow my voice. Through the dark turns and noise. Of this wicked little town. Oh, it's a wicked little town. Goodbye wicked little town"

You can count on me. You can count on me. When you're locked up and need to be set free. You can count on me. I've seen great people slip away right before my eyes. They're not here today. You should know that I won't disappear on you. No more barricades or walls of emotional stone. No more dead-end streets that you walk down alone. You can count on me. You can count on me. When you're locked up and need to be set free. You can count on me. When you're lost and you need new eyes to see. You can count on me. I'll help you follow through on all of your dreams. You can count on me"
