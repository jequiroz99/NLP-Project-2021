Till the sun comes out again. Future past and present past. Sometime the misty lane. Like a garden grow. Today I'll never know. Joy assist hers Poisoness. Goodbye I must go. Chorus (x2). You're the one for me.

There's a white carnation growing. In a garden overgrown. There's a factory that's empty. No one works there anymore. Down the street of broken families. Dreams are in the trash. A father begs forgiveness. But it's much too late for that. Autumn in paradise. Invisible all your life. Autumn in paradise. Who can afford the price?. If you ask me what I'm thinking. I won't tell you how I feel. I'm moving like a target. I've got nothing left to steal. There was something when you came here. There'll be nothing when you leave. A soul lacks all direction. When there's nothing to believe. Autumn in paradise. Invisible all your life. Autumn in paradise. Who can afford the price?"

treasure trip,"Your desires. That were realized the day. That you exchanged. The very core of yourself away. Till nothing more remained. Of your past life. As all of the friends around you. Fell one by one. As you made your way up the stairway. Everything you wanted to. Came true for you and your endeavor. Till it all came home to you. That it could never last forever. It's too late. Because yesterday has vanished. For all of time. But today and tomorrow. Welcome you and your decline. What a shame, who's to blame. For your state of being. Where are the friend you once had. Now you really need them. Chorus."
trippin' on your love,"I'm trippin' on your love. I'm trippin' on your love. Sweet stone soul seduction. Surrender to the one. Open like a flower. Arms raised to the sun. I'm trippin' on your love. I'm trippin' on your love. Trippin' on your love. Bond so strong between us. Bridge between our souls. Lifts me like a bird of prey. Heals the wounded boy. I'm trippin' on your love. I'm trippin' on your love. I'm trippin' on your love. I'm trippin' on your love. Stare into the void too long. It stares back into you. I was a damaged, diseased, hollow man. 'Til I plugged into you. I'm trippin' on your love. I'm trippin' on your love. I'm trippin' on your love. I'm trippin' on your love"
understanding - pp & the primes (pp arnold and primal scream),"When people ask me what love's all about. There's one thing I can say. Some people believe just what I'm putting down. Understand your troubles away. Chorus. You got to do this thing we're feeling. You got to know just what I'm meaning. You gotta believe just what I'm handing. Understanding, understanding. Yeah, alright alright. Hey hey. You see I love this life I lead. And I wanna love it with you. But people you don't understand. Just what I'm putting down. There's no more I can do. Chorus. You got to do this thing we're feeling. You got to know just what I'm meaning. You gotta believe just what I'm handing. Understanding, understanding. Yeah, alright, come on. Just don't lose it. Come on children, I wanna hear you one more time. Chorus. You got to do this thing we're feeling. You got to know just what I'm meaning. You gotta believe just what I'm handing. Understanding, understanding. You know what I'm singing about. My baby's gonna care, gonna make it alright. With a little understanding. We can make it through the night, yeah. Baby, baby give me some. You know I got to have some. All you know we need is just a little understanding. You can talk to me baby. Tell me what's on your mind. With a little understanding. Everything will be just fine"

velocity girl,"Here she comes again. With vodka in her veins. Been playing with a spike. She couldn't get it right. Splendour in silver dress. Velocity possessed. The world was hers again.

The promises we make whenever. Everything's possible. I think we should try. I wish I were with you tonight. With you tonight. With you tonight. With you tonight. You are my everything. You are my everything. You are my everything. You are my everything. You are my everything. I can't do anything. You are my everything. You are the sun and sky. You are the reason why.

when the blackout meets the fallout,"Fear eats the head. Fear eats the soul. Launder the corpses. Program the fall. Disposable face. Use once and destroy. Years of denial. Mirror of lies. Marriage in gridlock. Libido on ice. Sex, zero zero. Slums of romance. Got what you wanted. Lost what you had. Deal with the devil. The blues is a woman. When the blackout meets the fallout. When the blackout meets the fallout. When the blackout meets the fallout. When the blackout meets the fallout. Art of conspiracy. Cloning yourself. Soul of corruption. Erotic despair. Criminal sadness. Familial pain. The price of existence. Again and again. When the blackout meets the fallout. When the blackout meets the fallout. When the blackout meets the fallout.

when the bomb drops,We've had a lot of good times brother. I've knows you all my life. Mixing blood and drugs and women. In your journey to the endless night. I've watched you kill the love you're given. You sold your vision for a glimpse of heaven. Once you were a thief of fire. Now you're just a junkie liar. What you gonna cop. When the bomb drops?. There's been a million people brother. Just like you before. Think you're beyond good and eveil. You can't even find the door. Painting pictures on your wall. In junkie blood. Hey man! Ain't that cool?. It's so beautiful!. Once you were a thief of fire. Now you're just a junkie liar. What you gonna cop. When the bomb drops?. Ain't no medicine to cure you. Ain't no woman you can love. Only death can make you painless. Only death can make you come. Junkie Jesus on the cross. You beg for scraps like a mongrel dog. Once you were a thief of fire. Now you're just a junkie liar. What you gonna cop. When the bomb drops?
where the light gets in (feat. sky ferreira),"Broken light's the only light I know. How to make it through this world alone. Love has become strange and then estranged. Ended there, but there it starts again. Obsession, position. Ecstatic, deception. Trick and defiance. Bounds of desire. It's your sin, peace begins within. (I'm never gonna try again). It's your sin, peace begins within. (The world is a place where the light gets in). Said you'll let emotion burn away. Stare into the darkness of the day. Images are not like memories. Lovers take the plunder, then they leave. Obsession, position. Temptation, transgression. We're second, we're active. The script is pre-destined. The show of sin. It's your sin, peace begins within. (I'm never gonna try again). It's your sin, peace begins within. (The world is a place where the light gets in). It's your sin, peace begins within. (I'm never gonna try again). It's your sin, peace begins within. (The world is a place where the light gets in). It's your sin, peace begins within. (I'm never gonna try again). It's your sin, peace begins within. (The world is a place where the light gets in). The world is a place where the light gets in (x4)"
you're just dead skin to me,"Everyday is a better day without you. I got so strung out I lost myself all tangled up in you. Sweet lover, sister, friend, you were my everything. I dreamed a dream of you but it wasn't true. It wasn't true no, no. I don't care now you are dead skin to me. I don't care now you are dead skin to me. Your pretty face hides a darker place I got damaged. When my soul was sick you pushed I tripped. I hurtso hard I hurt. Addicted to you I was weak you stole my mind. It's a twisted world you're a twisted girl. Your curse don't hurt no more. I don't care now you are dead skin to me (2x)."
you're just too dark to care,"Morning comes. All your friends are dead or gone. You sit there staring at the wall. You tripped you took a long hard fall. You can't sleep, you're cold. You're numb you're wasted, you feel beat. You get burned. You hurt like hell you'll never learn. You'll just do what you always do. When people wash their hands of you. Lose yourself in alcohol and any drugs you find. Nobody can help you when you're this far down. Nobody can help you when you're this far down. Nobody can help you nobody can help you. Nobody can help you when you're this far down. No one but you. Nobody but you. Nobody but you. Nobody but you."
