smoke on the water,"We all came out to Montreaux. On the Lake Geneva shoreline. To make records with a mobile. We didn't have much time. Frank Zappa and the Mothers. Were at the best place around. But some stupid with a flare gun. Burned the place to the ground. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water. They burned down the gambling house. It died with an awful sound. Funky Claude was running in and out. Pulling kids out the ground. When it all was over. We had to find another place. But Swiss time was running out. It seemed that we would lose the race. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water. We ended up at the Grand Hotel. It was empty, cold and bare. But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside. Making our music there. With a few red lights and a few old beds. We made a place to sweat. No matter what we get out of this. I know, I know we'll never forget. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water"
perfect strangers,"Can you remember remember my name. As I flow through your life. A thousand oceans I have flown. And cold, cold spirits of ice. All my life. I am the echo of your past. I am returning the echo of a point in time. Distant faces shine. A thousand warriors I have known. And laughing as the spirits appear. All your life. Shadows of another day. And if you hear me talking on the wind. You've got to understand. We must remain. Perfect Strangers. I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow. A strand of silver hanging through the sky. Touching more than you see. The voice of ages in your mind. Is aching with the dead of the night. Precious life your tears are lost in falling rain. And if you hear me talking on the wind. You've got to understand. We must remain. Perfect Strangers"

soldier of fortune,"I have often told you stories about the way. I lived the life of a drifter waiting for the day. When I'd take your hand and sing you songs. And may be you would say. Come lay with me and love me. And I would surely stay. But I feel I'm growing older. And the songs that I have sung. Echo in the distance. Like the sound. Of a windmill going round. Guess I'll always be. A soldier of fortune. Many times I've been a traveller. I looked for something new. In days of old when nights were cold. I wandered without you. Those days I thought my eyes. Had seen you standing near. Though blindness is confusing. It shows that you're not here. Now I feel I'm growing older. And the songs that I have sung. Echo in the distance. Like the sound. Of a windmill going round. Guess I'll always be. A soldier of fortune. Yes, I can hear the sound. Of a windmill going round. I guess I'll always be. A soldier of fortune. I guess I'll always be.

Yet again. I'm missing you. King size bed. (in a) hotel someplace. I hear your name. I see your face. I see your face. (the) back street dolls. And the side door johnnies. The wide eyed boys with their bags full of. Money. Back in the alley. Going bang to the wall. Tied to the tail. Of a midnight crawl. Heaven wouldn't be. So high I know. If the times gone by. Hadn't been so low. The best laid plans. Come apart at the seams. And shatter all my dreams. Sometimes I feel like.... Screaming. Close my eyes. It's times like this. My head goes down. And the only thing I know. Is the name of this town. Is the name of this town. Yet again. I'm missing you. Won't be long. I'm coming home. Until that distant time. I'll be moving on. I'll be moving on

haunted,I hear the beating of your wings. As if you're playing on my strings. In mysterious ways. You draw me in. To a love. Beyond all understanting. Beyond my reach. So far away. But it seems. Like only yesterday. I'm haunted. Haunted. Is that what you wanted. All that's left. Is the ghost of your smile. It stays awhile. Then fades away. I hear your footsteps on the ground. Tempting me to turn around. It's just the echo. Of a disenchanted lover. Shuffling aimlessly. Homeward bound. To empty rooms. And picture frames. And friends. Who can't recall our names. I'm haunted. Haunted. Is that what you wanted. All that's left. Is the ghost of your smile. It stays a while. And fades away
knocking at your back door,Sweet Lucy was a dancer. But none of us would chance her. Because she was a Samurai. She made electric shadows. Beyond our fingertips. And none of us could reach that high. She came on like a teaser. I had to touch and please her. Enjoy a little paradise. The log was in my pocket. When Lucy met the Rockett. And she never knew the reason why. I can't deny it. With that smile on her face. It's not the kill. It's the thrill of the chase. Feel it coming. It's knocking at the door. You know it's no good running. It's not against the law. The point of no return. And now you know the score. And now you're learning. What's knockin' at your back door. Sweet Nancy was so fancy. To get into her pantry. Had to be the aristocracy. The members that she toyed with. At her city club. Were something in diplomacy. So we put her on the hit list. Of a common cunning linguist. A master of many tongues. And now she eases gently. From her Austin to her Bentley. Suddenly she feels so young
maybe i'm a leo,"Peeping round the door I got a big surprise. Couldn't see a thing but open skies. They've taken her away where is she now. Wish that she was here wish she'd hold my hand.

time for bedlam,"""Descending the cold steps of the institution. For the politically insane. Never to be seen again. Saying farewell to daylight. From henceforth I shall rot. In a stinking bed of wet straw"". Right from the ashes of life. I learned to behave. What to believe. What not to say. From cradle to grave. Ah... Like a good little slave. Sucking my milk. From the venomous tit of the State. Clearly designed to suppress. Every thought of escape. Ah... I surrender to fate. No pity no pity. Don't want no pity for me. In this filthy cell. I see you in hell. Frozen in time. I'm a specimen pinned to my throne. With an army of butterflies. Pilloried placid and prone. Ah... We were never alone. No pity no pity. Don't no pity for me. In this filthy cell. I see you in hell. ""After centuries of living. With nothing but my convictions. Broken fingers clawing through. The walls of my incarceration. Escaping the clutches of eternal damnation. I was justified"""
all the time in the world,"There's still a long way to go. And the nights are closing in. But if I'd travelled any faster, babe. Lord knows where I might have been. Right from those early days. I put my faith in the axle, not the wheels. Like old Zeno's toytus. With Achilles snapping at my heels. Don't worry. There's no hurry. Here we are. With all the time in the world. I could have been a high-flying dealer. But I have no desire for speed. I could have been a wide receiver. But I've got everything I need. And so I watch the world go racing by. Tearing up the street. I lay back in the long grass. Take it easy, (and) rest my feet. Don't worry. You know there's no hurry. Here we are. With all the time in the world. No-one ever held me back. You know that no-one ever put me in chains. No-one ever saw me racing ahead. No-one had to tug on my reins. As everybody knows, I may be slow. But I never quit. Sometimes, on a good day, I sit and think. Sometimes, I just sit. Don't worry. Relax, there's no hurry. Here we are. With all the time in the world. Don't worry. You know there's no hurry. Here we are. With all the time in the world"
money talks,"I was young and healthy. Extremely wealthy. I swung in the trees. And did as I pleased. I thought I was rich. Oh yeah. Such sweet seduction. I could feel the suction. Greasing my palm. And doing no harm. Just making some deals. What a bitch. Money talks to me. Whispers in my ear. Gives me everything I want. Everything I want. I had rising stock. So I got more pockets. I knew somewhere to stick it. Where no-one would nick it. I kinda went private. And then, aha. Such sweet seclusion. No more intrusion. Too much food on my plate. But there's guards at the gate. Such joy. I could almost die of it. Money talks to me. Lays it on the line. Gives me everything I want. Everything I want. Money goes to money. Yes it always returns. Finds its way back to the big house. Where it lives all alone. Wraithlike silent partners. Operators of the system. Give words of quiet assurance. To an otherwise healthy victim. It's all coming back to me. I would swing in the trees. And I'd swim in the ocean. I used to show some emotion. I was not to blame. I feel no shame. The structure was shaking. Was there for the taking. I had the resources. But then, oh no. Someone outbid me. I can't take it with me?. Then I will devour it. I can't go without it. It's simply a question of. Market forces. Money talks to me. Whispers in my ear. Gives me everything I want. Everything I want. Money talks to me. Laughs right in my face. Gives me everything I want. Everything I want"

A twist in the tale. Face in the mirror head in the clouds. Hanging on to a dream that you can't do without. As it drops like a stone without trace. Give what you want take what you need. Squeezing so hard there's no room to breathe. And your flavour has fallen from grace. That's alright there's a change in the story. That's alright there's a change in the plan. A twist in the tale. I saw you dancing. Dancing on air. You were lost in the in the starlight. No one but me really cared. Every question turns out a lie. Can't you swallow the truth for once in your life. I loved you but don't ask me why. It's alright there's a change in the story. It's alright there's a change in the plan. A twist in the tale.
above and beyond,(Verse). Light turn the candle. I spark one for me. Let it float on the water. Right down to the sea. You draw back your curtain. A wavy goodbye. Lift up your arms. And look up to the sky. To the sky!. (Verse). Stop me a candle. And keep it in the light. Thought it pairing window. And I come back tonight. You touch me in the darkness. I send you a sign. A give me your loving. And I'll give you mine. (Chorus). I'm maybe leaving. But I won't be gone. I'll be there when you want me. Above and beyond. (Verse). You're fading like I tell you. It's all up to you. I'll be there if you'll need me. If I get it through. Reached on your settlers. And tomorrow you'll find. Your souls had been touched. Are forever entwined. (Chorus). I'm maybe leaving. But I won't be gone. I'll be there when you want me. Above and beyond. (Chorus 2). Yes I'm maybe leaving. But not for too long. I'll be there when you want me. Above and beyond
all i got is you,"Yeah I see the way you roll your eyes. The way your purse your lips. Throw your stuff into a suitcase. Put your hands upon your hips. I'm not moved by your evil glare. The way you toss your hair. You make stupid accusations. By which time I've lost the thread. Sometimes I wonder how it is. You get to piss me off this much. I may be heavier handed. And I like the tender touch. You moan and groan about me staying out. And drinking with the guys. I bet I bring them home trying. Something awfully wrong with this deal babe. Any fool could see its true. Can't you understand how I feel babe. You got me, but all I got is you. I guess I just don't have it in me. To keep you satisfied. To be honest with you babe. I'm only in it for the ride. And you may never bring yourself. To take me as I am. But in case you hadn't noticed. I don't give a fucking damn"
all the time in the world,"There's still a long way to go. And the nights are closing in. But if I'd travelled any faster, babe. Lord knows where I might have been. Right from those early days. I put my faith in the axle, not the wheels. Like old Zeno's toytus. With Achilles snapping at my heels. Don't worry. There's no hurry. Here we are. With all the time in the world. I could have been a high-flying dealer. But I have no desire for speed. I could have been a wide receiver. But I've got everything I need. And so I watch the world go racing by. Tearing up the street. I lay back in the long grass. Take it easy, (and) rest my feet. Don't worry. You know there's no hurry. Here we are. With all the time in the world. No-one ever held me back. You know that no-one ever put me in chains. No-one ever saw me racing ahead. No-one had to tug on my reins. As everybody knows, I may be slow. But I never quit. Sometimes, on a good day, I sit and think. Sometimes, I just sit. Don't worry. Relax, there's no hurry. Here we are. With all the time in the world. Don't worry. You know there's no hurry. Here we are. With all the time in the world"
almost human,"I know you're the only one who understands. Afore ye go, before you leave. You always shake my hand. Even when I'm crazy, on fire and naked. Just as Nature intended. No style but easily blended. You always know where I'll be found. Hanging somewhere near the ground. Help me up or help me down. Don't want to lose those days. When everything is just a haze. I'm dreaming. I believe I could walk before I learned to crawl. When I look up, the Devil's looking back. From the mirror on the wall. You can open the door. Got my feet stuck to the floor. I may have lost my way. But I didn't get where I am today. Don't want to lose those days. When everything is just a haze. I'm dreaming. You spin into my empty room. And once again I'm almost human. Almost human."
anthem,When the night wind softly blows through my open window. Then I start to remember the girl that brought me joy. Now the night wind softly blows sadness to tomorrow. Bringing tears to eyes so tired. Eyes I thought could cry no more. If the day would only come. Then you might just appear. even though you'd soon be gone. When I reached out my hand. If I could see you. If only I could see you. To see if you are laughing or crying. When the night winds softly blow. In my dark and whispering room. Memories still bring me a numbness to my feelings. Take my hand and brush my brow. In the warm and fevered dark. Heart is madly beating. My crazy thoughts are burning. When the night winds softly blow. If the day would only come. Then you might just appear. even though you'd soon be gone. When I reached out my hand. If I could see you. If only I could see you. To see if you are laughing or crying. When the night winds softly blow. If the day would only come. Then you might just appear. even though you'd soon be gone. When I reached out my hand. If I could see you. If only I could see you. To see if you are laughing or crying. When the night winds softly blow
any fule kno that,"If you're in the right city at the right time. What's the last thing going through your mind. Not talking 'bout your. Ask no questions, you know it's a lie. You could have been the victim of a corporate crime. All the signs of a shark attack. You've got rivers of blood. On the streets, don't look back. Nothing personal, just another snack. 'N Harley said you're better off sticking to your guns. Any fule kno that. Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz. And her friend Flash harry thinks he knows what it is. Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry don't know shit. Just trying to keep her happy. There's no laughing in heaven. Not the one, not the seven. And you'll never get to heaven in her row boat. Pea brain pisser, dog breath kisser. 'N Harley said you're better off sticking to your guns. Any fule kno that. Won't it be nice. When everything falls into place. Salad days go a-tickling by, have a high time. Burn money in the meantime, they bleed you dry. Those suckers are smaller than life. Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz. And her friend Flash harry thinks he knows what it is. Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry don't know shit. I'm better off sticking to my guns. Any fule kno that. Won't it be nice. When everything falls into place. Danny went down to the river one day. Didn't come back, that's the last, they say. We ever saw of him, that's no lie. Spitting in your eye, have no fear. You don't want the truth. Stick your finger in your ear. Any fule kno that."
anya,I'm so far away. From everything you know. Your name is carried on the wind. Your ice blue waters Anya. Where do they flow. Where have they been. Where have they been. A hidden passion. Touching a spark. Flame of revolution. Burning wild in your gypsy heart. Your gypsy heart. Anya - The spirit of freedom. Anya - Oh Anya. The light of freedom buried. Deep within your soul. Across the Puszta plain to see. The rhapsody of angels. Refuse to dance alone. What do they mean. What do they mean. Your jewel flashing. Across the dark. Forbidding distance. I love your gypsy heart. Your gypsy heart. Anya
anyone's daughter,"While I stood under your bedroom window. Throwin' up a brick. No one came, I threw one more. That really did the trick. Your daddy came and banged my head. He said what kind of man,. Is this that's hangin' round my girl?. Huh, he threw me in the can. You're a farmer's daughter. You're a farmer's daughter. Why do I always get. The kinda girl I didn't ought to get. I won't get no more. Eggs and water. Now I've laid the farmer's daughter. Imagine I was a full grown man. And I could talk just right. Could I come and see you here. And do this every night?. Wham!. The door comes crashing down. Your daddy's face all pale. Says ""come with me you hairy bum"". ""I'll put you in my jail"". You're a judge's daughter. You're a judge's daughter. Why do I always get the kinda girl. I didn't ought to get. Now I'm getting. Jail and torture. 'Cause I made. The judge's daughter. (Yes I did). (It was nice). Seems they're screaming. Law and order. When I go with anyone's daughter. Woman I should like some pease. And daddy hold your tongue. I think you're gonna die of fright. When I tell you what I've done. I can hear your tales and lies. You say I'm dumb and scraggy. But man this dumb and scraggy. Is your daughter's baby's daddy. She's a lucky daughter. Such a lucky daughter. Why did I always get. The kinda girl I didn't wanna get. Now I've got what I always fought for. 'Cause I married a rich man's daughter. (What do you think of that?)."
aprÃ¨s vous,"Should've been there to start the game. To witness why I was in. Me still the usual bow, got the awesome right ahead. Well that's just to bring. You understand the prospect of our mission. Nothing could possibly go alright til we lost out inhibition. (chorus). Then we hit the lights. Maybe we should bring the girl that is. There's nothing about it. Another world. While you go ahead, I'll clench my thirst. AprÃ¨s vous, so go first. (verse). Things got new since we tend to do. We'll liquefy the future. We just played our skills in romance. In the art of self-delusion. We went from chosen few, our confidence grew. It depends on where you're standing. It's not much you think. It's only a blink between takeoff and landing. (chorus). Then we hit the lights. Maybe we should bring the girl that is. There's nothing about it. Another world. While you go ahead, I'll clench my thirst. AprÃ¨s vous, so go first. (verse). Uh, come on man. Feel the boot turn. If it's a burst, so what can you do?. Yes I know that she wants me too. But I can? t jump the queue so aprÃ¨s vous. While you go ahead, I'll clench my thirst. AprÃ¨s vous!"
april,"April is a cruel time. Even though the sun may shine. And world looks in the shade as it slowly comes away. Still falls the April rain. And the valley's filled with pain. And you can't tell me quite why. As i look up to the grey sky. Where it should be blue. Grey sky where I should see you. Ask why, why it should be so. I'll cry, say that I don't know. Maybe once in a while I'll forget and I'll smile. But then the feeling comes again of an April without end. Of an April lonely as they come. In the dark of my mind I can see all too fine. But there is nothing to be done when I just can't feel the sun. And the springtime's the season of the night. Grey sky where it should be blue. Grey sky where I should see you. Ask why, why it should be so. I'll cry, say that I don't know. I don't know"
back to back,I read in the news. That the average man. Is uplifted five times a day. I'm confused. I have to confess. My feeling never goes away. I know it's right. They asked the average man. In a survey across the nation. I can't understand how the average man. Keeps losing his concentration. Oh you gotta use it. Oh you gonna lose it. I'm just begun. When you're all done. I see you running down the road. Can't hear a thing. My mind is blasted. And my head is about to explode. Feeling the pain. Just more of the same. As we're rolling through the night. Going so fast. We're sure to nit the next town Before the last one's out of sight. Oh you gotta use it. Oh you gonna lose it. Back to back. One on one. Shake it up. Move it on. Back to back. One on one. Turn it up. Hold it down

bananas,"I've got nothing to say today. I used my words up yesterday. I'm just lying here in the sun. Watching you guys having fun. Seven days and seven nights. Working till you got it right. Don't help me I'll help myself. I'll pull some crackers off the shelf. She had her hair done yesterday. Now she's coming out to play. First you pull and then you push. Two in the hand and one in the bush. Oh, my love is. So excited. When I say we've. Been invited. Now we're going. To the palace. Dressing up for. Tea with Alice. Some will rise and some will fall. Some will come to nothing at all. The strangest people have the power. To lead me to my darkest hour. How can you be sure it's me. When it's payment on delivery. Oh, my love is. So excited. When I say we've. Been invited. Now we're going. To the palace. Dressing up for. Tea with Alice. Now my love is. Richer than rich. 'Cause I studied. Mathematics. Graduated. Without honours. Everyone has. Gone Bananas."
before time began,"The daylight fades and the stars come out. But there's never much to talk about. Another day goes rushing by and here we are just wondering why. We have to belong with a sense of purpose. That's all we need, without them we're worthless. Ah, we've come so far, hmm, but then again. All we see is more of the same. It's getting crowded here we agree no doubt. Oh dear brother what's it all about?. Hey you over there why don't you throw down your spear?. We all need some help right now. Where are we going from here?. The way things are working out. It won't be too long before we have to move. Better start thinking about it while there's still time to choose. Every day of my life I discover. Someone murdering my sisters and brothers. In the name of some god or another. What do you know?. For the first precious few it's time to go. What might have been we'll never know. All those bad ideas became the law. Oh yes, we've forgotten what we're looking for. All of you angels it's time to gather your wings. Leave it all behind you won't need any of those things. We're going on through the darkness hand in hand. To step into the future. Before time began. And for those who remain with your chosen gods. May your prayers be answered."
bird has flown,Oh the beggar on his cornerstone. Catches pity in his wrinkled hand. But the lover whose bird has flown. Catches nothing only grains of sand. All the children in the distant house. They have feelings only children know. But the lover whose bird has flown. Catches nothing only flakes of snow. The sensation is not new to you. It's something we all have known. You get it - it goes right through you. Yes it's something we all have known. And the bird it has flown. To a place on it's own. Somewhere all alone. Now the hermit in his lonely cave. Has himself to keep him company. But the lover whose bird has flown. He has heartaches same as you and me. The sensation's not new to you. It's something we all have known. You get it - it goes right through you. Yes it's something we all have known. And the bird it has flown. Now the hermit in his lonely cave. Has himself to keep him company. But the lover whose bird has flown. He has heartaches same as you and me. Oh it's started snowing
birds of prey,Alarm bells ringing clear. Break the calm before the fall. Bad news travels at the speed of flight. Good news not at all. And here we are again. Playing endless games of war. Birds of prey. Without a word of warning. We dive in to attack. Vengeful and self-righteous. We turn the blue sky black. And a wretched few escape. They'll be forever looking back. At our sacrifice. And the golden sun is rising. At the dawn of a beautiful day. In the name of all that's holy. In the name of history. In the face of life and nature. We are driven by belief. Our faith a crumbling fortress. Once perfect and sublime. Will fail again and rise again. Until the death. Until the death of time
black and white,Read all about it tell me. Have you heard the news. Captain bob he don't pay no dues. You know he's looking in my window. He's stepping on my toes. Don't want the truth and it goes to show. I got a joker up my sleeve. I know what to believe. It ain't right just because it's in black and. White. Find yourself a hero. Treat him like a friend. You build him up and tear him down again. It don't hold a candle hold it to the light. Check it out is it wrong or right. Is this the news of the world. It's just a pretty girl. She's all the news that's fit to print in. Black and white. Inside information taken down note by note. A silent footstep that's all she wrote. Shit that's all she wrote.

black night,"Black night is not right,. I don't feel so bright,. I don't care to sit tight.. Maybe I'll find on the way down the line. that I'm free, free to be me.. Black night is a long way from home.. I don't need a dark tree,. I don't want a rough sea,. I can't feel, I can't see.. Maybe I'll find on the way down the line. that I'm free, free to be me.. Black night is a long way from home.. Black night, black night,. I don't need black night,. I can't see dark night.. Maybe I'll find on the way down the line. that I'm free, free to be me..

blind,"(Lord). Jon plays harpsichord on this track, which is a love song, sort of squeezed into the format of a twelve bar blues. The middle section is a descending chromatic sequence which is intended to give a sort of ""slowing down"" effect.. I see reflections in the water. Autumn colours, summer's daughter. And as as the year is growing older. I see winter on my shoulder. I stand in the haze. Watching stormy ripples grow on my own. Never knew your needed. Till I found myself standing here alone. And in the water, such a sad face. Slowly drowning, such a sad face. If only I could change the seasons. Like a poet, I've my reasons. It started to snow in the middle of July. Wonder why. Never did understand you. My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky. In the summer days we flew to the sun. On melting wings. But the seasons changed to fast. Leave us all behind. Blind. But then the stone fell on the water. Putting end to summer's daughter. And me, I turn away remembering. All the seasons, such a sad thing. It started to rain in the middle of the sun. Winter's begun. Never did understand you. My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky. In the summer days we flew to the sun. On melting wings. But the seasons changed to fast. Leave us all behind. Blind."
blood from a stone,"In the shadow of the whole. Where my door used to be. You never give up, you want more out of me. Come on in, help yourself. Scratch around over these empty shelves. There's nothing else that I can see. Except a string of these in some old bowery. You rip flesh from a bone. You sip blood from a stone. I will consider a life of crime. So I can feed these kids of mine. And should I fall down, should I fail. I'll spend the rest of my days in some stinking jail. I won't know who left me to your side. Stripped of my dignity low and dry. You rip flesh from a bone. You sip blood from a stone. Uh that's damn nothing. Uh, I don't care. You rob me blind without a gun. How can you sleep after what you've done?. There's nothing but darkness deep in your soul. There's no reflection, it's dark and it? s cold. [x2]. You rip flesh from a bone. You sip blood from a stone"
bloodsucker,"A particularly nasty sort of fellow, there are lots of us. Gotta black breast Chinese eyes. Got an English brain that's gonna make me wise. Got a long story that I wanna tell. To a rhythm that I know so well. Really got a lot of lovin' that I wanna give. Baby I'm a mystery but you know I gotta live. I tried another but she didn't want to know. Take a hold now if you can. Take a lesson from a hard lovin' man. I'm a long way from where I wanna go. Guess I'll stay awhile I really love you so. How's about another sip of all the wine you got. Take a tip from me and give it here I'll drink the lot. I'm not a winey, I'm a puttin' on a show. You really grab me but I've gotta move. Before they know I'm here and spread the news. Maybe in while when I've moved around. I can find a way to pay you back your twenty pounds. Really got a lot of lovin' that I wanna give. Baby I'm a mystery but you know I gotta live. I tried another but she didn't want to know"
body line,"(Verse). I've been watching you dancing all night long. Your legs go on forever. Exquisite synchronicity, they never stayed together. My head's spinning, keeping focused on my mind. and building this. I don't know who you are. but I'm enslaved to make your service. (Chorus). Makes you fall in line. A moving silhouette. It's your body line. You do that thing you read. Make you fall in line. Clearly defined. It's your body line. A perfect outline, so divine. (Verse). Chilling to half it must've been hazy. Smoking my eye a poppin. Fight for your country, you got something to gain. No one but Mike Jones driving. Girl come in and out, my excuse to get me is in danger. No will but that's like just emptied it. Wouldn't wanna be disillusion. (Chorus 2). Makes you fall in line. So heavenly ashamed. It's your body line. My oh my, oh my, oh my. Make you fall in line. A perfect outline, so divine. Body line. (Bridge). When we're moving, connection. Well bring me to the main view. It seems to want distraction. But what I need. (Chorus). Makes you fall in line. A moving silhouette. It's your body line. You do that thing you read. Make you fall in line. Clearly defined. It's your body line, body line. A perfect outline, so divine"
breakfast in bed,"(Blackmore/Glover/Turner) 5.16. Woke up this morning, rain coming down. Washing the sin from the street. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing ground. Just trying to make ends meet. Well I work every day to sweat out my dreams. Won't you show me that you understand. It's only my life, whatever that means. And you've got it all in your hands. I need someone to pull me through. Won't you take the pain from my head. Give me all your loving, the way you always do. Give me breakfast in bed. I feel like the good days are numbered. And my nights are getting too long. My hopes and my fears take their toll on the years. And my willpower's almost gone. Well it's a time full of trouble. A time of desperate need. Sometimes life don't make sense. Fighting the anger, jealousy and greed. One day I'll look back and wonder where it all went. I need someone to pull me through. Won't you take the pain from my head. Give me all your loving, the way you always do. Give me breakfast in bed. It don't take much to please me. I'm just a simple man. Won't you please believe me. I gotta tell you. It don't take much - a tender touch. So baby do the best that you can."
burn,"The sky is red, I don't understand,. past midnight I still see the land.. People are sayin' the woman is damned,. she makes you burn with a wave of her hand.. The city's a blaze, the town's on fire.. The woman's flames are reaching higher.. We were fools, we called her liar.. All I hear is ""Burn!"". I didn't believe she was devil's sperm.. She said, ""Curse you all, you'll never learn!. When I leave there's no return."". The people laughed till she said, ""Burn!"". Warning came, no one cared.. Earth was shakin', we stood and stared.. When it came no one was spared.. Still I hear ""Burn!"". You know we had no time,. we could not even try.. You know we had no time.. You know we had no time,. we could not even try.. You know we had no time.. The sky is red, I don't understand,. past midnight I still see the land.. People are sayin' the woman is damned,. she makes you burn with a wave of her hand.. Warning came, no one cared.. Earth was shakin, we stood and stared.. When it came no one was spared.. Still I hear ""Burn!""."
call of the wild,(Blackmore/Gillan/Glover/Lord). operator i'm looking for a girl. you've got to help me get through. i don't know much about her. so i'm relying on you. she got rhythm but no sense of timing. she likes living but she's got no. address. operator you've got to get me out of. this mess. let me tell you about her. she ain't got a face. she ain't got a name. she ain't got a leg to stand upon. she's out of touch. but not out of mind. and i've got to see again that gypsy. child. operator this is the call of the wild. she's a hitch hiker never gets a ride. but you can bet she's on time. she's always around but so hard to. find. she causes trouble she never takes. offence. dirty mind a heart of gold. operator don't you put me on hold.
cascades: i'm not your lover,"You know I'm not. your lover now. it might as well be said. and then you say. you're leaving. Or maybe I'm just. hanging on a thread. When I gave you everything. it didn't seem that much. You gave me your opinion. with the usual. heavy handed touch. What can I do. About the rain that falls on you. I'm not your lover now. I'm not your lover now. What can I do. About the rain that falls on you. I'm not your lover now. I'm not your lover now. My head is spinning endlessly. My sense won't react. Then I'm falling through a black hole. Part of me is never coming back. How you can lose a thing. you never really had. And you always hurt the one you love. and you just love to hurt me bad. What can I do. About the rain that falls on you. I'm not your lover now. I'm not your lover now. What can I do. About the sky that falls on you. I'm not your lover. You really must be going now. By god, is that the time?. Let me put you out. of my misery. They call it being cruel. to be kind. I only insult my friends. my friend. The rest can go to hell. You can read it. anyway you want. oh well, you're not so bad yourself. What can I do. About the rain that falls on you. I'm not your lover now. I'm not your lover now."
chasing shadows,"(Lord/Paice). An original idea of ian's, who is heard playing drums, timbales, maracas and cowbell. Jon is playing claves. The percussion instruments were tracked on afterwards of course. The song is about one of jon's nightmares. Nicky's bass line is a gas.. Jon Lord said this about the song in April 1996:. The song was something to do with a nightmare I'd had and the lyrics as I wrote them were:. Chasing shadows, over my walls. with myself hardly sleeping. Dwarfs and giants, twenty feet tall. fill the room with their creeping. Sounds of breathing sharpen my ears. then they fade into nothing. Someone's laughter out in the street. fills the night with their loving. I feel the ice in my head. Running its hands through my bed. Not even dreaming I seem to be dead. Colours of yellow and colours of red. All I'm asking some secret voice. is to lead me to darkness. Jon forgot the two last lines:. I'm so tired, dawn never comes. I just hide in the shadows."
child in time,"Sweet child in time you'll see the line. The line that's drawn between the good and the bad. See the blind man shooting at the world. Bullets flying taking toll. If you've been bad, Lord I bet you have. And you've been hit by flying lead. You'd better close your eyes and bow your head. And wait for the ricochet"
clearly quite absurd,After all we said today. The strangest thought occurred. I feel I ought to tell you. But it's clearly quite absurd. Wouldn't it be wonderful. If you could read my mind. Imagine all the stuff. That we could leave behind. How many words you waste. Before you're understood. Or simply sow some seeds. You'd do it if you could. Let me take a moment. Of your time. Inside you mind. I know what you're thinking. But I don't know what to say. The turmoil and the conflict. You don't have to feel that way. Look into my eyes. And feel my hand upon your heart. Holding us together. Not tearing us apart. How many words we waste. To justify a crime. Compare it to an act of love. That really takes no time. Why not take a moment. Of your time. Inside your mind
comin' home,"(Bolin/Coverdale/Paice). My mama showed me how to rock in the cradle,. But I learned how to roll along.. My papa said ""son, gotta git some fun,. Cos when your old it ain't too good on your own"". Been so long, since you heard my song. Gonna pick up my guitar 'n' play. Felt so bad when I had to leave you. But I knew that I'd be back some day. So I'm comin' home. To give you more than you bargained for.... Comin' home. No mistake I'm gonna shiver 'n' shake.... Comin' home. Gonna rock 'n' roll an' give you my soul.... Comin' home. I got over the pain I'm comin' home again.... Groovin to American Bandstand,. B.B. onstage with 'Lucille',. The thrill is gone, but, it won't be for long. Cos you know I like to play how you feel.

doing it tonight,"I don't have a problem. I'm not seeking her advice. I'm saving that for later. Yeh, it's something awful nice. I had a shaky feeling. When she floated into sight. I imagine we'll be doing it tonight. I'm ragged round the edges. All these people in the room. There's magic in the air. I'm guessing she can feel it too. Prospective recreation. Helps me keep her in my sight. I imagine we'll be doing it tonight. That's why everybody's sitting around. We can't think of nothing better to do. There's no empty bottle. They're all half full. So we end up spinning a shoe. We keep on going 'til poor old Lenny's. Got drool hanging off of his chin. He can't stop winning. When the shoe stops spinning. But he doesn't know where to begin. She wasn't in the running. She was never in the game. I could see her in the distance. But I could not lay my claim. Let me tell you 'bout this cherry. I never got a single bite. Therefore I imagine we'll be doing it tonight."
don't hold your breath,"One day I'll get home before the sun hits the blinds. And give you - I'll give you something to remember me by. That's the way I am. It's what I got in mind but I don't know if I can. You gotta shoot your gun - don't expect me to dance. Hold me up to the spotlight but. Don't, don't hold your breath. Don't hold your breath. Don't hold your breath. Don't hold your breath. These empty pockets are my deepest friends. Full of nothing but good intentions. That's the way it is. It may not be much but I can blow you a kiss.

I may be Lazy or a Living Wreck. I won't be swayed by your expectations. That's the way it is. It may not be much but you know what to kiss. I've been wrong - I've been wrong once before.

don't let go,"I get lost on a regular basis. I'm not alone I see the same old faces. Back on the road it's a worthy opponent. I get home in the heat of the moment. What's that stuff always rise to the surface. College cream, it always emerges. Be what you are I tell myself. And myself tells me we can't be anybody else. You always sleep with a smile on your face. Much as I want to put myself in your place. Not my business I've got dreams of my own. I try to recall but when I wake up it's gone. Don't let go of that image. You'll never see it again. I can hear voices they're buzzing in my head. Eyebrows raised was it something I said. A long hot night, it crept in like a thief. The engine stopped, the seatbelt popped. And her jaw dropped in disbelief. Don't let go of that beast. You'll never see it again. Don't let go of that whisky bottle. You'll never see it again"
don't make me happy,"You stare into the room, nothing there but space. No sign of any message gone without a trace. But I don't want your pity, if that's what you think. I'll take my comfort from this hole I'm sinking in. Waste my time, drink my wine, take my money. That's alright, I don't mind but don't try to be funny. Don't make me good. Don't make me mad. Don't make me fly. Don't make me happy. It's nice here in this room, you would like it, yes you would. It's got a bed, two chairs and a table, I'd leave here if I could. There's a man standing up who's down on his knees. Outside the cold wind sends a shiver through the trees. On the line, left behind, under pressure. It's so bad, leave me be, I don't want to get better. Don't make me good. Don't make me mad. Don't make me fly. Don't make me happy. I don't care what you think but think about this. It could have been somebody else, beware of what you wish. Now the door is closed, locked and sealed. And now you think you know how rejection feels. Waste my time, drink my wine, take my money. That's alright, I don't mind but don't try to be funny. Don't make me good. Don't make me mad. Don't make me fly. Don't make me happy."

So nobody knows my name. Born a loser. I'm beyond the law. Women behind me. Never can find me. They can never get together. What I've been here for. Cos I'm a drifter. Rollin' on. Ain't wastin' my time no more. .

evil louie,"Some say the state of Texas. Could accommodate the entire human population. Five point six billion versions of the truth. Under one roof, some revelation. Tale a bit of this, give a bit of that. Put it in a blender, pull it out a hat. There's no going back. It's a lie, it's a fact. Has the cat got your tongue. Been too long in the sun. There's dust on your tracks. There's no going back. Come to think of it's a load of monkeys. Every time you listen to your sun kissed lover's words. Evil Louie is tomorrow's sadness. It's a game of madness in a perfect world. Some would say French cuisine's more appealing. Than a cold drink, burgers and fries. Some have said that a pillar of society. An upright citizen's incapable of lust and crime. Tale a bit of this, give a bit of that. Put it in a blender, pull it out a hat. But he don't stand a change. With his pants around his ankles. Has the cat got your tongue. Been too long in the sun. There's dust on your tracks. There's no going back."

You don't know the pain I feel. As I must live again. Rocks and stones can't bruise my soul but. Tears will leave a stain. They smile to themselves as they lay down my head. On some distant hill. The blind and the child sweep a tear from their eye. Fools smile as they kill. I got my own way to go and now I want. To take your minds. I believe if you could see. The blood between the lines. I believe that you could be. A better kind. Please lead the way so the unborn can play. On some greener hill. Laugh as the flames eat their burning remains. Fools die laughing still.

holy man,(Coverdale/Hughes/Lord). Called to Madonna. To give me a line. She said boy what have you done. Passing your time with a holy man. Talking about the moon and sun. But I can't tell the difference. Between the fool and wise. Show me a river to follow. Away from all these lies. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been picking up my bones too long. Won't you understand. Called to the Captain. To put me ashore. For it looked like no man's land. Is this the way to follow. I cried as I shook his hand. He told me had no answer. He didn't really hold the key. I am a simple man. Was all he said to me. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me a hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand. I've been on the road so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand. Heard my mother crying. She was calling out my name. Whisper in the dark night. Saying who's to blame. The hour glass keeps turning. With not enought sand to see. I am a holy man. So don't you bother me. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been pickin' up my bones too long. Won't you understand. I've been on my own so long. Won't you lend me your hand. I've been out in the cold too long. Won't you understand?. .

Different girls, laughing girls, forever. girls. and it's so loud. The crew have lost again. they are beaten men. The winning team united. living for the crowd. These are the hungry daze."

i need love,(Bolin/Coverdale). I keep singing the same old song. Like I did before. When you left me. You left me in darkness. I'd never known before. I was restless. A fool for your time. Waiting 'round for you to call. But now I've found me. An angel of mercy. I don't feel bad at all. Your body was honey. I tasted a lot. But let me tell you babe. I need more than you got. I want someone to hold me. An' keep me satisfied. I need love. I've got nothing to do. Ain't got nothing to say. Just live your life. The way you know. When you moved on. You took all the sweetness.

i'm alone,"(Blackmore/Gillan/Glover/Lord/Paice). On the lonely road I'm travelling on. The road that leads nowhere. As the ground and the sky wondering why. I'm alone so alone. I kept rolling on from tears for years. Sun is my only friend. With the wind on the bend and my pack in my hand. I'm alone so alone. I'm alone so alone. I'm alone so alone. I'm alone so alone. And I feel like going home. With my money spent, my clothes all torn. My spirit can't grow. I ain't got no friend where the power ends. I'm alone so alone. I'm alone so alone. I'm alone so alone.

But that's where the story ends. If you say jump. I'll do it with affection. But don't get pissed. If I don't move. Too fast in your direction. I got your number. I got your number. I got your number. It's that same old nonsense. That same old look. But now I'm turning back. And I can read you like a book. It all means nothing. Nothing at all. It's the same old business. Man it drives me up the wall. You made the potion too strong. I feel I'm going soft. I've been that way far too long. You see, now it's wearing off. So many times. So many days. It's a spiritual thing. That loving touch. I thought you'd be amazed. I like the distance. I like the space. The money's good. The rent is cheap. And I can read suspicion on your face. I got your number. I got your number. I got your number."

I'm gonna look on the mountains and in the deep blue sea. Gonna search all the forests and look in every tree. I'm gonna look in the cities where the lights are blue.

it's all over,"Outside her window. That's where I am every night and every day. But outside her window. I cry, I cried my life away. There's a jukebox a-playin'. A half a block down. Singing I'm going to the river. I'm gonna jump on in and drown. But I ain't gonna do it, no. Just gonna keep on hanging around. Oh it's all over. Oh it's all over. All over. Now, now, now, now. But outside her window. A pretty bird comes to play. And I know, I know I must have cried a teardrop. Because I scared that pretty little thing right on away. When I see two young lovers. Walkin' down the street. It just hits me. When I see their two lips meet. Oh I put my head. Right over where my heart used to be, 'cos. It's all over. Oh don't tell me it's all over. It's all over. Now, now, now, now"
jack ruby,"There's no method in my madness, no craft, no guile. No expertise, no self assuring smile. No wizardry or witchcraft, no crass deceit. No dark conspiracies, I stand on my own two feet. I'm coming through just like Jack Ruby. I ragged around the edges but I got control. There's no way around it and I got control. I reach out for my program, still got control. Straight down to business, who needs control. I've got panache just like Jack Ruby. I don't beg forgiveness, I don't beg at all. But I beg to differ cos I got the ball. There was no invitation, you're not my type. And what's gone, it ain't worth having, kiss it all goodbye. Right on the money just like Jack Ruby."
johnny's band,"Johnny Jones woke up one day from dreaming. Told Bill the bass and soon they had a plan. He passed it on to Pete and Crazy Benny. Ah, suddenly they had a band. Hey Johnny's Band. He sure knew how to work up a crowd. The sound that they made put the rest in the shade. And the word soon got around. They played every dance hall in the city. Wrote themselves a cool forty-five. With a bullet it shot to the top of the pops. Oh man it was good to be alive. Hail Johnny's Band. Hear them on the radio. Smash after smash now they're rolling in the cash. Whatever they touch turns to gold. Benny went down with the hard stuff. And Pete joined a cult in LA. Johnny and Bill started going downhill. And the crowds began melting away. But hey, it's Johnny's Band. Playing Saturday nights at The Crown. The beards may be long and the money's long gone. It's a wonder that they're still around. But hey, it's Johnny's Band. Playing all those wonderful songs. Making the rounds with that old fashioned sound. And here we are singing along"
junkyard blues,"Broken down relations, beaten up guitars. Making one last appearance in a heap of old cars. Brambles and weeds flourishing amongst. Lines of empty bottles and rambling drunks. Junkyard blues sound familiar. I'm never alone. Always remind me of home. One of a dozen covered with stains. Blistered and stinking was all that remained. Cannibalised machines, mysterious bones. Unwanted contents of anonymous homes. Those junkyard blues sound familiar. Take me back. Always remind me of home. Mangy old dog scratching in the dust. Burned out Mercedes surrendering to rust. All this stuff was good for something. But here it is now, good for nothing. Junkyard blues sound familiar. I'm never alone. Always remind me of home"

kiss tomorrow goodbye,I threw a rock in the lake and it sank to the bottom. The waves spread out but the rock got forgotten. The ripples came back just as we feared. Looking for the rock but the hole disappeared. It's somewhere in the middle some way down. The last guy that went looking almost certainly drowned. He ran out of time. He can kiss tomorrow goodbye. Yes I piss in the water and burn down trees. I watch as the creatures fall to their knees. They ain't got a clue as disaster looms. They're too busy choking on toxic fumes. They got no hope and there's no point running. No matter what they do I keep on coming. They ran out of time. They can kiss tomorrow goodbye. I did a bad thing. I did a bad thing. I did a bad thing. I did a bad thing. Well hallelujah and holy mackerel. All we got left is a thief and a jackal. The writing is big and it's there on the wall. Oh how the mighty empires fall. There's nothing to fix it's much too late. Sit down and prepare to meet your fate. You have run out of time. Kiss tomorrow goodbye
knocking at your back door,Sweet Lucy was a dancer. But none of us would chance her. Because she was a Samurai. She made electric shadows. Beyond our fingertips. And none of us could reach that high. She came on like a teaser. I had to touch and please her. Enjoy a little paradise. The log was in my pocket. When Lucy met the Rockett. And she never knew the reason why. I can't deny it. With that smile on her face. It's not the kill. It's the thrill of the chase. Feel it coming. It's knocking at the door. You know it's no good running. It's not against the law. The point of no return. And now you know the score. And now you're learning. What's knockin' at your back door. Sweet Nancy was so fancy. To get into her pantry. Had to be the aristocracy. The members that she toyed with. At her city club. Were something in diplomacy. So we put her on the hit list. Of a common cunning linguist. A master of many tongues. And now she eases gently. From her Austin to her Bentley. Suddenly she feels so young

lady luck,(Cook/Coverdale). She was a juke-box dancer. A blue eyed gypsy queen. She always had an answer. For what she'd done. And where she'd been. A feathercane Lady Midnight. For all around to see. She spoke with words of wisdom. And this is what she said to me. Lady luck. C'mon give me what I want. Pull me up. Lady luck. If I see you again. I will call you my friend. I have always been a sinner. But then the lady came along. She stole my heart and turned me 'round. 'Till I didn't know right from wrong. She whispered words of kindness. I'd never ever heard before. Golden words and silver tongue. Till I really couldn't take no more. Lady luck. C'mon give me what I want. Pull me up. Lady luck. If I see you again. I will call you my friend. C'mon shake me. .
lalena,"(Donovan). Donovan's song done how we thought Donovan might like to have heard it. The only double tracking on this cut is the guitar passage at the end. The slightly ""jazzy"" feel to the organ is a bow in the direction of Donovan's mellow yellow days.. When the sun goes to bed. That's the time your raise your head. That's your lot in life Lalena. Can't blame you Lalena. Arty Tart la de da. Can your part get much sadder. That's your lot in life Lalena. Can't blame you Lalena. Run you hand thru your hair. Paint your face with despair.

Arty Tart Oh so la de da. Can your part ever get, ever get much sadder. That's your lot in life Lalena. Can't blame you Lalena. Oh, Lalena."

I just want to get right down and lick it up.

mary long,"Mary Long is a hypocrite. She does all the things that she tells us not to do. Selling filth from a corner shop. And knitting patterns to the high street queue. She paints roses, even makes them smell good. And then she draws titties on the khazy wall. Drowns kittens just to get a thrill. And writes sermons in the Sunday Chronicle. How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long ?. When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long ?. Mary told Johnny not to write such trash. Said it was a waste of public money. She made a fuss, they made apologies. But everybody thought the show was funny. When the nation knew you'd had children. It came as such a surprise. We really didn't know you'd had it in you. How you did it we can only surmise. How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long ?. When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long ?. Mary Long, you're not alone. But you're a long way behind our times. What we do in full frontal view. Is more honest than your clean-up mind. What I'm saying, Mary Long is. When you can spare a minute. Go find your friend the porny Lord. Dig your self a hole and jump in it. How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long ?. When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long ?."
maybe i'm a leo,"Peeping round the door I got a big surprise. Couldn't see a thing but open skies. They've taken her away where is she now. Wish that she was here wish she'd hold my hand. Maybe she could laugh maybe understand. Why was I so cruel where is she now. Acting like a fool I had to make her cry. Maybe I'm a Leo but I ain't a lion. I'm hurting oh so bad, I want her now."

She drives me crazy gets inside my brain. She spend my money down a drain. So I roll over for my reward. How much can I afford. And she says. Just a little more. I can't take this no more. I tried so hard but I can't get thru' the. door. Because one smile from those eyes. And I stand there paralysed. And she says. Beg for more get down sucka you know. what I like. oh hang on.

money talks,"I was young and healthy. Extremely wealthy. I swung in the trees. And did as I pleased. I thought I was rich. Oh yeah. Such sweet seduction. I could feel the suction. Greasing my palm. And doing no harm. Just making some deals. What a bitch. Money talks to me. Whispers in my ear. Gives me everything I want. Everything I want. I had rising stock. So I got more pockets. I knew somewhere to stick it. Where no-one would nick it. I kinda went private. And then, aha. Such sweet seclusion. No more intrusion. Too much food on my plate. But there's guards at the gate. Such joy. I could almost die of it. Money talks to me. Lays it on the line. Gives me everything I want. Everything I want. Money goes to money. Yes it always returns. Finds its way back to the big house. Where it lives all alone. Wraithlike silent partners. Operators of the system. Give words of quiet assurance. To an otherwise healthy victim. It's all coming back to me. I would swing in the trees. And I'd swim in the ocean. I used to show some emotion. I was not to blame. I feel no shame. The structure was shaking. Was there for the taking. I had the resources. But then, oh no. Someone outbid me. I can't take it with me?. Then I will devour it. I can't go without it. It's simply a question of. Market forces. Money talks to me. Whispers in my ear. Gives me everything I want. Everything I want. Money talks to me. Laughs right in my face. Gives me everything I want. Everything I want"
mtv,"I was driving through the night. Into an endless tunnel of fog. When it dawned on me something was wrong. I was in a trance, hypnotised. Bored beyond belief. I was listening to the same old song. I know every lick, every word. Every nuance. I'm on first name terms with the crew. But I'd better get used to this poop du jour. Sure as hell they won't play anything new. Oh yes I love you really. Classic Rock Radio. Oh my dear it's time for bed. Time for you to go. Everyone is asleep. The pirates took to the water stole the charts. But sadly that didn't go down well with those upstairs. Who require loyalty. The establishment considered. That the uncontrolled appreciation of music. Was a danger to royalty. The mighty empire roared. As Cash 'n' Everitt on the high seas. Looked like they'd get blown out of the water. They did of course eventually come ashore. As meek as mice or to be more accurate. As lambs to the slaughter. Oh yes I love you really. I stand to attention. Oh Fanny, I love you dearly. Something else I should mention?. You sweet thing. Let's not talk about MTV. I don't even want to start. I want to take a look at Classic Rock Radio. We're talking about the state of the art. Mr. Grover 'n' Mr Gillian. You musta made a million. The night that Frank Zappa caught on fire. Could you tell us all about it. Keep it short and use my version. Or everyone out there'll think I'm a liar. We can speak about bananas for one second. Just because I understand. You have to get them off your chest. But in the meantime while your talking. Could you do some more of these here ID's. And then this station might maintain some interest. Oh yes I love you dearly. But why do you exist?. Oh yes I love you really. Is there something that I missed?"
nasty piece of work,I got my feelers out. Pleasure I can give you pain. I'm the demon of misfortune. Let me tell you that bad luck is my game. Fires burning make you cold. You can touch but you can't hold. It's an even split. Between zip and the number on your ticket. Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt. I'm a nasty piece of work. Down get down on your knees. Running gonna bring you down. I'm the demon of disorder. You know I'm gonna drive you into the ground. As you're stepping through the door. My shadow crawls across your floor. Your dream of love. It's not enough it's gonna come to nothing. You ain't seen nothing it's gonna get worse. I'm a nasty nasty. It's an even split. Between zip and the number on your ticket. Your dream of love. It's not enough it's gonna come to nothing. Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt. You ain't seen nothing it's gonna get worse. I'm a nasty piece of work.
never a word,"Never a word, a word so true. Passed between us, me and you. Heard you found your pot of gold. That's the story I've been told. Never a word was said in vain. Some were never sad again. Some were lost in lovers' heat. Some lay fallen at our feet. All day all night. You and only you. All day all night. I think of you and only you. Never a word escaped my lips. Silenced by your fingertips. I kept my word, can you believe. All this time so hard to breathe. Hard to breathe."
never before,Somebody Somebody. Come to my side. I'm tired I'm crying. I'm sick inside. My woman that woman. Just wasn't right. CHORUS. Help me now please my friend. I never felt so bad before. Never never before. So funny so funny. Just like a show. One name two people. All in a row. Somebody Somebody. Someone must go. Chorus. I was hurt when I was younger. By a woman who was cold. She took my name. She took my body. And she threw away my soul. Can't hide I can't hide my misery. I know my sorrow won't set me free. She did it d'you see she did it to me. Help me now please my friend. I never felt so bad before. Never never before
no no no,Really hate the running really hate the game. Looking at them all I wanna be unborn again. Their suit is getting tighter although they're getting thin. The flies are crawling on their face and trying to get in. People say that we're to blame I say. No no no it's just the game. Must we let them fool us no no no. Have we got our freedom no no no. Is it getting better no no no. Do we love each other no no no. Must we wait forever no no no. Heads are getting stronger bodies getting weak. Looking at them all it feels good to be a freak. Their hands are getting closer they're reaching out so far. The greenies gonna get them make them serve stars. Tell them how it is and they say. No no no we know it all. The washing's getting dirty the air is getting thin. It's all in such a mess that no one knows where to begin. They talk about creating but all they do is kill. They say we're gonna mend it but they never will. Poison in the rain but they say. No no no we ain't to blame.
no one came,Maybe it's because I'm only starting. That I think it won't take too long. Maybe it's because I can see you laughing. That I think you've got it wrong. Maybe I could be like Robin Hood. Like and outlaw dressed all in green. Someone said what's he gonna turn out like. And someone else said never mind. Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old. As all the cats I'd ever seen. I grew my hair and bought a suit. Of shiny white or was it cream. I shook and shivered danced and quivered. And stood on a mountain top. No one came from miles around and said. Man your music is really hot. Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak. My throat was tired and worn. My pretty face just looked out of place. As they poured on the scorn. I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king. He said my boy we'll have some crazy scenes. There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about. He must've been the king of queens. Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done. But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung. There's a law for the rich and one for the poor. and there's another one for singers. It's die young and live much longer. Spend your money and sit and wonder. No one came for miles around. And said man your music is really funky. I believe that I must tell the truth. And say things as they really are. But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth. Could I ever be a star. Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'. Everyone's shouting out loud. It's only the glitter and shine that gets through. Where's my Robin Hood outfit. Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye. No one ever cared enought to say goodbye. The money's good and the time you have. Fun and games galore. But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten. And you wonder what you did it for. No one came from miles around. And said man who's he?.
nobody's home,(Blackmore/Glover/Gillan/Lord/Paice). Nothing I can do about it. Maybe I won't even try. Your will is determined to kill any. Reason of mine. I see you coming. With that look in your eye. You act like a king but you ain't got a. thing. In your mind. And now there's nobody home. My belly is aching. Your image is blown. Your lights are burning bright. But Nobody's Home. You talk about love and affection. If only you could. You're full of pride but there's nothing. inside. And you think you're so good. You know you got it coming to ya. All things return. You need me. It's not gonna be my concern. And now there's nobody home. Your message is changing. The children have grown. Your lights are burning bright. But nobody's home. I hear you crying. What can I say. You get what you give so. Forgive me as I turn away. Nobody's home. A legend is dying. The seeds have been sown. Your lights are burning bright. But Nobody's Home.
not responsible,"(Blackmore/Glover/Gillan/Lord/Paice). Found some money in an old black jacket. I'm going out tonight, gonna find me a woman or two. I don't know how long it'll last. But I never regret the past. When I wake up tomorrow, I'll be looking around for you. I got no reason to be down at the station. I got no ticket, but I'm gonna take a fucking ride. Don't care where I go. I never seem to know. I never had a penny, but I never wondered why. Oh no, I never wondered why. If I'm cold I need some heat. If I'm hungry then I eat. I'm not responsible. I woke up this morning and I couldn't find my shoes. It's one long party and I haven't seen the sun for days. I'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light. So let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed. I take my woman to the palace dancing. I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine. So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe. You can pay the bill and while you're at it pick up mine. Oh, no no, I don't mind. If it rains I stay inside. If I'm scared I run and hide. I'm not responsible, oh no.."
oh no no no,You think by leaving me the sun will go away. You think that if you go there'll be no other way. But your leaving now won't even spoil my day. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. You keep a-waiting for the tears I'm supposed to cry. The promise leaves so I'm supposed to die. I'd forgotten who you were until you dropped on by. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. You think I'm guilty throwing off the likes of you. That there'll be no one else but there'll be quite a few. At least I've got my head but somehow I'll pull through. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no. Oh no no no
on top of the world,"Hot summer night. the working girls were on their way back home. It was getting late so I tagged along. couldn't let them walk alone. I followed them up some greasy steps to a rooftop in the sky. No walls around just a sea of stars. my throat was getting dry. Everyone could feel the heat that's why we all disrobed. Our clothes and inhibitions went off flying 'cross the globe. Dancing crazy getting loose and closer to the edge. I could feel my blood was up. and it was pounding in my head. So there I was, just me and the girls. Under the moonlight on top of the world. So there I was, just me and the girls. Under the moonlight on top of the world. As things were dying down we retreated from the precipice. I lay beside the most beautiful girl in the universe. Her name was Venus in Heaven. She fed me rice and offered me wine. I accepted ambrosia and nectar. From an amber goddess. I collapsed between the thighs of Morpheus. Next thing I felt was a sharp pain of sunrise. My mouth was open and full of rice. As I managed to prize open one of my eyes. I saw Luigi the cockroach carry off his prize. And there lay Venus still sprawled out and naked for sure. But not quite what she was the night before. I made my excuses and left through the door. Stepped into space at the twentieth floor. And that's why I don't like heights no more"
one man's meat,Cold beer and a strange cigarette. Getting you high getting you wet. Falling in love falling out of debt. Straight gay black or white. Strutting in the dark hiding in the light. Doing it wrong doing it right just doing it. You got your life on the one hand. Mine in the other. I got the right we all got the right. One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck. One man's meat is someone's empty well. One man's meat is some guy's aching butt. One man's meat is another man's living hell. Short fat thick or thin. Take it in the gut take it on the chin. Living in glory living in sin. Hard day's work going down slow. Riding the road where the greengrass grows. Watching in die what d'you know. Watch it. You got your life on the one hand. Mine in the other. I got the right. One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck. One man's meat is someone's empty well. One man's meat is some guy's aching butt. One man's meat is another man's living hell.
one more rainy day,"(Lord/Evans). Changes, visible changes. Sky looking so forlorn. It looks like the world's been born. On one more rainy day. Trying to see the sunlight. My heart's crying out loud. I try to see through the clouds. On one more rainy day. One more rainy day. Once again my mind is grey. This is what a rainy day can do. One more rainy day. One more rainy day. Sun starts shining on through. New day a day with you. It's strange what sun can do. On one more rainy day. One more rainy day. Once again my mind is grey. This is what a rainy day can do. One more rainy day. One more rainy day."
one night in vegas,"Ooh what a night it was, the night I fell apart. I begged a lover not to go away. but she went and broke my heart. I found myself in a Vegas bar with a whole new set of friends. Seen through the bottom of an empty glass. Like looking through a fisheye lens. One night in Vegas. It was a morning of revenge for what I did the night before. Which accompanied me to the following day. to even up the score. In a stone cold sober mood next afternoon at ten. I found my tongue back in my mouth. And I told myself not to drink again. One night in Vegas. I was three sheets to the wind. The three shots did me in. Three angels there above me. As I was lying on the floor. I knew I should have run for the hills. But I still wanted more. I don't remember the chapel but I woke up with a wife. I looked at her, she looked at me. and now we're hooked for life. How strange the situation, it's now been thirty years. Since I met that girl in Vegas. And would you believe it, she's still here. One night in Vegas. Oh yeah I gotta tell you, one night in Vegas"
our lady,"Thinking out of line just to make the sun shine. Anyway I can be like you. Fighting with the truth. Trying to hide a fool in a fantasy. I'm dreaming, lay me down and take me now. Our Lady of the skies. Hiding in the sun like a loaded gun reality. Aiming high at my dream. But I can get along. She makes me strong, anyway. I'm dreaming and there is no other way. Our Lady of the skies. Flying in the sky with a bunch of high fidelity. I can hear your song. Offer me a ring just to show me your sincerity. I'm dreaming, let me go. Our Lady of the skies."
out of hand,"Shiny silver faces, coloured paper falling into their hand. Never to be seen again it must have been a one night stand. Up until the dawn I could have sworn. That everything was alright. Thieving bastards stole my life. And legged it off into the night. It's a dirty business it's a dirty game. Everybody different but they're all the same. They draw you in you hear a siren call. Build you up so they can see you fall. You've seen it all before. Been there since time began. You know what's coming next. Everything gets out of hand. They've got the lot and god knows.

paint it black,"I see a red door and. I want to paint it black. No colors anymore. I want them to turn black. I see the girls walk by dressed. In their summer clothes. I have to turn my head. Until my darkness goes. I see a line of cars. And they're all painted black. With flowers and my love. Both never to come back. I see people turn their heads. And quickly look away. Like a new born baby. It just happens ev'ry day. I look inside myself. And see my heart is black. I see my red door. And it has been painted black. Maybe then I'll fade away. And not have to face the facts. It's not easy facin' up. When your whole world is black. No more will my green sea. Go turn a deeper blue. I could not foresee. This thing happening to you. If I look hard enough. Into the settin' sun. My love will laugh with me. Before the mornin' comes. I see a red door and. I want to paint it black. No colors anymore. I want them to turn black.

painted horse,"(Blackmore/Gillan/Glover/Lord/Paice). Child on a painted horse. Streams that will run their course. Gone to a far away shore. Ooh, ooh, ah. My painted horse is weeping. Days of another kind. Frost gets a bruising vine. Why did the carpenter die. Ooh, ooh, ah. My painted horse is weeping. Sweet as a rose so fine. Peaceful as a final time. How old could the lion man cry. Ooh, ooh, ah. My painted horse is weeping. Thoughts of a winter moon. Warm in a distant room. Why did I fall asleep so soon. Ooh, ooh, ah. My painted horse is weeping."
perfect strangers,"Can you remember remember my name. As I flow through your life. A thousand oceans I have flown. And cold, cold spirits of ice. All my life. I am the echo of your past. I am returning the echo of a point in time. Distant faces shine. A thousand warriors I have known. And laughing as the spirits appear. All your life. Shadows of another day. And if you hear me talking on the wind. You've got to understand. We must remain. Perfect Strangers. I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow. A strand of silver hanging through the sky. Touching more than you see. The voice of ages in your mind. Is aching with the dead of the night. Precious life your tears are lost in falling rain. And if you hear me talking on the wind. You've got to understand. We must remain. Perfect Strangers"
picture of innocence,"I hear they're trying to make us all the same. It's mind control by any other name. Who's gonna pay the price. For this foolish paradise. OhÃ¥ÅÂ¨omma don't take that train. I hear it said we're headed too far south. Chinese whispers go by word of mouth. Rules for every size and shape. The nag has gone, shut the gate. Once you're in you're never getting out. I'm so misunderstood. There goes my manlihood. She's in my face again. With that picture of innocence. No drinks, No smokes. No dicking around. No dirty jokes. Straight lace, straight face. The old straight jacket. We got no hope. I hear they're gonna try out something new. I can feel it sticking to my shoe. So this is what tomorrow holds. Hopes and dreams are bought and sold. But still the world is misty green and blue. I', so misunderstood. There goes my mannish boyhood. She's in my face again. With that picture of innocence. No deals, No strokes. No forbidden fruit. No holy smoke. What next, no sex. That's the end of the road. That's the end of the road. We got no hope. No drinks, No smokes. No dicking around. No dirty jokes. Straight lace, straight face. The old straight jacket. We got no hope. No deals, No strokes. No forbidden fruit. No holy smoke. What next, no sex. That's the end of the road. We got no hope."

pictures of home,Somebody's shouting. Up at a mountain. Only my own words return. Nobody's up there. It's a deception. When will I ever learn?. CHORUS:. I'm alone here. With emptiness eagles and snow. Unfriendliness chilling my body. And whispering pictures of home. Wondering blindly. How can they find me. Maybe they don't even know. My body is shaking. Anticipating. The call of the black footed crow.... Chorus. I'm alone here. With emptiness eagles and snow. Unfriendliness chilling my body. And whispering pictures of home. Here in this prison. Of my own making. Year after day I have grown. Into a hero. But there's no worship. Where have they hidden my thrown.... Chorus. I'm alone here. With emptiness eagles and snow.

place in line,"I'm living in this line. I know my place, could think of no way. Of edging along in a loser's race. The line was moving slowly. Day by night. Everybody's shuffling on to keep a place in the line. Nine long years I've been in line. Getting nowhere there is no reason. For this line I don't care.. Everybody's standing in the burning sun. Everybody's shuffling on keeping a place in the line. Don't you think we're gonna make it. We've got a place in line. We're gonna make it some time. Somehow."
purpendicular waltz,:: Solo de Gaita ::. Put your money down. Take your choice. Thatâs the way it is. Every time with these boys. And you sense no shame. And you feel no disgrace. Somebody wins. Somebody loses. Itâs a dirty dirty race. Oh my life. Itâs a dogâs life. One empty monday. Out of the blue. Took a good luck turn. Started something new. Out of the gutter. Out of the rain. Out of my head. And Iâm feeling no pain. Oh my life/feeling no pain. Take the strain. Itâs a dogâs life. Ducking in the shadows. Diving in the dark. Rolling with the punches. Striking at the heart. Touching all the senseâs. Breaking those taboos. Bursting at the seams. Blowing all my fuses. The turning of a page. The burning of a book. (if youâre) talking out of turn. (itâs) just the way you look. When the time is right. But the shape is wrong. And you find yourself. Where you donât belong. Back to reality. Back on the line. Back into this and youâll feel no pain. You wanna do it one more time. We can do it once again. Oh my life. Itâs a dogâs life. By Manta
ramshackle man,My clothes don't fit and I have no point of view. I got a bad reputation but I don't believe it's true. I had something going but I blew it down the can. Not exactly what I planned. I'm a ramshackle man. That's what I am. I look like a joker but I feel like a one eyed jack. Shuffling around never get to the top of the park. I said to the dealer put the ace in my hand. But he couldn't give a damn. I'm a ramshackle man. That's what I am. I sit down thinking bout the things I have to do. I start out fine then I pick up something new. Stumbled through the door that's how it all began. Now it's buried in the sand. I'm a ramshackle man. That's what I am. The stars shine bright when the boys come out to play. Never feeling more than I'm feeling right here today. I used to be fresh but now I'm second hand. I do what I can. I'm a ramshackle man. That's what I am.

seventh heaven,"I've been to places where the sun goes down. Each day and never rises. I've been to places in a dark room. Where we played with our disguises. Heaven, I'm in heaven. I'm in seventh heaven now. Seventh heaven. It was a dream, I heard a voice. I put it down to wishful thinking. It was a dream, a silent scream. Out of the blue, a new beginning. Heaven, I'm in heaven. I'm in seventh heaven now. Seventh heaven. And then I fell upon a stroke of luck. That led to my good fortune. And then I fell upon my knees. And gently kissed the ground you walk on. Heaven, I'm in heaven. I'm in seventh heaven now. Seventh heaven."

When night falls again I wait for love to be there. Shadows can't conceal you. You can't hide, so please don't try. Your life and my love. But to search just makes me cry. Then in the shadows I see the face I look for. But then like the night you're gone just as before. A face in a crowd. A shadow once more. Shadows can't conceal you. You can't hide, so please don't try. Your life and my love. But to search just makes me cry. Shadows can't conceal you. You can't hide, so please don't try. Your life and my love.

shield,"(Lord/Blackmore/Evans). Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream. While the children play in the field. Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life. But how strong is the shield?. Can peace be found on the carpet above ground. Where sky is forever blue. So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud. Which may take me from you. Many things a man can lose. His self, his rights, his views. But never his heart or his love. So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb. To the hill up above. Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream. While our children play in the field. I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life. And trust in the strength of the shield. So trust in you love, and Lucy of above. And let light pass like a wheel. Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance. Kiss the strength of the shield. The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground. And to his wish he will yield. Fate will have it's word, of course [think this line is wrong...]. And time will change its course. And hold the strength of the shield."

Slow down sister. Well you're gonna find out there's trouble in paradise. ..that ain't nice.... You'll never stop party your butterfly ball. dressed in the black, if you think you've done it all.

smoke on the water,"We all came out to Montreaux. On the Lake Geneva shoreline. To make records with a mobile. We didn't have much time. Frank Zappa and the Mothers. Were at the best place around. But some stupid with a flare gun. Burned the place to the ground. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water. They burned down the gambling house. It died with an awful sound. Funky Claude was running in and out. Pulling kids out the ground. When it all was over. We had to find another place. But Swiss time was running out. It seemed that we would lose the race. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water. We ended up at the Grand Hotel. It was empty, cold and bare. But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside. Making our music there. With a few red lights and a few old beds. We made a place to sweat. No matter what we get out of this. I know, I know we'll never forget. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water"

I think you're crazy, your two-timing ways. They don't bother me none. You'd better do it right because one day or night. I'm gonna walk to freedom. You know I loved you once and I wanna love again. But you don't give nothing. You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize. Baby, I ain't bluffing. Black suede, don't waste your time on me. Black suede, don't bring me misery. I tried to be inside of you. But you're black and now I know what to do. You're a smooth dancer. But it's alright. Cos I'm a freelancer. And I can tell you're faking though you try. To make me think you're magical. Baby, you're the one who can never see the sun. Bacause it don't shine nightly. Don't you look at me because I'm gonna shake free. You'd better hang on tightly. You know I loved you once and I wanna love again. But you don't give nothing. You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize. Baby, I ain't bluffing. Baby, you can rock'n'roll. But you can never show your soul, smooth dancer."
soldier of fortune,"I have often told you stories about the way. I lived the life of a drifter waiting for the day. When I'd take your hand and sing you songs. And may be you would say. Come lay with me and love me. And I would surely stay. But I feel I'm growing older. And the songs that I have sung. Echo in the distance. Like the sound. Of a windmill going round. Guess I'll always be. A soldier of fortune. Many times I've been a traveller. I looked for something new. In days of old when nights were cold. I wandered without you. Those days I thought my eyes. Had seen you standing near. Though blindness is confusing. It shows that you're not here. Now I feel I'm growing older. And the songs that I have sung. Echo in the distance. Like the sound. Of a windmill going round. Guess I'll always be. A soldier of fortune. Yes, I can hear the sound. Of a windmill going round. I guess I'll always be. A soldier of fortune. I guess I'll always be.

solitaire,Door. Don't close the door. I want to feel the cold. I want to see the light. Momma where you gone. This is no dream. Can't make it right if it's wrong. Dancing with strangers. Fighting with friends. It's a matter of time between love and despair. Falling over the line. Empty hearts and icy stares. Call me Solitaire. The eyes. In the face on the wall. Follow me round the room. Follow me everywhere. A heart without an echo. A man without a child. Alone with all my sorrow. Dancing with strangers. Fighting with friends. It's a matter of time between love and despair. Falling over the line. Empty hearts and icy stares. Call me Solitaire
somebody stole my guitar,Remind me to tell you. bout the old silver miner. name of hard rock Pete. had his house built on a slope. They say one of his legs. lived in Calico. Ther's a rumour going round. that the other lived in hope. So I walked in the room. and I stopped. I turned around. and looked over my shoulder. And a voice close beside me said. You'd better watch your head. the party's over. It wasn't long before. the waitress came over and said. Can I freshen up your drink. and have you heard of these boys. and if you feel included. to buy some cowboy boots. Well it's not that bad. we can talk above the noise. So I sucked on my beer. Shut my eyes. and tried to listen to the words. I know I missed the meaning. but the message. was something I'd already heard. Johnny Ringo's voice. is getting deeper. and now he's going to put. another lock on the door. The night is getting later. My head is getting lighter. The mood is getting darker. Tequila's being poured. So I smile. at the old gunslinger. in his frame on the wall. as he pushed back his hat. And it's all coming back. I'd cut a long story short. but it's much too late for that. Somebody stole my guitar. They took it from. the back seat of my car. I was sleeping in Memphis. in my hotel room. and somebody stole my guitar.
sometimes i feel like screaming,While you were out.... The message says. You left a number. And I tried to call. But they wrote it down. In a perfect spanish scrawl. In a perfect spanish scrawl. Yet again. I'm missing you. King size bed. (in a) hotel someplace. I hear your name. I see your face. I see your face. (the) back street dolls. And the side door johnnies. The wide eyed boys with their bags full of. Money. Back in the alley. Going bang to the wall. Tied to the tail. Of a midnight crawl. Heaven wouldn't be. So high I know. If the times gone by. Hadn't been so low. The best laid plans. Come apart at the seams. And shatter all my dreams. Sometimes I feel like.... Screaming. Close my eyes. It's times like this. My head goes down. And the only thing I know. Is the name of this town. Is the name of this town. Yet again. I'm missing you. Won't be long. I'm coming home. Until that distant time. I'll be moving on. I'll be moving on

ted the mechanic,"Playing pool and drinking beer. Nothin more'n the. occasional tear. But this man's life goes on. and he gets. greased all over. from time to time. At the strip joint, where we met. He said 'Hi, my name is Ted. See that one over there. That ball of thunder. Every time she goes Vavoom,. I wiggle in my chair. Can I buy you a beer?. What a guy. 'I've had a few myself' he said. 'But I never quit when I'm ahead. Too many rules and regulations. Stupid laws designed by fools behind closed doors. And another thing I won't discuss is religion. It always causes a fight. Vavoom. There she goes again. 'How does she do that' said Ted. And he told me. of those unjustices (that). He had suffered in his life. His wife and kids. and boss and dogs. and neighbours. Raising cain and causing strife. They were forever whining. Bleating howling yapping screeching moaning crying. Vavoom. He fed them well. He keep them warm. Thing about Ted. he didn't really care. Nothing much got in his hair. and the beauty of it was. that he was right. He was big as a truck. and fast as a door. (what's that?). he was always right. The banjo player took a hike.

the aviator,"Riding on the moonpath. in the silver of the night. The fragrance on the air. was of another time. I cried in all my innocence. you were dressed in white. and even if I'd had the strength. I couldn't move to save my life. The fear and the thrill. of the beast at the window. The shivers and the chills. on the hottest of nights. he walked right through. my open door. As I began to run, he threw. some gold upon the floor, and said. There's plenty more. where that came from. I'm tired of the bombs. I'm tired of the bullets. I'm tired of the crazies on TV. I'm the aviator. A dream's a dream whatever it seems. I flew along the lighted street. I flew above the town. I flew in ever rising cicrcles. ever further from the ground. As I begin to lose my breath. printed faxes turn a spin. A distant corner of the room. will open up and let me in. I'm tired of the news. I'm tired of the weather. I'm tired of the same thing every day. I'm the aviator. A dream's a dream whatever they say."
the battle rages on,Been so many words so much to say. Words are not enough to keep the guns at bay. Some live in fear some do not. Some gamble everything on who gets the final shot. Oh don't talk to me of love. It's obvious it's not enough. Annihilation kill them all. Capitulation watch the mighty fall. The road to glory is lined in red. And though the reason now is gone. The battle rages on. Was it love or hate that got here first. Hate's a habit it's hard to shake the curse. Kill to live and live to die. Human nature you let the strong survive. Oh don't talk to me of love. Be serious it's not enough. Annihilation kill them all. Capitulation watch the mighty fall. The road to glory is lined in red. And trough the reason now is gone. The battle rages on.

the surprising,"It wasn't quite the curse of Tutankhamen. Or the kiss of death from Judas in the night. And it felt so far beyond the blue horizon. Tempting me with transports of delight. And when the devil took my hand and said. Come along with me. There I was, wide awake and dreaming. Reaching out for something in the sky. But I could not control that trembling feeling. Everything I want is slipping by. And when the devil took my hand and said. Something you should see. I never knew what happened to my nightmare. Everything went dark that August day. And the eclipse was on the other side of somewhere. But I was on the upside of afraid. And then an angel took my hand and said. Come along with me"

things i never said,"Don't get me started, let's get it right. There's no use to talk about it deep into the night. Don't ask about secrets I could tell. I'm gonna keep them to myself. No bad decisions, no good advice. No time to think about it even once or twice. No second chances looking down the road. When there's the only way, only way to go. Oh it makes me wonder. What's going on inside my head. Well could it be the pressure that I'm under. Makes me forget the things I never said. I can't remember, I can't forget. Take it from me there's not a moment of regret. Since the day I learned to tie my shoes. I found it hard to spread the news. Oh it makes me wonder. What's going on inside my head. Well could it be the pressure that I'm under. Makes me forget the things I never said. It's hard to swallow, it's hard to take. When I think about it now my knees begin to shake. Never came to me to mention at the time. Tell the truth it never crossed my mind. Oh it makes me wonder. What's going on inside my head. Well could it be the pressure that I'm under. Makes me forget the things I never said. Oh it makes me wonder. What's going on inside my head. Could it be the pressure that I'm under. Makes me forget the things I never said"

time for bedlam,"""Descending the cold steps of the institution. For the politically insane. Never to be seen again. Saying farewell to daylight. From henceforth I shall rot. In a stinking bed of wet straw"". Right from the ashes of life. I learned to behave. What to believe. What not to say. From cradle to grave. Ah... Like a good little slave. Sucking my milk. From the venomous tit of the State. Clearly designed to suppress. Every thought of escape. Ah... I surrender to fate. No pity no pity. Don't want no pity for me. In this filthy cell. I see you in hell. Frozen in time. I'm a specimen pinned to my throne. With an army of butterflies. Pilloried placid and prone. Ah... We were never alone. No pity no pity. Don't no pity for me. In this filthy cell. I see you in hell. ""After centuries of living. With nothing but my convictions. Broken fingers clawing through. The walls of my incarceration. Escaping the clutches of eternal damnation. I was justified"""
time to kill,Consider your position position your defense. Why don't you let me ask you is it mere coincidence. Feeding speculators on a downhill gravy train. Like vultures ripping out the eyes to reach the dying brain. Listen to the wind - a silent scream. Tearing at your broken heart. Like a forgotten dream. And there's a time for peace a time for war. Wondering what we've been put here for. A time for giving a time to take. A time for love and a time for hate. A time for beg and a time to steal. So you gamble on that spinning wheel. Of all these things I've had my fill. Lord I need some time to kill. Ten percent of nothing is exactly what you got. You thing you've got the given right to take another shot. I'll take away your money all you've got is coloured beads. Find a piece of land where you can sow your seeds. Listen to the wind - a silent scream. Tearing at your broken heart. Like a forgotten dream. There's a time for passion a time for pain. A time to learn that we're all the same. A time to remember a time to forget. Wondering how we're going to pay our debts. A time for thunder a time for rain. Waiting for the seasons to change. Of all these things I've had my fill. Lord I need some time to kill.
too much is not enough,"(Turner, Held, Greenwood) 4.19. You're so extreme, you're super heavy. You're one step over the line. Not what you seem, don't try and tell me. I know what's really on your mind. Once you get started you're out of control. Don't play that sweet and innocent with me girl. I know you know you want to rock and roll. But I got just what you need. I, I want to feel your love. Too much is not enough. I, I want to feel your touch. Too much is not enough. You've got it bad, you're hopelessly addicted. You're always searching for the cure. Love is the crime, you stand convicted. You keep on coming back for more. Come on admit it, you're over the top. That song and dance won't work with me girl. You just can't quit it, don't know when to stop. But I got the remedy. I, I want to feel your love. Too much is not enough. I, I want to feel your touch. Too much is not enough. Baby stop wasting time. And let me know that you're mine. I need to feel your embrace. How much can I take."
truth hurts,"(Blackmore/Glover/Turner) 5.14. You know my will is broken. You've got my heart on hold. I'm lying here in pieces, so cold. It gets so hard to handle. All the things you need to say. But I guess I heard it all before anyway. Is love such a blessing or a curse. Either way. Truth hurts. Well there'll be no more running. Now I've got you face to face. I want to know who you've been loving in my place. You say I had it coming. Try to hold my head up high. Love gave me wings and left me paralyzed. There's nothing left alive. As we watch the spirits die. The world keeps turning. My heart keeps learning. Do you know where the guilty sleep. Babe I've got my pride. Somehow I will survive. The world keeps turning. My heart keeps learning. Do you know where the lonely sleep tonight. Another fallen angel. How far I just can't tell. Living without love is a living hell. Why is love such a blessing or a curse. Baby either way. Truth hurts. Babe I've got my pride. Somehow I will survive. My heart keeps learning. Don't know which is worse. But one thing that I know. Truth hurts."
uncommon man,"Our days fall together in time. You said you can't have it all. Beast and the broom, I have that kind of feeling. It's got to be twenty foot tall. But the man. Is still alive.

It's good to be king. It's good to be king. By the way. The carriage is waiting. To take yo away. If you let all the fear right in. We'd never betray you. Believe what you see.

Realise I've never lost and never won. I've got a feeling that it's never right. There was a reason but it's out of sight. It's going down somewhere tonight. Under the gun. Put death in my hand. Learn to fight. Who could care if it's wrong or if it's right. We got no choice. Under command. We're ordered to die or take this land. Stupid bastards and religious freaks. So safe in their castle keeps. They turn away as a mother weeps. Under the gun. When brave men fall. Under crimson skies. There's a sadness reflected in a soldier's. eyes. Tears will dry. For those I kill. Remember no more their names but. someone will. The only way to be victorious. Screw the fools who think it's glorious. Who gives a toss about the likes of us. Under the gun.
vavoom: ted the mechanic,"Playing pool and drinking beer. Nothin more'n the. occasional tear. But this man's life goes on. and he gets. greased all over. from time to time. At the strip joint, where we met. He said 'Hi, my name is Ted. See that one over there. That ball of thunder. Every time she goes Vavoom,. I wiggle in my chair. Can I buy you a beer?. What a guy. 'I've had a few myself' he said. 'But I never quit when I'm ahead. Too many rules and regulations. Stupid laws designed by fools behind closed doors. And another thing I won't discuss is religion. It always causes a fight. Vavoom. There she goes again. 'How does she do that' said Ted. And he told me. of those unjustices (that). He had suffered in his life. His wife and kids. and boss and dogs. and neighbours. Raising cain and causing strife. They were forever whining. Bleating howling yapping screeching moaning crying. Vavoom. He fed them well. He keep them warm. Thing about Ted. he didn't really care. Nothing much got in his hair. and the beauty of it was. that he was right. He was big as a truck. and fast as a door. (what's that?). he was always right. The banjo player took a hike. What's that song. I used to like. Vavoom. He was big as a truck. Fast as a door - Ted. Ted the man our Ted."
vincent price,"Lightning flashing on a heavy iron gate. Scares me to death but I just can't wait. Deep in the dungeon there's a rattling of chains. Mad dr. Phibes gonna eat my brains. It feels so good to be afraid. Vincent price is back again. The heart pumping louder. The music's out of time. The vampire's dying. He's got to have wine. Red blood dripping, she doesn't have a prayer. I know it's not real but I just don't care. It feels so good to be afraid. Vincent price is back again. I want seven screaming virgins on a sacrificial altar. Howling dogs, creaking doors and zombies to die for"
wait a while,"Wait before you go,. So you will know, what I am feeling as you leave. I understand, your need for some time. Some solitude. Wait a while, before you go.

wasted sunsets,"the day is gone when the angels come to stay. and all the silent whispers will be blown away. lying in the corner, a pair of high-heel shoes. hanging on the wall, gold and silver for the blues. one too many wasted sunsets. one too many for the road. and after dark, the door is always open. hopin' someone else will show. someone is waiting behind an unlocked door. grey circle's overhead, empty's on the floor. the cracks in the walls have grown too long. the slow hand is dragging on, afraid to meet the dawn. one too many wasted sunsets. one too many for the road. and after dark, the door is always open. hopin' someone else will show."
watching the sky,"I sit here alone. I sit here alone. I look at the walls. Look at the walls. Look at the walls. I look at the walls. You shouldn't be out on your own. Oh no not with a condition like that. Oh no sir constant care. A condition like that, a condition so rare. A penny for the guy, a penny for your thoughts. One a penny, two a penny in your pocket. Ding dong bell, who can tell. Wild Man Fisher got nothing on me. I sit by the water. I sit by the water. Watch it go by. Clouds going by. I'm watching the sky. I left my luggage at the station. Didn't know how to say goodbye. I walked away from all the fury. And the madness and the fury. And the madness and the fury. And the madness. I smile to myself. I smile to myself. You're on the blind side, I'm on the other side. Now I'm on the outside looking for another side. Upside down side, I'm still lucid. I may be crazy but I'm not stupid. Try to get out, the parking lot's full. No matter, no matter, what's a man going to do. One two buckle my shoe. Zip my lip."
we can work it out,(Lennon/McCartney). Try to see it my way. Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go wrong. While you see it your way. Run the risk of knowing that our love will soon be gone. We can work it out. We can work it out. Think of what you're saying. You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright. Think of what I'm saying. We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight. We can work it out. We can work it out. Life is very short and there's no time. For fussing and fighting my friend. I have always thought that it's a crime. So I will ask you once again. I'll ask you once again. Try to see it my way. Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. While I see it your way.

weirdistan,"We travel through time and meet on a stretch of sand. You're from up north and I live in wonderland. Dear neighbour of mine we're centuries, light years apart. You carry no flame but you're visible in the dark. Way across the border all those people waving flags. Sending me encouragement but I can't move. Something holds me back. The man in the moon is looking the other way. And while he's distracted we turn to another page. No question of guilt, it seems like we're just out of sync. You do what you will and I'll do what I think. Imagine when you wake up. scratch your head, and everything's changed. Nothing's where you left it. your normality's been rearranged. It's beautiful. Oh yeah, it's beautiful. Leave our skin as we merge into one. O yeah, it's beautiful. It's beautiful. Beautiful"

What's goin onhere?. Went downtown, had a long way to go.. How I got there, well, I don't know.. Found myself sittin' in a west side bar,. tried to leave but I could not go far.. High class woman try'n to give me a line,. should have left early when I felt so fine.. I can't stay here, there's something wrong here.. What's goin' on here?.

whatsername,"Unforgettable face, I can't think of her name. It's on the edge of my tongue, gathering dust in the back of my brain. Something 'bout the way she ignores me that's vaguely familiar. Makes you wonder what it was you ever did to thrill her. Here we go again. Here we go again. Here I go again. I never felt the need to soothe her savage breast. She never felt obliged to tell me of her change of address. Caught me on a downward swing but I fell through her arms. How could I be so careless, I never meant to go so far. Here we go again. Here we go again. Here I go again. Oh she's back in town. Oh she's back in town. I'm not leaving. I'm running away. She took it all away, now she's back for the rest. Took it all so easy, wouldn't settle for less. She doesn't know what she wants but she knows how to get it. I can't remember the time, she never let me forget it. Here we go again. Here we go again. Here I go again. Oh Whatsername's back in town. She's back in town. I'm not leaving. I'm running away. Oh she's back in town. Oh she's back in town. I'm not leaving. I'm running away."
when a blind man cries,"If you're leaving close the door.. I'm not expecting people anymore.. Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.. Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.. I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.. That's when a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.. Had a friend once in a room,. had a good time but it ended much too soon.. In a cold month in that room. we found a reason for the things we had to do.. I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.. That's when a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul."
why didn't rosemary,"There's a black hill. We had a climb. Everything I need but nothing's mine. Satan's world, I've had a kill. Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill?. Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill. Oh man won't do it, but the devil will. I'm losing time and my mind. Why can't I ever have what's naturally mine?. I got life and the things that go with it. If there's something else, where can i get it?. Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill. Oh man won't do it, but the devil will. Well here's my views, I always lose. Things I want to do are yesterday's news. Say life's a ball, I've had it all. Out there in another dance hall. Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill. Oh man won't do it, but the devil will. Take me as I am, an excuse for a man. Wherever I push someone stops my hand. As a matter of interest, tell me if you will. Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill?. Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill. Oh man won't do it, but the devil will. Oh, why won't Rosemary ever take the pill?"

She's so good to me. But I'm at home and I just don't belong .... So far away from the garden we love. She is what moves in the soul of a dove. Soon I shall see just how black was my night.

My woman from Tokyo. She's so good to me."
wrong man,"I wasn't in the room when the action was going down. I may have been there once but at the time I was out of town. I'm seeing strange fruit, they're saying off with his head. One way or another I'll end up dead. You got the wrong man. You don't understand. You got the wrong man. You got the wrong man. I do what I can.

you can't do it right (with the one you love),"(Blackmore/Coverdale/Hughes). Have you ever thought of the feeling. I get when I'm alone with you. It's causing me worry and trouble. I'm going 'round in circles. Don't know what I'm gonna do. You can't do it right. With the one you love. Nothing you can do. Without the one you love. You were always playing my records. When I was after making some love. But I need more than the music. To keep myself together. Although it makes me feel so good. You can't do it right. With the one you love. Nothing you can do. Without the one you love. Sometimes in the morning. I wake up without you. Can't get up, it's getting me down. Tell me what you're trying to do. Later in the evening. You come home feeling low. If you'd stop your cruising. Maybe we could make a show. You can't do it right. With the one you love. Nothing you can do. Without the one you love. ."
