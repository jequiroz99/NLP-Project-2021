'Cause they were alive when you spoke to me. Broken the skies and my empathy. American eyes so close to me. Will we ever come again?. A heavy load and a fucked up system. You're on your own with all your instance. All you see is all you get. Surfing on the waves of promises. Mine out of time she wrote to me. American eyes so close to me. American eyes so close to me. American eyes. Will you ever come again?. Will you ever come again?. American eyes....

Adrenaline keeps me in the game. Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain. Wilder than your wildest dreams. When you're going to extremes. It takes adrenaline. Run through the speed of sound. Every thing slows you down. And all color that surrounds you. Are bleeding to the walls. All the things you really need. Just wait to find the speed. Then you will achieve. Escape velocity. Too much is not enough. Nobody gave it up. I'm not the kind. To lay down and die. Adrenaline keeps me in the game. Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain. Wilder than your wildest dreams. When you're going to extremes. It takes adrenaline. Adrenaline. Screaming out your name. Adrenaline. You don't even feel the pain. Wilder than your wildest dreams. When you're going to extremes. It takes adrenaline. (Adrenaline). You don't even feel the pain. You don't even feel the pain. I'm going to extremes. There is nothing in between. You don't even feel the pain. You don't even feel the pain. You don't even feel the pain. You don't even feel the pain

Don’t lie till you’re done. Dive in. Dive into everything. You could say that all love breaks you. And every kiss is who you are. See yourself through the mirror of the signs. It’s alright to lose your mind. In a world of paradise. Yesterday before your eyes. And all the lives you leave behind. In a world of paradise. Watch them fade in the shadow of the sun. Each new day the last is done

the only way out,Follow me down to the water. Through the tripwires in your head. Through the seven layers. Of your holy bed. Where there is no one god. But a series of systems. I want to be your savior. I want to be your seasons. The only way out is through. Lost my mind over you. The only way out is through. Lost my mind over you. Follow me down to the freeway. Where the beat goes on. And a heatwave blast the night. Say what you will but we pray. To the gods of our own demise. All the time. The only way out is through. Lost my mind over you. The only way out is through. Lost my mind over you. Let's build a bonfire tonight. We'll stay warm in the nighttime. Warm in the nighttime. Follow me down to the water. Through the tripwires in your head. Through the seven layers. Of your holy bed. Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh. The only way out is through. Lost my mind over you. The only way out is through. Lost my mind over you. The only way out. The only way out. The only way out is through. Lost my mind over you
the people that we love,Speed kills coming down the mountain. Speed kills coming down the street. Speed kills with presence of mind and. Speed kills if you know what I mean. Got to feel woke up inside again. Got to feel less broke more fixed. Got to feel when I got outside myself. Got to feel when I touched your lips. The things we do to the people that we love. The way we break if there's something we can't take. Destroy the world that we took so long to make. We expect her gone for some time. I wish her safe from harm. To find yourself in a foreign land. Another refugee outsider refugee. How's it feel she's coming up roses. How's it feel she's coming up sweet. How's it feel when it's all in spite of you. How's it feel when she's out of your reach. The things we do to the people that we love. The way we break if there's something in the way. Destroy the world that we took so long to make. We expect her gone for some time - I wish her safe from harm. To find yourself in a foreign land. Another refugee outsider refugee. What happened to you (4). The things we do to the people that we love. The things we do to the people that we love. The things we do to the people that we love. The things we do to the people that we love.
the sound of winter,"Mind strong, body strong. Try to find equilibrium. Head straight, screwed on. Been screwed up for too long. I don't want to lean on the waves. I watch the storm evaporate. I think of you in starry skies. I keep you so alive. Let's walk through the fire together. Disappear in the golden sands. It's all in your face. I see you break. It's like the sound of winter. The bleeding love, the silent escape. You've got to hang on to yourself. It's like the sound of winter. Medusa smiles, judas lips. Open arms and finger tips. Love bites and recompense. I'll be with you until the end. Let's walk through the fire together. Disappear in the golden sands. It's all in your face. I see you break. It's like the sound of winter. The bleeding love, the silent escape. You've got to hang on to yourself. All in your face. I see you break. It's like the sound of winter. The bleeding love, the silent escape. You've got to hang on to yourself. It's like the sound of winter. Hang on to yourself. Hang on to yourself. It's like the sound of winter. It's all in your face. I see you break.

warm machine,"I memorise the basics. Making strange faces. Tread slowly for I know. There's a thousand miles to go. Without blinking. Gravitate spacewards. Find a home for the head from my basement. No darkness ever left. This is the night ,this is the sound. Here comes the warm machine. Such a warm machine. Somedays are playful. Making play faces. But we will not let it through. The darkness and the sense. Of being born to lose. This is the life, this is the ground. Here comes the warm machine. Such a warm machine. If we never know we can only feel. I'll take the help I'll take a slice. Warm alright now cos I feel alright. I memorize the basics. This is the night, this is the sound. Here comes the warm machine"
wild horses,"Childhood living, its easy to do. Things that you wanted. I bought them for you. Graceless lady. You know who I am. You know I cant let you, slide through my hand. Wild horses couldn't drag me a way. Wild wild horses couldn't drag me a way. I watched you suffer a dull aching pain. Now you've decided to show me the same. Wild horses couldnt drag me away. Wild wild wild horses couldnt drag me away. I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie. I have my freedom but I don't have much time. Faith has been broken, tears must be cried. Let's do some living, and after we'll die. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild wild wild horses we will ride them some day.."
