good guys (feat. gabriel carson),"I have the power in my hands. I am brave, I am nervous. I'm scared because my life has changed. But the stars will stay with us. We are the good guys. We will help when you need. We have what you need. We will help you, we are your friends. We are the good guys. We are the good guys. I'm happy, I'm excited. Because I'm your dreamcatcher. I will help you, I'm powerful. But my power is for good. We are the good guys. We are the good guys. We will help, when you need. We have what you need. We will help you, you are so good. Inside. We are the good guys. We will help you, when you need. We have what you need. We will help you, we are your friends. We are the good guys. We will help you, when you need. We have what you need. We will help you, we are your friends. We are the good guys. We will help you, when you need. We have what you need. We will help you, we are your friends"
