fire away,"This one’s going out to you. As the taxi pulls away. A song to keep you company for the ride. There's something wrong with a goodbye. In the middle of the day. So pretend I am still sitting at your side. And if you want to talk about all the differences. Between the shackle and the man. Or if you’ve got reasons no one ever let you say. Then fire away. Fire away. This ones going out to you. On the day they let you out. For the thousand ways they ask if you're okay. Because whatever answer that you give. It’s only gonna play into their doubts. And be just half of what’s behind each word you say. So if you finally roped that heartbreak song. That the experts never could. Or if you just wanted someone to listen to you play. Then fire away. Fire away. Fire away. This ones going out to you. If you ever start to slip. And you learn to read between these lines you've Drawn. When what is wrong and what is right. Seem more like just the ocean and the ship. And the straight line that you've followed here is gone. And if that same old fox comes and sweeps you up. Each time you spread your wings. I could at least love you through each stumble, shift and sway. So fire away. Fire away. Fire away. When you need someone to walk away from. When you need someone to let you in. (Through each stumble, shift and sway)"
all your favorite bands,"Late night drives and hot french fries. And friends around the country. From charlottesville to good old santa fe. When I think of you, you still got on. That hat that says let's party. I hope that thing is never thrown away. I hope that life without a chaperone. Is what you thought it'd be. I hope your brother's el camino runs forever. I hope the world sees the same person. That you've always been to me. And may all your favorite bands stay together. Now I'm just waking up and 'm not thinking clearly. So don't quote me. Of what I hope when I'm writing you this song. Ain't it funny how some people pop into your head so easily. I haven't seen you in there for so long. I hope that life without a chaperone. Is what you thought it'd be. I hope your brother's el camino runs forever. I hope the world sees the same person. That you always were to me. And may all your favorite bands stay together. [x2]"
give me time,"Here we go.... Give me time..... Give me time..... If there's one thing you could give,. To help me show you all that's mine,. Give me time.. Show me love..... Show me love..... If there's one thing that you know,. That I've not had any of,. Show me love.. Help me see..... Help me see..... If you know what it would take. And find the patience that you need,. Help me see.. Give me time..... Give me time..... If there's one thing you could give,. To help me show you all that's mine,. Give me time."
when you call my name,"If all my lovers sing the big words. And all my brothers keep them small. Then I get lost in the difference, between their whisper and the echo of their call. So I am headed for the ocean,. to let the sea-smoke guide me in.. I'll give up my belongings and questions,. they only ever taught me to begin.. So I will not turn around,. as I step up to the train,. But I'll hear it when you call my name.. And I will not be the sound,. of your roof under the rain,. But I'll hear it when you call my name.. So I am taking off my wrist watch,. to let the time move how I please.. To let my day be guided by the sunlight,. Through mornings knell and twilights soft release. So if you want to get to know me,. follow my smile into it's curves. All these lines are born in sorrows and in pleasures,. and every man ends up with the face that he deserves.. So I will not give you bread,. As you reach out from your cage,. But I'll hear it when you call my name.. And I will not give applause,. as you step off of the stage,. But I'll hear it when you call my name.. There's a river running through the city. Gently reminding me what's what.. Of course, you are invited to come with me. But I don't think that's really what you want.. I think you want a world that will hold you,. Through security, and gravity, and love. And I can't think of anyone who'd blame you,. And I can't think of how that'd be enough.. So I won't come back around,. When you've cursed the ground you've tamed,. But I'll hear it when you call my name. And when you realize once I'm gone. That I never really came,. Oh, I'll hear it when you call my name.. And when the burden of the sun,. Reveals to you it's pain,. Oh, I'll hear it when you call my name.. And when you realize that you're wrong,. But you still give me all the blame,. I'll hear it when you call my name."
strangers getting stranger,"Did you hear the one about a joke without a punch-line. Or the song about a movie of a book. Like a stolen bouquet meant to be given away. To the girl that never gives you a look. Well that's how I've been spending all my meantime. Wondering if it's doing any harm. Resetting myself to when everything felt. Like a book I'm holding under my arm. But it's not that I want back all my innocence. Just the joy of losing it again. The favorites get their favors. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. The great one's all get greater. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. We got doctors that know everything about us. We can level cities by the end of the day. The world is turning back into dust or maybe it's just. We're becoming all the god's that we've praised. Or maybe the world is finally moving on without us. While we wait to see who's winning some debate. It's like we're running a race after spinning in place. We're pulling left when we've been moving straight. But me I think I'll keep on spinning. And smile as I hit the ground. The favorites get their favors. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. The great one's all get greater. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. Like a tree that doesn't look for it's root, it grows. Like a bird on the day that it's season is through, it knows. The favorites get their favors. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. The great one's all get greater. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday"
i can't think about it now,If you're just asking for a reason. Reasons are everywhere you look. The only difference between them. Are which you gave and which you took. Every smile with some dark anticipation. And dreams of back before it settled in their brows. I don't remember when you first began to notice. But I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. The latest singer's latest single's got me listening. For the pact between the writer and the star. This is how mythology is written. This is where the lawless jungles are. She's just a singer living mostly after midnight. Pumping blood and money back into a town. And it all eventually betrays her. But I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. So I guess it makes me wonder what I'm chasing. Like a dancer that's breaking in her shoes. Like sending men up to the moon just for the landing. Displaying power we don't know how else to use. Sometimes it's more than I can handle. Sometimes it's all the joy I've found. And it'll all end up on one side or the other. But I can't think about it now. The decades that are hidden in the sidewalks. The narrative that naturally occurs. The everlasting wisdom of a sports bar. The poison that's mistaken for a cure. All these backward glances putting me in danger. Of forgetting how to turn myself around. It's just that time just keeps on slipping through my fingers. But I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now. I can't think about it now
things happen,"I could go on talking or I could stop. Wring out each memory 'til I get every drop. Sift through the details of the others involved. The true crime would be thinking it's just one person's fault. Like an honest signature on a fake id. Like the guilty conscience with the innocent plea. You can just ignore it, put it out of mind. But ain't it funny how the past won't ever let something lie?. Let's make a list of all the things. the world has put you through. Let's raise a glass to all the people you're not speaking to. I don't know what else you wanted me to say to you. Things happen, that's all they ever do. In a different time, on a different floor. I might mourn the loss of who I'm not anymore. So I'm driving out to oakland for a good look back. And a few revisions to my plan of attack. Let's make a list of all the things. the world has put you through. Let's raise a glass to all the people you're not speaking to. I don't know what else you wanted me to say to you. Things happen, that's all they ever do. I think I'll see lilly. See where she stands. I can't help how I feel, I don't think anyone can. Sometimes we're lovers, sometimes we're friends. The hope of magnetism between two dead ends. Let's make a list of all the things. the world has put you through. Let's raise a glass to all the people you're not speaking to. I don't know what else you wanted me to say to you. Things happen, that's all they ever do. Or why a mom's compelled to bronze its baby's shoes. I don't know what else that you want me to say to you. Things happen, that's all they ever do. That's all they ever do. That's all they ever do. That's all they ever do"
all my failures,"Addressing a prayer into the air. And the shadows of lights. So nobody heard love's not for words. In a world at the end of it's night. For everyone that left me. They're so easy to forget. 'Cause I haven't let my failures hit me yet.. Your voice on the phone. The blood from the stone. And tears that I can't understand. As if I could heal the guilt I don't feel. Or by silently giving my hand. Well, I'm sure I'd never loved you. It'd be too fierce and too correct. 'Cause I haven't let my failures hit me yet. May my demon reveal itself tenderly. May he not leave me broken. May he leave me to be. So wherever I'm bound. My ear to the ground and my thoughts on their way back to you. As eternity's slave, you could write that on my grave. When I'm finished resisting it's true. While I'm shaking hands with darkness. It's with the warm wind that I admit. That I haven't let my failures hit me yet"

I hope the world sees the same person. That you've always been to me. And may all your favorite bands stay together. Now I'm just waking up and 'm not thinking clearly. So don't quote me. Of what I hope when I'm writing you this song. Ain't it funny how some people pop into your head so easily. I haven't seen you in there for so long. I hope that life without a chaperone.

bedside manner,"Some time as a much older man. I will sit down and put on this song.. It just might make me cry,. Or at the very least a tear in my eye.. I can't take all these years of my life. To be widdle down into a thought. That only appears to the year. I made memories perfectly clear.. Mama, mama. Mama, mama.. . I just want to be making my mind,. Keep from changing my mind not to change.. Cause I'm greedy as the sea,. And that's how it always will be.. I'll be somebody now, and I'll be somebody then,. And I'll be all of you all in between.. And then I'll be ready to leave. When the whole world is taken with me.. Mama, mama. Mama, mama.. Mama, mama. Mama, mama.. Cause there're so many days in a year.. And there's so many years in my head.. So I think about when I'll be dead,. And how those very last moments get spent.. And if I think about you is that something you think you'd accept?. Some time as a much older man. I will sit down and put on this song.. It just might make me cry,. Or at the very least a tear in my eye."
coming back to a man,You still wear your hair to your shoulder. You still look like a friday night. You're still caught somewhere between the plans and the dreams. So that neither end up turning out right. And i myself look a few moments older. When i learned that love is not as simple as i thought. It starts to feel more real and the wounds all start to heal. Whether i want them to or not. So tell me why you think i should forgive what you did. And ill tell you if i understand. Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid. But youre now coming back to a man. . It means a lot that you came here to speak to me. And i will listen in ways i never did before. I'll hear the pause between each word and when your presentations heard. Then i'll need to show you to the door. Cause some people were just meant to be a memory.. To be called upon to remind us how we've changed. The way the scattered ever-busy bright lights of a city. Might look off to a distant mountain range. And the guy you know is someone i work hard at keeping hid. And he is very good at sticking to the plan. Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid. But youre now coming back to a man. I might think of you more often then i'm willing to admit. But i cant show every card i'm holding in my hand. Cause you broke the quick-giving heart of a kid. But youre now coming back to a man

Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all.. So when I have lost all my control. God will rest my soul.. I guess your mind can leave your heart.. I guess that's what you're doing now..

Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all.. So when I have lost all my control. God will rest my soul.. And just like how I'll drink myself through my seventh relapse,.

Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall,. Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all.. So when I have lost all my control. God will rest my soul."

if i wanted someone,"Like the memory from your mother’s house from Before you got too old. Like the feeling from a photograph before it’s meanings all got told. The words I say can be silver, but what’s left unsaid can be gold. So get to know me once I go away. Maybe ‘cause I come from such an empty-hearted town. Or maybe ‘cause some love of mine had really let me down. But the only time I am lonely is when others are around. I just never end up knowing what to say. If I wanted someone to clean me up, I’d find myself a maid. If I wanted someone to spend my money, I wouldn’t need to get paid. If I wanted someone to understand me, I’d have so much more to say. I want you to make the days move easy. I took everything I thought from what it means to be a man. We need words to be put to what we do not understand. While you lean into the echoes and you do not raise a hand. Oh woman, help me see it like it is. If I wanted someone to clean me up, I’d find myself a maid.

If I wanted someone to clean me up, I’d find myself a maid. If I wanted someone to spend my money, I wouldn’t need to get paid. If I wanted someone to cut me down, I’d have handed you the blade.

If you let me be your anchor. I will hold you down.. If you let me be your anchor. I will hold you down.. If I see the thin trace of his hands. Let the winter pay all my dues. Let me forgive every single man. That before me came to you.. If you let me be your anchor. I will hold you down.. If you let me be your anchor. I will hold you down.. So find me when you welcome back your roots. And I will be where all of your ends meet.. I want the feeling waking next to you. I want to find my children at your feet.. If you let me be your anchor. I will hold you down.. If you let me be your anchor. I will hold you down.. oooohhhhhh. oooh oh oh oh oh oh. oooohhhhhh"
it's a little bit of everything,"With his back against the San Francisco traffic,. On the bridges side that faces towards the jail,. Setting out to join a demographic,. He hoists his first leg up over the rail.. And a phone call is made,. Police cars show up quickly.. The sergeant slams his passenger door.. He says, “Hey son why don’t you talk through this with me,. Just tell me what you’re doing it for.”. “Oh, it’s a little bit of everything,. It’s the mountains,. It’s the fog,. It’s the news at six o’clock,. It’s the death of my first dog,. It’s the angels up above me,. It’s the song that they don’t sing,. It’s a little bit of everything.”. An older man stands in a buffet line,. He is smiling and holding out his plate,. And the further he looks back into his timeline,. That hard road always had led him to today,. And making up for when his bright future had left him,. Making up for the fact that his only son is gone,. And letting everything out once, His server asks him,. Have you figured out yet, what it is you want?. I want a little bit of everything,. The biscuits and the beans,. Whatever helps me to forget about. The things that brought me to my knees,. So pile on those mashed potatoes,. And an extra chicken wing,. I’m having a little bit of everything.. Somewhere a pretty girl is writing invitations,. To a wedding she has scheduled for the fall,. Her man says, “Baby, can I make an observation?. You don’t seem to be having any fun at all.”. She said, “You just worry about your groomsmen and your shirt-size,. And rest assured that this is making me feel good,. I think that love is so much easier than you realize,. If you can give yourself to someone,. Then you should.. Cause it’s a little bit of everything,. The way you choke, the way you ache,. It is waking up before you,. So I can watch you as you wake.. So in the day in late September,. It’s not some stupid little ring,. I’m giving a little bit of everything.. Oh, it’s a little bit of everything,. It’s the matador and the bull,. It’s the suggested daily dosage,. It is the red moon when it’s full.. All these psychics and these doctors,. They’re all right and they’re all wrong,. It’s like trying to make out every word,. When they should simply hum along,. It’s not some message written in the dark,. Or some truth that no one’s seen,. It’s a little bit of everything."
love is all i am,"2, 3, 4.... I need a silent true-way to admire.. Like you as a sunset, and I as a wildfire.. And I can let the day go.... I've locked up these words, in fear that I'd say them wrong.. Is it love as a mountain, or love as a simple song?. And the moment that the two meet. has now laid itself at your feet.. And love is not convenient; it does not cease at your command.. You might take and leave it, but love is all I am.. Love is all I am.. I need a boundless, soft way to commend. Like you as a temper, and I as it's tender end.. And however long your fits last. I will live within your shadow cast.. And love is still your stranger; it does not respect how much you'll stand. You might be love's reminder, but love is all I am.. Love is all am.. I need a graceful, proud way to let go. To smile and accept the things that you don't know. The losses and the gains blurred. The weight of these as last words. And love is not excitement; it's not kissing, or holding hands. I'm not some assignment; no, love is all I am. Love is all I am.. Love is all I am."
million dollar bill,When it hits me what she's gone. I think I'll run for president. Get my face put on the million dollar bill. So when these rich men that she wants. Show her ways they can take care of her. I'll have found a way to be there with her still. When it hits me that she's gone. I think I'll be an astronaut. Make the moon my home and leave the earth behind. So when eh steps out into the night. She'll be facing me every time she shines. When it hits me that she's left me alone. When I finally move on with my life. Her goodbye written into stone. And her shadow grown into a night. When it hits me that she's gone. I think I'll be a movie star. Play the finest men the world has ever seen. So when these lovers that she's found. Show her ways they learned to talk to her. Behind each perfect word there'll be a little bit of me
moon in the water,"When the wind is with me. But somehow out of sight. Not knowing where it comes from. Or where it goes. That's the way your memory. Shapes the middle of my night. Since the last time I saw you. And the words you chose. When I said, ""This must be what love is. like I saw it in a dream"". You looked into my eyes and said, ""You. don't know what you mean. Cause love is for the fisherman who cast. his nets too far upstream. Fishing for the moon in the water. So I act now as if I've forgot. My efforts all in vain. I spent some time with a new girl. Who made the simple world seem fine. But like a rose placed in a flower pot. A true nature contained. Not knowing what she asks for. Or what she'll find. When she says, ""If I've had love in my. life then surely this is it"". I said, ""Anyone who talks like that doesn't. understand one bit. That love is for the fighter born to lose. but never quit. Swinging for the moon in the water"". So I left her with her dreams where I. thought that she belonged. Not with my secrets, which she heard but never knew. I hoped my loneliness found peace. I hoped my number had been drawn. When all I wanted from her was to. remind me of you. So I stay out in the streets. Hoping to find you anywhere. Now that I understand. The woman you need to be. I can feel you in the heat. I can taste you in the air. And I can't help but find your face in. everything I see. And once I can admit you're gone I'll. place it on a star. And wait for the day I'm what you need. and then reach out for heart. Cause even if love is more my mistress. than my lovers ever are. You'll always be the moon in the water"
my girl to me,"Go ahead and let your hands stay entwined,. I swear I could not possibly mind.. And when she lets down her guard,. Don't kiss her too hard.. She's sure to repay in kind.. Don't let your courtesy last too long,. My love blooms when I know it's gone.. So if I'm in the room,. It should be fair to assume:. You can both act how you want.. And I won't cross the line you drew. Cause I'm not here to compete. Oh and I don't know what she tells you,. But she's still my girl to me.. She's good with quick goodbyes. And whenever she rolls her eyes. That's her admission of guilt. On the temper she built,. And for me that's her most familiar side.. I'm always watching my bridges burn,. But if she didn't leave then she can't return.. And I don't know you too well,. But it's not too hard to tell. I miss her but I'm not concerned.. And I'm glad to see that someone stayed. I don't want to see her grieve. But it doesn't matter what you say,. She is still my girl to me.. Oh that's the way my sister might give a kiss. Oh, how I feel so passively missed.. And she says in your ear, as if I wasn't here. (???) don't know who he is. Oh, call me names if it comforts you. There are worst things I could be. But it doesn't matter if it isn't true-. She is still my girl to me"
my way back home,A ballerina in Phoenix. The pines up north. The sunrise from a highway. That was not there before. If I can place it all together. Make out the nature of the call. I start to feel the love and the silence. That was always at the root of it all. And in my constant quest for truth. I am condemned to facts alone. And though my dreams all lead me nowhere. I won’t forget my way back home. From the corner of a coffee shop. Or from the center of a stage. From the words used in a love note. Or from an empty page. While I struggle with these beauties. And my renditions end up dry. I’m like a bird that crashes into the window. That was drawn to the reflection of the sky. And the more I try to speak. The more I lose that earthly tone. And before heaven proves me hopeless. I won’t forget my way back home. Ooh Oooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh...... I admit that these answers that I seek. Are all to questions I’ve never known. But I pray to keep on looking for as long as I can roam. And when the world finally fulfills me. I will not forget my way back home
peace in the valley,"I think these walls have a message or have changed. Which it is I can't decide.. So I leave with the writer that remains. And let him tell me what his better days were like.. And I sit with the memory of kings. With only words to criticize. As if I finally found the antidote for pain. Without knowing what that's really like.. And our actor ends his love song. And all these lovers sit and stare.. If I don't find peace in the valley. It's cause there wasn't any there.. I will move somewhere the ocean's never seen.. Somewhere weeds just make their place. Where my best friend's exist only on screen. Where my love all fits and frays. But I want fire tumbling out into the night. I want you to know why you hold me close. Pull the quarter from my ear, or say you tried. I need magic or the holy ghost.. And as I drive on through these canyons. I'm still feeling like a crook. If I don't find peace in the valley. I've got no place else to look."
so well,"I am an old old sailor. With a future much shorter than his past. I live alone, I do not wander. A world that just slips further from my grasp. And from my home I watch the people. Struggle through the burden of each day. That’s where Marie sweet and gentle. Smiles to me when she passes on her way. And she does it so well. She pulls me out of times cruel spell. For long enough to finally tell. That nothing is wrong. I am a boy, I am a child. With those simple dreams still burning in my heart. I’ve known Marie for a while. She shows me where all my beginnings are. And once a week she takes me dancing. She shows me friends and places I never knew. And it always ends watching her leaving. With a man she knows don’t understand what loneliness will make you do. And she does it so well. She shows me where my dreams dwell. She shows me how to find myself. And that nothing is wrong. I am a lonely singer. With a song for every feeling I cannot name. And I find Marie in every measure. And somehow the clearer it becomes the longer she’s away. And she does it so well. I was still falling in love when she said farewell. For long enough to finally tell. That nothing is wrong...that nothing is wrong"
strangers getting stranger,"Did you hear the one about a joke without a punch-line. Or the song about a movie of a book. Like a stolen bouquet meant to be given away. To the girl that never gives you a look. Well that's how I've been spending all my meantime. Wondering if it's doing any harm. Resetting myself to when everything felt. Like a book I'm holding under my arm. But it's not that I want back all my innocence. Just the joy of losing it again. The favorites get their favors. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. The great one's all get greater. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. We got doctors that know everything about us. We can level cities by the end of the day. The world is turning back into dust or maybe it's just. We're becoming all the god's that we've praised. Or maybe the world is finally moving on without us. While we wait to see who's winning some debate. It's like we're running a race after spinning in place. We're pulling left when we've been moving straight. But me I think I'll keep on spinning. And smile as I hit the ground. The favorites get their favors. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. The great one's all get greater. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. Like a tree that doesn't look for it's root, it grows. Like a bird on the day that it's season is through, it knows. The favorites get their favors. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday. The great one's all get greater. And this stranger's getting stranger everyday"
take me out of the city,"Take me out of the city,. Where my shadow can roam. Let me breath in the morning. Let my way be my home. Take me out of the city. True love I will not find. Take me in new one's heart. Take me out of my mind.. I feel my reflection slide along the eyes that march me past. I found my direction high up close to sun. That I've kept to my back.. Take me out of the city. Where God's never been. Where my soul is my sorrow,. And it's bound by my skin.. Take me out of the city. May I never return. Let the song of the mountain. Be the one that I've earned.. I feel my reflection slide along the eyes that march me past.. I found my direction high up close to sun. That I've kept to my back.. Take me out of the city. Where my shadow can roam. Let me breath in the morning. Let my way be my home."
that western skyline,"Oh, Lou- I'd like to let you know that I do not feel welcome.. All the birds, the trees, the falling snow. No they were not made for me.. And all this is where her heart resides; we met in California. She saw cities, promise reaching through my eyes. And she turned her self away. Well how I curse that western skyline.. And yet I thanked it for my start.. Oh rue, though my dreams did not come true; no they only came apart.. So I followed her here to Birmingham, where the soil is so much richer. And though my aching pride might guide my hand, she did not ask for me to come.. So I wait for her all through the day, as if I wait for her surrender.. And every time I get her to look my way, she says I'm not where I belong.. But I watch her father preach on Sundays.. And all the hymnals of my heart.. But oh, rue, my dreams did not come true; no they only came apart.. Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh. Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh. Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh. Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh. All the snow fall this time of year, it's not what Birmingham is used to. I get the feeling that I brought it here, and now I'm taking it away.. But let's share one more drink together, before I go reload my cart. Oh, Lou, no my dreams did not come true- no they only came apart.. Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh. Take me home,. Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh. Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh. Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh"
the way you laugh,I suppose we are born from our silence. But you seem to take yours with you. Like a child that refuses to bloom. You forced me to face all of your beauty. Then turned your beauty away from yourself. This road that we've taken doesn't seem to stop here. But doesn't seem to go anywhere else. And your heart rests in your chest. Like a charm 'round your neck. That you couldn't find words to refuse. And this high horse you ride. It has broken its stride. As it leads us through worlds built for you. So walk with me a little bit further. So I can find the tenderness you keep inside. God made you with a taste for the madness in love. But you confuse your gift with your pride. And I can't help you with removed that bandage. I will leave you all to yourself while you heal. As I'm learning time is a language. And it's the best way to explain how I feel. And while the magician you meet. Sweeps you off your feet. Saying he'll teach you tricks all for free. I'll be in the way that you laugh. As he cuts you in half. And holds you up for the crowds all to see. So forgive me for feeling so strongly. But I feel like we can finally agree. That true lovers always end up lonely. Cause they know how good it could be. I've heard the men in your wake. Describe you as a snake. As you slip away when they start to wilt. But I firmly believe. You're a lot more like Eve. As she enjoys a bit of her guilt
things happen,"I could go on talking or I could stop. Wring out each memory 'til I get every drop. Sift through the details of the others involved. The true crime would be thinking it's just one person's fault. Like an honest signature on a fake id. Like the guilty conscience with the innocent plea. You can just ignore it, put it out of mind. But ain't it funny how the past won't ever let something lie?. Let's make a list of all the things. the world has put you through. Let's raise a glass to all the people you're not speaking to. I don't know what else you wanted me to say to you. Things happen, that's all they ever do. In a different time, on a different floor. I might mourn the loss of who I'm not anymore. So I'm driving out to oakland for a good look back. And a few revisions to my plan of attack. Let's make a list of all the things. the world has put you through. Let's raise a glass to all the people you're not speaking to. I don't know what else you wanted me to say to you. Things happen, that's all they ever do. I think I'll see lilly. See where she stands. I can't help how I feel, I don't think anyone can. Sometimes we're lovers, sometimes we're friends. The hope of magnetism between two dead ends. Let's make a list of all the things. the world has put you through. Let's raise a glass to all the people you're not speaking to. I don't know what else you wanted me to say to you. Things happen, that's all they ever do. Or why a mom's compelled to bronze its baby's shoes. I don't know what else that you want me to say to you. Things happen, that's all they ever do. That's all they ever do. That's all they ever do. That's all they ever do"
time spent in los angeles,These days my friends don’t seem to know me. Without my suitcase in my hand. Where I am standing still. I seem to disappear. But maybe that's how I found you. Maybe that's taugh me exactly what I want. Maybe meeting you so far away from home. Is what makes it all so clear. But you got that special kind of sadness. You got that tragic set of charms [Chorus]. That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles. Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms. When people ask me where I come from. To see what that says about man. I only end up giving bad directions. That never lead them there at all. It’s something written in the head lights. Is something swimming in my drink. And if I were the moon. It would be exactly where I fall. Cause you got that special kind of sadness. You got that tragic set of charms [Chorus]. That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles. Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms. I used to think someone would love me. For places I have been. And the dirt I have been gathering. Deep beneath my nails. But now I know what I’ve been missing. And I’m going home to make it mine. And I'll be battening the hatches and pulling in the sails.. But you got that special kind of sadness. You got that tragic set of charms [Chorus] x2. That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles. Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms
to be completely honest,To be completely honest. The picture isn't clear to me yet. You insisted that your own explanations. While I was patiently enjoying the debt. And when I think about it. I'm not even sure if I mind. You were the fading signal that would slip through the static. For a station that I never could find. So you don't need to say a word right now. All your reasons would just flicker in the darkness. Maybe that's why nobody knows how. To be completely honest. To be completely honest. It feels like you're still in the room. From the bracelets that you left on the nightstand. To the crows in the yard each afternoon. I just can't get off it (?). I haven't been sleeping at all. Some questions weave themselves into the fabric. And some are welcome tell me to call (?). But then I never know where I should start. And the record of the sit downs is all I have accomplished. I never really thought it'd be so hard. To be completely honest. To be completely honest. I think I know how it ends. The universe keeps expanding. While we discuss particulars of just being friends. And maybe that makes everything okay. Remembering the defect at the heart of every promise. Maybe that's the only way. To be completely honest (x4)
when my time comes,"There were moments of dreams I was offered to save. I live less like a workhorse, more like a slave. I thought that one quick moment that was noble or brace. Would be worth the most of my life.. So I pointed my fingers, and shout a few quotes I knew. As if something that's written should be taken as true. But every path I have taken and conclusion I drew. Would put truth back under the knife.. And now the only piece of advice that continues to help:. Is anyone that's making anything new only breaks something else.. When my time comes,. Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.. When my times comes,. Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.. So I took what I wanted and put it out of my reach. I wanted to pay for my successes with all my defeats,. And if heaven was all that was promised to me. Why don't I pray for death?. And now it seems like the unraveling has started too soon,. Now I'm sleeping in hallways and I'm drinking perfume. And I'm speaking to mirrors and I'm howling at moons. While the worst and the worst that it gets.. Oh you can judge all the world on the sparkle that you think it lacks.. Yes you can stare into the abyss, but it's staring right back.. When my time comes,. Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.. When my time comes,. Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.. Oh you can judge all the world on the sparkle that you think it lacks.. Yes you can stare into the abyss, but it's staring right back.. When my time comes,. Ohhhhh, oh oh oh.. When my time comes,. Ohhhhh, oh oh oh."
when you call my name,"If all my lovers sing the big words. And all my brothers keep them small. Then I get lost in the difference, between their whisper and the echo of their call. So I am headed for the ocean,. to let the sea-smoke guide me in.. I'll give up my belongings and questions,. they only ever taught me to begin.. So I will not turn around,. as I step up to the train,. But I'll hear it when you call my name.. And I will not be the sound,. of your roof under the rain,. But I'll hear it when you call my name.. So I am taking off my wrist watch,. to let the time move how I please.. To let my day be guided by the sunlight,. Through mornings knell and twilights soft release. So if you want to get to know me,. follow my smile into it's curves. All these lines are born in sorrows and in pleasures,. and every man ends up with the face that he deserves.. So I will not give you bread,. As you reach out from your cage,. But I'll hear it when you call my name.. And I will not give applause,. as you step off of the stage,. But I'll hear it when you call my name.. There's a river running through the city. Gently reminding me what's what.. Of course, you are invited to come with me. But I don't think that's really what you want.. I think you want a world that will hold you,. Through security, and gravity, and love. And I can't think of anyone who'd blame you,. And I can't think of how that'd be enough.. So I won't come back around,. When you've cursed the ground you've tamed,. But I'll hear it when you call my name. And when you realize once I'm gone. That I never really came,. Oh, I'll hear it when you call my name.. And when the burden of the sun,. Reveals to you it's pain,. Oh, I'll hear it when you call my name.. And when you realize that you're wrong,. But you still give me all the blame,. I'll hear it when you call my name."
