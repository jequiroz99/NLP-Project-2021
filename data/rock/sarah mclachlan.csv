angel,Spend all your time waiting. For that second chance. For a break that would make it okay. There's always some reason. To feel not good enough. And it's hard at the end of the day. I need some distraction. Oh beautiful release. Memories seep from my veins. Let me be empty. Oh and weightless and maybe. I'll find some peace tonight. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you feel. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here. So tired of the straight line. And everywhere you turn. There's vultures and thieves at your back. And the storm keeps on twisting. You keep on building the lies. That you make up for all that you lack. It don't make no difference. Escaping one last time. It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh. This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you feel. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here

i will remember you,"I will remember you. Will you remember me?. Don't let you life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. I'm so tired but I can't sleep. Standing on the edge of something much too deep. It's funny how we feel so much but cannot say a word. We are screaming inside but we can't be heard. I will remember you. Will you remember me?. Don't let your life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. I'm so afraid to love you but more afraid to lose. Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose. Once there was a darkness deep and endless night. You gave me everything you had,oh you gave me light. And I will remember you. Will you remember me?. Don't let you life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. And I will remember you. Will you remember me?. Don't let life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. Weep not for the memories"
fallen,"Heaven bent to take my hand. And lead me through the fire. Be the long awaited answer. To a long and painful fight. Truth be told I've tried my best. But somewhere along the way. I got caught up in all there was to offer. And the cost was so much more than I could bear. Though I've tried, I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so.... We all begin with good intent. Love was raw and young. We believed that we could change ourselves. THe past could be undone. But we carry on our backs the burden. Time always reveals. The lonely light of morning. The wound that would not heal. It's the bitter taste of losing everything. That I have held so dear.. I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so.... Heaven bent to take my hand. Nowhere left to turn. I'm lost to those I thought were friends. To everyone I know. Oh they turned their heads embarassed. Pretend that they don't see. But it's one missed step. You'll slip before you know it. And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed. Though I've tried, I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so..."
don't let go,"Don't Let Go (With Bryan Adams). I can't believe this moment's come. It's so incredible that we're alone. There's so much to be said and done. It's impossible not to be overcome. Will you forgive me if I feel this way. Cuz we've just met - tell me that's OK. So take this feeling'n make it grow. Never let it - never let it go. (Dont let go of the things you believe in). You give me something that I can believe in. (Dont' let go of this moment in time). Go of this moment in time. (Don't let go of things that you're feeling). I can't explain the things that I'm feeling. (Dont' let go). No, I won't let go. Now would you mind if I bared my soul. If I came right out and said your'e beautiful. Cuz there's something here I can't explain. I feel I'm diving into driving rain. You get my senses running wild. I can't resist your sweet, sweet smile. So take this feeling'n make it grow. Never let it - never let it go. Chorus:. I've been waiting all my life. To make this moment feel so right. The feel of you just fills the night."
amazing grace,"Amazing Grace! how sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now am found. Was blind but now I see. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear. And grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believed. Through many dangers, toils, and snares. I have already come. 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far. And grace will lead me home. The Lord has promised good to me. His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be. As long as life endures. And when this flesh. and heart shall fail. and mortal life shall cease. I shall possess. within the vale. a life of joy and peace. When we've been there ten thousand years. Bright, shining as the sun. We've no less days to sing God's praise. Than when we first begun"

I can't believe in you.. Did you make disease, and the diamond blue?. Did you make mankind after we made you?. And the devil too?!. Dear God,. Don't know if you noticed, but.... Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book,. Us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look,. And all the people that you made in your image,. Still believing that junk is true. Well I know it ain't, and so do you. Dear God,. I can't believe in.... I don't believe in.... I won't believe in heaven and hell.. No saints, no sinners, no devil as well.. No pearly gates, no thorny crown.. You're always letting us humans down.. The wars you bring, the babes you drown.. Those lost at sea and never found,. And it's the same the whole world 'round.. The hurt I see helps to compound. That Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Is just somebody's unholy hoax. And if you're up there you'd perceive. That my heart's here upon my sleeve..

u want me 2,"You walk on by. Clueless and so high. Following your aimless path away from us. You're so far away. And what can I say. Cause I can't be the one you wanted me to be. So tell me how do you feel. It's so confusing. If you let it all go, it'll fall apart. Do you want me to stay and say I still want you. You want me too, don't you?. So what are we saying. Our eden's a failure. A made-up story to fit the picture-perfect world. The one with ""I do""s. and I love you. And we are made for each other. Is forever over now?. And tell me how do you feel. It's so confusing. If you let it all go, it'll fall apart. Do you want me to stay and say I still want you. You want me too, don't you?. I hope there's forgiveness. In the distance between us. Can we make what lies ahead of us a better place to be?. So tell me, how do you feel. It's so confusing. If you let it all go, it'll fall ---. Do you want me to stay and say I still want you. You want me too, don't you?. . (Juliane)"
full of grace,"The winter here's cold, and bitter. it's chilled us to the bone. I haven't seen the sun for weeks. too long too far from home. I feel just like I'm sinking. and I claw for solid ground. I'm pulled down by the undertow. I never thought I could feel so low. oh darkness I feel like letting go. If all of the strength and all of the courage. come and lift me from this place. I know I could love you much better than this. full of grace. full of grace. my love. So it's better this way, I say. having seen this place before. where everything we say and do. hurts us all even more. its just that we stayed, too long. in the same old sickly skin. I'm pulled down by the undertow. I never thought I could feel so low. oh darkness I feel like letting go. If all of the strength. and all of the courage. come and lift me from this place. I know I could love you much better than this. full of grace. full of grace. my love."
bring on the wonder,"I can't see the stars anymore living here. Let's go to the hills where the outlines are clear. Bring on the wonder. Bring on the song. I pushed you down deep in my soul for too long. I fell through the cracks at the end of our street. Let's go to the beach, get the sand through our feet. Bring on the wonder. Bring on the song. I pushed you down deep in my soul for too long. Bring on the wonder. We got it all wrong. We pushed you down deep in our souls for too long. I don't have the time for a drink from the cup. Let's rest for a while 'til our souls catch us up. Bring on the wonder. Bring on the song I pushed you down deep in my soul for too long. Bring on the wonder. We got it all wrong. We pushed you down deep in our souls, so hang on. Bring on the wonder. Bring on the song. I pushed you down deep in my soul for too long"
back door man,"You open your eyes, look around. You feel the earth, it wanders -. Out, from under your feet - the ground. Is not firm but soft and weak - like skin. under the touch, cannot stop to falter. Now, the damage is done, the certainties gone. The spirit's altered. And now the angry morning. Gives the early signs of warning. You must face alone, the plans you make. Decisions they will try to break. Our hands are tied on the table. Maybe you can try at the back door man. While the helpless line up on the doorsteps. 'Cause it's all they can do to try to get through. All of your life you've lived in a world as pure. As eden's sixth day - now, all you've been allowed. Is taken away - they will not let you be so proud. And you have the fear growing inside. Protest follows far and wide - they'll see how long. It will take 'till you fall - from so much denied. Your soul - it aches relentless for the fear. That they will never guess - so unfair that. They can make you feel so small. And the fear you know is real. Our hands are tied on the table. Maybe you can try at the back door man. While the helpless line up on the doorsteps. 'Cause it's all they can do to try to get through. Oh, 'cause it's all they can do to try to get through"
awakenings,"We first met, the well was dry. A long dark winter passed us by. With shooting stars and hopeful hearts, our worlds collide. And so we rushed to fill each other in. Quick to feed our hungry hopes. A feast of our affections, we were born anew. With open eyes we tried to make it work. And for a while the magic took. But cracks began to show as soon as things got hard. Like paper walls our feelings tore. We threw our backs against the door. Unwilling to bear witness to the other side. Oh, the games we play to hide, the tangled dread inside. The fear that we are going nowhere fast. I point the finger out, the anger gets so loud. It drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow...what then?. I took a good hard look at how I loved. Years I squandered falling fast. For any boy who'd have me was so insecure. I'd lie awake alone at night. Full of loathing, compromised. And wondering how the hell did I end up like this. Oh, the tears of rage I cried, when nowhere could I find. An answer that made any kind of sense to me. I point the finger out, the anger gets so loud. It drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow.... Oh I wanna learn, I wanna know. Will our history crush us or can we let it go?. I'm not the girl I was but what have I become?. I'm not so willing anymore to bend. Still pleasing and conceding, but I'm not gonna lose myself again"
ben's song,"On the hills of fire, the darkest hour. I was dreaming of my true love's pyre. Who will bring a light to stoke the fire. Fear not, for you're still breathing. On a winter's day. I saw the life-blood drained away. A cold wind blows on a windless day. Hear the cry for new life, the mourning's flame. You were the brightest light that burned to soon in vain. Who will bring you back from where there's no return. Fear not, for you're just dreaming. On a winter's day. I saw the life-blood drained away. A cold wind blows on a windless day."
little b,"Time for bed little bee, little bee. I will always love you more than you love me. I will treasure these years of our borrowed time. As much as I want it, I know you're not mine. Good night moon. Giving trees. Love you forever. Pirate seas. Remember these moments. As you grow. A few more cuddles. Before I let you go. Heart of the jungle and dragon's lair. Just remember someday how much your daddy cared. Into your dreams I will watch you drift. Your memories of this will be my greatest gift. Good night moon. Giving trees. Love you forever. Pirate seas. Remember these moments. As you grow. A few more cuddles. Before I let you go"
beautiful girl,"One thing that I know. It will get better. Each and every drought. Ends in the river. If I were a diviner, you'd be awash in rain to cool your fire. Oh to cool your fire. There could be winds of change in my auburn hair. But I'll tie it back for now. And when the bitter breeze carries a trace of fear. We'll persevere some how. We're gonna push on through, pretty girl. Just like we always do, beautiful girl. I know the world can be cruel, pretty girl. You're gonna make it 'cause you've got love on your side. The truth of letting go. Lies in the answer.

There could be winds of change in my auburn hair. But I'll tie it back for now. And when the bitter breeze carries a trace of fear. We'll persevere somehow. We're gonna push on through, pretty girl. Just like we always do, beautiful girl. I know the world can be cruel, pretty girl. You're gonna make it 'cause you got love on your side. Pretty girl. One thing that I know. Is it will get better?"
answer,"I will be the answer. At the end of the line. I will be there for you. While you take the time. In the burning of uncertainty. I will be your solid ground. I will hold the balance.

And when the stars have all gone out. You'll still be burning so bright. Cast me gently. Into morning. For the night has been unkind. Take me to a. A place so holy. That I can wash this from my mind. The memory of choosing not to fight. If it takes my whole life. I won't break, I won't bend. It will all be worth it. Worth it in the end. 'Cause I can only tell you what I know. That I need you in my life. And when the stars have all burned out. You'll still be burning so bright. Cast me gently. Into morning"

It drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow...what then?. I took a good hard look at how I loved. Years I squandered falling fast. For any boy who'd have me was so insecure. I'd lie awake alone at night. Full of loathing, compromised. And wondering how the hell did I end up like this. Oh, the tears of rage I cried, when nowhere could I find. An answer that made any kind of sense to me. I point the finger out, the anger gets so loud. It drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow.... Oh I wanna learn, I wanna know. Will our history crush us or can we let it go?. I'm not the girl I was but what have I become?. I'm not so willing anymore to bend. Still pleasing and conceding, but I'm not gonna lose myself again"
away in a manger,"Away in a manger. No crib for His bed. The little Lord Jesus. Laid down His sweet head. The stars in the bright sky. Looked down where He lay. The little Lord Jesus. Asleep on the hay. The cattle are lowing. The Baby awakes. A little Lord Jesus. No crying He makes. I love Thee, Lord Jesus. Look down from the sky. And stay by my side. 'Til morning is nigh. Be near me, Lord Jesus. I ask Thee to stay. Close by me forever. And love me I pray. Bless all the dear children. In Thy tender care. And take us to heaven. To live with Thee there"
back door man,"You open your eyes, look around. You feel the earth, it wanders -. Out, from under your feet - the ground. Is not firm but soft and weak - like skin. under the touch, cannot stop to falter. Now, the damage is done, the certainties gone. The spirit's altered. And now the angry morning. Gives the early signs of warning. You must face alone, the plans you make. Decisions they will try to break. Our hands are tied on the table. Maybe you can try at the back door man. While the helpless line up on the doorsteps. 'Cause it's all they can do to try to get through. All of your life you've lived in a world as pure. As eden's sixth day - now, all you've been allowed. Is taken away - they will not let you be so proud. And you have the fear growing inside. Protest follows far and wide - they'll see how long. It will take 'till you fall - from so much denied. Your soul - it aches relentless for the fear. That they will never guess - so unfair that. They can make you feel so small. And the fear you know is real. Our hands are tied on the table. Maybe you can try at the back door man. While the helpless line up on the doorsteps. 'Cause it's all they can do to try to get through. Oh, 'cause it's all they can do to try to get through"
beautiful girl,"One thing that I know. It will get better. Each and every drought. Ends in the river. If I were a diviner, you'd be awash in rain to cool your fire. Oh to cool your fire. There could be winds of change in my auburn hair. But I'll tie it back for now. And when the bitter breeze carries a trace of fear. We'll persevere some how. We're gonna push on through, pretty girl. Just like we always do, beautiful girl. I know the world can be cruel, pretty girl. You're gonna make it 'cause you've got love on your side. The truth of letting go. Lies in the answer. That when the storm subsides. I'll still be there to hold you. There's beauty in your violence, and the dissonant melody. I hear you sing. Oh I love to hear you sing. There could be winds of change in my auburn hair. But I'll tie it back for now. And when the bitter breeze carries a trace of fear. We'll persevere somehow. We're gonna push on through, pretty girl. Just like we always do, beautiful girl. I know the world can be cruel, pretty girl. You're gonna make it 'cause you got love on your side. Pretty girl. One thing that I know. Is it will get better?"
ben's song,"On the hills of fire, the darkest hour. I was dreaming of my true love's pyre. Who will bring a light to stoke the fire. Fear not, for you're still breathing. On a winter's day. I saw the life-blood drained away. A cold wind blows on a windless day. Hear the cry for new life, the mourning's flame. You were the brightest light that burned to soon in vain. Who will bring you back from where there's no return. Fear not, for you're just dreaming. On a winter's day. I saw the life-blood drained away. A cold wind blows on a windless day."
black,As the walls are closing in. And the colors fade to black. And my eyes are falling fast and deep into me. And I follow the tracks that lead me down. And I never follow what's right. And they wonder sometimes when they see all the. Sadness and pain that truth brings to light. 'Cause I can't see no reason. What is blind cannot see. 'Cause I want what is pleasing. All I take should be free. What I rob from the innocent ones. What I'd steal from the womb. If I cried me a river of all my confessions. Would I drown in my shallow regret. As the walls are closing in. And the colors fade to black. And my eyes are falling fast and deep into the sea. And in darkness all that I can see. The frightened and the weak. Are forced to cling to mistakes they know nothing of. At mercy are the meak. 'Cause I can't see no reason. What is blind cannot see. 'Cause I want what is pleasing. All I take should be free. What I rob from the innocent ones. What I'd steal from the womb. If I cried me a river of all my confessions. Would I drown in my shallow regret. If I cried me a river of all my confessions. Would I drown in my shallow regret. If I cried me a river of all my confessions. Would I drown in my shallow regret. If I cried me a river of all my confessions. Would I drown in my shallow regret
black & white,Unravel me. a distant cord. on the outside is forgotten. a constant need. To get along. and the animal awakens. and all I feel is black and white. The road is long. the memory slides. to the whole of my undoing. put aside. I put away. I push it back to get through each day. and all I feel is black and white. and I'm wound up small and tight. and I don't know who I am.

bring on the wonder,"I can't see the stars anymore living here. Let's go to the hills where the outlines are clear. Bring on the wonder. Bring on the song. I pushed you down deep in my soul for too long. I fell through the cracks at the end of our street. Let's go to the beach, get the sand through our feet. Bring on the wonder. Bring on the song. I pushed you down deep in my soul for too long. Bring on the wonder. We got it all wrong. We pushed you down deep in our souls for too long. I don't have the time for a drink from the cup. Let's rest for a while 'til our souls catch us up. Bring on the wonder. Bring on the song I pushed you down deep in my soul for too long. Bring on the wonder. We got it all wrong. We pushed you down deep in our souls, so hang on. Bring on the wonder. Bring on the song. I pushed you down deep in my soul for too long"
brink of destruction,"It would be if it could be so wonderful if we succeed. Your warmth and your words found. A place in my world and breathed new life in. We come from the brink of destruction. We gathered ourselves from the floor. We tried and we suffered and finally recovered. And found a new way to live. We're two side by side with impossible dreams. Taking a chance to let love in. Storms come, I learned to be strong. I don't lean on anyone else. But now I am so content here in your arms. I don't want to be anywhere else. With you I'm home, with you I'm home. I hold fast to my destination I know that the road will be long. We light up the sky let the beauty define us and give. Give it all we got. We're two side by side with impossible dreams. Taking a chance to let love in. Storms come, I learned to be strong. I don't lean on anyone else. But now I'm so content here in your arms. I don't want to be anywhere else. With you I'm home, with you I'm home"
broken heart,Are we just drops of rain. Falling for a little while. Playing hard we lose and gain. Trying to hold on to what matters. Till the end. I keep walking forward. Like I know where I? m heading. How I wish you were here to see me. Trying to live up to my name. Till the end. I should be thinking with my head. Not with my broken heart. Look to the future for all it can give. And not to us being apart. We trip and fall and stand again. And go on with our heads held high. We laugh and love as best we can. Trying to hold on to the wonder. How long? How long?. I should be thinking with my head. And not with my broken heart. Look to the future for all it's got. And not to us being apart. Sometimes I feel I can't go on. I let it get me down so hard to heal oh and I fall. Fall to my knees it hurts to survive the love that's gone. But I should be thinking with my head. And not with my broken heart. Look to the future for all it's got and not to us being apart
building a mystery,"You come out at night. That's when the energy comes. And the dark side's light. And the vampires roam. You strut your rasta wear. And your suicide poem. And a cross from a faith that died. Before Jesus came. You're building a mystery. You live in a church. Where you sleep with voodoo dolls. And you won't give up the search. For the ghosts in the halls. You wear sandals in the snow. And a smile that won't wash away. Can you look out the window. Without your shadow getting in the way?. You're so beautiful. With an edge and charm. but so careful. When I'm in your arms. Cause you're working. Building a mystery. Holding on and holding it in. Yeah you're working. Building a mystery. And choosing so carefully. You woke up screaming aloud. A prayer from your secret god. You feed off our fears. And hold back your tears, oh. Give us a tantrum. And a know it all grin. Just when we need one. When the evening's thin. You're a beautiful. A beautiful fucked up man. You're setting up your. Razor wire shrine. Cause you're working. Building a mystery. Holding on and holding it in. Yeah you're working. Building a mystery. And choosing so carefully. Ooh you're working. Building a mystery. Holding on and holding it in. Yeah you're working. Building a mystery. And choosing so carefully. Yeah you're working. Building a mystery. Holding on and holding it in. Yeah you're working. Building a mystery. And choosing so carefully. You're building a mystery."
captive,"streets are dark and empty now. time for another day. I walk alone collecting my thoughts. that have gone astray. all of the memories, all of the dreams. still remains entwined. all that we've heard, and all that we've known. forgotten by your mind. I only wanted someone to believe in. oh but your words they're seldom found. cause when it comes to the problems. that were meant to be shared. you were not around. oh but you plead with me now. you always stay. you'll give it in one breath then. you'll take it all away. what is this love. that holds me captive in your eyes. well I wish I had the strength. to leave it all behind. what's done is done. and you do not give a damn. just another heartfelt blow. by your careless hand.

changes,"I can’t believe that you’re walking away from us. Could not conceive we’d ever be done. But I feel you drifting you don’t have to hid from me. I just keep hoping you let me in. Maybe I can’t help but talking may, I am here for you. Time passes us by and the way we love changes. And we’re learning to waltz through the waves like everyone. Let it keep us from falling. Would you dance with me now?. The candle burned out and we stumbled around in the dark. And I can feel you slipping away. The band keeps on playing the world keeps revolving. Around all the static, the noise in between. And we need to hear that song again, let the love shine through. Time passes us by and the way we love changes. And we’re learning to waltz through the waves like everyone. Let it keep us from falling Would you dance with me, dance with me now?. New walls new ladders, none of this matters. We can’t walk on water, we can only do better. If its not forever, if it’s time to go. I will always remember. I want you to know. When you held me in your arms and said, let the love shine through. Time passes us by and the way we love changes. And we’re learning to waltz through the waves like every one. Let it keep us from falling. Would you dance with me, dance with me now?. Would you dance with me, dance with me now?"

circle,There are two of us talking in circles. and one of us who wants to leave. in a world created for only us. an empty cage that has no key. don't you know we're working with flesh and blood. carving out of jealousy. Crawling into each other it's smothering. every little part of me. What kind of love is this that keeps me hanging on. despite everything it's doing to me. what is this love that keeps me coming back for more. when it will only end in misery. I know too many people unhappy. in a life from which they'd love to flee. watching others get everything offered. they're wanton for discovery. Oh my brother my sister my mother. you're losing your identity. can't you see that it's you in the window. shining with intensity. What kind of love is this that keeps me hanging on. despite everything it's doing to me. what is this love that keeps me coming back for more. when it will only end in misery...
dark angel,I met this girl. She was walking through one of my dreams. She kissed my eyes. And everything that she said. Made so much sense to me. That I still feel like half asleep. My dark angel. She gave me diamonds for eyes. She walked by. Now I'm hypnotised. By this dream. That just won't stop. And I feel. Like I've always been lost in this dream. The rumours of heaven. Only speed the truth on Earth. My dark angel. Shine your light on my curse. You are the other that I have to find. Until I do. I guess I'll see you 'round my mind. So Colorado. Is a place I have to go. I heard a rumour. She loves the mountains and the snow. My dark angel. She gave me diamonds for eyes. My dark angel. I offer you my heart. My dark angel. I think I loved you from the start. Cause there's this face I know. That I've never seen. Sometimes I feel like I'm livin' in. Someone else's dream. Still I'd like to thank you. For stoppin' to talk. And I wonder. Just into who's dream did who walk. Oh my dark angel. Shine your light on me. Shine your light. Shine your light. On me
dear god,"Dear God,. Hope you got the letter and. I pray you can make it better down here.. I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer. But all the people that you made in your image,. See them starving on their feet. 'Cause they don't get enough to eat. From God. I can't believe in you.. Dear God,. Sorry to disturb you, but. I feel that I should be heard loud and clear.. We all need a big reduction in the amount of tears. And all the people that you made in your image,. See them fighting in the street. 'Cause they can't make opinions meet. About God,. I can't believe in you.. Did you make disease, and the diamond blue?. Did you make mankind after we made you?. And the devil too?!. Dear God,. Don't know if you noticed, but.... Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book,. Us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look,. And all the people that you made in your image,. Still believing that junk is true. Well I know it ain't, and so do you. Dear God,. I can't believe in.... I don't believe in.... I won't believe in heaven and hell.. No saints, no sinners, no devil as well.. No pearly gates, no thorny crown.. You're always letting us humans down.. The wars you bring, the babes you drown.. Those lost at sea and never found,. And it's the same the whole world 'round.. The hurt I see helps to compound. That Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Is just somebody's unholy hoax. And if you're up there you'd perceive. That my heart's here upon my sleeve.. If there's one thing I don't believe in...... It's you....."
dirty little secret,"If I had the chance love. I would not hesitate. To tell you all things I´ve never said before. Don't tell me it's too late. [Chorus:]. Cause I've relied on my illusion. To keep me warm at night. And I've denied in my capacity to love. But I am willing to give up this fight. Been up all night drinking. To drown my sorrow down. But nothing seems to help me since you've gone away. I'm so tired of this town. Where every tongue is wagging. When every back is turned. They're telling secrets that should never be revealed. There's nothing to be gained from this. But disaster. Here's a good one. Did you hear about my friend. He's embarrassed to be seen now. Cause we all know his sins. If I had the chance love. I would not hesitate. To tell you all the things I´ve never said before. Don't tell me it's too late. [Chorus:]. Cause I've relied on my illusions. To keep me warm at night. And I've denied in my capacity to love. But I am willing to give up this fight. Oh, I am willing to give up this fight"

And I have the sense to recognize that. I don't know how to let you go. every moment marked. with apparitions of your soul.

That I don't know how. to let you go. I don't know how. to let you go. A glowing ember. burning hot. burning slow. deep within I'm shaken by the violence. of existing for only you. I know I can't be with you. I do what I have to do. I know I can't be with you. I do what I have to do. and I have sense to recognize but. I don't know how to let you go. I don't know how to let you go. I don't know how to let you go.
don't give up on us,"Love has taken me for a fool. Gotten out in time to save himself. Should have known better. But I'll let things slide. I took you for granted. That you would always be the one for me. Maybe I stopped trying. Oh baby, don't give up on us. I know your heart is full of doubt. You don't need to be without these lovin' arms. That will hold you through your darkest hour. I'll be using all my power so I can reach you. Don't give up on us. I've been living alone here or have I turned to dust?. It hurts, it hurts to wait for just a little love. You must give me a sign now. Can't you see me standing here alive and well. With all the hope you'd be the one for me. Maybe I'll keep trying.

Will you forgive me if I feel this way. Cuz we've just met - tell me that's OK. So take this feeling'n make it grow. Never let it - never let it go. (Dont let go of the things you believe in). You give me something that I can believe in. (Dont' let go of this moment in time). Go of this moment in time. (Don't let go of things that you're feeling). I can't explain the things that I'm feeling. (Dont' let go). No, I won't let go. Now would you mind if I bared my soul. If I came right out and said your'e beautiful. Cuz there's something here I can't explain. I feel I'm diving into driving rain. You get my senses running wild. I can't resist your sweet, sweet smile. So take this feeling'n make it grow. Never let it - never let it go. Chorus:. I've been waiting all my life. To make this moment feel so right. The feel of you just fills the night."
drawn to the rhythm,When we wore a heart of stone we wandered to the sea. Hoping to find some comfort there yearning to feel free. And we were mesmerized by the lull of the night and the smells that filled the air. And we layed us down on sandy ground it was cold but we didn't care. (CHORUS:). And we were drawn to the rhythm. Drawn to the rhythm of the sea. And we were drawn to the rhythm. Drawn to the rhythm of the sea. We fell asleep and began to dream when something broke the night. Memories stirred inside of us the struggle and the fight. And we could feel the heat of a thousand voices telling us which way to go. And we cried out is there no escape from the words that plague us so. (CHORUS). In the still and silent dawn another day is born. Washed up by the tireless waves the body bent and torn. When you wake in the face of the blinding sun and you search only to find. That heaven is a stranger place than what you've left behind. (CHORUS)

drifting,"You've been gone so long all that you know. has been shuffled aside as you bask in the glow. of the beautiful strangers who whisper your name. do they fill up the emptiness?. [Chorus]. Larger than life is your fiction. In a universe made up of one. You have been drifting for so long. I know you don't want to come down. Somewhere below you, there's people who love you. And they're ready for you to come home. Please come home. You walk in a room and the world stops to stare. Mesmerize all who are caught in the glare. Of the spotlight that follows wherever you go. Does it light up the emptiness?. [Chorus]. Larger than life is your fiction. In a universe made up of one. You have been drifting for so long. I know you don't want to come down. Somewhere below you, there's people who love you. And they're ready for you to come home."

fallen,"Heaven bent to take my hand. And lead me through the fire. Be the long awaited answer. To a long and painful fight. Truth be told I've tried my best. But somewhere along the way. I got caught up in all there was to offer. And the cost was so much more than I could bear. Though I've tried, I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so.... We all begin with good intent. Love was raw and young. We believed that we could change ourselves. THe past could be undone. But we carry on our backs the burden. Time always reveals. The lonely light of morning. The wound that would not heal. It's the bitter taste of losing everything. That I have held so dear.. I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so.... Heaven bent to take my hand. Nowhere left to turn. I'm lost to those I thought were friends. To everyone I know. Oh they turned their heads embarassed. Pretend that they don't see. But it's one missed step. You'll slip before you know it. And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed. Though I've tried, I've fallen.... I have sunk so low. I have messed up. Better I should know. So don't come round here. And tell me I told you so..."
fear,Morning smiles. like the face of a newborn child. innocent unknowing. Winter's end. promises of a long lost friend. speaks to me of comfort. but I fear. I have nothing to give. I have so much to lose. here in this lonely place. tangled up in our embrace. there's nothing I'd like. better than to fall. but I fear I have nothing to give. Wind in time. rapes the flower trembling on the vine. nothing yields to shelter it. from above. they say temptation will destroy our love. the never ending hunger. but I fear. I have nothing to give. I have so much to lose. here in this lonely place. tangled up in our embrace. there's nothing I'd like. better than to fall. but I fear. I have nothing to give. I have so much to lose.

flesh and blood,"Desire is no cautious creature. Insatiable like raging fire. A heat is rising all around. My senses so alive. It searches out the darkest places. No fear of walls or ways concealed. Set alight my secret longings. All revealed when I'm near you. Logic escapes me and I can't breathe. 'Cause you burn to my bones. Like you're all I've ever known. Let thunder crash, let rivers flood. If all we are is flesh and blood. The fury of the storm confounds me. Violence and beauty all collide. In all my animal emotions I can't fight this tide. 'Cause you are the wave that pulls me under. Ravage me from head to heart. And all my careful calculations. Fall apart when I'm near you. Logic escapes me, and I can't breathe. 'Cause you burn to my bones. Like you're all I've ever known. Let thunder crash, let rivers flood. If all we are is flesh and blood. Let thunder crash, let rivers flood. If all we are is flesh and blood. . 'Cause you burn to my bones. Like you're all I've ever known. Let thunder crash let rivers flood. If all we are is flesh and blood. Let thunder crash, let rivers flood. If all we are is flesh and blood. Let thunder crash, let rivers flood. If all we are is flesh and blood. Come together, fall apart. We build our towers with paper walls. As if we have any control lets burn it all"
forgiveness,"Loving, lying enemy. I have seen your face before. Never thought again I'd see. Didn't want to anymore. I remember your loving eyes. And the moonlit kiss. The evening lullabies. I would truly miss. Through the years we'd had it all. The midnight whispers, the midday calls. This house of cards it had to fall. (chorus). And you ask for forgiveness. You're asking too much. I have sheltered my heart in a place you can't touch. I don't believe when you tell me your love is real. Cause you don't know much about heaven boy. if you have to hurt to feel. Everytime I see you. I can't help but look away. All along I had believed. Eveything you'd say. When I look now I know. I've seen your face before. I don't want your deceiving smile. Standing at my door. I don't care what people say. I'm ready now to face this day. Cause I have lost you along the way. (chorus). Cause you don't know much about heaven boy. if you have to hurt. (chorus)"
full of grace,"The winter here's cold, and bitter. it's chilled us to the bone. I haven't seen the sun for weeks. too long too far from home. I feel just like I'm sinking. and I claw for solid ground. I'm pulled down by the undertow. I never thought I could feel so low. oh darkness I feel like letting go. If all of the strength and all of the courage. come and lift me from this place. I know I could love you much better than this. full of grace. full of grace. my love. So it's better this way, I say. having seen this place before. where everything we say and do. hurts us all even more. its just that we stayed, too long. in the same old sickly skin. I'm pulled down by the undertow. I never thought I could feel so low. oh darkness I feel like letting go. If all of the strength. and all of the courage. come and lift me from this place. I know I could love you much better than this. full of grace. full of grace. my love."
fumbling towards ecstasy,"All the fear has left me now. I'm not frightened anymore. It's my heart that pounds beneath my flesh. it's my mouth that pushes out this breath. and if I shed a tear I won't cage it. I won't fear love. and if I feel a rage I won't deny it. I won't fear love. Companion to our demons. they will dance, and we will play. With chairs, candles, and cloth. making darkness in the day. It will be easy to look in or out. upstream or down without a thought. and if I shed a tear I won't cage it. I won't fear love. and if I feel a rage I won't deny it. I won't fear love. Peace in the struggle. to find peace. comfort on the way. to comfort. and if I shed a tear I won't cage it. I won't fear love. and if I feel a rage I won't deny it. I won't fear love. I won't fear love. I won't fear love...."

heartbreak,"Before the night comes, before the city sleeps. I walk a lonely mile I see you watching,. I know you’re waiting. For me to make a sign. I know you’d like me to go and crumble.

I know you think that I would make good company…at last. You always come ’round after your good friend love. Has gone and run aground. A heart in shambles oh it’s just what you need. Your purpose found. And heartbreak no you can’t catch me. Hot on my heals but I move too fast. I know you think that I would make good company…yours at last. I’m free to wander so get up off of your knees. And find some other fool. Someone who’ll hold you when you’ve got no one to tease. It won’t be me"

home,"A child walks to the river. And looks as far as she can see. And draws each breath as if it were the last. And wipes away the tears across her sleave. She can see where the river crawls into the sea. Like a baby into mother's care. Somehow the longing is so far away. The innocence so wasted and aware. Look at the child with the dream in her eyes. Holding it deep inside her. Home... Home.... So much anger, so deeply ingrained. Seamed a burden that was hers alone. She didn't think that there was anything wrong. With wanting a life that she could call her own. How could I explain?. You would not want to hear. You wouldn't listen if I talked anyway. For you were too weighed down by your own fears. Look at the child with the dream in her eyes. Holding it deep inside.... Home... Home... Home... Home..."
huron carol,"Twas in the moon of winter-time. When all the birds had fled. That mighty Gitchi Manitou. Sent angel choirs instead. Before their light the stars grew dim. And wandering hunters heard the hymn. ""Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born. In excelsis gloria. "". Within a lodge of broken bark. The tender Babe was found. A ragged robe of rabbit skin. Enwrapp'd His beauty round. But as the hunter braves drew nigh. The angel song rang loud and high. ""Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born. In excelsis gloria. "". The earliest moon of wintertime. Is not so round and fair. As was the ring of glory. On the helpless infant there. The chiefs from far before him knelt. With gifts of fox and beaver pelt. Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born. In excelsis gloria. O children of the forest free. O sons of Manitou. The Holy Child of earth and heaven. Is born today for you. Come kneel before the radiant Boy. Who brings you beauty, peace and joy. ""Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born. In excelsis gloria. """

i love you,"I have a smile stretched from ear to ear. I see you walking down the road. We meet at the lights, I stare for a while. The world around us disappears. It's just you and me on my island of hope. A breath between us could be miles. Let me surround you, a sea to your shore. Let me be the calm you seek. But everytime I'm close to you. There's too much I can't say. And you just walk away. And I forgot to tell you. I love you. And night's too long. And cold here. Without you. I grieve in my condition. For I cannot find the words to say. I need you so. And everytime I'm close to you. There's too much I can't say. And you just walk away. And I forgot to tell you. I love you. And night's too long.

i will not forget you,"I remember those nights when i watched as you lay sleeping. your body gripped by some far away dream,. And i was so scared and so in love then,. And so lost in all of you that i had seen.. But no one ever talked in the darkness,. No voice ever added fuel to the fire,. No light ever shone in the doorway,. Deep in the hollow of earthly desire,. And if in some dream there was brightness,. If in some memory some sort of sign,. Then flesh be revived in the shadows,. And blessed our bodies would lay so entwined.. Chorus. And i will, oh i will not forget you.. nor will i ever let you go. I will, oh i will, not forget you.. I remember how you left in the morning at daybreak.. so silent you stole from my bed.. To go back to the one who posesses your soul. And i back to the life that i dread.. so i ran like the wind to the water. Please don't leave me again i cried,. and i threw bitter tears at the ocean. But all that came back was the tide.. Chorus x 2."
i will remember you,"I will remember you. Will you remember me?. Don't let you life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. I'm so tired but I can't sleep. Standing on the edge of something much too deep. It's funny how we feel so much but cannot say a word. We are screaming inside but we can't be heard. I will remember you. Will you remember me?. Don't let your life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. I'm so afraid to love you but more afraid to lose. Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose. Once there was a darkness deep and endless night. You gave me everything you had,oh you gave me light. And I will remember you. Will you remember me?. Don't let you life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. And I will remember you. Will you remember me?. Don't let life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. Weep not for the memories"

i'll take your breath,"Listen as the wind blows from across the great divide. voices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in time. the night is my companion, and solitude my guide. would I spend forever here and not be satisfied?. And I would be the one. to hold you down. kiss you so hard. I'll take your breath away. and after, I'd wipe away the tears. just close your eyes dear. Through this world I've stumbled. so many times betrayed. trying to find an honest word to find. the truth enslaved. oh you speak to me in riddles. and you speak to me in rhymes. my body aches to breathe your breath. your words keep me alive. And I would be the one. to hold you down. kiss you so hard. I'll take your breath away. and after, I'd wipe away the tears. just close your eyes dear. Into this night I wander. it's morning that I dread. another day of knowing of. the path I fear to tread. oh into the sea of waking dreams. I follow without pride. nothing stands between us here. and I won't be denied. and I would be the one. to hold you down. kiss you so hard.

I don't like your tragic sighs. as if your god has passed you by well hey fool. that's your deception. your angels speak with jilted tongues. the serpent's tale has come undone. you have no strength to squander.

illusions of bliss,"Here I go again…back into your arms. What ever happened to resolve?. For though I thought that I was strong, that I could carry on. Awash in the illusion of this bliss. Here I go again…back into the flame. Like a moth so willing to be burned. A little touch a little taste the pheromones embrace. And I get weak with every breathe I take. ‘Cause it’s you who released me. It’s you who gave me fire. Oh and now it’s impossible to grow. Without breaking stride…I get so high. Take me out beyond the incline. Make it past the former fault line. For today I let the moment win. Here I go again…saying things I shouldn’t say. Just so I can hear them back from you. Oh I know I shouldn’t stay I should be on my way. Back to a place I know is real. But the lines are getting blurred. My conscience wont be heard. Awash in the illusion of this bliss. And it’s you who released me. It’s you who gave me fire. Oh and now it’s impossible to grow. Without breaking stride…I get so high. Take me out beyond the incline. Make it past the former fault line. For today I let the moment win…"
in a bleak mid winter,"In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan. Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone. Snow had fallen, snow on snow. snow on snow. In the bleak mid-winter long ago. Angels and archangels may have gathered there. Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air. But His mother only in her maiden bliss. Worshiped the beloved with a kiss. Oh, what can I give Him, poor as I am?. If I were a shepherd, I would I bring a lamb. If I were a wise man I would I do my part. Yet what I can I give Him, give my heart. In the bleak midwinter, frosty winds made moan. Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone. If I were a wise man, would I do my part. Yet what I can I give Him, give my heart"

In the arms of an Angel fly away from here. From this dark, cold hotel room,. And the endlessness that you fear. You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of an Angel;. May you find some comfort here. So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn. There's vultures and thieves at your back. The storm keeps on twisting,. You keep on building the lies. That you make up for all that you lack. It don't make no difference, escaping one last time. It's easier to believe. In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness. That brings me to my knees. In the arms of an Angel far away from here. From this dark, cold hotel room,. And the endlessness that you fear. You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie. In the arms of an Angel;. May you find some comfort here. You're in the arms of an Angel;. May you find some comfort here"

Lost in the darkness of a land. Where all the hope that's offered is. Memories of being taken by the hand. And we are led into the sun. But I don't have a hold on what is real. Though we can only try. What is there to give or to believe. I want it all to go away, I want to be alone. Sympathy's wasted on my hollow shell. I feel there's nothing left to fight for. No reason for a cause. And I can't hear your voice, and I can't feel you near. Lost in the darkness of a land. Where all the hope that's offered is. Memories of being taken by the hand. And we are led into the sun. But I don't have a hold on what is real. Though we can only try. What is there to give or to believe. I wanted a change, knowing all I could do was try. I was looking for someone...."
love beside me,I know now there's no one here to blame. I could but what good would that do. It wouldn't change a thing. So I grew accustomed to the shame. The sharp sting of your poison. Trying so hard to erase. All the good in me. If this is love beside me. I'm working on forgiveness. Laying the past down behind me. Letting go the ways that I've been hurt. Let the rivers rise and rage. I'll try and stand with grace. If everything is love. In the end the war had left us broken. Mourning all the things I'd lost. The debts I couldn't pay. But I didn't want to disappear. I was caught in Tv static. Sinking into grey. No more to give away. If this is love beside me. I'm working on forgiveness. Laying the past down behind me. Letting go the ways that I've been hurt. Let the rivers rise and rage. I'll try to stand with grace. If everything is love. If this is love beside me. I'm working on forgiveness. Laying the past down behind me. Letting go the ways that I've been hurt. Let the rivers rise and rage. I'll try to stand with grace. If this is love beside me
love come,Love come light up the shadows. Let the beauty of you enter in. For I have hungered for a tender touch. A long and lonely time. I?ve seen much more than I want to. So much anger so much pain. A line is drawn ad lives are torn apart. The wounds too hard to heal. Love has taken me in. Lifted my load. And in this empty space a wonder grows. A dream of some kind of peace I could hold up as true. I never knew anything about love before you. You call and I come running. I can sense the flood before it breaks. And I?d do anything to dry your tears. To let you know you?re safe. Love has taken me in. Lifted my load. And in this empty space a wonder grows. A dream of some kind of peace I could hold up as true. I never know anything about love before you. Love come light up the shadows. Let the beauty of you enter in. For I have hungered for a tender touch. A long and lonely time
loving you is easy,"Loving you is easy.. Loving you is wondrous and pure.. I shout it from the rooftops,. 'How long must I wait 'til I see your smile'?. Light up in the moonlight,. Caught up in the sparkle in your eyes.. So wrong and I know I should go so,. But it's not like me to wait.. Cause I'm alive and I'm on fire.. Shout loud like the starburst into the sky.. Oh the fury of desire you burn so bright,. You electrify.. You line me up; you take me higher.. I've been down a long. And I've become a stranger to myself.. Digging in my heels and hoping time might be kinder. If I waited out.. Nothing came from wanting. And I became so small and insecure.. Didn't know the cost of all our lies. 'Til I found it fresh and new again with you.. And I'm on fire.. Shout loud like the starburst into the sky. Oh the fury of desire you burn so bright,. You electrify. You line me up; you take me higher.. Loving you is easy. Loving you is wondrous and pure. I shouted from the rooftops. 'How long must I wait 'til I see you smile?'"
mary,"Mary walks. down to the water's edge. and there she hangs her head. to find herself faded. a shadow of what she once was. She said ""How long have I been sleeping. and why do I feel so old. why do I feel so cold. my heart is saying one thing but my body won't let go"". With trembling hands she reaches up. a stranger's flesh is offered. and I would be the last to know. I would be the last the let it show. I would be the last to go. Take her hand. she will lead you through the fire. give you back hope. and hope that you won't take too much. respecting what is left. she cradled us. she held us in her arms. unselfish in her suffering she could not understand. that no one seemed to have the time. to cherish what was given. and I would be the last to know. and I would be the last to let it show. I would be the last to go.... Mary walks...."
mercy,"Mercy - pure and simple. Longing - cold and hollow. With sweet breath, you'd come come to warn me. But I held on too hard, to only a memory. You lie there on the swollen ground. Deserted in your heart. Still longing for what yesterday's lost. And for all that tomorrow might bring. And for all that tomorrow might bring. The passion lost - taken, stolen. The dreams we had, and we shared - shattered and broken. With kind words you'd come to soothe me. But I, so blind and filled with fear,. Would send you away from me. There's no hope in regretting now. All the pain that we could not see. We both knew what we wanted. And we took it, believing it free. And we took it, believing it free"
monsters,"When we were young. There were always creatures lurking under the bed. A thousand year old dragon lived deep in the lake. And he said ""don't be afraid"". So you dove in. He seemed so sweet and lovely he made you laugh. And made you forget about the rain. Showed you new tricks on guitar. Hidden talents that erases the pain. And don't you know that there's a wolf stalking in sheep's. Clothing tells me he's the real thing?. Think what your life would be missing. If you didn't have him to sing. To sing about. Three headed monsters. They want your money wanna be in the picture, be your friend. They fill your pool with alligators. Are they all just jokers or are they cruel?. They light up when they see you like there's no where else. That they'd rather be than by your side. Then they promise you the stars. But they're really just along for the ride. And don't you know that there's a wolf stalking in sheep's. Clothing tells me he's the real thing. Think what your life would be missing. If you didn't have him to sing. To sing about. Is it the sparkle in their eyes or the knowledge. Of the ways of the world. The way they kiss the way they hold you has made you. Blind to the fangs and the fire. There's a wolf stalking in sheep's. Clothing tells me he's the real thing. Think what your life would be missing. If you didn't have him to sing. To sing about"

o little town of bethlehem,"O little town of Bethlehem. How still we see thee lie. Above thy deep and dreamless sleep. The silent stars go by. Yet in thy dark streets shineth. The everlasting Light. The hopes and fears of all the years. Are met in thee tonight. For Christ is born of Mary. And gathered all above. While mortals sleep, the angels keep. Their watch of wondering love. O morning stars together. Proclaim the holy birth. And praises sing to God the King. And Peace to men on earth. How silently, how silently. The wondrous gift is given!. So God imparts to human hearts. The blessings of His heaven.. No ear may his His coming,. But in this world of sin,. Where meek souls will receive him still,. The dear Christ enters in.. O holy Child of Bethlehem. Descend to us, we pray. Cast out our sin and enter in. Be born to us today. We hear the Christmas angels. The great glad tidings tell. O come to us, abide with us. Our Lord Emmanuel"

ordinary miracle,It's not that usual when everything is beautiful. It's just another ordinary miracle today. The sky knows when its time to snow. You don't need to teach a seed to grow. It's just another ordinary miracle today. Life is like a gift they say. Wrapped up for you everyday. Open up and find a way. To give some of your own. Isn't it remarkable?. Like every time a raindrop falls. It's just another ordinary miracle today. Birds in winter have their fling. And always make it home by spring. It's just another ordinary miracle today. When you wake up everyday. Please don't throw your dreams away. Hold them close to your heart. Cause we are all a part. Of the ordinary miracle. Ordinary miracle. Do you want to see a miracle?. Its seems so exceptional. The things just work out after all. It's just another ordinary miracle today. The sun comes up and shines so bright. It disappears again at night. It's just another ordinary miracle today. It's just another ordinary miracle today. . [magaadati]
out of the shadows,"Crouching down inside a deep ravine. Those angry cries pass quickly by, can't be seen. So many ways spent hiding in so many undone plans. Forgetting what it's like to fight when no one understands. Close call there in the shadows. There's a fear in the dark. There's no one out there. All those feelings, pain and anger, flood back one by one. They must be just around the bend, they always come. At night as I lay sleeping they come to me in herds. Their lies remain, the dreams the same, it's only fleeting words. No one calls, there in the shadows. There's no end to the dark. 'Cause there's no one out there, no one but me.... The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me. No way's the right way, is there a way out for me. My life's slipping out.... Rising up, the night is done, and now the bright lights come. Held back in my pittied world where everything's undone. A cold wind blows right through me, I've made a hollow shell. There's nothing left, just ash remains, enrich the soul, no soul, no soul. Close call there in the shadows. There's an end to the dark. 'Cause there's someone out there, someone like me. The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me. No way's the right way, is there a way out for me. The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me. Is there a way out for me. The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me. Is there a way out for me. There must be a way out for me"
out of tune,"Behind our door, there’s no war. No burning towers, just hours of peace. Between us at least. No pretense no violence makes no sense. It isn’t my heart that’s grown cold. The same mistakes are getting old. I’m lost for words I don’t know what to do. But when I’m lying here with you. And the whole world’s out of tune. You’re the one and only voice that makes things right. So stay with me tonight. Behind our door there’s no hunger. No one trying to sell me heaven. Just loving arms it’s just tonight. I don’t want to hear ’bout our trying times. Don’t wanna know about lost children, about someone held for ransom. It isn’t my heart that’s grown cold. The same mistakes are getting old I’m lost for words. I don’t know what to do. But when I’m lying here with you. And the whole world’s out of tune. You’re the one and only voice that makes things right. So stay with me tonight"
path of thorns,"I knew you wanted to tell me. In your voice there was something wrong. But if you would turn your face away from me. You cannot tell me you're so strong. Just let me ask of you one small thing. As we have shared so many tears. With fervor our dreams we planned a whole life long. Now are scattered on the wind.... CHORUS. In the terms of endearment. In the terms of the life that you love. In the terms of the years that pass you by. In the terms of the reasons why. Through the years I've grown to love you. Though your commitment to most would offend. But I stuck by you holding on with my foolish pride. Waiting for you to give in.... You never really tried or so it seems. I've had more than myself to blame. I've had enough of trying everything. And this time it is the end.... CHORUS. There's no more coming back this way. The path is overgrown and strewn with thorns. They've torn the life-blood from your naked eyes. Cast aside to be forlorn.... CHORUS. Funny, how it seems that all I've tried to do. Seemed to make no difference to you at all..."

Am I good enough to belong. in your reverie, your perfect girl. your vision of romance is cruel. and all along I played the fool. all your expectations bury me. donâ€™t worry. Chorus:. you will find the answer if you let it go. give yourself some time to faulter. but donâ€™t follow this. donâ€™t let go your love no matter what. and everything will come around in time.

plenty,"I looked into your eyes. they told me plenty. I already knew. you never felt a thing. so soon forgotten all that you do. in more than words I. tried to tell you. the more I tried I failed. I would not let myself believe. that you might stray. and I would stand by you. no matter what they'd say, I would have thought I'd be with you. until my dying day. until my dying day. I used to think my life. was often empty. a lonely space to fill. you hurt me more than. I ever would have imagined. you made my world stand still. and in that stillness. there was a freedom. I never felt before. I would not let myself believe. that you might stray. and I would stand by you. no matter what they'd say, I would have thought I'd be with you. until my dying day. until my dying day."
possession,"Listen as the wind blows from across the great divide. voices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in time. the night is my companion, and solitude my guide. would I spend forever here and not be satisfied?. and I would be the one. to hold you down. kiss you so hard. I'll take your breath away. and after, I'd wipe away the tears. just close your eyes dear. Through this world I've stumbled. so many times betrayed. trying to find an honest word to find. the truth enslaved. oh you speak to me in riddles. and you speak to me in rhymes. my body aches to breathe your breath. your words keep me alive. And I would be the one. to hold you down. kiss you so hard. I'll take your breath away. and after, I'd wipe away the tears. just close your eyes dear. Into this night I wander. it's morning that I dread. another day of knowing of. the path I fear to tread. oh into the sea of waking dreams. I follow without pride. nothing stands between us here. and I won't be denied. and I would be the one. to hold you down. kiss you so hard. I'll take your breath away. and after, I'd wipe away the tears. just close your eyes...."
prayer of saint francis,"Lord make me an instrument of your peace,. Where there is hatred let me sow love.. Where there is injury, pardon.. Where there is doubt, faith.. Where there is despair, hope.. Where there is darkness, light.. And where there is sadness, joy.. O divine master grant that I may. not so much seek to be consoled as to console;. to be understood as to understand;. To be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive-. it is in pardoning that we are pardoned.. And it's in dying that we are born to eternal life.. Amen.."
push,"Every time I look at you the world just melts away. All my troubles all my fears dissolve in your. affections. You've seen me at my weakest but you take me as I am. And when I fall you offer my a softer place to land. You stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together. You're the one true thing I know I can believe in. You're all the things that I desire you save me you complete me. You're the one true thing I know I can believe. I get mad so easily but you give me room to breathe. No matter what I say or do 'cause you're too good to fight about it. Even when I have to push just to see how far you'll go. You won't stoop down to battle but you never turn to go. You stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together. You're the one true thing I know I can believe in. You're all the things that I desire you save me you complete me. You're the one true thing I know I can believe. Every stress we had to do, and nothing else could kill me. There are times I can't decide when I can't tell up from down. You make me feel less crazy when otherwise I'd drown. But you pick me up and brush me off and tell me I'm okay. Sometimes that's just what we need to get us through the day. You stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together. You're the one true thing I know I can believe in. You're all the things that I desire you save me you complete me. You're the one true thing I know I can believe"
river,"It's coming on Christmas. They're cutting down trees. They're putting up reindeer. And signing songs of joy and peace. Oh I wish I had a river. I could skate away on. But it don't snow here. It stays pretty green. I'm going to make a lot of money. Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene. Oh I wish I had a river. I could skate away on. I wish I had a river so long. I would teach my feet to fly. I wish I had a river. I could skate away on. I made my baby cry. Well she tried hard to help me. You know, she put me at ease. And she loved me so naughty. Made me weak in the knees. Oh I wish I had a river. I could skate away on. I'm so hard to handle. I'm selfish and I'm sad. Now I've gone and lost the best baby. That I ever had. Oh I wish I had a river. I could skate away on. I wish I had a river so long. I would teach my feet to fly. I wish I had a river. I could skate away on. I made my baby say goodbye.

rivers of love,There’s a tunnel that leads to the rivers of love. The sides make you bleed ‘til your white as a dove. Don’t bother to bring all the baggage you cling to. The porter will free you before you come through. The doorway that cleanses the darkness that mends. It’s easy to smile in the end…. And it all comes down to leaving it all behind and moving on. To the rivers of love. And never be lonely again. How long have you waited?. How long ‘til you drown?. The rules and directions the twists and corrections. Take tolls on the highs we still strive ‘til we die. To seek out the one love - the one that we dream of. The one may be there with you everyday. Alone and untethered and free of all ties. Free since the day you first cried. And it all comes down to leaving it all behind and moving on. To the rivers of love. And never be lonely again. How long have you waited?. How long ‘til you drown?. How long have you waited?. How long ‘til you drown?
sad clown,"A time so haunting, moonlight in the mist. Lay me down beside you, oh, as long as it lasts. From the river comes a figure, drifting slowly by. Trailing long the water, leaving softer than a sigh,. Softer than a sigh. All the feelings, they remain like a still life. A dying swan song, forever lost your cries of glory. The rain is falling down like silence in a shroud. When all that really matters left to loose. I'm all alone. I'm all alone. All the feelings, they remain like a still life. A dying swan song, forever lost your cries of glory. Walking from the shadows a fear of sadness grows. Your heart is in your hands, your knowing looks. Our time is gone. My time is gone. Swan's dying song"
shelter,"They're crowded into the smallest spaces. While outside all of nature cries. It's known to be cruel and unfair. But there is no place to hide. Oh, I've seen a part of people that I never really want to share. Oh, I've seen a part of people that I never knew was there. Shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm. Shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm. I can't sleep haunted by their faces. The sadness in their eyes. It hurts so much to see them helpless. It makes me want to cry. But still there is so much left unanswered. For so many innocent lives. They close the doors and are letting nobody in. And only the strong will survive.... Shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm. Give them shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm. I've seen the anger and I've seen all the dreams. And I've watched an existence torn apart at the seams. And though I may seam helpless. I will do all that I can do. Oh, I've seen a part of people that I never really want to share. Oh, I've seen a part of people that I never knew was there.... Shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm. Give them shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm. Shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm. Give them shelter - give them shelter from the coming storm."
silence,Give me release. witness me. I am outside. give me peace. Heaven holds a sense of wonder. and I wanted to believe. that I'd get caught up. when the rage in me subsides. In this white wave. I am sinking. in this silence. in this white wave. in this silence. I believe. Passion chokes the flower. 'til she cries no more. possessing all the beauty. hungry still for more. Heaven holds a sense of wonder.... I can't help this longing. comfort me. I can't hold it all in. if you won't let me. Heaven holds a sense of wonder.... In this white wave. I am sinking. in this silence. in this white wave. in this silence. I believe. I have seen you. in this white wave. you are silent. you are breathing. in this white wave. I am free.
silent night,"Silent night, holy night. All is calm, all is bright. Round yon virgin mother and child. Holy infant so tender and mild. Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace.

silver bells,"Every street corner you'll hear, you can hear. Silver bells, silver bells. It's Christmas time in the city. Ring-a-ling, hear them ring. Soon it will be Christmas day. City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style. In the air there's a feeling of Christmas. Children laughing, people passing. meeting smile after smile. And on every street corner you'll hear, you can hear. Silver bells, silver bells, silver bells, silver bells. It's Christmas time in the city. Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, hear them sing, hear them sing. Soon it will be Christmas day. Strings of streetlights even stop lights. blink a bright red and green.

Silver bells, the corner Santa Claus. silver bells, is busy now because. It's Christmas time in the city. Ring-a-ling, you'll hear it in the air, hear them ring. you'll hear it everywhere. Soon it will be Christmas day. Very soon it will be Christmas day"
song for a winter's night,"The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top. The snow is softly fallin'. The air is still within the silence of my room. I hear your voice softly callin'. If I could only have you near. To breathe a sigh or two. I would be happy just to hold the hands I love. Upon this winter night with you. The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead. My glass is almost empty. I read again between the lines upon the page. The words of love you sent me. If I could know within my heart. That you were lonely too. I would be happy just to hold the hands I love. Upon this winter night with you. The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim. The shades of night are liftin'. The mornin' light steals across my windowpane. Where webs of snow are driftin'. If I could only have you near. To breathe a sigh or two. I would be happy just to hold the hands I love. And to be once again with with you. To be once again with with you"
song for my father,How I wish that I could tell you. It's to you that I would run. You were the place that I could always rest my head. When my world had come undone. 'Cause I've been wrestling with my demons. They're telling me I have no choice. How I wish that I could lean upon you now. Amidst the chaos and the noise. Your light buried the dark. A constant unwavering heart. You were the well to cool my fury. Deep and calm your waters feel. Your quiet words a salve to soothe my wayward soul. It was there I learned to heal. Your light buried the dark. A constant unwavering heart. Oh I hope that you can hear me. Through the ravages of time. You have carried me though more than you could know. I still feel your hand in mine. Your light buried the dark. A constant unwavering heart
steaming,"You're always waiting on the tides. It's time you decide. I've walked down long roads. That seem to have no end at all. You never wanted time to end. To let my life offend. It's time to realize what hides. Deep inside your holy eyes. Hold on tight, hold on fast. This ain't the kind that always lasts. If you want me to go. Just ask me to go, I'll go.... All the way, my love. Over the hills and right on to you. Run away, my love. Over the hills and right on through you. Over the hills and right on through you. Lying awake in these restless dreams. Life's never what it seems. I've always tried to read your eyes. To get inside that scournful mind. Hold on tight, hold on fast. This ain't the kind that always lasts. If you want me to go. Just ask me to go, I'll go.... All the way, my love. Over the hills and right on through you. Run away, my love. Over the hills and right on through you.... I was with on that pallet, steaming. Spinning 'round in circles, dreaming. I was with on that pallet, steaming. Running 'round in circles, screaming. All the way, my love. Over the hills and right on through you.... All the way, my love. Over the hills and right on through you.... etc..."
strange world,We walk without a sound. Across a barren landscape. Your eyes are twisted down. To the dew entrailed ground. We watch the stars. As they slowly fade away. And in the clearing sky I see. The cold stone face of morning. Setting in on me. It's a strange world. It's a very strange world. That leaves me holding on. To nothing when there's nothing. Left to lose. Your touch is cold and damp. The devil's in your eyes. I wonder why I always. Let you lead me on this way. 'Cause you see only. What you want to see. Feel only as you want to. And I am on the outside. Of your strange world. It's a strange world. It's a very strange world. That leaves me holding on. To nothing when there's nothing. Left to lose. We're walking hand in hand. We'll walk this way forever. Our eyes have risen to the water's edge. Watching with the tides. The stars have fallen. To another day. And the sun warms our path to find. That reason leaves us far behind. In this strange world. It's a strange world. It's a very strange world. That leaves me holding on. To nothing when there's nothing. Left to lose
stupid,Night lift up the shades. let in the brilliant light of morning. but steady there now. for I am weak and starving for mercy. sleep has left me alone. to carry the weight of unravelling where we went wrong. it's all I can do to hang on. to keep me from falling. into old familiar shoes. [Chorus:]. how stupid could I be. a simpleton could see. that you're no good for me. but you're the only one I see. love has made me a fool. it set me on fire and watched as I floundered. unable to speak. except to cry out and wait for your answer. but you come around in your time. speaking of fabulous places. create an oasis. dries up as soon as you're gone. you leave me here burning. in this desert without you. [Chorus]. everything changes. everything falls apart. can't stop to feel myself losing control. but deep in my senses I know.
surrender and certainty,Smooth stones down by the waterside. Give in to ebb and flow. Collide in blindness embrace. And part no fear of letting go. There's no fight to get ahead. Nowhere that they'd rather be. Safe in the arms of surrender and certainty. Caught in a moment and sure they'll be carried. Take me back down to the water to feel that sure. Of anything. I write your name down in the swollen sand. And I walk out in the waves. I know you're here I feel you all around me. In this sea of soothing grey. I don't even feel the cold it's warm. As you wash over me. Safe in the arms of surrender and certainty. Caught in a moment and sure I'll be carried. Take me back down to the water to feel that sure. Of anything. Rain like tears stream down the windshield. As we pull out on the road. You were the star by which I light my way. So how do I find my way now?. Back in the arms of surrender and certainty. Caught in a moment but sure we'll be carried. I want to know what it feels like to be that sure. Of anything
sweet surrender,It doesn't mean much. it doesn't mean anything at all. the life I've left behind me. is a cold room. I've crossed the last line. from where I can't return. where every step I took in faith. betrayed me. and led me from my home. And sweet. sweet surrender. is all that I have to give. You take me in. no questions asked. you strip away the ugliness. that surrounds me. are you an angel. am I already that gone. I only hope. that I won't disappoint you. when I'm down here. on my knees. And sweet. sweet. sweet surrender. is all that I have to give. Sweet. sweet. sweet surrender. is all that I have to give. And I don't understand. by the touch of your hand. I would be the one to fall. I miss the little things. I miss everything (about you). It doesn't mean much. it doesn't mean anything at all. the life I left behind me. is a cold room. And sweet. sweet. sweet surrender. is all that I have to give.

the christmas song,"Ooh, hmm, oh yeah. Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost nipping at your nose. Yuletide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like Eskimos. Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe. Will help to make the season bright. And tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight, night. They know that Santa's on his way. He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is gonna spy. To see if reindeer really know how to fly. And so I'm offering this simple phrase. To kids from one to ninety-two, ooh yeah. Though its been said many times, many ways. Merry Christmas to you, ooh oh yeah, ooh oh yeah.

the path of thorns,"I knew you wanted to tell me. In your voice there was something wrong. But if you would turn your face away from me. You cannot tell me you're so strong.... Just let me ask of you one small thing. as we have shared so many tears. With ferver our dreams we planned a whole life long. Now are scattered on the wind.... In the terms of endearment. In the terms of the life that you love. In the terms of the years that pass you by. In the terms of the reasons why. Through the years I've grown to love you. Though your commitment to most would offend. But I stuck by you holding on with my foolish pride. Waiting for you to give in.... You never really tried, or so it seems. I've had more than myself to blame. I've had enough of trying everything. And this time it is the end.... In the terms of endearment. In the terms of the life that you love. In the terms of the years that pass you by. In the terms of the reasons why. There's no more coming back this way. The path is overgrown and strewn with thorns. They've torn the life blood from your naked eyes. Cast aside to be forlorn.... In the terms of endearment. In the terms of the life that you love. In the terms of the years that pass you by. In the terms of all the reasons why. In the terms of endearment. In the terms of the life that you love. In the terms of the years that pass you by. In the terms of all the reasons why. Funny, how it seems that all I've tried to do. Seemed to make no difference to you at all...."
the sound that love makes,"Can you hear it? This is the sound that love makes. The fingerprint of a snowflake. It paints a picture of you. Can you feel it? This is the flavor of sunshine. The way your body it moves mine. I can taste you in the coolest raindrops. One hand in the other unlike any other hand I know. I'm seeing the sun in all the darkest grey skies. This time I'm going in for the sweetest kill. I'm gonna eat till I get my fill. So delicious are my lips on your skin. One hand in the other unlike any other hand I know. I'm seeing the sun in all the darkest grey skies. Sweetness, this is the rhythm of thunder. From up above or down under. I love you"
time,"Time here. All but means nothing. Just shadows that move. Across the wall. They keep me company. But they don't ask of me. They don't say nothing at all. And I need just a little more silence. And I need just a little more time. You send your thieves to me. Silently stalking me. Dragging me into your world. Would you give me no choice in this?. I know you can't resist. Trying to reopen a sore. (Chorus). But leave me be. I don't want to argue. I just get confused. And I come all undone. And if I agree. Well it's just to appease you. `Cause I don't remember. What we're fighting for. You see love. The tight, thorny thread. That's just spin in a circle of gold. To have me, to hold me. A token for all to see. Captured to be yours alone. So I need just a little more silence. And I need just a little more time. Courage to pull away. There will be hell to pay. The deeper you cut to the bone. Chorus. Time here. All but means nothing. Just shadows that move. Across the wall. They keep me company. But they don't ask of me. They don't say nothing at all. So"
time after time,"Lying in my bed. I hear the clock tick. And think of you. Caught up in circles. Confusion is nothing new. Flashback. Warm nights. Almost left behind. Suitcase of memories. Time after. Sometimes you picture me. I'm walking too far ahead. You're calling to me. I can't hear. What you've said. Then you say. ""Go slow"". I fall behind. The second hand unwinds. Chorus (2x):. If you're lost. You can look. And you will find me. Time after time. If you fall. I will catch you. I'll be waiting. Time after time. After my picture fades. And darkness. Has turned to gray. Watching through windows. You're wondering if i'm ok. Secrets stolen. From deep inside. The drum beats out of time. (Chorus). You said. ""Go slow"". I fall behind. The second hand unwinds. (Chorus 2x)"
train wreck,"Your love in all it's finery. Tear up the darkness all around me. Until I can breathe again. Until I believe again. Cause I'm a train wreck. Waiting to happen. Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks. A wild fire born of frustration. Born of a world, oh, that gets me so high. I've no fear at all. But your eyes like midnight fireflys. Light up the trenches where our loves lies. Until I can see again. Find my way back again. Cause I'm a train wreck. Waiting to happen. Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks. A wild fire born of frustration. Born of a world, oh, that gets me so high. I've no fear at all. To fall so deep into you. Loose myself completely. In your sweet embrace. All my pain's erased. And your mouth, it's all that I wish. Mercy of your lips, just one kiss. Until I can breathe again. Until I can sing again. Cause I'm a train wreck. Waiting to happen. Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks. A wild fire born of frustration. Born of a world, oh, that gets me so high. I've no fear at all. To fall so deep into you. Loose myself completely. In your sweet embrace."

trust,"Somewhere deep inside me. I hold a picture of a time long gone. A time of ease and simple pleasures. And days in shadows not so long. Now with my mind I'm struggling,. Holding on to what I believe. Listen to the fragments of my thoughts. That leave me broken and decieved. 'Cause I don't know the way. He said ""I can take you there,. I can show you places where. Our time has had no ware"". And as we walked the plains. The skies, they open wide. Revealing all the shame. For what's been lost inside us all. It's a day in the life. In my mind I've seen it all. Sometime soon for all to see. The walls are slowly breaking down. In my mind I've seen it all. And someday we'll be free. We're searching for a message. Or so I thought, but so it seems. The ignorance in the myths of others. Is easier to redeem. I've never questioned the answers given. To find the faith that's been lost within. 'Cause where I lay my trust in others. Where it lies the ground is thin.... 'Cause I don't know the way. He said ""I can take you there,. I can show you places where. Our time has had no ware"". And as we walked the plains. The skies, they open wide. Revealing all the shame. For what's been lost inside us all. It's a day in the life. In my mind I've seen it all. Sometime soon for all to see. The walls are slowly breaking down. In my mind I've seen it all. And someday we'll be free. It's a day in the life. In my mind I've seen it all. Sometime soon for all to see. The walls are slowly breaking down. In my mind I've seen it all. And someday we'll be free. I know you say you love me. If what you say is true. So show me something that's not deceiving. 'Cause I wouldn't lie to you. It's a day in the life. In my mind I've seen it all. Sometime soon for all to see. The walls are slowly breaking down. In my mind I've seen it all. And someday we'll be free. It's a day in the life. In my mind I've seen it all. Sometime soon for all to see. The walls are slowly breaking down. In my mind I've seen it all. And someday we'll be free"
turn the lights down low,"Night falls heavy like an iron fist. The silence taut and frail. I weigh the depths of love and terror. In this test I cannot fail. 'Cause there's no map to guide the human heart. Down roads we've never been. Sometimes I feel I'm running blind but I'm trying. So turn the lights down low. Let the night come easy. Take my hand, won't you let me in?. 'Cause when the world comes crashing. Down inside your head. I'll be right here. Right here for you. Words fall heavy out of tired mouths. Resigned to rage and roar. I see behind your eyes the tempest rising. And I can't reach your shore. When all my good intentions fall apart. And I wind up on my knees. There's nothing gained from being right but I'm trying. So turn the lights down low. Let the night come easy. Take my hand won't you let me in. 'Cause when the world comes crashing. Down inside your head. I'll be right here. Right here for you. So turn the lights down low. Let the night come easy. Take my hand won't you let me in. 'Cause when the world comes crashing. Down inside your head. I'll be right here. I'll be right here for you. Take my hand won? t you let me in. 'Cause when the world comes crashing. Down inside your head. I'll be right here, I'll be right here waiting. Right here for you"
u want me 2,"You walk on by. Clueless and so high. Following your aimless path away from us. You're so far away. And what can I say. Cause I can't be the one you wanted me to be. So tell me how do you feel. It's so confusing. If you let it all go, it'll fall apart. Do you want me to stay and say I still want you. You want me too, don't you?. So what are we saying. Our eden's a failure. A made-up story to fit the picture-perfect world. The one with ""I do""s. and I love you. And we are made for each other. Is forever over now?. And tell me how do you feel. It's so confusing. If you let it all go, it'll fall apart. Do you want me to stay and say I still want you. You want me too, don't you?. I hope there's forgiveness. In the distance between us. Can we make what lies ahead of us a better place to be?. So tell me, how do you feel. It's so confusing. If you let it all go, it'll fall ---. Do you want me to stay and say I still want you. You want me too, don't you?. . (Juliane)"
vox,"In the desert of my dreams I saw you there. And I'm walking towards the water steaming body cold and bare. But your words cut loose the fire and you left my soul to bleed. And the pain that's in your truth's deceiving me, has got me scared. Oh Why?. Through your eyes the strains of battle like a brooding storm. You're up and down these pristine velvet walls like focus never forms. My walls are getting wider and my eyes are drawn astray. I see you now a vague deception of a dying day. Oh Why?. I fall into the water and once more I turn to you. And the crowds were standing, staring, faceless, cutting off my view to you. They start to limply flail their bodies in a twisted mime. And I'm lost inside this tangled web in which I've lain entwined. You're gone and I'm lost inside this tangled web in which I've lain entwined. Oh Why?"
wait,Under a blackened sky. far beyond the glaring streetlights. sleeping on empty dreams. the vultures lie in wait. You lay down beside me then. you were with me every waking hour. so close I could feel your breath. When all we wanted was the dream. to have and to hold that precious little thing. like every generation yields. the new born hope unjaded by their years. Pressed up against the glass. I found myself wanting sympathy. but to be consumed again. oh I know would be the death of me. and there is a love that's inherently given. a kind of blindness offered to appease. and in that light of forbidden joy. oh I know I won't receive it. When all we wanted was the dream. to have and to hold that precious little thing. like every generation yields. the newborn hope unjaded by their years. You know if I leave you now. it doesn't mean that I love you any less. it's just the state I'm in. I can't be good to anyone else like this. When all we wanted was the dream. to have and to hold that precious little thing. like every generation yields. the new born hope unjaded by their years....

what's it gonna take,"Since I was a girl I dreamed of a different life. Far away in the lights. But now I'm here staring into the face of the unknown. And who was I to think I could fool them. When I don't even know who I am. What's it gonna take to make me worthy. What's it gonna take to make me strong. I don't have much to give, I've only just begun to live. So how do I become somebody new. How do I begin to make this happen. How will I believe and see this through. When I feel so unready and I feel so alone. Back on solid ground my head is spinning 'round. My heart is in two different worlds. But I'm still here wondering where I fit into the madness. I thought when I was home I'd see clearly. But there's so much I don't understand. What's it gonna take to lift the darkness. What's it gonna take to light my way. I have so much to give, I've only just begun to live. So how do I begin my life anew. How do I begin to make this happen. How do I believe and see this through. Cause I feel like I'm ready but I still feel unsure"
