thank god for girls,"The girl in the pastry shop with the net in her hair. Is making a cannoli for you. To take on your hiking trip in the woods. With your bros that you've known since second grade. And you may encounter dragons and ruffians. And be called upon to employ your testosterone. In a battle for supremacy and access to females. Glued to the tv. And even if you are victorious. You may receive many cuts, bruises, and scrapes. And you will require band-aids and antiseptic ointments. And tender love and kisses on your stab wounds. And when you come home, she will be there. Waiting for you with a fire in her eyes. And a big fat cannoli to shove in your mouth. And that's why you. Thank god for girls. Halle jesu christe. From tennessee to la. Thank god for girls.

(thank god for girls). I'm so glad I got a girl to think of. Even though she isn't mine. I think about her all the day and all the night. It's enough to know that she's alive. She says I give her sweaty palms. She almost had a heart attack. The truth is that I'm just as scared I don't know how to act. I wish that I could get to know her better. But meeting up in real life'll cause the illusion to shatter. I carved her name into all the trees. I sang a song down on one knee. Looking at the underwear page in the sears catalog. Like when I was 14. I'm levitating like a magnet turned the wrong way around. I'm like an indian fakir trying to meditate. On a bed of nails with my pants pulled down. (chorus). Thank god for girls.

Microwaved it on the popcorn setting. While adam was like. "" (woo-hoo) that really hurt!. (going off into the tundra). So pissed at god. And he started lighting mighty forest fires. Stealing osprey eggs. Messing with the bees who were trying to pollinate. The echinacea. Until god said. ""I'ma smite you with loneliness. And break your heart in two"". And adam wept and wailed. Tearing out his hair. Falling on his knees, looked to the sky and said. ""thank god"""

Tell me what to do. Now the tank is dry. Now the wheel is flat. And you know what else?. Guess what I received in the mail today?. Words of deep concern from my little brother. The building's not goin' as it's planned. The foreman has injured his hand. The dozer will not clear its path. The driver swears he learned his math. The workers are goin' Home!"

And then my heart stopped:. ""Listening to Cho-Cho San fall in love all over again."". (Chorus). How stupid is it. I can't talk about it. I gotta sing about it. And make a record of my heart. How stupid is it. Won't you gimme a minute. Just come up to me. And say hello (to my heart). How stupid is it. For all I know you want me too. Or maybe you just don't know what to do. And maybe you're scared to say. I'm falling for you. I wish I could get my head outta the sand. 'cause I think we'd make a good team. And you would keep my fingernails clean. But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize. 'cause I can't even look in your eyes without shakin'. And I ain't fakin'. I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon. (Chorus)."

viva la vida (cover),"I used to rule the world. Seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning I sleep alone. Sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice. Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listened as the crowd would sing. Now the old king is dead long live the king. One minute I held the key. Next the walls were closed on me. And I discovered that my castles stand. Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing. Roman cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. Missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. Once you'd gone there was never. Never an honest word. And that was when I ruled the world. It was a wicked and wild wind. Blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums. People couldn't believe what I'd become. Revolutionaries wait. For my head on a silver plate.

heart songs,"Gordon Lightfoot. Sang a song. About a boat. That sank in the lake. At the break. Of the morning. A Cat named Stevens. Found a faith. He could believe in. And Joan Baez. I never listened. too much jazz. But hippie songs. Could be heard. In our pad. Eddie Rabbitt sang. About how much. He loved a rainy night. Abba, Devo, Benatar. Were there the day. John Lennon died. Mr. Springsteen said. He had a hungry heart. Grover Washington. Was happy on the day. He topped the charts. These are the songs. (Chorus:). These are my heart songs. They never feel wrong. And when I wake. For goodness sake. These are the songs. I keep singin'. Quiet Riot got me started. With the bangin' on my head. Iron Maiden, Judas Priest. And Slayer. Taught me how to shred. I gotta admit though. Sometimes. I would listen. To the radio. Debbie Gibson. Tell me that you think. We're all alone. Michael Jackson's. In the mirror. I've gotta have faith. If I wanna see clear. Never gonna give you up. Wish me love. Or wishing well. It takes two to make. A thing go right. If the Fresh Prince. Starts a fight. Don't you worry. For too long. 'Cause you know. These are the songs. (Chorus). Back in 1991. I wasn't havin' any fun. 'Till my roommate said. ""Come on and put. a brand new record on"". Had a baby on it. He was naked on it. Then I heard the chords. That broke the chains. I had upon me. Got together with my bros. In some rehearsal studios. Then we played. Our first rock show. And watched the fan base. Start to grow. Signed the deal that gave. The dough to make. A record of our own. The song come. On the radio. Now people go. This is the song. These are my heart songs. They never feel wrong. And when I wake. For goodness sake. These are the songs. I keep singing. (4x):. These are the songs. I keep singing"

Stealing osprey eggs. Messing with the bees who were trying to pollinate. The echinacea. Until god said. ""I'ma smite you with loneliness. And break your heart in two"". And adam wept and wailed. Tearing out his hair. Falling on his knees, looked to the sky and said. ""thank god"""

unbreak my heart,"Don't leave me in all this pain. Don't leave me out in the rain. Come back and bring back my smile. Come and take these tears away. I need your arms to hold me now. The nights are so unkind. Bring back those nights when I held you beside me. Un-break my heart. Say you'll love me again. Un-do this hurt you caused. When you walked out the door.

viva la vida (cover),"I used to rule the world. Seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning I sleep alone. Sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice. Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listened as the crowd would sing. Now the old king is dead long live the king. One minute I held the key. Next the walls were closed on me. And I discovered that my castles stand. Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing. Roman cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. Missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. Once you'd gone there was never. Never an honest word. And that was when I ruled the world. It was a wicked and wild wind. Blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums. People couldn't believe what I'd become. Revolutionaries wait. For my head on a silver plate. Just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh who would ever want to be king?. I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing. Roman cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. I know St Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word. But that was when I ruled the world. Hear Jerusalem bells are ringing.

where's my sex?,"Mom made my sex. She knitted it with her hands. Sex-making is. A family tradition. Going back to the caveman days. They were walking around in a haze. Until they figured it out. And they said. ""Gosh dang, this is great!"". But now I'm like a prehistoric screwball. Walking 'round with no sex at all, I said. Where's my sex?. I thought it was here. Under the bench. But it isn't there. I've got no idea where it disappeared to. I'm running late, I can't be late. I can't go out without my sex. It's cold outside if my toes get wet. And people will think that I'm an alien. Just cruising in to make a friend. Meg likes to hide it. She says that it gives her a kick. It may be under the rug. Or stuck in a shoe closet. Or tumbling round in the washing machine. She's always trying to get me clean. She adds detergent and Bounce to eliminate static cling. It's gonna be another hour or more. Till I am ready to walk out the door, I said. Where's my sex?. I thought it was here. Under the bench. But it isn't there. I've got no idea where it disappeared to. I'm running late, I can't be late.
