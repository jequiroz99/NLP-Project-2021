stranger things,"How long since the day. You'd gone with no sign. Oh how many tears. Must flow from our eyes. There's something in Mirkwood. It's fed on our fears. We won't let you down. In this promise to you. Cause friends do not lie. Please, we need to know where do you hide. I don't know who to believe. So I follow my instincts. They say that I am crazy. But I know what I have seen. They try to convince me you're dead. But I'll never accept these lies. Mystery, oh, mystery. All the stranger things since you were gone. Watching the lights. I find you. Are you alive?. (Eleven). (Eleven). Watching her eyes. I may hear you breathing. So here is our plan. We're not playing safe. Our compasses guide us. Into the unknown. A gate to the shadows. May swallow our souls. We won't let you down. In this promise to you. Cause friends do not lie. As the night arrives. The creature walks around. It may be here right now. In the World Upside down"
