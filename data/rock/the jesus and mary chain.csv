guitarman,"Well I quit my job down at the carwash. Left my mother a goodbye note. By sundown I left Kingston with my guitar under my coat. Hitchiked all the way down to Memphis. Got a room at the YMCA. For the next three weeks went hunting at nights. Just looking for a place to play. Well I thought my picking would set them on fire. But nobody wanted to hire a guitarman. Well I nearly starved to death down in Memphis. I run out of money and luck. So I bummed me a ride down to Mecon, Georgia. On an overloaded poultry truck. Thumbed on down to Panama City. Started picking at some of them all night bars. Hoping I could make myself a dollar making music on my guitar. Got the same old story the moment I'd appear. There ain't room around here for a guitarman. Don't need a guitarman son. So I slept in the hobo jungles. I roamed thousand miles of track. Till I find myself in Mobile, Alabama. At a club they call Big Jacks. A little four piece band was jamming. So I took my guitar and I sat in. I showed em what a band would sound like. With a swinging little guitarman. Show em son. If you ever take a trip down to the ocean. Find yourself down around Mobile. Make it on out to a club called Jacks. If you got a little time to kill. Just follow that crowd of people. You'll wind up out on his dance floor. Digging the finest little five piece group. Up and down the Gulf of Mexico. Guess who's leading that five piece band. Wouldn't you know it's that swinging little guitarman. ""he was a degenerates degenerate""."
halfway to crazy,sung by Jim. Crazy I'm halfway to crazy. Suicide could save me. Oh is that much too extreme. It's such a sad and sorry scene. Lovers tongue tied. And tied to the tongue. Making deals going bad by the dawn. Every dog must have it's day. And then it's got to pay and pay. That's me being torn at the seams. Going mad in the middle of a dream. Catch me getting it wrong from the start. Catch me 'cause I'm falling apart. Crazy I'm halfway to crazy. Suicide would waste me. Homicide would break me. Tongue tied and tied to the tongue. Oh is life as bad as dreams. I guess that's just the way it seems.
happy place,"I'm going back to a happy place. All my life I've lived to taste. Someone else's flavours on my tongue. Cherry take me back to the start of it all. Where everyone's up then everyone falls. Almost could destroy me with her kiss. Oh, I wish that I could feel. And I feel too real. For this grey moat. And me, I'm drifting like the sun. Down on everyone, the TV sky. Save me. Come and save me. Come on touch me. Come on and touch me. Come on hold me. Come on and hold me. I live my life for something I can't see. Let me take you in my summer dream."
happy when it rains,"sung by Jim. Step back and watch the sweet thing. breaking everything she sees. she can take my darkest feeling. tear it up till i'm on me knees. plug into her electric cool. where things bend and break. and shake to the rule. talking fast couldn't tell me something. i would shed my skin for you. talking fast on the edge of nothing. i would break my back for you. don't know why, don't know why. things vaporise and rise to the sky. and we tried so hard. and we looked so good. and we lived our lives in black. but something about you felt like pain. you were my sunny day rain. you were the clouds in the sky. you were the darkest sky. but your lips spoke gold and honey. that's why i'm happy when it rains. i'm happy when it pours. looking at me enjoying something. that feels like feels like pain. to my brain. and if i tell you something. you take me back to nothing. i'm on the edge of something. you take me back. and i'm happy when it rains."

And the way I feel tonight. I could die and I wouldn't mind. And there's something going on inside. Makes you want to feel makes you want to try. Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky. I can't stand up I can't cool down. I can't get my head off the ground. As soon as I get my head round you. I come around catching sparks off you. And all I ever got from you. Was all I ever took from you. And the world could die in pain. And I wouldn't feel no shame. And there's nothing holding me to blame. Makes you want to feel makes you want to try. Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky. I'm taking myself to the dirty part of town. Where all my troubles can't be found.
heat,If I could live for 100 years. Still I couldn't understand my fears. Never had the time or an easy ride. Kicking up the noise of a suicide. And I see the heat coming down.

She's keeping time keeping time. With the mystery rhyme. And she's crazy to want me to taunt me. Deep on the scene she is waiting for me. Like a sin scraping skin. She is screaming for me. Hope in hope in the sky she is talking to me. She's keeping time keeping time. With the image of me. It's her way of saying a prayer for me. It's her way of talking to God for me. It's her way of talking to jesus christ. It's her way of talking to jesus.

The heat sticks to summer's heavy sweat. Hang around it'll get hotter yet. You got the shakes and it's gonne get worse. Don't you know it's all a part of the curse. She's got the hit that takes you into space. Suck mud and make a deal for that taste. You got nothing but you're riding on a star. You couldn't guess that she could take you that far. Some things are so hard to say. Even though you'd say them every day. Don't let your life be the butt of a joke. Get your lips round a cool black Pepsi Coke. Here she comes.

tower of song,"Well my friends are gone, my hair is grey. And I ache in all the places where I used to play. And I'm crazy for love, but I'm not coming on. I'm just paying my rent every day in the tower of song. I said to Hank Williams, ""how lonely does it get?"". Hank Williams hasn't answered yet. But I hear him coughing all night long. A one hundred floors above me in the, in the tower of song. Come on. I was born like this, I had no choice. I was born with the gift of a golden voice. And twenty seven angels from the great beyond. They tied me to this table right here in the tower of song. So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll. I'm very sorry baby doesn't look like me at all. And I'm standing by the window where the light is strong. They don't let a woman kill you, not in the tower of song. Come on. Now you can say that I've grown bitter, hut of this you maybe sure. The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor. And there's a mighty judgement coming, but I maybe wrong. You see I hear these funny voices in the tower of song. Now I bid you farewell I don't know when I'll be back. They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track. But you'll be hearing from me baby long after I'm gone. I'll be speaking to you sweetly from my window in the tower of song. Come on."

And slide right through me. Oh honey through me. Away from you. She's a head I couldn't kick. She's a head to make you sick. It's a chance I never took. When she caught me with that look. It's a sin I've never seen. And she tells me how it's been. I'm in deep up to my head. Give it all until I'm dead. Don't expect to get inside me. This is all I've got to give. Hit me again and again. Slip right to me. And slide right through me. Oh honey through me. Away from you. Tumbledown.

I could only reach up high. It's so hard not to see you somewhere. Look around and I see you somewhere. In all the forests and the fields. Break my feelings, melting on a spear. And if you step beyond your face. You'll not find an empty place. All the things you've said and done. Spark prying privilege flying from my gun. You're up too high. You're up too high. You're up too high. High. And if I see you in a dream. My mind you'll quake. I'll never wake"
