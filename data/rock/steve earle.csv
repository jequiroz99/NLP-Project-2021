the galway girl,"Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk. Of a day -I-ay-I-ay. I met a little girl and we stopped to talk. Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay. And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do. 'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue. And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl. 'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl. We were halfway there when the rain. came down. Of a day -I-ay-I-ay. And she asked me up to her flat downtown. Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay. And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do. 'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue. So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl. And I lost my heart to a Galway girl. When I woke up I was all alone. With a broken heart and a ticket home. And I ask you now, tell me what would you do. If her hair was black and her eyes were blue. I've traveled around I've been all over this world. Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl"
someday,"There ain't a lot that you can do in this town. You drive down to the lake and then you turn back around. You go to school and you learn to read and write. So you can walk into the county bank and sign away your life. I work at the fillin' station on the interstate. Pumpin' gasoline and countin' out of state plates. They ask me how far into Memphis son, and where's the nearest beer. And they don't even know that there's a town around here. Someday I'm finally gonna let go. 'Cause I know there's a better way. And I wanna know what's over that rainbow. I'm gonna get out of here someday. Now my brother went to college cause he played football. I'm still hangin' round cause I'm a little bit small. I got me a 67 Chevy, she's low and sleek and black. Someday I'll put her on that interstate and never look back."
i love you too much,"Ooh pretty baby what you doin' to me. The way your kisses burn right through me. I don't think I can last much longer. I get weaker and my love gets stronger. I don't think that my heart can take it. One little slip of a word might break it. Well believe me baby this ain't no crush. I think maybe I love you too much. Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much. Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much. I tell myself that it ain't no big thing.

some dreams,"When I was a little guy. My daddy told me ""Mister,. Don't ever try to climb too high. 'Cause it's the fall that gets ya. And some dreams can never come true. They'll never come true"". Well, I heard every word he said. But I don't guess I listened. But every time I banged my head. Against the wall or system. Yeah, some dreams don't ever come true. Don't ever come true. But some dreams do. If you just hang on. And your heart is true. And your hope is strong. Well, just because you've been around. And had your poor heart broken. That's no excuse for lyin' there.

Girl I won't say, I'm hurtin' more. I know that you've heard all that before. So go on believe what you wanna believe. But I'm hurtin' you then I'm hurtin' me. I know it's hard to keep hanging on.

ft. worth blues,"In Ft. Worth all the neon's burnin' bright. Pretty lights red and blue. But they'd shut down all the honky tonks tonight. And say a prayer or two. If they only knew. You used to say the highway was your home. But we both know that ain't true. It's just the only place a man can go. When he don't know where he's travelin' to. But Colorado's always clean and healin'. And Tennessee in Spring is green and cool. It never really was your kind of town. But you went around with the Ft. Worth Blues. Somewhere up beyond the great divide. Where the sky is wide and the clouds are few. A man can see his way clear to the light. Just hold on tight. That's all you gotta do. And they say Texas weather's always changin'. And one thing change'll bring is somethin' new. And Houston really ain't that bad a town. So you hang around with the Ft. Worth Blues. There's a full moon over Galway Bay tonight. Silver light over green and blue. And every place I travel through, I find. Some kinda sign that you've been through. But Amsterdam was always good for grieving. And London never fails to leave me blue. Paris never was my kinda town. So I walked around with the Ft. Worth Blues."
the seeker,"I was eight years old when my granddaddy died. He that showed me the signs I still miss him sometimes. Been a long time ago but his words still ring true. Whatever you do be a seeker. All these years I have wandered and wherever I roamed. I was never alone or forsaken I know. Somewhere way out yonder I know I will find. That a bright beacon shines for a seeker. You can’t always believe your eyes. It’s your heart that sees through all the lies. And the first answer follows the first question asked. The mystery unmasked by the seeker. In a world full of sorrow, hunger and pain. It’s so hard to explain why I’m still travelin’. But there’s a new day tomorrow and maybe I’ll hold. Something brighter than gold to a seeker"

Each and every time we meet. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you. There you are. Right across the room from me. Just the way I knew you'd be. Lookin' lonesome wild and blue. I'm alright so far. Just as long as you don't speak. That's what makes my knees go weak. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you. I've done everything I know. To get you off my mind. But sometimes I can't help but hope. That you won't walk away this time. Then I wouldn't have to watch you go. Wouldn't have to miss you so. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you. If I knew what I know now. I'd never let you leave. I'd make it up to you somehow. And darlin' you'd come back to me. Then I wouldn't have to watch you go. Wouldn't have to miss you so. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you. I wouldn't need to be so blue. Wouldn't want you like I do. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you.

dixieland,"I am Kilrain and I'm a fightin' man and I come from County Clare. And the Brits would hang me for a Fenian so I took me leave of there. And I crossed the ocean in the ""Arrianne"" the vilest tub afloat. And the captain's brother was a railroad man and he met us the boat. So I joined up with the 20th Maine like I said my friend I'm a fighting man. And we're marchin' south in the pouring rain and we're all goin' down to Dixieland. I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine and we fight for Chamberlain. ‘Cause he stood right with us when the Johnnies came like a banshee on the wind. When the smoke cleared out of Gettysburg many a mother wept. For many a good boy died there, sure, and the air smelted just like death. I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine and I'd march to hell and back again. For Colonel Joshua Chamberlain - we're all goin' down to Dixieland. I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine and I damn all gentlemen. Whose only worth is their father's name and the sweat of a workin' man. Well we come from the farms and the city streets and a hundred foreign lands. And we spilled our blood in the battle's heat. Now we're all Americans. I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine and did I tell you friend I'm a fightin' man. And I'll not be back this way again, ‘cause we're all goin' down to Dixielan."
a bible and a gun,"There's a full moon out tonight. And it's shining down on me. And in that purest light. Any fool could see. That this highway is paved with sorrow. And every mile is lined with pain. And when the sun comes up tomorrow. You'll be just as far away. Now I hear her whisper soft and low. Through every mile I run. As I travel through this world of woe. With a Bible and a gun. If a man was made to suffer. I'm a mighty man I know. From one heartache to another. I've been burnin' down this road. I've got one eye on the mirror. And one eye on the line. The end keeps growin' nearer. The past slips behind. I don't mean to hurt nobody. I don't mean to do no wrong. But somethin' out there's got me. And it's pulling me along. Darkness is my shelter. Emptiness my light. And stranger, heaven help you. If our paths cross tonight"

a country song,"A country song left the farm. As the young man marched to war. Became a sound heard clear around the world. From a lonely soldiers guitar. Who had never been so far before. For mom and dad and a special little girl. And cutting through the quiet like a whistle in the night. A train of memories and even city boys could ride. Chorus:. Mountain high, valley low. Proud and strong, a country song. Meanwhile cross the water. The mothers and the daughters. Were working in the defense factories. All up and down the line. The machines and women whined. A country song as blue as the sea. That stretched so far between. Like the prayers and the dreams. Of the men who where fighting to keep their country free. Chorus. Though it seemed to take forever. They were finally back together. And the young men took a restless look around. cause it seemed the world unfolded. And the land just couldnt hold em. So they headed for the cities and the towns. They could feel the homefires glow. As they gathered around the radio. To hear the grand old opry as the weekend rolled around. Chorus. Theres a kid out on the highway. Who says hes got some dues to pay. So he set out with a guitar and a dream. He dont look much like a cowboy. But he swears hes gonna make some noise. Change a tune or two in tennessee. Though his hands had never worked the land. His granddad was a railroad man. He sang him jimmie rodgers songs as he sat upon his knee. Chorus x 2"
a far cry from you,"Blinded by the tears the day you left. Memories, like a stone around my neck. I never thought that I would ever get. As far away from you as I now have. . Chorus. A far cry from you. I mustve cried a river of regrets. Its water underneath the bridge, and thats. A far cry from from you. Far away from you enough to sigh. I laugh at all the tears you made me cry. But now even the echoes have all died. Im looking back with no tears in my eyes. Chorus 2X"
a little bit in love,"I dont fall in love as a rule. Because it always makes me look like a fool. Well, it keeps me up late. I cant concentrate. And I pride myself on keepin my cool. But I got to admit. Im just a little bit in love with you. Now, I dont want you gettin me wrong. Because I dont sit up at night by the phone. Well, if you come around. I let my guard down. And I just cant seem to leave you alone. But Ill get over it. Im just a little bit in love with you. Well, I tell myself that a little bit of love. Cant hurt a big man like me. But I never have heard of a little heart ache. And baby, thats whats scarin me. So dont you get your hopes up if I call. Because I always catch myself when I fall. But I got to admit. That Im a little bit in love with you. So dont you get your hopes up if I call. Because I always catch myself when I fall. But I got to admit. That Im a little bit in love with you. Oh, honey, thats all you get. Im just a little bit in love with you"
all of my life,"I guess I don't get out too much. If it wasn't enough I hear all these voices. Always tellin' me that I'm bad. But it's all in my head - like all those scary noises. chorus. I've been waiting all of my life. All of my life. I've been waiting all of my life. All of my life. Some nights when I'm laying in bed. Wish I was dead - and I know you'd never miss me. But I know where you go when you dream. Strange as that seems 'cause I never even kissed you. chorus. Everybody wants to be somebody's somethin'. Ain't nobody wants to be blue. Ain't nobody anywhere ever loved nothin'. Half as much as I love you. Somebody somewhere said "";love is a prison"";. But no one really wants to be free. I'd have to be crazy to ever think someone. Could love a nobody like me. I'm here alone in the dark. But I know where you are. 'Cause I can hear you breathin'. Come a little closer you'll find. You were meant to be mine. 'Cause you're the only reason. chorus 2x"

Four score and a hundred and fifty years ago. Our forefathers made us equal as long as we can pay. Yeah, well maybe that wasn't exactly what they was thinkin'.

angry young man,"Got a lot of memories tied up in this place. So much time spent in so little space. What looked like the world through the eyes of a child. Kind of closes in on you after awhile. It's a place to grow up and a place to grow old. You keep your mouth shut and you do what you're told. I told mama the day that I ran. This ain't no place for an angry young man. Mama if you could see me right now. You'd be so sure you failed me somehow. Mama you never could understand. There ain't no peace for an angry young man. A cheap hotel a long way from my home. So many people make you feel so alone. Dreams die easy out here in these streets. And hearts grow cold in the city heat. I ain't never been the patient kind. I got to live like I please or die tryin'. At a filling station with a gun in my hand. The only way for an angry young man. Got a lot of memories tied up in this place. Tonight they're starin' me right in the face. A lonely grave on the outskirts of town. It's three in the morning, ain't no one around. Just like a ghost I come out of the night. But I'll be gone before the morning light. Mama I hope that you understand. This ain't no place for an angry young man."

another town,"One of these days when my minds made up. And I'm sick and tired of hangin' around. I'll be on my way in a cloud of dust. On the road to another town. Once upon a time I loved this house. Now I'm thinkin' 'bout burnin' it down. And I'll be long gone when the fire burns out. On the way to another town. To see another city in another light.

I slipped in and she slipped off her dress. She stepped cautiously. Into that shining stream. Arianne. Theres a place that I can go. Where her memory still flows. It cuts a deeper path. With every season past. Arianne. I can see her as she sleeps. A face as still as that river is deep. Leaves are turning round. White arms, hair of brown. Arianne. Theres a place that I can go. Where her memory still flows. It cuts a deeper path. With every season past. Arianne"
ashes to ashes,"chorus. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. A long time ago before the ice and the snow. There were giants that walked this land. And with each step they took, the mighty mountains shook. And the trees took a knee and the seas rolled in. Then one day they say the sky gave way. And death rained down, it made a terrible sound. There was fire everywhere and nothin' was spared. That walked on the land or flew through the air. And when it all was over. The slate wiped clean with a touch. There God stood and he saw it was good. And He said"

So if you wind up down there . ."

The best rations in the army and a rifle we could keep. When I first laid eyes on the general I knew he was a fightin' man. He was every inch a soldier every word was his command. Well his eyes were cold as the lead and steel forged into tools of war. He took the lives of many and the souls of many more. Well they marched us to Missouri and we hardly stopped for rest. Then he made this speech and said we're comin' to the test. Well we've got to take Saint Louie boys before the yankees do. If we control the Mississippi then the Federals are through. Well they told us that our enemy would all be dressed in blue. They forgot about the winter's cold and the cursed fever too. My brother died at Wilson's creek and Lord I seen him fall. We fell back to the Boston Mountains in the North of Arkansas. CHORUS. Goddamn you Ben McCulloch. I hate you more than any other man alive. And when you die you'll be a foot soldier just like me. In the devil's infantry. And on the way to Fayetteville we cursed McCulloch`s name. And mourned the dead that we'd left behind and we was carrying the lame. I killed a boy the other night who'd never even shaved. I don't even know what I'm fightin' for I ain't never owned a slave. So I snuck out of camp and then I heard the news next night. The Yankees won the battle and McCulloch lost his life
billy and bonnie,"Billy was 17 and mean as hell. Bonnie said she was 30, it was hard to tell. Billy met Bonnie on a Saturday night. At the dirt track races, it was love at first sight. Bonnie was wilder than the west wind blows. Taught Billy every single thing he knows. But she never told billy what she left out. The part about the trouble when your times runs out. When the thrill is gone, when your deal goes south. It's all over when your time runs out. Bonnie said, "";Billy, don't you think it's time. We moved on a little further down the line"";. So they knocked off a Texaco south of town. Blew down the highway with the ragtop down. Billy woke Bonnie up about first light. Said, "";You drive honey, I've been up all night"";. Now Billy wasn't sweatin' no APB. Cause they didn't leave a single soul alive to see. The boy was just 16, made his mama proud. That don't mean nothin' when your time runs out. Bonnie kept pushin' that Cadillac. Billy passed out with the seat reared back. Slept through Louisiana, then just past dark. Bonnie pulled over in a roadside park. Left Billy sleeping and she called the cops. He never knew nothin' when the dime was dropped. Bonnie knew what she had to do. She called the sheriff and she cried on cue. And the state police rousted Billy out. He was dreaming about Bonnie when his time ran out. The sheriff told Billy, "";Boy, you're bound to die. Cause this young lady's gonna testify. That you done took her off against her will. And she told us about the robbery and the boy you killed"";. The judge said, "";Billy, what you got to say. Before I have the sheriff carry you away"";. Billy looked Bonnie right in the in the eye. But he didnt even have to ask her why. But he turned around as they led him out. He said, ""ill see you down in hell when your time runs out"""

christmas in washington,"It's Christmastime in Washington. The Democrats rehearsed. Gettin' into gear for four more years. Things not gettin' worse. The Republicans drink whiskey neat. And thanked their lucky stars. They said, 'He cannot seek another term. They'll be no more FDRs'. I sat home in Tennessee. Staring at the screen. With an uneasy feeling in my chest. And I'm wonderin' what it means. Chorus:. So come back Woody Guthrie. Come back to us now. Tear your eyes from paradise. And rise again somehow. If you run into Jesus. Maybe he can help you out. Come back Woody Guthrie to us now. I followed in your footsteps once. Back in my travelin' days. Somewhere I failed to find your trail. Now I'm stumblin' through the haze. But there's killers on the highway now. And a man can't get around. So I sold my soul for wheels that roll. Now I'm stuck here in this town. Chorus. There's foxes in the hen house. Cows out in the corn. The unions have been busted. Their proud red banners torn. To listen to the radio. You'd think that all was well. But you and me and Cisco know. It's going straight to hell. So come back, Emma Goldman. Rise up, old Joe Hill. The barracades are goin' up. They cannot break our will. Come back to us, Malcolm X. And Martin Luther King. We're marching into Selma. As the bells of freedom ring. Chorus."

don't take your guns to town,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm. A boy filled with wanderlust, who really meant no harm.. He changed his clothes and shined his boots,.

Son, leave your guns at home.. Bill, don't take your guns to town."". He drank his first strong liquor then, to calm his shaking hand.. And tried to tell himself at last he had become a man..

Take me back where I came from. And let me return what I took from the ground. When this body won't carry me no further. Take me back. And lay me down. This east Texas red dirt. Won't grow much of nothin' they say. 'Cept tomatoes and peaches. They mostly drill for oil nowadays. And a hired hand named Regan. First made me understand. And he told me the red was the blood of my kin in the land. chorus
ellis unit one,"I was fresh out of the service. It was back in ‘82. I raised some Cain when I come back to town. I left to be all I could be. Come home without a clue. Now, I married Dawn and had to settle down. So I hired on at the prison. Guess I always knew I would. Just like my dad and both my uncles done. And I worked on every cell block. Now, things're goin' good. But then they transferred me to Ellis Unit One. Swing low. Swing low. Swing low and carry me home. Well, my daddy used to talk about them long nights at the walls. And how they used to strap ‘em in the chair. The kids down from the college and they'd bring their beer ‘n all. ‘N when the lights went out, a cheer rose in the air. Well, folks just got too civilized. Sparky's gatherin' dust. ‘Cause no one wants to touch a smokin' gun. And since they got the injection. They don't mind as much, I guess. They just put ‘em down at Ellis Unit One. Swing low. Swing low. Swing low and carry me home. Well, I've seen ‘em fight like lions, boys. I've seen 'em go like lambs. And I've helped to drag ‘em when they could not stand. And I've heard their mamas cryin' when they heard that big door slam. And I've seen the victim's family holdin' hands. Last night I dreamed that I woke up with straps across my chest. And something cold and black pullin' through my lungs. ‘N even Jesus couldn't save me though I know he did his best. But he don't live on Ellis Unit One. Swing low. Swing low. Swing low and carry me home. Swing low. Don't let go. Swing low and carry me home."
esmeralda's hollywood,"Nights fall hard on Hollywood. The stars don't come out like they should. Up above the world so high tonight. They can't outshine the neon lights. Now the golden days are gone for good. In Esmeralda's Hollywood. She comes out when the sun is gone. But she don't have to walk alone. Cause once the darkness takes this town. She ain't the only ghost around. Waitin' by the public phone. If it don't ring she heads back home. Esmeralda, Esmeralda girl, what are you waitin' for. Esmeralda, Esmeralda, can't hang around this place no more. Searchlights rip the L.A. sky. When you look in Esmeralda's eyes. The people come from miles around. To see the kings and queens they crowned. Behind the barricades they stood. In Esmeralda's Hollywood. Aw, wait until the sun goes down. Listen for the lonely sound. Esmeralda's hanging round. No one shed a tear that day. When Esmeralda passed away. All up and down the strip they say. It was just like any other day. The evil struggled with the good. Down in Esmeralda's Hollywood"
even when i'm blue,I've always heard that love is blind. But I know that there's another kind. Shines like a beacon in the night. And holds up in the morning light. Cause in mv dreams she travels with me when I run. And in my dreams she takes my hand. When I make my stand but morning always comes. And I know it's too good to be true. She loves me even when I'm blue. No one can say that I ain't tried. I keep on searching far and wide. And I know she's out there somewhere now. I'm gonna track her down somehow

f the cc,"I used to listen to the radio. And I don’t guess they’re listenin’ to me no more. They talk too much but that’s okay. I don’t understand a single word they say. Piss and moan about the immigrants. But don’t say nothin’ about the president. A democracy don’t work that way. I can say anything I wanna say. So fuck the FCC. Fuck the FBI. Fuck the CIA. Livin’ in the motherfuckin’ USA. People tell me that I’m paranoid. And I admit I’m gettin’ pretty nervous, boy. It just gets tougher everyday. To sit around and watch it while it slips away. Been called a traitor and a patriot. Call me anything you want to but. Just don’t forget your history. Dirty Lenny died so we could all be free"
fearless heart,Don't you worry bout what you've been told. Cause honey I ain't even close to cold. It's kinda soon to fall in love again. But sometimes the best that you can do is just jump back in. I got me a fearless heart. Strong enough to get you through the scary part. It's been broken many times before. A fearless heart just comes back for more. Folks'll tell you that I'm just no good. But I wouldn't hurt you honey if I could. I can't promise this'll work out right. But it would kill me darlin' if we didn't even try. I admit I fall in love a lot. But I nearly always give it my best shot. I know you must think I'm the reckless kind. But I want a lady with a fearless heart just like mine.
feel alright,"I was born my papa's son. A wanderin' eye and a smokin' gun. Now some of you would live through me. Lock me up and throw away the key. Or just find a place to hide away. Hope that I'll just go away. I feel alright – I feel alright tonight. I'll bring you precious contraband. And ancient tales from distant lands. Of conquerors and concubines and. Conjurers from darker times. Betrayal and conspiracy. Sacrilege and heresy. I got every thing you wont or need. Your darkest fear, your fondest dream. I ask you questions, tell you lies. Criticize and sympathize. Be careful what you wish for friend. Because I've been to hell and now I'm back again"

ft. worth blues,"In Ft. Worth all the neon's burnin' bright. Pretty lights red and blue. But they'd shut down all the honky tonks tonight. And say a prayer or two. If they only knew. You used to say the highway was your home. But we both know that ain't true. It's just the only place a man can go. When he don't know where he's travelin' to. But Colorado's always clean and healin'. And Tennessee in Spring is green and cool. It never really was your kind of town. But you went around with the Ft. Worth Blues. Somewhere up beyond the great divide. Where the sky is wide and the clouds are few. A man can see his way clear to the light. Just hold on tight. That's all you gotta do. And they say Texas weather's always changin'. And one thing change'll bring is somethin' new. And Houston really ain't that bad a town. So you hang around with the Ft. Worth Blues. There's a full moon over Galway Bay tonight. Silver light over green and blue. And every place I travel through, I find. Some kinda sign that you've been through. But Amsterdam was always good for grieving. And London never fails to leave me blue. Paris never was my kinda town. So I walked around with the Ft. Worth Blues."

god is god,"I believe in prophecy. Some folks see things not everybody can see. And, once in a while, they pass. The secret along to you and me. And I believe in miracles. Something sacred burning in every bush and tree. We can all learn to sing the songs the angels sing. Yeah, I believe in God, and God ain't me. I've traveled around the world. Stood on mighty mountains and gazed across the wilderness. Never seen a line in the sand or a diamond in the dust. And as our fate unfurls. Every day that passes I'm sure about a little bit less. Even my money keeps telling me it's God I need to trust. And I believe in God, but God ain't us. God, in my little understanding, don't care what name I call. Whether or not I believe doesn't matter at all. I receive the blessings. That every day on earth's another chance to get it right. Let this little light of mine shine and rage against the night. Just another lesson. Maybe someone's watching and wondering what I got. Maybe this is why I'm here on earth, and maybe not. But I believe in God, and God is God"

goodbye,I remember holdin on to you. All them long and lonely nights I put you through. Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry. But I can't remember if we said goodbye. CHORUS. But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico. One place I may never go in my life again. Was I just off somewhere just too high. But I can't remember if we said goodbye. I only miss you here every now and then. Like the soft breeze blowin; up from the Caribbean. Most Novembers I break down and cry. But I can't remember if we said goodbye. CHORUS.

So maybe you could just write me a letter. And I could open it up when I'm stronger. Another ten or twelve years, maybe longer. Guess I just don't feel much like bad news today.

Maybe you'll run into me somewhere, some night. And if you do just keep goin' your way. Goodbye's all we've got left to say"

guitar town,Hey pretty baby are you ready for me. It's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee. I'm just out of Austin bound for San Antone. With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on. There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town. But no local yokel gonna shut me down. 'Cause me and my boys got this rig unwound. And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town. Nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown. And I ain't the kind to just hang around. But I heard someone callin' my name one day. And I followed that voice down the lost highway. Everybody told me you can't get far. On thirty-seven dollars and a jap guitar. Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down. And a rockin' little combo from the Guitar Town. Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault. I love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt. Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop. Stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why I don't stop. Gotta keep rockin' why I still can. I gotta two pack habit and a motel tan. But when my boots hit the boards I'm a brand new man. With my back to the riser I make my stand. And hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight. We're loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight. One of these days I'm gonna settle down. And take you back with me to the Guitar Town.
halo 'round the moon,There's a halo 'round the moon. So I know it ain't to blame. 'Cause I knew what love could do. But I loved her just the same. Then I let her slip away. Now I'm all alone and blue. That's the price I got to pay. There's a halo 'round the moon. There's a ghost that haunts this town. Just ask anyone you see. He drags his chain around. And no spell can set him free. And he looks a lot like me. And if you ask him why he's bound. He'll just say he lost the key. There's a ghost that haunts this town. There's no shelter from the storm. Without the lightnin' and the rain. And love would hold no charm. If it wasn't for the pain. And it's always been that way. No matter what you do. No matter what you say. There's a halo 'round the moon

harlan man,I'm a Harlan Man. Went down in the mine when I was barely grown. It was easy then. Cause I didn't know what I know now. But I'm a family man. And it's the only life that I've ever known. But I'm a Harlan Man. Just as long as my luck and lungs hold out. I'm a mountain man. Born in east Kentucky and here I'll stay. And if it's the good Lord's plan. I'll wake up in the mornin' and find. I'm lookin' at the end. Of another long week and I can draw my pay. Cause I'm a Harlan Man. Never catch me whinin' cause I ain't that kind. I'm a union man. Just like my daddy and all my kin.

have mercy,"He was standin' on the corner. A hundred dollar bill in his hand. Said I could feed a lot of these people with this. But that ain't the business at hand. Ain't but one reason for a white boy to be. Over on this side of town. He gave that money to the man and he. Bought a little mercy for now. Have mercy on me. Have mercy on me. I'm a sinner Lord can't you see. Have mercy on me. Old Joe don't know how it got started. I guess it was the fire in her eyes. He loved his wife and children. And he wasn't into telling all these lies. But she gave herself so freely. In that room at the top of the stairs. He'd go to her in hope he'd find a little mercy there. Tears were made to fall. Hearts made to break. Sometimes it feels. Like they just want to know. How much you can take. She was all alone that evening. What was she thinking about. Her mind was made up and. I guess it was the only way out. There's a pistol in a pawn shop window. Made of cold, blue steel. She took it home to find out. How warm a little mercy could feel. God knows that mercy ain't free. Have mercy on me"

high fashion queen,"Theres a place everyone of us can go to. Maybe you have been there once or twice. Where all your friends just look at you and whisper. And they want to give you nothing but advice. When you walk in they all know what youre after. And the higher that you get the more theyll see. In a dark room filled with music, wine, and laughter. Your eyes keep searching for her constantly. Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears. Or is she the one whos having fun drinking too much beer. Every night its the same sad old procedure. The doorman winks at you on your way out. cause deep inside he knows just what youre after. And hes got something you cant live without. Theres nothing new that can be said about dirt. And theres nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt. Of an old loves fancy life that left you stranded in a dream.

home to houston,When I pulled out of Basra they all wished me luck. Just like they always did before. With a bulletproof screen on the hood of my truck. And a Bradley on my back door. And I wound her up and shifted her down. And I offered this prayer to my lord. I said “God get me back home to Houston alive. and I won’t drive a truck anymore”. Early in the mornin’ and I’m rollin’ fast. Haulin’ nine thousand gallons of high test gas. Sergeant on the radio hollerin’ at me. Look out up ahead here come a R.P.G.. If I ever get home to Houston alive. Then I won’t drive a truck anymore. I’ve driven the big rigs for all of my life. And my radio handle’s “Train”. Down steep mountain roads on the darkest of nights. I had ice water in my veins. And I come over here ‘cause I just didn’t care. Now I’m older and wiser by far. If I ever get home to Houston alive. Then I won’t drive a truck anymore. Great God A’mighty what was wrong with me. I know the money’s good but buddy can’t you see. You can’t take it with you and that ain’t no lie. I don’t wanna let ‘em get me I’m too young to die. If I ever get home to Houston alive. Then I won’t drive a truck anymore
hometown blues,I wish I'd never come back home. It don't feel right since I've been grown. I can't find any of my old friends hangin' 'round. Won't nothin' bring you down like your hometown. I spent some time in New Orleans. I had to live on rice and beans. I hitched through Texas when the sun was beatin' down. Won't nothin' bring you down like your hometown. CHORUS. Home is where the heart is. Ain't that what they always say. My heart lies in broken pieces. Scattered along the way. So don't think about me when I'm gone. I don't mind travelin' alone. You are the sweetest little thing I ever found. Won't nothin' bring you down like your hometown.
hopeless romantics,You can love most of the people. Most of the time. Now and again if you're lookin' I'm sure. You will find. Someone who's helplessly hoping. That someday. They'll finally find the one. Hopeless romantics keep hoping that. Someday will come. Used to be you could be sure that a. Warrior was true. Nowadays everyone knows that it's cool to be blue. Constantly circling close to the flame And then stopping on a dime. Hopeless romantics will go down in flames every time. Hopeless romantics drop everything and run. When they find a broken heart. Always afraid that they're missing someone. With time on their hands and a missing part. So one of these nights when you're. Sitting at home all alone. And you've finally admitted you're lonely. Right down to the bone. You might as well get on out in it. 'Cause you've got everything to lose. And hopeless romantics are always. At home with the blues. And a broken heart. Find the missing part. Hopeless romantics are usually. Hopelessly true.
"hurtin' me, hurtin' you","Here I am, out in the rain. I know I can't ever wash out the pain. I never meant to be cruel or untrue. I'm just hurtin' me when I'm hurtin' you. Girl I won't say, I'm hurtin' more. I know that you've heard all that before. So go on believe what you wanna believe. But I'm hurtin' you then I'm hurtin' me. I know it's hard to keep hanging on. You think that I hold all of the cards; I know you're wrong. And girl just like me, you ain't got a clue. I'm just hurtin' me when I'm hurtin' you. You know I love you baby. God only knows that I do. I know I've been bad baby. I never, ever meant to be bad to you. I never meant to be cruel or untrue. I'm just hurtin' me when I'm hurtin' you"
i ain't ever satisfied,"I was born by the railroad tracks. Well the train whistle wailed and I wailed right back. Well papa left mama when I was quite young. He said now ""One of these days you're gonna follow me son"". Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. I ain't ever satisfied. Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. I ain't ever satisfied. Now I had me a woman she was my world. But I ran off with my back street girl. Now my back street woman could not be true. She left me standin' on the boulevard thinkin' bout you. I got an empty feeling deep inside. I'm going over to the other side. Last night I dreamed I made it to the promise land. I was standin' at the gate and I had the key in my hand. Saint Peter said ""Come on in boy, you're finally home"". I said ""No thanks Pete, I'll just be moving along""."
i am a wanderer,"I am a wanderer, feet on the ground. Heart on my sleeve and my head in the clouds. I own the star above some distant shore. Wandering ever more. I am a refugee torn from my land. Cast off to travel this world to its end. Never to see my proud mountains again. But I still remember them. I am a labourer, sign round my neck. ""Will work for dignity, trust and respect"". Stand on this corner so you don't forget. I haven't had mine yet. I am a prisoner pacing my cell. Three steps and back, my corner of hell. Lock me away and you swallow the key. But some day I shall be free. And I'll be a wanderer, feet on the ground. Heart on my sleeve and my head in the clouds. I own the star above some distant shore. Wandering ever more"
i can wait,In the blink of an eye. Stars'll fall from the sky. No one even notices. If you think it'll help. I can walk out myself. And we won't have to go through this. If I pretend to hold you tight. And out on the highway late some night. That's all right. If that's all that it takes. Even if my heart breaks. Darlin' I can wait. I have nothin' but time. And this poor heart of mine. Probably could use some rest. When the ghosts are all gone. You can leave your light on. Shinin' through the loneliness. Just like a beacon in the night. Brighter than any star in sight. But that's all right. For as long as it takes. For that mornin' to break. Darlin' I can wait. Out where the mountains meet the sky. Feelin' so lonesome I could cry. But that's all right. 'Cause all the signs say. You'll call me someday. Darlin' I can wait
i don't want to lose you yet,"Baby it's a cold hard world out there. Broken hearted people everywhere. Takin' whatever love they get. I don't wanna wind up like that, so. chorus. Baby throw your arms around my neck. Lay your pretty head against my chest. Listen to one heartbeat then the next. 'Cause baby I don't wanna lose you yet. You know I love you and I know you love me. It's everything that love's supposed to be. But I don't wanna look up one day. And find out we let it slip away. chorus. Can't tell you nothin' 'bout love I guess. That you don't already know. But girl, when you're in my arms like this. I don't ever wanna let you go. Baby maybe I'm wrong but what it I'm right. And everything's depending on us tonight. Maybe we'll pass this way again. But honey I don't wanna wait 'til then, so. chorus"
i feel alright,"I was born my papa's son. A wanderin' eye and a smokin' gun. Now some of you would live through me. Lock me up and throw away the key. Or just find a place to hide away. Hope that I'll just go away. I feel alright – I feel alright tonight. I'll bring you precious contraband. And ancient tales from distant lands. Of conquerors and concubines and. Conjurers from darker times. Betrayal and conspiracy. Sacrilege and heresy. I got every thing you wont or need. Your darkest fear, your fondest dream. I ask you questions, tell you lies. Criticize and sympathize. Be careful what you wish for friend. Because I've been to hell and now I'm back again."
i love you too much,"Ooh pretty baby what you doin' to me. The way your kisses burn right through me. I don't think I can last much longer. I get weaker and my love gets stronger. I don't think that my heart can take it. One little slip of a word might break it. Well believe me baby this ain't no crush. I think maybe I love you too much. Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much. Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much. I tell myself that it ain't no big thing. Then you give another little tug on that heart string. Well you cut me girl and I'm still bleedin'. Well just touch me baby, that's all I'm needin'. You must think that I'm easy, don't ya. But I got scars that I've never shown ya. Well every inch of me burns for your touch. I think maybe I love you too much"
i remember you,"When I'm walkin' these streets. And I'm countin' my steps. And I'm draggin' my feet. 'Cause I ain't ready yet. To start all over again. 'Cause every time that I do. I remember you. Well, you broke my heart. And it healed alright. Now we're far apart. And I don't lie awake at night. But every once in a while. Right out of the blue. I remember you. Well, you never write and I never call. And I don't miss you tonight. I'm just curious, that's all. Do you still have dreams?. Did they all come true?. Does it ever seem like you'll never make it through?. And do you ever miss me the way that I do. When I remember you?. When I'm walkin' these streets. Well, you broke my heart. And I'm countin' my steps. But it healed alright. And I'm draggin' my feet. Now we're far apart. 'Cause I ain't ready yet. Every once in a while. Right out of the blue. I remember you. I remember you"
i still carry you around,"Sweetheart last night I dreamed of you. You loved me like you used to do. Mornin' come and I woke up and found. I still carry you around. Chorus:. I still carry you around. Everywhere I travel now. No matter how I try to put you down. I still carry you around. I still just can't believe you're gone. Your memory haunts me from now on. I walk the streets of this old lonely town. I still carry you around. Chorus. You're with me everywhere I go. In my heart and in my soul. Down every road, no matter where I'm bound. I still carry you around. Chorus"
i thought i was dreaming,"Chorus:. I thought I was dreaming. The moon was hangin in a clear blue sky. You were standin there screaming. And I didnt have a clue as to why. I thought I was dreaming. Cause all I heard you say was goodbye. I thought I was dreaming. I would make up reasons. You were not at home. Your history of demons. Callin on the phone. I check the locks each night. I check em once again. To keep the cold, cruel world outside. And keep you safe within. Repeat chorus. No one has to know. No one has to see. All your childhood secrets. Are safe right here with me. Let me soothe your fever. Let me bring you peace. Let me take you away from all these. Masters of deceit. Bridge:. So far, so far away well go. So far, so far away and where well stop nobody knows. Repeat chorus. I thought I was dreamin. I thought I was dreamin. I thought I was dreamin. A'll I heard you say was good-bye"
i thought you should know,I been watchin’ you watchin’ me. I could feel your eyes from way across the room. But now that I’m holdin’ you close I can see. Ain’t no way I’m gonna get around you. I won’t tell you I don’t need you tonight. I won’t pretend I ain’t burnin’ inside. Your skin glowin’ soft in the silver moonlight. The shadows where the promises hide. The bittersweet taste of your kiss. It’s all more than I can resist. If you’re thinkin’ ‘bout breakin’ my heart. You might as well just pick up your little black dress and go. Somebody else already tore it apart. And I thought you should know. Maybe this is all that you want. Maybe you’re just as lonesome as me. A shoulder that you can cry on. A warm safe place you can be. Someone to call in the middle of the night. When the ghosts in your bedroom won’t rest. Two arms to hold you tight. I promise that I’ll do my best. To give you everything I got to give. And keep your secrets for as long as I live

i'm looking through you,I'm lookin' through you where did you go. I thought I knew you what did I know. You don't look different but you have changed. I'm Iooking through you you're not the same. Your lips are moving I cannot hear. Your voice is soothing but the words aren't clear. You don't sound different I've learned the game. I'm looking through you you're not the same. BRIDGE. Why tell me why did you not treat me right. Love has a nasty habit of disappearing over night. You're thinking of me the same old way. You were above me but not today. the only difference is you're down there. I'm looking through you and you're nowhere
i'm still in love with you,I didn't know. You'd be in this place tonight. Then again I thought you might. Now I don't know what to do. Does it show. When my poor heart skips a beat. Each and every time we meet. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you. There you are. Right across the room from me. Just the way I knew you'd be. Lookin' lonesome wild and blue. I'm alright so far. Just as long as you don't speak. That's what makes my knees go weak. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you. I've done everything I know. To get you off my mind. But sometimes I can't help but hope. That you won't walk away this time. Then I wouldn't have to watch you go. Wouldn't have to miss you so. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you. If I knew what I know now. I'd never let you leave. I'd make it up to you somehow. And darlin' you'd come back to me. Then I wouldn't have to watch you go. Wouldn't have to miss you so. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you. I wouldn't need to be so blue. Wouldn't want you like I do. ‘Cause I'm still in love with you.
if i should fall from grace with god,Chorus:. If I should fall from grace with god. Where no doctor can relieve me. If Im buried neath the sod. But the angels wont receive me. Let me go boys.

jericho road,"I was walkin’. Walkin’ down the Jericho road. And every mile that I traveled showed. And I’m walkin’ down the Jericho road. I just kept on walkin’. Walkin’ down the Jericho road. And the sun set red over fields of gold. And I’m walkin’ down the Jericho road. Well Joshua fit the battle, that’s how the story goes. And the walls come a-tumb-a-lin’ down I know. But I’m still walkin’. Walkin’ down the Jericho road. I met my mother walkin’ down the Jericho road. Tears in her eyes and her head hung low. And she was walkin’ down the Jericho road. I met my father walkin’ down the Jericho road. His back bent over from a heavy load. And he was walkin’down the Jericho road. I said “papa, don’t you know me? Won’t you lay your burden down?”. He just shook his head and told me “son, you better turn around”. And he kept on walkin’. Walkin’ down the Jericho road. I met my brother walkin’ down the Jericho road. And his hands were bloody but his face was clean. And he was walkin’ down the Jericho road. I met my sister walkin’ down the Jericho road. With a babe in her arms that I’d never seen. And she was walkin’ down the Jericho road. She said “it’s just a little orphan child I found along the way. I’ll raise him as my own and he’ll forgive us all someday”. And she kept on walkin’.

jerusalem,"I woke up this mornin' and none of the news was good. And death machines were rumblin' 'cross the ground where Jesus stood. And the man on my TV told me that it had always been that way. And there was nothin' anyone could do or say. And I almost listened to him. Yeah, I almost lost my mind. Then I regained my senses again. And looked into my heart to find. That I believe that one fine day all the children of Abraham. Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem. Well maybe I'm only dreamin' and maybe I'm just a fool. But I don't remember learnin' how to hate in Sunday school. But somewhere along the way I strayed and I never looked back again. But I still find some comfort now and then. Then the storm comes rumblin' in. And I can't lay me down. And the drums are drummin' again. And I can't stand the sound. But I believe there'll come a day when the lion and the lamb. Will lie down in peace together in Jerusalem. And there'll be no barricades then. There'll be no wire or walls. And we can wash all this blood from our hands. And all this hatred from our souls. And I believe that on that day all the children of Abraham. Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem"
john walker's blues,"I'm just an American boy raised on MTV. And I've seen all those kids in the soda pop ads. But none of 'em looked like me. So I started lookin' around for a light out of the dim. And the first thing I heard that made sense was the word. Of Mohammed, peace be upon him. chorus:. A shadu la ilaha illa Allah. There is no God but God. If my daddy could see me now Ã‚Â– chains around my feet. He don't understand that sometimes a man. Has got to fight for what he believes. And I believe God is great, all praise due to him. And if I should die, I'll rise up to the sky. Just like Jesus, peace be upon him. chorus. We came to fight the Jihad and our hearts were pure and strong. As death filled the air, we all offered up prayers. And prepared for our martyrdom. But Allah had some other plan, some secret not revealed. Now they're draggin' me back with my head in a sack. To the land of the infidel. A shadu la ilaha illa Allah. A shadu la ilaha illa Allah"

And the big bikes roared through the Great Northland. When you live on the edge of the law. You know, justice in Ontario. Blue smoke still hung in the air. No one spoke when the cops got there. Well the local constable made the call. Send us Corporal Terry Hall. They all sang a different tune. When Corporal Hall walked in the room. With his picture book and a list of names. One by one the witnesses came. And they told him what he wanted to know. Justice in Ontario. The provincial cops searched far and wide. And the outlaws ran but they could not hide. And they brought em in every single one. Save the man who actually fired the gun. It was down in London, they were tried. And the guilty man stood free outside. When he took the stand to pay his debt. The judge was blind and the jury deaf. In Kingston Town they're locked up still. When the sun goes down and the air is chill. You could swear you heard Jim Donnelly's ghost cry. ""Justice In Ontario"""

You can hang me from a willow tree. You can jail me for eternity. But wont you let my little sister be. Shes afraid of the dark. She prays for the morning light. Shes as free as a bird. And her wings are spread and ready for flight. She knows nothing at all. About you and your emotional plight. But she heard you making noises. In the hallway late last night. If you got to have something to show. And youve got to take it down below. And youre sure that one of us must go. Take me and leave my sister alone
lonelier than this,It doesn't get any lonelier than this. I believe my heart'll break. Tonight I prayed I'd die before I wake. With every breath I'm tastin' your kiss. And it's sweet upon my tongue. Until the bitter tears fall one by one. It doesn't get any lonelier than this. 'Cause I'm on this road alone. My heartbeat ringin' like a hollow drum. I'm about as lonesome as a poor boy gets. And there's nothin' I can do. 'Cause it's dark out here and I can't find you. It doesn't get any lonelier than this. It doesn't get any lonelier than this. I'm as blue as blue can be. Just an empty place where your love should be. I'm sick and tired of walkin' around like this. With my heart outside my skin. Scared to death we'll never touch again. It doesn't get any lonelier than this. And there's no place I can go. Just the dusty corners that the shadows know. Maybe this is as good as it's gonna get. And I'll always be this way. I'll just wander this world callin' out your name. It doesn't get any lonelier than this
"long, lonesome highway blues","Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go. Til I outrun your memory. I can't go home cause I can't face another day alone. Now that you're gone this ain't no place for me. I want to start all over new. But I can't lose these lonesome highway blues. Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go. Til I outrun your memory. Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as fast as I can fly. Just wanna go to someplace you won't be. I'm movin' on to a new place and hold my head up high. Where no one knows what you done to me. A thousand miles between us now. And still some how. These blues'll track me down. Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go. Til I outrun your memory. I'm bound down that long lonesome highway cause it's the only place I know. Where there ain't no clouds hangin' over me. Leave me alone cause it's a long way no matter where I go. Nothin' but blues as far as I can see. I wish I had you back again. But I know I can't. So here I go again. Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go. Til I outrun your memory"
love's to blame,"I was not born in this town. But that ol' highway wore me down. Days roll by and turn to years. I don't know why I'm still here. He told me he loved me so. But there were things he'd never know. Then one day I said I'd stay. But he'd already turned away. I don't know why I gave into to love when it called my name. Now I'm lonely, the highway don't know me, and love's to blame. I swore I'd hit the road again. And I would not recall a thing. But every time I tried to leave. Love came tuggin' at my sleeve. I don't know know why I needed to hear someone call my name. Now I'm lonely, the highway don't know me, and love's to blame. Last night I was fast asleep. Pray the Lord my soul to keep. But I woke up to that highway sound. I knew I'd never leave this town"
lucy dee,"Ive been sittin here talkin at you all night long. Honey, you still come on cool. Well, you could have walked away. Instead youre leading me on. Lucy, whore you tryin to fool?. Chorus:. Yeah, lucy dee. You aint got to run that line on me. Its plain to see. That you aint all that youre made out to be. Well, you can tell all your friends. That youve finally met your equal, lucy dee.

lungs,"Well, wont you lend your lungs to me?. Mine are collapsing. Plant my feet and bitterly breathe. Up the time thats passing.. Breath Ill take and breath Ill give. Pray the day aint poison. Stand among the ones that live. In lonely indecision.. Fingers walk the darkness down. Mind is on the midnight. Gather up the gold youve found. You fool, its only moonlight.. If you try to take it home. Your hands will turn to butter. You better leave this dream alone. Try to find another.. Salvation sat and crossed herself. Called the devil partner. Wisdom burned upon a shelf. Wholl kill the raging cancer. Seal the river at its mouth. Take the water prisoner. Fill the sky with screams and cries. Bathe in fiery answers. Jesus was an only son. And love his only concept. Strangers cry in foreign tongues. And dirty up the doorstep. And I for one, and you for two. Aint got the time for outside. Just keep your injured looks to you. Well tell the world we tried"
me and the eagle,"The eagle looked down on the river below. And he wrapped his wings round him and he fell like a stone. And the big salmon fought but the talons held true. And he shuddered as the world turned from silver to blue. I stood there in awe though I'd seen it before. I was born in these mountains and I'll die here for sure. I've traveled around I've seen city lights. But nothin' that shined like the big sky at night. CHORUS:. Some mornings will find me up above the timberline. Lonesome don't seem like much once you're this high. When it's all said and done I usually find. Me and the eagle are of the same mind. Now when I was young I took me a wife. But she never took to the high country life. So now I'm alone I don't really mind. But her name echoes down from the canyon sometimes. REPEAT CHORUS. In my dreams there's a horse, he stands eighteen hands high. He's as white as the snow and there's fire in his eyes. And he'll bare only me though others have tried. And together we'll travel up across the divide. REPEAT CHORUS"
meet me in the alleyway,"I had a melancholy malady. Went to see the doctor and the doctor say. Too bad, nothin' he could do. He knew a man in louisiana if I'm willin' to pay. Laid my money on the barrelhead. Man behind the bar began to shimmy and shake. Can't lie, I reckoned I was dead. When he picked my money up and I heard him say. Meet me in the alleyway minute to midnight. Don't be late meet me in the alleyway. Better come runnin' the spirits won't wait. Thirteen tiger teeth in my talisman. St. John the conqueror and a black cat bone. Been seen walkin' with the guardians. Now I'm in the alley and I'm all alone. Can't run, can't hide from destiny. Knew this day was callin' nearly all of my life. Been done ain't the only boy from tennessee. To carve his name in cypress with a jawbone knife. So you wanna be the king of america. Say you wanna know the oracle's mind. Say you wanna see the marquesses of mardi gras. Dancin' with the devil at the end of the line"
mercenary song,Me and Bill there we both come from Georgia. Met Hank out in New Mexico. We're bound for Duranqo to join Pancho Villa. We hear that he's payin' in gold. I guess a man's got to do what he's best at. Ain't found nothin' better so far. Been called mercenaries and men with no country. Just soldiers in search of a war. CHORUS. And we're bound for the border. We're soldiers of fortune. And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay. Under the flag of of the greenback dollar. Or the peso down Mexico way. When this war is over might go back to Georgia. And settle down quiet some where. I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile. Heard tell there's some trouble down there
molly-o,"In the shadow of a chestnut tree I hide. Sword and a pistol by my side. Long come a traveler - lay him low. All for the love of my molly-o. I left my family left my home. Out in the wicked world to roam. No road so low I won't go down. For the love of my molly-o. Oh molly. Oh molly. Oh molly. All for the love of my molly-o. I love molly, God only knows. Molly love diamonds, pearls and gold. Bangles, beads and bells I bring. But molly won't wear no wedding ring. Men have died for lesser things. Vengeance, country, God and king. Someday I'll swing from the gallows pole. A final dance for my molly-o"
more than i can do,'m trying hard to let you go. But it's more than I can do. And every day or two. I wind up right back where I started. I'm trying not to let you know. That I'm still in love with you. I can't just sit home blue. 'Cause there ain't no rest for the brokenhearted. Just because you won't unlock your door. That don't mean you don't love me anymore. No matter what you do. Because you know it's more than I can do. You told me that I got to stop. But it's more than I can do. And that ain't nothing new. 'Cause we both know that I'm crazy about you. You said you're gonna call the cops. But I ain't gonna run. Because you're the only one. There ain't no way I could live without you. You left me just when I needed you. So l ain't even close to through with you.
mr. mudd and mr. gold,"Well the wicked king of clubs awoke. And it was to his queen turned. His lips were laughing as they spoke. His eyes like bullets burned. The sun's upon a gambling day. His queen smiled low and blissfully. Let's make some wretched fool to play. Plain it was she did agree. He send his deuce down into diamond. His four to hart, and his trey to spade. Three kings with their legions come. Preparations soon where made. They voted club the days commander. Gave him an army face and number. All but the outlaw jack of diamonds. And the aces in the sky. Well, he gave his sevens first instructions. Spirit me a game of stud. Stakes unscarred by limitation. Between a man named gold and man named mud. Club filled gold with greedy vapors. Till his long, green eyes did glow. And mudd was left with the sighs and trembles. Watching his hard earned money go. Flushes fell on gold like water. Tens they paired and paired again. But the aces only flew through heaven. And the diamond jack called no man friend. Now, the diamond queen saw muds ordeal. Began to think of her long lost son. Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy. And prayed to the angels every one. Now, the diamond queen, she prayed and prayed. And the diamond angel filled muds hole. The wicked king of clubs himself. Fell in face down in front of gold. Now, three kings come to clubs command. But the angels from the sky did ride. Three kings up on the streets of gold. Three fireballs on the muddy side. The club queen heard her husband's call. But lord, that queen of diamond's joy. When the outlaw in the heavenly hall. Turned out to be a wandering boy. Now, mudd he checked and gold bet all. And mudd he raised and gold did call. And the smile just melted on his face. When mudd turned over that diamond ace. Now, here's what this story's told. If you feel like mudd you'll end up gold. If you feel like lost, you'll end up found. So amigo, lay them raises down"

my back pages,"Crimson flames tied through my ears Rollin' high and mighty traps. Pounced with fire on flaming roads. Using ideas as my maps. ""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I. Proud 'neath heated brow. Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth. ""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed. Lies that life is black and white. Spoke from my skull. I dreamed. Romantic facts of musketeers. Foundationed deep, somehow. Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now.. Girls' faces formed the forward path. From phony jealousy To memorizing politics. Of ancient history. Flung down by corpse evangelists. Unthought of, though, somehow. Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. A self-ordained professor's tongue. Too serious to fool. Spouted out that liberty. Is just equality in school. ""Equality,"" I spoke the word. As if a wedding vow. Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand. At the mongrel dogs who teach. Fearing not that I'd become my enemy. In the instant that I preach. My pathway led by confusion boats. Mutiny from stern to bow. Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats. Too noble to neglect. Deceived me into thinking. I had something to protect. Good and bad, I define these terms. Quite clear, no doubt, somehow. Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now"
my old friend the blues,"Just when every ray of hope was gone. I should have known that you would come along. I can't believe I ever doubted you. My old friend the blues. Another lonely night, a nameless town. If sleep don't take me first, you'll come around. 'Cause I know I can always count on you. My old friend the blues. Lovers leave and friends will let you down. But you're the only sure thing that I've found. No matter what I do I'll never lose. My old friend the blues. Just let me hide my weary heart in you. My old friend the blues."
my uncle,A letter came today from my draft board. With trembling hands I read the questionnaire. It asked me lots of things about my mamma and poppa. Now that aint what I call exactly fair. So Im headed for the nearest foreign border. Vancouver may be my kind of town. Cause they dont need the kind of law and order. That tends to keep a good man underground. A sad old soldier once told me a story. About a battlefield that he was on. He said a man should never fight for glory. He must know what is right and what is wrong. So Im headed for the nearest foreign border. Vancouver may be my kind of town. Cause they dont need the kind of law and order. That tends to keep a good man underground. Now I dont know how much I owe my uncle. But I suspect its more than I can pay. Hes asking me to sign a three year contract. I guess Ill catch the first bus out today. So Im headed for the nearest foreign border. Vancouver may be my kind of town. Cause they dont need the kind of law and order. That tends to keep a good man underground

n.y.c.,"He was standing on the highway. Somewhere way out in the sticks. Guitar across his shoulder. Like a 30 ought six. He was staring in my headlights. When I come around the bend. Climbed up on my shotgun side. And told me with a grin. Chorus:. I'm going to New York City. I never really been there. Just like the way it sounds. I heard the girls are pretty. There must be something happening there. It's just too big a town. He was cold and wet and hungry. But he never did complain. Said he'd come a thousand miles. Through sleet and snow and rain. He had a hundred stories. About the places that he'd been. He'd hang around a little while. And hit the road again. Chorus. See I've been to New York City. Seems like it was yesterday. I was standing like a pilgrim. On the Great White Way. The girls were really pretty. But they wouldn't talk to me. I held out about a week. Went back to Tennessee. So, I thought I'd better warn him. As he climbed out of my car. Grabbed his battered suitcase. And shouldered his guitar. I knew I was just jealous. If I didn't wish him well. I slipped the kid a twenty. Said 'Billy give 'em hell'. Chorus x 2."

Theres thirteen hundred and fifty-two guitar cases in nashville. And anyone that unpacks his guitar can play twice as better than I will. Chorus. I was just 13 you might say I was a musical proverbial knee-high. When I heard a couple new sounding tunes on the tube and they blasted me sky high. Then the record man said everyone is a yellow sun record in nashville. And up north there aint nobody buy em and I said, but I will. Chorus. Well theres sixteen thousand eight hundred twenty-one mothers from nashville. All their friends play music and they aint uptight if one of the kids will. Because its custom made for any mothers son to be a guitar picker in nashville. And I sure am glad I got a chance to say a word about the music and the mothers from nashville. Chorus"

nothing but a child,"Once upon a time in a far off land. Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand. Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night. Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light. They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west. Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest. They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles. And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child. Nothing but a child could wash these tears away. Or guide a weary world into the light of day. And nothing but a child could help erase these miles. So once again we all can be children for awhile. Now all around the world, in every iittle town. Everyday is heard a precious little sound. And every mother kind and every father proud. Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed"
now she's gone,"She was her daddy's little darlin'. Her mama's only child. They didn't understand at all when. She took to running wild. She left town one day and never said goodbye. Left a hole in daddy's lap and a tear in mama's eye. Where'd we go wrong and now she's gone. She met a boy up in Kentucky. Charlie was his name. Just when he thought he got lucky. She stole his watch and chain. She always kept on movin' and she never wasted time. And they said she left quite a string of broken hearts behind. Woke up alone and now she's gone. Me, I wasn't even trying. You could say I was content. She went through my life like lightning. Blew out the other end. I still taste her kisses, smell her perfume in the wind. And if I could you know that I would do it all again. She done me wrong, and now she's gone"
nowhere road,"There's a road, in Oklahoma. Straighter than a preacher. Longer than a memory. And it goes, forever onward. Been a good teacher. For a lot of country boys like me. I push that load from here to someday. I'll push as long as I'm alive, but I don't know how long I'll last. 'Cause it's just a road, it ain't no highway. I'm blowin' by the double five. I know I'm going way too fast. I been down this road just searching' for the end. It don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again. Leaves you lonely and cold, standin' on the shoulder. But you've come too far to go back home. So you're walkin' on a nowhere road. Some folks say, if you keep rollin'. And keep it on the yellow line. It'll take you on the big highway. But there's a toll to pay, if you're going. The keeper of the gate is blind. So you better be prepared to pay."
once you love,"A long time ago there lived a man. He had the world in the palm of his hand. Sultans and kings beat a path to his door. He had everything but he still wanted more. One day in spring came a lady so fair. He'd never looked on a beauty so rare. But he didn't trust her so he locked her away. And his gold lost its luster when love died that day. Once you love, once you trust it. Once you give your soul is bare. One false move and you know you're busted. Once you love you care. I knew an old man who lived all alone. In a sad Iittle house at the end of the road. He sat on the front porch in an old rocking chair. And everyone swore he'd gone crazy down there. But no one comes near so how could they know. He lost someone dear to him once long ago. He remembers the laughter and he still tastes the tears. And he still calls her name out after all of these years. You can keep it all inside. You can run but you can't hide. When you think it's safe outside. Look behind you, love will find you"
open up your door,"Here I am sittin' on your porch, dear. Beggin' you darlin', let me in. In total submission I have come here. Oh sweetheart, I know how bad I've been. I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway. I won't spit my tobacco on your floor. I'll come runnin' when you call me. If you just opened up your door. If you tell me you still love me. I won't drink or cuss no more. I won't call your mama ugly. And I won't chase women like before. I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway. I won't spit my tobacco on your floor. I'll come runnin' when you call me. If you just opened up your door. I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway. I won't spit my tobacco on your floor. I'll come runnin' when you call me. If you just opened up your door. If you just opened up your door"
open your window,Just open your window. On a night like tonight. No matter which way the wind blows. Let your heart out to ride. High above all the care and woe. In the world down below. Just open your window. Then youll know where to go. On a big city sidewalk. All alone in a crowd. No one listenin when he talks. To himself right out loud. He was somebodys darlin boy. She held him close when he cried. Just open your window. And let him inside. You may think that youre dreaming. You may think youve gone blind. If your eyes fail to see em. Listen hard and youll find. Theres a song that the angels know. Ringin true every time. If you open your window. Let the music inside

Where no ghost can follow me. There's another place beyond here. Where I'll be free I believe.. Give my radio to Johnson. Thibodeaux can have my fan. Send my Bible home to Mama. Call her every now and then.. I suppose I got it comin'. I can't ever pay enough. All my rippin' and a runnin'. I hurt everyone I loved.. The world'll turn around without me. The sun'll come up in the east. Shinin' down on all of them that hate me. I hope my goin' brings 'em peace.
oxycontin blues,"Well my daddy worked in the coal mine. ‘Till the company shut it down. Then he sat around and drank hisself blind. ‘Till we put him back underground. Now nothin’ grows on this mountain. And what’s a poor boy to do?. Except to wander these hills forgotten. With the oxycontin blues. Well I never cared much for whiskey. ‘Cause it only made daddy mean. Wrapped a little bit tight they tell me. For the methamphetamine. Then my cousin come up from Knoxville. And he taught me a thing or two. Now I’m headed nowhere but downhill. With the oxycontin blues. Got a dollar bill in my pocket. Got a half a tank in my truck. I’m gonna go and pawn grandma’s locket. Hell, maybe it’ll change my luck. Ain’t nothin gonna be right no how. ‘Cause I know I can’t ever lose. This devil that’s draggin’ me down. And the oxycontin blues"
pilgrim,"I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys. This ain't never been my home. Sometimes the road was rocky ‘long the way, boys. But I was never travelin' alone. We'll meet again on some bright highway. Songs to sing and tales to tell. But I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys. Until I see you fare thee well. Ain't no need to cry for me, boys. Somewhere down the road you'll understand. ‘Cause I expect to touch his hand, boys. Put a word in for you if I can."
pocket full of rain,Boys out on the corner. The way they were before. But me I don't go down there. With my money anymore. Yeah I can still remember when. It used to kill the pain. But I woke up every mornin'. With a pocketful of rain. Ain't like it's been easy. I been up and down. And lately I can't seem to keep. My chin up off the ground. But I'd rather eat a pound of dirt than. Taste that taste again. And a world of hurt is better than. A pocket full of rain. Talk about the devil and up he jump. Down beside the levee on a hollow stump. Shakin' like a window girl in amsterdam. I don't wanna be no closer than I am. To tell you he's the devil. 'Cause I know all his names. And I know all his faces well. He's the devil just the same. He'll look you in the eye and lie. And promise anything. Leave you cold and empty as. A pocket full of rain
poison lovers,"I was almost out of here. Nearly left this time. I saw you in my rearview mirror. And I pulled up on a dime. But nothin' ventured, nothin' lost. You can't say we didn't try. That is unless you weigh the cost. Of every tear we cried. Chorus:. Why do we do this to each other. I guess we were always poison lovers. If you could look me in the eye. And tell me what you see. Maybe you can tell me why. I let you torture me. I know that your lips are soft. And they sing the sweetest songs. But I've been listenin' long enough. My heart has turned to stone. Chorus. Another time, another place. Another wind to blame. Cover every track and trace. I'll find you just the same. And even if we made our peace. And went our separate ways. You'd go west and I'd go east. And we'd meet here in this place. Chorus x 2."
poor boy,"I was born on the other side of town. Everybody over there just puts me down. I never thought about it much, til the first time I saw you. Uh-oh, what's a poor boy gonna do. It's bad enough to love you from afar. Me down here and you up where you are. If you hadn't given me that look, that's all it took it's true. U-oh, what's a poor boy gonna do. Baby what's a poor boy got, not a heck of a lot. Just a heart that's true. One thing he sure doesn't need is a heart that bleeds. And these lovesick blues. I know o poor boy can't go far. Baby, maybe someday drive your car. I can look in my rearview, into those eyes of blue. Uh-oh what's a poor boy gonna do"
promise you anything,"No curtains on my window. Outside the sun is sinking low. I feel you letting go. I will promise you anything. Wind whispering in your ear. I'll tell you what you want to hear. If you'll only let me near. I will promise you anything. Well, I don't have to prove my intentions are golden. I don't have to tell you where we're goin'. Feel somethin' wild baby out there blowin'. If you follow me. Run with me if you dare. Hold on I'm gonna take you there. Solemn as a prayer. I will promise you anything. No curtains on my window. Outside the moon is hangin' low. True colors start to show. I will promise you anything"
racing in the street,"I got a sixty-nine chevy with a 396. Fuelie heads and a hurst on the floor. Shes waiting tonight down in the parking lot. Outside the seven-eleven store. Me and my partner sonny built her straight out of scratch. And he rides with me from town to town. We only run for the money got no strings attached. We shut em up and then we shut em down. Tonight tonight the strips just right. I wanna blow em off in my first heat. Summers here and the time is right. Were goin racin in the street. We take all the action we can meet. And we cover all the northeast state. When the strip shuts down we run em in the street. From the fire roads to the interstate. Some guys they just give up living. And start dying little by little piece by piece. Some guys come home from work and wash up. Then go racin in the street. Tonight tonight the strips just right. I wanna blow em all out of their seats. Calling out around the world. Were going racin in the street. I met her on the strip three years ago. In a camaro with this dude from l.a.. I blew that camaro off my back and drove that little girl away. But now theres wrinkles around my babys eyes. And she cries herself to sleep at night. When I come home the house is dark. She sighs ""baby did you make it all right"". She sits on the porch of her daddys house. But all her pretty dreams are torn. She stares off alone into the night. With the eyes of one who hates for just being born. For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels. Rumbling through this promised land. Tonight my baby and me were gonna ride to the sea. And wash these sins off our hands. Tonight tonight the highways bright. Out of our way mister you best keep. cause summers here and the time is right. Were goin racin in the street"
red is the color,"North wind blowin’ like a hurricane house. Old man leanin’ like he’s pullin’ a plow. Neck bowed, bendin’ like a willow bough. Red sky color of the end of time. Bleeds dry runnin’ down the center line. Wise guy pretends he doesn’t see the signs. Bad news everybody talkin’ ‘bout. A short fuse a half an inch from burnin’ out. All used up beyond a reasonable doubt. Make way for his majesty the prodigal king. Still taste the poison when you’re kissin’ the ring. Don’t say he never gave you anything. Deep breath the calm before the storm begins. Cold sweat pretend that you ain’t listenin’. Don’t bet on gettin’ by with that again. Short ride from here to where the beast resides. Fine line that separates the shadows inside. Make mine a double shot of cyanide"
regular guy,"I'm just a regular guy. Never get rich, but I always get by. I got me a wife and a couple a kids. I done pretty much like my daddy did. He always did the best that he could. Took care of mama and us pretty good. He never got rich but he never did try. He was just a regular guy. Well the world goes around. I can't stop it. So I'll sit back and watch the sun go down. If it comes back up then this day's a good un. You know I wouldn't be that surprised. I'm just a regular guy. And I'll work until the day that I die. I'm too young to quit too old to hire. These days a man can't afford to retire. Didn't vote for nobody last time. Cause they wasn't worth a trickle down dime. But one man's promise is another man's lie. And I'm just a regular guy"
rex's blues,"Ride the blue wind high and free. she'll lead you down through misery. leave you low, come time to go. alone and low as low can be. If I had a nickel I'd find a game. If I won a dollar I'd make it rain. If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry. and lay me down dissatisfied. Legs to walk and thoughts to fly. eyes to laugh and lips to cry. a restless tongue to classify. all born to grow and grown to die. So tell my baby I said so long. tell my mother I did no wrong. tell my brother to watch his own. and tell my friends to mourn me none. I'm chained upon the face of time. feelin' full of foolish rhyme. there ain't no dark till something shines. I'm bound to leave this dark behind. Ride the blue wind high and free. she'll lead you down through misery. leave you low, come time to go. alone and low as low can be"
rich man's war,Jimmy joined the army ‘cause he had no place to go. There ain’t nobody hirin’. ‘round here since all the jobs went. down to Mexico. Reckoned that he’d learn himself a trade maybe see the world. Move to the city someday and marry a black haired girl. Somebody somewhere had another plan. Now he’s got a rifle in his hand. Rollin’ into Baghdad wonderin’ how he got this far. Just another poor boy off to fight a rich man’s war. Bobby had an eagle and a flag tattooed on his arm. Red white and blue to the bone when he landed in Kandahar. Left behind a pretty young wife and a baby girl. A stack of overdue bills and went off to save the world. Been a year now and he’s still there. Chasin’ ghosts in the thin dry air. Meanwhile back at home the finance company took his car. Just another poor boy off to fight a rich man’s war. When will we ever learn. When will we ever see. We stand up and take our turn. And keep tellin’ ourselves we’re free. Ali was the second son of a second son. Grew up in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks when the tanks would come. Ain’t nothin’ else to do around here just a game children play. Somethin’ ‘bout livin’ in fear all your life makes you hard that way. He answered when he got the call. Wrapped himself in death and praised Allah. A fat man in a new Mercedes drove him to the door. Just another poor boy off to fight a rich man’s war

But somehow I can't see you up in New York City. I'm gonna leave you alone in your own little world. But won't you be my San Antonio girl. Be my San Antonio girl. Be my, be my, be my, San Antonio girl. Now I know you've heard the stories bout life in the fast lane. What they didn't tell you is you come home on a slow train.

saturday night and sunday morning,"If I was Saturday night. And you were Sunday morning. For a fleeting moment we could touch at midnight. And in that moment, could you really know me?. But I am looking ‘cross the river. Longing to be near. The water is too wide, I can not reach you. I'm as close as I can ever hope to be. And if I was Winter dying. And you the virgin Spring. Gladly to your warmth I would surrender. To melt the snows and set the rivers free. But I am standing on the mountain. Longing to be near. Heaven is too high, I can not reach you. I'm as close as I can ever hope to be. And if you were the water that He turned into wine. And you could satisfy a drunkard's thirst. Well, I'd surely drink until I could not see. But I am lost in the Devil's storm. Longing to be near. The wind, it blows too hard, I can not reach you. I'm as close as I can ever hope to be. And if I was Saturday night. And you were Sunday morning. For a fleeting moment we could touch at midnight. And in that moment, could you really know me?"

So you buy you a ticket to the shadowland. chorus. Down the highway, down the road I'm bound. And my heart keeps poundin' and the wheels go 'round. And it's a hard place for a mortal man. And a heartbroke pilgrim in the shadowland. Yeah, when I was younger I could hold my own. My right hand was thunder and my left was stone. Now I ain't as handsome as I was back then. So I'm takin' my chances in the shadowland. chorus. Been down a thousand highways and they're all the same. Another empty place where I can hide my shame. And there's a heartache waitin' up around the bend. For a lonesome stranger in the shadowland. chorus"

Then I won’t have to swing this thing. One of these day I’m gonna lay this hammer down. One of these nights I’m gonna sing a different tune. All night long beneath the silvery moon. When the war is over. And the union’s strong. Won’t sing no more angry songs. One of these nights I’m gonna sing a different tune. Someday when my struggle’s through. I won’t have to strive. Until then all I can do. Is let my hammer fly. One of these days I’m gonna lay this hammer down. Leave my burden restin’ on the ground. When the air don’t choke ya and the ocean’s clean. And kids don’t die for gasoline. One of these days I’m gonna lay this hammer down. John Henry was a mighty man. Worked his whole life long. When he made that hammer ring. He always sang this song. One of these days I’m gonna lay this hammer down. And I won’t have to drag this weight around. When there ain’t no hunger. And there ain’t no pain. Then I won’t have to swing this thing. One of these day I’m gonna lay this hammer down. Yeah, one of these days I’m gonna lay this hammer down"
steve's last ramble,I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' round. Hangin' up my highway shoes. Lately when I walk they make a hollow sound. And they carry me away from you. Every night I lay my body down. My empty arms just leave me blue. So I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round. And find my way back home to you. I have always been the travelin' kind. A million miles behind me now. I kept on followin' that thin white line. But now I want to turn around. I only lived to hear that highway sound. High and lonesome - low and blue. Now I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round. And find my way back home to you. So say goodbye to all my ramblin' pals. Ol' Highway Dave and Southside Sue. I don't believe they'll miss me anyhow. What's one less wayward soul or two. Down the road they'll pass the jug around. And they'll sing them lonesome highway blues. But me I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round. And find my way back home to you
summer wages,Never hit seventeen. When you play against the dealer. You know that the odds. Wont ride with you. And never leave your woman alone. With your friends around to steal her. Shell be gamled and gone. Like summer wages. And well keep rollin on. til we get to vancouver. And the woman that I love. Shes living there. Its been six long months. And more since Ive seen her. Years have gambled and gone. Like summer wages. Chorus:. In all the beer parlors. All down along main street. The dreams of the seasons. Get all spilled down on the floor. All the big stands of timber. Just waiting for falling. And the hookers standing watchfully. Waiting by the door. So Ill work on the towboats. With my slippery city shoes. Which lord I swore I would never do again. Through the gray fog-bound straits. Where the cedars stand watching. Ill be far off and gone. Like summer wages. Chorus. Never hit seventeen. When you play against the dealer. You know that the odds. Wont ride with you. And never leave your woman alone. With your friends around to steal her. Shell be gamled and gone. Like summer wages. Tag. And the years are gambled and lost. Like summer wages

tecumseh valley,The name she gave was Caroline. The daughter of a miner. And her ways were free and it seemed to me. The sunshine walked beside her. She come from Spencer 'coss the hill. She said her Pa had sent her. 'Cause the coal was low and soon the snow. Would tuwn the skies to winter. Well she said she'd come to look for work. She was not seeking favors. For a dime a day and a place to stay. She'd turn those hands to labor. The times were hard Lord the jobs were few. All through Tecumseh Valley. But she asked around and a job she found. Tending bar for Gypsy Sally. She saved enough to get back home. When spring replaced the winter. But her dreams were denied her Pa had died. The word came down from Spencer. She turned to whorin' out on the streets. With all the lust inside her. It was many a man returned again. To lay himself beside her. Well they found her down beneath the stairs. That led to Gypsy Sally's. In her hand when she died. Was a note that cried. Fare thee well Tecumseh Valley

Ghosts out on the highway, voices on the wind. Tellin’ me that we may never pass this way again. Voices on the highway angels beckonin’. Like a long lost friend. Fare thee well I’m bound to roam.

texas eagle,"My Grandaddy was a railroad man. When I was young he took me by the hand. Dragged me to the station at the break of dawn. Said "";boy I got to show you somethin' 'fore it's gone"";. She was blue and silver - she was right on time. We rode that Texas Eagle on the Mopac line. We had some sandwiches that Granma packed. We rode to Palestine and hitchhiked back. Home in time for supper with a tale to tell. That night I dreamed I heard that lonesome whistle wail. When I got old enough to take the train alone. I rode that Texas Eagle down to San Antone. Nowadays they don't make no trains. Just the piggyback freighters and them Amtrak things. They shut the Eagle down awhile ago. Sold it to the railroad down in Mexico. But every now and then that whistle's on my mind. I ride that Texas Eagle cross the borderline"
the boy who never cried,Long ago and far away. In a land no map can find. There lived in long forgotten days. A boy who never cried. He was his mother's only child. So she never wondered why. Until the news spread far and wide. Of a boy who never cried. From fabled lands the pilgrims came. To behold the silent child. In ancient tones they sang his name. Over every lonely mile. There were those who came in reverence. There were those who stood outside. And whispered low in quatrains dim. Of a boy who never cried. Days grew long and short until. The seasons turned to years. The child grew strong and fairer still. With a face unstained by tears. And every maid and lady fair. Held her breath when he passed by. For their mothers bid them all beware. Of a man who never cries. He lived alone for all his years. And then on the day he died. He shed a single precious tear for a boy who never cried

the devil's right hand,"About the time that daddy left to fight the big war. I saw my first pistol in the general store. In the general store, when i was thirteen. I thought it was the finest thing i ever had seen. So l asked if i could have one someday when i grew up. Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up. She really blew up, and she didn't understand. Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand. The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand. Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand. Me very first pistol was a cap and ball colt. Shoots as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow. It loads a mite slow, and soon i found out. It'll get you into trouble but it can't get you out. So about a year later i bought a colt 45. Called a peacemaker but i never knew why. I never knew why, i didn't understand. Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand. The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand. Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand. Got into a card game in a company town. I caught a miner cheating, i shot the dog down. I shot the dog down, i watched the man fall. He never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw. The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed. Asked me how i pleaded, not guilty i said. Not guilty i said, you've got the wrong man. Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand. The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand. Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand. The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand. Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand"

And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do. 'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue. And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl. 'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl.

Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl"

the gringo's tale,Beggin’ your pardon there stranger. You look like you’re new to this town. We’re a long way away from the beach here. You won’t see many gringos around. Well I come from West Colorado. And I’ve wandered this world far and wide. I’ve lived for some years in the shadows. And my eyes are unused to this light. If you buy me a strong drink of whiskey. I will tell you the tale of my life. It’s long and it’s sad but it fits me. And it may bring a tear to your eye. All the men of my family were solidiers. The hard fightin’ straight talkin’ kind. When my turn came all that was over. But I’d already made up my mind. I was there when we blew though Grenada. And I still have to ask myself why. Then we took down that fool Noriega. That’s where I caught the good colonel’s eye. Well he asked me if I loved my country. And before I had time to reply. He regaled me with tales of past glories. I believed every one of his lies. So I left my old life behind me. Turned my back on my family and friends. And I did everything that they asked me. And I lost some sleep now and again. And I lived like a thief and assassin. I smuggled their poisons sometimes. Until I asked the wrong question in passin’. And the colonel himself dropped the dime. So if you’re ever in west Colorado. Tell the folks in Durango goodbye. There’s a price on my head and I can’t go. So I’ll just wait around here ‘til I die
the gulf of mexico,"Come and gather 'round me people. And a tale to you I'll tell. Of my father and his father. In the days before the spill. With an endless sky above 'em. And a restless sea below. And every blessin' flowing from the gulf of mexico. From my granddad with the shrimp boats. From the time that he was grown. And he scrimped and saved and bought himself. A trawler of his own. He was rough and he was ready. And he drank when he was home. And he made his family's living on the gulf of mexico. We were rolling. We were rolling. Past the deep blue water. He was rolling. Well my daddy drove a crew boat. Hauling workers to the rigs. He was sick of mending nets. And couldn't stand the smell of fish. He drew a steady paycheck. 20 Years at texico. When he died they spread his ashes. On the gulf of mexico. We were rolling. We were rolling. Past the deep green water. He was rolling. As for me, I think of nothing. Any grander than the day. That I stepped out on the drillin' floor. To earn a roughneck's pay. Then one night I swear I saw the devil. Crawlin' from the hole. And he spilled the guts. Of hell out in the gulf of mexico. We were rolling. We were rolling. 'Cross the blood red water. We were rolling"
the kind,Tell me a story 'bout a fella with a crazy dream. Everybody tells him that it won't amount to anything. He fires the shot heard around the world. He wins the prize and he gets the girl. That's the kind of story I like – the kind that makes you think. Sing me a song about a cowboy with an achin' heart. Ridin' along the lonesome prairie 'bout to fall apart. Every time those doggies moan. He doesn't feel so all alone. That's the kind of song that I like – the kind that breaks your heart. Paint me a picture of a girl with a secret smile. Lookin' back at ya 'cross the years through ancient eyes. You're standin' there like an open door. 'Cause she's seen it all before. That's the kind of picture I like – the kind that makes you sigh
the mountain,"I was born on this mountain a long time ago. Before they knocked down the timber and strip-mined the coal. When you rose in the mornin' before it was light. To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night. I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home. She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe. Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone. But I'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home. I was young on this mountain but now I am old. And I knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole. Til one night I lay down and woke up to find. That my childhood was over and I went down in the mine. There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep. And God only knows all the secrets it keeps. There's a chill in the air only miners can feel. There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealed"
the other kind,"""I woke up this morning and I took a look around at all that I got. These days I've been lookin' in the mirror and wondering if that's me lookin' back or not. I'm still the apple of my mama's eye. I'm my daddy's worst fears realized. Here of late all this real estate don't seem all that real to me sometimes. I'm back out on that road again. Turn this beast into the wind. There are those that break and bend. I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind. Now my old buddy, what's his name, says, ""Man what the hell are you thinkin' 'bout. Fool, you got two of everything, but you hang your head just like you was down and out"". And I'm damn sure not suffering from a lack of love. There's plenty more where that came from. Ah - but leave it up to me to say something wrong and hurt someone before I'm done. You see it used to be I was really free. I didn't need no gasoline to run. Before you could say Jack Kerouac you'd turn your back and I'd be gone. Yeah nowadays I got me two good wheels and I seek refuge in aluminum and steel. Aw, it takes me out there for just a little while. And the years fall away with every mile. ""."
the other side of town,When I'm sad and blue. And I'm feeling all alone. There's a place that I go to. That no one knows. Where no matter what I do. Won't nobody put me down. That's why I'm going to. The other side of town. Chorus:. On the other side of town. Where the sun don't ever shine. Everybody walks around. With a shadow cross their minds. When that midnight train rolls by. And they hear that lonesome sound. They just hang their heads and cry. On the other side of town. Well it isn't very far. And it's not that hard to find. You just follow all the other lonely souls. Take a walk down lonesome lane. 'Til you see the dead end sign. And your broken heart will tell you where to go. To the other side of town. Where the sun don't ever shine. Everybody walks around. With a shadow cross their minds. When that midnight train rolls by. And they hear that lonesome sound. They just hang their heads and cry. On the other side of town. So if you've find someone. Who won't ever let you down. Hurry home before the sun goes down. No matter what you do. Don't let night fall like a shroud. And catch you on the other side of town. Chorus.
the rain came down,The old man loaded up everything that he owned. On a wagon and headed out west. The old woman fearlessly faced the unknown. 'Cause she figured he knew what was best. And they settled down hard on a government grant. With six mouths to feed and forty acres to plant. And the rain came down. Like an angel come down from above. And the rain came down. It'll wash you away and there ain't never enough. Fall turned to winter another year gone. Over and over again. Some took their lives from their land and moved on. And some stayed on to plow it back in. And the good Lord he giveth and he taketh away. And the restless shall go and the faithful shall stay. Now my grandaddy died in the room he was born in. Twenty-three summers ago. But I could have sworn he was beside me this morning. When the sheriff showed up at my door. So don't you come around here with your auctioneer man. 'Cause you can have the machines but you ain't taking my land
the revolution starts now,"I was walkin’ down the street. In the town where I was born. I was movin’ to a beat. That I’d never felt before. So I opened up my eyes. And I took a look around. I saw it written ‘cross the sky. The revolution starts now. Yeah, the revolution starts now. The revolution starts now. When you rise above your fear. And tear the walls around you down. The revolution starts here. Where you work and where you play. Where you lay your money down. What you do and what you say. The revolution starts now. Yeah the revolution starts now. Yeah the revolution starts now. In your own backyard. In your own hometown. So what you doin’ standin’ around?. Just follow your heart. The revolution starts now. Last night I had a dream. That the world had turned around. And all our hopes had come to be. And the people gathered ‘round. They all brought what they could bring. And nobody went without. And I learned a song to sing. The revolution starts now"
the seeker,"I was eight years old when my granddaddy died. He that showed me the signs I still miss him sometimes. Been a long time ago but his words still ring true. Whatever you do be a seeker. All these years I have wandered and wherever I roamed. I was never alone or forsaken I know. Somewhere way out yonder I know I will find. That a bright beacon shines for a seeker. You can’t always believe your eyes. It’s your heart that sees through all the lies. And the first answer follows the first question asked. The mystery unmasked by the seeker. In a world full of sorrow, hunger and pain. It’s so hard to explain why I’m still travelin’. But there’s a new day tomorrow and maybe I’ll hold. Something brighter than gold to a seeker"
the truth,"In the blue of the evening when the sun is low. There's a shadow that creeps across my cell block floor. And it comes to remind me what I'm in here for. No, I'm not admittin' that I done the crime. I'm only getting down to doin' time. The passin' of day is no concern of mine. There's a guard on the second shift comes on at three. And he's always about a half inch off of me. Like he needs to keep remindin' me that I'm not free. God forgive him 'cuz he doesn't see. He's no less a prisoner 'cuz he holds a key. and God forbid he turn his back on me. For every wall you build around your fear. A thousand darker things are born in here. There fed on contempt for all that you hold dear. The truth is it doesn't matter what you do. 'Til you gaze in that mirror with an eye that's true. And admit that what scares you is the me in you"
the unrepentant,"In the middle of the night. In the middle of a lonely night. Stands alone in the pale moonlight. Screams out in defiance. He's got no one to turn to. You could talk til you turn blue. He'd just turn his back on you. Ain't no compromising. Cause he's totally untamed. No fear of the unnamed. But he'll take the blame. Cause someone's gotta do it. Now he's out on the highway. He's got the key and the right of way. His tank is full and his toll's paid. Hellbound and determined. He run a dangerous payload. When he comes to the crossroads. Ah, man it's all times to explode. You'll just see the sky burnin'. Now he's standin' at hell's door. With a bad attitude and a forty-four. The devil said, "";What's up man. Now what you come here for?"";. He said, "";Man, let's just get to it"";. He said, "";I always heard that you were the bad one. There's a few places I ain't been, a few things I ain't done. You got your pitchfork and I got my gun"";. Someone's gotta do it"

the week of living dangerously,"I got out of work and I headed for the neighborhood beer joint. I sat around and had a beer with the boys like I always do. Well I didn't have nothin' to say anyway there ain't no point. There's just something 'bout a Monday that always makes me blue. Well it was well after dark so I knew my wife and kids were waitin'. And I guess I took a left where I generally take a right. Well I filled her up with gas, checked the oil at the Texaco station. I threw the car seat in the dumpster and headed off into the night. Woo-ohh-ooh-ooh-ooh. There's somethin' 'bout a Monday that always makes me blue. Well I headed south on 35 hell bent for vinyl. I hadn't never had her up past 55 before. Well somethin' 'bout that little red line always looked so final. Buddy you'd be surprised how fast a Chevrolet truck can go. * Now, down in Mexico they've got a little place called Boystown. Where a man's still a man if you know what I'm talkin' about. Well, I walked into the Cadillac bar and I laid my cash down. I said ""there's plenty more where that came from"" and the lights went out. * (this verse is not included on the official lyrics sheet, but is included on the recording). Well I woke up in a county jail 'cross the line in Laredo. With a headache and a deputy staring at me through the door. Well he said ""Now how you got across that river alive, I don't know. But your wife just made your bail so now you're really dead for sure"". Now my wife, she called my boss and cried so I got my job back. And the boys down at the plant, they whisper and stare at me. Yea well my wife can find a lot of little jobs to keep me on the right track. Well, but that's a small price to pay for a week of living dangerously. Yeah-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-wee. That's a small price to pay for a week of living dangerously"
the window song,"Look out your window. To the street below. Did you see a shadow. Maybe it was a ghost?. A knock on your front door. Check it out again. It could be an echo. Or something in the wind. Look out your window. And tell me what you see. It aint me. Every empty look below. Every angry word we spoke. Proves weve gone as far. As we can go. Roll down my window. And blow the smoke away. Any way the wind blows. Well, thatll be okay. And every minute gets me. Another mile away. You wont even miss me. Till you pull down your shades. Look out your window. And tell me what you see. It aint me. Every empty look below. Every angry word we spoke. Proves weve gone as far. As we can go"
think it over,"You're here, you're gone. I'm still hangin' on. This game ain't nothin' new. You've changed your mind. So many times. But I'm still in love with you. I'll think it over when you're walkin' out the door. Why'd you go and leave me sad and blue. And if you knew. What I go through. You'd think it over too. I hope someday. I'll find a way. I'll walk right out on you. Til that day comes. I'm still the one. If you should need a fool"
this highway's mine (roadmaster),I'm running down this highway. Don't remember where I slept last night. I just remember halfway through the night. I woke up stiff with fright. I dreamed there was no asphalt. I dreamed there was no gasoline. Felt like a rat caught in some nowhere town. I woke up and screamed. This highway. This highway. This highway. This highway. This highway. This highway's mine. I grew up on the dragstrip. I used to shut em down. I used to take their pinkslips. There's a sucker born in every town. I never showed no mercy. I blew them all away. They stood there and cursed me. As I towed their lives away. I used to run the cocaine. I used to run the weed. These days I'm just running. Tryin' to make this highway bleed. Sometimes the only difference 'tween me and this machine. Is I run on desperation. She runs on gasoline. I'm the Roadmaster. The Asphalt Blaster. Mess with me and I'll shut you down. The bad thing. The highway king and I've come to claim my kingdom now
time has come today,"Time has come today. Young hearts can go that way. Can't put it off another day. I don't care what others say. They say we don't listen anyway. Time has come today. The rules have changed today. I have no place to stay. Thinking about the subway. The love has flown away. My tears have come and gone. Oh my lord, I have to roam. I have no home. I have no home. Now the time has come. No place to run. I might get burned up by the sun. But I had my fun. I've been loved and put aside. I've been crushed by tumbling tide. And my soul has been psychedelicized. Now the time has come. There are things to realize. Time has come today. Time has come today. Time"
tom ames prayer,Everyone in Nacadoches knew Tom Ames would come to some bad end. Well the sheriff had cought him stealin' chickens and such. by the time that he was ten. And one day his daddy took a ten dollar bill. and he tucked it in his hand. He said I can tell you're headed for trouble son. and your momma wouldn't understand. So he took that money and his brothers old bay. and he left without a word of thanks. Fell in with a crowd in some border town. and took to robbin' banks. Outside the law your luck will run out fast. and a few years came and went. 'Till he's trapped in an alley in Abilene. with all but four shells spent. And he realized prayin' was the only thing. that he hadn't ever tried. Well he wasn't sure he knew quite how. but he looked up to the sky. Said you don't owe me nothin' and as far as I know. Lord don't owe nothin' to you. And I ain't askin' for a miracle Lord. just a little bit of luck will do. And you know I ain't never prayed before. but it always seemed to me. If prayin' is the same as beggin' Lord. I don't take no charity. Yeah but right now Lord with my back to the wall. Can't help but recall. How they nearly hung me for stealin' a horse. in Fort Smith Arkansas. Judge Parker said guilty and the gavel came down. just like a cannon shot. And I went away quietly. and I began to file and plot. Well they sent the preacher down to my cell. He said the Lord is your only hope. He's the only friend that you gonna have. When you hit the end of Parker's rope. Well I guess he coulda' kept on preachin' 'till Christmas. but he
transcendental blues,"In the darkest hour of the longest night. If it was in my power I'd step into the light. Candles on the alter, penny in your shoe. Walk upon the water transcendental blues. Happy ever after 'til the day you die. Careful what you ask for, you don't know 'til you try. Hands are in your pockets, starin' at your shoes. Wishin' you could stop it transcendental blues. If I had it my way, everything would change. Out here on this highway the rules are still the same. Back roads never carry you where you want 'em to. They leave you standin' there with them ol' transcendental blues"
until the day i die,Back in the hills when we were only kids. Love shined like a diamond in your eyes. I swore I'd never hurt you - then I did. Now I'm all alone with all my lies. I promised that I'd never be untrue. I'd never make you cry. The only promise that I didn't break. Was to love you until the day I die. I wish I'd never seen those city lights. A sight for a country boy to see. For every one that you see shinin' bright. Another is burnin' out like me. I wouldn't listen though you told me dear. I couldn't see the lie. But all the same I still love you tonight. And I'll love you until the day I die. They built this prison just for fools like me. Who don't know a treasure from a stone. I killed a man now I won't ever see. The green rollin' hills where I was born. No I won't ever see your face again. But if I close my eyes. I can almost hear you call me back to then. And I'll love you until the day I die
valentine's day,I come to you with empty hands. I guess I just forgot again. I only got my love to send. On Valentine's Day. I ain't got a card to sign. Roses have been hard to find. I only hope that you'll be mine. On Valentine's Day. I know that I swore that I wouldn't forget. I wrote it all down: I lost it I guess. There's so much I want to say. But all the words just slip away. The way you love me every day. Is Valentine's Day. If I could I would deliver to you. Diamonds and gold; it's the least I can do. So if you'll take my IOU. I could make it up to you. Until then I hope my heart will do. For Valentine's Day.
waiting on you,"Here comes the night, day brings no light. For wrong or right I'm here waiting on you. Words cut too deep, old ghosts won't sleep. But they'll never keep me from waiting on you. Breathing out, breathing in. Holding out, giving in. Doing with or without. For a lifetime, just a lifetime. I can't let go, I wait for you. Till hell goes cold, I'll wait for you. You're all I know and I wait for you. Breathing out, breathing in. Holding out, giving in. Doing with or without waiting on you. Don't show it all, walk on, walk tall. Behind this wall I'm still waiting on you"
warrior,"This is the best time of the day—the dawn. The final cleansing breath unsullied yet. By acrid fume or death’s cacophony. The rank refuse of unchained ambition. And pray, deny me not but know me now,. Your faithful retainer stands resolute. To serve his liege lord without recompense. Perchance to fall and perish namelessly. No flag-draped bier or muffled drum to set. The cadence for a final dress parade. But it was not always thus—remember?. Once you worshipped me and named me a god. In many tongues and made offering lest. I exact too terrible a tribute. Take heed for I am weary, ancient. And decrepit now and my time grows short. There are no honorable frays to join. Only mean death dealt out in dibs and dabs. Or horror unleashed from across oceans. Assail me not with noble policy. For I care not at all for platitude. And surrender such tedious detail. To greater minds than mine and nimbler tongues. Singular in their purpose and resolve. And presuming to speak for everyman. Oh, for another time, a distant field. And there a mortal warrior’s lonely grave. But duty charges me remain until. The end the last battle of the last war. Until that ‘morrow render unto me. That which is mine my stipend well deserved. The fairest flower of your progeny. Your sons, your daughters your hopes and your dreams. The cruel consequence of your conceit"
way down in the hole,When you walk through the garden. You gotta watch your back. Well I beg your pardon. Walk the straight and narrow track. If you walk with Jesus. He's gonna save your soul. You gotta keep the devil. Way down in the hole. He's got the fire and the fury. At his command. Well you don't have to worry. If you hold on to Jesus’ hand. We'll all be safe from Satan. When the thunder rolls. Just gotta help me keep the devil. Way down in the hole. All the angels sing. ‘Bout Jesus' mighty sword. And they'll shield you with their wings. And keep you close to the Lord. Don't pay heed to temptation. For his hands are so cold. You gotta help me keep the devil. Way down in the hole. Way down in the hole. Way down in the hole. Way down in the hole. Way down in the hole. (In the bottom of a hole)

But for now it sounds like heaven. Chorus. May the wind take your troubles away. May the wind. Take your troubles away
