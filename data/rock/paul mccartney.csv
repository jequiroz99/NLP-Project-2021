Peradventure we might play. Very gay, hip hooray. Any sunny morning. (solo). Miles of miles of English garden. Stretching past the willow tree. Lines of holly, hocks and roses, listen most attentively. As a rule the church bells chime. When it's almost supper time. Nanny bakes, fairy cakes. On a Sunday morning. . daniboy_sa"

Till you've felt it running down your back. So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad. Don't complain, it rains for you. The next time you see L.A. rainclouds. Don't complain it rains for you and me"

on my way to work,On my way to work. I rode a big green bus. I could see everything. From the upper deck. People came and went. Smoking cigarettes. I picked the packets up. When the people left. But all the time I thought of you. How far away the future seemed. How could I so many dreams?. And one of them not come true. On my way to work. I bought a magasine. Inside a pretty girl. Who liked to water-ski. She came from Chichester. To study history. She had removed her clothes. For the likes of me. But all the time I thought of you. How would you know that I was there. How could I soul-search everywhere. Without knowing what to do. On my way to work. As I was clocking in. I could see everything. How it came to be. People come and go. Smoking cigarettes. I pick the packets up. When the people leave. But all the time i think of you. How far away the future seems. How could I have so many dreams. And one of them not come true. On my way to work. But all the time I thought of you. How would you know that I was there. How could I soul search everywhere. Without knowing what to do. On my way to work (x2)
on the way,Well you know I'll always love you. But it would have been a lie. If I said that I could please you. Every moment that I try. Wouldn't want to see you crying. So l hope you don't mind.

Wouldn't want to see you crying. So l hope you don't mind. The things I say. On the way. Well you know I'll always love you. Everything will be alright. If I know you don't mind. The things I say. On the way. Well you know I'll always love you. Everything will be ok. If I know you don't mind. The things I say. On the way
once upon a long ago,Picking up scales and broken chords. Puppy dog tails in the House of Lords. Tell me darling. What can it mean?. Making up moons in a minor key. What have those tunes got to do with me?. Tell me darling. Where have you been?. Once upon a long ago. Children searched for treasure. Nature's plan went hand in hand. With pleasure. Such pleasure.. Blowing balloons on a windy day. Desolate dunes with a lot to say. Tell me darling. What have you seen?. Once upon a long ago. Children searched for treasure. Nature's plan went hand in hand. With pleasure. My pleasure.. Playing guitars on an empty stage. Counting the bars of an iron cage. Tell me darling. What can it mean?. Picking up scales and broken chords. Puppy dog tails in the House of Lords. Help me darling. What does it mean?. Once upon a long ago....

penny lane,"Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs. Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known. And all the people that come and go. Stop and say hello. On the corner is a banker with a motorcar. The little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain.... Very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies. I sit, and meanwhile back. In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass. And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.. He likes to keep his fire engine clean. It's a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. Four of fish and finger pies. In summer, meanwhile back. Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout. A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she's in a play. She is anyway. Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer. We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim. Then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain.... Very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies. I sit, and meanwhile back. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies....

People want peace. People want peace. A simple release from their suffering. People want peace. People want peace. Nothing in life is as sad. As a lonely soul searching for peace. Only to find disappointment is waiting. Behind every door that we open. Every catch we release. Brothers and sisters. I beg you to listen. I know that it isn't too late. For we are the people. The voices of freedom. And we're all perfectly clear that we. Don't want to wait. People want peace. People want peace. A simple release from their suffering. People want peace. People want peace.

Make the day all the switches. Wicked witches fan the flame. Careful what you touch in case you burn. Queenie eye, queenie eye, who's got the ball. I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket. O-u-t spells out. That's out. Without a shadow of a doubt. She could put it in a pout. Hear the people shout. Hear the people shout. Play the game, taking chances. Every dance is much the same. Doesn't matter which event you choose. Never blame the circumstances. With romances seldom came. Never pick a fight you're gonna lose. Queenie eye, queenie eye, who's got the ball. I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket. O-u-t spells out. That's out. Without a shadow of a doubt. She could put it in about. Hear the people shout. Hear the people shout. It's a long way, to the finish. When you've never been before. I was nervous, but I did it. Now I'm going back for more. Hey, yeah, hey yeah yeah. Hey, yeah, hey yeah yeah. Here the people shout. Hey, yeah, hey yeah yeah. Queenie eye, queenie eye, who's got the ball. I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket. O-u-t spells out. That's out. Without a shadow of a doubt. She could put it in a pout.

riding to vanity fair,I bit my tongue. I never talked too much. I tried to be so strong. I did my best. I used the gentle touch. I've done it for so long. You put me down. But I can laugh it off. And act like nothing's wrong. But why pretend. I think I've heard enough. Of your familiar song. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'll try to take my mind off you. And now that you don't need my help. I'll use the time to think about myself. You're not aware. Of what you put me through. But now the feeling's gone. But I don't mind. Do what you have to do. You don't fool anyone. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll take a different point of view. And now that you don't need my help. I'll use the time to think about myself. The definition of friendship. Apparently ought to be. Showing support for the one that you love. And I was open to friendship. But you didn't seem to have any to spare. While you were riding to Vanity Fair. There was a time. When every day was young. The sun would always shine. We sang along. When all the songs were sung. Believing every line. That's the trouble with friendship. For someone to feel it. It has to be real or it wouldn't be right. And I keep hoping for friendship. But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there. While you were riding to Vanity Fair. . daniboy_sa

road,"We came from nowhere. Hiding from a storm. We cling together. To keep each other warm. The road to somewhere. Stretches through the night. We follow blindly. Heading for the light.

tommy's coming home,She was counting out the window of the outbound train. All the poles of the telegraph. And the rock-a-bye rhythm in the song of the rails. Couldn't make the sweeper laugh. Down down down so deep. Down down drowning in his sleep. Tommy's coming home again. And a hawk hovered high above a skinny jackrabbit. Pursued by a hungry fox. And a broker awoke her from a fitful slumber. Then consulted his shares and his stocks. Down down down they go. Down down how he'll never know. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. As he glanced on his paper looking through the veil. He could see she was really upset. As she tucked back the ribbon in a velvet box. As he offered her a cigarette. Down down down she took a drag. Now he's covered in a flag. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. But how could he know that only twelve months later. She would wear her skirt up over her knee. And in the very same carriage she'd be flattened with roses. And forget the tears of bigotry. Down down down they flow. Now now now it just don't matter anymore. Tommy made it home again. When it was almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. Tommy's coming home again. Tommy's coming home again. Tommy's coming home

why so blue,Staring from a cradboard castle down and out. One of life's young students find what its all about. Paper flutters angry taxi drivers shout. From the pages of a paper candles shine. On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine. They suggest a highly recommended wine. Once again the same old line. Why so sad. My fine young friend. Why so blue. Weary carriage horses stand in single file. Someone at a crowded bus stop wears a friendly smile. Touching nerves that no one's heard from in a while. Papers from the same old file. Why so sad. My fine young friend. Why so blue. Sometimes when eyes meet. You know. They have to meet again. Sometimes birds of a feather. Got to fly. Together oh. From a dingy attic window candles shine. On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine. Now they drink the highly recommended wine. Free at last and feeling fine. I'm so glad (I am so glad). My (It's not so bad). fine (It's not the end). young (I am the friend). friend (I am the friend). Glad for you. Well I'm so glad (I'd be so sad).
