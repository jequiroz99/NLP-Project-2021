into your arms,There was a new girl in town. She had it all figured out. And I'll state something rash. She had the most amazing smile. I bet you didn't expect that. But she made me change my ways. With eyes like a sunsets baby. And legs that went on for days. (CHORUS). I'm falling in love. But it's falling apart. I need to find my way back to the start. When we were in love. Things were better than they are. Let me back into. Into your arms. She made her way to the bar. I tried to talk to her but she seemed so far. Outta my league. I had to find a way to get her next to me. (CHORUS). Oh she's slipping away. I always freeze when I'm thinking of words to say. All the things she does. Make it seem like love. Just a game. Then I like the way that we play. (CHORUS)

we all roll along,"I remember every night we spent on weekends. With good friends. We did nothin' but it seems like we did so much. Back then.

Yeah, you're all a part of me. (PRE-CHORUS). (CHORUS). I remember every day that I spent dreaming. Of leaving. This place behind I would run away from thinkin'. Adding up all the days spend wasted. Chasing the girls we hated. Some things, well they never change. Take me back to the sleepless nights. The stupid fights. It never mattered who was wrong or who was right. You're all a part of me.

No, not at all. The World disarms before a flash. And you are not allowed to be anybody else. Control what you can, confront what you can't. And always remember how lucky you are to have yourself. I'm unaware where I'm going. Or if I'm going anywhere at all. But I know I'll take the leap. If it is worth the fall. So as long as the blood keeps flowing. I'll set a sail and swim across.

into your arms,There was a new girl in town. She had it all figured out. And I'll state something rash. She had the most amazing smile. I bet you didn't expect that. But she made me change my ways. With eyes like a sunsets baby. And legs that went on for days. (CHORUS). I'm falling in love. But it's falling apart. I need to find my way back to the start. When we were in love. Things were better than they are. Let me back into. Into your arms. She made her way to the bar. I tried to talk to her but she seemed so far. Outta my league. I had to find a way to get her next to me. (CHORUS). Oh she's slipping away. I always freeze when I'm thinking of words to say. All the things she does. Make it seem like love. Just a game. Then I like the way that we play. (CHORUS)

kennedy curse,Oh this feels like the kennedy curse. Ad everything inside is dead. I'm on the fence about what feels worse. The one leaving or the one in bed. In a dream she's talking dirty to me. Just in a language that I can't speak. Then she kisses my scars. As she cuts out my heart. And places it right on her sleeve. I'm having visions of the way it will end. I can see it all now in my head. You will cast the first stone. My sail will be torn. I'll lose my vessel to a dark sea bed. Will someone just come and take my heart. Get it down in front of moving cars. I feel nothing at all. So won't someone just come and take my heart. And tear it apart. Oh my thoughts they remain perverse. And I know I am the first of my kin. To be born with this curse. So persuade and coerce. Because I'm willing to be born again. Will someone just come and take my heart. Set it down in front of moving cars. I feel nothing at all. So won't someone just come and take my heart. And tear it apart. And tear it apart. And tear it apart. Just tear it apart
kiss and sell,"Another party with the same kids. Another night with the same drinks. I need to find myself a new chick. I need to kiss a set of new lips. She's got to be something new to me. A fresh face someone new to please. So come on, come on girl, just you and me. (CHORUS). This kind of girl makes it rough. Holding our breaths while we touch. She won't kiss and tell. But this isn't how. She got that name it all seems like a game. How she moves so well. I won't call this hell. But if I had to guess. I'd say we've got a mess you could sell. And how am I supposed to think. With her hands all over me. Telling me the right things. Ever so distracting. She's gotta be something new to me. Loose ends but no sight of strings. So come on, come on girl, just you and me. Come on girl, just you and me. (CHORUS). She's makin' it harder. Harder to breathe. I'm gettin' weaker. But still pullin' the strings. The lights are all off. There's no one around. We've both lost our minds. They're nowhere to be found. It's gettin' hot. I'm not saying this is hell. But I swear. This girl's a mess you could sell.

In love again, 'cause it's the season. For us to be together, us to be together again.. And a happy new.... Year..."
miles away,"I took a trip up the west coast. LAX to SFO. Was searching for a temp so low. And a summer high. The Sun swayed and set slow. Made waves with some friends I know. Got lost in the ebb and flow. Of the drifting tide. (And I). I didn't ever want to come down. From that west coast rush and summer high. And easy, peaceful sense of time. (I felt so alive). Now I'm alone when I'm back home. It's cold and old. But in my mind. I, I am. Miles and miles away. Pretty pretty girls on two wheels. Dolores Heights and a laid back feel. We sat and drank for a while until. The city came alive. We were smoking with strangers. We were dancing with the lights on. I was singing to ""The Angels"". See that's my favorite X song. In my mind I'm miles away. When the buzz ain't like it was. Well then it's time for a change. Just a subtle change. A tongue full of only tomorrow's. Will never quench your thirst for today. So what do you say we take a trip miles away. I don't ever want to come down. From this west coast rush and summer high. And easy, peaceful sense of time. (I feel so alive). At the moment any place I go. Is beautiful. Because in my mind. I, I am. Miles and miles away"
misery,"I'll say this once again. You people, you aren't my friends. The devil, he can't come in. Tonight, that's right. Looking for misery. But she found me, lying naked on the floor. I was headed insane. The devil told me his name. But he's not welcome here, anymore. Tell me, what do you see?. What do you see?. When you're looking at me. When you look at me. The social responsibility. It's killing me, inside. Looking for misery. But she found me, lying naked on the floor. Stay away, sweet misery. I was headed insane. The devil told me his name. But he's not welcome there, anymore. Stay away, sweet misery. Stay away, sweet misery. The pressure is building with time. I've made it up in my mind. I've got excuses for all these things that I've tried. In my life. Looking for misery. But she found me, lying naked on the floor. Stay away, sweet misery. I was headed insane. The devil told me his name. But he's not welcome there, anymore. Stay away, sweet misery. You're not welcome anymore. Stay away, sweet misery"

whoever she is,"I thought I had my girl but she ran away. My car got stolen and I'm gonna be late. For work this week. Make that the fourth day straight. But I'm fine with it. I thought I had it all but I gave it away. I quit that old job now I'm doin' okay. Those material things. They can't get in my way. Cause I'm over it. (PRE-CHORUS). But whatever she may be. (CHORUS). She could be money, cars, fear of the dark. Your best friends or just strangers in bars. Whoever she is, whoever she may be. One thing's for sure. You don't have to worry. And this is the part where you find out who you are. And these are the friends. Those who've been there from the start. So to hell with the bad news. Dirt on your new shoes. It rained all of May. Till the month of June. (PRE-CHORUS). (CHORUS). And every day in every way oh she will look the same. And every care you used to have just seems to float away. To hell with your new shit. And whether or not you think you fit in. (CHORUS). She could be rainy days, minimum wage. A book that ends with no last page. Whoever she is, whoever she may be. One thing's for sure. You don't have to worry"
with a little help from my friends,"What would you think if I sang out of tune,. Would you stand up and walk out on me.. Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,. And I'll try not to sing out of key.. Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,. Hm I get high with a little help from my friends,. Hm gonna try with a little help from my friends.. What do I do when my love is away.. (Does it worry you to be alone). How do I feel by the end of the day. (Are you sad because you're on your own). No I get by with a little help from my friends,. Hm I get high with a little help from my friends,. Hm gonna try with a little help from my friends.. Do you need anybody?. I need somebody to love.. Could it be anybody?. I want somebody to love.. Would you believe in a love at first sight,. Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.. What do you see when you turn out the light,. I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.. Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,. Hm I get high with a little help from my friends,. Oh gonna try with a little help from my friends.. Do you need anybody?. I just need someone to love,. Could it be anybody?. I want somebody to love.. Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,. Hm gonna try with a little help from my friends,. Oh I get high with a little help from my friends,. Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,. With a little help from my friends."
you left me,"(CHORUS). Oh you left me with a broken heart. And now I see what I shoulda from the start. Yeah you left me with nothing but a kiss. And now I'm leaving you with these lips. Everything looked fine from here. Everything looked more than clear. But now you are gone and I'm still here. So check it out. I wrote it down. In case you ever left this town. And baby you can't fire me. Cause I quit. Right now. (CHORUS). So now I'm pressin'. But I ain't stressin'. She's got a man. I'm with her best friend. Tried at love but it never stuck. She said she loved me. But I didn't give a .... (CHORUS). And now I'm better 'cause you left me. I just left 'cause you let me. Don't keep calling, just forget me. Don't keep calling. Just forget.
