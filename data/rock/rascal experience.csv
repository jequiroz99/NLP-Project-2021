a long ago,"See what you can do, not what you could too. No way out, no way out. Listen what they say, it's the same old shit. Ignore them all, ignore them all. Feel so tiny in the whole worldwide. You're not so small, you're not so small. Don't martyr yourself, you've got nothing to hide. Don't go to the fall, don't go to the fall. Keep on making your own way. Don't fall in the others trap. Or stay here for all day. I won't bother you with a thread. Or even try. No, I won't. The hunger for acceptance, the lack of friends. Keep on your way, keep on your way. Don't get your head down, you're not dressed as clown. Not what they say, not what they say. You want it today, it keeps away. Be the same you want to become. Ending for one, beginning to outrun. It could be fun, it could be fun. You want it closer, but not that much. It hurts to say, but less than pay. For something already broken. Something that's not okay. No, it is not. No. Be what made you what you were. The one they always wonder for. Even that seem worse than was. A long ago. Be what made you what you were. The one they always wonder for. Even that seem worse than was. A long ago. Be what made you what you were. Soon it'll be a long ago"
beggar inside,"Behind a face who says ""stay"". No kind words were said that day. Maybe a lack of care with the things you? ve thought. Were in hands. Same mistakes repeated like. It was the first committing them. But then you know. That I can't be. All you want. All the time. Everything I gave. Meant less for you. Sweetheart. And now you come straight to me. To get back what you got. You had me wrapped around your fingers. But was way far from your heart. Misunderstanding lack of feeling. Who sends me back to where I start. Were you thinking I'd be giving up?. No, not this time. Don't treat people. Like they're disposable. When you know. What keeps you unsafe is what. You daily try to contain. I was hoping things to change. But change is not in my range. But then you know. That I can't be. All you want. All the time. Everything I gave. Meant less for you. Sweetheart. And now you come straight to me. To get back what you got. You had me wrapped around your fingers. But it was way far from your heart. Misunderstanding lack of feeling. Who sends me back to where I start. Were you thinking I'd be giving up?. Not at this time"
beware the jackal,In the ambush beyond you know. No sure where to find. A little piece of hope. Carried by the tide. I'd like to see where I can find. A piece of mine lost within the wagon. That rolled up into a gulf. Or maybe was lost without no hope. Beware the jackal. That creeps inside your head. Ears of arrow and eyes of snake. The worst kind of nightmare. Streets that seem so empty. Full of no one there. A perfect habitat. To whom is not aware. And then find what's left. Of the fears an phobias that were kept. Within the villain maintained by your conscious. Who's trynna make you daft. If you can go and ask for help. But he always haunts you in your bed. Even running he'll always be. A step ahead. Beware the jackal. That creeps inside your head. Ears of arrow and eyes of snake. The worst kind of nightmare. Beware the jackal
dead & buried,"Is the sun turning away?. Or just the night hasn't set the day. For a new start. And things to make. I see, it's difficult, you don? t understand. What I've been planning for my life and then. You see the time. And it is the same for me (OOh ooh). But you have chosen not to agree (OOh ooh). ""Endless laze"" is what you say. But always feeling in a hurry. The time you? ve got now is dead and buried. So come and feel the wind that's blowing. Behind us, and go. You see the time. And it is the same for me (OOh ooh). But you have chosen not to agree (OOh ooh). You see the time and it is the same for me. For you, for us and you can take for free. But you have chosen not to agree. I hope in time one day you see"
demon of the crop,"Smiles in the face. When there were no worries. To think about. The world was gone. Behind a long road. And streets who left no doubt. Those days would turn. Into stories we couldn't live without. But there is always. One thing that keep us on the way. To keep us safe. And to beware what was unsaid. The night comes by. As we wanted to prove. Our courage to the top. And search a living being. Named as the demon of the crop. ""Killed the lout, it's over"". I guess we didn't expect. To hear such a thing. That would sound so correct. A goofy's jump. Inside a stranger? s pool. Made at it's best. But there is always. One thing that keep us. On the way. To keep us safe. But not this time. We were afraid. The night comes by. As we wanted to prove. Our courage to the top. And search a living being. Named as the demon of the crop. Fated to dare ourselves. And find what should. Not be sought. Within a feeling. That was the moment. To do the unthought. The night comes by. As we wanted to prove. Our courage to the top. And search a living being. Named as the demon of the crop"
different view,"Sitting there watching time pass by. Fulfilled with thoughts but no word comes out. Never thought you'd just throw me down. Simple words to you, but make more than sounds. The sun sets as the rain pour down. As I find myself in the good old times. Ghosts of laughter, and lovely pastimes. And a perfect view of you in my mind. I guess it's fine, you were mine. At least used to. Things changed. But I keep on my pursuit. Seeing things in a different view. Said she was not like before. Made her choices, saw the world and one thing to share. ""Keep strong, do the things and don't be scared"". Should I listen or pretend to care?. Many sorts of tricks and lies. These days beliefs last only a while. The kind who laugh and fake a smile. Taken for a sweet goodbye. I guess it's fine, you were mine. At least used to. Things changed. But I keep on my pursuit. Seeing things in a different view. I guess it's fine, you were mine. At least used to. Things changed. But I keep on my pursuit. Seeing things in a different view"
empty beauty,"And every time you know you do. And every time I'm right, you knew. There's not a single word I say just to say. But they don't mean much as I want from them. It comes it's not a single mistake. It's much more heavy than I could take. And if you could say what you want from me. Then I could think, but empty beauty you mean. There are no jokes or bad comprehension. I want you to stay but that was not the answer. For what is the best for me and you. Don't think I hide or own the truth. In theory it seemed so easy. To be alone and not to feel it. But when love turns into disease. It becomes more than I want for me. But just don't turn into a slave. Of the things you've done and what I made. If for a moment I felt free. It wouldn't satisfy me as much as I need. If you push me down and throw me up. It wouldn't change what's already hurt. And don't say that love is all we need. 'cause time has set it can't succeed. You care for what was safe for you. And now you're so confused to lose. The castle that was there to bring you up. And be the strength for you. You care for what was safe for you. And now you're so afraid to lose. The castle that was there to bring you up. And be the strength for you"
fake interest,Won't you think it isn't fair?. To change opinions and not beware. The same old things. You used to care. A change of moods. Same personality. Trying to keep yourself. Not a variety. Like have a crowd. Inside a single being. Not an easy thing. But was an effort did?. It doesn't mean that you want. When you can't stop thinking of that. You simply lose interest. Before you go and forget. And after a while. Maybe you try to get back. But now everything just turned. A simple picture of the past. There's a tale. Who say you can't. Have anything you want. Except for the moment you do your best. But I am completely sure. That once there before. You did not a single effort. One step closer and she can get. A new sort of feeling. She would never accept. It doesn't mean that you want. When you can't stop thinking of that. You simply lose interest. Before you go and forget. And after a while. Maybe you try to get back. But now everything just turned. A simple picture of the past. It doesn't mean that you want. When you can't stop thinking of that. You simply lose interest. Before you go and forget. And after a while. Maybe you try to get back. But now everything just turned. A simple picture of the past. It doesn't mean that you want. When you can't stop thinking of that. You simply lose interest. Before you go and forget
freedom,There's a girl called Freedom besides me. She's quite drunk but she doesn't mind it. She wants more shots down to lose her mind. 'cause maybe this way there would be no guilt. To the things that she might say. But when it's done. There's no place to escape. And she tries to be hardcore. But she's just a little girl. Who lives in daddy's house. And didn't know the world. And perhaps it looks like. She's addicted to wine. She'll be there doing fine. And she tries to be hardcore. But she's just a little girl. Who lives in daddy's house. And didn't know the world. And she tries to be hardcore. But she's just a little girl. Who lives in daddy's house. And didn't know the world
marauders thoughts,"Besides what they fright. They would not lose one night. Need no invite. To see those faces between the. Light flashes pass me by. There's no one by my side. Lost minded struggles. Beneath what I had in. Mind, he knows, who could be there?. He would not think to spare. A chance to go wrong. With those who didn't. Beware, she came to kill. There's no more victims. Except for you. Every time you want more than a bit. You should have taken before. Not that easy with your feet off the floor. An exchange of glances. That could punch out the door. But none of them meant more. Than marauders thoughts. Before the fire ignite. They did not change words. Unlike to that there was. Such a gabble in the air. Can't you see they both have no eyes. For other thing. Besides each others?. Among those people. They had their private world. That was. Like a knife. Which has as purpose. To be sharpen. To do harm. Every time you want more than a bit. You should have taken before. Not that easy with your feet off the floor. An exchange of glances. That could punch out the door. But none of them meant more. Than marauders thoughts. Even if she wanted. The whole you could have given to her. That was not enough. For whom steals hearts for fun. And when you think. You are in safe, you? re wrong. You're stuck in a trap where there's. No way out, there's only one thing to do. Try to escape"
misplaced,"Behold the anger in those faces. What a pity that was the fate. Up on the clouds, stuck on the ground. Locked inside an upsetting room. Still the same if weren't the fact. It was the line between joy and shame. Come back home. Now you're safe. What was left was no mistake. When there's no sure if you are awake. Run and ask for a merciless pinch. Expect it hurts more than you thought. It would bad things are meant. To take a lot less time. Feel what is worth being felt or. Change all the things you don't care anymore. Hope that it? s the best for what you want for. And make yourself more than a useless part of all. After all seems I'm in safe. Surrounded by fake behavior. Trying, but not so hard. To fill old empty spaces. All that talk and lack of confidence. Who messed this over and let me lost again. Didn't ask much when I said. ""Can I have more time?. I'm getting dizzy in this way"". Let me know what I was supposed to do. Tell me I'm not on my own again. Make me feel like all that harm is gone. And there'll be more than one place that I belong. Feel what is worth being felt or. Change all the things you don't care anymore. Hope that it? s the best for what you want for. And make yourself more than a useless part of all"
once,"Remember when you were the sea I sailed. The harbor where I? d never sail away. The home of my truly grace. The part of us that sound so great. If only when it turn apart you feel it. But life ain't easy and then you just can't heal. And I don't even realize I came. Where good intentions are not the same. When I see where I? m going to. Don't you think it was better when you. Just had to be all around. Then no harm would just throw me down. Now I see how once it was so right. To live with a hope, not a fear in sight. Every word I say. Every word I write. Would make more sense if I were impolite. Like once I did, but only for a while. Trying to live happily and not to think about. Back then to what was mine. Plenty memories and miss my child time. When I see where I? m going to. Don't you think it was better when you. Just had to be all around. Then no harm would just throw me down. Can't you see I? m waiting on queue?. To get back my lost time through. And retrieve things like a first gasp. Lost inside a mind who once flew. Change not who I am"
owns your mind,Once you saw her. The day seemed so great. If only for a while. It was not a mistake. Crowds of people. In the very place. But all of them. Just say the same. And it was trouble. Right before the first time. But viciously. She owns your mind. Spending most of the time. Thinking of decisions. And the reason why. Even with the obstacles. And fake goodbyes. You gave your best for a single smile. And more than anything you have to tell. You could spend a day to explain her spell. She'd never show her side before yours. But could change your mind. Without knowing your thoughts. That's the kind of thing. That makes you scared. But once you care. She'd never let go. From all the things. What you know the most. Is that. She owns your. (OOh ooh). Every time she owns your mind. Like you knew you were already hers. If every smile fill an empty while. It'd turn a humble moment. Into what you'd adore. Spending most of the time. Thinking of decisions. And the reason why. Even with the obstacles. And fake goodbyes. You gave your best for a single smile. And more than anything you have to tell. You could spend a day to explain her spell
staircase,"If I could tell a place I've ever been. That made me feel like I'm home. That place would be close. To the staircase's surface all along. Don't feel free to go wrong. To where you know you're all alone. But who knows, you can come and see the unknown. Should be any doubt of what's the best. When you've seen all the choices and chose. What makes you feel more alive then. Anything you could be doing. Living fated to be grounded. Under words that weren't cited. But don't tell me you couldn't. There are more steps. That can't be set in this staircase rise. Take me to the first place that I thought it could be right. By the staircase's vice against any other fright. Take me to the first place that I thought it could be right. By the staircase's vice against any other fright"
