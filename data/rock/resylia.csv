forgive me,I didn't mean it. Forgive me please. Won't you take my fear away?. Take my fear and settle for me. I know you can do this. Though you've never done it to me. I know you can do this. I know you can. I know you can. I know you can. I didn't mean it. Forgive me please. Won't you take my sight away?. Take my sight and settle for me. One more time. I'll pretend that my faith is alive. When I get out of here. I'll be someone else
just another,They ask me how I stand out. What the hell do you play?. Do you have what it takes to be on top?. Would you handle it. What kind of music do I play?. Which band do I sound like. If I have someone to be inspired by. I just wanna shout. that we are just another in the crowd. How do you feel about being on tv?. To be just a one and not a four?. Signing cds and signing posters. That's all you gotta do. While someone else would write your songs. for you. I just wanna shout. that we are just another in the crowd. I'm trying to see the other side. What if we leave behind. The life that we're used to living. Maybe there's something more. Maybe we just can't listen. What could it be that we've been missing?. I just wanna shout. that we are just another in the crowd
lighthouse,"Walking into the night. The street lamps are far behind me. I didn't see no one today. I'm near by the shore. But cannot see no lighthouse. All blackout, I am afraid. Someday you may cross. I'll wait for you with open arms. And then you'll see it all. All the words I spoke. I'll tell you about the nights. I've spent, so much I hoped. Then you'll fell the warmth so close. I'll tell you all about. Oh I just realized. I'm looking at your goddamn pretty eyes. Listen and hear the ooh. Is there any hope for me?. So much anger I can see. Is there any hope for me?. So much anger I can see. And then you'll see it all. All the words I spoke. I'll tell you about the nights. I've spent, so much I hoped. Then you'll fell the warmth so close. I'll tell you all about. Oh I just realized. I'm looking at your goddamn pretty eyes. Listen and hear the ooh. I can't choose, oh I can't pretend. I don't feel the same. I'll tell you all about. Oh I just realized. I'm looking at your goddamn pretty eyes. Listen and hear the ooh"
look around,You're drowning in your conscious. Not struggling to get out. You create stories in your head. Accusing others of feelings. that are actually within yourself. Can't you hear what I'm trying to tell you?. What really happens inside of me. Maybe if we just talk. Things would be better. You don't have to pretend that doesn't matter. You're stuck in your own world. If you dig too deep you're gonna fall. You're closed in your own mind. And a flash of light you'll never find. How do you talk. about trust when you have no confidence at all. you need to know. that sometimes people want to take care. of their lives. you're putting everyone against you. Stop saying things and talk about it with certainty. You're stuck in your own world. If you dig too deep you're gonna fall. You're closed in your own mind. And a flash of light you'll never find. Look around. Can't you see?. Things are moving on. People are growing strong. And you're there sitting all alone. You're stuck in your own world. If you dig too deep you're gonna fall. You're closed in your own mind. And a flash of light you'll never find
new one,"You tried your best. to tie your hands. So let me try. Untie it again. I can't believe the words you say. I once was found, I blew it away. I was giving more than I could. You can't believe. You can't trust me. I just want you to be free. I tried so hard. just to be safe. I held it strong for a long time. But now you're trying to release me. And I'll try hard to get back to the start. I can die if I can't make it. with my own heart. My life is worth nothing without a life. With you. I found you hiding. something great. Between your hands. A mistake. I felt insecure, I felt no floor. Something that I have always feared. I'm slowly opening that door. You fear too much. You felt it wrong. Open and see. It will be gone. But in my mind there's nothing great. It wasn't before, still the same now. That's just too hard for me to do. And I'll try hard to get back to the start. I can die if I can't make it. with my own heart. My life is worth nothing without a life. With you. And I'll try hard to get back to the start. I can die if I can't make it. with my own heart"
slaves,People playing the drums. Despite all the pain. Free the spirits with music and flames. The red takes control of it all. In the darkness of their skins. Now it's all new. Black and red fill each other. With the fire in your eyes. The dope in your minds. By now the hate can be forgotten. The silent dance of the slaves. Only bit of life. The silent dance of the slaves. By your master so repressed. People playing the drums. Despite all the pain. Free the spirits with music and flames. The red takes control of it all. In the darkness of their skins. Now it's all new. Black and red fill each other. With the fire in your eyes. The dope in your minds. By now the hate can be forgotten. The silent dance of the slaves. Only bit of life. The silent dance of the slaves. By your master so repressed. The sun light starts to show. In their faces you can see the cold. One more day holding on. But time has made them strong
understand,I just hurt myself so. I could realize how it felt in your soul. It felt right. It felt real. And the pain was gone or you just felt some more. How you do and what you think. Are you over now or you could do it again?. And the blood becomes a stain. But I still don't understand it anyway
war,Put a gun in my hand. Explain to me the rules. Give me the power to choose. Put a gun in my hand. Explain to me the rules. Give me the power to choose. Between the life of a person. And the glory of a nation. Fire against the mirror. Break into a thousand pieces. I'm breaking all the walls. Release the fear. that you've kept aside all these years. I'm crashing your beliefs. Feel the rage. that's punching hard on your head. Turn me against my equal. Are you supposed to be my enemy?. By the eyes of the authority. Does this fight really have a reason?. Is all this pain truly worth it?. I'm breaking all the walls. Release the fear. that you've kept aside all these years. I'm crashing your beliefs. Feel the rage. that's punching hard on your head. Are we willing to sacrifice. all the innocence?. How does it feel to suppress the rights. of those we've left behind?. I'm breaking all the walls. Release the fear. that you've kept aside all these years. I'm crashing your beliefs. Feel the rage. that's punching hard on your head
window,"On the ground. Crying loud. I hear a sound and look around. The light in my window made me blind. I got up and walked a few steps. My head was spinning. A second thought came to my mind. Thinking about the chance of ending up wrong. The life I built, the friends I made. Could it be all broken now?. It couldn't be, I threw my mind. I fell looking up to the sky. It felt so unusual, so strong. I saw too many things. Sometimes I ran and so I walked. The views of the city from the sky. The same old and my freedom. My head was spinning. A second thought came to my mind. Thinking about the chance of ending up wrong. The life I built, the friends I made. Could it be all broken now?. It couldn't be, I threw my mind. I fell looking up to the sky. It felt so unusual, so strong. On the ground. Crying loud. I hear a sound and look around. The light in my window made me blind. I got up and walked a few. I fell looking up to the sky. It felt so unusual, so strong. I fell looking up to the sky. It felt so unusual, so alive"
