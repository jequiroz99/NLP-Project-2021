Why did you have to let me drown. Drown. Drown. Lay there floating, body bloating. Skin turning to gray. I built my castle, the dirty rascal. Finally got his way. Waves roll in and clean my sins. Now everything is clear. I'm having fun, under the sun. Wishing you were here. Another sunny day. And I feel like getting in the water. Why did you have to let me go. Such a perfect way. To spend my time and swim out farther. Why did you have to let me drown. 1000 leagues, I live and breathe. Along the ocean floor. Now submersed, I join the cursed. To float here evermore. Another sunny day. And I feel like getting in the water. Why did you have to let me go. Such a perfect way. To spend my time and swim out farther. Why did you have to let me drown"

straight jacket,"I wear a 36 long, white is my color. A little tight in the shoulder. But you know, it still fit me good. I wear a 36 long, white is my color. A little tight in the shoulder. But you know, it still fit me good. Anyone can see we're a perfect match. An innocent boy and a psychopath. A week's worth of dating and you talk about moving in. (I talk about moving too fast). My mom disapproved and my friends would say. To break the girl's heart but I'm too afraid. Her clickbait body was a tractor beam. She was a tesla model s with the ludicrous speed. The sex was good but we always fight. I'd try to leave your sorry ass but end up spending the night. Your sweetness, my weakness, you're mean though ingenious. Nothing can go between us (aye, have you seen us?). I've lost it, you're toxic, I botched this, I'm nauseous. Man, I gotta be. Out of my mind, be going crazy. 'Cause it doesn't faze me. Yeah, the way you treat me so bad. I must be out of my brain. Hallucinating. Girl, well it doesn't faze me. Yeah, the way you treat me so bad. I must be out of my mind. Free at last, I'm free at last. Something I'll never say is: I'm free at last. She ain't around so I can vent and get it off my chest. (So here we go, three, two, one). And you're supercali-pessimistic-expiali-narcissistic. You are mary poppins, you'll be soon be going out of business. Guys, let me witness, you got a honda civic.

Yeah, I mentally had it, now my living room's padded. I'm a sadist, I'm addicted to this heroin. You're tonya harding and I'm your nancy kerrigan. Like lloyd braun, I just wanted serenity. But you had to go testing me, gave me suicide tendencies. Your little games, your little, little games. You tricked me into staying, your playing is getting lame. From touching your sweet things to tracking your calls. Go from smacking your ass to punching holes in the walls. Go from sending me fire news to eyeing up other dudes. From picking a favorite song to playlisting breaking tunes. Started so high, now I can hardly breathe. Go from weak in the knees to be too weak I can't leave. You called it, it's all my fault, this I know. Guess I'm better off dead inside than being alone. I just wanna sleep my life away. I must be out of my mind, be going crazy. 'Cause it doesn't faze me. Yeah, the way you treat me so bad. I must be out of my brain. Hallucinating. Girl, well it doesn't phase me. Yeah, the way you treat me so bad. I must be out of my mind. I must be out of my mind.

the last song,"The light that's in your eyes, like everyone wants it to be. Well can't you see that it must be this way. Who knows who's wrong or right, just as long. as you're here tonight.

And just like my father, always taking my likings away. When nobody's watching us. I missed the last song. I blame myself for just standing there too long. I missed the last song. I blame myself for just standing there too long. Why does it feel like this world is just not for us. Why does it feel like this world's. All they've got for us. Why does it feel like nobody's watching us. I missed her sweet smell, I miss it everyday. I miss my best friend, cheap cigars,. Stupid kids and movie stars. And I missed the last song and I miss you. And this time this one's for us. I missed the last song. I blame myself for just standing there too long. I missed the last song. I blame myself for just standing there too long.

the one,"When you come around I don't really know what to say. My mind is racing with thoughts that I can't erase. Like if we've had a house to call our own.

Or if our tempers got the best of us. I wonder if I could've been a better man. Maybe you'd be with me 'til the end. Cause even though we're set and done. I still wonder if you could've been the one. One, one, one. When you come around you always ask if I'm okay. I tell you that I'm fine yeah just like a guy would say. I know you know somethings wrong. Cause you know me better than anyone.

Maybe you'd be with me 'til the end. Cause even though we're set and done. I still wonder if you could've been the one. One, one, one. When you come around I really don't know what to say. I just really fucking miss you and that will never change. Cause I wonder if we could've made it last. I wonder if we gave it all we had. Or if our tempers got the best of us. I wonder if I could've been a better man. Maybe you'd be with me 'til the end. Cause even though we're set and done. I still wonder if you could've been the one. One, one. Could've been the one, you were the one, one. I still wonder if you could've been the one"
the sun has set on me,"Everything has changed, but I just stay the same. Everyone's moved on, an echo of what remains. All the pretty things they twinkle in the light. It chokes me up but you learn to live inside the darkness. The sun has set on me. The sun has set on me. The silence sets me free. The sun has set on me. Like tears in the rain. And no one noticed. A fear I can't explain. No one cares. If only I could see a smile. Before it fades to black. But the light is gone. I've learned to live inside the darkness. The sun has set on me. The sun has set on me. The silence sets me free. The sun has set on me. The sun has set on me. I wish that I could feel. I think I'd like the pain. But none of this is real. 'cause I don't feel a thing. The sun has set on me. The sun has set on me. The silence sets me free. The sun has set on me. The sun has set on me. The sun has set on me. The sun has set on me.
