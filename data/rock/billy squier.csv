in the dark,"Life isn't easy from the singular side. Down in the hole some emotions are hard to hide. It's your decision it's a chance that you take. It's on your head it's a habit that's hard to break. Do you need a friend would you tell no lies. Would you take me in are you lonely in the dark.... You never listen to the voices inside. They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide. You're never sure if the illusion is real. You pinch yourself but the mem'ries are all you feel. Can you break away from your alibis. Can you make a play will you meet me in the dark.... Don'tcha need me...hey, hey. Don'tcha need me...oh yea. Don'tcha leave me...hey, hey. Don'tcha need me...oh yea. You take no int'rest no opinion's too dear. You make the rounds and you try to be so sincere. You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams. You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene. Can you face the fire when you see me there. Can you feel the fire will you love me in the dark...."
lonely is the night,"Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone. Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own. Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call. You feel the time is right--(say) the writin's on the wall. It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in. Call it what you like--It's time you got to win. Lonely, lonely, lonely--your spirit's sinkin' down. You find you're not the only stranger in this town. Red lights, green lights, stop 'n go jive. Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind. You been stealin' shots from the side. Let your feelin's go for a ride. There's danger out tonight..the man is on the prowl. Get the dynamite...the boys are set to howl. Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call. Are you ready for a fight--do you wanna take it all. Slowdown, showdown--waitin' on line. Showtime, no time for changin' your mind. Streets are ringin', march to the sound. Let your secrets follow you down. Somebody's watchin' you baby--so much you can do. Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too. One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do. One kiss'll show you now baby--it can happen to you. No more sleepin', wastin' our time. Midnight creepin's first on our minds. No more lazin' 'round the tv. You'll go crazy--come out with me."

don't let me go,Over and over--wanderin' through the years. Life is a diamond--love is a trail of tears. Sometimes I want you--sometimes I want to fly. I know when I find you. No one can stop me now--break you. Don't let me go--Don't let me. Watchin' the seasons--can't let you pass me by. Turnin' the pages--why do we have to lie. You are the reason--yours are the final eyes. And when I hold you. No one can touch me now--break-through. Don't let me go--Don't let me. Never wanna say goodbye--never wanna make you cry. Never wanna see you go. Now every time I close my eyes. You're the one who makes me realize. Don't let me go.

i need you,"I rise at the break of day--your smile sets me on my way. I need you. See the light shinin' in your eyes--see the hopes that I realize. For you. I am alone...my odds are long...s'all I can do.... I need you.... Take the road where the eagle flies--man follows where his fortune lies. I leave you. Shadows fall and the day is done--the curtain calls but more than anyone. I need you. When I feel low...my amps they blow...when I feel blue. I need you.... And I forget all my sorrow, I forget all my pain. I relinquish my doubts at the sound of your name. I can feel your desire when I walk through that door. I believe in the power that can even the score. Never knew it could take so long--never knew it could feel so wrong without you. They say a woman knows the reasons why--no man ain't supposed to cry. I need you. When after all...my tears they fall...when I pull through.... I need you...."

(another) 1984,From over the air comes a voice without care. Says we're doin' all right. But day out and day in from what he's been sayin'. We're in for a fight. I glance at myself and the world rushin' by. I can see for myself and the fear comes alive. Shades of termination--we're dyin' to survive. . 1984. Machine is the mind--it will rule by design. So you're never alone. We store information without confirmation. Accept the unknown. I think to myself of the times we have tried. To be true to ourselves and to live with the lie. Avoid the contradictions--just keep yourself alive. . 1984. I can't help it...I can't help it...I can't help it.... Life is your decision--we choose to do or die. Can you live with the reality of 1985. . Polite conversation ain't no consolation. For blanks in your eyes. Amidst the confusion there lives the illusion. That love will survive. But I got a chance with myself if I try. To be sure of myself and myself choose to try. Fight for stimulation and love to stay alive. . 1984.
(i put a) spell on you,Find yourself in the middle of the night. With a stranger in the darkness--somethin' don't seem right. Ask yourself 'whatever does it mean?'. You feel you don't belong here--still you're drawn into the scene. Take yourself to the middle of a dream. In a foreign situation nothin's really what it seems. You're not alone--through the static in your mind. There's a long-distance lover on your night-line. From outa nowhere you meet a man--says 'the time is right'. You never knew him--you can't get to him. But when ya do--you'll see the light. I put a spell on you. I'll look you up--I'll break you down. I put a spell on you. Time goes on--like a soldier in the rain. Now you've been around the world and now you're goin' back again. Tell yourself that there's somethin' more to gain. When you step into the fire you can never be the same. I see you movin'--you can't go home and you don't know why. You look for somethin'--you feel that somethin'. Will pull ya through--now wrong or right. I put a spell on you. I watch you walk--you won't get far. I put a spell on you. It keeps you movin'--what will you do when your time is right. You take that somethin'--I'll give ya somethin'. Don'tcha know--I think you might. I put a spell on you.

all we have to give,"I see the world around me...I feel the joy and pain. I hear the sound of silence...and laughter in the rain. Now some things may control us...but some things we can do. Wherever there's a heart that's beatin' there's a place for me and you. When we give a little...we give all we have to give...give a little. Now we all got our problems...and some you can't ignore. But if we stand together we stand for somethin' more. With all we have to hope for...and all we have to give. Whenever it's your heart that's beatin' there's a chance for us to live. When we give a little...we give all we have to give...give a little. They say the days are gettin' short...and the nights are gettin' longer. The weak are gettin' weaker...and the strong keep gettin' stronger. On a street with no connections...everyone can use protection. They're stirrin' up the lies, they spin 'em round between me and you. They say there's nothin' you or I can ever really hope to do. But every man in every nation can hear the call of soul salvation. A hundred million faces...a hundred billion tears. No one can come between us to isolate our fears. With all we have to hope for...and all we have to give. Whenever it's your heart that's beatin'...there's a chance for us to live. For every day your heart beats...for every day the sun shines. With every breath our hearts meet...with every step our hopes fly. For every day your heart beats...whichever way your soul flies.

Don't say good-bye to the dreams of our love. Don't say good-bye...keep dreamin' for us. A shot in the dark...like ships in the night. So we're both older now...well that's all right. 'Cause visions live on where memories have died. We've walked that road before...we'll get there this time. Now I know you tried. You tell me that you've had enough. You think it might be easier to just give up. Don't say good-bye...don't say it's over. Don't say good-bye to the dreams of our love. Don't say good-bye...lean on my shoulder. Don't say good-bye...keep dreamin' for us. Tell ya baby...I can't stop thinkin'. 'Bout all those times you walked on out my door. Now I don't want you...say I don't need it. But I'll never--no never...let you go. Don't say good-bye...and don't look back. Don't say good-bye to the dreams of our love. Don't look back...and don't say why.

conscience point,Freedom rider...though you've tried. Words are not enough for you now.... It's hard on your pride. I can't find you...though I know you. You are just a step out of line.... Come closer to me. When the lines are drawn. And no one comes to break us down. And the walls that stood between us. Tumble to the ground. It's time to find someone to run to. I've got a place in mind. It's known as conscience point. It's where the clouds roll by. They say that nothin' really matters. I'm goin' out to find. Why people come this way. And put the past behind. You know there really is a reason. Changing faces...trading places. Nothing lasts anymore...it's hard when you try. Star-crossed lovers run for cover. I don't know if it's right...but I know how I feel. When you're tired of all those things. You never said before. And although you've tried you never opened that door. It's time to find someone to run to. We'll run the roads tonite. We'll meet at conscience point. I look into your eyes. You say that nothin' really matters. If I could change your mind. If you would look my way. And leave it all behind. You'd know you really mean so much to me. When you've tired of all those things. You've never done before. And you never took the time. To fall in love before. You've got to find someone to...yea. We'll run the roads tonite. We'll meet at conscience point. I'll look into your eyes. And know that somethin' really matters. 'Cause we can change our minds. And we can find our way. And leave it all behind. 'Cause you really mean that much to me. Conscience point...take a walk with me. And put it all behind. We'll make some history.
don't let me go,Over and over--wanderin' through the years. Life is a diamond--love is a trail of tears. Sometimes I want you--sometimes I want to fly. I know when I find you. No one can stop me now--break you. Don't let me go--Don't let me. Watchin' the seasons--can't let you pass me by. Turnin' the pages--why do we have to lie. You are the reason--yours are the final eyes. And when I hold you. No one can touch me now--break-through. Don't let me go--Don't let me. Never wanna say goodbye--never wanna make you cry. Never wanna see you go. Now every time I close my eyes. You're the one who makes me realize. Don't let me go.
don't say no,"We live in confusion times---my world is a vice. Nobody gets out alive...but you can break through the ice. Don't say no. My wounds are the open kind---I bleed every day. I pray for a change of mind...you could take me away. Don't say no. Take on the system, playin' on the wrong side. Spend all my money tryin' to have a good time. Come 'round to see you from time to time. Week in the knees and I'm busted. Some people they treat me kind...some drive me away. Some people they blow your mind...it's not easy today. Don't say no. I live on the borderline...you come from the void. I beg you to cross the line...you take good care of your boy. Don't say no. Got me a ticket sittin' on a gold mine. Send me the int'rest, take me where the sun shines. Come 'round to see me from time to time. Bring it to me when I'm busted. One minute I'm outa time...I don't fit in your game. You kill me in overtime...I don't remember my name. One minute you're on my mind...next minute you're gone. You tell me to read the signs...they tell me we're on. Don't say no...."
don't say you love me,You can't get up--you can't get down. You can't sit still--you never settle down. Don't say you love me--just say--'huh'!. You love runs hot--your love runs cold. You can't get loose until you get control. Don't say you love me--just say--'huh'!. Don't say you love me--just say--'all right'. You're scared to win--you're scared to lose. You're scared to live with the life you choose. Don't say you love me--just say--. You can't say 'yes'--you can't say 'no'. Your mind's made up--you don't know where to go. Don't say you love me--whatcha say?. Don't say you love me--just say--'huh'!. I can see you comin' round again. I can feel you but I can't say when. I will be there in your now and then.
emotions in motion,Bend your back by the light o' the sun. You come to the business--you're the number one. When twilight comes you're a runner in the night. It turns you on like a hot tail-light. Get down--you really get down--you never let down. Come down--you never come down--you never come down. . Emotions in motion. . Back street boy gonna sell you some sin. He'll wind you up--he gonna suck you in. The blood say yes--the mind say no. The voice in your ear say you go - go - go. Run down--you really run down--you really run down. Cool down--you never cool down--you better cool down. . Emotions in motion. . Give yourself to a life of extremes. You're into the action--it's a part of your dream. Now there're some things you never can tell. But when the door lies open throw your coins in the well. Get down--you really get down--you really get down. Right now--you want it right now--hold tight now. . Emotions in motion. .
everybody wants you,"You see 'em comin' at you every night. Strung on pretension they fall for you at first sight. You know their business--you think it's a bore. They make you restless--it's nothin' you ain't seen before. Get around town, spend your time on the run. You never let down...say you do it for fun. Never miss a play, though you make quite a few. You give it all away when everybody wants you. . You crave attention--you can never say ""no"". Throw your affections anyway the wind blows. You always make it--you're on top of the scene. You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine. Puttin' on the eyes 'til there's nobody else. You never realize what you do to yourself. The things that they see make the daily reviews. You never get free when everybody wants you. . Everybody knows you. Everybody snows you. Everybody needs you...leads you...bleeds you. . Nights of confusion and impossible dreams. Days at the mirror, patchin' up around the seams. You got your glory--you paid for it all. You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol. Say goodbye to conventional ways. You can't escape the hours--you lose track of the days. The more you understand, seems the more like you do. You never get away...everybody wants you."
eye on you,I watch you on the tv--you're with me every place I go. I'm caught up in the daydream--I'm into everyone you know. Turn on the action--grab every minute. Learn every lesson--then live to regret it. I'm so distracted--my mind's disengaged. Sharin' the moments when you're all the rage. . I got my eyes on you. Got my eye on you.... Those overnight conditions always get the best of you. You're fuelin' my suspicions--I'm taken by the sneak preview. You got the numbers--you got no limits. One day you're out but the next day you're in it. You find the answers--you know what to say. Give us our reasons for livin' today. . I got my eyes on you. Got my eye on you.... We share the laughter and pain when you're in it. Bring on disaster--cause we know you'll win it. We're all believers--so watch what you say. Turn on those feelin's...I can't look away. . I got my eyes on you. Got my eye on you.
facts of life,These are the golden years. When people get what they want. And you can be one of them. 'Cause you're old enough to burn. So you earn your star--you run from the pack. Sell the clothes from off of your back. And you'll go far--you'll never look back. Your dreams can never die. Welcome to the facts of life. Life on the edge of town.... No one could get near you. But one day you call to them. When they find you where it hurts. You can fall so far you never come up. All you've got is never enough. And just one word can make it so tough. Your dreams were not so wise.... You're runnin' through the facts of life. Oh you're runnin' from the facts of life. Oh you're runnin' from the facts of life. Oh you're runnin' from the facts of life. Oh you're runnin' from the facts of life. The first time I saw you. You were untouchable. You walked on the poet's heels. No one could deny you. Now you're lookin' for better things. Someone to get close to. A song everybody knows. ...When you find out what it's worth.... And you come so far you'll never turn back. The stones they throw--they roll off your back. They make it hard--you like it like that. Your dreams will never die. When you go so far you'll never turn back. The stones they throw--you throw 'em right back. They play so hard--you like it like that. Our dreams become our lives. No more runnin' from the facts of life. No more runnin' from the facts of life. No more runnin' from the facts of life. No more runnin'.... No more runnin'.... No more runnin' from the facts of life.
fall for love,"You know sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night.... And I get to thinkin' about all the crazy things we do in life just to get by.... And somehow somethin' always seems to escape me.... And I find myself holdin' on to nothin' more than a dream.... And it keeps hauntin' me...over and over and over again.... . In a darkened sky of blue I'm thinkin' of you.... As the pieces come unglued I'm reachin' for you.... Love can change the days in your life. Heartbeats and whispers in the dead of night. The sound of a hand--the touch of an eye. Visions are callin' that you can't deny. . And I fall for love.... So every day I'm out on the streets tryin' to make some sense of it.... You know sometimes it feels so close that I can almost reach out.... But it always slips away.... I keep tellin' myself...""I can't stop tryin'...not ever"".... . 'Til I see that dream come true baby with you.... If it's the final thing I do I'm waitin' for you.... Loneliness and love will collide. The body's breakin' but the spirit's alive. And just when you think it's all been a lie. Visions are callin' and you never can deny. . And I fall for love.... ...I'm gonna keep on tryin'...."
g.o.d.,"I been searchin' for so long. For a love to fill my life--soldier me on. Feel the hunger in my blood. As I walk into the fire I can't get enough. Where, oh where can I find You. I have seen You and called Your name. Walked the streets of my life in vain. Seen the idols with feet of clay. Pull me closer--push me away. Where, oh where can I find You. Where, oh where. Times have taught me to use my time. Journey's end is an endless climb. ...When to follow and when to lead.... When to know just what I need. Where You gone G.O.D.. Have You gone down on me--don'tcha do. I ain't ready for no second-hand love. I'm no stranger to this loneliness. Leave me lonely--leave me lost. Leave me nothin' but myself to carry the cost. Now the only, only reason to come to You again. You gotta fight to win your freedom--lose your chains. Love's illusions ring all too clear. Cross my mind when I hold You near. Know Your pleasure--You leave me cold. Lonely nights with my thoughts untold. Where, oh where can I find You. Where, do Ya care. I don't care what the price may be. 'Down' is right when You're down with me. Can You tell me--am I to blame. Sing my song to Your heart's refrain. Where Ya gone G.O.D.. Have You run out on me-don'tcha do. All You give me is second-hand love. All I wanna do is get on down with You. All I ask for and all I pray. Meet You down on the streets one day. Have You taste life from on Your knees. Hear me callin' ya 'help me, please'."

i need you,"I rise at the break of day--your smile sets me on my way. I need you. See the light shinin' in your eyes--see the hopes that I realize. For you. I am alone...my odds are long...s'all I can do.... I need you.... Take the road where the eagle flies--man follows where his fortune lies. I leave you. Shadows fall and the day is done--the curtain calls but more than anyone. I need you. When I feel low...my amps they blow...when I feel blue. I need you.... And I forget all my sorrow, I forget all my pain. I relinquish my doubts at the sound of your name. I can feel your desire when I walk through that door. I believe in the power that can even the score. Never knew it could take so long--never knew it could feel so wrong without you. They say a woman knows the reasons why--no man ain't supposed to cry. I need you. When after all...my tears they fall...when I pull through.... I need you...."
in the dark,"Life isn't easy from the singular side. Down in the hole some emotions are hard to hide. It's your decision it's a chance that you take.

They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide. You're never sure if the illusion is real. You pinch yourself but the mem'ries are all you feel. Can you break away from your alibis.

it keeps you rockin',"When the lights blow and anything goes and nobody knows. When the sparks fly from in your eye and you don't know why. In a tight squeeze, you're on your knees. You're into the freeze. Then the right sound can bring you 'round. Put your right side down. It keeps you rockin'. On a hot night you feel all right--you're wound up tight. On the next day you over-play--wanna fade away. In a cold rain, your love in vain--make you go insane. Bring you right down and turn you 'round. Gotta hear that sound. It keeps you rockin'. Take this fight, wherever it takes you. Wrong or right, don't let it shake you. Fight the fight, whatever it makes you. That's all right--I know you can break through.

keep me satisfied,Early in the mornin' I'm layin' on my bed. Stickin' to the rhythm of the music in my head. Rockin' in the mirror...rollin' out the door.

It's a tax accountant's nightmare--it's a rock 'n roll dream. The income may be different but the outcome's still the same. You'll never be a winner boy until you play the game. Hounded to distraction...racin' to and fro. Losin' my direction keepin' up my status quo. Now I tried - tried - tried - tried. It just don't seem to keep me satisfied. . A hundred-thousand miles in a 747. Take it all in style if you wanna get to heaven. Chasin' all the action every single night. Never understand it but you try to do it right. Ragged 'round the edges...none the worse for wear. Cuttin' all the corners but they never get me there. Now I try - try - try - try. It just don't seem to keep me satisfied. .

learn how to live,"You got a lot to learn. You play in the fire...you might get burned. You gotta sacrifice. You're playin' the victim of your own device. You try to understand. The comb-in-the-ashes isn't what you planned. You...it gets you every time. You're chasin' the visions--they're nowhere to find. . Learn how to give...learn how to take. Learn how to live before it's too late. . You got the restless eyes. They turn to distraction--there's no compromise. You gotta take some time. And fight for the answers--they're hard to find. You..now don'tcha fantasize. Start makin' your chances materialize. . Learn how to bend...learn how to break. Learn how to mend broken heartaches. Learn to forgive...learn how to wait. Learn how to live before it's too late. . Run from the light, and you lock all your doors. It's harder to fight when you've gone down before. The scene's 're so right--but they play out so wrong. So into the night it goes on and on and on and on and on."
listen to the heartbeat,"Sometimes I wonder...think I just can't stand no more. Can't seem to find myself, or what it is I'm lookin' for. People call out my name. Lately things they don't seem the same. That's when I know...I gotta make the rounds again. Find yourself in the danger-zone. Reachin' out through the under-tones. Chase the spirit you can't control. The inner notions 're takin' hold. . Listen to the heartbeat. I remember those cold cold nights...we'd stay up all night long. I can remember you holdin' out...and I'd be holdin' on. You can put out my fire. You can stir up my one desire. You can make me wonder how we could ever shy away. You bet your life on that rendezvous. Close your eyes and it all comes true. Cast your fortune into the wind. Those inner notions'll pull you in. . Listen to the heartbeat."
lonely is the night,"Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone. Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own. Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call. You feel the time is right--(say) the writin's on the wall. It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in. Call it what you like--It's time you got to win. Lonely, lonely, lonely--your spirit's sinkin' down. You find you're not the only stranger in this town. Red lights, green lights, stop 'n go jive. Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind. You been stealin' shots from the side. Let your feelin's go for a ride. There's danger out tonight..the man is on the prowl. Get the dynamite...the boys are set to howl. Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call. Are you ready for a fight--do you wanna take it all. Slowdown, showdown--waitin' on line. Showtime, no time for changin' your mind. Streets are ringin', march to the sound. Let your secrets follow you down. Somebody's watchin' you baby--so much you can do. Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too. One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do. One kiss'll show you now baby--it can happen to you. No more sleepin', wastin' our time. Midnight creepin's first on our minds. No more lazin' 'round the tv. You'll go crazy--come out with me."
lonely one,"Light in the window but out in the night it's a cold world. Locked on collision--wrong over right between boy and girl. Call it the fashion--but can you deny your vices are one up on you.

Split screens and sidewalks...six strings and nighthawks and someone new. You got your answers and you got some time...but sometimes they run out on you. You got your reasons and you got your lies...but sometimes they leave you. Lonely, so lonely...lonely so lie. When you're the only one...you feel the lonely one. Now you're the only one...you see the lonely one. You try to be certain...you're certain to try. Chasin' your shadows...changin' your mind. Facin' those faces again and again and again.... Turn from the window and walk through the shadows of love gone by. Searchin' your manner way down inside, still you don't know why. Lost in the mirror you're hopin' to find the fountain that's run out on you. You got your rhythm and you got your lines, but sometimes they leave you. Lonely so lonely...lonely so lie. When you're the only one...you feel the lonely one. Now you're the only one...you see the lonely one. And you go on and on and on. You see the lonely one. And you go on and on and on. You see the lonely one. Lonely so lonely...lonely so lie. Lonely so lonely...lonely so lie. Now you're the only, only one...."
love is the hero,There is a course in life...so all the teachers say. It calls you day and night...it takes your thoughts away. Under a frozen light you face a long crusade. Where there's a cause you fight...where there's a cost you pay. Find an empty heart...you feel the passion play. It's when reactions start that you can't look away. There is no wrong or right--there's just your point of view. But when you face the light then it will come to you. Love is the hero...soldier forever. Life below zero...never say never. There is no sacrifice...there is no dead-end street. There is no sound advice...only the watch you keep. With every step you take through every room of fear. With every move you make the song will pull you near. Turn you world around and it will come your way. Through your cold-chill nights and in your hard-earned days. When you face the light it may be hard to do. But when it's all too right then it will come to you. Love is the hero...soldier forever. Love is the hero...you live to remember. No path is too steep...no distance too wide. No question too deep...no force can divide. You fortune you seek...the road will unwind. You're comin' to me...to search is to find. And when you start to fall into that frozen space. And when you reach the wall and there's no sunny place. And when it all comes down you make it anyhow...anyway. Love is the hero....
lover,I was green in my younger days. Full of plans but not much knowin'. Tried my hand at the game of love. But I was so naive. From the shelter of mama's wings. Learned to fly but I was broken. By a woman of 25. When I was just 19. Didn't know where to find myself. The rules they were not so simple. Makes no sense tryin' to face this world. 'Til you're old enough to fight. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. Lover...never thought that I would see the light. I was hungry in '81. For a time I thought I'd found her. Found myself on the road again. Freezin' from the cold. Fortune found me in '82. With a girl from way down under. She seemed like the natural thing. I thought I knew for sure. Tried to hold her--I could not see. Past her eyes was a spell unbroken. Battered visions and frozen dreams. That would never see the light...now you're my. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. Lover...someone told me it comes once-in-a-lifetime. Lover...never thought that I would see the light. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. It's a long road to salvation. People say nothin' lasts forever. But when it comes to the bottom line. When I make it I'll see you there...see you there. Once in a lifetime.... Now we're lookin' on better times. It seems like a miracle. But I'll never forget those days. I'm ready now to fight...for you my. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. Lover...someone told me it comes once-in-a-lifetime. Lover...never thought that I would see the light. Lover...you're the reason I'll be home tonite. Once in a lifetime....
lovin' you ain't so hard,"Oh...it's all clear to me now. Oh, oh-oh...it all comes through to me now. Sleep-walkin' through a frozen dream. Wakin' up from a fantasy. Where happiness got the best of me. Those dreams only go so far. Some people have a place inside. Where you can run, but you just can't hide. 'Til one fine day I pushed my fears aside. 'Cause lovin' you ain't so hard. Lovin' you ain't so hard. Turn on your light...now I won't go far. 'Cause lovin' you ain't so hard. Love...it's not easy to know. Sometimes...it's so hard to let go. Many times I tried to walk away. Listened long to what my friends would say. Only to find out at the end of the day. They'd taken me just so far. No more wanderin'...I'm almost home. Only a fool would walk this earth alone. When he could have your smile to call his own. Now lovin' you ain't so hard. Lovin' you ain't so hard. Turn off your light...now I won't get far. 'Cause lovin' you ain't so hard. Lovin' you ain't so hard. You cast your light out of the shadows. You spread your light in front of me. You cast your light out of the shadows. Shadow me. Lovin' you ain't so hard. Lovin' you ain't so hard. Turn on your light...now I won't go far. 'Cause lovin' you ain't so hard. Lovin' you ain't so hard. Turn off your light...now I won't get far. 'Cause loving you ain't so hard. Lovin' you ain't so hard. Lovin' you ain't so hard. Lovin' you ain't so hard."
mind-machine,I saw you for the first time yesterday. You looked at me but somethin' wasn't right. A face I thought I'd come to know by heart. Now hidden by a mask with no reveal. Just when I thought I knew you. I can feel no pulse inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you stripped my senses clean. I can feel no pulse...there's just your mind-machine. You say that you got feelin's just like me. You prove it as you throw me out the door. I'm reelin' from your sensitivity. Is this the shape of better things to come. I'm frightened for the future. I can feel no pulse inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you stripped my senses clean. I can feel no pulse...inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you broke my mind-machine. Inside your world it's cold and blue as ice. Where no one speaks and no one need reply. To questions that I've asked a thousand times. No answer to the riddles that you keep. It must be hard to be you. I can feel no pulse inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you stripped my senses clean. I can feel no pulse...inside your mind-machine. I can feel no pulse...you broke my mind-machine.
mine tonite,"Another time, another place for you and me. Is that the way it has to be. I can see it in your eyes--I can feel it inside. This is real--now we're right back where we started. Stolen hours are all we ever know. It's so hard to let you go. And in the air that I breathe there's a chill when you leave. Don'tcha know--one day will be forever. I don't care what's wrong or right. I only know you are mine tonite. And for a while we can hold on tight. That's all I know--you are mine tonite. Simple answers we may never find. Tell your heart to give it time. Now there's a road if we dare--no one said love was fair. But one day--one day we'll be together. I don't care what's wrong or right. I only know you are mine tonite. And for a while we can hold on tight. That's all I know--you are mine tonite. Oh-oh--am I lost in this dream, I can't escape. Oh-oh--there must be some way outa here. But to live without you would be more than I can take."
my kinda lover,"You got me runnin' baby. You give me somethin' way beyond revenue. You put the magic in me. I feel the magic when we do what we do. And oh....

And oh.... I been thinkin' 'bout you for so long. I don't wanna lose ya--you're my kinda lover...."
nerves on ice,"You don't need the papers to read between the lines. And you don't need the grapevine to say what's on your mind. Hangin' on the corner in the opera of the street. Eyes of imitation on everyone you meet. Dance to the music--sing to my song. Come to the party--and bring your friends along, listen. Roll over...get down. Gonna make you...right now. So heavy...so nice. We'll put your...nerves on ice. I been to the banker and I been to see the queen. Six of seven wonders have I made out of my dreams. I could be a junkie--I could be like you. We could be together...then what would we do. Life for the takin' is just outside your door. Time is the one thing that no one can afford. LISTEN.... Roll over...right now. Gonna make you...get down. So heavy...s'all right. We'll put your nerves on ice. Don't let them bring you down. Don't let them turn you upside down. Only the strong survive.... And no one here gets out alive. Call for the doctor--you can call out for a priest. But you can't take it with you when they're taggin' your disease. There're no easy lessons--and there're no guarantees. But you can go the distance be what you want to be. Stand where you're able...leave with your pride. Come to the table and throw down for your side, listen. Roll over...get down. You're gonna like it...and how. So heavy...so right. We'll put your nerves on ice. Don't let them bring you down. Don't let them turn you upside down. ...Don't think twice. ...Nerves on ice. Don't let them bring you down. Don't let them leave you on the edge of town. ...Don't think twice. ...Nerves on ice."
nobody knows,I may get around...I may laugh alot.... Now you'd think that I'd be happy with the life I got. Nobody knows...nobody sees. Ain't nobody really knows the inner side o'me.... I may seem secure...I could have it made.... You might think you see a lucky man who made the grade. Nobody knows what dreams I see. Ain't nobody really sure just who they wanna be.... But everybody has a place and time.... A chance to live...a need to find. We all got somethin' that we care about. I propose you find it out.... It's not in a book...or a magazine.... Or the stars who guide our fortunes on the silver screen. Nobody knows...it's up to me. Ain't nobody who can say it like it outght to be.... I see my future at the rainbow's end. Happy hours...timeless friends. And if I ever chance to find my way. Rest assured...I will stay.... You may see your life as a compromise. You may live to find the promise dancin' in your eyes. Nobody knows...it's meant to be.... Let the magic of the moment say it all to me. (Dedicated to the life of John Lennon).

one good woman,"I been a traveller for more than too few years. I learned my lessons...I stilled my fears. My sole possessions--they steer me through it all. Sweet dreams and innocence--the cushion my falls. Feel the passion run you blind. See the vision dancin' in my mind. One good woman, who's all of what she seems. One good woman to share my dreams. One good woman--put all the games aside. One good woman--make the most of our lives. . We live a life of fact and fantasy. We alter circumstance to fit our needs. We gain in fortune, but we lose in time. One door will open and one will close behind. Find the loner from the pack. Storm the mansions--I ain't never turnin' back. . One good woman...she's all I hope to find. One good woman--think of me in kind. One good woman..she won't get me down. One good woman--turn my head around. . Keepin' her distance..but oh she don't let go. One good woman...she makes it so. Over the air-waves, or across the sea. One good woman...she's more than enough for me."

You left me with a shuttered feeling. And something that was most revieling. I could see you were conceiling. Something that you turned out of control. I wonder now its been so long. Maybe we could get along somehow. But that night would you notice me. Shrouded in your luxury and gold. While me I'm out here kicking sand. Scrounging after all I can. How's it feel to see a real man. Struggling just to save his very soul. Dont tell me its out of your control. I know. Take me to your dreams at night. Maybe if the time is right you'll come. So late. And take me to the nursery. Take me down for all your friends to see. But tell me what you plan to do. When all you're wonderous dreams come true. Who'll be there to stand by you. To soothe the pain thats eating out your soul. Don't ask me its out of my control. Yeah its out of my control. Yeah its out of my control. Yeah its out of my control. Yeah its out of my control.

reach for the sky,"A spark of life--a beat in time. A lonely light that longs to shine. An open road that knows no end. A ray of hope around the bend. You got a dream--you wanna fly.

Some deliver--and some will reach for the sky. . You may be right--you can go wrong. You find the strength to carry on. Run satellite--your star unknown. And chase the light that guides you home. Live for the fight--fight to be free. You're facin' down reality. Where others fall, you take your stand. Answer the call--your heart's command. . Reach for the sky--reach for the sky. Some men will question--some will deny. Some find answers--and some will reach for the sky. . Fight the fight day by day. Sing your song come what may. Race the storm--turn the tide. Some can never be denied. . You walk alone through rings of fire. You never lose your one desire. Look for the sight that's hard to see. And know that all is meant to be. You take your dream and make it real. And see the truth it must reveal. And in your heart that truth will shine. Your cause will stand the test of time. . Reach for the sky--reach for the sky. Some men will vanish--some will survive. Some go restless--and some will reach for the sky. ."

The eyes of a man...see the world of a child. The door it lies open--won't you step inside and see the. Stranger...stranger to myself. I was born on the other side of life. I'm just a stranger...stranger to myself. Who's to fall if you won't try. Who's to fall if you won't try...you won't try...you don't wanna try. Stranger to myself."
stronger,"I will live for you--I want you to believe in me. Cause I believe in you--I know how strong the fire can be. I been searchin' all my life. To find a cause worth fightin' for. When you came into my life. This feelin' cuts right through. I feel it gettin' stronger. Stronger every day. Stronger through the night. Stronger for the pain. 'Cause we made it all right. Stronger when we kiss. After every fight. There's no stronger love than this. Baby hold on tight. I'll be there for you--no matter what the odds will be. When I reach out for you--I know that you'll be there for me. When I look upon my life. I see the ground I walked before. Tears have fallen like the rain. Life changes we go through. They make us even stronger. Stronger every day. Stronger through the night. Stronger for the pain. 'Cause we made it all right. Stronger when we kiss. After every fight. There's no stronger love than this...baby, baby. Stronger in your arms. Stronger on my own. Stronger than the fear of bein' alone. And if we live a thousand lifetimes. They could never tear us apart. Our dream can last forever. I feel the beat in my heart. Stronger in your arms. Stronger on my own. Stronger than the fear of bein' alone. Stronger when we kiss. After every fight. Stronger for the pain. 'Cause we made it all right. I'll be there for you--you'll be there for me. 'Stronger' is the word and I know we'll be. Stronger every day. Stronger through the night. There's no stronger love than this. Baby hold on tight."
sweet release,Destiny's a road we ride. Sight unseen--our thoughts untried. Through the years--a million miles. A trial of errors--a life of trials. There's a sign along the highway. There's a candle by my bed. There's a face in the doorway. There's a price on my head. . Sweet release...come in peace. Sweet release...won't you carry me on. Sweet release...my falls increase. Sweet release...I'm not that strong. . Sex machine will break you down. Strip you clean and take your crown. Wasted nights--rise and fall. One-way lights--they hide it all. Now I stand before the mirror. Hold the candle to my face. I can feel the scars burnin'. But they don't leave a trace. . Sweet release...rest in peace. Sweet release...I toss and turn. Sweet release...come and teach me. Sweet release...we never learn. . Black and white is black and red. None are right--but some are dead. Through every life the war drags on. Our hopes and dreams lie ripped and torn. . Sweet release...give us peace. Sweet release...won't you carry me on. Sweet release...will it never cease. Sweet release...can't you see I'm not that strong.
take a look behind ya,"There's trouble on the rise--you can see it in the eyes of the livin'. There's an order to defy--there's a room at the back of your mind. Word gets out--what's it all about. Some take it in and some can do without. Don't hang out in the shadow of a doubt. It's time you split before they sign you out. They'll have you sing the blues.... . Take a look behind ya. Take it on the run. Take a look behind ya. Look into the risin' sun. . You can dance, you can sing, but it doesn't mean a thing without rhythm. You can slip--slide--stumble through the rest of your life. Time won't stop--never gonna stop ya. You push the limit 'til the day you drop. Time don't stop--race against the clock. You shun the risk--can you stand the shock. You got a lot to lose.... . Take a look behind ya. Take it on the run. Take a look behind ya. Look into the risin' sun. . Take a look behind ya. Take it as it comes. Take a look behind ya. Don't forget the things you done. . You can run--you can hide but you never put aside what you're feelin'. Keep your balance--keep your stride--let it run through the heart of your life. Time don't stop--ready or not. You've got to give it everything you got. Life don't stop--take it to the top.... You miss a step feel the anchor drop. It all comes back to you.... ."

the girl's all right,"Got myself a woman...or I should say I try. To keep the faith 'fore it gets too late. Hold her down when she wants to fly. Always tryin' to tell me...how it ought to be. And if I treat her right then she won't be the end of me. I don't know why.... She cast my life in shame. But everytime she walk I seem to fall down on my honor. She's got rhythm...rocks me to my soul. Hey!...the girl's all right. She's got rhythm...steers me when I roll. Hey!...the girl's all right. What's she tryin' to say. Does she ever hear me at all. Everyday there's somethin' that she wants. Tells me things that I can't recall. Nails me down--she's a hammer. Can't see no way out. Of all the ways you can run these days--you can't out-run the mouth. I don't know why. At times she can go on. But if by chance we meet I know. With her it won't be wrong. She's got rhythm...rocks me to my soul. Hey!...the girl's all right. She's got rhythm...scares me, then I know. Hey!...the girl's all right. Sometimes I fail to notice...sometimes I play too rough. But when I feel I'm losin' her. Well then I've had enough. Knows my limitations...and she always calls my bluff. I take back what I said tonight. She's got rhythm...rocks me to my soul. Hey!...the girl's all right. She's got rhythm...scares me, then I know. Hey!...the girl's all right."

the stroke,"Now everybody have you heard. If you're in the game, then the stroke's the word. Don't take no rhythm, don't take no style. Got a thirst for killin', grab your vile.... . You put your right hand out give a firm hand-shake. Talk to me about that one big break.... Spread your ear-pollution both far and wide....

the work song,"You're born into life--learn to discover. They take you for life--no time to recover. Work, baby work. Roll with the mob--dance to the rhythm. Give all you got and take what you're given. Work, baby work. Hold back the pain--fight for the fever. Work for your girl--work hard to relieve her. Work, baby work. Everyday you fight with your job. Fight with your lover hold back the mob. Run for your cover. Work, baby work. Break out tonite--reach out, now don't let go. Put all your guns away. Turn out the light--reach out, now let me know.

tied up,"In the heart of the night you come on like fire. In the light of dawn leave me cold and tired. When you think of love. Tell me what you see. And when you dream, do ya dream of me. Feel the passion deep inside. It's in your blood and you just can't hide. You want some lovin' but your heart's tied up. Try to run but you can't say stop. Hold me baby--take me higher. Take a chance--set your world on fire. You want some lovin' but your heart's tied up. Now the truth is out--honey can't you see. I'm tied to you and you belong to me. But when we get too close I feel you push away. Nothin' I do's gonna make you stay. Tears are clashin'--worlds collide. You won't let go and you don't know why. You want some lovin' but your heart's tied up. Gimme fever--you burn me hot. Touch me baby--walk the wire. Tell me 'no'--then your heart's a liar. You need some lovin' but your heart's tied up. Try to run but you can't say stop. Hold me baby--take me higher. Take a chance--set your world on fire. You need some lovin' but your heart's tied up. Hold me baby--take me higher. Touch me baby--walk the wire. Roll me darlin'--light my fire. Spread your wings and love somebody."
til it's over,It's not over til it's over...it's not over til the end. It's not over til it's over...so we struggle to pretend. Hesitation makes you over...we all walk in our own way. Shadows deepen when it's over...through the summer of longer days. Cast in the call of a million smiles blown away. Everytime you fall it's a thousand times torn away. Castles built to fall with the sands of time wash away. No escapin' til it's over...friends will say it's not the same. Memories falter when it's over...some are lost and some remain. Someone take me when it's over...set a lantern by the door. Can't forget you...but I can't hold on...toss the anchor from off the shore. Cast in the call of a million smiles blown away. Everytime you fall it's a thousand times torn away. Castles built to fall with the sands of time wash away. Castles built to fall with the sands of time wash away. ...Will the moment come again. I still love you when it's over...I still want you to come again.
time-bomb,"I'm sittin' on a time-bomb. The world is like a time-bomb. And it's about to explode.... There once was a young boy...a modestly done boy. Who seemed pretty normal on sight. Wantin' for nothin'...but wantin' for somethin'. But mama made everything right. Inside her protection he learned of rejection. By a world that was not quite his own. He took his reward in a double-edged sword. Now the poor boy is always alone. He built himself a time-bomb. A ticking, talking time-bomb. It's about to explode under me. His world is like a time-bomb. A walking, talking time-bomb. It's about to explode under me. Now off on a new day...alone in her own way. A young girl waits by the phone. Longin' for daddy...she's missin' him badly. She knows that he's not comin' home. So down by the levee...her heart weighin' heavy. She knows that she's got to break free. She falls when she sees him...she knows how to please him. They can't see the woods for the trees. She built herself a time-bomb. A walking, talking time-bomb. It's about to explode under me. She's sittin' on a time-bomb. A ticking, talking time-bomb. It's about to explode under me. You gotta have faith late into the night. If there's another day...try to make it right. Find another way...shine another light. So now they're both older...their world growin' colder. And nothin' appears as it seemed. They look to their future...and the wounds that they nurture. And try to hold on to their dreams. This terrible twosome have really been through some. Scenes that they both know by heart. Mem'ries that jail them...support that has failed them. And they laugh but it tears them apart. We're sittin' on a time-bomb. A ticking, talking time-bomb. It's about to explode under me. This world is like a time-bomb. A walking, talking time-bomb. It's about to explode under me. The world is like a time-bomb. A ticking, talking time-bomb. We're sittin' on a time-bomb and it's about to explode. I see the enemy...and he looks like me. I see the enemy...and he looks like me. Looks a lot like you--looks a lot like me. Looks a lot like you--looks a lot like me."
too daze gone,"Walkin' through the streets just the other day. Caught up in the traffic--I can never get away. Runnin' here, runnin' there. No satisfaction anywhere. I do my work--ain't enough anymore. It takes the mornin' after to forget the night before. Too daze gone...too daze gone. I'm broke down, insufferable--my mind is on the blink. It's later than you think and I'm too daze gone. Went to see a friend just the other day. Had a drink or two and we blew the night away. Takin' in another show...how we live I'll never know. I can't remember the things that we said. Now all I got is this achin' in my head. Too daze gone...too daze gone. I'm broke down, insufferable--my mind is on the blink. It's later than you think and I'm too daze gone. Gone through the games that you want me to play. Gone past the rules that you put in my way. Racin' past your limit--ain't no right and wrong. Past the point of carin'--too daze gone. Couldn't raise my head just to save the day. I do my penance--try to keep the world at bay. Outa sight, outa mind...ills you don't expect to find. I learned my lesson a thousand times too. Don't make no impression--one thing I can do. Too daze gone...."
tryin' to walk a straight line,"Are you lookin' for adventure...are you lookin' at me. Are you gettin' enough...do you wanna break free. Look over your shoulder...you're one step older. Now I said to myself ""Self, there must be more than this"". I wanna know...I gotta step back from the fast-track heart-attack. Can you stand up tall...you know it's not an easy thing. Tryin' to walk a straight line. Would you get up and fight when it all goes south. Would you dare to be right in the shadow of doubt. Resist temptation...ya face the nation. When you know what you know...can you still say 'no'. C'mon...gotta get smart--make a new start--do your part. Turn it inside out...no it's not an easy thing. Tryin' to walk a straight line...try to be good to me. See the future walk past...now she's too daze gone. And the first will be last(lookout)...sing that same sad song. Behave your voice...behave your ass. Get into your cult...be good to yourself. Turn it inside out...you know it's not an easy thing. Tryin' to walk a straight line."
whadda you want from me,"Down in the dungeon I'm having a hard time. I get my love on condition and my Dewar's without lime. Up in the tower you're countin' the fault lines. (I say) I am who I am---whadda you want from me. Long distance warfare from over the phone lines. Terminal airfare--I'm crossin' the red line. Can't tell the diff'rence 'tween a ""wait"" and a ""walk"" sign. But you know who I am---whadda you want from me (nah yeah). You preach forgiveness but once in a dog's day. Naw but nobody listens to everything you say. You want the business, ya have it your own way. But you know who I am---whadda you want from me. Now I can't see no maybe, I can't see it at all. I seen through you baby, You wanna have it all...you take me to the wall. (ow!). Whadda you want from me.... (I said)you know who I am---whadda you want. I done what I can---take what you want. I am who I am---whadda you want from me."
wink of an eye,"I see you walkin' down the street...you could be walkin' in a dream. I see you goin' through the motions of a life where nothin's ever really what it seems. Chaste by a vision of love...how it's come down to you. Somethin' down inside is gonna make you wanna-gonna make you break through. It's your life...it goes down in the wink of an eye. It's your life...there you sit as the moments flash by. Chargin' day for night...chargin' grey for white. Chase the firelight...circular reason will leave you behind. Now you go walkin' down the street...you hear that someone call your name. Say you know, you gotta learn to live and learn to love and learn to lose and learn to live again. Run from the angel of night...now she's waitin' for you. It's your life...it goes down in the wink of an eye. It's your life...still you sit as it's passin' you by. Chargin' day for night...chargin' grey for white. Chase the firelight...wait for tomorrow we'll leave you behind. Run to your angel tonight...now she's waitin' for you. All you want...all you want. It's your life...it goes down in the wink of an eye. It's your life...don't you wait for the ashes to fly. Change your life...now don't sit as the moments flash by. Save your life...she'll be yours for the wink of an eye. Trade your day for night...turn your grey to white. Fight with fire, fight...wait for tomorrow and kiss me goodbye. It's your life...it goes down in the wink of an eye. It's your life...don't wait for the ashes to fly. Don't you break down. Don't you break down. Don't you get down. Don't you get down. Don't say there's no reason. Say there's no reason. Say there's no reason. No reason, no why. Don't get down. Don't let down."
you know what i like,"Somewhere in the distance---somewhere down the line. A trace of an illusion is etched upon my mind. A fool's infatuation poundin' in my brain. I fell into your face before I ever knew your name. You're no stranger--you know what I like.... You got me in a cross fire, drivin' in my car. You come on like a daydream, you move just like a star. Your lips are my persuasion, your love will be my cure. The path of least resistance is all I can endure. You're no stranger--you know what I like.... Miles of conversation...it's all between the lines. You're in the ""A"" rotation, you're with me all the time. Our love will go the distance--however near and far. In all of my confusion, I know just who you are. You're no stranger--you know what I like...."
young at heart,So you're out to change the world. You can do it none too fast. You don't want to see your future. Wash away into the past. Now a change is gonna come.... Say it's written on the streets. But there's a monkey on your back. ...Try to put him on a shelf. And you try to find in others. What you hide inside yourself. And you worry 'bout the war. And you try to understand. But forget about tomorrow. When you're playin' in the band. Stay young at heart. Stay young at heart. Now you've been around the world. Seen the shape of things to come. You begin to feel the damage. From the crazy things we've done. Now the lines are overdrawn. ...See 'em bleedin' down your face. And there's a sore and scary monster.... She's-a comin' after you. Stay young at heart. Stay young at heart. You can't be too wise. So open your eyes. Stay young at heart...yea. Now you're weary from the war. But it's time to start again. And you don't know what you're fightin' for. But you'll fight until the end. Now forget about the future. Don'tcha try to understand. There's no need to fear tomorrow. Just keep playin' in the band. Stay young at heart. Stay young at heart. You can't be too wise. So open your eyes. Stay young...stay young. Stay young at heart.
your love is my life,"Your love is my life--I live my life for your love. Only two can be right--yours are the arms that I'm dreamin' of. Though the powers that be may confuse me. I know in your heart you won't lose me. For once in my life my dream is alive. Never forgotten when I call out to you. Your love is my life--I live my life through your love. Always knew it could feel so right--yours are the arms that I'm dreamin' of. Though the powers that be may deceive me. I know in my heart you won't leave me. Our promise is made--our dream can come true. Crimes are forgotten when I call out to you. Though we're worlds apart, you're right by my side. The door it lies open--we're too hot to hide. For once in my life my feelin's are true. Time makes me certain--hear me call out to you. Your love is my life...."
