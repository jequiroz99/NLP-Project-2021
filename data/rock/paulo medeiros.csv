shape yourself,I can see behind. Your lonely and sad eyes. All the things you're trying. To do right now. Kill the shame and blame the guy. On your soul. Maybe your bones are weak. And with your kid voice. You can't say to (the) world how little you are. And try to avoid the guns. Against your life. Get ready to melt down. If you can't turn it at all. The smile of the sad king will turn you apart. Shape yourself and turn the world against you. Say some things that you can't say. At your own room. Kill the clock and say goodbye. Mr. health want to look in your eyes. You can't find a way to be fine. If your world can't turn around. And at the end of the day. That's the way I feel so stray. Get ready to melt down. If you can't turn it at all. The smile of the sad king will turn you apart. Shape yourself and turn the world against you. Say some things that you can't say. At your own room. Kill the clock and say goodbye. Mr. health want to look in your eyes. You can't find a way to be fine. If your world can't turn around. And at the end of the day. That's the way I feel so stray
who's joe?,You don't need questions. When your future is coming. Sorry boy that's not right. I don't need the easy way. Will I fall?. I will see with my own eyes. I'll tell you something. That you could use right now. I'll give you answers instead excuses. Hey joe. You gotta find someone. Who feels the world around you. You know. You gotta keep your place. And save your dreams from her eyes. You can't just pretend it. Cause the girl behind the door. Wants her own mind. Fake a borderline day. Are your parents on the way or you just die?. I'll tell you something. That you could use right now. I'll give you answers instead excuses. Hey joe. You gotta find someone. Who feels the world around you. You know. You gotta keep your place. And save your dreams from her eyes. Hey joe. You gotta find someone. Who feels the world around you. You know. You gotta keep your place. And save your dreams from her eyes. Hey joe. You gotta find someone. Who feels the world around you. You know. You gotta keep your place. And give your own beat a second heart
