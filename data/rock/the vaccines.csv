last friday night,There's a stranger in my bed. There's a pounding in my head. Glitter all over the room. Pink flamingos in the pool. I smell like a minibar. Dj's passed out in the yard. Barbie's on the barbeque. There's a hickie or a bruise. Pictures of last night. Ended up online. I'm screwed. Oh well. It's a black top blur. But I'm pretty sure it ruled. Last Friday night. We danced on tabletops. And we took too many shots. Think we kissed but I forgot. Last Friday night. We maxed our credit cards. And got kicked out of the bar. So we hit the boulevard. Last Friday night. Trying to connect the dots. Don't know what to tell my boss. Think the city towed my car. Chandelier is on the floor. With my favorite party dress. Warrants out for my arrest. Think I need a ginger ale. That was such an epic fail. Pictures of last night. Ended up online. I'm screwed. Oh well. It's a blacked out blur. But I'm pretty sure it ruled. Last Friday night. Yeah we danced on table tops. And we took too many shots. Think we kissed but I forgot. Last Friday night. We maxed our credits card. And got kicked out of the bars. So we hit the boulevards. Last Friday night. This Friday night. This Friday night. T.G.I.F.. T.G.I.F.. T.G.I.F.. T.G.I.F.. T.G.I.F.. T.G.I.F.. Last Friday night. We danced on table tops. And we took too many shots. Think we kissed but I forgot. Last Friday night. We maxed our credit cards. And got kicked out of the bar. So we hit the boulevard. Last Friday night. We went streaking in the park. Skinny dipping in the dark. Then had a menage a trois. Yeah I think we broke the law. Always say we're gonna stop. Oh-whoa-oh. Last Friday night. This Friday night. This Friday night
