without you,"I wanted you here beside me. 'cause this time of year gets so cold. Everyone is smiling so brightly. Can't pick myself off the floor. You walked out in november. And I just let you go. It was the biggest mistake because. Bells are ringing. All I hear is your voice still singing. Moving on was no choice. So I'll name our tree just like we used to. Christmas just isn't the same. Without you. December makes me remember. The way your eyes lit up the snow. You always promised forever. But I guess I'll never know. They say this is the most wonderful time of the year. But I just wanna disappear. And I think I'm losing my mind because. Bells are ringing. All I hear is your voice still singing. Moving on was no choice. So I'll name our tree just like we used to. Christmas just isn't the same. Without you. So what am I gonna do?. Can't go on like this. Oh, might as well throw out the mistletoe. 'cause it reminds me of your kiss. Bells are ringing. All I hear is your voice still singing. Moving on was no choice. So I'll name our tree just like we used to. Christmas just isn't the same. Without you"
