dreams,Now here you go again. You say you want your freedom. Well who am I to keep you down?. It's only right that you should. Play the way you feel it. But listen carefully to the sound. Of your loneliness. Like a heartbeat .. drives you mad. In the stillness of remembering what you had. And what you lost .... And what you had .... And what you lost. Thunder only happens when it's raining. Players only love you when they're playing. Say women they will come and they will go. When the rain washes you clean you'll know. You'll know. Now here I go again I see the crystal visions. I keep my visions to myself. It's only me who wants to. Wrap around your dreams and .... Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?. Dreams of loneliness.

Shacking up is all you wanna do. If I could. Baby I`d give you my world. Open up. Everything`s waiting for you. You can go your own way. Go your own way. You can call it. Another lonely day. You can go your own way. Go your own way.

Is it over now -- do you know how. Pick up the pieces and go home.. Rock on -- ancient woman. Follow those who pale. In your shadow. Rulers make bad lovers. You better put your kingdom up for sale. Did she make you cry. Make you break down. Shatter your illusions of love. Is it over now -- do you know how. Pickup the pieces and go home..

love minus zero/no limit,"Written by Bob Dylan. My love, she speaks like silence. Without ideals or violence. She doesn't have to say she's faithful. But she's true, like ice, like fire. People carry roses. Make promises by the hours. My love laughs like the flowers. Valentines can't buy her. In the dime stores and bus stations. People talk of situations. Read books, repeat quotations. Draw conclusions on the wall. Some speak of the future. My love, she speaks softly. She knows there's no success like failure. And that failure's no success at all. The cloak and dagger dangles. Madams light the candles. In ceremonies of the horsemen. Even the pawn must hold a grudge. Statues made of matchsticks. Crumble into one another. My love winks, she does not bother. She knows too much to argue or to judge. The bridge at midnight trembles. The country doctor rambles. Bankers' nieces seek perfection. Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring. The wind howls like a hammer. The night goes rainy. My love, she's like some raven. At my window with a broken wing. My love, she speaks like silence. Without ideals or violence. She doesn't have to say she's faithful. To all the gifts that wise men bring. The wind howls like a hammer. The night goes rainy. My love, she's like some raven. At my window with a broken wing."

miranda,music and lyrics by Lindsey Buckingham. At the end of the day. The end of the light. She remains of all of her foes. Miranda is dying with all of her might. She never comes. She always goes. She sticks the camera right into her arm. Anything to forget what the trouble's about. It causes her pain. That's part of the charm. She's down for the count. And finally out. Miranda is taking the stars down. A little something to call her own. By the light there still goes Miranda. And Miranda is always alone. She sees her face in another magazine. And the walls all close in. As the fancy takes flight. Can't stand to be loved. But she loves to be seen. She slips headlong into the night. Miranda is taking the stars down. A little something to call her own. By the light there still goes Miranda. And Miranda is always alone. And then all at once. The sun starts to rise. She sees her father holding her down. All the daylight is poison to her eyes. She slips down the shade. And lets herself drown. Miranda is taking the stars down. A little something to call her own. By the light there still goes Miranda. And Miranda is always alone. The lights shot down in the arena. All across the safety zone. Loneliness follows Miranda. And Miranda is always alone. Miranda is always alone.

Sweet love to me. how high (ummm). how deep (ummm). how strong (ummm). how wide (ummm). how long (ummm)."

Are you dead or alive?. All the restless people and the bitter green. Well it fakes this gold, makes the spirit mean. Murrow turning over in his grave. Murrow turning over in his grave.

And all of the things that we say are very. Sentimental gentle wind. Blowing through my life again. Sentimental Lady. Gentle one. You are here and warm. But I could look away and you'd be gone. Cause we live in a time. When meaning falls in splinters from our lives. And that's why I've travelled far. Cause I come so together where you are. Yes and all of the things that I said that I wanted. Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you. 14 joys and a will to be merry. And all of the things that we say are very. Sentimental gentle wind. Blowing through my life again. Sentimental Lady. Gentle one. Sentimental gentle wind. Blowing through my life again. Sentimental Lady. Gentle one. Sentimental gentle wind. Blowing through my life again. Sentimental Lady. Gentle one. Well sentimental gentle wind. Blowing through my life again. Sentimental Lady. Gentle one."

silver girl,(Stevie Nicks). She was a silver girl. Lost in a high tech world. She was a golden girl. Immersed in a hard core world. She would have preferred. The last generation. But that's all right. She is on her way. She had the Midas touch. She was Lady Luck. She's got a million bucks. And she looks like it. She's had a few hard times. Sometimes it blows her mind. Those papers she never signed. Sometimes she remembers. Sometimes she was just an actress. But you'll never really know. A shadow moves across her face. You cannot see her soul. Unless she lets you. See her soul. She was a girlie girl. Caught in a man's world. And as her world turns. She feels old so alone. Still she's a danger girl. Insane far beyond her years. On some things she's very clear. She's a wild adventurer.

sisters of the moon,"Written by Stevie Nicks.. . Intense silence. As she walked in the room. Her black robes trailing. Sister of the moon. And a black widow spider makes. More sound than she. And black moons in those eyes of hers. Made more sense to me. Heavy persuasion. It was hard to breathe. She was dark at the top of the stairs. And she called to me. And so I followed. As friends often do. I cared not for love, nor money. I think she knew. The people, they love her. And still they are the most cruel. She asked me. Be my sister, sister of the moon. Some call her sister of the moon. Some say illusions are her game. Wrap her in velvet. Does anyone, ah, know her name. So we make our choices. When there is no choice. And we listen to their voices. Ignoring our own voice."

talkin' to my heart,"Written by Billy Burnette, Deborah Allen, and Rafe VanHoy.. . My heart is hanging on every word you say. Right now all logic's stripped away. It doesn't analyze your sincerity. It only listens and believes. Don't whisper. I love you. Unless you know it's true. Be careful what you're saying. You're talkin' to my heart. Oh be careful what you're saying. You're talkin' to my heart. Sometimes you want someone so bad you fantasize. Sometimes the heat of passion lies. It's only human to give in to what you feel. That doesn't always mean it's real. Don't mislead. Don't misread. The magic of the night. Be careful what you're saying. You're talkin' to my heart. Oh be careful what you're saying. You're talkin' to my heart. Think about it. Sometimes it's wise to wait. Think about it. Once spoken it's too late. Don't whisper. I love you. Unless you know it's true. Be careful what you're saying. You're talkin' to my heart. Oh be careful what you're saying. You're talkin' to my heart."

winds of change,"Written by Kit Hain.. . Tonight there's thunder in the sky. Just like the night you said good-bye. And what's left of a heartache. Runs like rain from my eyes. The winds of change. Gonna blow it all away. Ain't it strange. How you won't matter. The winds of change. Gonna blow it all away. I stood like a rock against the storm. And you never knew, did you, how I was torn. And if your memory finally leaves me too. Well I won't sit and mourn. The winds of change. Gonna blow it all away. Ain't it strange. How you won't matter. The winds of change. Gonna blow it all away. I shoulda known better than to love you. I shoulda known that you were the hurting kind. Now I'm so tired of thinking of you. I just wanna forget that you were ever mine. Tonight there's shadows on my face. Every one tells a story of your disgrace. But soon the dawn will come. And I'll be gone without a trace. The winds of change. Gonna blow it all away. Ain't it strange. How you won't matter. The winds of change. Gonna blow it all away. Ain't it strange. How you won't matter.... ."
wish you were here,"Written by Christine McVie and Colin Allen.. . There's distance between us. And you're on my mind. As I lay here in the darkness. I can find no peace inside. I wish you were here holding me tight. If I had you near it would make it alright. I wish you were here. 'Cause I feel like a child tonight. Rain on my window. I can count the drops. But I can't help feeling lonely. There's no way I can stop. I wish you were here holding me tight. If I had you near it would make it alright. I wish you were here. 'Cause I feel like a child tonight. Each moment is a memory. Time is so unkind. Every hour, filled with an emptiness I can't hide. There's distance between us. And you're on my mind. As I lay here in the darkness. I can find no peace inside. I wish you were here holding me tight. If I had you near it would make it alright. I wish you were here. 'Cause I feel like a child tonight."
