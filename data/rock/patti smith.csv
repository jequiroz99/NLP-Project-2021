Because the night belongs to lovers. because the night belongs to lust. because the night belongs to lovers. because the night belongs to us. have I doubt when I am alone. love is a ring on the telephone. love is an angel disguised as lust. here in our bed until the morning comes. come on now try and understand. the way I feel under your command. take my hands and the sun descends. they can't touch you now, can't touch you now. Because the night...etc. with love we sleep with doubt the vicious circle turn and turns. without you I cannot live, forgive the yearning burning.

birdland,"[lyrics by patti smith; music by patti smith, richard sohl, lenny kaye, ivan kral]. His father died and left him a little farm in New England.. All the long black funeral cars left the scene. And the boy was just standing there alone. Looking at the shiny red tractor. Him and his daddy used to sit inside. And circle the blue fields and grease the night.. It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars. 'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.. Then he put his head in the crux of his arm. And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,. Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it. And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,. He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,. And he was very different tonight. 'Cause he was not human, he was not human.. And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy. That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,. White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly. And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,. No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven. And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,. â€œNo, daddy, don't leave me here alone,. Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,. Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it. Where you're not human, you are not human.â€. But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.. Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm. And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered. And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet. Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting. And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake. Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,. All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,. â€œI won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,. I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,. Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship. And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human.â€. I am helium raven and this movie is mine,. So he cried out as he stretched the sky,. Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?. We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day. And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,. Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,. It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights. Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,. And he put up his hands and he said, â€œIt's me, it's me,. I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,. I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,. Don't leave me here!â€. The son, the sign, the cross,. Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,. The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons. No longer presidents but prophets. They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,. He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation. It's all gonna split his skull. It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining. Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up. Like light, like Mohammed Boxer. Take them up up up up up up. Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,. I'm going up, I'm going up. Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there. Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up. Up, up to the belly of a ship.. Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it. Where we are not human, we're not human.. Well, there was sand, there were tiles,. The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated. Like a river of glass. When it hardened he looked at the surface. He saw his face. And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,. Where there were eyes there were just two white opals. And he looked up and the rays shot. And he saw raven comin' in. And he crawled on his back and he went up. Up up up up up up. Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,. Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,. Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,. We like birdland..

blue poles,"by Patti Smith. Mother as I write the sun dissolves. Blood life streaming cross my hand. And these words, these words. Hope dashed immortal hope. Hope streaking the canvas sky. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. We joined the long caravan. Hungry dreaming going west. Just for work just to get a job. And we never got lucky. We just forged on. And the dust the endless dust. Like a plague it covered everything. Hal fell with the fever. And mother I did what I could. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. We prayed we prayed for rain. I never wanted to see the sun again. All my dresses you made by hand. We left behind on the road. Hal died in my arms. We buried him by the river. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write."

people have the power,I was dreaming in my dreaming. of an aspect bright and fair. and my sleeping it was broken. but my dream it lingered near. in the form of shining valleys. where the pure air recognized. and my senses newly opened.

The people have the power. The people have the power. The people have the power. Vengeful aspects became suspect. and bending low as if to hear. and the armies ceased advancing. because the people had their ear. and the shepherds and the soldiers. lay beneath the stars. exchanging visions. and laying arms. to waste / in the dust. in the form of / shining valleys. where the pure air / recognized. and my senses / newly opened. I awakened / to the cry. Refrain. Where there were deserts. I saw fountains. like cream the waters rise. and we strolled there together. with none to laugh or criticize. and the leopard. and the lamb. lay together truly bound. I was hoping in my hoping. to recall what I had found. I was dreaming in my dreaming. god knows / a purer view. as I surrender to my sleeping. I commit my dream to you. Refrain. The power to dream / to rule. to wrestle the world from fools. it's decreed the people rule. it's decreed the people rule. LISTEN. I believe everything we dream. can come to pass through our union. we can turn the world around. we can turn the earth's revolution. we have the power.

babelogue,"I haven't fucked much with the past, but I've fucked plenty with the future.. Over the skin of silk are scars from the splinters of stations and walls I've caressed.. A stage is like each bolt of wood, like a log of Helen, is my pleasure.. I would measure the success of a night by the way by the way by the amount of piss and seed I could exude over the columns that. nestled the P.A.. Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off with a skirt of green net sewed over with flat metallic circles which dazzled and. flashed.. The lights were violet and white. I had an ornamental veil, but I couldn't bear to use it.. When my hair was cropped, I craved covering, but now my hair itself is a veil, and the scalp inside is a scalp of a crazy and sleepy. Comanche lies beneath this netting of the skin.. I wake up. I am lying peacefully I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun.. I desire him, and he is absolutely ready to seize me. In heart I am a Moslem; in heart I am an American;. In heart I am Moslem, in heart I'm an American artist, and I have no guilt.. I seek pleasure. I seek the nerves under your skin.. The narrow archway; the layers; the scroll of ancient lettuce.. We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly, the mole on the belly of an exquisite whore.. He spared the child and spoiled the rod. I have not sold myself to God."

All the long black funeral cars left the scene. And the boy was just standing there alone. Looking at the shiny red tractor. Him and his daddy used to sit inside. And circle the blue fields and grease the night.. It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars. 'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.. Then he put his head in the crux of his arm. And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,. Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it. And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,. He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,. And he was very different tonight. 'Cause he was not human, he was not human.. And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy. That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,. White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly. And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,. No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven. And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,. â€œNo, daddy, don't leave me here alone,. Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,. Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it. Where you're not human, you are not human.â€. But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.. Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm. And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered. And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet. Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting. And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake. Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,. All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,. â€œI won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,. I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,. Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship. And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human.â€. I am helium raven and this movie is mine,. So he cried out as he stretched the sky,. Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?. We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day. And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,. Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,. It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights. Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,. And he put up his hands and he said, â€œIt's me, it's me,. I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,. I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,. Don't leave me here!â€. The son, the sign, the cross,. Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,. The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons. No longer presidents but prophets. They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,. He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation. It's all gonna split his skull. It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining. Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up. Like light, like Mohammed Boxer. Take them up up up up up up. Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,. I'm going up, I'm going up. Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there. Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up. Up, up to the belly of a ship.. Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it. Where we are not human, we're not human.. Well, there was sand, there were tiles,. The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated. Like a river of glass. When it hardened he looked at the surface. He saw his face. And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,. Where there were eyes there were just two white opals. And he looked up and the rays shot. And he saw raven comin' in. And he crawled on his back and he went up. Up up up up up up. Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,. Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,. Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,. We like birdland..

blue poles,"by Patti Smith. Mother as I write the sun dissolves. Blood life streaming cross my hand. And these words, these words. Hope dashed immortal hope. Hope streaking the canvas sky. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. We joined the long caravan. Hungry dreaming going west. Just for work just to get a job. And we never got lucky. We just forged on. And the dust the endless dust. Like a plague it covered everything. Hal fell with the fever. And mother I did what I could. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. We prayed we prayed for rain. I never wanted to see the sun again. All my dresses you made by hand. We left behind on the road. Hal died in my arms. We buried him by the river. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write. Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write."
boy cried wolf,"Oh the story's told been told retold. From the sacred scriptures to the tabloids. All the fuss and fight none above a whisper. The soul of gold the belly of a boy. Well they drew him from the forest. Like they draw blood. Tied him to a tree like St. Sebastian. And he turned his head and let the arrows fly. Through the trees, the trees. The ornamental leaves. Boy cried wolf. Wolf don't come. Wolf within. Boy cried wolf. In the ancient mold they're dancing down. Calling to the moon but it don't answer. And they fell on their knees. and passed the bowl around. And the blood the blood the sacramental blood. Boy cried wolf. Wolf don't come. Wolf within. Boy cried wolf. I am the body I am the stream. I am the wake of everything. They bring me flowers that are myself. Garlands of blood that are myself. Slain the lamb that is himself. Torn reborn the cries of our dismay. Are nothing to the wind but whose to mind. Kings are lifted up and kings are thrown. Lost received retrieved. The human tide. Innocence had its day. Innocence had its day. Innocence innocence"
break it up,"Car stopped in a clearing,. Ribbon of life, it was nearing.. I saw the boy break out of his skin.. My heart turned over and I crawled in.. He cried, â€œBreak it up, oh I don't understand,. Break it up, I can't comprehend.. Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.. Break it up, don't talk to me that way,. I'm not listening.â€. Snow started falling,. I could hear the angel calling.. We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.. The boy flew away and he started to sing.. He sang, â€œBreak it up, oh, I don't understand.. Break it up, I can't comprehend.. Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.. Break it up, don't look at me.â€. The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,. I fell on my knee. Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.. I cried, â€œTake me please!â€. Ice, it was shining.. I could feel my heart, it was melting.. I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.. I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.. I cried, â€œBreak it up, oh, now I understand.. Break it up, and I want to go.. Break it up, oh please take me with you.. Break it up, I can feel it breaking,. I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,. I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.â€. So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.. Break it up, now I'm gonna go.. Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.. Break it up, break it up, break it up,. Break it up, break it up, break it up,. Oh, break it up, break it up, break it up. Break it up, break it up, break it on up. Break it up, break it on up, up, up. Break it, break it, break it, break it. Break it on up, break it up,. Break it up, break it up, break it up ...."
broken flag,"Nodding tho the lamp's lit low, nod for passers underground.. To and fro she's darning, and the land is weeping red and pale.. Weeping yarn from Algiers. Weeping yarn from Algiers.. Weaving tho the eyes are pale, what will rend will also mend.. The sifting cloth is binding, and the dream she weaves will never end.. For we're marching toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers.. Lullaby tho baby's gone. Lullaby a broken song.. Oh, the cradle was our call. When it rocked we carried on.. And we marched on toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers. We're still marching for Algiers. Marching, marching for Algiers.. Not to hail a barren sky. Sifting cloth is weeping red.. The mourning veil is waving high a field of stars and tears we've shed.. In the sky a broken flag, children wave and raise their arms.."

cartwheels,"Come my one, look at the world Bird beast butterfly. Girls sing notes of heaven Birds lift them up to the sky. Spring is departing Spring is departing. Her thoughts are darting like a rabbit Like a rabbit 'cross the moon. Shines of light over your hair As boys croon. Pretty in pink It makes me wonder. What could ever bring you down I see tears falling. From those eyes of brown. Hearing a voice, you turn your head You vanish into the mist. Of your thoughts And I. Want to grasp What brings you down. Open up those eyes of brown. The world is changing Your heart is growing. Hearing a voice you turn your head Girls turn by ones, by twos. Notes pour bad and tender Eradicate your blues. The good world The good world. Come my one, look around you Bird, beast, butterfly. Girls sing notes from heaven Birds lift them up to the sky. I see brown eyes That see girls turning. Girls turning Cartwheels. The good world The good whirl. The good world The good whirl. Come my one, look at your world Don't let it bring you down. Come on open for me Those eyes of brown.

cash,"Here we go around again Curve of life spiraling. Everything we've ever known As the seed of life gets blown. And the miracle of time When will that time just end. Remember, you decide Take that vow. Grab that ring It's not a whim. Not a whim When you be cashing in. Try to turn your life around And all the things you do resound. And then you can't loose control Say your time has come and then. Hard to pinpoint find the seam Where that one time ends. Where that time begins Remember, you decide. Take that vow Take a stand. Grab that ring It's not a whim. It's not a whim It's only time. That you're cashing in. In the white noise of desire. We can't hear a single thing. Floating round the fragile bough Afflictions of the human soul. Its beauty immaterial. You decide Stand along. The fallen ones Take revenge. Defeated sons Rend that coat. From seam to seam It's only time. It's only time That you spend. You spend It's only time. You spend Its only time. You spend It's only life. That you're cashing in"
changing of the guard,"Sixteen years. Sixteen banners united over the field. Where the good shepherd grieves. Desperate men, desperate women divided. Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves.. Fortune calls. I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace. Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down. She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born. On midsummer's eve near the tower.. The cold-blooded moon. The captain waits above the celebration. Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid. Whose ebony face is beyond communication. The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.. They shaved her head. She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo. A messenger arrived with a black nightingale. I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow. Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.. I stumbled to my feet. I rode past destruction in the ditches. With the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo. Renegade priests and treacherous young witches. Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.. The palace of mirrors. Where dog soldiers are reflected. The endless road and the wailing of chimes. The empty rooms where her memory is protected. Where the angel's voices whisper to the souls of previous times.. She wakes him up. Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking. Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks. She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking. He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.. Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes. I've moved your mountains and marked your cards. But Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination. Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.. Peace will come. With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire. But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall. And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating. Between the King and the Queen of Swords."

come back little sheba,by Patti Smith. Come back little Sheba. I hear them calling. Open your ears. Awake from thy sleep. High above. The stars are falling. Open your arms. And you shall receive. The lights of the city. So bold and flashing. All of its riches. Imparted to thee. Robes of saffron. Robes of standing. A road of crimson. Spread at your feet. Your robes of standing. Your robes of saffron. Your road of crimson. All pleasing to me. But close your lights. Close your gates. I must arise. My flock awaits. Farewell little Sheba. I hear them a'calling. Here is your staff. Tend to thy sheep. Good wishes be with you. If that be your calling. Farewell little Sheba. Arise and take leave.
constantine's dream,"In Arezzo I dreamed a dream. Of Saint Francis who kneeled and prayed. For the birds and the beasts and all humankind. All through the night I felt drawn in by him. And I heard him call. Like a distant hymn. I retreated from the silence of my room. Stepping down the ancient stones washed with dawn. And entered the basilica that bore his name. Seeing his effigy I bowed my head. And my racing heart I gave to him. I kneeled and prayed. And the sleep that I could not find in the night. I found through him. I saw before me the world of his world. The bright field,the birds in abundance. All of nature of which he sang. Singing of him. All the beauty that surrounded him as he walked. His nature that was nature itself. And I heard him-I heard him speak. And the birds sang sweetly. And the wolves licked his feet. But I could not give myself to him. I felt another call from basilica itself. Tha call of art-the call of man. And the beauty of material drew me away. And I awoke,and beheld upon the wall. The dream of Constantine. The handiwork of Piero della Francesca. Who had stood where I stood. With his brush stroked The Legend of the True Cross. He envisioned Constantine advancing to greet the enemy. But as he was passing the river. An unaccustomed fear gripped his bowels. An anticipation so overwhelming that it manifested in waves. All through the night a dream drew toward him. As an advancing Crusade. He slept in his tent on the battlefield. While his men stood guard. And an angel awoke him. Constantine within his dream awoke. And his men saw a light pass over the face of the king. The troubled King. And the angel came and showed to him. The sign of the true cross in heaven. And upon it was written. (In this sign shall thou conquer). In the distance the tents of his army were lit by moonlight. But another king of radiance lit the face of Constantine. And in the morning light. The artist,seeing his work was done. Saw that it was good. (In this sign shall thou conquer). He let his brush drop and passed into a sleep of his own. And he dreamed of Constantine carrying into battle in his right hand. An immaculate,undefiled single white Cross. Piero della Francesca,as his bursh stroked the wall. Was filled with a torpor. And fell into a dream of his own. From the geometry of his heart he mapped it out. He saw the King rise,fitted with armor. Set upon a white horse. An immaculate cross in his right hand. He advanced toward the enemy. And the symmetry,the perfection of his mathematics. Caused the scattering of the enemy. Agitated,broken,they fled. And Piero della Francesca waking,cried out. All is art-all is future!. Oh lord let me die on the back of advanture. With a brush and an eye full of light. But as he advanced in age. The light was shorn from his eyes. And blinded,he laid upon his bed. On an October moring 1492,and whispered. Oh lord let me die on the back of adventure. Oh lord let me die on the back of adventure. And a world away-a world away. On three great ships. Adventure itself as if to answer. Pulling into the New World. And as far as his eyes could see. No longer blind. All of nature unspoiled-beautiful-beautiful. In such a manner that would have lifted the heart of St.Francis. Into the realm of universal love"

dead city,by Patti Smith. This dead city longs to be. This dead city longs to be free. Seven screaming horses. Melt down in the sun. Building scenes on empty dreams. And smoking them one by one. This dead city longs to be. This dead city longs to be living. Is it any wonder there's squalor in the sun. With their broken schemes and their lotteries. They never get nowhere. Is it any wonder they're spitting at the sun. God's parasites in abandoned sites. and they never have much fun. If I was a blind man. Would you see for me. Or would you confuse. The nature of my blues. And refuse a hand to me. Is it any wonder crying in the sun. Is it any wonder I'm crying in the sun. Well I built my dreams on your empty scenes. Now I'm burning them one by one. This damn city this dead city. Immortal city. Motor city. Suc-cess city. Longs to be. Longs to be. Free. Free.

I formed me a presence whose aspect was changing. oh he would shift he would not shift at all. we sat for a while he was very engaging. and when he was gone I was gone on a smile. With a strange way of walking. and a strange way of breathing. more lives than a cat. that let me astray. all in all he captured my heart. dead to the world and just. slipped away. I heard me a music that drew me to dancing. lo I turned under his spell. I opened my coat but he never came closer. I bolted the door and whispered oh well. With a strange way of walking. and a strange way of breathing. more lives than a cat. that let me astray. all in all he captured my heart. dead to the world and just. slipped away. I laid in the rushes the air was upon me. wondering well I just couldn't discern. will he come back come back to me. oh I whispered will you ever return. I was feeling sensations in no dictionary. he was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke. the life in his fingers unwound my existence. dead to the world alive I awoke. With a strange way of walking. and a strange way of breathing. less than a breath of shimmer and smoke. the life in his fingers unwound my existence. dead to the world alive I awoke. alive I awoke. alive alive I awoke. alive I awoke. alive I awoke. alive.

death singing,by Patti Smith. . In the straw-colored light. In light rapidly changing. On a life rapidly fading. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. With a throat smooth as a lamb. Yet dry as a branch not snapping. He throws back his head. And he does not sing a thing mournful. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. In the straw-colored light. He sings a black embrade. And white opals swimming. In a child's leather purse. Have you seen death swimming. Have you seen death swimming. With a throat smooth as a lamb. Yet dry as a branch not snapping. He throws back his head. And he does not sing a thing mournful. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. Have you seen death singing. In the straw-colored light. He sings of youth enraged. And the burning of Atlanta. And these viral times. And May ribbons streaming. And straw-colored curls a-turning. A mother's vain delight. And woe to the sun. And woe to the young. Another hearse is drawn. Have you seen death singing.

don't say nothing,by Patti Smith. Lower the thing the skin of a cat. Skin it to the left just laying there. No other thing is luck like that. And you set it said it said nothing. Went to the party very discouraged. I watched the litter pile like a wall. I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it. It was ladened with all kinds of shit. Still I admit that I didn't say nothing. I turned my back walked away. Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing. Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner. I was listening they were saying this and saying that. And putting this one down but nothing was delivered. Nothing good was coming I just stood there. I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing. I walked the floor then I looked away. Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing. How long how long will we make do. Maybe it's time to break on through. Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up. Gonna get well I'm gonna do something. Gonna face the fact gonna give it back. And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue. Won't hold the thought won't hold the card. Well I'm gonna do something. Oh my brain I got to complain. You can refrain but I'm gonna do something. How long how long will we make do. Maybe it's time to break on through. Out in the desert I saw that old cat skinned. I saw it floating in the river. I saw and no one seemed to mind. They sat there they sat there watching the sun. I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble. Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun. Spread its wings and fly away. And in the mountains a cry echoes. Don't say nothing. Don't say nothing no.

In all I do. Your thoughts your schemes. captivate my dreams. Everlasting, ever new. Sea returns to sea. And sky to sky. In a life of dream am I. When I'm with you. Deep in my heart. How the presence of you shines. In a light to last a whole life through. I recall the wonder of it all. Each dream of life I'll share with you. Sea returns to sea. And sky to sky. In a life of dream am I. When I'm with you. I'm with you always. You're ever on my mind. In a light to last a whole life through. The hand above. turns those leaves of love. All and all a timeless view. Each dream of life. Flung from paradise. Everlasting, ever new. Dream of Life. Dream Of Life."

everybody wants to rule the world,"Welcome to your life. There´s no turning back. Even while we sleep. We will find you. Acting on your best behaviour. Turn your back on mother nature. Everybody wants to rule the world. It´s my own design. It´s my own remorse. Help me to decide. Help me make the most of. Freedom and of pleasure. Nothing ever lasts forever. Everybody wants to rule the world. There´s a room where the light won´t find you. Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down. When they do i´ll be right behind you. So glad we´ve almost made it. So sad they had to fade it. Everybody wants to rule the world. I can´t stand this indecision. Married with a lack of vision. Everybody wants to rule the. Say that you´ll never, never, never, never need it. One headline why believe it?. Everybody wants to rule the world. All for freedom and for pleasure. Nothing ever lasts forever. Everybody wants to rule the world"
farewell reel,"[this little song is for Fred: it's G, C, D, and D minor]. It's been a hard time. and when it rains. it rains on me. the sky just opens. and when it rains. it pours. I walk alone. assaulted it seems. by tears from heaven. and darling I can't help. thinking those tears are yours. Our wild love came from above. and wilder still. is the wind that howls. like a voice that knows it's gone. cause darling you died. and well I cried. but I'll get by. salute our love. and send you a smile. and move on. So darling farewell. all will be well. and then all will be fine. the children will rise. strong and happy be sure. cause your love flows. and the corn still grows. and God only knows. we're only given. as much as the heart can endure. But I don't know why. but when it rains. it rains on me. the sky just opens. and when it rains. it pours. But I look up. and a rainbow appears. like a smile from heaven. and darling I can't. help thinking that smile. is yours."
fire of unknown origin,"A fire of unknown origin took my baby away.. Fire of unknown origin took my baby away.. Swept her up and off my wavelength.. Swallowed her up like the ocean in a fire thick and gray.. Death comes sweeping thru the hallway like a ladies' dress.. Death comes riding down the hallway in its Sunday best.. Death comes driving; death comes creeping; death comes I can't do nothing.. Death goes, there must be something that remains.."

All that you desire. Rolls on ahead. Like a ship in a bottle. Held up to the sun. Sails ain't going nowhere. You can count every one. Until it crashes unto the earth. And simply slips away. You can hide in the open. Or just disappear. Ours is just a craving. And a twist of the wrist. Will undo the stopper. With abrupt tenderness. Die little sparrow. And awake. Singing. It all will come out fine. I've learned it line by line. One common wire. One silver thread. All that you desire. Rolls on ahead
gung ho,On a field of red one gold star. Raised above his head. Raised above his head. He was not like any other. He was just like any other. And the song they bled. Was a hymn to him. Awake my little one. The seed of revolution. Sewn in the sleeve. Of cloth humbly worn. Where others are adorned. Above the northern plain. The great birds fly. With great wings. Over the paddy fields. And the people kneel. And the men they toil. Yet not for their own. And the children are hungry. And the wheel groans. There before a grass hut. A young boy stood. His mother lay dead. His sisters cried for bread. And within his young heart. The seed of revolution sewn. In cloth humbly worn. While others are adorned. And he grew into a man. Not like any other. Just like any other. One small man. A beard the color of rice. A face the color of tea. Who shared the misery. Of other men in chains. With shackles on his feet. Escaped the guillotine. Who fought against. Colonialism imperialism. Who remained awake. While others slept. Who penned like Jefferson. Let independence ring. And the cart of justice turns. Slow and bitterly. And the people were crying. Plant that seed that seed. And they crawled on their bellies. Beneath the giant beast. And filled the carts with bodies. Where once had been their crops. And the great birds swarm. Spread their wings overhead. And his mother dead. And the typhoons and the rain. The jungles in flames. And the orange sun. None could be more beautiful. Than Vietnam. Nothing was more beautiful. Than Vietnam. And his heart stopped beating. And the wheel kept turning. And the words he bled. Were a hymn to them. I have served the whole people. I have served my whole country. And as I leave this world. May you suffer union. And my great affection. Limitless as sky. Filled with golden stars. The question is raised. Raised above his head. Was he of his word. Was he a good man. For his image fills the southern heart. With none but bitterness. And the people keep crying. And the men keep dying. And it's so beautiful. So beautiful. Give me one more turn. Give me one more turn. One more turn of the wheel. One more revolution. One more turn of the wheel

it takes time,"No equation. to explain the division of the senses. No sound to reflect. the radiance of time. In the beginningest dream. Halls of disorder. Where we are swept to encircle dawn. Strapped in a low car. Racing thru silence. Trumpeting bliss. You could kiss the world. goodbye. Standing outside the courthouse. in the rain. Seemed like a lost soul. from the chapel of dreams. With a handful of images. Faces of children. Phases of the moon. One little thing you get wrong. changes the dimensions. Streets, swept memory. Diffused and lost. Like a prayer in the sun. Sometimes you can't tell. whether you're waking up. or going to sleep. Spiralling. Unnumbered streets. All the games cannot be yours. All the sights, the treasures of the eye. Does the divided soul remain the same?. No equation to explain. Destiny's hand. Moved, by love. Drawn by the whispering shadows. Into the mathematics."

Come on people Oh my land. What be troubling Oh my land. What be troubling What be troubling. What be troubling you. We are love and the future We stand in the midst of fury and weariness.

Freedom ring Freedom ring. Jubilee Oh my land. Oh glad day Oh my land. Hear our cry Freedom ring. Oh glad day Oh my land. Jubilee Jubilee"

last call,"by Patti Smith. In a mansion high the young man stood. Ready to join his companions good. Outside the scent of magnolia blossoms. Down streets of gold the children were racing. Just another wandering soul. Adrift among the stars. Just another human heart. Led, led away. He put his shoes on and he laid down. Outside the clouds were swiftly gathering. He drained his cup and his stirred the mixture. And he closed his eyes as his conscience whispered. Just another wandering soul. Adrift among the stars. Just another human heart. Led, led away. Misgivings unspoken he joined his companions. His face covered over in a mansion high. Outside the children gazed in wonder. At the quickening sky then slowly disbanded. Thirty-nine wandering souls. Adrift among the stars. Thirty-nine human hearts. Led, led away. His burning skin cooled by angels. Swallowing sorrows excretion. It's all excretion. Felled by his hand of the mind of another man. Who makes the decisions. Lends no provisions for mere eternal rides. Learning of course every alien force. Even Christ yearns to be. To possess the skin. And bone the blood of man. Who tends the flock who breaks the bread. Who makes his own choices. Won't listen to voices. Accept no false teachers. False preachers, good deeders. With their hands out stretched. To be filled with your money. Your mind, your heart, your imagination. Sympathy, empathy. Acknowledge all man as fellow creation. But don't follow him"
libbie's song,"If it wasn't for your golden hair. I would not be belonely. If it wasn't for your golden hair. I would not be alone. If it wasn't for your piercing stare. I would not be belonely. If it wasn't for your piercing stare. I would not be alone. I would not waltz in a widow's line. What was yours would not be mine. If it wasn't for your golden hair. I would not be alone. You courted me with princely airs. Said you'd love me only. Kiss the ribbons in my hair. Said darling come and fly. Flower of the Calvary. You swept me off my saddle. Lifted me into your life. A soldier's wife was I. You marched proudly for the horn. I prayed for your swift return. I waited for you so forlorn. 'Ere to be alone. I longed for you, I longed to die. I was so belonely. The pillow's bare by my side. And yet I shall abide. For heaven has aset for me. Companion for eternity. So kiss the ribbons in my hair. Say darling come and fly. If it wasn't for your golden hair. I would not be alonely. If it wasn't for your golden hair"

In the palace there was wild reverie. And the look in your eyes. As I dropped veil after veil. Was drunken desire. The dove calls and God notes it all. The naked truth. Here is my veil the seventh and last. It will cost you. Lo and beholden. Why don't you give it up. Lo and beholden. Come on you know it's true. Lo and beholden. Oh I'm beholden to you. The royal word has passed. The prophet's head is all I ask. For beauty and the naked truth. It will cost you. Lo and beholden. Why don't you give it up. Lo and beholden. Come on you know it's true.

looking for you (i was),In the medieval night. 'Twas love's design. And the sky was open. like a Valentine. All the lacy lights. Where wishes fall. And like Shakespeare's child. I wished on them all. Ahh to be your destiny. was all that I pursued. I could see the sights. from the lofty heights. But my heart obscured the view. I was looking for you. Looking for you. What could I do. I was looking for you. Along the black river. The ambassador jewels. And you were reflected. in all that I saw. In the towers of gold. In the wheel and wing. Gripping my senses. like an ancient claim. Many is the time I knelt in the light. appealing to all that I know. Guide my eyes and steps. that I may find love true. Refrain. Come on darlin'. All that hearts desire. was written before us. In the medieval fire. It was love's design. In the glittering stars. Like Shakespeare's child. To be where you are. From the Portobello Road. To the Port of Marseilles. Where the dervish turns. Where the wild goats play. Looking for you.

When we were young. I knew you. Now you're gone. In a little Narcissus pool. Drawn by its spell. We saw ourselves. Raw excitable. I knew you. When we were young. I knew you. Now you're gone. We didn't know. The precariousness. Of our young powers. All the emptiness. Wild,wild hair. Sad,sad eyes. White shirt black tie. You were mine. You grabbed the ring. Of the carousel. Tangoing. From Heaven to Hell. I knew you"
memento mori,"The fans were whirlin'. Like the blades of a 'copter. Liftin' into the skies above some foreign land. Soaked with the bodies of so many friends.. Johnny waved. He was on his way home. He waved goodbye to his comrades in arms,. And all the twisted things he'd seen.. He waved goodbye. And the blades hit. Something. Maybe just fate, but the blades hit. The 'copter went up in flames. And johnny never went marchin' home. Johnny never went marchin' home. They took his name. And they carved it on a slab of marble. With several thousand other names. All the fallen idols. The apples of their mother's eye. Just another name. Meanwhile. Back on that burning shore. Johnny's comrades stood speechless. They looked with uh-uh-uh-uh disbelieving eyes. As those bits of metal and the embers. The embers of his eyes. Fanned out into the air. Black dust. Flames. Oh johnny! some day they'll make a movie about you. And in the making of that movie. Some mad apocalypse. It will become even stranger than the simple act. Just a boy going up up up. Just a boy going up. In flames in the smoke. Just another life. Just another breath. And who'll remember. Oh eternity now. As eternal as a sheet of marble. Eternal as a slab on a green hill. And your name. And all your fallen brothers. And all the ones not cut. All the ones remembered only in the hearts. A mother a father a brother a sister a lover a son a daughter. Shall not shall not fade shall not fade. Your ancestors salute you. And the gods of your ancestors salute you. Having having been formed by the minds of your ancestors. The gods of your ancestors salute you. Having been formed by your ancestors. The gods of your ancestors salute you. They draw you in they draw you through. They draw they draw you through that golden door. Mornin' boy [come on in boy]. We remember you. We conceived of you. We conceived of your breath. We conceived of the whole human race. And we conceived it to be a beautiful thing. Like a tulip bending in the wind. Sometimes it comes back to us. In the form of a handful of dust. Comes back in the form of a smitten child. Our raped daughters, ah the broken bones. Souls cleaved from hearts. They come back to us. And our hands are filled with their rotting tissues. But we turn not our backs. We press our lips. Into their cancer into the dust into the remains of each one. And that love is there and will greet you, will greet you. Mornin' boy [come on in boy]. It's eternal love. Well here, go ahead, run through that flame. Awww man, running through your mind. You took a cat, you took a life, you took it by the tail. And you swirled it around your head. And you thrashed it, you smashed the life out of it. And you knew that it would be your own. But you wanted to feel, you wanted to feel it die. Because you know you would feel your own. You would feel your own. But you're remembered!. You're remembered!. You're remembered dead!. You're remembered dead!. You're remembered dead!. We remember. We remember. We remember. Everything. Everything"

my blackean year,In my Blakean year I was so disposed. Toward a mission yet unclear Advancing pole by pole. Fortune breathed into my ear Mouthed a simple ode. One road is paved in gold One road is just a road. In my Blakean year Such a woeful schism. The pain of our existence Was not as I envisioned. Boots that trudged from track to track Worn down to the sole. One road is paved in gold One road is just a road. Boots that tramped from track to track Worn down to the sole. One road was paved in gold One road was just a road. In my Blakean year Temptation but a hiss. Just a shallow spear Robed in cowardice. Brace yourself for bitter flack For a life sublime. A labyrinth of riches Never shall unwind. The threads that bind the pilgrim's sack Are stitched into the Blakean back. So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear. For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year. So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear. For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year

nine,"Night a nine of diamonds. A woman lay and cries. At the sister of Mercy. On a Sabbath day. Night a nine of diamonds. As revealers commence. To shiver as she bore. In a babe, a radiance. Brave in constant motion. Wherein perfection brews. Darkness as his brother. Mischief as his moon. Summoning beneath. With his gypsy moves. Yearning as the foal. Shy and beautiful. Every card he drew. Had a different face. Lingering and lost. Unholy holy ghosts. I tend to play them all. He spoke with confidence. Another kind of strange. To shift in loneliness. He sought not for himself. The empire he would find. Save the golden womb. He enter in his mind. We will die a littler. The rogues whistling. Nine blue-eyed sailors. Tip their caps to him. As he passes through them. More vagabond than king. With diamonds on his sleeves. Like a harlequin"
one voice,"In the garden of consciousness. In fertile mind there lies the dormant seed. When blooming as charity. Conscience breathes a sigh of relief. The confessions of sleep. The awakening seed. Moved by love to serve. We celebrate all. Merit in life. Ah, the confessions of sleep. Unfolding peace. As we extend. According to need. And you will hear the call. All action great and small. Received joyfully. Heaven abounds. Let love resound. If he be mute. Give him a bell. If he be blind, an eye. It he be down, a hand. Lift up your voice. Lift up your voice. Lift up your voice. Give of your mind one mind. Give of your heart one heart. Give of your voice. One voice"

The people have the power. The people have the power. The people have the power. Vengeful aspects became suspect. and bending low as if to hear. and the armies ceased advancing. because the people had their ear. and the shepherds and the soldiers. lay beneath the stars. exchanging visions. and laying arms. to waste / in the dust. in the form of / shining valleys. where the pure air / recognized. and my senses / newly opened. I awakened / to the cry. Refrain. Where there were deserts. I saw fountains. like cream the waters rise. and we strolled there together. with none to laugh or criticize. and the leopard. and the lamb. lay together truly bound.

Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome.. Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,. lo I turned my neck toward home.. Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,. 'til you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light.. In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true.. I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You.. As I move thru seven levels. As I move upon the slate. As I declare to you. The number of my moves. As I speculate the eighth. Seeking love without exception. A light upon the swarm. Seeking love without exception. A saint in any form.."

somalia,by Patti Smith. I don't know why I feel this way today. The sky is blue the table is laid. The trees are heavy with yellow fruit. And in their shade children happily play. The pears have fallen to the ground. My child places one in my hand. The sun is warm upon my face. And I dream of a burning land. Mother of famine take this pear. Upon an arrow through the rings of time. This small fruit this golden prayer. May it pass from this hand to thine. If I were rain I'd rain on Somalia. If I were grain for Somalia I'd grow. If I were bread I would rise for Somalia. If I were a river for Somalia I'd flow. All the mothers will dream of thee. All the mothers bless thy empty hand. All the mothers will grieve for thee. All the sorrow a mother can stand. If we were rain we would rain on Somalia. If we were grain for Somalia we'd grow. If we were bread we would rise for Somalia. If we were a river for Somalia we'd flow.
soul kitchen,"Well, the clock says it's time to close now. I guess I'd better go now. I'd really like to stay here all night. The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes. Street lights share their hollow glow. Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise. Still one place to go. Still one place to go. Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen. Warm my mind near your gentle stove. Turn me out and I'll wander baby. Stumblin' in the neon groves. Well, your fingers weave quick minarets. Speak in secret alphabets. I light another cigarette. Learn to forget, learn to forget. Learn to forget, learn to forget. Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen. Warm my mind near your gentle stove. Turn me out and I'll wander baby. Stumblin' in the neon groves. Well the clock says it's time to close now. I know I have to go now. I really want to stay here. All night, all night, all night"

strange messengers,I looked upon the book of life. Tracing the lines of face after face. Looking down at their naked feet. Bound in chains bound in chains. Chains of leather chains of gold. We knew it was wrong but we looked away. And paraded them down the colonial streets. And that's how they became enslaved. They came across on the great ships. Mothers separated from their babes. Husbands stood on the auction block. Bound in chains bound in chains. Chains of leather chains of gold. Men knew it was wrong but they looked away. And led them to toil in fields of white. As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape. Oh the people I hear them calling. Am I not a man and a brother. Am I not a woman and a sister. History sends us such strange messengers. They come down through time. To embrace to enrage. And in their arms even stranger fruit. And they swing from the trees. With their vision in flames. Ropes of leather ropes of gold. Men knew it was wrong but they looked away. Messengers swinging from twisted rope. As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape. Oh the people I hear them calling. Am I not a man and a brother. Am I not a woman and a siste. r We will be heard we will be heard

summer cannibals,I was down in Georgia. nothing was as real. as the street beneath my feet. descending into air.

Eat the summer cannibals. eat eat eat. you eat the summer cannibals. eat eat eat.

tarkovsky (the second stop is jupiter),"The eternal sun runs to the mother. She smoothes his brow and bids him. Drink from her well of hammered mist. Come along sweet lad,fog rises from the ground. The falling soot is just the dust of a shivering gem. The black moon shines on a lake. White as a hand in the dark. She lifts the lamp to see his face. The silver ladle of his throat. The boy the beast and the butterfly. Thw sea is morgue,the needle and the gun. These things float in the blood that has no name. The telegragh poles are crosses on the line. Rusted pins not enough saviors to hang. She bless the road the noose of vine. And waits beneath the triangle. Formed by Mercury,an evening star. The fifth planet with its blistering sore. And the soaring eagle above and to the west. The boy the beast and the butterfly. She walks across a bridge of magpies. Her hollow tongue fills the brightness. With water and in the wink of an eye. One planet with a glittering womb. One white crow one diamond hed. Big as a world big as world. Don't forget how I played with you. She cries,and kissed away your tears. The white mouth of the sun smiles. On his beautiful tounge the seed of flight"
the boy in the bubble,"It was a slow day. And the sun was beating. On the soldiers by the side of the road. There was a bright light. A shattering of shop windows. The bomb in the baby carriage. Was wired to the radio. These are the days of miracle and wonder. This is the long distance call. The way the camera follows us in slo-mo. The way we look to us all. The way we look to a distant constellation. That's dying in a corner of the sky. These are the days of miracle and wonder. And don't cry baby, don't cry. Don't cry. It was a dry wind. And it swept across the desert. And it curled into the circle of birth. And the dead sand. Falling on the children. The mothers and the fathers. And the automatic earth. These are the days of miracle and wonder. This is the long distance call. The way the camera follows us in slo-mo. The way we look to us all. The way we look to a distant constellation. That's dying in a corner of the sky. These are the days of miracle and wonder. And don't cry baby, don't cry. Don't cry. It's a turn-around jump shot. It's everybody jump start. It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts. Medicine is magical and magical is art. The Boy in the Bubble. And the baby with the baboon heart. And I believe. These are the days of lasers in the jungle. Lasers in the jungle somewhere. Staccato signals of constant information. A loose affiliation of millionaires. And billionaires and baby. These are the days of miracle and wonder. This is the long distance call. The way the camera follows us in slo-mo. The way we look to us all. The way we look to a distant constellation. That's dying in a corner of the sky. These are the days of miracle and wonder. And don't cry baby, don't cry. Don't cry"
the jackson song,"Little blue dreamer go to sleep. Let's close our eyes and call the deep. slumbering land that just begins. When day is done and little dreamers spin. First take my hand now let it go. Little blue boy you're on your own. Little blue wings as those feet fly. Little blue shoes that walk across the sky. May your path be your own. But I'm with you. And each day you'll grow. He'll be there too. And someday when you go. We'll follow you. As you go, as you go. Little blue star that offers light. Little blue bird that offers flight. Little blue path where those feet fall. Little blue dreamer won't you dream it all. Refrain. And in your travels you will see. Warrior wings remember Daddy. And if a mama bird you see. Folding her wings will you remember me. As you go, as you go."

till victory,"Raise the sky.. We got to fly over the land, over the sea.. Fate unwinds and if we die, souls arise.. God, do not seize me please, till victory.. Take arms. Take aim. Be without shame. No one to bow to, to vow to, to blame.. Legions of light, virtuous flight. Ignite, excite.. And you will see us coming, V formation, through the sky.. Film survives. Eyes cry.. On the hill, hear us call through a realm of sound.. Oh, oh-oh. Down and down.. Down and round, oh, down and round.. Round and round, oh, round and round.. Rend the veil and we shall sail.. The nail, the grail: That's all behind thee.. In deed, in creed, the curve of our speed.. And we believe that we will raise the sky.. We got to fly over the land, over the sea.. Fate unwinds and if we die, souls arise.. God, do not seize me please, till victory.."

trespasses,Life is designed With unfinished lines. That another sings Each story unfolds. Like it was gold Upon a ragged wing. The bold and the fair Suffer their share. He whispered to his kin All of my debts. Left with regrets I'm sorry for everything. Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may. Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day. And she pinned back her hair Shouldered with care. The burdens that were his Mending the coat. That hung on the post In heart remembering. Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may. Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day. And her time was to come Called to her son. This your song to sing All of our debts. Wove with regrets Upon a golden string. And he found the old coat Hung on a post. Like a ragged wing And took as his own. The sewn and unsown Joyfully whistling
up there down there,"Up there. There's a ball of fire. Some call it the spirit. Some call it the sun. Its energies are not for hire. It serves man / It serves everyone. Down there where Jonah wails. in the healing water. in the ready depths. Twisting like silver swans. No line of death no boundaries. Up there. The eye is hollow / The eye is winking. The winds ablaze / Angels howling. The sphinx awakens / But what can she say. You'd be amazed. Down there. Your days are numbers. Nothing to fear. There will be trumpets. There will be silence. In the end the end. Will be here just here. Ahh the borders of heaven. Are zipped up tight tonight. The abstract streets. The lights like some switched on Mondrian. Cats like us are obsolete. Hey Man don't breathe on my feet. Thieves, poets we're inside out. And everybody's a soldier. Angels howl at those abstract lights. And the borders of heaven. Are zipped up tight tonight. Up there. There's a ball of fire. Some call it the spirit. Some call it the sun. Its energies are not for hire. It serves man / It serves everyone. The air we breathe. The flame of wisdom. The earth we grind. The beckoning sea. It's no mystery / Not sentimental. Ahh the equation / It's all elemental. The world is restless. Heaven in flux / Angels appear. From the bright storm. Out of the shadows. Up there, down there. But what can we say. Man's been forewarned. All communion is not holy. Even those that fall. They can prophet understanding. It's all for man / It's for everyone. It's up there, down there. Everywhere / Everywhere. Time for communion / Time for communion."

where duty calls,In a room in Lebanon. they silently slept. They were dreaming crazy dreams. in foreign alphabet. Lucky young boys. cross on the main. The driver was approaching. the American zone. The waving of hands. The tiniest train. They never dreamed. they'd never wake again. Voice of the Swarm. We follow we fall. Some kneel for priests. Some wail at walls. Flag on a match head. God or the law. And they'll all go together. Where duty calls. United children. Child of Iran. Parallel prayers. Baseball Koran. I'll protect Mama. I'll lie awake. I'll die for Allah. In a holy war. I'll be a ranger. I'll guard the streams. I'll be a soldier. A sleeping Marine. Refrain. In the heart of the ancient. Ali smiles. In the soul of the desert. the sun blooms.

Exploding dawn. and himself as well. Their eyes for his eyes. Their breath for his breath. All to his end. And a room in Lebanon. Dust of scenes. Erase and blend. May the blanket of Kings. Cover them and him. Forgive them Father. They know not what they do. From the vast portals. of their consciousness.

wicked messenger,"There was a wicked messenger. From Eli he did come. With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter. When questioned who had sent for him. He answered with his thumb. For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter. He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed. Oftentimes he could be seen returning. Until one day he just appeared. With a note in his hand which read. “The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning”. Oh, the leaves began to fallin'. And the seas began to part. And the people that confronted him were many. And he was told but these few words. Which opened up his heart. “If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any”"

I needed nobody. it was beautiful. it was beautiful. and if there's one thing. could do for you. you'd be a wing. in heaven blue. and if there's one thing. could do for you. you'd be a wing. in heaven blue. and if there's one thing. could do for you. you'd be a wing.
within you without you,"We were talking about the space between us all. And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion. Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away. We were talking about the love we all could share. When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love. With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew. Try to realise it's all within yourself. No one else can make you change. And to see you're really only very small. And life flows on within you and without you. We were talking about the love that's gone so cold. And the people who gain the world and lose their soul. They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?. When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find. Peace of mind is waiting there. And the time will come when you see we're all one. And life flows on within you and without you"
