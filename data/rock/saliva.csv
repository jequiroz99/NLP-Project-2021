call it something,"Emmy was a school gem,. And she shot the shit with the best of them,. And she used clean needles when she can,. And if that veins down use the other one.. Sanctified rich girl,. With her daddy's kisses,. And her mother's pearls,. And she played dumb, and played hard to get,. And it worked until they found her dead.. We all go down and hit the ground. (x4). Lezy was a teacher,. She had 30 kids and they were all a peach.. And then a spaceman came along,. Took her hard and led her home.. Came home drunk from town and he took his gun and he shot her down,. And the judge said he could not believe that a man would kill his family.. We all go down and hit the ground (x4),. (And you gotta call it something,. Cause it always end up nothing,. For you to see that times goes on.) (x2)."

There's a pain that is haunting me still, and I could never go back and rewind.. And I could never have peace or be still.. Somebody take this away, they took you far away from me.. So I could never find you.. They made me blind but I could see, the loaded gun from behind you.. The end of everything we knew, inside of me and inside you.. I miss the way we used to be.. When I was what would bring you through.. No Hard Feelings. By Ryuuku."

So now I’m finally goin down can I find my way back home now there’s no one else around. can I find my way back home. Will I ever see the light. Even though I’m fallin. Will there ever. be any peace for me. Even though I’m falling. Will there ever be any peace for me. Even though. I’m falling. Will there ever be any peace for me.. And I wanna take you down, but your soul cannot be found. It doesn’t matter much you. see cause your disease is killing me. And you know it's only right 'coz it feels like. paradise, I know nothing if for free 'coz your disease is killin me.. And I wanna take you down, but your soul cannot be found. It doesn’t matter much you. see cause your disease is killing me. And you know it's only right 'coz it feels like. paradise, I know nothing if for free 'coz your disease is killin me.."
