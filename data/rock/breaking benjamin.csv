the dark of you,"It must have been inside my head. I've lost the hope that I have lived. And now, at last, it comes to pass. We sleep, we dream, we have no less. Along the path we lost our way. It's all a game that I must play. And now the weak that fall. Return to ash, defeated after all. Fade away to the wicked world we left. And I become the dark of you. Say a prayer for the wounded heart within. As I become the dark of you. Let go, we know this kind of life. We live, we breathe, we die. They call me to the light. Forever lost inside. With every dream we find. We feed, we burn, we lie. The fall of humankind. The everlasting light. Fade away to the wicked world we left. And I become the dark of you. Say a prayer for the wounded heart within. As I become the dark of you. Let go. Save this selfish world. Let go. Save this selfish world. Let go. Save this selfish world. Let go.

home,"I've got a little red bow. And I bought it for you. 'Cause I know you're not fair. I don't get it, oh well. And you color my skin. And the colors don't blend. 'Cause I'm gonna get you. And your little dog too. There's a yellow brick road. That we follow back home. 'Cause I know you can't wait. Your belligerent hate. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. Like home. I've, got a southern belle too. And ruby red shoes. And a body of straw. Are you sick of it all?. There's a man made of tin. With an oil can grin. And I'm gonna get you. And your little dog too. There's a yellow brick road. That we follow back home. And I know you can't wait. Your belligerent hate. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's a little white porch. And you wanted it so. And you let me go down. To the end of the road. And the black and the white. A technicolorful life. Can I stand by your side?. We can make it alright. Like home. 'Cause I'm home. There's a little white porch. And you wanted it so. And you let me go down. To the end of the road. And the black and the white. A technicolorful life. Then another arrived. It's a cowardly lion. What I want from this world. What I wanna resolve. When I want you to stay. So I want you to wait. I don't wanna be bold. I don't wanna be cold. I don't wanna grow old. I don't wanna grow old"
hopeless,Here I lie forever. Sorrow still remains. Will the water pull me down and wash it all away. Come and take me over. Welcome to the game. Will the current drag me down and carry me away. Suddenly the light begins to fade. Hopeless. I'm falling down. Filthy. I can't wake up. I can not hold on. I will not let go. Worthless. It's over now. Guilty. There's no way out. I can not hold on. I will not let go. Silent I go under. I am not afraid. I can see the daylight shine. And slowly drift away. Safe to say it's over. Sink into the grave. There is nothing left inside. But I am wide awake. I can hear the devil call my name. Hopeless. I'm falling down. Filthy. I can't wake up. I can not hold on. I will not let go. Worthless. It's over now. Guilty. There's no way out. I can not hold on. I will not let go
i will not bow,"Fall. Now the dark begins to rise. Save your breath, it's far from over. Leave the lost and dead behind. Now's your chance to run for cover. I don't wanna change the world. I just wanna leave it colder. Light the fuse and burn it up. Take the path that leads to nowhere. All is lost again. But I'm not giving in. I will not bow. I will not break. I will shut the world away. I will not fall. I will not fade. I will take your breath away. Fall. Watch the end through dying eyes. Now the dark is taking over. Show me where forever dies. Take the fall and run to Heaven. All is lost again. But I'm not giving in. I will not bow. I will not break. I will shut the world away. I will not fall. I will not fade. I will take your breath away. And I'll survive, paranoid. I have lost the will to change. And I'm not proud, cold-blooded fate. I will shut the world away. (Open your eyes). I will not bow. I will not break. I will shut the world away. I will not fall. I will not fade. I will take your breath away. And I'll survive; paranoid. I have lost the will to change. And I'm not proud, cold-blooded fate. I will shut the world away"

inertia,"I feel you coming slow,. It seems that's all you know.. You come around never lie,. You sense it's all in line.. Deadened by the way you overwhelm,. Saved by the ways.. Dead and bothered by the breaking down,. Leave you all I have.. You might shove me down,. You will never be alone.. You can lock me out,. You will never be alone.. You can shove me down,. You will never be alone.. I don't know what you think,. You chose the silent way.. You look around you see,. It's just like all I believe.. Bothered by the part we end,. You will never leave again.. I'm a better part of you,. Dead if I can't make it out.. You might shove me down,. You will never be alone.. You can lock me out,. You will never be alone.. You can shove me down,. You will never be alone.. Your fucking way!. Bothered by the part we end,. You will never leave again.. I'm a better part of you,. It's all upon the end.. You can shove me down,.

into the nothing,Screaming on the inside. I am frail and withered. Cover up the wounds. That I can't hide. Walls that lie between us. The saint within the sinner. I have lost the nerve. But it's all right. Carry the wounded and shut your eyes. All will be forgiven. None will rise. Bury the fallen and lead the blind. I will fight the loss. Dead inside. Into the nothing. Faded and weary. I won't leave and let you fall behind. Live for the dying. Heaven hear me. I know we can make it out alive. Leave me at the bottom. I am lost forever. Letters from the dead. Say goodbye. Sorrow falls upon us. This will be the last time. Days begin to end. But I'll get by. Follow the hopeless. And shut your eyes. All will be abandoned. None will shine. Gather the broken and leave this life. Lying in the earth. Side by side. Into the nothing. Faded and weary. I won't leave and let you fall behind. Live for the dying. Heaven hear me. I know we can make it out alive. I'll keep you inside. Where I lead you cannot follow. Straight into the light. As my breath grows still and shallow. Into the nothing. Faded and weary. I won't leave and let them fall behind. Live for the dying. Heaven hear me. I know we can make it out alive. Stay with me. You're all I have left. I know we can make it out alive. Stay with me. You're all I have left. I know we can make it out alive
ladybug,What did you say to me. I'm not a novelty. You're playing revelry. But no one's listening. I am a simple man. Without a simple plan. Let's make it easier. And just get out while we can. I'm the one you want. Hey Ladybug. You were always on the mind of everyone. Ladybug. You're pathetic and I've said it more than once. Ladybug. I believe you couldn't reach me where I am. Where my feet won't hit the ground. The time is passing by. You're my insecticide. The pressure's on the rise. I arrived well in time. Beautiful enemy. I'll fix your broken wings. And let you lie here until. You fly away from me. I'm the one you want. Hey Ladybug. You were always on the mind of everyone. Ladybug. You're pathetic and I've said it more than once. Ladybug. I believe you couldn't reach me where I am. Where my feet won't hit the ground. What did you say to me. I'm only here to clip your wings. You cut me down to size. I'm only living my life. Ladybug. You were always on the mind of everyone. Ladybug. You're pathetic and I've said it more than once. Ladybug. I believe you couldn't reach me where I am. Where my feet won't hit the ground. Where my feet won't hit the ground. Where my feet won't hit the ground. Where my feet won't hit the ground
lie to me,No named bars dead end stars. Empty roads to nowhere. Unlocked cars life's so far. There's no here to get there. As fast as I run. Could you catch me for once. It's the last time I learn my lesson the hard way. Because you lie. Because I just love to hate you. Because you lie to me. Cold and clean perfect dream. I don't ever want them. Hand me down white washed town. Another bully anthem. As fast as I run. Could you catch me for once. It's the last time I learn my lesson the hard way. Because you lie. Because I just love to hate you. Because you lie to me. You lie. You lie to me. You lie. You lie to me. You lie. You lie to me. As fast I run. Could you catch me for once. It's the last time I learn my lesson the hard way. Because you lie. Because I just love to hate. Because you lie to me. Because you lie. Because I just love to hate. Because you lie to me

After the lights go out on you. After your worthless life is through. I will remember how you scream. I can't afford to care. I can't afford to care. I am suffocating. You have failed to pull me in.

Feel the way that I do?. While I bend to your will. I've felatted myself. Tied to the needle. My drunk libido. Mind your own ego. The faster we go. You are an asshole. King of the castle. I am the meager. Follow the leader. Would you want to. Feel the way that I do?. While I bend to your will. I've felatted myself. And I know that you don't. Like the way that it goes. We're all in so begin. But just remember:. I win. . (fonte: site oficial)

When you're caught between the lines. Faith is forfeit. When the hollow fills our eyes. Hate lies hopeless. When the heart and soul divide. Pain is worthless. When the shadow comes alive. (Daylight falls). So save yourself. I leave this world tonight. There's nothing left. I see the sun rise. My dying breath. I keep this prayer alive. So save yourself. I leave this world tonight. There's nothing left. I see the sun rise. My dying breath. I keep this prayer alive

I am faded through. Hold on, hold on. The fallen arise. I will fight this war for you. And let the dawn of love survive. Broken, I crawl back to life. Is this the fate we fall between?. Deface the life inside of me. Drain the heart with atrophy. And take away the remedy. I am torn in two. Hold on, hold on. We're barely alive. I am faded through. Hold on, hold on. The fallen arise. I will fight this war for you. And let the dawn of love survive. Broken, I crawl back to life. Please hold on. I am torn in two. Hold on, hold on. We're barely alive. Please hold on. I am faded through. Hold on, hold on. The fallen arise. Please hold on. I will fight this war for you. And let the dawn of love survive. Broken, I crawl back to life. Hold on. Rise. Hold on. Rise. Hold on. Rise. Hold on"
tourniquet,Take this life. I will make you. I will start the pain within. I will crave you. I will learn to hate again. I will drain you. I will make you whole again. I will blame you. I will lay beside the dead. 'Cause I don't want to live inside this hell. Tame the fire from within. You won't break me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. I won't save you. I won't starve the hope within. I won't change you. I won't fight the pain within. I won't fail you. I won't let your light descend. I won't play you. I won't face your fate again. 'Cause I am born to live inside this hell. Tame the fire from within. You won't break me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. Tame the fire from within. You won't take me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. Let the calm rise up. So graceful. Every wasted word. So faithful. Tame the fire from within. You won't break me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. Tame the fire from within. You won't take me. Love will tie the tourniquet. And suffocate me. Suffocate me. Suffocate me
unknown soldier,"Borderline, dead inside.. I don't mind, falling to pieces.. Count me in, violent, let's begin.. Feeding the sickness.. How do I simplify, dislocate, the enemy is on the way.. Show me what it's like to dream in black and white,. So I can leave this world tonight.. Full of fear, ever clear.. I'll be here, fighting forever.. Curious, venemous, you'll find me, climbing to heaven.. Nevermind, turn back time.. You'll be fine, I will get left behind.. Show me what it's like to dream in black and white,. So I can leave this world tonight.. Holding on too tight.. Breathe the breath of life,. So I can leave this world behind.. It only hurts just once.. They're only broken bones.. Hide the hate inside.. Show me what it's like to dream in black and white,. So I can leave this world tonight.. Holding on too tight.. Breathe the breath of life,. So I can leave this world behind."
until the end,"So clever, whatever, I'm done with these endeavors.. Alone I walk the winding way (here I stay).. It's over, no longer, I feel it growing stronger.. I'll live to die another day, until I fade away.. Why give up, why give in?. It's not enough, it never is.. So I will go on until the end.. We've become desolate.. It's not enough, it never is.. So I will go on until the end.. Surround me, it's easy to fall apart completely.. I feel you creeping up again (in my head).. It's over, no longer,. I feel it growing colder.. I knew this day would come to end. so let this life begin.. Why give up, why give in?. It's not enough, it never is. So I will go on until the end.. We've become desolate.. It's not enough, it never is.. But I will go on until the end.. I've lost my way.. I've lost my way,. but I will go on until the end.. Living is hard enough without you fucking up. Why give up, why give in?. It's not enough, it never is.. So I will go on until the end.. We've become desolate.. It's not enough, it never is.. But I will go on until the end.. I've lost my way.. I've lost my way,. but I will go on until the end.. the final fight I win,. the final fight I win,. the final fight I win, but I will go on until the end"
water,"what's all this talk of a notion?. I'd rather drink from the ocean. what did you mean when you said no?. I only want what is best for you. but I won't ever let you drown. no I won't ever let you down. [chorus]. cause I am my enemy. the water's up to the knee. I never wanted anything from you. yes I do, yes I do. my engine's runnin' on time. my head's so fucked up inside. shut up. I know. I said so. there is no way to recover. you told me there is no other. the surface is getting hotter. I'll shove your head under water. but I won't ever let you drown. no I won't ever let you down. [chorus x 3]"
what lies beneath,Take a breath. Hold it in. Start a fight. You won't win. Had enough. Let's begin. Nevermind. I don't care. All in all. You're no good. You don't cry. Like you should. Let it go. If you could. When love dies in the end. So I'll find what lies beneath. Your sick twisted smile. As I lay underneath. Your cold jaded eyes. Now you turn the tide on me. 'Cause you're so unkind. I will always be here. For the rest of my life. Here we go. Does it hurt. Say goodbye. to this world. I will not. Be undone. Come to life. It gets worse. All in all. You're no good. You don't cry. Like you should. I'll be gone. when you fall. Your sad life. Says it all. So I'll find what lies beneath. Your sick twisted smile. As I lay underneath. Your cold jaded eyes. Now you turn the tide on me. 'Cause you're so unkind. I will always be here. For the rest of my life. Don't carry me under. You're the Devil in disguise. God sing for the hopeless. I'm the one you left behind. So I'll find what lies beneath. Your sick twisted smile. As I lay underneath. Your cold jaded eyes. Now you turn the tide on me. 'Cause you're so unkind. I will always be here. For the rest of my life
who wants to live forever,There's no time for us. There's no place for us. What is this thing that builds our dreams. And slips away from us?. Who wants to live forever?. Who wants to live forever. There's no chance for us. It's all decided for us. This world has only one sweet moment. Set aside for us. Who wants to live forever?. Who dares to love forever?. When love must die?. Oh! Touch my tears with your lips. Touch my world with your fingertips. And we can have forever. And we can love forever. Forever is ours today. Who wants to live forever?. Who wants to live forever?. Who waits forever anyway?
wish i may,"Shove me under you again. I can't wait for this to end. Sober, empty in the head. I know i can never win. Why should i have to wait?. I'll just look the other way. We left this land of shiny lights. I wish i may. I wish i might. When all these dreams have come to end. You wish you were, you're not my friend. I can see you suffocate. I can find no other way. Try to make you saturate. I can be your enemy. Why should i have to wait?. I'll just look the other way. We left this land of shiny lights. I wish i may. I wish i might. When all these dreams have come to end. You wish you were, you're not my friend"
without you,"Search for the answers I knew all along. I lost myself, we all fall down. never the wiser of what I've become. alone I stand a broken man. all I have is one last chance. I won`t turn my back on you. take my hand drag me down. If you fall then I will too. and I can't save what's left of you. sing something new. I have nothing left. I can't face the dark without you. there's nothing left to lose. the fighting never ends. I can't face the dark without you. follow me under and pull me apart. I understand there's nothing left. pain so familiar and close to the heart. no more, no last I won`t forget. come back down save yourself. I can't find my way to you. and I can't bare and face the truth. sing something new. I have nothing left. I can't face the dark without you. there's nothing left to lose. the fighting never ends. I can't face the dark without you. I wanted to forget. I'm trying to forget. don`t leave me here again. I'm with you forever, the end. sing something new. I have nothing left. I can't face the dark without you. there's nothing left to lose. the fighting never ends. I can't face the dark without you. holding the hand that holds me down. I forgive, forget you, the end. holding the hand that holds me down. I forgive you,forget you, the end"
you,My hands are broken and time is going on and on. It goes forever (how long). So I got high and lived all that life. I have taken all for granted. [Chorus]. Promise me you'll try to leave it all behind. 'Cause I've elected hell. Lying to myself. Why have I gone blind ?. Live another life. You. The only way out is letting your guard down. And never die forgotten (I know). Forgive me my love. I stand here all alone and I can see the bottom. (Repeat Chorus)
you fight me,"You fight me, flat on my lonely face I fell. Finding in the end, all is well. In light of the life that. I have found, it's coming down. I know it isn't real, but it's easy to beat me. Life is sink or swim.. Love is blinding, no surviving. I don't know what a world to be at. I can show that I need to see this.. No time for lies and empty fights. I'm on your side.. Can we live a life of peace and happiness?. I don't think so.. Looking, I am scared to lose the things I love.. I'm in control.. [Chorus]. This is how, this is how it's going to end.. Everyone is waiting here for everyone. Leave me alone.. [Chorus]. This is how, this is how it's going to end"
