She stood right there and then made it clear that it was me she wanted. What else could I do but stay away and hide?. Another night in the elephant booth, another night in the midget-van. Another sleepless night caused by something sticky coming up my face. There she was smiling at me. The Bearded Lady is chasing me. The Bearded Lady is chasing me. The Bearded Lady is chasing me. The Bearded Lady is chasing me. I ran away as fast as I could. Gotta get me another place to hide. I know that I should, and I keep running til the break of dawn. And I gotta keep running cause I know the hunt is on. The Bearded Lady is chasing me. The Bearded Lady is chasing me. The Bearded Lady is chasing me. The Bearded Lady is chasing me."

blood red moon,Through the thick of the woods and the shimmering glare. The moon up above lights up the air. What the blood red moon brings. it should come as no surprise. To a place with a meaning only few understand. The gathering six holding each other's hands. The willow it sings as to offer its advice. One can't stand without the other. And either will not run. The war can't be avoided but it can be won. Under the blood red moon. The blood red moon. Under the blood red moon. The blood red moon. Under the blood red moon. I can sit and watch bad history unfold. I control my own destiny I break up the mold. So what if I'm a witch shouldn't come as a surprise. Through the valley of fear I walk each day. But a circle of six now shows me the way. And now I climb mountains wherever they may rise. But I can't stand without you others. and you are nothing without me. We've been ready all our lives. to set the power free. Under the blood red moon. The blood red moon. Under the blood red moon. The blood red moon. Ooh under the blood red moon. But I can't stand without you others. and you are nothing without me. We've been ready all our lives. to set the power free. Under the blood red moon. The blood red moon. Under the blood red moon.

how will i cope with that?,The light is getting better as the sun is going up. It looks to be proceeding not knowing where to stop. Barely awake I get out of bed. I've been thinking quite a lot about what you said. You said I feel like I am stuck so I'm leaving today. I'm taking my things don't you follow me. So you satisfy yourself and lay me back. Back upon the shelf. So you took what you owned and a whole lot more. And I'm eating my breakfast right off the floor. Cause I've got no plates no tables no nothing. I know you're angry but you could have left something. Now I stand alone again but I wish it wasn't so. I wish you were here in my atmophere but I know you're not. I'm missing you so. How will I cope with that?. How will I ever cope with that?. Did I love you wrong I'm such a mess. Was my love too strong then I'll love you less?. I'll do almost anything to get you back. And I'll take whoever tries to plug your jack. But that's not easy when you're not here. I wish I could flick a switch and you would appear. Cause I'd like to gain some of your sympathy. The only thing I've won is the pain you're causing me. So now what am I gonna do. I loom about still missing you. Can't seem to find no where to go. Can't seem to learn what I want to know. Though I shouldn't let it get to me. It bothers me that you went away. Was I too thin? Was I too fat?. Now you're gone and how will I cope with that?. How will I cope with that?. How will I ever cope with that?.

you got it all... wrong,"You wanna dance, you really wanna let it go. You want it bad, but your style is I told you no. You want it. You do it fast when you really should do it slow. You got it bad, but this time I told you no. You're on it. Hey, it's true. But I wanna know. What you had or you did. So just let it go. You wanna laugh, and you really wanna let him know. You're so relaxed and you really wanna let it show. You want it. You really got where we worked through all the time. But you chose your way and I chose mine. You're on it. Hey, it's true. But I wanna know. What you had or you did. So just let it go. Oh no!. Remote control but you got it all. Oh no!. Stand ten feet tall 'cause you got it all. Oh no!. Remote control but you got it all. You've got it all. But you got it all wrong!. We had a laugh but it turned into a don't. We had a line but now I wanna get out. You're on it. I was scared when I made love to you. I put a lid on it and thought, that's it, I'm through!. You're on it. Hey, it's true. But I wanna know. What you had or you did. So just let it go. Oh no!. Remote control but you got it all. Oh no!.

you think you're so darn special,"Frances she lost forty ponds, so what about me?. Well I don't know much about anything. But I know I've got to pay. They never feed me, never let me watch T-V. They'r gonna wish they never fucked with me. Spotlight pointed in my face, what's going on?. They're about to punish me for something all of us would have done. I managed to escape, but I wasn't gone for long. They're holding me down, twisting my arm saying ""You'r the one to blame"". Still I haven't got a clue what's really on my mind. If you just got off my back the truth will be easier to find. How can I say that it was I? how can I say that it was I who broke the chain+. So what's with me? i'm such a mess. Mr Twistmyarm is forcing me to confess. Don't know what's come over me, don't know what popped out. But I think I'm beginning to sense what this is really all about. They're looking for someone like me. For someone to blame, to take a fall, to take a dive. For someone they can frame. Still I haven't got a clue what's really on my mind. If you just got off my back the truth will be easier to find."
