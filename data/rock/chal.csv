country view,Yeah I'm here and above me couldn't be a better scene. This blue bright sky. Far away from the city war it's false dreams. and it's cars I can feel. A nice deep breath. It's a kind of meeting with my own self and my visions. of this world been torn apart. Am I looking at you or looking at this country view?. 'Cause I think I can see your face now. I've been searching for you on my heart in every way. and everyhow. I've been looking for a trace of your lessons. in this place in this ground. At this moment I sense pleasure and begin to. understand how you look how you care. Am I looking at you or looking at this country view?. 'Cause I think I can see your face now. Am I looking at you or looking at this country view?. 'Cause I think I can see your face now. Show me the way?
the sign,"Once when I was a little boy child. They taught me not to tell. There was a secret. About a future in a hell. I brought a sign in my young mind. It was a little five point star. You can see it. On a helmet in a war. I can? t tell the future on these days. There is a machine. It? s terribly jammed. If this guitar, could help a little, a little. But it got stuck. At the mighty power trigger. Give me back my woman. Give me back my home. Give me back my sided silent soul. Now I see their job. They don? t want peace or love. But are seeking for miles of mines of gold. Next to the oil there is a fairy. She came here and spoke. That her friends elves. Are setting a meal for these robots. I can? t tell the future on these days. There is a machine. It? s terribly jammed. If this guitar, could help a little, a little. But it got stuck. At the mighty power trigger. Give me back my woman. Give me back my home. Give me back my sided silent soul"

under this tree,"You know here in this place. Used to live my spirit. Hello my friend. So much I miss you. I think I'm dreaming. I lay my body down. Feel the cool breeze. Shades are all around. And there's no heating. My heart is filled with love. Can sense there's no pain when you. Under this tree. These are comfortable days. On your knees. As your leaves brush over my hair. I sense that I can be free. My heart is filled with love. Can sense there1s no pain. May I, may I write you a song?. 'Cause there's no other way to atone for what I feel. Under this tree?"
whisper's gone,"Whisper's gone and now I'm going out. Maybe you've done what you supposed to have. Crazy boy go see what's going on there. Find it out, don't even look back. And I mean it. There were too many enemies on my back. But I don't care if I gonna have them shaken firmly. Save your soul don't try to put me on that. That game you started with my hand. And I mean it. Yeah. Take it on don't give them peace. After all is just like this. If you don't kill you will get killed. Take it on, don't give them peace"
