Did you enjoyed the feeling?. Did you enjoyed the feeling?. Cause everything you did was nothing.. And all you need is to be happy.. And life goes on. You seem so proud of me for nothing.. Why did not you accept everything you wanted?. And life goes on. We have to change this reality.. Because people are falling with gravity. Because life goes. And down. I'm tired of all this shit.
