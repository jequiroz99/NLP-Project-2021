down under,"Travelling in a fried-out Kombi. On a hippie trail, head full of zombie. I met a strange lady, she made me nervous. She took me in and gave me breakfast. And she said,.

With a slack jaw, and not much to say. I said to the man, ""Are you trying to tempt me. Because I come from the land of plenty?"". And he said,. ""Oh!

overkill,"I can't get to sleep. I think about the implications. Of diving in too deep. And possibly the complications. Especially at night. I worry over situations. I know will be alright. Perhaps its just my imagination. Day after day it reappears. Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear. Ghosts appear and fade away. Alone between the sheets. Only brings the exasperation. It's time to walk the streets. Smell the desperation. At least there's pretty lights. And though there's little variation. It nullifies the night. From overkill. Day after day it reappears. Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear. Ghosts appear and fade away. Come back another day. I can't get to sleep. I think about the implications. Of diving in too deep. And possibly the complications. Especially at night. I worry over situations. I know will be alright. It's just overkill. Day after day it reappears. Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear. Ghosts appear and fade away. Ghosts appear and fade away. Ghosts appear and fade away"

But patient hearts cannot match times steady tread. Is this the threshold of a fantasy?. Is there still life at all?. Loving you could have been, oh so easy. But there is something you don't understand. Through the times when two were one completely. There was another in this well laid plan. Best laid plan of ours. Watering the garden, some comfort for the twilight years. Still, life never lingers, it marches past our veil of tears. A moment's all we've got, to have and to hold. Don't slip, don't blink, don't turn your head. With a photographic memory. I could live in a time that used to be. Is this the threshold of a fantasy?. Is there still life at all?. Loving you could have been, oh so easy. But there is something you don't understand. Through the times when I was won completely. There was another in this well laid plan. Loving you could have been, oh so easy. But there is something you don't understand. There was a time when I was won completely. Our emotions they got out of hand."

And so it follows. Trying to find strength of purpose. I place temptation out of reach. Then search in every niche. Until I find you. I won't give up. Don't talk of giving up. I won't give it up--Love this world. No thoughts of giving up oh no no no no no. Perhaps its only saints who suffer. For those needs to which we're slaved. This road I walk is paved with good intentions. The final choice hangs on a wire. And there's no room for feet to stray. The piper waits for pay. And still I find you. I won't give up. Don't talk of giving up. I won't give up--Love this world. No thoughts of giving up oh no no no no no. I won't give it up--Love this world. Don't talk of giving up. I won't give it up--Love this world. No thoughts on giving up

With a slack jaw, and not much to say. I said to the man, ""Are you trying to tempt me. Because I come from the land of plenty?"". And he said,. ""Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah). Where women glow and men plunder?. Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?. You'd better run, you'd better take cover."""

I won't give it up--Love this world. No thoughts of giving up oh no no no no no. Perhaps its only saints who suffer. For those needs to which we're slaved.

I used to look at your school photographs. But I don't have them anymore. I wonder who's in my old college rooms. Or stuck on my old locker door. I dream of the ships at sea, on a stormy night. I wish that it was me, but I wake in fright. I realize, I can see it in your eyes. I've only got myself to blame. Winter kisses when your lips were blue. Like chasing wild geese in the snow. Pressing faces on the window panes. But that's a long long time ago. We go to a restaurant. You say it's love you want. I realize, I can see it in your eyes. You're moving on to something more."

No release always the same. Cut off my legs. Torture and maim. I'm back here again. Like a man who has two hearts. One day they fell apart. Both of them played their part you know. Can there be peace. Between the heart and the brain. No release to try is in vain. Stories repeat always the same. I won't come here again.
