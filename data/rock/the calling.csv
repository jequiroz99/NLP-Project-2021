wherever you will go,"So lately, been wondering. Who will be there to take my place. When I'm gone, you'll need love. To light the shadows on your face. If a great wave shall fall. And fall upon us all. Then between the sand and stone. Could you make it on your own. If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. And maybe, I'll find out. A way to make it back someday. To watch you, to guide you. Through the darkest of your days. If a great wave shall fall. And fall upon us all. Then I hope there's someone out there. Who can bring me back to you. If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. Run away with my heart. Run away with my hope. Run away with my love. I know now, just quite how. My life and love might still go on. In your heart, in your mind. I'll stay with you for all of time. If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. If I could turn back time. I'll go wherever you will go. If I could make you mine. I'll go wherever you will go. I'll go wherever you will go"
anything,"I'll be there. Always waiting. Waiting for you. To let me inside. Where your fire burns. In a city of angels. Just like a river rushing straight into the sea.

I'm watching you dream. Well are you dreaming of me?. So why can't you see. You're all that matters. You know if this earth should crack. I'll be your solid ground. I will be there to catch you when you fall down. [CHORUS]. If I have to crawl. Get down on my knees. Whatever it takes, I'll do anything. I'd take the stars right out of the sky for you. I'd end the world give you the sun, the moon. For all of time, forever loving you. Whatever you need. Whatever it takes, I'll do anything. If I have to crawl. Get down on my knees. Whatever it takes, I'll do anything"
stigmatized,"If I give up on you I give up on me. If we fight what's true,. will we ever be. Even if God himself and the faith I knew. Shouldn't hold me back,. shouldn't keep me from you. Tease me, by holding out your hand. Then leave me, or take me as I am. And live our lives, stigmatized. I can feel the blood rushing. through my veins. When I hear your voice, driving me insane. Hour after hour day after day. Every lonely night that I sit and pray. We live our lives on different sides,. But we keep together you and I. Just live our lives, stigmatized. We'll live our lives,. we'll take the punches everyday. We'll live our lives,. I know we're gonna find our way. I believe in you. Even if noone understands.

things don't always turn out that way,"Well he can't sleep at night. And he can't do what's right. It was all because she came into his life. It's a deep obsession, taking up his time. Chorus:. She's all that he wants, she's all that he needs. She's everything he just won't believe. Take away his doubt, turn him inside out. Then she can see what he's been dying to say. But things don't always turn out that way. And he must confess. All the impure thoughts of his beautiful temptress. Although he keeps it all bottled up inside. Although he keeps it all safe within his mind, oh yeah. Chorus. So wipe that smile off your face. Before it gets too late. There's only so much time. For you to make up your mind. Chorus."
could it be any harder,"Fade away, fade away.... Fade away, fade away.... You left me with goodbye and open arms. A cut so deep I don't deserve. You were always invincible in my eyes.

Could you taste me when you licked his skin?. And all that while I showered you with trust and promises. What I'm needing now is a sweet revenge. To get back all that I lost then. I gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you. Chorus:. Adrienne, I thought I knew you. Once again, you used me, used me. Adrienne, I should have left you.

If we had a moment to ourselves. If we had this night together, then we'd be unstoppable. Do you think that this is right, or is it really wrong. I know that this is what we've been wanting. And all this burning in my soul, it fills up to my throat. It fills up 'till my heart is breaking. Chorus. Now, we can both learn. Somehow, you'll see it's all we have. Love, it keeps us together.

And when you sleep, I'll be there. To kiss your lips, to breathe your air. Right or wrong, it must go on. After this night, we'll leave it all behind. Two hearts beat as one. As I open my eyes. Well do you want me to keep going?. Cause I have already come all undone.... [CHORUS]. Now she's calling. And it hurts me to go. Away from my favourite addiction. There's no way that she'll ever know.... We'll go surrendering to our lives. When you sleep, I'll be there. To kiss your lips, to breathe your air. Right or wrong, it can't go on. After this night, we'll leave it all behind. But I'm still feeling. Drawn to you. In my dreams. So it seems. The man in me always. Gets his way. Never pays. For what he's done. I need you now love, love, love. I crave you now love, love, love"

if only,"What's the way of love?. Tell Me your fiction. Tell me your lies. Say to me now, you'll never forget this night. I'm feeling emotionless. My head's so clear. My enemies aren't, the ones I fear. You know your kiss confuses. This troubling soul. And I found out. That we're all breaking hearts. That we're all broken hearts. [CHORUS:]. If only love could find us all. If only hearts didn't have to fall. We can't mislead to make things right. So instead we'll sleep alone tonight. What's the way of love?. You are thinking I'm crazy. But you're blushing of lust. I've heard a lot of nice things,. but tell me which ones I'm to trust?. These walls we made are glass. And they have been known to crack. But until then. You'll keep pushing my way. And I'll keep pushing you away. [CHORUS]. If you want to take a chance. And try to make things right. You'd better have a reason to be loved. We all want something more. And it is worth fighting for.... [CHORUS]. And if somehow fate were in my hands. Would it be enough to understand. Why we feel lost in a world so small. If only love could find us all..."

And I can see that nothing's changed at all. Though we falter, we don't have to fall. And I can see that nothing's changed at all. Even when I was young. And the pressure was on. You always told me to do my thing. So what the hell went wrong. Chorus. And I remember, and I recall. And I can see that nothing's changed at all. Though we falter, we don't have to fall. And I can see that nothing's changed at all. An outcast coming home, opinions stay the same. They'll spit them out and spin me right back through the door. The louder that we scream, the more invisible we seem. Is it gonna last forever. Now I'm learning the lies. From the skies where they reign. Can't find shelter for myself. And you're all to blame. Chorus. And I remember, and I recall. And I can see that nothing's changed at all. Though we falter, we don't have to fall. And I can see that nothing's changed at all"

through the rain,"Through The Rain. by Mariah Carey E Lionel Cole. 01. Through The Rain. When you get caught in the rain. With nowhere to run. When you’re distraught. And in pain without anyone. When you keep crying out to be saved. But nobody comes. And you feel so far away. That you just can’t find your way home. You can get there alone, it’s ok. Once you say. I can make it through the rain. I can stand up once again. On my own and I know. That I’m strong enough to mend. And every time I feel afraid. I hold tighter to my faith. And I live one more day. And I make it through the rain. (Vocal improvisation). And if you keep falling down. Don’t you dare give in. You will arise safe and sound. So keep pressing on steadfastly. And you’ll find what you need to prevail. Once you say. I can make it through the rain. I can stand up once again. On my own and I know. That I’m strong enough to mend. And every time I feel afraid. I hold tighter to my faith. And I live one more day. And I make it through the rain. And when the wind blows. And shadows grow close. Don’t be afraid. There’s nothing you can’t face. And should they tell you. You’ll never pull through. Don’t hesitate. Stand tall and say. I can make it through the rain. I can stand up once again. On my own and I know. That I’m strong enough to mend. And every time I feel afraid. I hold tighter to my faith. And I live one more day. And I make it through the rain. I can make it through the rain. Can stand up once again. And I'll live one more day, and I. I can make it through the rain. Oh yes you can. You’re gonna make it through the rain."

unstoppable,"Come and lay right on my bed, sit and drink some wine. I'll try not to make you cry. And if you get inside my head, then you'd understand. Then you'd understand me. Why I've felt so alone, why I kept myself from love. And you became my favorite drug. So let me take you right now and swallow you down,. I need you inside. Chorus:. If we had this night together. If we had a moment to ourselves. If we had this night together, then we'd be unstoppable. Do you think that this is right, or is it really wrong. I know that this is what we've been wanting. And all this burning in my soul, it fills up to my throat. It fills up 'till my heart is breaking. Chorus. Now, we can both learn. Somehow, you'll see it's all we have. Love, it keeps us together. And I need love. When I wake up without you, knowing you're not there. I'm only feeling half as good. Well I'm gonna find a way. To wrap you in my arms, you make me feel alive. Chorus (x2)."
we're forgiven,"Well I would like to think. The world hasn't seen. That all the best is still to come,. And I know life ain't easy. I pass them sleeping on the streets. Their bloodstained hands and dirty feet. And I can't ignore them. Any more than I already have. Chorus:. So we laugh, and we smile. And we play our games of sweet denial. But don't tell me we're forgiven. If we hold, all our breath. If we kneel right down and just repent. You can't tell me we're forgiven. Start with me, I cannot lie. When my heart doesn't follow my eyes. Turn away, from all the suffering. That surrounds. Our time on this earth. For some their life has been a curse. I say I'm sorry and I should change. You know it just could be me someday. Chorus. So we laugh, and we smile. And we play our games of sweet denial. But don't tell me we're forgiven. If we hold, all our breath. If we kneel right down and just repent. You can't tell me we're forgiven. There's no way outta here. I don't wanna die, and leave it all behind. Each day a part of me disappears. But who am I to judge, what's been sent from above?. Chorus. We can't laugh, we can't smile. When so much just ain't right. It can't go on forever. If we hold, our breath. If we kneel right down and repent,. You can't tell me we're forgiven, no,. You can't tell me we're forgiven"
when it all falls down,"Heaven's in your eyes. And its beggin me to lie. Waiting for a little more of those words you wanna hear but. The silence weighs on me. And I think it's time to leave. Before I go, you gotta know why nothing's ever clear. Said I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting to know you. But I dont even understand myself. So don't ask me why. You know I'll have to walk away. Don't you try to stop and save me. When it all falls down, when it all falls down. You know I've tried but I can't change. So go ahead and blame me. When it all falls down,. Cuz it'll all fall down. In the spider web, I'm tried by what I've said. Cuz you can see, I'll never be what you really want so. I'll just hide behind this attitude, dissolve my pride. It's made the choice to keep your voice from creeping to my inside. Said I'm waitin for you, I'm waitin to know you. Can't forgive if I won't let you help. What do you want from me?. You know I'll have to walk away. Don't you try to stop and save me. When it all falls down, when it all falls down. You know I've tried but I can't change. So go ahead and blame me. When it all falls down,. Cuz it'll all fall down. Even if I tried. Even if I lied to you. It wouldn't make it any better. Well now, even if I lose. The one that I would choose would be you. Said I'm waitin for you, and I'm waitin to know you. But I don't even understand myself. So don't ask me why, don't ask me why. You know I'll have to walk away. Don't you try to stop and save me. When it all falls down, when it all falls down. You know I've tried but I can't change. So go ahead and blame me. When it all falls down,. Cuz it'll all fall down. Oh, then oh, when it all falls down. When it all, when it all falls down"
wherever you will go,"So lately, been wondering. Who will be there to take my place. When I'm gone, you'll need love. To light the shadows on your face. If a great wave shall fall. And fall upon us all. Then between the sand and stone. Could you make it on your own. If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. And maybe, I'll find out. A way to make it back someday. To watch you, to guide you. Through the darkest of your days. If a great wave shall fall. And fall upon us all. Then I hope there's someone out there. Who can bring me back to you. If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. Run away with my heart. Run away with my hope. Run away with my love. I know now, just quite how. My life and love might still go on. In your heart, in your mind. I'll stay with you for all of time. If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. If I could turn back time. I'll go wherever you will go. If I could make you mine. I'll go wherever you will go. I'll go wherever you will go"
why don't you and i,Since the moment I spotted you. I walk round with little wings on my shoes. My stomach's filled with the butterflies.... And it's alright. Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud. I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down. If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied. Everytime I try to talk to you. I get tongue-tied. Turns out everything I say to you. Comes out wrong and never comes out right. Chorus:. So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together. And take on the world and be together forever. Heads we will and tails we'll try again. So I say why don't you and I hold each other. And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven. Cause without you they're never going to let me in. When's this fever going to break?. I think I've handled more than any man can take. I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around. And it's alright. Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud. I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down. If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied. Everytime I try to talk to you. I get tongue-tied. Turns out everything I say to you. Comes out wrong and never comes out right. Chorus:. So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together. And take on the world and be together forever. Heads we will and tails we'll try again. So I say why don't you and I hold each other. And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven. Cause without you they're never going to let me in. And slowly I begin to realize this is never going to end. Right about the same as you walk by. And I say 'oh here we go again'. Chorus:. So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together. And take on the world and be together forever. Heads we will and tails we'll try again. So I say why don't you and I hold each other. And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven. Cause without you they're never going to let me in
with or without you,"See the stone set in your eyes. See the thorn twist in your side. I wait for you. Sleight of hand and twist of fate. On a bed of nails she makes me wait. And I wait without you. With or without you. With or without you. Through the storm we reach the shore. You give it all but I want more. And I'm waiting for you. With or without you. With or without out you. I can't live. With or without you. And you give yourself away. And you give yourself away. And you give. and you give. And you give yourself away. My hands are tired. My body bruised, she's got me with. Nothing to win. and nothing else to lose. With or without you. With or without you. I can't live. With or without you"
you left it up to me,"You say I've all of late. You walk right through me. Walk, Talk, innocence. You left it up to me. Fly, violence. You wait on me yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All dressed up in time. Never knew you could do it. light, shade, seems all out of my dreams. In a way, in a way, in a way, in a way, in a way. There’s something wrong, being so right. When your soul doing time. When will I notice how you set me back ten years from now. When the lesson deepens you try. As I cross my heart and swear to die. Shy violence. To wait on me. When will I notice how you set me back ten years from now. When the lesson deepens you try. As I cross my heart and swear to die. I don't wanna be, ‘cause you left it up to me. You say I've all of late. You walk right through me. I Walk, talk this innocence. You left it up to me"
your hope,"When your hope is lost. When your hope is fading.... What would you do if you had. Just one little pill in your hand. That changed around all you could be. That helped you forget what you've seen. If all you ever wanted, was to let go.... (There are so many things that we just don't know about). [CHORUS:]. When your hope is lost and you can't take it. Now you've come too far, to let them break it. You think it would be all right. To live someone else's life. Trust what you already have. Cause once you fall in, you can't turn back. If all you ever wanted, was to let go.... (I think we all know what it's like to feel alone). [CHORUS]. You've got to throw those thoughts away. Before you make a big mistake. You've lost control, been thrown off track. But now it's time, to take it back, take it back. You have to want to. You have to want to.... (There are so many things). [CHORUS]. When your hope is lost. When your hope is fading. When your hope is lost..."
