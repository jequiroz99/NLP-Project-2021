born to battle,"I was born in warfare. If you cannot see. You just can't, you can't believe in me. I hate my neighbors. And they hate me. I'm gonna tell my tale. And you're gonna see. (Chorus). I was born to battle. You're gonna see. I was born to battle. You can believe in me. I was born to battle. You're gonna see. I was born to battle. Yes, I was born to battle. And my daddy said. My daddy said ""my son. Please never try, never try a gun"". And my mommy taught me. ""If you kill someone. Just make them bleed, and take no shit"""
embrace the darkside,"I've been living too long in darkness. Lost my path of destiny. I've drowned myself in madness. My friends become my enemies. And I can't find my own way out. Cause I'm still chained in the past. I can't breathe, I cannot shout. My next step shall be my last. (Chorus). As I embrace. Embrace the Darkside. Hostile armies rise against me. The Force grows inside of me. One by one they will be destroyed. The Dark Empire will prevail. And I can't find my own way out. Cause I'm still chained in the past. I can't breathe, I cannot shout. My next step shall be my last. (Chorus). Fear is the path to the Darkside. It leads you to anger, anger leads you to hate. Hate leads you to suffering. Embraced by the Darkside I have become. I still remain in the Darkside. Welcome to the Darkside"
final ride,"I'm a loaded gun. My own revenge. A blazing torch. Inside my veins. A razorblade, a death machine. My goddamn fate belongs to me. Revenge wish, blows up my brains. It's so strong as a hand grenade. The Rebel Son becomes the beast. My goddamn fate belongs to me. (Chorus). You can't bring me down. Don't try to take my pride. No one can stop me. This is my final ride. The hands of Doom over my head. Don't try to run, there's no escape. You're gonna beg, you're gonna scream. Your goddamn fate belongs to me. (Chorus). Accept your fate, believe in me. You're just paying for what you did. Here is your grave, you're already dead. Your goddamn fate belongs to me. (Chorus). Vengeance is mine!"
insanity,"Here I go again. Trying to face my reality. Here I go again. Trying to keep my sanity. (Chorus). Keep trying to escape. To deny my fate. Keep trying to escape. To deny my fate. Keep trying to escape. To deny my insanity. Here I go again. Trying to face my fucking sanity. Here I go again. Trying to release the spirits. (Chorus). I can't believe that I am here. The only thing I wanted was my liberty. I'm gonna fight, fight, fight against all. I can't believe that I am here. The only thing I had was my liberty. Oh no no no no Fuck! Oh my god no!. In this prison called mind. I'm gonna fight, I can deny. In this prison called mind. I can deny my insanity"
the raven,"Once upon a midnight shore. The Devil at my chamber door. Wraith shadows on the floor. Nothing is there and much more. Tapping at my chamber door. Nameless here for evermore. This is it and nothing more. Said the creature, Nevermore. Bird or beast? Oh my sweet Lord. Memories of my dear Lenore. Silence is louder than before. Cause she's rotten from the core. Tapping at my chamber door. Nameless here for evermore. This is it and nothing more. Said the Raven, Nevermore. And the Raven, never flitting. still is sitting, still is sitting. On the pallid bust of Pallas. just above my chamber door. And his eyes have all the seeming. of the demon that is dreaming. And the lamp-light o'er. him streaming throws his shadow on the floor. And my soul from out that shadow. that lies floating on the floor. Shall be lifted nevermore"
world at war,"Guns and bones own the world. Armies march to reap off our souls. Spilling blood around the land. For foolish reasons we die in vain. (Chorus). Chaos, death, blood. Guts, bones, pain, suffer. Chaos, death, blood. Power, money, greed. World at War!. The Reaper crawls the walls of law. Keep killing till the dawn. Meet the Mayhem and turn yourself in. Feel the scythe tearing your skin. (Chorus). Chaos, death, blood. Guts, bones, pain, suffer. Chaos, death, blood. Power, money, greed. World at War!. And it's time to down your knees. You can't escape from your destiny. Never forget what I say. Welcome to doomsday. (Chorus). Chaos, death, blood. Guts, bones, pain, suffer. Chaos, death, blood. Power, money, greed. World at War!"
