But I know that I could answer. Something better. This feeling won't go. Wait for it (x4)"

Out here, the bell don't ring. Out here, the bell don't ring. Out here, the good girls die. Now Cinderella, don't you go to sleep. It's such a bitter form of refuge.

Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind. (You laid it on the line). It was just a matter, it was a matter of time. We found ourselves a place. We belong in it forever.

Why aren't you shaking. Step back in time. Graciously taking. Oh you're too kind. And if the answer is no. Can I change your mind. We're all the same. And love is blind. The sun is gone. Before it shines. And I said if the answer is no. Can I change your mind"
christmas in la (feat. dawes),"Woke up, the sun streaming in my room. Warm beach from palm December afternoon. You close your eyes, another year blows by. Somewhere in the wind, just another life. My parents sent a Christmas card and then it's true. We understand you're staying and we're proud of you. There's a well-rehearsed disinterest in the atmosphere. I don't know if that's what this time gave me. Or if it lead me here. And I played so many parts. I don't know which one's really me. Don't know if I can take. Another Christmas in L. A. Another pitcher of Sangria. In an empty beach café. Another Christmas in L. A. Hold me tighter Carmelita. I don't know how long I can stay. Left a girl behind in my old man's truck. Sometimes I wonder where she ended up. Maybe she got married, had a couple of kids. Who do you think you're fooling man?. Of course she did. I'm walking in that tennis bar. Try and talk with Harry Bean. I don't know if I can take. Another Christmas in L. A. Another casting call on Thursday. For a job that doesn't pay. Another Christmas in L. A. Another burnout in a tank top. It seems your basket is the case. A fat protagonist in flip flops. With an extensive resume. From Echo Park to Catalina. Dreaming of a white Christmas. The one I used to know. Tree tops glisten, children listen. To sleigh bells in the snow. Another Christmas in L. A"
coming out,"She's got her halo and wings. Hidden under his eyes. But she's an angel for sure. She just can't stop telling lies. But it's too late for his love. Already caught in a trap. His angel's kiss was a joke. And she is not coming back. Because heaven sends and heaven takes. Crashing cars in his brain. Keep him tied up to a dream. And only she can set him free. And then he says to me. Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now. Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now. Yeah she's got a criminal mind. He's got a reason to pray. His life is under the gun. He's got to hold every day. Now he just wants to wake up. Yeah, just to prove it's a dream. Cause she's an angel for sure. But that remains to be seen. Because heaven sends and heaven takes. Crashing cars in his brain. Keep him tied up to a dream. And only she can set him free. And then he says to me. Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now. Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now. Stupid on the streets of London. James Dean in the rain. Without her it's not the same. The same, the same, but it's alright. Because heaven sends and heaven takes. Crashing cars in his brain. Keep him tied up to a dream. And only she can set him free. And then he says to me. Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now. Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now. Again and again"

flesh and bone,"I've gone through life white-knuckled. In the moments that left me behind. Refusing to heed the yield. I penetrate the forcefields and the blind. They say I'll adjust. God knows I must. But I'm not sure how. This natural selection. Picked me out to be. A dark horse running in a fantasy. Flesh and bone!. And I'm running out of time. Flesh and bone!. Somewhere outside that finish line. I square up and break through the chains. And I hit like a raging bull. Anointed by the blood. I take the reigns. Cut from the cloth. Of the flag that bears the name. Battle born. And they'll call me the contender. They'll listen for the bell. With my face flashing crimson. From the fires of hell. What are you afraid of?. And what are you made of?. Flesh and bone!. And I'm running out of time. Flesh and bone!. And what are you made of?. Flesh and bone!. And I'm turning on the dime. Flesh and bone!. This could decay (decay, decay, decay). This could decay. Like the valley below. Defences are down. Stakes are high. (Let's get out the crowd for a face of compassion). The fairytale end. (To face out the journey to force us no more). The staggering blow. (You'll find the truth in the roots of desire). You lead with your chin. (Sitting in your corner, just a compass and the sun). This could be real. Simple. And what are you made of?. Flesh and bone!. And I'm running out of time. Flesh and bone!. What are you made of?. He places forward. Trading his blindness.

The bells absolve him. And there's more starting and. We are the descendants. Of giant men"

four winds (cover),"Your class, your caste, your country, sect, your name or your tribe. There's people always dying, trying to keep 'em alive. His body's decomposing in containers tonight. In an abandoned building where. A squatter's made a mural of a Mexican girl. With fifteen cans of spray paint and a chemical swirl. She's standing in the ashes at the end of the world. Four winds blowing through her hair. But when great Satan's gone, the whore of Babylon. She just can't sustain the pressure where it's placed, she caves. The Bible's blind, the Torah's deaf, the Qu'ran's mute. If you burn them all together, you get close to the truth still. They are pouring over Sanskrit on the Ivy League moons. While shadows lengthen in the sun. Cast all the school and meditation built to soften the times. And hold us at the center while the spiral unwinds. It's knocking over fences, crossing property lines. Four winds, cry until it comes. And it's the sum of man, slouching towards Bethlehem. A heart just can't contain all of that empty space. It breaks, it breaks, it breaks. Well, I went back, I rent a Cadillac, a company jet. Like a newly orphaned refugee, retracing my steps. All the way to Cassadaga to commune with the dead. They said, ""You'd better look alive"". And I was off to old Dakota where a genocide sleeps. In the black hills, the bad lands, the calloused east. I buried my ballast, I made my peace. With four winds, leveling the pines. But when great Satan's gone, the whore of Babylon. She just can't remain with all that outer space. She breaks, she breaks, she caves, she caves"

heart of a girl,"Looking out my window an angel in robe appeared. And nearly pulled me apart. A million miles of freedom. A million miles of road. But I still don't know where to start. She wrote her number down. She gave it to me. They had to scrape me off the floor. In this transient town. Waiters and dealers trying to get their foot in the door. That night I called her, she said. Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life. I've been trying to find my place in the world. (I said to her). Baby, baby, babe I got all night. To listen to the heart of a girl. I can see the time dripping down the clock. We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain. It's the one that knows us when our heads are down. It reminds us of the place from where we came. Where we came. Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life. I've been trying to find my place in this world. Baby, baby, babe I got all night. To listen to the heart of a girl. What happened here? What is this world?. It's too far from the heart of a girl. Ripping the heart from the drop of a pearl. I'm on the shore waiting for the heart of a girl. Any door Knock on one. Standing still, time is raging. Staring down the mouth of 100,000 guns. You're still here, you're still here. I believe that we never have to be alone. Yes I believe it's just around the bend. You can hold it in, or you can scream it on the microphone. There is no end. There is no end. Deep in the night, I feel a presence. Of something that was long ago, told to me. There is a hand guiding the river. The river to wide open sea. And deep in my heart, in any game,. On any mountain, no I'm not afraid. Standing on stone, you stand beside me. And honor the plans that were made"
here with me,"Wheels are turning. I remember when you were mine. Just to reach you. Baby, I'd stand in line. There's another world. We're living in. Tonight. There's another heart. That's fading in.

Time seems to move so slowly. When you're taking it as it comes. (Taking it as it comes). Maybe we were just too young. (Maybe we were just too young). Your body was tan and your hair was long. You showed me your smile and my cares were gone. Falling in love filled my soul with fright. You said ""Come on babe, it'll be alright"". Must have been a fool till the bitter end. Now I hold on to hope. That I'll have you back again. I'd bargain and. I'd fight. But there's another world. You're living in. Tonight. Don't want your picture. On my cell phone. I want you here with me. I don't want your memory. In my head, no. I want you here with me. Well, I saw you in a restaurant. The other day. And instead of walking towards you. I ran away. (Ran away).

"joel, the lump of coal","Some time ago at Santa's place. Up in the old North pole. There lived a lump of anthracite. Whose parents called him Joel. Joel, Joel, the lump of coal. Happy as a lump can be. He just wants to keep Santa warm. And make the elves cosy. But Santa Claus had other plans. For Joel one fateful day. ""Joel, you're just the lump I need. Come join me on my sleigh"". Joel, Joel, the lump of coal. Heart leapt up with joy. ""I'll soon be Santa's present to. A lucky girl or boy. We'll laugh and play together. And we'll hold each other tight. Snuggle under clean white sheets. When we go to sleep at night"". Then Santa's elves all laughed at Joel. ""You're in for a surprise. You're not a special Christmas gift. You're just a booby prize. What kid would ever want you?. You're filthy as can be. And now you have to go and live. With one who's been naughty"". That made keep. Poor Joel crying in electricy. You pollute the air. With CO2 and Mercury. Joel, Joel, the lump of coal. Fell down upon his knees. ""I don't want to live with a naughty kid. Don't make me, Santa, please"". But Santa laughed his jolly laugh. ""Ho ho, you stupid lump. You're just the thing to teach this brat. That Santa ain't no chump, ho ho ho"". So off they flew and before he knew. Joel was in a sack. He cried and yelled to Santa Claus. ""Why don't we just go back? "". And then came Christmas morning. And much to Joel's surprise. He saw a boy with the saddest face. And tears were in his eyes. (Tears were in his eyes). He picked Joel up, he held him. He said ""You can be my friend"". (Be my next best friend). ""I would have liked some presents but. You're what Santa chose to send"". (Santa chose to send). ""It's true I've been a naughty boy. And maybe that's a sin"". (Maybe that's a sin). ""But if this is how Santa treats the kids. I'm just glad that I'm not him"". Joel, Joel, the lump of coal. Knew what he must do. He said ""Now I know the reason why. I got sent to you"". Because when a person hurts inside. It turns him hard and cruel. But I know how to make your pain. Into a precious jewel. So take me in your hand, young man. And squeeze with all your might. Let's turn your pain and anger into. Something that shines bright"". And Joel, Joel, the lump of coal. He gave his life away. So one good naughty little boy. Had a diamond on Christmas day"
"joseph, better you than me","Well your eyes just haven?t been the same, Joseph. Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph. There?s a pale moonshine above you. Do you see both sides, do they shove you around. Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph. Are the rumours eating you alive, Joseph. When the holy night is upon you. Will you do what?s right, the position is yours. From the temple walls to the New York night. Our decisions rest on a child. When she took her stand did she hold your hand. Will your faith stand still or run away. Run away. When they've driven you so far. That you think you're gonna drop. Do you wish you were back there at the carpenter shop. With the plane and the lathe. The work never drove you mad. You're a maker, a creator. Not just somebody's dad. From the temple walls to the New York night. Our decisions rest on a man. When I take the stand. When I take the stand. Will he hold my hand. Will my faith stand still or run away. And the desert. It's a hell of a place to find heaven. Forty years lost in the wilderness looking for God. And you climb to the top of the mountain. Looking down on the city where you were born. On the years since you left. Gave you time to sit back and reflect. Better you than me. Better you than me. Better you than me. Yes. Well the holy night is upon you. Do you see both sides, do they shove you around. Better you than me. Joseph. Better you than me. Joseph. Joseph. Joseph. Joseph. Than me. Better you than me. Better you. Better you. Better you. Than me.

joy ride,"It's getting close to sundown over the Sierra. Stranded on the freeway burning with desire. She was on the sidewalk looking for a night light. We talked about the real things. And drove into the fire. Headlights on the highway. The desert wind is howling. Rattlesnakes and romance. Is filling with the rain. Candy apple red dress. Bleeding when she kissed me. Heaven in a ragtop. Take away my pain. When your chips are down. When your highs are low. Joyride. Move across the night. Like a separate wind. Pulled up to a motel. ""Vacancy"" was buzzing. Pink and dirty neon. Settle on the hood. Wrap your arms around me. Come a little closer. Stumble in the twilight. And fell onto the floor. Loving Mona Lisa. Dreaming of the free world. Lipstick on the nightstand. And demons at the door. When your chips are down. When your highs are low. Joyride. Move across the night. Like a separate wind. When your hopes and dreams. Lose the will to go. Joyride. Reaching for the light. Knowing we can't win. There`s something in the distance. A glorious existence. A simple celebration. A place you've never been before. Tell me that you wanna go. Reaching for the light. knowing we can't win. When your chips are down. When your highs are low. Joyride. All your hopes and dreams. All you need to know. Joyride"

Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves. And give him all of my love. All of my friends say I should move on. She's just another girl. Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard. And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be. And it's a great big world. And she's just another girl. I could be reeling them in, left and right. Something's got a hold on me, tonight.

out of my mind,We're building up a kingdom. We pray it never falls. I can lose my temper. You can put up walls. And I hate when it gets serious. It's like we're going blind.

And every fighter goes down. Just slow down and turn the cheek. [chorus]. Because peace of mind. Is easy to find when the time is right. So come away, come away. Come away, come here. Come, I'm callin', come. [outro]. Peace of mind is easy to find. When the time is right. So come away, come away. Come away, come here. Come, I'm callin', come"
prize fighter,"She's a pillar by the day, a fire by the night. She's a famous architect, like Frank Lloyd Wright. When it comes to tightrope walkin', she's world renowned. Her elegance and charm are worthy of praise. And I heard she used to throw for the Oakland A's. She works 268 hours a week, I've yet to meet her match. A marvel of modern science. She's a natural born pioneer. I can't make up my mind,. Should I put her on display or hide her?. I'm gonna be her prize fighter. I know that she's out of my league. I'm gonna be her prize fighter. My uniform has been decreed. She's a daughter of the gods, got a lot of clout. If she's ever in a bind, I'll get her out. And sometimes I have these nightmares, in the middle of the day. Where a hay-makin' gypsy steals her away. There ain't no doubt about it. I'm a slave to her shade of love. One day her majesty the Queen, unprovoked and unforeseen. Is gonna fly her over to England, put that sword on her shoulder,. And knight her!. I'm gonna be her prize fighter. No label's gonna change where she's from. I'm gonna be her prize fighter. And I'm dancin' to the beat of her drum. She's always on my side, rich or poor. And she's with me all the way to the Golden Door. My lioness, my pièce de résistance. My only way. I'm gonna drive me an El Dorado. The colour of her marbly eyes. With twin bullet tail lights. And plates that we desire. I'm gonna be her prize fighter. Though the weather may be foul. I'm gonna be her prize fighter. Though the wind and the wolves may howl. (Prize fighter). Through the sunshine, through the rain. I'm gonna be her prize fighter. Over and over again"

I can't do the talks, like they talk on the TV. And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you. And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat, and bad company. And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme.

sweet talk,"Lift me up on my honour. Take me over this spell. Get this weight off my shoulders. I've carried it well. Loose these shackles of pressure. Shake me out of these chains.

They said unto his disciples. Why eateth your Master. With publicans and senators?. But when Jesus heard that. He said unto them. They that be whole need not a physician. But they that are sick. I walked into town. With a message for my old man. I've got the last two chapters of Matthew. In my hand. Steve painting houses while Bobby went. And gone insane. They buried my sister.

the cowboy's christmas ball,"Way out in North Nevada, where the Trukee's waters flow. Where the cattle are ""a-browzin'' and the Spanish ponies grow. Where the Norther comes whistlin' from beyond the Neutral strip. And the prairie dogs are sneezin' as if they had ""the Grip"". Where the coyotes come a-howlin' round the ranches after dark. And the blue-birds are singin' to the lovely ""medder lark"". Where the big horns are grazin' and the lonely plovers call. It was there that I attended ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball"". The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles. The ladies ""kinder scatterin'"" had gathered in for miles. The room was togged out gorgeous with mistletoe and shawls. And candles flickered frescoes around the airy walls. The ""wimmin folks"" looked lovely, the boys looked kinder treed. Till their leader commenced yellin': ""Hey, fellers, let's stampede"". The music started sighin' and a-wailin' through the hall. As a kind of introduction to ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball"". The leader was a fellow that came from Swenson's Ranch. They called him ""Windy Billy,"" from ""little Dead-man's Branch"". His rig was ""kinder keerless,"" big spurs and high-heeled boots. He had the reputation that comes when ""fellers shoots"". His voice was like the bugle upon the mountain's height. His feet were animated, an' a mighty movin' sight. When he commenced to holler, ""Neow, fellers, stake yer pen!. Lock horns to all them heifers, an' russle 'em like men. Saloot yer lovely critters; neow swing an' let 'em go. Climb the grape vine round 'em, all hands do-ce-do!. And Mavericks, jine the round-up, jest skip her waterfall"". Huh! hit wuz gittin' happy, ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball!"". Don't tell me 'bout cotillions, or germans. No sir 'ee!. That whirl at Carson City just takes the cake with me. I'm sick of lazy shufflin's, of them I've had my fill. Give me a fronteer breakdown, backed up by Wild Bill. McAllister ain't nowhere! when Windy leads the show. I've seen 'em both in harness, an' so I sorter know. Oh, Bill, I sha'n't forget yer, and I'll oftentimes recall. That lively-gaited sworray, ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball"". Oh, Bill, I sha'n't forget yer, and I'll oftentimes recall. That lively-gaited sworray, ""The Cowboys' Christmas Ball"""

the way it was,"I drove through the desert last night. I carried the weight of our last fight. Elvis singing ""Don't be cruel"". And I wonder if you feel it too. It's like we're going under. Somewhere outside the lonely esmeralda county line. The question of my heart came to my mind. If I go on. With you by my side. Can it be. The way it was. When we met. Did you forget all about those golden nights?. Maybe a thief stole your heart. Or maybe we just drifted apart. I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield.

The way it was. When we met. Did you forget all about those golden nights?. All of our plans have fallen through. Sometimes a dream, it don't come true. Darling! Darling!. (If we go on, can it be?).

The seed was planted. You took us in like your own. Now we're bound by tradition. My how we've grown. From Dave's apartment to Wembley. Singing. I got a soul but I'm not a soldier. Da da da da da. And the decade disappeared like a sinking ship. But we persevere, God give us hope. But we still fear what we don't know. The devil's water and the good old days. Ain't we all just runaways?. Day oh. Day oh. Day oh. Day oh. Day oh. Day oh. Day oh. Day oh"
when i'm sixty-four,"When I get older losing my hair. Many years from now. Will you still be sending me a Valentine. Birthday greetings bottle of wine?. If I'd been out till quarter to three. Would you lock the door?. Will you still need me, will you still feed me. When i'm sixty-four?. You'll be older too. And if you say the word. I could stay with you. I could be handy, mending a fuse. When your lights have gone. You can knit a sweater by the fireside. Sunday mornings go for a ride. Doing the garden, digging the weeds. Who could ask for more?. Will you still need me, will you still feed me. When I'm sixty-four. Every summer we can rent a cottage. In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear. We shall scrimp and save. Grandchildren on your knee. Vera, Chuck and Dave. Send me a postcard, drop me a line. Stating point of view. Indicate precisely what you mean to say. Your's sincerely wasting away. Give me your answer, fill in a form. Mine for evermore. Will you still need me, will you still feed me. When I'm sixty-four?"
when you were young,"You sit there in your heartache. Waiting on some beautiful boy. To save you from your old ways. You play forgiveness. Watch it now- here he comes. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But he talks like a gentlemen. Like you imagined when you were young. Can we climb this mountain. I don't know. Higher now than ever before. I know we can make it if we take it slow. Let's take it easy. Easy now, watch it go. We're burning down the highway skyline. On the back of a hurricane that started turning. When you were young. When you were young. And sometimes you close your eyes and see the place where you. Used to live. When you were young. They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet. You don't have to drink right now. But you can dip your feet. Every once in a little while. You sit there in your heartache. Waiting on some beautiful boy. To save you from your old ways. You play forgiveness. Watch it now- here he comes. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But he talks like a gentlemen. Like you imagined when you were young. When you were young. I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But more than you'll ever know"

where the white boys dance,"Take me to the place where the white boys dance.. Take me to the place where they run and play.. My baby is gone, you might have a chance.. Just take me to the place where the white boys dance.. They hug in silence,. As the sun sets.. On their empty street,. Their suspicions where they rise and hide.. And then who sweeps them off she doesn't leave.. She walks inside him,. Pours a strong one.. Put her mind at ease.. It's the calm before another storm.. And the friendship’s from the whiskey to the keys.. Take me to the place where the white boys dance.. Take me to the place where they run and play.. My baby is gone, you might have a chance.. Just take me to the place where the white boys... dance.. Her heart is racing.. She phones a friend to say:. I'm in an awful place.. That fool’s been messin' round on me. I've seen it in his eyes and on his face. Hold on a minute.. You're talking crazy.. Don't be that jealous girl.. Just telephone you need an hour or two.. Cause we're gonna go and change somebodies word.. Take me to the place where the white boys dance.. Take me to the place where they run and play.. My baby is gone, you might have a chance.. Just take me to the place where the white boys dance.. It's the calm before another storm.... It's the calm before another storm. And the friendship’s from the whiskey to the keys.. Take me to the place where the white boys dance.. Take me to the place where they run and play.. My baby is gone, you might have a chance.. Just take me to the place where the white boys... dance."

So many, many times. I don't have any skin. But that's just the way it goes"
