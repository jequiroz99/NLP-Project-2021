back to the countryside,The night is bright and cold. And I am feeling old. Cos I am filling my head. With scenes from the past. The night is dark and warm. And something's doing me harm. Maybe the sad books on the shelf. And the woe of looking at myself. Cos the nights always end up sad. Though I thought my youth would last. How I really wanted to be young. Young in the head that now's dead. I wish I was the boy in the middle of the sun. I wish I was the one to make your heart sigh. I wish I was the sun
beloved,"Get on the turskish line. you've never written. a diamond under my door. I'm trought this door. sometimes it closes my eyes. sometimes it comes on time. some lies were hidden. the sun shines. in the son's heart. then flows the hat,. then grows the red carpet. I wasn't ready to be loved. by you.. Almost a year ago,dreamin'. alive, pushing those pills around. I was dead, I was dead. climbing that road. my grave is there. my eyes are swamp again. Wasn't ready to be loved. by you."
blood talkin',never sang words so sad. i never carried the world in my head. but the words i used to say. don't fit anymore on our way. not even that blood talkin'. you'll find me gone soon. maybe till the next noon. and your life will be so calm. without sad pictures on your home. nothing but happiness. no more mornings filled with smiles. no more sensitive sighs. cause the way you treated me today. showed me i'll never see you again. i'm wearing so well this pain.
christmas crack,"There are new things in my eyes. That they must be told. I met an ancient world. But it hit me. So rude end free. I gotta unfurl my tongue. Immediately. Be with a face in the sea. Being small. And hopefully.. I must. New places I've been round, love. And it hurts me to tell you. Been blind a cigarrette-me-up. And it hit like old feeling. Down to the seaside we walked. One thousand smiles. Foreign whisper. Foreign whisper. Get on my boad, love. There are new seas to be found. Gorgeous, headache, you appear. As the craziest thought of man. Help me. I gotta shoot my aim. It must flow petry inside my veins. They must spit and turn my eyes to the underground. Where I find sweet taste. And you know what I mean. Get on my boat, love. Let's sleep till we find the land of our pa. Cause this lonesome road takes us somewhere. But surely not the way home. Your smile is such a chill. But it shows me here's our last randezvous. We're brown of sin. The sand is my best friend. There are new things in my eyes. That they must be told."
contrary's theory,"I don't believe in justice. Just believe in the sun and in you.. When I said i's very tired. Someone said 'life's beautiful'. But life showed me the contrary. Yeah, life showed me its darkest side. Made me hate all I should love. Painted my eyes in a colour I dislike. I remember the days I won. I thought they were poor days. But now I know (I sadly know). How, how good they were. Cause everything's going wrong. I can't even play with my head. And it seems the more I live. The less I forget the past. Words of freedom. Cleaning all but me. (they won't find me here). Yellow hair,. Hope you could hear me. You'd take me from this fear. And this pain. Pain - I hate this word. Pain - I hate this word. Pain - I hate this word"
dolores,"i know my words are sick. well, so do i. but come gather ‘round n’ i'll tell a tale. about a man that sold his eyes. to lose weight and to get cute. to reach a girl who's just like you. to forget a girl he never had. then he sold his nose. for an unknown guy. a strange guy that some. people used to call god. well, i guess he was really needing. a new nose and i'm not kidding. i swear it's not any kind of joke. now he's on the road again. looking for someone. to buy his dreams. and ears and thumbs. someone to care for him. not to leave him lost in sin. neither in pain or happiness. life is nothing but a joke. and i'm getting tired. life is nothing but a joke. and i'm getting tired. life is nothing but a joke. and i'm getting tired. life is nothing but a joke. and i'm getting tired..."
dream about your love,"I gazed a forgivelessness star. Thinkin' about my life. I've been so old and young nowadays. Fell in love twice. I found love three times. I found another world. The boys downtown are selling birds. Selling you and I. They said you've gone away. I didn't believe'em then. My eyes became a strange old led. A red bleach in my sight. And I dreamed about the world I was gonna find. I opened my eyes, I checked out the time. I heard my name, there was no one to blame. I thought about the next shoes. And it wrecked my mind. I thought about the day. I was not gonna find... Then you came back again. I felt so happy then. Look, our cats and dogs. Are lying together on the grass field. They smoke the same cigar. Dreaming about the one they love. So dream, babe, babe about the one you love. This way you're gonna fill the world. With love. This way you're gonna face all your days. With certainlies. Babe, babe, babe dream about your love."
foreign complaint,"""foreign complaint"". . I got something to write before this letter slips in. I got no one by my side and finally now, i feel fine. As the leaves are falling, as the sun is going down.. My eyes are in the wind, but every summer they melt down. Here no one knows my name, they never see me around. I pretend i'm from spain and i don't even go out. I never thought it would be so hard to live in other town. And i always remind of you when sleep gets me down. Every dusk i watch, well, it always leaves me sad. Cause that time i got you, the dawn was the time to bed. And i never saw the dawn anymore, now i have to crawl. To get up from the bed, and then get off of the ground. I'm not looking for and i couldn't even get a job. Lately i'm too weak and i still got the bucks you gave me. People scream that i'm a slob, but i pretend it's not with me. I just keep my face straight, with my eyes staring at my feet. Sometimes i miss my rock'n'roll records and my friends. But as long as i'll die, they'll take me out of their heads. I'm not saying i was unwanted, it's just something usual. Maybe i never really liked'em but i miss them all. Last week i went to a bar, and there was no one at it.. And i've been thinking how sometimes love's hard to fit. I remembered when i's a child and how beautiful were my hair. And when i discovered that love's something hard to bear. But when the bar closed down, i started my thinkin' again. And going back home i cried a little bit but then. I cleaned my face with memories from my mom and my dad. And for a quick moment i forgot that they are dead. I heard someone saying love's bitter, well, i didn't disagree. But later when i was sleeping i've been waken by a dream. I don't remember well, but i only know it was about you. Then i passed all the day upset till i accept that i love you. But you know life goes on, as it goes on your life. And i'd be lying if i said that someday i'll be back. Cause these words haunt myself, i prefer to ignore the pain. Cause i'll always love you, but i don't want to see you again."
have a dope day,"I walk through misty streets. And my feet don't touch the ground. Every metal riff seems to be a gentle sound. I enter inside the store. And the band begins to play. I look for Sgt. Pepper. But the only thing he says is. Have a dope day. A strike in your head. I walk through a misty sea. That always steals my shoes. And the dope day is the only one. That's not at all blue. So join us on this trip. And join my heart tonight. We hope you survive. With your face cold on a sigh. Have a dope day. A strike in your head. I'm on drugs, you're on drugs. We're on drugs. And we're building a perfect world"
hey yo silver,"Hey Yo Silver. A horse broke onto the bar, left me wildy here (Oh Silver). Ripped down my chest with promises of the best (Oh Silver). Remember when we were down on the road (Oh Silver). But all the way is the way back down. Gonna take a look around. Gonna drive to New Orleans. Honey, you know what this means. Cause you and I we been through love. You and I been takin' turns. Tomorrow's parties won't have to wait that long. Cos our the last year's songs showed all that we were. Hey Yo Silver.

But our last years songs showed all that we were. And it's us but there's a sorrow just won't let you sleep. And I take you with me everywhere I weep. Hey Yo Silver."
into the ice,"Into The Ice (Helio Flanders). ""Into The Ice"". . Love is the word I said a million times. Love, slow.. Love is the word I meant to say all the time. Love, gone.. God left my hand, I fell into the ice. There was nothin' there, I couldn't breath. I started to cry when you said goodbye. Your kindness sheltered my life from any harm. Love is the word you said a few times. Love, so far.. I never knew how was this love. Tough, love.. I'll never forget what took me out of bed. Made me sweat and will make me go back. I shut my eyes everytime it gets dark. Cause I hardly know, I hardly know what's. Love."

Said I was funny. Funny was I?. I woke up naked, I stole a car. Drove through the boundary. Called up Chico, he asked me what. I said meet me at the foundry. Ahh....

They're telling the stories that never should be told. They're smoking sad cigarrettes that never should be smoked. I open an old book and I try to read it again. But the dust over my thoughts had gone to my heart, had blown me as it could. So shelter Lord, my heart cause it's been cold. So shelter Lord, i got nothin' else to hold. And over again I feel the sand falling off of my tired eyes. Over again the party's done and the funeral hits the stars. Over again we're singing about all the unpleased thoughts of God. Over again we're trying to win the war.. Dreaming, sometimes awaken, one day nothing will make sense. Nowadays I just close my heart at lovers who pretend. To love like I am and like I want the world to be. But I missed the bus to meet you and the eyes that would make see. So shelter Lord, our lives cause we've been bad. So shelter Lord, we lost all we've ever had. [I challenge you to a fight, you old vampire. So please pick up your gun and try to hit me, try to put me down.

the last time i saw you,"The 1st time I saw you. I did try hard to burn my eyes. Life was but a sad dream. I was but a sad breath. But you were something like sand. When sunlight hits the sea. The 2nd time I saw you. I was about to take the road. I asked would you wait for me. You said life ain't a highway. Better if we'd been born. As siamese songbirds. The 3rd time I saw you. We went to the zoo. All steady hot beers, sorrowful monkeys. Big eyes laughing. With I had not held hands. The 4th time I saw you. It was like I was gonna die. I was waiting outside. You just had a new guy. Asked me why, I, I. Son, won't you come along?. We have no time for another song. Won't you sing along?. We have no sea, child. The 5th time I saw you. He was traveling abroad. And your eyes, they were not here. You just made new friends. While I tried to stop with cigarrettes. The 6th time I saw you. I was properly insane. For the whisky I had drunk. The drugs I'd taken. Gimme just one chance you will realise. The 7th time I saw you. You were married again. If I had just once kissed you. Things wouldn't be the same. Surely the sky'd be different. The 8th time I saw you. I was strummin' the guitar. & your ears were not for me. My ears were a-bleeding. The waiter was blind. Please someone blind my eyes. The last time I saw you. It was about five a.m.. You approached me in a strange car. Finally kissed me. Then did wave goodbye. Before you disappear. Sometimes I ache, babe. Or I ain't hard enough to stand. But the days they just drown me. Coming back from work. Having sour breakfast. Seasick from your chest."
