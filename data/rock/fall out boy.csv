Windows down. In the back of yellow checkered cars. The tombstones were waiting. They were half-engraved. They knew it was over. Just didn't know the date.

golden,How cruel. Is the golden rule?. When the lives we lived are only golden-plated. And I knew the lights of the city were too heavy for. me. And though I carried karats for everyone to see. And I saw god cry in the reflection of my enemies. And all the lovers with no time for me. And all the mothers raise their babies. To stay away from me.... Tongues on the sockets. Of electric dreams. Where the sewage of youth. Drowned the spark of my. Teens. And I knew the lights of the city were too heavy for. me. (Too heavy for me). And thought I carried karats for everyone to see. (Everyone to see). And I saw god cry in the reflection of my enemies. And all the lovers with no time for me. And of all the mothers raise their babies. To stay away from me.... And pray they don't grow up to be me

it's hard to say 'i do' when i don't,"I speak fast and I'm not gonna repeat myself, no. So listen carefully to every word I say:. ""I'm the only one who's gonna get away with making excuses today"".

And I've got the red carpet blues baby. So put your hands in the air and don't make a sound. But don't get the wrong idea. We're gonna shoot you. We're gonna shoot you. And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet. That could change just how this goes. No. We're gonna shoot you. We're gonna shoot you. Whoa. When I said that I'd return to you I meant more like a relapse. Now and again I think ""His and her's"" ""For better or worse"". But the only ring I want buried with me are the ones around my eyes.

jet pack blues,"I got those jet pack blues. Just like Judy. The kind that makes june feel like september. I'm the last one that you'll ever remember. And I'm trying to find that peace of mind.

jet pack blues (remix) (feat. big k.r.i.t.),"[Big K. R. I. T:]. I know you heard that I got nominated. Won't you walk the red carpet with it. With a dress I bought you, it's awful when I've been gone too long. And I call like it ain't been a while. That promise that I hold you down seem like a lyric from your favorite song. I'm not surprised if you step aside and get another. Way too hard to reach like a boy in a bubble. Always on a shuttle to another planet. It's crazy how my crash landed only leave you damaged. I just keep up all the pieces that I left you in. Hoping praying when I'm home I see you again. And you understand I'm being the man I need to be. To provide for the lives of you and me. Cause you know that. I got those jet pack blues. Just like Judy. The kind that makes June feel like September. I'm the last one that you'll ever remember. And I'm trying to find my peace of mind.

I'm talking about another green room, another hotel. Doing what I'm doing a lot, doing it well. Maybe we should kick it next time, go out all the time. Bone appetite it's so bittersweet when I come around. Always on the phone texting and scrolling talking bout business. Swiping my card could never fix it when I visit. And that's the realest drop you whispered in my ear. The last time you cried on the phone, I felt the tear, believe it or not. When I vamp, I give you all that I got. I do this for us so don't ask me to stop. The lights and glamour ain't the reason why I put in this work. I'm seconds from the stage but I'm putting you first. Despite my absence, words and closed captions. Read me like a simple I love you wrote on a napkin. This is more than just a fly by night action. You're the fuel everlasting to keep my jet packing. I've got those jet pack blues. Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me. Honey, don't you leave. Don't you remember how we used to split a drink. It never mattered what it was, I think. Our hands were just that close. The sweetness never lasts, you know. She's in a long black coat tonight. Waiting for me in the downpour outside.

just one yesterday (feat. foxes),"I thought of angels, choking on their halos. Get them drunk on rose water. See how dirty I can get them. Pulling out their fragile teeth. And clip their tiny wings. Anything you say can. And will be held against you. So only say my name. It will be held against you. Anything you say can and will be held against you. So only say my name. If heaven's grief brings hell's rain. Then I'd trade all my tomorrows. For just one yesterday. (I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday. (I saved it all for you). I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way. Still I'd trade all my tomorrows. For just one yesterday. (I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday.

I don't have the right name, or the right looks. But I have twice the heart. Anything you say can and will be held against you. So only say my name. It will be held against you. Anything you say can and will be held against you. So only say my name. If heaven's grief brings hell's rain. Then I'd trade all my tomorrows. For just one yesterday. (I know I'm bad news). For just one yesterday. (I saved it all for you). I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way. Still I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday. (I know I'm bad news) for just one yesterday. (I saved it all for you) for just one yesterday. If I spilled my guts. The world would never look at you the same way. Now I'm here to give you hope my love. So I can watch your face. As I take it all away away away-ay-yay. If heaven's grief brings hell's rain. Then I'd trade all my tomorrows. For just one yesterday.

And I'm not sure if it matters. If you are the shores, I am the waves begging for big moons. I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town. I know this hurts, it was meant to. Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one. And it's mind over (you don't) matter. This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters. But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming. Into microphones for attention. Because we're just so bored. I never knew that you would pick it apart, oh. I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts. I used to obsess over living,. Now I only obsess over you. Tell me you'd like boys like me better. In the dark lying on top of you. This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters"
"you're crashing, but you're no wave","The D.A. is dressed to the nines.. In the mirror he practices all his lines.. To his closing argument twelve hearts beat in favor.. I'm guessing that he read the morning paper.. The headline reads, ""The Man Hangs, But The Jury Doesn't"".. And everyone's looking for relief.. United States versus disbelief.. Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle.. Clear your throat and face the world.. The verdict falls like bachelors for bad luck girls.. Only breathing with the aid of denial.. Case open, case shut,. But you could pay to close it like a casket.. Baby boy can't lift his headache head.. Isn't it tragic? (Whoaaa-ooo.). He glances at his peers sitting, seven to twelve,. Stacked on one to six.. The gallery is hushed.. Boys in three pieces dream of grandstanding and bravado.. The city sleeps in a cell not withstanding what we all know.. Hang on a rope or bated breath.. Whichever you prefer.. And everyone's looking for relief.. A bidding war for an old friend's grief.. The cause, the kid, the cause, the charm and the curse.. Not a word that could make you comprehend.. Too well dressed for the witness stand.. The press prays for whichever headline's worse.. Case open, case shut,. But you could pay to close it like a casket.. Baby boy can't lift his headache head.. Isn't it tragic? (Whoaaa-ooo.). Fresh pressed suit and tie.. Unimpressed birds sing and die.. Can talk my way out of anything.. The foreman reads the verdict:. ""In the above entitled actions we find the defendant,. Guilty..."". Case open, case shut,. But you could pay to close it like a casket.. Baby boy can't lift his headache head.. Isn't it tragic?. Case open, case shut,. But you could pay to close it like a casket.. Baby boy can't lift his headache head.. Isn't it tragic? (Whoaaa-ooo.)"
young and menace,"We've gone way too fast for way too long. And we were never supposed to make it half this far. And I lived so much life, lived so much life. I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice. Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx. I woke up in my shoes again. But somewhere you exist singing. Oops I, did it again. I forgot what I was losing my mind about. Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind. And send a message that I was. Young and a menace. Woke up on the wrong side of reality. And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me. And as far as the time, far as the time. Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived. Oops I, did it again. I forgot what I was losing my mind about. Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind. And send a message that I was. Young and a menace. If I am off the deep end. I'm just here to become the best yet. I'm just here for the psych assessment. I'm just here for the. For the... fall. We've gone way too fast for way too long"
young volcanoes,"When Rome's in ruins. We are the lions. Free of the coliseums. In poison places. We are anti-venom. We're the beginning of the end. Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds. And it's all over now before it has begun. We've already won. We are wild, we are like young volcanoes. We are wild, Americana, exotica. Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby? Yeah!. Oh!. Come on. Make it easy, say I never mattered. Run it up the flagpole. We will teach you how to make boys next door. Out of assholes. (Ha Ha). Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds. And it's all over now before it has begun. We've already won. We are wild, we are like young volcanoes. We are wild, Americana, exotica. Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby? Yeah!. Oh!. We are wild, we are like young volcanoes. We are wild, Americana, exotica. Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby? Yeah!. Oh!"
your name is crushed in my mind,"If I had one last moment,. Until my head is empty. My hands would be at your throat,. or maybe on your hips.. Before you say goodbye tonight,. Baby, just tell me this. ""You'll always be my only love, always and forever hun."". Tonight is the night when I surrender. Myself to you. I give up, this is over.. Now and forever more, baby walk out that door.. Kiss me one last time again, before. I go and change my mind, tell me what a dick I am.. Oh God, You're just too beautiful when you beg.. Tonight is the night when I surrender. Myself to you. I give up, this is over.. Now and forever more, baby walk out that door.. Baby, walk out that door.. Baby, walk out that door.. Baby, walk out that door.. Baby, walk out that door."
