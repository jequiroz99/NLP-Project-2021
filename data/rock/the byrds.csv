In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' you. Take me for a trip upon your magic swirling ship. All my senses have been stripped. My hands can't feel to grip. My toes too numb to step.

fifth dimension,"5d (Fifth Dimension). The Byrds. Oh, how is it that I could come out to you,. And be still floatin',. And never hit bottom but keep falling through,. Just relaxed and paying attention?. All my two-dimensional boundaries were gone,. I had lost to them badly,. I saw that world crumble and thought I was dead,. But I found my senses still working.. And as I continued to drop through the hole,. I found all surrounding,. To show me that joy innocently is,. Just be quiet and feel it around you.. (Bridge). And I opened my heart to the whole universe,. And I found it was loving,. And I saw the great blunder my teachers had made,. Scientific delirium madness.. I will keep falling as long as I live,. Ah, without ending,. And I will remember the place that is now,. That has ended before the beginning .... Oh, how is it that I could come out to you,. And be still floatin',. And never hit bottom but keep falling through,. Just relaxed and paying attention?"
wasn't born to follow,"Oh I'd rather go and journey where the diamond crest is flowing and. Run across the valley beneath the sacred mountain and. Wander through the forest. Where the trees have leaves of prisms and break the light in colors. That no one knows the names of. And when it's time I'll go and wait beside a legendary fountain. Till I see your form reflected in it's clear and jewelled waters. And if you think I'm ready. You may lead me to the chasm where the rivers of our vision. Flow into one another. I will want to die beneath the white cascading waters. She may beg, she may plead, she may argue with her logic. And then she'll know the things I learned. That really have no value in the end she will surely know. I wasn't born to follow"
all the things,"All The Tings (McGuinn/Levy). See the sun how bright it is, it never was before. See the sun it shines right through my door but noone's there.

See the earth it sleeps beneath my heels as I pass through. I see tears that I never shed in every drop of dew. All the things I want today, all the things I wasted on the way. Hear the sky singing the songs that I could have played. Too busy talking to prove that I was not afraid. See this dried up broken straw turning into rock. See this dried up broken straw forgotten and left behind. and see deeds that I never done are flowing in the wine. All the things I want today, all the things I wasted. All the things I want today, all the things I wasted. All the things I want today, all the things I wasted on the way. The Byrds ""Untitled"". Columbia Records 1970"
antique sandy,"Antique Sandy (Roger McGuinn). Antique Sandy lived in the woods. And she'd go to the stream when the weather was good. She'd take down the washin for her old man to wear. And she tried not to get eaten by the bear. She'd fly to the market in her worn out old balloon. That she traded with the flyer for an antique silver spoon. And when she got home she'd cook upon the wooden stove. And she'd go to sleep and listen to the whispers of the grove. At night she dreamed of places where she lived when she was young. Where the corn strip stretched for miles like a giant serpent's tongue. Electric lights and phone bells and every light insane (?). Like a hundred thousand hungry miles meeting at her brain. I greet her in the morning when she wakes up in my arms. And I tell her that I love her and I'll keep her free from harm. I hold her close she matters she is all the world to me. Cause she's my Antique Sandy and she's in love with me. Copyright @ 1971 Patian & Jackelop Music/BMI. From the ""Farther Along"" LP Columbia Records 1971"

my back pages,"Written by Bob Dylan. Crimson flames tied through my years. Rollin high and mighty trapped. Countless violent flaming roads. Using ideas as my map. ""We'll meet on edges soon"" said I. Proud 'neath heated brow. Ah but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. Half wracked prejudice leaped forth. ""Rip down all hate"" I screamed. Lies that life is black and white. Spoke from my skull. I dreamed. Romantic flanks of musketeers. Foundationed deep, somehow. Ah but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand. At the mongrel dogs who teach. Fearing not I'd become my enemy. In the instant that I preach. Sisters fled by confusion boats. Mutiny from stern to bow. Ah but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. My guard stood hard when abstract threats. Too noble to neglect. Deceived me into thinking. I had something to protect. Good and bad I define these terms. Quite clear, no doubt, somehow. Ah but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now."
you're still on my mind,"The jukebox is playing a honky tonk song. One more I keep saying and then I'll go home. What good would it do me, I know what I'll find. An empty bottle of broken hearts. and you're still on my mind. The people are laughing and having their fun. While I sit here crying over what you have done. My pockets are empty, my last drink of wine,. An empty bottle of broken hearts. and you're still on my mind. Alone and forsaken, so blue I could die. I just sit here drinking. till the bottle runs dry. To try and forget you. I turn to the wine. An empty bottle of broken hearts. and you're still on my mind"
the christian life,Written by Louvin/Louvin. My buddies tell me that I should've waited. They say I'm missing a whole world of fun. But I still love them and I sing with pride. I like the Christian life. I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call. For what is a friend who'd want you to fall. Others find pleasure in things I despise. I like the Christian life. My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus. They say I'm missing a whole world of fun. I live without them and walk in the light. I like the Christian life. I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call. For what is a friend who'd want you to fall. Others find pleasure in things I despise. I like the Christian life. I like the Christian life.
he was a friend of mine,"Traditional with additional lyrics by Jim McGuinn. He was a friend of mine. He was a friend of mine. His killing had no purpose. No reason, or rhyme. He was a friend of mine. He was in Dallas town. He was in Dallas town. Form a sixth floor window. A gunner shot him down. He died in Dallas town. He never knew my name. He never knew my name. Though I never met him. I knew him just the same. Oh, he was a friend of mine."
chimes of freedom,"Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll. We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing. As majestic bells of bolts, struck shadows in the sounds. Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing. Flashing for the warriors, whose strength is not to fight. Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight. And for each and every underdog soldier in the night. We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far off corner flashed. And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting. Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones. Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting. Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail,. For the LONESOME HEARTED lovers, with too personal a tale. And for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. Starry eyed and laughing, as I recall when we were caught. Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended. And we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look. Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended. Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed. For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse. And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe. We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing"
don't doubt yourself babe,"Don't doubt yourself, babe. Let your feet stand up for your.......... I know what's running through your mind. It take you.........to capture your time. Make love...........straight and narrow, oh oh. Don't doubt yourself, girl. Let...............you know........well. For all the............been done to you. ...................so don't be blue. .................been through you're lucky oh oh. Don't doubt yourself when. Daylight fades and darkness begin.

The truth's proved to be found. Hard to take first time around. So don't you worry it's gonna be alright oh oh."

absolute happiness,"Absolute Happiness (Skip Battin/Kim Fowley). Dressed in country cloth and sitting on the floor. Warmed by antique sun amid the green timber. Held together by uncertainty, climb the Babel tower. Looking up instead of down, we need room to gamble. Sunday morning exercises started stand alone. Filling in the vacant spaces with the dreams of truth. Intimitations slowly sinking in, see the dreams we dreamed. Looking up instead of down still a-hiding. Absolute happiness unties the ropes that bind. Greatness and unity shines within the mind. Shines within the mind. So long ago I promised to conscience and easily wrote a code. So the Lord and I'll soon be back together again. Men'll always be equal times a bad connection. Looking up instead of down only good prevails. Absolute happiness unties the ropes that bind. Greatness and unity shines within the mind. Shines within the mind. Copyright @ 1971 Kyo Music & Bad Boy Music. From the ""Byrdmaniax"" LP Columbia Records"

amazing grace,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was blind but now am found. Was blind but now I see. It was grace that taught my heart to fear. And grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believed. Through many dangers, toils and snares. I have already come. 'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far. And grace will lead me home. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds. In a believer's ear. It soothes his sorrows, heals the wounds. And drives away his fear. Must Jesus bear the cross alone. And all the world go free. No, there's a cross for ev'ry one. And there's a cross for me"

But when you're singing from the soul. They fail to see your final goal. They only tell you that. You have a long ways left to go. So you rhyme the changing rhyme. With one wheel spinning and one on the ground. Then falling victim to the game of time. You place your name out in the lost and the found. So many people gather round. A thousand voices lift their praise. For you have reached the top. So they give you all they got. But when you're singing from the soul. They fail to see your final goal. They only tell you that. You have a long ways left to go
chestnut mare,"Written by Roger McGuinn and Jacques Levy. Always alone never with a herd. Prettiest mare I've ever seen. You'll have to take my word. I'm gonna' catch that horse if I can. And when I do I'll give her my brand. Well I was up on Stony Ridge after this chestnut mare. I'd been chasin' her for weeks. Oh, I'd catch a glimpse of her every once in a while. Takin' her meal, or bathin. A fine lady. This one day I happened to be real close to her. I saw her standin' over there. So I snuck up to her nice and easy. And I got my rope out. And I flung it in the air. I'm gonna' catch that horse if I can. And when I do I'll give her my brand. And we'll be friends for life. She'll be just like a wife. I'm gonna' catch that horse if I can. Well I got her, and I'm pullin' on her, she's pullin' back. like a mule goin' up a ladder. I take this chance and I jump up on her. Damned if I don't land right on top of her. Well she takes off, runnin' up on to that ridge. Higher than I've ever been before. She's runnin' along just fine, till she stops. Something spooked her. It's a sidewinder, all coiled and ready to strike. She doesn't know what to do for a second. But then she jumps off the edge. Me holding on. Above the clouds. Higher than eagles were gliding. Suspended in the sky. Over the moon. Straight for the sun we were riding. My eyes were filled with light. Behind us black walls. Below us a bottomless canyon. Floating with no sound. Gulls far below. Seemed to be suddenly rising. Exploding all around. I'm gonna' catch that horse if I can. And when I do I'll give her my brand. And we'll be friends for life. She'll be just like a wife. I'm gonna' catch that horse if I can. And we were falling down this crevice, about a mile down I'd say!. I look down and I see this red thing below us. Comin' up real fast and it's our reflection in a little pool of water. About six feet wide, and one foot deep. Crawling down right through it. We hit and we splashed it dry. That's when I lost my hold and she got away. But I'm gonna' try to get her again some day. . I'm gonna' catch that horse if I can. And when I do I'll give her my brand. And we'll be friends for life. She'll be just like a wife. I'm gonna' catch that horse. I'm gonna' catch that horse. I'm gonna' catch that horse if I can. I'm gonna' catch that horse if I can."
child of the universe,Written by Dave Gruisin and Roger McGuinn. Love for anyone who needs her. Innocence is all that feeds her. Rolling through the mist. Floating in a sea of madness. Reaching for the heights of gladness. Or did she exist?. Swirling ions from the stars. Streaming down onto the earth. From a galaxy like ours. Manifested in her birth. Child of the Universe. Giving freely of herself. Purity of truth rehearse. Leaving man her cosmic well. Love for anyone who needs her. Innocence is all that feeds her. Rolling through the mist. Floating in a sea of madness. Reaching for the heights of gladness. Or did she exist?. Vision of an untouched grace. Walking gaily through the sun. No one else could take her place. Nor the work that she'd begun. Love for anyone who needs her. Innocence is all that feeds her. Rolling through the mist. Knowing what is understanding. Patience that is undemanding. Or did she exist?. Or did she exist?. Or did she exist?.
chimes of freedom,"Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll. We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing. As majestic bells of bolts, struck shadows in the sounds. Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing. Flashing for the warriors, whose strength is not to fight. Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight. And for each and every underdog soldier in the night. We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far off corner flashed. And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting. Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones. Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting. Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail,. For the LONESOME HEARTED lovers, with too personal a tale. And for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. Starry eyed and laughing, as I recall when we were caught. Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended. And we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look. Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended. Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed. For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse. And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe. We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing"
citizen kane,Written by Skip Battin and Kim Fowley. Fat ugly fat man swam. In a red tire made of stone. A painted lady paddled next to him. With two poodles on her lap. Garbo quietly picked a flower. While the chauffeur won his check again. And Barrymore took a noon day nap???. And diamond fell like rain. Cisco Kid and a bald headed waitress. Trapped 'neath a bed of brass. The french cook served them chocolates. And some cold cuts on the grass. Louilla ripped her zebra pants. In the polo lounge. And Errol Flynn was not let in. Cause he was coming down. Up in Zanadu diamonds fell like rain. Citizen Kane was king poor Citizen Kane. Valentino suddenly appeared. In his midnight blue tuxedo. Had a falcon on his shoulder. Eating chicken from his hands. And Fatty Arbuckle waddled by. On way to the bath house green. Frankenstein ate the leading lady. And licked the carcass clean. Up in Zanadu diamonds fell like rain. Citizen Kane was king poor Citizen Kane.
cowgirl in the sand,"Cowgirl In The Sand (Neil Young). Hello cowgirl in the sand. Is this place at your command. Can I stay here for awhile. Can I see your sweet sweet smile. Old enough now to change your name. When so many love you, is it the same. It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game. Hello ruby in the dust. Has your band bgun to rust. After all the sin we've had. I was hoping that we'd turn bad. Old enough now to change your name. When so many love you, is it the same. It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game. Hello woman of my dreams. Is it not the way it seems. Purple words on a grey background. To be a woman and to be turned down. Old enough now to change your name. When so many love you, is it the same. It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. ""4 Way Street"" 1970. The Byrds ""Byrds"" Asylum Records 1973"
daytime just makes me feel lonely,"Oh, you know it makes me sad to see you feel so bad. For it happened to you many times before. But if you will come with me. Then girl you will see. That you won't have to cry any more. There's no reason to feel blue, because nobody says to you. And I will..........to see you hurt no more.

deportee,"Words by Woody Guthrie. Music by Martin Hoffman. The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting. The oranges piled up in their creosote dumps. You're flying 'em back to the Mexican border. To spend all their money to wade back again. Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita. Adios mis amigos Jesus y Maria. You wont have a name when you ride the big airplane. All they will call you will be ""deportees"". Some of us are illegal, and others not wanted. Our work contracts up and we have to move on. 600 miles to that Mexican border. They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves. Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita. Adios mis amigos Jesus y Maria. You wont have a name when you ride the big airplane. All they will call you will be ""deportees"". The skyplane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon. A fireball of lightning, shook all our hills. Who are all these friends who are scattered like dry leaves. The radio said they were just ""deportees"". Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita. Adios mis amigos Jesus y Maria. You wont have a name when you ride the big airplane. All they will call you will be ""deportees"". REPEAT."

drug store truck drivin' man,"Written by Roger McGuinn and Gram Parsons. He's a drug store truck drivin man. He's a head of the Ku Klux Klan. When summer rolls around. He'll be lucky if he's not in town. Well he's got him a house on the hill. He plays country records till you've had your fill. He's a fireman's friend, he's an all night DJ. But he sure does think different from the records he plays. He's a drug store truck drivin man. He's a head of the Ku Klux Klan. When summer rolls around. He'll be lucky if he's not in town. Well he don't like the young folks I know. He told me one night on his radio show. He's got him a medal he won in the war. Weighs five hundred pounds and sleeps on his floor. He's a drug store truck drivin man. He's a head of the Ku Klux Klan. When summer rolls around. He'll be lucky if he's not in town. He's been like a father to me. He's the only DJ you can hear after three. I'm an all night musician in a rock 'n' roll band. And why he don't like me, I can't understand. He's a drug store truck drivin man. He's a head of the Ku Klux Klan. When summer rolls around. He'll be lucky if he's not in town. ."
eight miles high,Eight miles high and when you touch down. You'll find that it's stranger than known. Signs in the street that say where you're going. Are somewhere just being their own. Nowhere is there warmth to be found. among those afraid of losing their ground. Rain gray town known for its sound. In places small faces unbound. Round the squares huddled in storms. Some laughing some just shapeless forms. Sidewalk scenes and black limousines. Some living some standing alone.
everybody's been burned,"Everybody's been burned before. Everybody knows the pain. Anyone in this place. Can tell you to your face. Why you shouldn't try to love someone. Everybody knows it never works. Everybody knows and me. I know that door that shuts. Just before you get to the dream. You see.... I know all too well. How to turn, how to run. How to hide behind. A bitter wall of blue. But you die inside. If you choose to hide. So I guess instead, I'll love you."
farther along,"Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder. Why it should be thus all the day long. While there are others living about us. Never molested, though in the wrong. Farther along we'll know more about it. Farther along we'll understand why. Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine. We'll understand it all by and by. When death has come and taken our loved ones. Leaving our home so lonely and drear. Then do we wonder how others prosper. Living so wicked year after year. Farther along we'll know more about it. Farther along we'll understand why. Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine. We'll understand it all by and by. ."

fido,"Fido (John York). Fido stayed all night, he would not go home. I asked him to leave, I said I do not have that bone. I was feelin' lonesome sittin' by the phone. Wide awake stayin' up late wishin' I was home. You were on the outside talking to some chick. I was on the inside feelin' mighty sick. Sleep is what I wanted, you know what I got. Wide awake.... Dogs have it made, lyin' round in the shade. Never have to worry about get there on time. I can't help but wonder what was on your mind. Ridin' round in the pouring rain, havin a heck of time. Livin' may be easy, dyin' may be hard. But I'm wide awake stayin' up late, sendin' my regards. The Byrds ""Ballad Of Easy Rider"". Columbia Records 1969"
fifth dimension,"5d (Fifth Dimension). The Byrds. Oh, how is it that I could come out to you,. And be still floatin',. And never hit bottom but keep falling through,. Just relaxed and paying attention?. All my two-dimensional boundaries were gone,. I had lost to them badly,. I saw that world crumble and thought I was dead,. But I found my senses still working.. And as I continued to drop through the hole,. I found all surrounding,. To show me that joy innocently is,. Just be quiet and feel it around you.. (Bridge). And I opened my heart to the whole universe,. And I found it was loving,. And I saw the great blunder my teachers had made,. Scientific delirium madness.. I will keep falling as long as I live,. Ah, without ending,. And I will remember the place that is now,. That has ended before the beginning .... Oh, how is it that I could come out to you,. And be still floatin',. And never hit bottom but keep falling through,. Just relaxed and paying attention?"
for free,"Written by Joni Mitchell. I slept last night in a good hotel. I went shopping today for jewels. The wind rushed around the dirty room. And the children let out from their schools. I was standing on a noisy corner. Waiting for the walking green. Across the street he stood. And he played real good. On his clarinet, for free. Now me I play for fortune. And those velvet curtain calls. I've got a black limousine. And two ladies. Escorting me to the halls. And I play if you have the money. Or if you're a friend to me. But the one man band. By the quick lunch stand. He was playing real good, for free. Nobody stopped to hear him. Though he played so sweet and high. They knew he had never. Been on the TV screen. So they passed his music by. I meant to go over and ask for a song. Maybe put on a harmony. I heard his refrain. As the signal changed. He was still playing real good, for free. ."
for me again,"The moon can light the sky at night for me again. The sun can make the daytime bright and fun again. And my heart can be free the way it wants to be. 'cause you come back to me again. The wind blows pain and clouds of rain away again. And lets me stay with just a happy day again. 'cause now I really see how much you do love me. How good the world can be again. Oh, when you left that day I forgot how to care. And I hid myself away but now since you are here. Winter days will seem like spring to me again. With all the love that you will bring to me again. No matter what I'll do, I will always see it through. 'cause I won't be without you again"
full circle,"Full Circle (Clark). Funny how the circle turns around first your up and then your down again. Though the circle takes what it may give. Each time around it makes you live again.

To only pass the time. No more electric trains. No more trees to climb. But thinking young and growing older is no sin. And I can play the game of life to win. I can recall a time. When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend. Now I think I've got. A lot more than just my toys to lend. Now there's more to do. Than watch my sailboat glide. But every day can be. A magic carpet ride. A little bit of courage is all we lack. So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back. La la la la la, etc. Now there's more to do. Than watch my sailboat glide. But every day can be.

gunga din,"Written by Gene Parsons. I'm writing this here letter from aboard a DC8. Heading into Angel Town, I hope it's not too late. It rained in New York City. Mister Rock 'n' Roll couldn't stay. The crowd was mad and we were had. Chasing the sun back to L.A.. Have breakfest with me mamma. I hope they'll let us in. Got a leather jacket on. I know that it's a sin. Gunga Din. Sitting backwards on this airplane, is bound to make me sick. Spend your life on a DC8, never get to bed. Settle down (settle down). Now we're over Kansas, where the clouds are floating by.

have you seen her face,"Have you seen her face?. With her eyes reflect. The colors in the sky. On one familiar place. To be swept into. Whenever she's close by. Makes me wonder why. Run by, don't turn back. Can't hide from the look in her eye. Must be the way she walks. A style made up to capture all ahe needs. No time to spend on this talk. If your luck runs dry. She might see you tonight. Everything inside (in sight???). Run by, don't turn back. Can't hide from the look in her eye. Run by, don't turn back. Can't hide from the look in her eye. You'll find you're locked in her spell. All the sights and sounds. Your senses will be found. And only time will tell. How much love can be. To wait so patiently. Wait and see. Run by, don't turn back. Can't hide from the look in her eye."
he was a friend of mine,"Traditional with additional lyrics by Jim McGuinn. He was a friend of mine. He was a friend of mine. His killing had no purpose. No reason, or rhyme. He was a friend of mine. He was in Dallas town. He was in Dallas town. Form a sixth floor window. A gunner shot him down. He died in Dallas town. He never knew my name. He never knew my name. Though I never met him. I knew him just the same. Oh, he was a friend of mine."
here without you,Daytime just makes me feel lonely. At night I can only dream about you. Girl you're on my mind. Nearly all of the time. It's so hard being here without you.. Words in my head keep repeating. Things that you said when I was with you.. And I wonder is it true. Do you feel the same way too. It's so hard being here without you. Being here without you. Oh I know this won't last. I'll see you someday. It seems as though that day will come never. But there's one thing I'll swear. Though you're far away. I'll be thinking about you forever. Streets that I walk on depress me. Ones that were happy when I was with you. Still with all the friends I know. And with all the things I do. It's so hard being here without you. Being here without you.. Thanks to Irene for the corrections!.

hickory wind,"Written by Parsons/Buchanan. In South Carolina, there're many tall pines. I remember the oak tree that we used to climb. But now when I'm lonesome I always pretend. That I'm headin' the field of hickory wind. I started out younger, had most everything. All the riches and pleasures, what else can life bring?. But it makes me feel better each time you begin. Callin' me home, hickory wind. It's a hard way to find out that trouble is real. In a faraway city with a faraway feel. But it makes me feel better each time you begin. Callin' me home, hickory wind. Keeps callin' me home, hickory wind."
hungry planet,"Written by Skip Battin, Kim Fowley, and Roger McGuinn. I'm a hungry planet. I had a youthful face. They were in a hurry. To go to outer space. They needed bombs and tungsten. Ore and iron too. So they climbed and they dug and they blew. Divided me right in two. I'm a hungry planet. Orbiting in the sky. The things they did to hurt me. Pass on by and by. Now here I am all alone. They never ever learn. Well I had to shake and quake. And make their houses burn. I'm a hungry planet. I had the bluest seas. Oh the people kept choppin' down. All my finest trees. Poisonin' my oxygen. Diggin' into my skin. Takin' more out of my good earth. Than they'll ever put back in. I'm a hungry planet."
i am a pilgrim,"Arranged by McGuinn/Hillman. I am a pilgrim and a stranger. Travelling through this wearisome land. I've got a home in that yonder city, good Lord. And it's not, not made by hand. I've got a mother, sister and a brother. Who have gone this way before. I am determined to go and see them, good Lord. For they're on that other shore. I'm goin' down to the river of Jordan. Just to bathe my wearisome soul. If I can just touch the hem of his garment, good Lord. Then I know he'd take me home. I am a pilgrim and a stranger. Travelling through this wearisome land. I've got a home in that yonder city, good Lord. And it's not, not made by hand."
i come and stand at every door,"I come and stand at every door. But no one hears my silent prayer. I knock and yet remain unseen. For I am dead, for I am dead. I'm only seven although I died. In Hiroshima long ago. I'm seven now as I was then. When children die they do not grow. My hair was scorched by swirling flame. My eyes grew dim my eyes grew blind. Death came and turned my bones to dust. And that was scattered by the wind. I need no fruit I need no rice. I need no sweets nor even bread. I ask for nothing for myself. For I am dead, for I am dead. All that I ask for is for peace. You fight today, you fight today. So that the children of this world. May live and grow and laugh and play"

i see you,"Written by McGuinn-Crosby. I see you. Under there behind your hair. Everywhere, I see you. I see you. Turned on eyes can't tell lies. Empathise, I see you. Warm sliding sun through the cave of your hair. Wind washing fields kind of space living there. I see you. I know you. Met before, seventh floor. First world war, I know you. Who lives there?. Tell old fair I'm aware. That she cares, who lives there?. Green specks bright spiralling out in the sky. Catch my mind, turn my head, have to look, don't know why. Who lives there?. We thought how. For a while they just smile. Just a silent thought. I see you. Sun is there behind your hair. Everywhere, I see you. I see you. Many thanks to Christian Henriksson for the above lyrics!."

I've got obligations, and I intend to face 'em and take my stand. Oh, it's so hard being human, with all the troubles in sight. But somehow I know. that everything's gonna work out all right. Stick by me baby, in spite of my thoughts. that's all I want you to do, and try to help me when I'm down. and I'll take good care of you. Now I want to thank you for all the gentle loving that you give. it brightens my feelings and gives me the strength I need to live. Oh it's so hard being human, with all of the troubles in sight.

"it's all over now, baby blue","IT'S ALL OVER NOW, BABY BLUE (Bob Dylan). . You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last.. But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.. Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,. Crying like a fire in the sun.. Look out the saints are comin' through. And it's all over now, Baby Blue.. The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.. Take what you have gathered from coincidence.. The empty-handed painter from your streets. Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.. This sky, too, is folding under you. And it's all over now, Baby Blue.. All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.. All your reindeer armies, are all going home.. The lover who just walked out your door. Has taken all his blankets from the floor.. The carpet, too, is moving under you. And it's all over now, Baby Blue.. Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.. Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.. The vagabond who's rapping at your door. Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.. Strike another match, go start anew. And it's all over now, Baby Blue.. Outtake from The Byrds ""Turn!Turn! Turn!"". Columbia Records 1965.

"it's alright, ma (i'm only bleeding)","It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) ( Bob Dylan ). Darkness at the break of. noon. Shadows even the silver. spoon. The handmade blade, the. child's balloon. Eclipses both the sun and. moon. To understand you know. too soon. There is no sense in. trying.. Pointed threats, they. bluff with scorn. Suicide remarks are torn. From the fool's gold. mouthpiece. The hollow horn plays. wasted words. Proves to warn. That he not busy being. born. Is busy dying.. Temptation's page flies. out the door. You follow, find yourself. at war. Watch waterfalls of pity. roar. You feel to moan but. unlike before. You discover. That you'd just be. One more person crying.. So don't fear if you hear. A foreign sound to your. ear. It's alright, Ma, I'm. only sighing.. As some warn victory,. some downfall. Private reasons great or. small. Can be seen in the eyes. of those that call. To make all that should. be killed to crawl. While others say don't. hate nothing at all. Except hatred.. Disillusioned words like. bullets bark. As human gods aim for. their mark. Made everything from toy. guns that spark. To flesh-colored Christs. that glow in the dark. It's easy to see without. looking too far. That not much. Is really sacred.. While preachers preach of. evil fates. Teachers teach that. knowledge waits. Can lead to. Goodness hides behind its. gates. But even the president of. the United States. Sometimes must have. To stand naked.. An' though the rules of. the road have been lodged. It's only people's games. that you got to dodge. And it's alright, Ma, I. can make it.. Advertising signs that. con you. Into thinking you're the. one. That can do what's never. been done. That can win what's never. been won. Meantime life outside. goes on. All around you.. You lose yourself, you. reappear. You suddenly find you got. nothing to fear. Alone you stand with. nobody near. When a trembling distant. voice, unclear. Startles your sleeping. ears to hear. That somebody thinks. They really found you.. A question in your nerves. is lit. Yet you know there is no. answer fit to satisfy. Insure you not to quit. To keep it in your mind. and not forget. That it is not he or she. or them or it. That you belong to.. Although the masters make. the rules. For the wise men and the. fools. I got nothing, Ma, to. live up to.. For them that must obey. authority. That they do not respect. in any degree. Who despise their jobs,. their destinies. Speak jealously of them. that are free. to be. Nothing more than. something. They invest in.. While some on principles. baptized. To strict party platform. ties. Social clubs in drag. Outsiders they can freely. criticize. Tell nothing except who. to idolize. And then say God bless. him.. While one who sings with. his tongue on fire. Gargles in the rat race. choir. Bent out of shape from. society's pliers. Cares not to come up any. higher. But rather get you down. in the hole. That he's in.. But I mean no harm nor. put fault. On anyone that lives in a. vault. But it's alright, Ma, if. I can't please him.. Old lady judges watch. people in pairs. Limited in sex, they dare. To push fake morals,. insult and stare. While money doesn't talk,. it swears.

jack tarr the sailor,"Jack Tarr The Sailor (McGuinn). . When first I came to Liverpool I went upon the spree. Me money at last I spent it fast got drunk as drunk could be. And when my money was all gone it was then that I wanted more. But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more. I spent the night with Angeline to drunk to roll in bed. Me watch it was new and my money was too. And the morning with them she fled. And as I roamed the streets of Bath the whores they all would roar. There goes Jarr Tarr the poor sailor. He must go to sea once more. As I walking down the steet I ran into Rapper Brown. I asked him for to take me in and he looked at me with a frown. He said last time you was on board with me you job no score. But I'll take your advance and I'll give you the chance. And I'll send you to sea once more. They shipped me aboard of a whaling ship bound for the Artic Sea. Where the cold winds blow thru the frost and the snow. Jamaica rum would freeze. A'las I had no luck with my gear for I left my money ashore. It was then that I wished that I was there safe with the girl's ashore. Come all ye boat seafaring lads who listen to my song.

But get married lads and have all night in and go to to sea no more. . The Byrds ""Ballad Of Easy Rider"". Columbia Records 1969"

Hiding from the children so they would not tell. We would stay there 'till her sister rang the evening bell. Jamaica, say you will. Help me find a way to fill these empty hours. Say you will come again tomorrow. The daughter of a captain on the rolling seas. She would stare across the water from the trees. Last time he was home he held her on his knees. And said the next time they would sail away just where they pleased. Jamaica, say you will. Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails. And stay until my ships can find the sea. Jamaica was a sweet young one, I loved her true. She was a comfort and a mercy through and through. Hiding from this world together, next thing I knew. We had brought her things down to the bay -- what could I do. Jamaica, say you will. Help me find a way to fill these sails. And we will sail until our waters have run dry.

just a season,"Written by Roger McGuinn and Jacques Levy. If all my days was hills to climb and circles without reason. If all I was was passing time, my life was just a season. Dares and dreams and silly schemes and fillies running freely. I was young and no song was sung that didn't sound appealing. I'd have my fun with a shy girl and maybe hop a train. And I'd look back at her standing in the rain. Dirty hands and root beer stands and money like a river. Making deals to see how it feels to get more than you're giving. I'd have my fun with a gamblin man and bluff him with my face. And it's drinks for everybody in the place. If all my days was hills to climb and circles without reason. If all I was was passing time my life was just a season. If all my days was hills to climb and circles without reason. If all I was was passing time my life was just a season. Shouting crowds and mummer's shrouds and people going crazy. Always said what was in their heads it surely was amazing. I had my fun in the bull ring and never got a scar. It really wasn't hard to be a star. If all my days was hills to climb and circles without reason. If all I was was passing time my life was just a season."

kathleen's song,"Written by Roger McGuinn and Jacques Levy. When I awake you will be gone. Shady tomorrow. I want to go where will you be. So I'll stay home letting my hair grow long. And I will be waiting for you. While fire burns summer is gone. Winter is sorrow. And time don't mean nothing to me. When only the owls (hours??) listen to hear my songs. And I will be walking in dew. And I will be waiting for you. Some people say love goes away. Not mine. A rose is left for your cheeks. I will borrow. And find a place for you to see. A sash of blue tells me your love is strong. Each spring my life, starting anew. And I will be waiting for you."

lay down your weary tune,"Written by Bob Dylan. Lay down your weary tune, lay down. Lay down the song you strum. And rest yourself beneath the strength of strings. No voice can hope to hum. Sruck by the sounds before the sun. I knew the night had gone. The morning breeze like a bugle blew. Against the drums of dawn. Lay down your weary tune, lay down. Lay down the song you strum. And rest yourself beneath the strength of strings. No voice can hope to hum. The ocean wild like an organ played. The seaweed wove its strands. The crashin' waves like cymbals clashed. Against the rocks and sands. Lay down your weary tune, lay down. Lay down the song you strum. And rest yourself beneath the strength of strings. No voice can hope to hum. The last of leaves fell from the trees. And clung to a new love's breast. The branches bare like a banjo played. To the winds that listened best. Lay down your weary tune, lay down. Lay down the song you strum. And rest yourself beneath the strength of strings. No voice can hope to hum."

my back pages,"Written by Bob Dylan. Crimson flames tied through my years. Rollin high and mighty trapped. Countless violent flaming roads. Using ideas as my map. ""We'll meet on edges soon"" said I. Proud 'neath heated brow. Ah but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. Half wracked prejudice leaped forth. ""Rip down all hate"" I screamed. Lies that life is black and white. Spoke from my skull. I dreamed. Romantic flanks of musketeers. Foundationed deep, somehow. Ah but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand. At the mongrel dogs who teach. Fearing not I'd become my enemy. In the instant that I preach. Sisters fled by confusion boats. Mutiny from stern to bow. Ah but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. My guard stood hard when abstract threats. Too noble to neglect. Deceived me into thinking. I had something to protect. Good and bad I define these terms. Quite clear, no doubt, somehow. Ah but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now."

Nothing was delivered Just what you had in mind. When you made everybody pay. Now I hope you won't object to this. Giving back all of what you owe. And the sooner you come up with them. The sooner you can leave. Nothing is better, nothing is best. Take care of your health and get plenty of rest. Nothing was delivered. But I can't say I sympathise. With what your fate is going to be. Yes, for telling all those lies. No, nothing was delivered. Yes, and someone must explain. That as long as it takes to do this. Then that's how long you'll remain. Nothing is better, nothing is best. Take care of your health and get plenty of rest."

Was in the town of Shawnee on a Saturday afternoon. His wife beside him in a wagon as into town they rode. And along come a deputy sheriff in a manner rather rude. Using vulgar words of language and his wife she overheard. And Pretty Boy Floyd grabbed a long chain, and the deputy grabbed a gun. And in the fight that followed, he laid that deputy down. Then he ran through the trees and bushes and lived a life of shame. Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name. He ran through trees and bushes on the Canadian River shore. And many a starving farmer opened up his door. It was in Oklahoma City, It was on a Christmas Day. A whole carload of groceries and a letter that did say. Well you say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief. Well, here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief. As through this life you travel, you meet some funny men. Some rob you with a six-gun, some with a fountain pen. As through this life you ramble, as through this life you roam. You'll never see an outlaw take a family from their home."

satisfied mind,How many times have you heard someone say. If I had his money I'd do things my way. But little they know that it's so hard to find. One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind. For money can't buy back your youth when you're old. Or a friend when you're lonely or a heart that's grown cold. The wealthiest person is a pauper at times. Compared to the man with a satisfied mind. Once I was living in fortune and fame. I had all that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game. Then suddenly it happened and I lost every dime. But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

When the galaxy was young. they looked upon the earth. and saw that its position. was promising for birth. They searched for life. but finding none they left a beacon bright. Its signal had not been disturbed. in the eternal light. How wise they were to choose this place. they knew when we arrived. That our atomic energy. we'd harnessed and survived.

tiffany queen,"Written by Roger McGuinn. Happiness hit me on the first day that we met. She was sitting in my kitchen with a face I can't forget. She was looking my direction and calling with her eyes. I was trying to do an interview and telling them all lies. Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head. They were asking what I thought about the 50's rock n roll. Then they got into their limousine and fell into a hole. I moved into the kitchen and I quickly fell in love. The warden came along and asked me what I was thinking of. Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head. Well I grabbed her by the hand and with a few things I could. The warden said ""You're leaving, well, you better leave for good!"". I made it to Tasmania to buy a devil dog. We were met by a young handsome prince, who turned into a frog. Last year in the summer with a tiffany lamp over her head. Now we're living out in Malibu the ocean by our side. Laying in the sunshine drifting with the tide.

Saying to me what can we do now that we both love you. I love you too. And I don't really see. Why can't we go on as three. You are afraid, embarrassed too. No one has ever said such a thing to you. Your mother's ghost stands at your shoulders. A face like ice, a little bit colder. Saying to you, you cannot do that. It breaks all the rules, you learned in school. But I don't really see. Why can't we go on as three. We love each other, it's plain to see. There's just one answer that comes to be. Sister lovers, water brothers, and in time maybe others.

This is the last time we can meet"". With her hair piled up high and a look in her eye. That would turn any good man's blood to wine. All his eyes could see, well all his eyes could see. Was the stare from all those around him. He ran out to the lot, and climbed into his rig. And drove off without tightening down. It was a terrilble thing, to see what remained. Of the rig that poor Danny was in. And he was so young and on a ten city run. In love with a truck stop girl. But he was so young, and on a ten city run. In love with a truck stop girl."

wait and see,Watch out what you say. ...............in my way. I'm gonna get that girl. Wait and see. I saw her today. She came by my way. I'm gonna win her love. Just for me. And together we'll go walking. In the evening still be talking. She's the kind of girl you never.... Have you seen her eyes. Do you realize. How much a love like that can mean to me. I know she knows me. Today I could see. The way she.......her head when she walked by. And before the night is over. I think I'm gonna love her. And if it lasts forever I don't care. And now she is mine. I told you all the time. How could I let a girl like that go by. And before the night is over. I think I'm gonna love her. And if it lasts forever I don't care.
wasn't born to follow,"Oh I'd rather go and journey where the diamond crest is flowing and. Run across the valley beneath the sacred mountain and. Wander through the forest. Where the trees have leaves of prisms and break the light in colors. That no one knows the names of. And when it's time I'll go and wait beside a legendary fountain. Till I see your form reflected in it's clear and jewelled waters. And if you think I'm ready. You may lead me to the chasm where the rivers of our vision. Flow into one another. I will want to die beneath the white cascading waters. She may beg, she may plead, she may argue with her logic. And then she'll know the things I learned. That really have no value in the end she will surely know. I wasn't born to follow"

She don't believe you, she don't think that's where it's at. Why?. Why?. Say she can't change that, it's the way you've always done it. She don't care about that, she thinks you've just begun it.

I've been beaten by the wind and robbed by the sleet. Had my head stove in and I'm still on my feet and I'm willin' to be movin'. And I smuggled some smokes for folks in Mexico. Baked by the sun every time I go to Mexico and I'm still willin'. I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari to Tehachapi to Tonopah. Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made. I've driven on the back roads so I won't get weighed. You give me weed whites and wine and show me a sign. Well, I'll be willin' to be movin"

Tomorrow's the day. My bride's gonna come. Oh, Oh are we gonna fly. Down in the easy chair. I don't care. How many letters they send. Morning came and morning went. Pack up your money. Pick up your tent. You ain't goin nowhere. Whoo-ee ride me high. Tomorrow's the day. My bride's gonna come. Oh, Oh are we gonna fly. Down in the easy chair. Buy me a flute. And a gun that shoots. Tailgates and substitutes. Strap yourself. To a tree with roots. You ain't goin nowhere. Whoo-ee ride me high. Tomorrow's the day. My bride's gonna come. Oh, Oh are we gonna fly. Down in the easy chair. Now Genghis Kahn. He could not keep. All his kings. Supplied with sleep. We'll climb that hill no matter how steep. When we get up to it. Whoo-ee ride me high.

you all look alike,"You All Look Alike (Battin/Fowley). Starlight crossed my eyes, she took me by surprise. Said you'd come to town, last summer brought me down. I said I'd never seen the likes of you before. She pulled a gun and not in fun I'm dyin' on the floor. You all look alike, I'm sorry I don't know. You all look alike, we never met before. Now matter how I try to say I've never been down this way. Said I couldn't be fair cause you all look alike. Lyin' here and dyin' here I'm trying to get my strength. It's so hard to get on back when you're lyin' at full length. All the crowds and all the dogs from miles around just stare. They looked at me and shed a tear, I'm glad those people care.

My pockets are empty, my last drink of wine,. An empty bottle of broken hearts. and you're still on my mind. Alone and forsaken, so blue I could die.

your gentle way of loving me,"Your Gentle Way Of Loving Me (Gary Paxton/Gib Guilbeau). It's the humming of the engines of the greyhound bus and trains. that keeps your memory on my mind and here with me. Many miles have come between us, cold nights on some roadside.

Some little girl as I walk by just looking at me sadly. bringin' back your gentle ways of loving me. It's just your gentle way of loving me. It's just your gentle way of loving me.
