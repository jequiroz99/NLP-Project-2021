cold day in the sun,"Take a high dive into your brain. And make your only cost. You just might wear your welcome out if you don't let it go.. And there's nothing that you couldn't say. Cause you said it all before. Think it's time you walk this lonely road all on your own. It's your cold day in the sun. Looks like you're bleeding heart. Has already won. Wish I could take it away. And save you from yourself. You get so lost inside your head like no one else. Looking for someone to blame. Blame me all along. You'll take the heat, but you would never take the fall.

come alive,"Seems like only yesterday. Life belonged to runaways. Nothing here to see, no looking back. Every sound monotone. Every color monochrome. Life began to fade into the black. Such a simple animal. Sterilized with alcohol. I could hardly feel me anymore. Desperate meaningless. All filled up with emptiness. Felt like everything was said and done. I lay there in the dark I closed my eyes. You saved me the day you came alive. Still I tried to find my way. Spinning I was in a daze. Burning like a flame behind my eyes. Drown it out drink it in. Crown the king of suffering. Prisoner slave to the disguise. Disappear the only thing. Bittersweet surrendering. Knew that it was time to say goodbye. I lay there in the dark I closed my eyes. You saved me the day you came alive. No reason left for me to survive. You saved me the day you came alive. Come alive. I lay there in the dark I close my eyes. You saved me the day you came alive. Come alive. Nothing more to give. I can finally live. Come alive. Your life into me. I can finally breathe. Come alive. I lay there in the dark. Open my eyes. You saved me the day that you came alive. Come alive"
come back,Moving again. Comfort of the chase. Now and again. This my saving grace. Dead on the inside I've got nothing to prove. Keep me alive and give me something to lose. Goodbye.

concrete and gold,"You lost your mind. I could not go. What little time we spent. A penny on the floor. My desperation. A spinning top. Revolving on and on. A world that never stops. Is it all mine?. How could I know?. We threw the rind away. Swallowed all the core. Tried levitation. You're not alone. The stars are holding open. A door we'll never close. I have an engine made of gold. Something so beautiful. The world will never know. Our roots are stronger than you know. Up through the concrete we will grow. Is it all mine?. I can't let go. What little time we spent. A penny on the floor. My desparation. Is this a curse?. 'Til death do us part. For better or for worse. I have an engine made of gold. Something so beautiful. The world will never know. Our roots are stronger than you know. Up through the concrete we will grow. Our roots are stronger than you know. Up through the concrete we will grow. (Fuck you, Darrell)"
congregation,"I met the seventh son. He came for everyone. The day he heard the lightning in the field. I heard him clear his throat. The fork within the road. That night that Tallahatchie took the wheel. I've been throwing knives. To see just where they'll land. Now my world is in your hands. Send in the congregation. Open your eyes, step in the light. A jukebox generation. Just as you were. The voice upon the stage. Is the heart inside a cage. And it's singing like a bluebird in the round. There's mystery in this wood. And ghosts within these roots. And it tangled deep beneath this southern ground. I've been going through life. Making foolish plans. Now my world is in your hands. Send in the congregation. Open your eyes, step in the light. A jukebox generation. Just as you were, right?. Just as you were. Just as you were, alright. And you need blind faith. No false hope, no false hope. Do you have blind faith?. No false hope, no false hope. Where is your blind faith?. No false hope, no false hope. Open your eyes, open your eyes. Step into the light. Open your eyes, step into the light. The sound becomes congregation. Congregation. Congregation. And they're singing like a bluebird in the round"
d.o.a.,"You know I did it. It's over and I feel fine. Nothing you can say's gonna change my mind. Waited and I waited the longest night. Nothing like the taste of sweet decline. I went down, I fell, I fell so fast.. Dropping like the grains in an hourglass. Never say forever, cause nothing lasts. Dancing with the bones to my buried past. Nevermind, there's nothing I can do. Bet your life there's something killing you. Chorus:. It's a shame we have to die, my dear. No one's getting out of here alive. this time What a way to go, but have no fear. No one's getting out of here alive this time. I'm finished. I'm getting you off my chest. Made you come clean in a dirty dress. A promise is a promise. You're kept in check. Hard to cross a heart that beats it's fists. Take a good hard look for the very last time. The very last one in a very long line. Only took a second to say goodbye. Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine. Ain't no way. D.O.A.. It's a shame we have to die, my dear. No one's getting out of here alive this time. What a way to go, but have no fear.

good grief,"Since I'm putting down all. Of the true things around, but I like it. I handed down the crown. Given the jewels and the answers of may. The thought of being ousted comes and goes. When I think about it the wind blows. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Run me out of town. Somewhere a move might intended a gown at. Pissed at all the bowels. Always the blues and a delicate smile. Missed all of the sideways. Gull and noun. Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around. Good grief. Since I'm putting down all. Of the true things around, but I like it. I handed down the crown. Given the jewels and the answers of may. The thought of being ousted comes and goes. When I think about it the wind blows.

And the morning had died. The millions knew that there was no lie. Temple was built and the worshiping showed. Made of iron and of stone

A palm upturned burnt blue.. Don't call it sunburn.. You've been shaking on the job.. Just one drink ahead of your past.. There's a white light coming up.. You draw the blinds hoping it'll pass.. I kissed the bottle.. I should've been kissing you.. You wake up to an empty night.. With tears for two.. I kissed the bottle.. I should've been kissing you.. You wake up to an empty night.. With tears for two.. I kissed the bottle.. I should've been kissing you.. You wake up to an empty night.. With tears for two."

Are you there?. I don't feel you anymore. Are you there?. Will you give in?. Are you there?. If I give out. Over and out. Cages and alarms. Keeping us from harm. I will be the guard.

requiem,Man watchin' video. The heart keeps on tickin'. He doesn't know why. He's just cattle for slaughter. The requiem. When the meaningful words. when they cease to function. when there's nothing to say. when will they start plotting against you. Only a hint of religion. I'm sensing spirits of depravity. the sound of breaking glass. this is the reflection
resolve,Something that I felt today. Something that I heard. Swinging from the chandelier. Hanging on your word. I remember watching you. Once upon a time. Dancing from across the room. In another life. A little bit of resolve. Is what I need now. Pin me down. Show me how. Looking back to find my way. Never seemed so hard. Yesterday’s been laid to rest. Changing of the guard. I would never change a thing. Even if I could. All the songs we used to sing. Everything was good. One more year that you’re not here. Has gone and passed you by. What happened to you?. One more tear that you won’t hear. Has gone and passed you by. What happened to you?. . (fonte: site oficial)
rock and roll,"It's been a long time since I rock and rolled. It's been a long time since I did the Stroll. Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back, let me get it back. Baby, where I come from. It's been a long time, been a long time. Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. Yes it has. It's been a long time since the book of love. I can't count the tears of a life with no love. Carry me back, carry me back. Carry me back, baby, where I come from. It's been a long time, been a long time. Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight. Making vows that just can't work right. Open your arms, opens your arms. Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in. It's been a long time, been a long time. Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time"

the one,Everyone makes one mistake. One more time for old times sake. One more time before the feeling fades. One less born of memories. One more bruise you gave to me. One more test just how much can i take?. You're not the one but your the only one who could. make me feel like this. You're not the one but your the only one who could. make me feel like this. Something never meant to be. Everything you meant to me. Wake me when this punishment is done. Those who try and get away. From the one who gets away. Someone's always someone else's one. You're not the one but you the only one who could make. me feel like this. You're not the one but you the only one who can make. me feel like this. x2. Until the end of time. In another life. Till the day i die. Save it up for one more try. Save it for the last goodbye. We go ON. and get OFF. and get ON. and get OFF. You're not the one but your the only one who could. make me feel like this. You're not the one but your the only one who can make. me feel like this. x4. . (Orange County Soundtrack)

Set me free again. You keep alive a moment at a time. But still inside a whisper to a riot. To sacrifice but knowing to survive. The first to climb another state of mind. I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign. Forever, whenever, I never wanna die. I never wanna die, I never wanna die. I'm on my knees, I never wanna die. I'm dancing on my grave, I'm running through the fire. Forever, whenever, I never wanna die. I never wanna leave, I'll never say goodbye. Forever, whenever, forever, whenever.

And if it has no end. The lonely heart that learns. Over and over again. I ride the wheel that turns. When all is dead and gone. And the air we breathe is not enough. To keep these dying arms, see them. Carry on into the sun, into the sun. I'm not the only one. I'm not the only one. Heaven skies are reeling. And my hand that holds the world. Deep inside i'm reaching. Into the universe. Over and over again. I ride the wheel that turns. Over and over again. i find the soul that burns. And if it has no end. The lonely heart that learns. Over and over again. I ride the wheel that turns. Oh, oh, oh. Oh-oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Over and over again. I ride the wheel that turns. Over and over again. i find the soul that burns. And if it has no end. The lonely heart that learns. Over and over again. I ride the wheel that turns. Oh, oh, oh. Oh-oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Over and over again. I ride the wheel that turns. Over and over again. i find the soul that burns"
x-static,"Leading everything along, never far from being wrong.. Nevermind these things at all, it's nothing.. Couldn't find a way to you, seems that's all I ever do.. Turning up in black and blue, rewarded.. All the static we all left.. Wait 'til the time has come, figure that's where time comes from.. Leaving all my senses numb, is heaven.. Lifted up the fay to seen, anything could never be.. Anything but play to me, in order.. All the static we all left.. Take it back for them to keep, fallen into something deep.. Not that I had made that leap, annointed.. All the static we all left.. Where have all the wishes gone, now that all of that is done?. Wish I would've felt I've won, for once.."
