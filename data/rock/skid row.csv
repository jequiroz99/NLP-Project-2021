i remember you,"Woke up to soothing sound of pouring rain. The wind would whisper and I'd think of you. And all the tears you cried. That called my name. And when you needed me I came through.. I paint a picture of the days gone by. When love went blind and you would make me see. I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes. So that I knew that you were there for me. Time after time, you were there for me. Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand. Love letters in the sand, I remember you. Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day. I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you. We spent the summer with the top rolled down. Wished ever after would be like this. You said ""I love you babe,"" without a sound. I said I'd give up my life for just one kiss. I'd live for your smile, and die for your kiss. Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand. Love letters in the sand, I remember you. Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day. I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you. We've had our share of hard times. But that's the price we paid. And through it all, we kept the promise that we made. I swear you'll never be lonely. Woke up to soothing sound of pouring rain. Washed away a dream of you. But nothing else could ever take you away. 'cause you'll always be my dream come true. Oh my darling, I love you. Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand. Love letters in the sand, I remember you. Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day. I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you. Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand. Love letters in the sand, I remember you. Through all the sleepless nights, through every endless day. I'd wanna hear you say. I remember, I remember you. Ohhh uhhh yeah"
18 and life,"Ricky was a young boy. He had a heart of stone. Lived nine to five. and worked his fingers to the bone. Just barely out of school, came from the edge of town. Fought like a switchblade. so no one could take him down. He had no money, ooh no good at home. He walked the streets a soldier. and he fought the world alone. And now it's. 18 and life You got it. 18 and life you know. Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go. Tequila in his heartbeat. His veins burned gasoline. It kept his motor running. but it never kept him clean. They say he loved adventure, ""Ricky's the wild one. "". He married trouble had a courtship with a gun. Bang Bang Shoot 'em up, The party never ends. You can't think of dying. when the bottle's your best friend. And now it's. 18 and life You got it. 18 and life you know. Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go. ""Accidents will happen"" they all heard Ricky say.

wasted time,"You and I together in our lives. Sacred ties would never fray. Then why can't I let myself tell lies. And watch you die every day. I think back to the times. When dreams were what mattered. Tough talking youth naivete. You said you'd never let me down. But the horse stampedes and rages. In the name of desperation. Is it all just wasted time. Can you look at yourself. When you think of what. You left behind. Is it all just wasted time. Can you live with yourself. When you think of what. You've left behind. Paranoid delusions they haunt you. Where's my friend I used to know. He's all alone. He's buried deep within a carcass. Searching for a soul. Can you feel me inside your heart. As it's bleeding. Why can't you believe you can't be loved. I hear you scream in agony. And the horse stampedes and rages. In the name of desperation. Is it all just wasted time. Can you look at yourself. When you think of what. You left behind. Is it all just wasted time. Can you live with yourself. When you think of what. You've left behind. You said you'd never let me down. But the horse stampedes, it rages. In the name of desperation. Is it all just wasted time. Can you look at yourself. When you think of what. You left behind. Is it all just wasted time. Can you live with yourself. When you think of what. You've left behind. The sun will rise again. The earth will turn to sand. Creation's colors seem to fade to grey. And you'll see the sickly hands of time. Will write your final rhyme. And end a memory. I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy"
in a darkened room,"In a darkened room. Beyond the reach of God's faith. Lies the wounded, the shattered remains of love betrayed. And the innocence of a child is bought and sold. In the name of the damned. The rage of the angels left silent and cold. Forgive me please for I know not what I do. How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true. (Chorus). Tell me when the kiss of love becomes a lie. That bears the scar of sin too deep. To hide behind this fear of running unto you. Please let there be light. In a darkened room.... All the precious times have been put to rest again. And the smile of the dawn. Brings tainted lust singing my requiem. Can I face the day when I'm tortured in my trust. And watch it crystallize. While my salvation crumples to dust. Why can't I steer the ship before it hits the storm. I've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shore. (Chorus 2x). Tell me when the kiss of love becomes a lie. That bears the scar of sin too deep. To hide behind this fear of running unto you. Please let there be light.... In a darkened room!"
youth gone wild,"Rollin'. Woah yeah... Since I was born,. They couldn't hold me down. Another misfit kid,. Another burned-out town. I never played by the rules and I never really cared,. My nasty reputation takes me everywhere. Well I look n' see it's not only me. So many others have stood where I stand,. We are the young - so raise your hands. (Chorus). They call us problem child,. We spend our lives on trial,. We walk an endless mile - we are the Youth Gone Wild. We stand and we won't fall - we're one and one for all. The writing's on the wall - we are the Youth Gone Wild. My boss screamin' my ear 'bout who I'm s'posed to be,. ""Get a three-piece Wall Street smile, and son you'll look. just like me"". I said ""Hey, man, there's somethin' you oughta know, well I tell ya Park Avenue leads to...Skid Row!!"". Well I look n' see it's not only me. We're standing tall, ain't never a doubt. We are the young, so shout it out. (repeat chorus). Well lemme hear ya get wild!. (guitar solo). (repeat chrorus). (typical Bach-style screaming to fade). We are the Youth Gone Wild!"
quicksand jesus,"She caught the melting sky.. It burned but still the winter passes by and by to the other side. A slow parade of wind that blows through trees that wilted. With the season's children. Are we saved by the words of bastard saints? Do we live in fear or faith. Tell me now who's behind the rain. A maze of tangled grace. The symptoms of ""for real"" are crumbling from embrace. But still we chase...the shadows of belief. And new religion clouds our visions of the roots of our souls. Are we ashamed of our own fate. Or play the fool for our own sake. Tell me who's behind the rain. What do we need where do we go when we get where we don't know. Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow. When faith's our shelter from the cold. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away...away. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away. Quicksand Jesus I need you. Quicksand Jesus I believe you. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away."

little wing,"Well she's walking. Through the clouds. With a circus mind. That's running wild. Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairytales. That's all she ever thinks about.

I know there’s another dick in the system. I’ve lived with angels. I’ve laid with whores. I gave you nothing but honesty. Then I licked your sores. I’m not the one to crucify.

monkey business,"Outside my window there's a. Whole lot of trouble comin'. The cartoon killers and the. Rag cover clones. Stack heals kickin' rhythm. Of social circumcision. Can't close the closet on a. Shoe box full of bones. Kangaroo lady with her bourbon in a pouch. Can't afford the rental on a bamboo couch. Collecting back her favors 'cause her well is running dry. I know her act is terminal,. But she ain't gonna die. Slim Intoxicado drinkin' dime store hooch. Is always in a circle with his part-time pooch. Little creepy's playing dollies on the New York rain. Thinkin' Bowie's just a knife. Ooh the pain. I ain't seen the sun since I don't know when. The freaks come out at nine. And it's twenty to ten. What's this funk. That you ucall junk. To me it's just monkey business. Blind man in the box that will probably die. The village kids laugh as they waalk by. A psycho is on the edge of this human garbage dump. And the vultures in the sewers are telling. Him to jump. Into the fire from the frying pan. Tripping on his tongue. For a cool place to stand. Where's this shaade. That you've got it made. To me it's just monkey business. CHORUS. Monkey business. Slippin' on the track. Monkey business. Jungle in black. Ain't your business if I got. No monkey on my back. CHORUS. The Vaseline gypsies and the silicone souls. Dressed to the society. Hypocrite heartbeat and cheap alibis. Can't get you by that monkey. CHORUS."
beat yourself blind,"Give me a minute 'cause I'm wrapped in superstition. Pour me a chemical to take away the edge. Don't make up anything that's breaking all your fingers. Just slap around a bit of what it takes to pledge. Carry out another stone as a slave. Ask general-know-it-all ""Who's juggling the earth?"". Tease all the natives that will walk across your grave. And shove aside your nation all for what it's worth. (Chorus). Beat yourself blind (Repeat 6x). An open eyes and a closed mind. Look at the suit in suspended animation. A faded outline that used to be a man. A piece of paper that's fallen out a window. Has got a better chance to know where it will land. (Repeat Chorus). To bleed in vain, to bleed in vain--under my eyes are painted skies. Down at the boneyard, they're diggin' up the relics. Handfuls of parasites thrown into machines. I got the phone call they're tearin' down the mission. The zombies had a ball, but don't know what it means. Beat yourself blind."
beggar's day,"Suzi got an Uzi what a beautiful bride. That's where the trouble begun. Will there be any objection or a bloody resurrection. It's only up to Suzanne. A load of ammunition in her hand. She had 'em laughin' in the aisles. Venus Dee in the critical file. She wasn't there to pray. The killing joke had 'em laughin' all the way. All the way - all the way to Beggar's Day. She vowed to take 'em any way she can. All the way - all the way to Beggar's Day. Her jealous claim to fame has come. Now, all you beggars pay. Adam's in the chapel and he's swallowing his apple. Wearing out his ball and chain. But things were gettin' shady when the honorable maidy. Broke out the forty caliber rain. She had 'em laughin' in the aisles. Venus Dee in the critical file. She wasn't there to pray. The killing joke had 'em laughin' all the way. All the way - all the way to Beggar's Day. She vowed to take 'em any way she can. All the way - all the way to Beggar's Day. Her jealous claim to fame has come. Now, all you beggars pay"
big guns,"She was a ballerina on a subway train. Stiletto heels and a candy cane. Looked like a number on a station wall. Hot on the tail of a social call. I wet my lips I thought I had it made. Like Valentino with a hand grenade. I made my move with my libido on. She circled once and then she dropped the bomb. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Blew me away. And I went down in flames. I met a sidewalk preacher on a roller skate. He said he had the key to heaven's gate. I said: ""I'll wait for the movie 'cause I been there before"". And learned: like is a battle and love is war. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Took me by surprise. She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Blew me away. And I went down in flames. I'm doing time as a back seat Romeo. Play solitaire with my hands in the air. Another night and no bullets to spare. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Took me by surprise. She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Blew me away. And I went down in flames. Big guns (Big guns). Big guns, blew me away. And I went down in flames. Big guns, big guns. She really, really got the big guns. She shot me down in flames"
slave to the grind,"You got me forced to crack my lids in two. I'm still stuck inside the rubber room. I gotta punch the clock that leads the blind. I'm just another gear in the assembly line. oh no. The noose gets tighter. Around my throat. But I ain't at the end of my rope. 'Cause I won't be the one left behind. Can't be king of the world. If you're slave to the grind. Tear down the rat racial slime. Can't be king of the world. If you're slave to the grind.. Get it?. A routine injection, a lethal dose. But my day in the sun ain't even close. There's no need to waste your prayers on me. You better mark my words. Cause I'm history.. Yes indeed. You might beg for mercy to get by. But I'd rather tear this thorn from my side. They swallowed their daggers by turning their trick. They tore my intentions apart brick by brick. I'm sick of the jive. You talk verbal insecticide. I said slave to the grind. Slave to the grind. Slave to the grind"
forever,"Remember when we were young. Just two kids on the run. With our fists full of dreams. Took it awhile, playin' it cool. Stayed up late cuttin' school. While lightin' cigarettes, like James Dean. In the backseat of my Chevrolet. Where the radio would play and play. And all the world would fade away. CHORUS. Together we stand. Well, its just you and me. So baby, hold on and you'll see. Forever we stand. And we'll make it through. 'Cause I know that I can't live without you. No.... They said we're growin' up too fast. What we had would never last. So we left without goodbyes. And then some times, well, they got tough. Roads ahead looked kinda rough. And all we had was you and I. We prayed to God on those cold, dark nights. And then we knew that it would be alright. We'd go through hell just to hold each other tight. Together we stand. Well, its just you and me. So baby, hold on and you'll see. Forever we stand. And we'll make it through. 'Cause I know that I can't live without you. BRIDGE. As long as the world keeps turning,. As long as there's another day. Together, forever we'll stay. Yeah!. In the backseat of my Chevrolet. Where the radio would play and play. And all the world would fade away. Yeah!. Together we stand. Well, its just you and me. So baby, hold on and you'll see. Forever we stand. And we'll make it through. 'Cause I know that I can't live without you. Forever. Forever. Forever we stand. Forever. Forever. Forever we stand!."

She broke a million hearts. On 2nd Avenue. With her German cigarettes. And designer attitude. What can u do?. No, no, no, what can I do. My love's been goin' blind. Since the first time I laid eyes on you. Ain't much for conversation. But I got to let you know. Here I am. Close your eyes and I'll be Superman. Here I am. Come and take my lovin' while you can.

cats in the cradle,"My child arrived just the other day. Came to the world in the usual way. But there were planes to catch and bills to pay. He learned to walk while I was away. He was talkin' 'fore I knew it. And as he grew he said,. 'I'm gonna be like you, Dad,. You know I'm gonna be like you.'. Chorus. And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,. Little boy blue and the man 'n the moon.. 'When you comin' home?'. 'Son, I don't know when. We'll get together then.. You know we'll have a good time then.'. Well, my son turned ten just the other day.. He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play.. Could you teach me to throw?'. I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do.'. He said, 'That's okay.' And he walked away and he smiled and he. said,. 'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah.. You know I'm gonna be like him.'. Chorus. Well, he came from college just the other day,. So much like a man I just had to say,. 'I'm proud of you. Could you sit for a while?'. He shook his head and he said with a smile,. 'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.. See you later. Can I have them please ?'. Chorus. I've long since retired, my son's moved away.. I called him up just the other day.. 'I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.'. He said, 'I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.. You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,. But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.. It's been sure nice talkin' to you.'. And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,. He'd grown up just like me.. My boy was just like me.. Chorus"

sweet little sister,She blew my mind behind the wrecking machine. She was a shitload of trouble called the Subway Queen. Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene. One night I caught her running out the cellar door. There was about a million people lying flat on the floor. For such a sweet little lady I would swear she's rotten to the core. She got her hands in the cookie jar. Smiling like an alligator. Makin' headlines in the back of her car. Tight-lipped now but sink ships later. I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister. Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister. She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister. Mona Lisa with a new tattoo. She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister. Every quittin' time is another disease. Too many cowboys ridin' high shootin' low at the knees. The back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze. The pettin's getting heavy got her tongue in her ear. her friend is doing time for kickin' ass on a queer. They're in a mental state and all their friends are here. She's tellin' lies through her burgundy lips. Angel on a mission of mercy. She'll get you dancin' with the crack of her whip. Take you up to heaven in her rocket ship. I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister. Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister. She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister. Mona Lisa with a new tattoo. She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister. She got her hands in the cookie jar smiling like an alligator. Makin' headlines in the back of her car. Tight-lipped now but sink ships later. I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister. Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister. She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister. Mona Lisa with a new tattoo. She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister

disease,Have you looked at yourself lately. You see the lines of time?. Walking dead amongst the living. Chaos by design. I’ve seen you fall this far before. I’ve seen you disappear. You’ve thrown it all into the fire. Ashes in your tears. I felt your disease and now I think. I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough. I felt your disease and now I think. I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough. You’ve fallen on your sword again. So not to face the truth. Then ran head-on into what’s real. And collided into you. I’ve heard you lying to yourself. I’ve watched you fade away. Your best laid plans are still born shadows. Promise in decay. I felt your disease and now I think. I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough. I felt your disease and now I think. I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough. I felt your disease and now I think. I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough. I felt your disease and now I think. I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough. I felt your disease and now I think. I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough
psycho love,"Check out Clementine. Cleanin' needles in her wine. Face down in her one-eyed world. With her brain-dead valentine. She'll be your zombie, your livin' dead. Her sweet corruption. It's gonna make you, gonna break you. Ohh yeah, she said.... Haunt my house of pain. And feel my psycho love. We'll shine and pray for rain. To heal my psycho love. Legs at ten and two. Chain her down that's what you do. King Tut and snake-eyed slut. In the pink but screamin' blue. I'll taste your crazy, you smell insane. I'm just another ghost. Inside your spirits hall of fame. Haunt my house of pain. And feel my psycho love. We'll shine and pray for rain. To heal my psycho love. As the warm smooth soul. Chases through the cold silence. of a body. A body of touch not feel. One question is she a stone in the. devil's garden. Or a speck in an angels dust. Ashes to ashes. And lust to lust. She'll teach you true love. Watchin' you turn blue love. She'll wrap you in a chokehold. And suck your symptom dry"
18 and life,"Ricky was a young boy. He had a heart of stone. Lived nine to five. and worked his fingers to the bone. Just barely out of school, came from the edge of town. Fought like a switchblade. so no one could take him down. He had no money, ooh no good at home. He walked the streets a soldier. and he fought the world alone. And now it's. 18 and life You got it. 18 and life you know. Your crime is time and it's 18 and life to go. Tequila in his heartbeat. His veins burned gasoline.

beat yourself blind,"Give me a minute 'cause I'm wrapped in superstition. Pour me a chemical to take away the edge. Don't make up anything that's breaking all your fingers. Just slap around a bit of what it takes to pledge. Carry out another stone as a slave. Ask general-know-it-all ""Who's juggling the earth?"". Tease all the natives that will walk across your grave. And shove aside your nation all for what it's worth. (Chorus). Beat yourself blind (Repeat 6x). An open eyes and a closed mind. Look at the suit in suspended animation. A faded outline that used to be a man. A piece of paper that's fallen out a window. Has got a better chance to know where it will land. (Repeat Chorus). To bleed in vain, to bleed in vain--under my eyes are painted skies. Down at the boneyard, they're diggin' up the relics. Handfuls of parasites thrown into machines. I got the phone call they're tearin' down the mission. The zombies had a ball, but don't know what it means. Beat yourself blind."
beggar's day,"Suzi got an Uzi what a beautiful bride. That's where the trouble begun. Will there be any objection or a bloody resurrection. It's only up to Suzanne. A load of ammunition in her hand. She had 'em laughin' in the aisles. Venus Dee in the critical file. She wasn't there to pray. The killing joke had 'em laughin' all the way. All the way - all the way to Beggar's Day. She vowed to take 'em any way she can. All the way - all the way to Beggar's Day. Her jealous claim to fame has come. Now, all you beggars pay. Adam's in the chapel and he's swallowing his apple. Wearing out his ball and chain. But things were gettin' shady when the honorable maidy. Broke out the forty caliber rain. She had 'em laughin' in the aisles. Venus Dee in the critical file. She wasn't there to pray. The killing joke had 'em laughin' all the way. All the way - all the way to Beggar's Day. She vowed to take 'em any way she can. All the way - all the way to Beggar's Day. Her jealous claim to fame has come. Now, all you beggars pay"
big guns,"She was a ballerina on a subway train. Stiletto heels and a candy cane. Looked like a number on a station wall. Hot on the tail of a social call. I wet my lips I thought I had it made. Like Valentino with a hand grenade. I made my move with my libido on. She circled once and then she dropped the bomb. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Blew me away. And I went down in flames. I met a sidewalk preacher on a roller skate. He said he had the key to heaven's gate. I said: ""I'll wait for the movie 'cause I been there before"". And learned: like is a battle and love is war. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Took me by surprise. She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Blew me away. And I went down in flames. I'm doing time as a back seat Romeo. Play solitaire with my hands in the air. Another night and no bullets to spare. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Took me by surprise. She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky. She got the big guns. Pointed at my heart. Bang bang! Shooting like a firing squad. Big guns. Blew me away. And I went down in flames. Big guns (Big guns). Big guns, blew me away. And I went down in flames. Big guns, big guns. She really, really got the big guns. She shot me down in flames"

bonehead,"Is there a problem? The laugh of the rich man. Has got you crying poor. Are you as heavy as hell in a handbag. Or just a virgin whore?. If the weight of the world is on your shoulders. Then carry it for a day. Do you cry for peace or peace of mind;. Is reality in the way?. Enter the martyr out through the in door. The savior has arrived?. Is all your anger force of habit. And keeping you alive?. An empty shotgun shooting your mouth off. Something's on your mind. The cheap messiah of persecution. Is alive and doing fine. (Chorus). I won't leave if you stay, I don't buy what you say. If you're a new God let me see a miracle. I won't leave if you stay, I don't buy what you say. I can't say that you're a fool,. but if you're a new God let me see a miracle.."

catch your fall,"I know I love you, but rather hide behind it. Until I really find it in me. Before I tell you. I need to find the courage. And try to not discourage you. This is so much bigger. Than the both of us. So can we go the distance. Or will we fade away?. Like an old song. That we sing until it's all done. If the sky falls down around us. I want you here with me. Don't wanna lose you or make you feel unwanted. It's from the ghosts that haunted my heart. When you touch me I stand up like a statue. And I will always catch your fall. When we're alone together. We need no one else. Hide from the revolution. And watch it fade away. Like an old song. That we sing until it's all done. If the sky falls down around us. I want you here with me. I will be your shelter. I will be your hero. I will be your santcuary. I know I love you when the room is empty. And we can live through anything. Or fade away. Like an old song. That we sing until it's all done. Say goodbye to an old friend. And we'll drink until the worlds end. If the sky falls down around us. I want you here with me. I want you here with me. I need you here with me"
cats in the cradle,"My child arrived just the other day. Came to the world in the usual way. But there were planes to catch and bills to pay. He learned to walk while I was away.

See you later. Can I have them please ?'. Chorus. I've long since retired, my son's moved away.. I called him up just the other day.. 'I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.'.

Get up- 'cause she's ready to blow. Get up. Get up- get ready to go. Get up- you got to, got to. Get up- 'cause she's ready to blow. Get up. Done is the hatred that is scaling our walls. Won't turn a blind eye when you're storming our halls. If only once you had the presence of mind. You'd appreciate your fears if we left you behind. Does not our skin begin to burn away in eastern sun?. Bury your heads in the sand. Then celebrate with our blood in your hands. Get up- get ready to go. Get up- you know you got to. Get up- 'cause she's ready to blow. Get up. Get up- get ready to go. Get up- you got to. Get up- 'cause she's ready to blow. Get up. Sit back and feed on the wealth.

i remember you,"Woke up to soothing sound of pouring rain. The wind would whisper and I'd think of you. And all the tears you cried. That called my name. And when you needed me I came through.. I paint a picture of the days gone by. When love went blind and you would make me see. I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes. So that I knew that you were there for me. Time after time, you were there for me. Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand. Love letters in the sand, I remember you. Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day. I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you. We spent the summer with the top rolled down. Wished ever after would be like this. You said ""I love you babe,"" without a sound. I said I'd give up my life for just one kiss. I'd live for your smile, and die for your kiss. Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand. Love letters in the sand, I remember you. Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day. I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you. We've had our share of hard times. But that's the price we paid. And through it all, we kept the promise that we made. I swear you'll never be lonely. Woke up to soothing sound of pouring rain. Washed away a dream of you. But nothing else could ever take you away. 'cause you'll always be my dream come true. Oh my darling, I love you. Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand. Love letters in the sand, I remember you. Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day. I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you. Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand. Love letters in the sand, I remember you. Through all the sleepless nights, through every endless day. I'd wanna hear you say. I remember, I remember you. Ohhh uhhh yeah"

in a darkened room,"In a darkened room. Beyond the reach of God's faith. Lies the wounded, the shattered remains of love betrayed. And the innocence of a child is bought and sold. In the name of the damned. The rage of the angels left silent and cold. Forgive me please for I know not what I do. How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true. (Chorus). Tell me when the kiss of love becomes a lie. That bears the scar of sin too deep. To hide behind this fear of running unto you. Please let there be light. In a darkened room.... All the precious times have been put to rest again. And the smile of the dawn. Brings tainted lust singing my requiem. Can I face the day when I'm tortured in my trust. And watch it crystallize. While my salvation crumples to dust. Why can't I steer the ship before it hits the storm. I've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shore. (Chorus 2x). Tell me when the kiss of love becomes a lie. That bears the scar of sin too deep. To hide behind this fear of running unto you. Please let there be light.... In a darkened room!"
into another,"Slowly I heal the love that's found its way. Onto another path in times of change. Crossing a bridge unknown. Hoping our strength will hold. Should they both let go then let me lay. .....Let me lay. (Chorus). Show me a sign. To a light that shines. One direction into another. Sheltered peace of mind. Somewhere I lost a piece of memory. Somehow I know my legs will carry me. Searching for circles end. Hoping the wounds will mend. Should this scar, then it was meant to be. (Repeat Chorus 3x)."
ironwill,"Life comes and goes, quick as does the day. Greed, for those who know is just a step away. Time's a breathing bomb, going with the flow. Stand atop it all outside the status quo. No see, no speak then know where you're goin'. Drag your feet then nothing you're showin'. Take your place or fall to the lions. Lose your face and stand where you're dying. (Chorus). Living in a hole is taking its toll. My iron will's in position. Seize you are not owed, stand or fall. And refuse to be denied. Pride is all in vain without the blood of need. Bones can break in shame from taking charity. Hide from all the hell and wash up with the tide. Wait and you commit psychological suicide. Break the molds of beg and submission. Wake the dead or no one will listen. Holding ground is just the beginning. It's uphill bound and in for the killing. (Repeat Chorus)."

kings of demolition,We've got the bullet and the bible we defend it with. You can believe what you've been told. No such thing as zombies of an alien apocalypse. We've got the matters in control. Can't find salvation in a candy coated letter-bomb. No rights of passage are for free. We want till we need then we fight till we bleed. Then we walk till we crawl and we run till we fall. And cut our throats out socially. Even some angels are thrown in the fire. The demons inside me are ready for hire. Concealed in my mind is my darkest desire. All that is left is your burning empire. I'm king of the demolition. Justice is a new religion. Praise god for the ammunition. Get in back you can ride with the bullets. I'm king of the demolition. Justice is a new religion. Praise god for the ammunition. Get in back you can ride with the bullets. Get in back you can ride with the bullets. My retribution is without sincere apology. And every word is on a wire. We will stand till we die and we'll stare till we cry. And we'll live by he sword and the hands of the lord. Accounted for and justified. Even some angels are thrown in the fire. The demons inside me are ready for hire. Concealed in my mind is my darkest desire. All that is left is your burning empire. I'm king of the demolition. Justice is a new religion. Praise god for the ammunition. Get in back you can ride with the bullets. I'm king of the demolition. Justice is a new religion. Praise god for the ammunition.

lamb,"I have been here for so long. I've carried all the weight. 'til something pulls me underneath the tide. Climb to where the air is thin. so I can breathe again. Still it makes me wonder deep inside. Nothing's free. No one bleeds. We're all machines. Shadows of you sins are following you. When it sucks you in, it's swallowing you. King of the mountain, that's what I am. Everybody's someone else's sacrificial lamb. Space between the world and me. defying gravity. 'til something pulls me closer to the ground. Drink the chemicals we spill. Our eye is on the kill. While hell is freezing over, over."

my enemy,"Play the fence, one way you're gonna fall. Sometimes I don't know who you are at all. Your opinion is something that you've got inside. But I see the loyalty has up and died. Your skeletons. My skeletons. Life is only getting shorter. You can be my enemy and I don't care. Keep throwin' stones at yourself. Stories run in circles that have no end. I hit on luck, then you bum me out again. There's a way that you keep the truth in check. Scratch the surface and treat it like a broken neck. Keep the peace when face to face with the scene. Got a hunch that ain't what you really mean. Weather's fair, does that change where you stand?. My back is turned and the knife is in your hand. Your genocide. My genocide. Life is only getting shorter. You can be my enemy and I don't care. Keep throwin' stones at yourself. You can be my enemy and I don't care. You try too hard and I can tell."
new generation,"I sold my soul for you. You cut my life in two. Nightmares from what I've seen and where I've been. made me run from you again. Controlling, big brother's eye. Containment? I'd rather die. We're all part of a new generation. sold our souls to the next temptation. lead us not to our own damnation. I've seen what hatred brings. I've seen the flesh of kings. Blinded by my eyes my mouth you've sewn it shut. protecting me from fucking up?"
nothing,"Houses on the hill. Looking down on all the little people's lives. And wondering it I've been missing out. Growing up is hard, isn't that what Bowie sang. When he was young. Before he knew what growing up was like. Guess I’ll never know, so I'll take it day by day. As it comes until there's something else to think about. If I want it all then I'll get it all. Do I need it all? I need nothing. If I want it all then I'll get it all. Do I need it all? I need nothing but you. Changing with the times. Looking back on all our oldest memories to realize. We haven't changed at all. Records in my room. It’s still the place where we can go to get away. from real life and real agony. If we should disappear, we can take it day by day. As it comes until there’s something else to talk about. If I want it all then I'll get it all. Do I need it all? I need nothing. If I want it all then I'll get it all. Do I need it all? I need nothing but you. If I want it all then I'll get it all. Do I need it all? I need nothing. If I want it all then I'll get it all. Do I need it all? I need nothing.

one light,"There's a sound in my head. Holy wine,. breakin' bread between time and what. we said drifts the innocence we've. shed. In this moment there's a day for. a sad and broken babe. there's a. fracture on this hallowed ground. where we lay One light burns, one. light fades. Behind the door are. better days. When the light. shines on me I'll know the world. still turns. One light burns.. There's a prayer on the wall.. One by one say them all.. Why we run before we crawl stands. the reason that we fall. In the flower there's a field. Sublime. but so surreal. There's a fracture on. this sacred ground to be healed.."

pulling my heart out from under me,"I laid my soul in front of you. I tied myself to the railroad tracks. You refused my point of view. Then diluted all my facts. You won it, you broke it. You held it to choke it. You’re pulling my heart. Out from under. You won it, you broke it. You held it to choke it. You’re pulling my heart. Out from under me. I gave you all I had inside. And every chance to tell the truth. My faith in you has been denied. But forced a smile in spite of you. You won it, you broke it. You held it to choke it. You’re pulling my heart. Out from under.

quicksand jesus,"She caught the melting sky.. It burned but still the winter passes by and by to the other side. A slow parade of wind that blows through trees that wilted. With the season's children. Are we saved by the words of bastard saints? Do we live in fear or faith. Tell me now who's behind the rain. A maze of tangled grace. The symptoms of ""for real"" are crumbling from embrace. But still we chase...the shadows of belief. And new religion clouds our visions of the roots of our souls. Are we ashamed of our own fate. Or play the fool for our own sake. Tell me who's behind the rain. What do we need where do we go when we get where we don't know. Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow. When faith's our shelter from the cold. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away...away. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away. Quicksand Jesus I need you. Quicksand Jesus I believe you. Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away."

Boom, boom baby out go the lights. Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake. Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shake. Juicy Miss Lucy always diggin' on junk.

subhuman race,"Jesus knows my story, he knows the position that I'm in. A hooker knows the feeling to get fucked the way I've been. Turn my insides out; your mouth drank my water. (Chorus). You look at me like I'm subhuman. You talk to me like I'm subhuman. You're treating me like I'm subhuman. You're jumping into the subhuman race.

sweet little sister,She blew my mind behind the wrecking machine. She was a shitload of trouble called the Subway Queen. Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene. One night I caught her running out the cellar door. There was about a million people lying flat on the floor. For such a sweet little lady I would swear she's rotten to the core. She got her hands in the cookie jar. Smiling like an alligator. Makin' headlines in the back of her car. Tight-lipped now but sink ships later. I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister. Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister. She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister. Mona Lisa with a new tattoo. She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister. Every quittin' time is another disease. Too many cowboys ridin' high shootin' low at the knees. The back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze. The pettin's getting heavy got her tongue in her ear. her friend is doing time for kickin' ass on a queer. They're in a mental state and all their friends are here. She's tellin' lies through her burgundy lips. Angel on a mission of mercy. She'll get you dancin' with the crack of her whip. Take you up to heaven in her rocket ship. I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister. Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister. She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister. Mona Lisa with a new tattoo. She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister. She got her hands in the cookie jar smiling like an alligator. Makin' headlines in the back of her car. Tight-lipped now but sink ships later. I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister. Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister.

Like some disease you hoped would go away if left alone. You can sweep me under the carpet. But, I'll still infect your need to use me as a steppin' stone. So you think you cut me down to size.

Can you live with yourself. When you think of what. You've left behind. The sun will rise again. The earth will turn to sand. Creation's colors seem to fade to grey. And you'll see the sickly hands of time. Will write your final rhyme. And end a memory. I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy"
we are the damned,Down between the steely grates. Beneath the sewer's smile. This city is our camoflage. The under belly's bile. The night is choked with rosaries. Black air so thick with hate. This street belongs to us tonight. Lost souls attempting fate. This is not the war. That we're looking for. In our living hell. We raise our fists and yell. We are the strong. We are the weak. We are the burned. We are the freak. We are the wolf. We are the lamb. We are the lost. We are the damned. Freedom is the coup d'etat. As sure there is the sky. Tonight we roam the underworld. Our brothers by our side. Beggars underneath the bridge. The fifty-gallon fire. The rebels are on 34th. Big brother's getting tired. As we live and breath. Force fed what to believe. In our living hell. We raise our fists and yell. We are the strong. We are the weak. We are the burned. We are the freak. We are the wolf. We are the lamb. We are the lost. We are the damned. We are. We are the damned
what you're doing,"[Lee, Lifeson]. Well, I see you standin' there with your. finger in the air. Everything we do, you wanna leave it up. to you. Who do you think you are'. You think you are a star.

when god can't wait,"The kids are united, that's what we say. Sometimes you've got to shovel shit. To make a little pay. When we hear the whistle we break the gate. To lead 'em to freedom when God can't wait. God can't wait for sinners to come home. God can't wait for saints to stand alone. Fight the fight that fighters like to fight. Bleed to blood. That gets you through the night. We rebuilt the mission but broke the bell. The only way to heaven. Is straight through living hell. Someone phone a taxi to take us home. To our brothers and sisters and we’ll live on. God can’t wait for sinners to come home. God can’t wait for saints to stand alone. Fight the fight that fighters like to fight. Bleed to blood. That gets you through the night. They think by shooting bullets. It'll make us dance. Tell the fucking enemy. They stand no fucking chance. When we hear the whistle we break the gate. To lead ‘em to freedom when God can't wait. Lead 'em to freedom when God can't wait. Lead 'em to freedom when God can't wait. Lead 'em to freedom, we'll lead 'em to freedom. Lead 'em to freedom, we'll lead 'em to freedom. Lead 'em to freedom, we'll lead 'em to freedom"

you lie,"You lie to me a first time. You'll lie to me again. You pushed me out the front door. While some stranger's walking in. The way you say you love me. is as ugly as sin. You lie, you lie, you lie. I waited up 'til morning just wondering what you'd say. You stumbled on your story '. cause the truth got in the way. You choked on your confession,. but thought you had it saved. While someone else was jumpin' in my grave. You lie to me a first time. You'll lie to me again. You pushed me out the front door. While some stranger's walking in. The way you say you love me is. as ugly as sin. You lie, you lie, you lie. I'm counting on the future, forgetting 'bout the past. Just knowing you're not honest,. well I knew it wouldn't last. I'm trying to believe you. but it's such a fucking chore. You lyin', cheatin' dirty little whore. You lie to me a first time.

youth gone wild,"Rollin'. Woah yeah... Since I was born,. They couldn't hold me down. Another misfit kid,. Another burned-out town. I never played by the rules and I never really cared,. My nasty reputation takes me everywhere. Well I look n' see it's not only me. So many others have stood where I stand,. We are the young - so raise your hands. (Chorus). They call us problem child,. We spend our lives on trial,. We walk an endless mile - we are the Youth Gone Wild. We stand and we won't fall - we're one and one for all. The writing's on the wall - we are the Youth Gone Wild. My boss screamin' my ear 'bout who I'm s'posed to be,. ""Get a three-piece Wall Street smile, and son you'll look. just like me"". I said ""Hey, man, there's somethin' you oughta know, well I tell ya Park Avenue leads to...Skid Row!!"". Well I look n' see it's not only me. We're standing tall, ain't never a doubt. We are the young, so shout it out. (repeat chorus). Well lemme hear ya get wild!. (guitar solo). (repeat chrorus). (typical Bach-style screaming to fade). We are the Youth Gone Wild!"
zero day,"Their eyes are looking down on us. The walls, they all have ears. Theres nothing sacred left except our hatred, love and tears. I know the person trapped behind that seven mile stare. If only I could save you without kicking out the chair. Light me aflame before I freeze. Until I climb from my disease. Take the power back. Fight with all your will. Bleed for the cause. Eat what you kill. Us against the world. Live for what you say. We have gained control. We'll meet again on Zero Day. Has anybody out there been absolve of all their sins?. I'm juggling the hand grenades and pulling all the pins. We've made a crooked circle back to the subway train. The poachers and the preachers are all circling the drain. I'd rather burn before I freeze. Or throw the fight than to appease. Take the power back. Fight with all your will. Bleed for the cause. Eat what you kill. Us against the world. Live for what you say. We have gained control. We'll meet again on Zero Day. We'll meet again on Zero Day. Meet again on Zero Day. Take the power back. Fight with all your will. Bleed for the cause. Eat what you kill. Us against the world. Live for what you say. We have gained control. We'll meet again on Zero Day"
