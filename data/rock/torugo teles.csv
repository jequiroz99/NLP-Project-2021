without you,Now that I've lost you. I'm suffering without you. Without your affection. Without your love. I can be alone no more. I need you by my side. Why don't you warm up my heart?. And now? without you. I can't breath anymore. I'm dying of love. So please come back to me. This's the way I'm gonna be happy. Be able to fill myself. When you come back to me. Everything will fit again. The time left behind. Won't be back anymore. Only it can speak for both of us. . This's the way I'm gonna be happy. Be able to fill myself. When you come back to me. Everything will fit again
