This story is over, I bid you farewell. I bid you farewell, now drag me to hell"

dead to the world,"I have died a hundred times before. Your words have ripped out my insides. I find revenge within my soul. I've tried a thousand times before. To leave my demons behind me for good. I'm trapped with no escape to find. Lost without hope. Hope is now lost. As I hang on for one more tomorrow. Heart turn to black. I'm not coming back. I know I can't last. ‘cause I feel like I'm dead to the world. Feel like I'm dead to the world. I've craved the feel of your caress. No chance to hold you or hurt you again. I've gone way too far this time (time). Too far this time. I craved the sound of your distress. I loved to take out my failures on you. I'm not the old forgiving kind. Lost without hope. Hope is now lost. As I hang on for one more tomorrow. Heart turn to black. I'm not coming back. I know I can't last. ‘cause I feel like I'm dead to the world. I feel like I'm dead to the world.

Bound by my sins so my wings have been clipped. I'm paying the price, I'm doing the time. Serving my sentence for doing this crime. So show me the heavens or drag me to hell. This story is over, I bid you farewell. I bid you farewell, now drag me to hell"

domination,Agony is the price. That you'll pay in the end. Domination consumes you. Then calls you a friend. It's a twisted fall. Binds are like steel. And manipulates the will to be. And it's hard to see. How soon we forget. When there's nothing else. Left to destroy. It's a useless ploy. Your eyes will see. The dawn of the day. And the writing. On the wall. Those words that stare. Into your soul. And to yourself. You will befall. It's domination pushed into living hell. Domination. A now blacked heart. Is reaching out in divinity. Body suspended by chains over razors. And nails it's a penalty. Each razor a vice and each nail. Marks the demise of you life.. Grim construction grows. Has life played a trick. Sealed you in brick by brick. Till your end forcing you to bend. Your eyes will see. The dawn of the day. And the writing. On the wall. Those words that stare. Into your soul. And to yourself. It's domination pushed into living hell. Domination.

Reaching out as the angels stare. Crying out in loving memory. Holding on for a final prayer. Crying out in loving memory. Reaching out as the angels stare. Crying out in loving memory.

Fear has no place (no place). Cover her face. Holding on to you.... ...to keep from falling. Your eyes are closing now. Another chapter's ending. This is our last goodbye (goodbye!).

the very last time,Your eyes don't lie. A pair of daggers cutting through my mind. Your stare it rips a hole into my life. Am I supposed to leave this all behind?. It's on my skin. Your scent is poison when I breathe you in. It's there with every single breath I take. If this is it then don't resuscitate. I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time. I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine. It's on my skin. Your scent is poison when I breathe you in. I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time (for the very last time). Don't you speak. You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak. I guarantee I won't be losing sleep. 'Cause you're the one that made this end complete. I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time. I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine. Don't you speak. You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak. I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time (for the very last time). Breathing. I'm still breathing. I'm still breathing. I'm still breathing. I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time. I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine. Don't you speak.

truth hurts,"One more drink, one more pill. Just one more lie to make me feel. Like I have something left to give. Cause without it I'm just giving in. It's just a circle that's going. It spirals down and it sends you to hell. There's nothing here that can save me now. I'm coming up just to come back down. (Come back down). Truth hurts and I'm in pain. Truth hurts like a bed of nails. Letting denial eat me up inside. The truth hurts, and it bleeds me dry. No more lies, no more games. Is it too late to make a change?. If hope is gone then what's the point. Just pass my knife and it cuts my throat. A downward spiral takes control. Another chance to sell my soul. There's no one here that can save me now. I'm coming up just to come back down. (Come back down). Truth hurts and I'm in pain. Truth hurts like a bed of nails. Letting denial eat me up inside. The truth hurts, and it bleeds me dry. Truth hurts and I'm in pain. Truth hurts like a bed of nails. Letting denial eat me up inside. The truth hurts, and it bleeds me dry. (Come back down). Truth hurts and I'm in pain.

The truth hurts, and it bleeds me dry"
turn to despair,"Needs to be a revolution. Maybe theirs to be less tension. They become into the nature. Far frustrating. Need some time for recollection. Maybe I don't need this fixing. Need to be a thing to nature. So proceed with caution. I pull my heart from the end. You always took it and broke it over me. You say that I didn't care. How could my dream turn to despair?. Turn to despair. There is temporary redemption. Your demise is my creation. Let me talk into the next one. Talking symbols. We need some hope and recollection. Maybe then there'll be less tension. Take the one and burn the clothes off. Proceed with caution. I pull my heart from the end. You always took it and broke it over me. You say that I didn't care. How could my dream turn to despair?. Push it, go. Time to release the crease in the beast. The blood shed and killing when will it cease. Clenching our fist at the snap of our wrist. Time to get up and get down with the shh. Too much sorrow, no tomorrow. Too much sorrow, no tomorrow. Too much sorrow, no tomorrow. Too much sorrow, no tomorrow. Turn to despair. Turn to despair"
under again,"Lost in the dark. In a wilderness of nothing. Where do I start. When my world is self destructing. So confused, so confused. Nowhere to run. Need to numb this pain with something. Coming undone. Need to pull myself together. So confused, so confused. I'm coming undone. It's the beginning of the end. 'Cause when I'm losing my head. It feels like I'm going under, under again and again. 'Cause when I'm losing my head. It feels like I'm going under, under again. Where's the sun?. I'm still crawling in the darkness. Needing someone. To come put me back together. So confused, so confused. I'm coming undone. It's the beginning of the end. 'Cause when I'm losing my head. It feels like I'm going under, under again and again. 'Cause when I'm losing my head. It feels like I'm going under, under again. (It feels like I'm going under, under again). So confused, so confused. So confused, so confused. 'Cause when I'm losing my head. It feels like I'm going under, under again and again. 'Cause when I'm losing my head.

welcome home (sanitarium) metallica cover,"Welcome to where time stands still. No one leaves and no one will. Moon is full, never seems to change. Just labeled mentally deranged. Dream the same thing every night. I see our freedom in my sight. No locked doors, no windows barred. No things to make my brain seem scarred. Sleep my friend and you will see. That dream is my reality. They keep me locked up in this cage. Can't they see it's why my brain says rage. Sanitarium, leave me be. Sanitarium, just leave me alone. Build my fear of what's out there. And cannot breathe the open air. Whisper things into my brain. Assuring me that I'm insane. They think our heads are in their hands. But violent use brings violent plans. Keep him tied, it makes him well. He's getting better, can't you tell?. No more can they keep us in. Listen, damn it, we will win. They see it right, they see it well. But they think this saves us from our hell. Sanitarium, leave me be. Sanitarium, just leave me alone. Sanitarium, just leave me alone. Fear of living on. Natives getting restless now. Mutiny in the air. Got some death to do. Mirror stares back hard. Kill, it's such a friendly word. Seems the only way. For reaching out again"
