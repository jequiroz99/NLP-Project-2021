loser's squad,Once in a while fear comes to life. And haunt us one by one. The scariest thing of our mind. Takes form and wants to bite. Only a strong bond can defeat the lights of death. As we're together innocence is a weapon. We are the leftovers. Would you dare to threaten?. Chorus: remember the time that once we forgot. When we were strong and the death we fought. We are the losers and nothing can stop. The will of survivors the losers's squad. We used to play in a riverbed. That's where we started this brotherhood. Nothing was special about us. But we have conquered what no one could. Everyone has a sort of sadness. And need something to stand for. I'll carry you my dear brother. To get you out of this rotten floor. I bet you think it's an horror story. 'cause certainly we were terrified. We peed our pants once maybe twice. But this is a tale of losers' squad
