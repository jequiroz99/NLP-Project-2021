talk on the street,Oh mama you lie in ruin. Can't you see what you've done. Well I've been there before. What's this war that you won. Oh mama you walk this way. And I'm crying inside. Well I've been there before. And you know that it's time. And everybody's talking. But you never let them know. Yes I can hear them talking. Everyone knows. That's there's talking on the streets. Remember the days. When there's no one to defeat. Follow me down. To the mountain of the sun. Forgetting the end. As your new life has begun. Look mama the light is low. And the darkness near. Yes everyone is looking for me and you. And the night's what you fear. Walk someone they follow us. And you're all undone. Yes everyone is looking for me and you. And the war has begun. And everybody's talking. But you never let 'em know. Yes I can hear them talking. Everyone knows. That's there's talking on the streets. Remember the days. When there's no one to defeat. Follow me down. To the mountain of the sun. Forgetting the end. As your new life has begun. And everybody's talking. And you never let them know. Yes I can hear them talking. And you never let them know
the cold wind,"Oh sweet mama, lay me down in my grave. Leave me baby, I'm too far gone to save. The snow is comin', all the village folk know. This wicked shiver, chills me down to my soul. Only time will tell. Take the ox to town and you can sell. And leave me in my bed. Today. The Yankee peddler bargains with you on his way. Woe sweet mama's gotten herself a new dray. Keep the children snug as the wagon rolls on. When the cold wind blows most of them will be gone. Only time can tell. Take the ox to town and I'll get well. And leave me in my bed. Today. Only time will tell. You take the ox to town and you can sell. And leave me in my bed. Today"
the new day,"Let the new day shine its light on me. Shake the old way, nights too dark to see. Free tomorrow, it's bright with something new. Believe the righteous, and it will come true. You're a child in the garden. You're growing up I'll watch you bloom. And your dreams are not forgotten. You'll be a woman soon. Love isn't greed it's a need that goes unspoken. Love doesn't leave when you fade away. Pain isn't vain if it means your heart's been broken. Pain is the same as a means to heal. Let me try love, you know I'm only one. Live or die love, I tried and to me won. We're the future, it's hard to say we know. And the suture is what we have to sew. You are a child in the garden. You're growing up I'll watch you bloom. And your dreams are not forgotten. You'll be a woman soon. Love isn't greed it's a need that goes unspoken. Love doesn't leave when you fade away. Pain isn't vain if it means your heart's been broken. Pain is the same as means to heal. Love doesn't fade away (x2)"
watching over,Many long years amongst the trees. Many long years underground. To be the one that's never seen. The one that stands and watches over. I wonder when we'll realize. This is what we got left. And it's on demise. With the border rising. And the answers there. Still the children smiling. And we see no share. This is what we all have seen. Too many years getting down. Even thought we couldn't believe. It's only clearer in a mirror. I wonder when we all realize. This is what we got left. And it's on demise. With the border rising. And the answers there. Still the children smiling. And we see no share. Never seen. Never seen
when the curtain falls,"Well, you feel pretty and I love you so. You know I'm your biggest fan. I saw your picture and it's the best. The finest in the land. Camera lights and action. And words you know so well. You're in and out of fashion. In Hollywood of hell. When the curtain falls. Walk the hollow halls babe. Once a valley doll. Now you're not at all. No. Well I love you in that movie show. Can I have your autograph. It's so funny you have such charm. And whole thing made me laugh. Obetral and cocktails. You're counting all your rings. They all said they loved you. (Didn't they darlin'). Well they've taken all your things. When the curtain falls. Walk the hollow halls babe. Once a valley doll. Now you're not at all. No. Well listen darlin. It's been real swell. What can I say. You've got it all. You're a one woman show. But I'm not gonna' lie. You could use a little work. Well at your age. What've you got baby. When the curtain falls. Walk the hollow halls babe. Once a valley doll. Now you're not at all. Goodbye baby, goodbye"
you're the one,"Babe, ain't no denyin. That I've got you in my head. Girl, I'd be flyin. If you stood yourself and said. You're the one I want. You're the one I need. You're the one I have. So come on back to me. Girl, you're so young and pretty. But you're evil, you wouldn't know. Darling, ain't that a pity. Well I almost lost my mind. You're the one I want. You're the one I need. You're the one I have. So come on back to me. See, where we've been. That you'll hold my hand and stay awhile. You're the one I want. You're the one I need. You're the one I have. So come on back to me. Come on baby"
