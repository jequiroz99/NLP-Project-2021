When you wake up in the mornin'. And you can't remember much about the night before.. A small reminder of the state you were in. Are all the tattered clothes across the floor.. And your head still keeps singin'. The phone still keeps ringin'. Remember just exactly where you've been.. 'Cos there ain't no doubt about it. There's no better things to see. Then what you've seen.

Not a soul realises your a Dapple Rose of fame"

pity the mother,She's left to rear a child because of war. Sadly alone. Works hard to clothe and feed her little son. Give him a home. She works all night into the early morn. Streets cold and damp. Stands at the corner near the Pig and Gun. Lit by a lamp. Break. She has to work hard to scrimp and save. Or he will go. Go to a home somewhere far away. She loves him so. Tired but she knows that it's the only way. She wanders home. Home to the child that's sleeping sound and warm. Never a moan

when the lights are out,With the lights out. We'll be sitting pretty. Scream a pitiful scream. With the lights out. We'll be warm and willing. Better watch where I lean. When you gaze into a crystal ball. You'll see nothings gonna change at all. You'll see nothing gonna happen over night. So please. Chorus. When the lights are out. When I hear you sigh. Let me feel you warm breath on my neck. It makes me hit the sky. (repeat). With a whisper. You can bowl me over. Blow a beautiful blow. With an answer. You can turn me under. Wind up ready to go. When you gaze into a crystal ball. You'll see nothings gonna change at all. You'll see nothings gonna happen over night. So please. Chorus. when the lights are out. When I hear you sigh. Let me feel you warm breath on my neck. It makes me hit the sky. (repeat). When you gaze into a crystal ball. You'll see nothings gonna change at all. You'll see nothings gonna hapen over night. So please. Chorus. (repeat)

When she always cries,. Just read between the line,. Chorus. I tried to lover you now I'm here. Takin' things as I find them,. Now I'm here, wastin' time,. Thinkin of me,. Lookin' back on my life,. Wonderin' why.. It's hard to see and to understand,. Just-a what its like,. To be pushed around,. Kickin' stone along the ground.. I dont' think it will ever change,. Can I find a way. To the front again,. And have another chance to spend,. My life with you and now I'm here. Chorus"

Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart. And you'll never walk alone,. You'll never, ever walk alone."
