so far away,"Never feared for anything. Never shamed but never free. A life to heal the broken heart with all that it could. Lived the life so endlessly. Saw beyond what others see.

the stage,"So I arrived, naked and cold. A welcomed change from the abeyance. Of a ghost town catacomb. No need for counsel I appreciate the time. I'm not alone. (why don't you get my lawyer on the phone). There were days, these child eyes. Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize. I found my heart for the first time. And I awakened in me. I left myself to navigate and oh I felt control. (It seems these sheep have quite an appetite). Who is the crowd. That peers through the cage. As we perform here, upon the stage. As the boy, became a man. In came a calm sophistication. I can hardly understand. So lost in ego. Didn't notice when the time had slipped away. (yeah, everybody's got a sob story). Jesus christ, was born to die. Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize. We're simply sociopaths with no communication baby. I see your angle but we differ. From our points of view. (so tell me, what's your cross to bear). Who is the crowd that peers through the cage. As we perform here upon the stage. Tell me a lie in a beautiful way. I believe in answers just not today. Hope my wheels don't abandon me now. Seein' that I'm out here alone. I'm runnin' out of fight. And the wind speaks a comforting voice. Guiding me to her arms. Mother, I'm alright. It took the birth of sin. To snake-rattle the mind. Before a blow to the head. By the gavel of time to wake up. Won't you wake up?. When did the walking apes. Decide that nuclear war. Was the only solution. For them keeping the score. Just wake up. Can't you wake up?. (Do you know this is just a simulation don't you?). Who is the crowd that peers through the cage. As we perform here upon the stage. Tell me a lie in a beautiful way. I believe in answers just not today"

Ooooo?.. Stand up and fight.. The fighting rages on and on, to challenge me you must be strong.. I walk your land but don't belong, two million soldiers can't be wrong.. It's no fun but I've been here before. I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war.. (Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things). Some are scared others killing for fun, I shot a mother right in front of her son.. (Take this from my consciousness, and please erase my dreams). Fight for honor, fight for your life.. Pray to God that our side is right.. Even though we won, I still may lose. Until I make it home to you. I see our mothers filled with tears,. grew up so fast where did those years go?. Memories wont let you cry. unless I don't return tonight.. So many soldiers on the other side, I take their lives so they can't take mine.. (Scared to make it out alive now murder's all I know.). Nobody tells me all the reasons we're here.. I have my weapons so there's nothing to fear.. (Another day, another life, but nothing real to show for). Fight for honor, fight for your life.. Pray to God that our side is right.. Even though we won, I still may lose. Until I make it home to you. I see our mothers filled with tears,. grew up so fast where did those years go?. Memories wont let you cry. unless I don't return tonight.. Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise.. Living another day in disguise.. These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight.. Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive.. Stranger's blood on my hands, I've shot all I can. There are no silent nights, watching your brothers all die. To destroy all their plans with no thought of me. No thought of me, no thought of me. Ohhhhhhhhhh..... I walked the city lonely. Memories that haunt are passing by. A murderer walks your street tonight. Forgive me for my crimes, don't forget that I was so young. Fought so scared in the name of God and country"
god damn,"Oh!. Hey! can't you see. We're tripping on the wire. Walking through the candy land. Of our desires. Press the magic button. And behold the world you crave. Where's the fun in freedom. When it renders you a slave?. Pledge allegiance, no flag. God nation, goddamned. The devil dances with the scorned. And how the fire keeps us warm. Hey! it goes beyond big brother in the sky. Beyond the threat of martial law. No horus eye. No one came to cuff you. They just handed you the chains. Blind follows the blind. And now the one-eyed man is king. Pledge allegiance, no flag. God nation, goddamned. The devil dances with the scorned. And how the fire keeps us warm. Tunnel vision, no man. Damnation, god damn. Can't see the forest for the trees. Can't heal the wound before we bleed. No form of payment. No pot of gold will satisfy. The debt of what he's owed. Spilling from the houses in a trance. The children lined up on the road. Cursing at the piper. As he lured your kids away. And led them to the river. For what was their final day. No need for convincing. On his pipe he played a song to fool them all. Fooled them all. Pledge allegiance, no flag. God nation, goddamned. The devil dances with the scorn. And now the fire keeps us (keeps us). Tunnel vision, no man. Damnation, god damn. Can't see the forest for the trees. Can't heal the wound before we bleed"
roman sky,"As the embers rose through the roman sky. Tell me were you calm, when they took your life?. Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow. Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door. Shine forever true. Shared with us the world well, before your time. Though they took your voice, words forever shine. Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow. Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door. Shine forever true. As they spoke your fate, a fearless man replied. ""As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"". Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow. Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door. Shine forever true"

simulation,"It seems I should have walked away. Reverse the wager I've no means to pay. Toto has pulled back the green tonight. In sight. And blue pills coat with such disdain. I wore the shades for so long. That I've forgotten how to see. The curtain rises. But who dares to pull the strings. I know this may be hard. For you to believe in all. But you only exist because we allow it. I question all the voices in my head. Are they mine or have I been misled?. Total understanding doesn't seem. To mean a thing. When you can't see behind the silver screen. A figurine. Can't you hear me scream?. By the way of cosmic rays. A subtle breakdown jarred the code display. A simulation as I can tell, our cell. Playing out a hopeless scene. We stand to lose all our charm. And faith just seems to wane. A billion years can seem. A stunningly short time. You've been beaten down time and time again. But still you find yourself. At the center of it all. I question all the voices in my head. Are they mine or have I been misled?. Total understanding doesn't seem. To mean a thing. When you can't see behind the silver screen. A figurine. Can't you hear me scream?. You hear me. You had one thing to do, one thing. And you fucked it up, piece of shit. Nurse, patient 666158 needs to be sedated. We need 500 ccs of Blue Comfort. Oh hello there, dearie. I've been expecting you. Posturing the way I feel. Is truth only what we believe is real?. Marvel the sketches that paint the night. Starlight. And take a breath before it's all erased away"
critical acclaim,"(Shh quiet, you might piss somebody off). Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long. While you feed off others' insecurities. You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds. Self-righteousness is wearing thin. (Lies inside your head, your best friend). Heart bleeds but not for fellow man. (Broken glass, your fake reflection). I've had enough. it's time for something real. I don't respect the words you're speaking. Gone too far, a clone. So, how does it feel to know that someone's kid. in the heart of America has blood on their hands,. Fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain a lifestyle. That insults his family's existence?. Well, where I'm from we have a special salute. That we aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes. Who spend their days pointing fingers. (Fuck you). (Shh quiet, you might piss somebody off). Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long. I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your. Generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies. Tabloid gossip queen, worthless men. (There's no need for us to bury you). Selfish agenda once again. (Right this way, you dug your own grave). I've had enough. It's time for something real. I don't respect the words you're speaking. Gone too far, a clone. All the way from the east to the west. We've got this high society looking down on their very foundation. Constantly reminding us that our actions. Are the cause of all their problems. Pointing their fingers in every direction. Blaming their own nation for who wins elections. They've never contributed a fucking thing. To the country they love to criticize. Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue. Depictions we see try and get through. Admitting mistakes can hurt. I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first. (Shh Quiet, you might piss somebody off). Self-righteousness is wearing thin. (Lies inside your head, your best friend). Heart bleeds but not for fellow man. (Broken glass, your fake reflection). I've had enough. it's time for something real. I don't respect the words you're speaking. Gone too far, a clone"
higher,Freed of the world. Shed of the weight. Onward to see you my friend. Light years above. (take me higher). Time seems to wait. (take me higher). Promise to see you again. It haunts to remember. All the memories of that day. Pre-flight demonstration. Led to desperate voices fueled by flames. Now I'm out here waitin'. Hoping you would send a sign. Came a million miles. And the earth grows small. As I lovingly leave it behind. Freed of the world. Shed of the weight. Onward to see you my friend. We seem to have found it. All the hope we've been denied. There's more than we've been told. Had to find it on the other side. Now I must be dreaming. Face against the frozen glass. But there's no return now. And the blazing worlds salute. As we go flying past. Freed of the world. Shed of the weight. Onward to see you my friend. Light years above. (take me higher). Time seems to wait. (take me higher). Promise to see you again. Meet you in the stars tonight. There you find me drifting. In the ether within the hill
waking the fallen,Wake the ones and rise tonight. Fallen souls we shine so bright. Rise now and ever. Forgotten memories. No one can touch us

a little piece of heaven,"Before the story begins,. is it such a sin. for me to take what's mine. until the end of time. We were more than friends. before the story ends. And I will take what's mine,. create what God would never design. Our love had been so strong for far too long,. I was weak with fear that something would go wrong,. before the possibilities came true,. I took all possibility from you. Almost laughed myself to tears,. conjuring her deepest fears.

Eat it eat it eat it. Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways. I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave. I gotta make up for what I've done.

acid rain,"Our day has come. It's drawn in the sky. So don't shed a tear now. Be thankful for the time. Life wouldn't be so precious, dear. If there never was an end.

There's no death, no end of time. When I'm facing it with you. Children still play in the garden. Dance as the sun slips away. Not even stars last forever. Cleanse us acid rain. Stand near to me. Don't look, be brave. Over the blackened moon. I'll carry you away. Through the planets we fly. Children still play in the garden. Dance as the sun slips away. Not even stars last forever. Cleanse us acid rain. Send us home. Send us home. Send us home. Send us home"
afterlife,"Like walking into a dream,. So unlike what you've seen. So unsure but it seems,. 'cause we've been waiting for you. Fallen into this place,. just giving you a small taste.

No pain or sign of time. (I'm much too young to fall). So out of place don't wanna stay,. I feel wrong and that's my sign. I've made up my mind. Gave me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye. Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life. I don't belong here,. we gotta move on dear. Escape from this afterlife.

almost easy,"I feel insane every single time. I'm asked to compromise. Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways. And that's the way it stay-ay-ays. So how long did I expect love to out weigh ignorance. Now that look on your face. I may have forced the scale to tip. I'm not insane, I'm not insane. I'm not insane, I'm not - not insane. (Mother). Come back to me, it's almost easy. (Said it all). Come back again, it's almost easy. Shame pulses through my heart. From the things I've done to you. It's hard to face, but the fact remains. That this is nothing new-oh-oh-oh. I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories. Selfish beneath the skin. But deep inside I'm not insane.. I'm not insane, I'm not insane.. I'm not insane, I'm not - not insane.. (Mother). Come back to me, it's almost easy. (Said it all). Come back again, it's almost easy. (You learned your lesson). Come back to me, it's almost easy. (But first you fall). Come back again, it's almost easy. Now that I've lost you it kills me to say. (Hurts to say). I tried to hold on as you slowly slipped away.. I'm losing the fight.. I treated you so wrong, now let me make it right.. (Make it all right). I'm not insane, I'm not insane. Ha Ha Ha Ha. I'm not insane, I'm not - not insane.. (Mother).

an epic of time wasted,"So much time I've wasted.. I can truly say I never thought it would come to this.. Never would I doubt you, but the truth kept smacking me in the face.. Reality. You never stopped to think and you ripped us apart.. How could you? Now our time is gone but it's still breaking my heart.. Tears run down as I think of the days we've had,. And the memories will last forever,. But you and I have died and gone our separate ways.. You are the one.. You are the wrong one.. Breaking the mold.. Going your own way.. All I feel, betrayal.. So much time I've wasted, and I never thought it'd come to this.(3x). Apology.. We had something great, then it was washed away.. We had something more, then I can explain.. I'm sorry. No! We had something great, then it was washed away.. No! Not all friendships last, the genuine are harder to take.. No! Time to start again, hope someday you'll think of me.. No! The end reality, I know someday I'll think of you."
and all things will end,"Lived through you,. safe with how we lived our lives,. with how it all turned out.. (But things are bound to change). Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout,. will make you change your mind. Sometimes life is altered. Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right. When I see you, I can read it in your eyes,. fate misunderstood.. (But things are bound to change). Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for,. thinking with your heart.. Sometimes life is altered.. Break from the ropes your hands are tied.. Uneasy with confrontation.. Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right. I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes. I know, I know.. Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be alright. I know, I know. (I never imagined my life could turn out this way. So cold so black so alone). Living goes by fast, catch your breath. and it will pass you by.. And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold.. Sometimes life is altered.. Break from the ropes your hands are tied.. Uneasy with confrontation.. Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right. Sometimes life is altered.. Break from the ropes your hands are tied.. Uneasy with confrontation.. Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right"
angels,"Took me years to make my motives clear. And the days have not been kind. Once a steady gaze and charming smile. Has been buried in the lines I find. I walk in the noise, quiet employs. And darkness seems to know just where I am. Mother wash the devil from my hands. Pray the lord I have the strength to stand. Mother, tell me was it all a lie?. Show me where the angels die. There are words that never found my lips. There are words I'd soon forget. Thought the trick was never to look back. But it seems I've lost my grip, I slip. The faster we run now, the closer the gun now. And somehow all the bullets bear my name. Mother wash the devil from my hands. Pray the lord I have the strength to stand. Mother, tell me was it all a lie?. Show me where the angels die. Took the road but should have chased the stars. Now I've lost my own way home. Had a photo of the time we shared. But I burned it long ago, I know. I struck all the matches stuck in the ashes. Forgive me, won't you simply speak my name. Mother wash the devil from my hands. Pray the lord I have the strength to stand. Mother, tell me was it all a lie?. Show me where the angels die. The faster we run now, the closer the gun now. And somehow we all found. The warmth of the gun now (x6). Took the road but should have chased the stars. Now I've lost my own way home. Had a photo of the time we shared. But I burned it long ago (x2)"
as tears go by,It is the evening of the day. I sit and watch the children play. Smiling faces I can see. But not for me. I sit and watch. As tears go by. My riches can't buy everything. I want to hear the children sing. All I hear is the sound. Of rain falling on the ground. I sit and watch as tears go by. It is the evening of the day. I sit and watch the children play. Doing things I used to do. They think are new. I sit and watch as tears go by

betrayed,"Passion in my eyes, I lived it everyday, but how could you go throw it all away?. In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true. As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do. I feel it burn inside, burning me like the rising sun. Lifted into the sky, took away the only thing I loved. I know after tonight all your power crumbles in my arms. So don't worry, I'll be fine, when my life ends, I'll leave this scar. When I fell down, I needed you there. Every note and every word seems so hard to take. Finally, In destiny. A smoking gun in your hand, now don't you realize what you've done. Put a bullet in his back, your hero since you were so young. How could you kill the man who brought salvation through your pain. He must mean everything to end it all this shameful way. Passion in my eyes, I lived it everyday, but how could you go throw it all away?. In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true. As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do. I started here so young and helped you get along. Just did it for the love, and people healed through us. Don't live you life in vain, don't take it out on me. You're cracked, so just remember, I'm not your enemy. I don't deserve to fall this way, by a man who felt betrayed. I felt so down now you're around to rescue me. Every note and every word i'm listening. Sometimes problems seem too deep to take. Sometimes I cry thinking my future looks so bleak. Finally, together we were destined, I know what's best for us in the end. Someone hear me, someone stop me, someone listen, why aren't you listening?. Passion in my eyes, I lived it everyday, but how could you go throw it all away?. In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true. As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do. In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true. As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left to finish you"

As I sit up here and wonder ""bout how you sold your mind, body and soul. Looking at the fields so green I know this sounds obscene. I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty. As they thank the Lord the blind can't see. Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease. I'd run away tonight. With my mind still intact I'm gonna make it alright. Easier said than done. With no place to hide and having no place to run. You've fallen asleep in denial. Look at the way we're dyin'.

buried alive,Take the time just to listen. When the voices screaming are much too loud. Take a look in the distance. Try and see it all. Chances are that you might find. That we share a common discomfort now. I feel I'm walking a fine line. Tell me only if it's real. Still I'm on my way (on and on it goes). Vacant hope to take. Hey!. I can't live in here for another day. Darkness. Has kept the light concealed. Grim as ever. Hold on. To faith as I dig another grave. Meanwhile. The mice endure the wheel. Real as ever. And it seems I've been buried alive. I walked the fields through the fire. Taking steps until I found solid ground. Followed dreams reaching higher. Couldn't survive the fall. Much has changed since the last time. And I feel a little less certain now. You know I jumped at the first sign. Tell me only if it's real. Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes). Wash my view away. Hey!. I can't live in here for another day. Darkness. Has kept the light concealed. Grim as ever. Hold on. To faith as I dig another grave. Meanwhile. The mice endure the wheel. Real as ever. And I'm chained like a slave. Trapped in the dark. Slammed all the locks. Death calls my name. And it seems I've been buried alive. Take you down now. Burn it all out. Throw you all around. Get your fucking. Hands off me!. What's it feel like?. Took the wrong route. Watch it fall apart. Now you're knocking. At the wrong gate!. For you to pay the toll. A price for you alone. The only deal you'll find. I'll gladly take your soul. While it seems sick. Sober up quick. Psycho lunatic. Crushing you with. Hands of fate!. Shame to find out. When it's too late. But you're all the same. Trapped inside. Inferno awaits!. Evil thoughts can hide. I'll help release the mind. I'll peel away the skin. Release the dark within.

clairvoyant disease,"Dust begins to fall to the ground. The air is cold and thin. Thoughts are haunting me as I look around. This will never end. And I'll bleed forever.

coming home,I've been away. Searching for a reason. Another purpose to find. I've sailed the seas. Fought my many demons. I've looked to gods in the skies. I've stood in hell. Where many had to suffer. I stared the devil in the eyes. Walked many roads. To witness ancient idols. And found the great Gates of fire. Had many storms. Question my conviction. Gave armies reason to rise. The hangman's searching. For bones he can borrow. while I scaped in the night. Fight or flight!. Live again. All roads end. I'll be coming home. Tend your light. Cause on this night. I'll be coming home. I escaped the hail. Of calculated mortars. then drunk the blood of a king. A desert rain. has washed away direction. Had angels looking after me. So it seems. Live again. All roads end. I'll be coming home. Tend your light. Cause on this night. I'll be coming home. (Solo). My story ends. Not far from where it started. My weary limbs have grown old. I've seen the world. Through the eyes of a nomad. Home is where the heart is. I've been told. So I go. Live again. All roads end. I'll be coming home. Tend your light. Cause on this night. I'll be coming home. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. I'm coming home
creating god,"Standing in the shade of altruism. Answering the call. Came a modern messiah to save us all. Something far beyond the work of fiction. Positronic brain. A world that's void of all the anguish. And suffering, pain. Better tame your convictions. Before you go and open the cage. We're creating god, master of our designs. We're creating god. Unsure of what we'll find. Never held a high regard for darwin. Selection takes too long. A little kick in the pool. Shouldn't do us wrong. Devouring the very last. Invention man would ever need. But exponential growth. Is a frightening thing, indeed. Sweet bohemian jury rounded up. And hung in the streets. We're creating god, master of our designs. We're creating god. Unsure of what we'll find. Sometimes when I look up. To the sky I have to wonder. Are we ""summoning the demon"" you and I?. Have you noticed. That I'm needin' it more now. More than it needs me. Got a couple of billion. That seem to agree. Surfing in an artificial dimension. But we're not alone. Now the master has become. Just a stepping stone, oh. Like a blow to the ego. The bitter pills are harder to take. We're creating god, master of our designs. We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find. We're creating god, in search of the divine. We're creating god. committing suicide"
crimson day,"Dark years brought endless rain, out in the cold. I lost my way. But storms won't last the clear the air. For something new, the sun came out. And brought you through. A lifetime full of words to say. I hope that time will slow. The passing day. I've been wrong times over. And I've been shamed with no words to find. But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow. Walk with me, crimson day. Don't speak, no use for words. Lie in my arms, sleep secure. I wonder what your dreaming of. Lands rare and far. A timeless flight to reach the stars. A lifetime full of words to say. I hope that time will slow the passing day. I've been wrong times over. And I've been shamed with no words to find. But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow. Walk with me, crimson day. I've come so far to meet you here. To share this life with the one I hold so dear. And I won't speak but what is true. The world outside created just for you. Is for you, for you. I've been wrong times over. And I've been shamed with no words to find. But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow. Walk with me, crimson day"

Either road is plausible on both I could drown. I walked through the center with no rules to guide me. I realize its difficult but now I can see. Oh I hear it now, all the religious rhythms. The left isn't better, its just more of the same. Condemning all these people for what they believe. I'll climb to the top of their mountain again. No one is going to save me this way. And the closer to the top I get the more they take aim. But I'm not you,. I may not be perfect but I've always been true. I may not be worthy in your eyes.

danger line,"My sixteen, locked and loaded. All fear has been avoided. You say the words and my weapon is drawn. This one could be my last time. Some people call it war crime. I may be staring down a lethal sight. (To die). Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole. Leaving my fear on the danger line. Suffering a man should never know. Leaving my faith on the danger line. I do this for my family. My daughter loves her daddy. Too many talk down on things they don't know. With colors never faded. Reckless and unabated. They may take me but never take us all. (I'll crawl). Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole. Leaving my fear on the danger line. Suffering a man should never know. Leaving my faith on the danger line. I know what you're thinking. I've been there before. So think of the times, the time we spent laughing away. So think of the times at home. (Life without a care). Now I find myself in my own blood. (Never thought I'd lay in my own blood). The damage done is far beyond repair. I never put my faith in up above. (Never had much faith in up above). But now, I'm hoping someone's there. I never meant to leave this world alone. I never meant to hurt the ones who cared. And all this time I thought we'd just grow old. You know, no one said it's fair. Tell my baby girl that ""It's alright"". I've sung my last song today. Remind the lord to leave his light on for me. I'm free"

Trapped for eternity.. Black crows break the silence.. The garden of the dead's alive tonight and you can not stop it.. Just enjoy it.. Open up your mind and you will feel it too.. The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.. You can feel the thoughts of the dead.. Feeling the thoughts of the dead.. True or false, it's still there, teaching me.. True or false, still there, teaching me.. You can feel it tonight.. The wood has rotted away.. Take the time absorb it.. Their time is slipping away.. Stone all carved by hand.. Statues that resemble their faces.. They still breathe.. Come join us.. Smell the burning ember's, time flickering away.. Timeless but soon gone.. Timeless but soon gone.. I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts.. As time crumbles away."

I can see just fine,with you in my life,. there by my side as it starts to fade. I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream. a nightmare full of sorrow.. I can see just fine,with you in my life,. there by my side as it starts to fade. I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream. a nightmare full of sorrow."
linoleum,"Possessions never meant anything to me. I'm not crazy (Cause I got none). Well that's not true, I've got a bed and a guitar. And a dog named dog who pisses on my floor. That's right, I've got a floor. So what, so what, so what?. I've got pockets full of kleenex and lint and holes. Where everything important to me just seems to fall. right down my leg. and on to the floor. My closest friend linoleum. Linoleum. Supports my head, give me something to believe. That's me on the beachside combing the sand. Metal meter in my hand. Sporting a pocket full of change. That's me on the street with a violin under my chin. Playing with a grin, singing gibberish. That's me on the back of the bus. That's me in the cell. That's me inside your head. That's me inside your head"
lips of deceit,"The mark I breathe on you.. It's burning through your soul.. The breath I waste.. Losing control.. I bleed in pain.. Testing what I know.. Lips soaked in deceit.. Pull me from here.. No one's innocent.. So why do I feel bad?. But guilt keeps creeping, creeping up on me.. Guilt. Tearing me up inside.. The innocent.. An evil in disguise.. The face of beauty to fall for.. I fall to my knees, deceitful.. Brought down by feelings of regret.. Again your mind has failed the test.. Not everyone feels the same.. Pacifist blinded by the game.. Stand tall. They'll break your heart.. Stand tall. They'll smash your ego.. Stand tall. They'll tear you down.. Stand tall. Scar your soul.. Break your thought.. Fuck your mind.. The mark I breathe on you.. It's burning through your soul.. The breath I waste.. Losing control.. I bleed in pain.. Testing what I know.. Lips soaked in deceit.. Pull me from this hole.. . by Oddy."
lost,"Centuries pass and still the same. War in our blood, some things never change. Fighting for land and personal gain. better your life, justify our pain. The end is knocking. The end is knocking. We've all been lost for most of this life. (lost for most of this life). Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us. And I know that most of us just ain’t right. (most of us just ain’t right). Following the wrong steps, being led by pride. How many lives will we take. How many hearts destined to break. Nowhere to run, can't escape. Full of ourselves, tied to our fate. The end is knocking. The end is knocking, yeah. We've all been lost for most of this life. (lost for most of this life). Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us. And I know that most of us just ain’t right. (most of us just ain’t right). Following the wrong steps, being led by pride. With peace of mind so hard to find. We're dwelling on the drastic signs. Another way to numb our mind. And as you close your eyes tonight. and pray for a better life. you’ll see it flying helplessly away. We've all been lost for most of this life. (lost for most of this life). Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us. And I know that most of us just ain’t right. (most of us just ain’t right). Following the wrong steps, being led by pride"
lost it all,"Run away. I'm living with a hole inside. A piece of me that I have yet to find. The edge of reason, Lies uneven. Turn me off, feel the blood so cold. It's like a product that was bought in salt. Asking me for the impossible. I ain't waiting for a miracle. I ain't waiting for the world to change. Under my skin lives the reason. Under my armor I've lost it all. No more pain. No saviour made of born design. Fool me before I tell ya not this time. Rape my body, Lost my vision, Lost my mind. I had to let it go. Another day living irrational. Another day inside this dying soul. I ain't waiting for a miracle. I ain't waiting for the world to change. Under my skin lives the reason. Under my armor I've lost it all. There's something in your eyes. A part of me that I recognise. I want to let you know. We'd be there if we could and it's alright. You taught me how to feel. It's no wonder I'd do anything. Tell me why'd you have to go. With the ones that come last are the best I know. At times, It seems that we've lost it all. Burn it all. Burn it to the fucking ground. Believe the words that I don't want me around. Life with vision, indecision. World collision and heads will roll. With nothing left except but the pain to show. Mental imagery on the floor. I ain't waiting for a miracle. I ain't waiting for the world to change. Under my skin lives the reason. Under my armor I've lost it all"

These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight.. Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive.. Stranger's blood on my hands, I've shot all I can. There are no silent nights, watching your brothers all die. To destroy all their plans with no thought of me. No thought of me, no thought of me. Ohhhhhhhhhh..... I walked the city lonely. Memories that haunt are passing by. A murderer walks your street tonight. Forgive me for my crimes, don't forget that I was so young. Fought so scared in the name of God and country"

mad hatter,"From the manner of. Cutting whisper. Rising vapors through. Clouds of gold. Giving fire and. Change the demons. With undercurrents. Far too strong to haul. The sun burnt out today. Fools are dancin' in the rain. Stopped by the acid stain. And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain. Nightfall hunts us all. From the shadows. Cynical beauty now. Lies the host. Before the flicker. There's only blackness. The end is coming. All my friends are dead. The sun burnt out today. Fools are dancin' in the rain. Stopped by the acid stain. And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain. Rid by an empty world. Suffer the crushing weight. Madness will crawl inside. Alter the selfish stage. Feeding on the voices in my head. (Slowly we'll learn). (Slowly we'll learn). (Slowly we'll learn). (Slowly we'll learn). (Slowly we'll learn). The unruled hedges we. Turn to someone. All those weeping will. Go unheard. Up on that once green hill. Around the mazes. And seeing the darkness. The jaws will take it slowly. The sun burnt out today. Fools are dancin' in the rain. Stopped by the acid stain. And on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain. Rid by an empty world. Suffer the crushing weight. Madness will crawl inside. Alter the selfish stage. You're feeding all the voices in my head. You're feeding all the voices in my head. They're feeding all the voices in my head. They're feeding all the voices in my head"
natural born killer,"One snap for the dying. One click to end the day. Another story with a mangled scene. It couldn't happen any other way. You wanna talk about it?. I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time. Watch the clock 'til you unwind. You wanna cry about it?. It's making me consider that I lost my mind. The way I see, you must be blind. So this is the world you left behind. This is the guilt that consumes you. So die alone. This is the one thing that I won't do. So say your prayers. 'Cause I ain't leaving here without you. Can't bribe me with money. Can't shower me with shame. Another killer from a broken home. Until you cover me with maniac fame. You wanna know about it?. Well I'mma be fucking with you every time. Story broken, you're behind. And when you ask about it. You can rest assured I'll give you my best side. Seems we all have friends to find. So this is the hate I've been born to. Full of the tales of the untrue. So die alone. This is the one thing that I won't do. So say your prayers. 'Cause I ain't leaving here without you. And I'm waiting. Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by. (and all the promises I'll find). No hesitating,. You've pulled the trigger now your story's left behind. I know you want to see me fry,. Like my soul you won't survive. So die alone. This is the one thing that I won't do. So say your prayers. 'Cause I ain't leaving here without you. To die unknown. Would crush the fish lens we all see through. To kill the glare. Expose the ugliness we hold true"

not ready to die,"Gone, cast away in time. Evil yours, now evil mine. So I robbed you blind. The voices in my head could jest. A less than peaceful side. The endless possibilities. Controlling all 935. You can't break me. Crushed the fears of yesterday. You can't save me. Barriers our trust will fade. I've stood in the dark. Been waiting all this time. While we damn the dead. I'm trying to survive. I'm not ready to die. Damned, watch the masses fall. Burn it down, control 'em all. Help me, make me crawl. To daddy's little girl. To read the writings on the wall. While cast into the nothingness. The final curtain call. You can't break me. Crushed the fears of yesterday. You can't save me. Barriers our trust will fade. I've stood in the dark. Been waiting all this time. While we damn the dead. I'm trying to survive, I'm not ready to die. Through the madness we find. Loyalty is no match for power. Say goodbye to your life, left to rot in. Your darkest hour. Friends won't help you now as long as your mine. You can't break me. Crushed the fears of yesterday. You can't save me. Barriers our trust will fade. I've stood in the dark, been. Waiting all this time. While we damn the dead I'm. Trying to survive. And I'll control the world one. Person at a time. As I damn the dead. I'm trying to survive, I'm not ready to die. Oh!.

nothing to say (ft. slash),"We seem so lost and jaded. Well what a price to pay. Fear can be overstated,. And you seem infatuated. With finding who's to blame.. While it can seem so hard now,. I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way.. Don't tell me it's too late,. Cause I feel it too, we all love to hate. And let others lead the way.. Some searching to find. That life with a new piece of mind.. And still we push further away,. Singing our songs of yesterday.. While so much still stands in our way,. Voices with nothing to say.. Some feel that life's a favour,. While some don't have the time.. Wash up and kiss the alter,. All hail the mighty father,. But love will keep you blind.. Same questions we keep asking,. Won't hear the answers. Cause we're scared of what we'll find. We try and compensate through our troubled faith. That should keep us safe. And keep searching for a sign.. Some searching to find. That life with a new piece of mind.. And still we march further away,. Singing our songs of yesterday.. While so much still stands in our way,. Voices with nothing to say.. There wont be another day, no changing of the seasons,. And no one's gonna save us from the lies.. The greatest story ever told,. Is only what you make it.. There will be struggle and fear,. All by design. And still we march further away (we've been so logicated). Singing our songs of yesterday. (nothing's got all the point, the blame?). While so much still stands in our way (yeahhhh!).

I can't see the things that make true happiness,. I must be blind. Make a joke and I will sigh. and you will laugh and I will cry. Happiness I cannot feel. like love to me is so unreal. And so as you hear these words. telling you now of my state. I tell you to enjoy life. I wish I could but it's too late"
planets,"Godless, meteoric war. Anger, our existence nevermore. You awoke the giants who were dormant in the sky. Comets raining death from a fiery eye!. Mother of all, your time is coming. One with eternity. When planets collide!. Planets collide!. Damage, galaxy destruct. Endless, celestial a bit corrupt. You will be forgotten like the others lost in time. Deaths symbolization, left behind!. Mother of all, your time is coming. One with eternity. When planets collide!. Planets collide!. Take heed the final march is closing in. You can't defeat them on your own. Weapons are longing for the final stand. And their all aimed at you from heaven!. Planets collide!. Planets collide!. Planets collide!. Planets collide!. You will be forgotten like the others lost in time. Deaths symbolization, left behind!. Mother of all, your time is coming. One with eternity. When planets collide!. Planets collide!"
radiant eclipse,"Two nights ago I was shot. A bullet sunk straight through my skull. A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me. No pain as I awoke, but dead. Seeing the face of the man. The time as he lays down his gun. I knew this was going to take place. White silence, so peaceful, so numb. No one knows the time they're changing. No one will see through:. You're all gone to me, (gone to me). I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep. Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe). Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay. Moving on seemed to be somber bliss. Without one goodbye. I watch my Mother shed tears. (and taste the blood she cries. and taste the blood she cries). No:This gun has stopped time in its tracks. Has altered the course of my fate. Destiny is shattered and timeless. Closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace. I'll watch you call, calling for me,. you can't bring back time.... Close your eyes or look away,. fate exposed and won't let me stay. Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,. descending entity in me. My voice has been taken from me.. The more I listen, the more I have to say."
remenissions,"With this ink in our skin we've sealed our fate,. and the axe comes early. (only naturally) So what does that matter?. There's a bed of skeletons waiting for me,. on the other side. They're waiting for my next move (next fatal breath). Human lives to me seem so unreal, can't see through the fog. (nothing past a grey wall) see past the stereotype. Belief, structure built up in you.. I'll tear you down and the one who created you. If they didn't have One how would they act?. If we didn't have hope how would we behave?. Would they still feel remorse. if they slaughtered innocent beings?. Or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane?. A good friend once told me we are our memory. without them we equal nothing. And all I can see is the place I wanna be. Sudeenly my life was so free. Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground. their echoes are reaching my ears. Nights coming fast, suns going down. But keep away from me... keep away from me. (it's hard, to keep me in this place, keep away from me). We may have created the beginning, mentally. We may have created the beginning, physically. To the end of our human existence.... I see through you. The fear that's in your eyes. A good friend once told me we are our memory. Without them we equal nothing. And all I can see is the place I wanna be. Timeless my life was so free. Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground. their echoes are reaching my ears. Nights coming fast, suns going down - confused. I don't know the answers but neither do you"
requiem,"Prodigia. comploratus. Silens, oro. Regnet exitium. Days of warning. Night brings morning. My prayers worthless. Heaven is burning down. I walk stricken. Pitch black vision. Oh One, save me. Caress my weary eyes. Darkest Lord. Your mercy shall I gain. Strike the match. Engulf the earth in flames. In flames. In flames. In flames. Grant them eternal rest,. oh, lord Embrace them. into your army of undead. Strike with vengeance. those who oppose your will. And lay waste. to all the opposition set before you. Walk with them and shield. them from the blinding. light of servitude. And devastate your enemies. as they die by your hand. Amen. Nature quaking. Prophets aching. I kneel faithful. Damnation cracks the sky. My heart fiction. Superstition. Your grace deathless. Give life to my last breath. Darkest Lord. Your mercy shall I gain. Strike the match. Engulf the earth in flames. In flames. In flames. In flames. Rise from ashes. Violence clashes my soul vacant. Cleanse me of all this sin. I stand guilty. I bleed filthy. Born of fire. Savor this final hour. Darkest Lord. Your mercy shall I gain. Strike the match. Engulf the earth in flames. In flames. In flames. In flames"
retrovertigo,Before you advertise. All the fame is implied. With no fortune unseen. Sell the rights. To your blight. Time-machine. While I'm dulled by excess. And a cynic at best. My art imitates crime. Paid for by. The allies. So invest. Now I'm finding truth is a ruin. Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing. Staring into glassy eyes. Mesmerized. There's a vintage thirst returning. But I'm sheltered by my channel-surfing. Every famine virtual. Retrovertigo. A tribute to false memories. With conviction. Cheap imitation. Is it fashion or disease?. Post-ironic. Remains a mouth to feed. Sell the rights. To your blight. And you'll eat. See the vintage robot wearied. Then awakened by revision theories. Every famine virtual. Retrovertigo
roman sky,"As the embers rose through the roman sky. Tell me were you calm, when they took your life?. Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow. Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door. Shine forever true. Shared with us the world well, before your time. Though they took your voice, words forever shine. Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow. Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door. Shine forever true. As they spoke your fate, a fearless man replied. ""As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"". Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow. Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door. Shine forever true"
runaway (feat. warren fitzgerald),"As I walk along. I wonder what went wrong. With our love, a love that was so strong. And as I still walk on. I think of the things we've done. Together, a-while our hearts were young. I'm a-walkin' in the rain. Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain. Wishin' you were here by me. To end this misery. And I wonder. I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder. Why. Why, why, why, why, why she ran away. And I wonder. A-where she will stay-ay. My little runaway. Run, run, run, run, runaway. I'm a-walkin' in the rain. Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain. Wishin' you were here by me. To end this misery. I wonder. I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder. Why. Why, why, why, why, why she ran away. And I wonder. A-where she will stay-ay. My little runaway. Run, run, run, run, runaway. Run, run, run, run, runaway. Run, run, run, run, runaway. Run, run, run, run, runaway"
save me,"Skull!. They all know, they all know!. Sorry, did I wake your dream?. Some questions run too deep. We only, only wake up when we sleep. Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we'd find. Lost our way tonight. Is it something we said?. Is it something we said to them?. Is it something we said?. Save me - I'm trapped in a vile world. Save me - Where the ending's all the same as every. other. We're only here to die. Save me - I'm losing my only dream. Save me - I can use some guiding light, some place to go. If you hear me, let me know. They all know, they all know!. Ever since the day you left my fates been set unknown. How many years to walk this path alone?. So much to see tonight,. so why'd you close your eyes?. Why can't I shut mine?. Is it something we did?. Is it something we did to them?. Is it something we did?. Save me - I'm trapped in a vile world. Save me - Where the ending's all the same as every other. We're only here to die. Save me - I'm losing my only dream. Save me - I can use some guiding light, some place to go. If you hear me, let me know. If you hear me, let me know. Help me find my way. Said help me find my way. No pulse inside of me. Stone cold lips and heresy. All lies and to a degree. Losing you I wanna be, oh. You'll find out right now,. He may be out of his mind, but someday you will find. That sanity has left us all blind,. and dragged us all behind. A moment seen through those eyes, crystal blue disguise. They say that all beauty must die,. I say it just moves on. If you'd only open your mind,. then someday you will find. Insanity left us behind,. and walked right through the door. I can see the picture's clear as yesterday, pictures all my own. I can hear the voices begging you to stay,. but know you're not alone. Save me - I'm trapped in a vile world. Save me - Where the ending's all the same as every other. We're only here to die. Save me - I'm losing my only dream. Save me - I can use some guiding light, some place to go. If you hear me, let me know. If you hear me, let me know. Tonight we all die young. Tonight we all die young. Tonight we all die young. Tonight we all die young. Tonight we all die young. Tonight we all die young. Tonight we all die. Tonight we all die young"

scream,"Caught up in this madness too blind to see. Woke animal feelings in me. Took over my sense and I lost control. I'll taste your blood tonight. You know I make you wanna scream. You know I make you wanna run from me baby. but know it's too late you've wasted all your time. Relax while you're closing your eyes to me. So warm as I'm setting you free. With your arms by your side there's no struggling. Pleasure's all mine this time. You know I make you wanna scream. You know I make you wanna run from me baby. but know it's too late you've wasted all your time. Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring. Cover me, unwanted clemency. Scream till there's silence. Scream while there's life left, vanishing. Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire perishing. We've all had a time where we've lost control. We've all had our time to grow. I'm hoping I'm wrong but I know I'm right. I'll hunt again one night. You know I make you wanna scream. You know I make you wanna run from me baby. but know it's too late you've wasted all your time.

second heartbeat,"Gone. We keep writing, talking and planning. but everything's changing. We all know what to do but know one does it. Now this time has passed and full of regret. Two in my heart have left me a while. I stand alone. When they get back, it won't be the same. Never be the same. My life, you've always been there. Now you're gone and my heads spinning. Left the childhood, left the memories. left the good times in the past. Moving on your time has run out. Wishing the clock would stand still. the world can wait. Wasting away once again, once lived as friends. [Chorus]. As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life. The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night. Never will I forget you, and all the memories past. So rarely I get to see your face. Growing I looked to you in guidance. We knew that time would kill us. but you're still so close to me. To me you were my life. To me you were my soul companion. Now you are so far away. Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had. Come back - to the days when we were young. Come back - to the days when nothing mattered. I feel time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life. The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night. As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life. The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night"
seize the day,"Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost. It's empty and cold without you here,. Too many people to ache over. I see my vision burns,. I feel my memories fade with time. But I'm too young to worry. These streets we travel on. Will undergo our same lost past. I found you here, now please just stay for a while. I can move on with you around. I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?. I'd do anything for a smile,. Holding you 'til our time is done. We both know the day will come,. But I don't want to leave you. I see my vision burn,. I feel my memories fade with time. But I'm too young to worry. (a melody, a memory, or just one picture). Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost. It's empty and cold without you here,. Too many people to ache over. Newborn life replacing all of us,. Changing this fable we live in. No longer needed here so where should we go?. Will you take a journey tonight,. Follow me past the walls of death?. But girl, what if there is no eternal life?. I see my vision burn,. I feel my memories fade with time. But I'm too young to worry. (a melody, a memory, or just one picture). Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost. Its empty and cold without you here,. Too many people to ache over. Trails in life, questions of us existing here,. Don't wanna die alone without you here. Please tell me what we have is real. So, what if I never hold you, or kiss your lips again?. So I never want to leave you. And the memories for us to see. I beg don't leave me. Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost. Its empty and cold without you here,. Too many people to ache over. Trails in life, questions of us existing here,. Don't wanna die alone without you here. Please tell me what we have is real. (silence you lost me, no chance for one more day). I stand here alone. Falling away from you,. No chance to get back home"
shattered by broken dreams,"I see you fading away from us.. I'll miss you very much.. Room with empty bottles, broken dreams,. and pride still running high, always on your side.. But I wanted more for you.. You can't go on this way.. And now I see it all fall through.. We pray for better days.. Stuck alone and scared.. Throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.. I don't want to see you like this.. We all tried to save you but missed.. I still feel the hope on your road.. Now come back to us like the days of the old.. I still feel you there, trying to get on top.. You'll always have my support, in my heart.. People you've hurt.. Friends that you've lied to.. But we understand, and that's not (you) can see the end of the road,. I can see it too, for you, I'm scared, if I lose you, I'm not prepared.. This time, if you die.. I watch you, right before my eyes.. Just trust me, and listen.. You have no self control.. This will take your life.. Overdose and then indulge until you die.. Pondering, we all ask the question why.. Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad.. And we are left the only family that you've ever had.. Overdose and then indulge until you die.. Pondering, we all ask the question why.. Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad.. And we are left the only family that you've ever had.. I wanted more for you.. You can't go on this way.. And now I see it all fall through.. We pray for better days.. Stuck alone and scared.. Throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.. Help you see it through.. Fight this me and you.. Reaching deep inside.. Problems not just you is what we find.. Our friendship makes it mine."
shepherd of fire,"Let's take a moment and break the ice. So my intentions are known. See, I have pity in watching you suffer. I know the feeling of being damned alone. I got a storybook of my own. Don't you see. I am your pride. Agent of wealth. Bearer of needs?. (And you know it's right). I am your war. Arming the strong. Aiding the weak. Know me by name. Shepherd of fire. Well, I can promise you paradise. No need to serve on your knees. And when you're lost in the darkest of hours. Take a moment and tell me who you see. Won't tell you who not to be. Now you know. I am your pride. Agent of wealth. Bearer of needs. (And you know it's right). I am your war. Arming the strong. Aiding the weak. Know me by name. Shepherd of fire. Disciple of the cross, champion in the suffering. Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption. Harden your mind from the chains of the divine. Make way to Shepherd of Fire. Through the ages of time (time, time, time). I've been known for my hate (hate, hate, hate). But I'm a dealer of simple choices. For me it's never too late. I am your pride. Agent of wealth. Bearer of needs. (And you know it's right). I am your war. Arming the strong. Aiding the weak. Know me by name. Shepherd of fire. I am your wrath. I am your guilt. I am your lust. (And you know it's right). I am your law. I am your scar. I am your trust. Know me by name. Shepherd of fire"
sidewinder,"I slide through the wasteland that's my world. My hunger takes your life, preyed on to keep me alive, yeah. Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty in me. Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night. You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite. That's right I shed my skin tonight but my fangs are hard to hide. And you know that you're going to die, yeah. Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty to me. Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night. You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite. I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control. Fire that burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside. Making my way through the night you're still in my sight. You're runnin' away cuz ya know you can't hide. My instincts are cold blooded hate; to you I'm the bearer of fate. Wrong place and now the wrong time, now terror is all that you'll find. Can't you feel the poison rising straight to the heart from the venomous bite. Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night. You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite. I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control. Fire that burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside. Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone. Vanish from my sites - venomous control. You won't make it right - my appetite has grown. Lost your final fight - no love will be shown. Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone. Vanish from my sites - venomous control. You can't make it right - my appetite has grown. Lost your final fight - no love will be shown"
simulation,"It seems I should have walked away. Reverse the wager I've no means to pay. Toto has pulled back the green tonight. In sight. And blue pills coat with such disdain. I wore the shades for so long. That I've forgotten how to see. The curtain rises. But who dares to pull the strings. I know this may be hard. For you to believe in all. But you only exist because we allow it. I question all the voices in my head. Are they mine or have I been misled?. Total understanding doesn't seem. To mean a thing. When you can't see behind the silver screen. A figurine. Can't you hear me scream?. By the way of cosmic rays. A subtle breakdown jarred the code display. A simulation as I can tell, our cell. Playing out a hopeless scene. We stand to lose all our charm. And faith just seems to wane. A billion years can seem. A stunningly short time. You've been beaten down time and time again. But still you find yourself. At the center of it all. I question all the voices in my head. Are they mine or have I been misled?. Total understanding doesn't seem. To mean a thing. When you can't see behind the silver screen. A figurine. Can't you hear me scream?. You hear me. You had one thing to do, one thing. And you fucked it up, piece of shit. Nurse, patient 666158 needs to be sedated. We need 500 ccs of Blue Comfort. Oh hello there, dearie. I've been expecting you. Posturing the way I feel. Is truth only what we believe is real?. Marvel the sketches that paint the night. Starlight. And take a breath before it's all erased away"
so far away,"Never feared for anything. Never shamed but never free. A life to heal the broken heart with all that it could. Lived the life so endlessly. Saw beyond what others see. I tried to heal your broken heart. with all that I could. Will you stay?. Will you stay away forever?. How do I live without the ones I love?. Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned. Place and time always on my mind. I have so much to say but you're so far away. Plans of what our futures hold. Foolish lies of growing old. It seems we're so invincible. The truth is so cold. A final song, a last request. A perfect chapter to laid the rest. Now and then I try to find a place in my mind. Where you can stay. You can stay awake forever. How do I live without the ones I love?. Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned. Place and time always on my mind. I have so much to say but you're so far away. Sleep tight, I'm not afraid. The ones that we love are here with me. Lay away a place for me. Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way. To live eternally. How do I live without the ones I love?. Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned. Place and time always on my mind. And the light you left remains but its so hard to stay. When I have so much to say and you're so far away..... I love you. You were ready. The pain is strong and urges rise. But I'll see you. When He lets me. Your pain is gone, your hands untied. So far away. And I needed to know. So far away. And I need you to. need you to know"
st. james,"This is the story of a man, who conquered life drink in hand. Ship unmanned. Marked by genius, channelled good,. By some a bit misunderstood. They'd been wrong many times before. Some times our saints are sinners. They blur the lines and lead the way. Their way. Raise hell and a glass in reverence. The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints. Never a stranger to late night, snake bite, fist fights. And empty pints. Unrivaled heights. He led with songs, they sang along,. Created bonds that held so strong. Some were right and some were wrong. Some times our saints are sinners. They blur the lines and lead the way. Their way. Raise hell and a glass in reverence. The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints. It's by the sea and at nights end. That's when the sin and swill begin. That's when he had that certain light inside his head. For every whisper he would scream, for every draught. He shared a drink. For every sorrow there is a light from our st. james. On the sea by the cliff he watches, he waits the night to see. The day - his way. Last call will find us all. But there's a light that leads the way, our way. Some times our saints are sinners. They blur the lines and lead the way. Their way. Raise hell and a glass in reverence. The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints"
streets,"You live your whole life staring at a wall, your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.. You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?. There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.. The ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live.. One groups taught how and the other group is taught why.. There's no need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.. No reason to tell you which way to be cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.. Look what's happening now.. What are the reasons why and how?. And don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated. different cause they're not the same as me or you?.

strength of the world,"My story starts the day they said ""she cant be found"". The news so dark, heart stopped, I stood silent without a sound. It's over, she's finished, mother lies with my father and sister too. Cold-blooded, they suffered, shot down by the outlaws after you. Sorrow swallows my screams. Strength of the world - is on my shoulders. Strength of the world - is on my side. Strength of the world - the one true beholder. Ice in my veins - for those who've died. I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life. There's nothing left to say. Avenge the dead kill all who cross me in my path. Suicidal, I never planned on coming back. I want it, I need it, revenge is dripping from my teeth. Need nothin', to feel power, and bring the killers to their knees. Nothin' ta lose vengeance ta gain (you know I'll never be the same). So taste my breath I'm close behind you (so desperate on your final day). Sorrow swallows my screams. Strength of the world - is on my shoulders. Strength of the world - is on my side. Strength of the world - the one true beholder. Ice in my veins - for those who've died. I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life. There's nothing left to say. Sitting in silence with heaven above me I prayed every night by their graves. While I thirst for closure I feel it no longer. I can't turn my cheek away. I stand before you; I'll sin when I have to. But now I leave your side, to avenge my family's pride. I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life. There's nothing left to say. Strength of the world - is on my shoulders. Strength of the world - is on my side. Strength of the world - the one true beholder. Ice in my veins - for those who've died. So far forever now alone, a greater punishment on me has been imposed. A killer falling from the light, I miss my family, I'll never be alright"
sunny disposition,We've been through hell. Sewn up our eyes. Found fuel in meds. Viewed through the narrow. Encouraged fear when so inclined. Bought peace through wars. That doomed our children to die. Ego is sure to fix the world. Served up to happy boys and girls. I'd make a decision if granted the privilege. But I'm afraid my taste is unrefined. And no one likes cheap wine. When the clouds kiss your eye. Shadows stain on the high-rise. Raise your thumb to the sky. Fossilize. You own the burg. We sleep in streets. You dine then waste. We forage to eat. Well who pays the tab. When you cross the line?. Who writes the check?. Who's herding the swine?. Just takes a fence to rule the roost. As long as the scale has been reduced. How can we see the outside of the pen. When survival has possession of our minds?. Calmly walk the line. When the clouds kiss your eye. Shadows stain on the high-rise. Raise your thumb to the sky. Fossilize. All good things come with time. When you know then you'll know. Such a marvelous find in an illusion. (vlader lauder sat in sorrow. For all his teeth had gone. He drank sweet rum. While fingering his gun. And eyeballed a feast. Not one bite he could eat. Somebody cut off his head!). Dear radiation my sweet friend. Let agents dance upon my nerves. Let sunlight glow under my skin. Let toxins seep into my soul. When the clouds kiss your eye. Shadows stain on the high-rise. Raise your thumb to the sky. Fossilize. All good things come with time. When you know then you'll know. Such a marvelous time. I will find in an illusion. It's an illusion
tension,"I wake up every morning bright and early. Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone. Tension is pulling me in all directions. And all these problems use me as a rope. Sometimes the pressure will just drive me crazy. At any time I could explode. I need some piece of mind, its got me tired. Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road. I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin. We all need a moment in our lives. Work's hard, the day's too long. And that's just where it begins. Tension has had us all this time. I sit in traffic every single morning. Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind. Making the money so I feed my family. But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time. I got no free days on my busy schedule. I turn the page and it's the same. Don't like my situation, you don't either. Don't wanna look back scared of working life away. I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin. We all need a moment in our lives. Work's hard, the day's too long. And thats just where it begins. Tension has had us all this time. But every now and then. I drive alone. An open road. Hot summer days. A gentle breeze that feels alright. Home alone. And I can't feel the pain. Only strain. Enjoy the sights. I feel alive. When actually here just feels alright. Far from home. I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin. We all need a moment in our lives. Works hard, the days too long. And thats just where it begins. Tension has had us all this time"
the art of subconscious illusion,"A living nightmare, asleep but still aware.. The endless torture.. The painless pleasure.. I grasp myself.. Trying to regain control.. I experience and learn.. In another faction of my mind.. So confused.. But everything makes perfect sense.. Can't feel the pain.. Emotional pain's so much deadlier.. Lost, you've just been raped.. Pain. Your friends can't help you.. Why won't they help you? Another reality.. This can't be happening.. Why is this happening?. Who the fuck are you?. Who the fuck. Are you?. Trying hard to figure out what's done.. I scramble but now I run.. The images in my head.. All the problems that I've been fed.. Punching slowly my mind can't change the speed.. As my victims bleed.. No matter what I do or how hard I try.. I can't use my abilities.. Use my abilities.. Art of Illusion.. My razor sharp knife's edge, pierces my victim's body.. But I can't take their soul.. Punching through jello, stabbing not killing.. Disappointment. Discomfort."

My old man is all I'm meant to be.. This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired. All your ideas are so plainly uninspired.. Takes more than one idea. More than one person to fight the fight. How many times have you taught and not conspired?. Don't wanna be, they never say. But don't call us the liars. . We've walked these alleys a thousand times. And scattered around a thousand lies.. They are trying to hold you till youll die,. it may be hard but keep your feet on the ground.. Why don't I have the finer, things that others have. (things that others have). The chance is there if you want it all that bad.. So bad.. Don't take your oppression out on me.. My old man is all I'm meant to be.. This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired. All your ideas are so painful or not uninspired.. Takes more than one idea. More than one person to fight the fight. How many times have you taught and not conspired?. Don't try and get me confused.. Cause I do understand.. And sometimes people need help.. That they may need a hand. When this problems going on.. A thing you have to get straight. Is that you don't own my hand.. And I don't owe you a thing.. So don't think about how sorry. You feel when now your treated so bad.. This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired. All your ideas are so plainly uninspired.. Takes more than one idea. More than one person to fight the fight. How many times have you taught and not conspired. And as a race we look back and we've come so far.. While some may conquer the others have had it so hard. But instead we just complain while there's no one for. us to fight.. I guess we're born in it and its how we keep our side. to pay.. .

the stage,"So I arrived, naked and cold. A welcomed change from the abeyance. Of a ghost town catacomb. No need for counsel I appreciate the time. I'm not alone. (why don't you get my lawyer on the phone). There were days, these child eyes. Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize. I found my heart for the first time. And I awakened in me. I left myself to navigate and oh I felt control. (It seems these sheep have quite an appetite). Who is the crowd. That peers through the cage. As we perform here, upon the stage. As the boy, became a man. In came a calm sophistication. I can hardly understand. So lost in ego. Didn't notice when the time had slipped away. (yeah, everybody's got a sob story). Jesus christ, was born to die. Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize. We're simply sociopaths with no communication baby. I see your angle but we differ. From our points of view. (so tell me, what's your cross to bear). Who is the crowd that peers through the cage. As we perform here upon the stage. Tell me a lie in a beautiful way. I believe in answers just not today. Hope my wheels don't abandon me now. Seein' that I'm out here alone. I'm runnin' out of fight. And the wind speaks a comforting voice. Guiding me to her arms. Mother, I'm alright. It took the birth of sin. To snake-rattle the mind. Before a blow to the head. By the gavel of time to wake up. Won't you wake up?. When did the walking apes. Decide that nuclear war. Was the only solution. For them keeping the score. Just wake up. Can't you wake up?. (Do you know this is just a simulation don't you?). Who is the crowd that peers through the cage. As we perform here upon the stage. Tell me a lie in a beautiful way. I believe in answers just not today"
the wicked end,"Man's becoming more corrupt now, godless,. wicked, and cruel. The soulless man stood silenced, Mary's ""word"" rang. so true. Chastisement worse than the flood, spread the word. its all through. Don't kill the messenger girl. As if we haven't swam enough. in this life of misery. Voice your prophecy, shed some light. feel sorrow for mankids's chance to survive. Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears. A stab in the dark but it wounded our will. We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for. one last time. We've grown into the number six hundred sixty six. War breaks, a sign of the end, eternally expelled. Look to the sky for knowledge,. the stars align tonight. Eclipse and heaven shall fall. Now I know I've seen it all in my life of misery. Voice your prophecy, shed some light. feel sorrow for mankids's chance to survive. Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears. A stab in the dark but it wounded our will. Dust the apple off, savor each bite. And deep inside you know Adam was right. lust and power, indulgence, no fear. Left with his sins, how does this end?. We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for. one last time. As the prophets shed the light on what's to. come the crowds did gather. Your time is precious, they explained,. no time to worry, Messiah's coming. Don't go to sleep tonight, darling, hold me in your arms. These will be our final days and I can't let go. Walls are falling, churches burning, women ravaged,. children crying. Flesh is tearing, some still fighting. In this world of misery. Voice your prophecy, shed some light. feel sorrow for mankids's chance to survive. Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears. A stab in the dark but it wounded our will. Dust the apple off, savor each bite. And deep inside you know Adam was right. lust and power, indulgence, no fear. Left with his sins, how does this end?.

this means war,"Hide my face again. Harbor in the shadows. Feel this weight of sin. Hammering away. Die with the guilt. Of a thousand AWOL soldiers. Die watch the scythe usher me astray. I can't go on this way. Not as I am today. The ugly side of me is strong. Take aim, a loaded gun. Pull back on all who run. A coward's truth inside the wrong. This means war. This means war. This means war. Lash your tongue of bane. Carry me to nowhere. Mental holocaust. Battle never ends. Lie, mask the pain. Of a child who's forsaken. Lie to myself. Praise the new regime. I left me long ago. Reasons you'll never know. No one to miss me when I'm gone. With no more words to say. No argument to stay. Another post I don't belong. This means war. This means war. This means war. This means war. This means war. No home to call my own. No finding someone new. No one to break the fall. No one to see me through. No name to carry on. No promise for today. No one to hear the call. No tattered flag to raise. Walk the razor's edge. Cut into the madness. Question all you trust. Buy into the fear. I see the man ripping at my soul now. I, I know the man. I know him all too well. There's nothing here for free. Lost who I want to be. My serpent blood can strike so cold. On any given day. I'll take it all away. Another thought I can't control. This means war. This means war. This means war. This means war. This means war"

tonight the world dies,"Lost the meaning of our stay. Learn to live another day. Doubt the choices that we made,. I know that we can't hide our shame. It's only in disguise. Drowning in our own debris. Full of thoughts as though we're free. Close our eyes so we can see. The depth of all we mean to be. If only in my eyes. I don't mind - read the writing on the wall. Mother cries - tortured voices as we crawl. Find me on my better days to lose it once again.... In a way. So try and love me while you can. And take the time to understand. As long as I can touch your face. You know I'll never leave this place. If only in my mind. I don't mind - read the writing on the wall. Mother cries - tortured voices as we crawl. Find me on my better days to lose it once again.... But I seem to find no better ways. to consciously pretend. Silence all I wanna say. With tendencies to run away, I run away. With you tonight. Launder all my sins away. And just like that mistakes are made, you know. Tonight the world dies. I don't mind - read the writing on the wall. Mother cries - tortured voices as we crawl. Find me on my better days to lose it once again.... But I seem to find no better ways. to consciously pretend"

unbound (the wild ride),"Somewhere life is good, and things go as they should. It's hard to find, but that's alright yeah. Searching for the way, push harder everyday. It's deep inside, that shining light yeah. But I'm scarred, by barriers placed in my path. I'm scathed. This ride that takes me through life. Leads me into darkness but emerges into light. No one can ever slow me down. I'll stay unbound. Sometimes when we're young, and always on the run. It gets so dark and I know that place yeah. So don't be too concerned, you've got a lot to learn. Well so do I and we've got plenty of time yeah. Don't fall off the track yet with so many races to go. Hold on. This ride that takes me through life. Leads me into darkness but emerges into light. No one can ever slow me down. I'll stay unbound. Some live so wrong, and what we do is each his own. But living in fear, endless shame for countless years. I never lived in fear I knew i'd die another day. I never viewed my life as something... Slipping away. Some live so wrong, and what we do is each his own. But living in fear, endless shame for countless years. I never lived in fear I knew i'd die another day. I never viewed my life as something... Slipping away.

unholy confessions,"I'll try, she said as he walked away. Try not to lose you. Two vibrant hearts could change. Nothing tears the being more than deception. Unmasked fear. I'll be here waiting, tested and secure. Nothing hurts my world. Just affects the ones around me. When sin's deep in my blood. You'll be the one to fall. I wish I could be the one. The one who won't care at all. But being the one on the stand. I know the way to go, no one's guiding me. When time soaked with blood turns its back. I know it's hard to fall. Confined in me was your heart. I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me. Nothing will last in this life. Our time is spent constructing. Now you're perfecting a world meant to sin. Constrict your hands around me. Squeeze till I cannot breathe. This air tastes dead inside me. Contribute to our plague. Break all your promises. Tear down this steadfast wall. Restraints are useless here. Tasting salvation's near. Nothing hurts my world. just affects the ones around me. When sin's deep in my blood. You'll be the one to fall. I wish I could be the one. the one who won't care at all. But being the one on the stand. I know the way to go, no one's guiding me. When time soaked with blood turns its back.

until the end,"Weekends on young and angry street. We meet, drink 'till trouble found us there. Living life as without a care. We've had our bouts, been black and blue.

Life moves on, can't stay the same. But some of us, some worry. While some have gone their separate ways. Theres some still i caught up with the past instead. But move on, you're missing most of your life. They say its hard to stay the same. When some fail. While other men seem to gain, but friends. I'll be with you here until the end. (Until the End). Don't change the way you think of me. We're from the same story. Life moves on, can't stay the same. But some of us, some worry. We're all falling forward. With no signs of slow. And some moving faster. But that's all that I wanted. I wanted. Ya know it's hard. It's passing by. Memories. Be out all night. So reminisce won't bring you back. Just look ahead and hold on tight. We're all falling forward. With no signs of slow. And some moving faster. But that's all that I wanted. I wanted. Don't change the way you think of me. Oh yeah. Until the end. Until the end.
