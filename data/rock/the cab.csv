vegas skies,"It’s twelve o’ clock and I need your attention. It’s like the alcohol making my head spin. Send me the one the room is a bottle. Keeping me hopeless ‘til I wake tomorrow. And if tonight ever makes a difference. The way that I feel the way that I’ll remember it. I’ll take this down until the glass remains. Swallow the words that I was meant to say. It’s a long drive back to Vegas skies. So I don’t, I make one more wrong turn tonight so. Say goodnight our first goodbye. I’ve only got forever and forever is fine. Just take your time. We’ll stop the clock together. And know that the timing was right. All of these guards they stand tall and defensive. Putting up walls around what was once innocent. It won’t let me in but I’m stronger than that. Cuz you stole my eyes and I’ll never look back. Girl last night I forgot to mention. The way that I feel the way that I’ll remember this. When we’re this young we have nothing to lose. We just the clock to beat and a hand to choose. It’s a long drive back to Vegas skies. So I don’t, I make one more wrong turn tonight so. Say goodnight our first goodbye. I’ve only got forever and forever is fine. Just take your time. We’ll stop the clock together. And know that the timing was right. It’s a long way down. Just fall into place and you’ll fall into me. We’ll make it out you’ll see. So say goodnight our first goodbye. I’ve only got forever and forever is fine. Just take your time. We’ll stop the clock together. And say goodnight our first goodbye. I’ve only got forever and forever is fine. Just take your time. We’ll stop the clock together. And know that the timing was right"

Say goodbye. Like Prince said. Forever forever is a mighty long time. Forever forever is a mighty long time. Cause I can wait for you to run my way. Forever be mine. Heart break. You make it too easy. Don't you see. It's a mistake?. Spilled words. Were meant to stun you. Whip lash. It's time to fly away. [Bridge]. [Chorus]. [Guitar Solo]. Forever forever is a mighty long time. Forever forever is a mighty long time. Cause I can wait for you to run my way. Forever be mine. (x2)
