only hope,There's a song that's inside my soul. It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again. I'm awake in the infinite cold. But you sing to me over and over again. So I lay my head back down. And I lift my hands and pray to be only yours. I pray to be only yours. I know now you're my only hope. Sing to me the songs of the stars. Of your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again. When I feel like my dreams are so far. Sing to me of the plans that you have for me over again. So I lay my head back down. And I lift my hands and pray to be only yours. I pray to be only yours. I know now you're my only hope. I give you my destiny. I'm giving you all of me. I want your symphony. Singing in all that I am. At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back. So I lay my head back down. And I lift my hands and pray to be only yours. I pray to be only yours. I pray to be only yours. I know now you're my only hope
prodigal soul,"The sun comes up alone. Like a funeral for my home. Like a mirror for my soul. But I should've known better. I was feeling like skin and bones. I kept chasing after these ghost. I kept giving up these hopes. When I found your letter. I am Yours and Yours alone. Forgive me for my wandering on my own. I'm a prodigal soul. And I want to come home. I can't make it alone. Won't You bring me home?. Tried to start on something new. Tried to blame myself on You. But my nightmares all came true. I felt so unsteady. I still see Your face when I close my eyes and. I think about You wide awake at night and. How far do I have to go to realize. What I know already. I am Yours and Yours alone. Forgive me for my wandering on my own. I'm a prodigal soul. I was running on empty. I was feeling so low. When You made me a promise. To never let me go. I was falling to pieces. When You carried me home. When You told me you loved me. And my prodigal soul. In my dreams, all is forgiven. In my dreams, I'm by Your side. But when I wake up somethings missing. Can You free me from my prodigal soul?. Won't You bring me home?"
let it happen,"This life is hollow and mostly borrowed. The voices are screaming but where is the meaning?. Noisy crescendos behind closed windows. The floor is a ceiling, I can't find the feeling. Oh, tell me, love, tell me. Am I dreaming, and where is the meaning?. Oh, tell me, love. Let it happen, let it happen. Tomorrow knows what tomorrow knows. You can't make it get here sooner. Let it happen, let it happen. I don't hold what the future holds. But I know you're my future. The fever is breaking, my body is aching. What's with defending if everything's ending?. The current is endless, the river relentless. Love, tell me, love. Oh, am I dreaming, and what is the meaning?. Love, tell me, love, tell me. Let it happen, let it happen. Tomorrow knows what tomorrow knows. You can't make it get here sooner. Let it happen, let it happen. I don't hold what the future holds. But I know you're my future. Let it happen, let it happen.

I couldn't find the floor. I couldn't find the floor. And you walked away. And I saw fireworks imploding. Frame by frame. Like watching a movie in slow motion. From miles away. Up like a rocket ship ascends. Drifting up into space. And I'm running out of oxygen. Can't go back to the first. Losing stories like leap year. Fake smiles and worse. Just a ghost left to be near. I'm not sure how this works. What do you want me to say, dear?. All I know is it hurts. All I know is it hurts. I'm drifting out of the hemisphere. So far away. All of the memories disappear. And start to fade away"

all i need,"Sometimes I feel so small. Like a picture on your wall. Like Im hanging on just to fall. No matter how I try. So love sing to me gentle. That Im more than accidental. More than just inconsequential. Burning out tonight. All I need is the air I breathe. The time we share. And the ground beneath my feet. All I need is the love that I believe in. Tell me love, do you believe in me. Theres a place down by the ocean. Where I take my mixed emotions. When my souls rocked by explosions. Of these tired times. Where love sings to me slowly. Even when I feel low and lonely. Even when the road feels like. The only friend of mine. One light. One goal. One feeling in my soul. One fight. One hope. One twisting rope. Im ready to run where the ocean meets the sky"

And I began to believe that all we are is material. It's nonsensical. So you walk outside and everything's new. You're looking at the world with new eyes. As if you'd never seen the sky before this blue. As if you've never seen the sky in your whole life. And then the phone rings. As it turns out you are already late. And now you're wondering. Is peace just a temporary state. Waiting tables and parking cars. You've been selling cell phones at the shopping mall. And you began to believe that all you are is material. It's nonsensical. I'm so sorry I've been so down. I started doubting things could ever turn around. But I still can't believe that all we are. And that all of our dreams are nothing more than material. Souls aren't built of stone, sticks and bones. Souls aren't built of stone. Souls aren't built of stone, sticks and bones"

all i need,"Sometimes I feel so small. Like a picture on your wall. Like Im hanging on just to fall. No matter how I try. So love sing to me gentle. That Im more than accidental. More than just inconsequential. Burning out tonight. All I need is the air I breathe. The time we share. And the ground beneath my feet. All I need is the love that I believe in. Tell me love, do you believe in me. Theres a place down by the ocean. Where I take my mixed emotions. When my souls rocked by explosions. Of these tired times. Where love sings to me slowly. Even when I feel low and lonely. Even when the road feels like. The only friend of mine. One light. One goal. One feeling in my soul. One fight. One hope. One twisting rope. Im ready to run where the ocean meets the sky"

amateur lovers,Everyone I know. Needs love like drugs. Like a common cold. We could never shrug. My baby and me. We're missing the same stuff. We've all got a disease. Deficiency of love.

I can tell you what you're thinking now. Before you think that you can settle down. We don't know what we're doing. Let's do it again. You tried to play it down. But it never stuck. I tried to build this town. I'm getting no such luck. When nobody's around. I keep my eyes on the clock. There ain't a cure I've found. In all my times around this block. Everyday we still try. Every night we still cry. Driving home on the 405. We don't know what we're doing. We do it again. We're just amateur lovers. With amateur friends. I can tell you what you're thinking now.

american dream,"When success is equated with excess. The ambition for excess wrecks us. As the top of the mind becomes the bottom line. When success is equated with excess. If your time ain't be nothing for money. I start to feel really bad for you honey. Maybe honey put your money where your mouth's been running. If your time ain't be nothing but money. I want out of this machine. It doesn't feel like freedom. (chorus). This ain't my American dream. I want to live and die for bigger things. I'm tired of fighting for just me. This ain't my American dream. When success is equated with excess. When we're fighting for the beamer, the lexus. As the heart and soul breathing the company goals. Where success is equated with excess. I want out of this machine. It doesn't feel like freedom. (chorus). Cause baby's always talkin 'bout a ring. And talk has always been the cheapest thing. Is it true would you do what I want you to. If I show up with the right amount of bling?. Like a puppet on a monetary string. Maybe we've been caught singing. Red, white, blue, and green. But that ain't my America,. That ain't my American dream"

amy's song,"Amy's gone. And time rolls on. How far? how fast? how long?. The last time we saw Amy. She was headed for the shore. Fighting off the volatile gray skies. She said now begins forever. And that no one knows their time. We bid farewell not knowing. That might be our last good-bye. Amy was a fighter. She cut like Casius Clay. She burned like a fire. Despite these rains. Where time was a question. She only knew one song:. She's singing, ""how far, how fast, how. long?"". Salvation is a fire. In the midnight of the soul. It lights up like a can of gasoline. Yeah, she's a freedom fighter. She's a stand up kind of girl. She's out to start a fire. In a bar code plastic world. When everything stops moving. And I stop to catch my breath. And ride my train of thought. All the way round. My thoughts return to Amy. And the fire she's begun. She came when we were freezing. And left us burning up."
another christmas (old borego),"(Yeah!. Whatever. One, two, three. It’s almost Christmas/New Year). I’ve seen snow on Christmas Eve,. Gracing frosted evergreens. After most the trees go brown.

In San Diego. Another Christmas,. In Old Borego. Face-down in a little white shack in the back room. This town is a 35 Ford in a bad mood, in a bad mood. I hear you when I’m asleep,. Missy you’re the love I keep. But I still got no cash to send,. In my pocket. It’s been months since we first kissed,. But your face is what I miss,. And I keep your picture bent in my pocket"
awakening,"Face down with the LA curbside ending. In ones and zeros.. Downtown was the perfect place to hide.. The first star that I saw last night was a headlight. of a man-made sky, but. Man-made never made our dreams collide.. (chorus). Here we are now with the falling sky and the rain,. We're awakening. Here we are now with the desperate youth and the pain,. We're awakening. Maybe it's called ambition, you've been talking in your sleep. About a dream, We're awakening. Last week found me living for nothing but deadlines,. With my dead beat sky but, this town doesn't look the same tonight. These dreams started singing to me out of nowhere. And in all my life I don't know if I've ever felt so alive, alive. (chorus). I want to wake up kicking and screaming. I want to wake up kicking and screaming. I want a heart that I know is beating,. It's beating, I'm bleeding.. I want to wake up kicking and screaming. I want to live like I know what I'm leaving. I want a heart that I know is beating,. It's beating, I'm bleeding"
ba55,"I want a fire that could burn me clean. Light the sky with my black eyed dreams. And let my soul fly. And let my soul fly. I want a fire burn down the door. Let the wounds of my embers soar. And let my soul fly. And let my soul fly. Let it go. Pavement beneath my feet. I watch the white lines fly. Nothing between us here, but the black blue sky. Suspended up in the air, like a still life. Suspended up in the air, like a still life. Let it go. I believe you're the fire that could burn me clean"
back to the beginning again,"I can feel it building up inside. The images that play inside my mind. The dreams that I've been dreaming all my life. The colors that live outside of the lines. But dreams aren't all I hide beneath this skin. The cord is cut, the fears and doubts begin. My hope is anchored on the other side. With the colors that live outside of the lines. And the oceans roar. And the wheel's in spin. And the old chorus soars. Bring me back. bring me back to the beginning again. With the corrugated LA harbor stacks. With the weight of these machines across my back. I know a mountain road where time unwinds. But I'm busy living in a single-file line. And it all just sounds like poison on my ears. The background noise makes your voice so hard to hear. So I grit my teeth and straighten up my spine. I'm stuck in traffic on a dotted yellow line. And my heart is yours. And what a broken place it's in. But you're what I'm running for. And I want to feel the wind at my back again. Back to the beginning again. Back to the beginning again. I want to feel the wind at my back again. Back to the beginning again. Back to the beginning again. I want to feel the wind at my back again. And my heart is yours. And what a broken place it's in. But you're what I'm running for. And I want to feel the wind at my back again. Back to the beginning again. Back to the beginning again. I want to feel the wind at my back again.

begins,"To an aged man God spoke. Words that sounded like a joke. Soon his wife would bear a child. A saying hard to reconcile. So he asked, can this thing be. Can a nation spring from me.

Your life begins with God. Your love begins with God. Your hopes and your dreams. And your plans begin with God. From a valley full of bones. To a man of God, well known. Came a vision strange but true. Mighty things the Lord would do. He would breathe them back to life. His command caused them to rise. Like the nation He would raise. To the glory of His praise. (Chorus). I was standing on the edge of the world. Hopelessly alone in the dark. In the beginning all was empty and void. In my mind, my soul, my heart of hearts. The Creator came and moved in my life. He spoke and turned my darkness to light. Day by day He's rearranging my ways. He's my Lord, my God, my King. To a leper on his face. To a woman's dark disgrace. To a prisoner's empty night. To a blind man's quest for sight. To a mother's boy lying dead. To a beggar's plea for bread. To a lame man's crippled bones. To a stranger's journey home. (Chorus)"

Of pretty things.. You could have it all. Everything at once.. Everything you've seen,. Everything you'll need,. Everything you've ever had in fantasies."". ""You've one life,. You've one life.. You've one life left to lead."". I woke up from my dream. As a golden man. With a girl I've never seen. With golden skin. I jumped up to my feet. She asked me what was wrong. I began to scream. I don't think this is me. Is this just a dream. Or really happening?. What direction?. What direction?. I'm splitting up!. I'm splitting up!. This is my personal disaffection. What direction? What direction?. What direction now?. I looked outside the glass. At golden shores. Golden ships and masts. With golden cords. As my reflection passed. I hated what I saw. My golden eyes were dead. And a thought passed through my head. A heart that is made of gold can't really beat at all. I wanted to wake up again. Without a touch of gold. What direction?. Death or action!. Life begins at the intersection.. I woke up as before. But the gold was gone. My wife was at the door. With her night robe on. My heart beat once or twice. And life flooded my veins. Everything had changed. My lungs had found their voice. And what was once routine. And what was once routine was now the perfect joy. You've one life. You've one life. One life left to lead"

gone,"She told him she'd rather fix her makeup. than try and fix what's going on. But the problem keeps on calling. even with the cell phone gone.. She told him that she believes in living. bigger than she's living now. But her world keeps spinning backwards. And upside down.. Don't say so long, and throw yourself wrong.. Don't spin today away, 'cause today will soon be. Gone, like yesterday is gone. Like history is gone. Just try and prove me wrong and. pretend like you're immortal.. She said, he said, live like no tomorrow. Everyday we borrow brings us. one step closer to the edge. Infinity.. Where's your treasure, where's your hope. if you get the world and lose your soul?. She pretends like she pretends like she's immortal.. Don't say so long, you're not that far gone.. This could be your big chance to make-up. Today will soon be. Gone, like yesterday is gone. Like history is gone. The world keeps spinning on. You're going, going. Gone, like summer break is gone,. Like Saturday is gone. Just try and prove me wrong and. pretend like you're immortal (you're immortal). You're immortal (you're immortal). Ha-ah. We are not infinite. We are not permanent. Nothing is immediate. We are so confident in our accomplishments.. Look at our decadence.. Gone, like Frank Sinatra, like Elvis and his mom,. Like Al Pacino's cash, nothing lasts in this life.. My High School dreams are gone,. my childhood sweets are gone. Life is a day that doesn't last for long.. Life is more than money, time was never money.. Time was never cash, life is still more than girls.. Life is more than hundred dollar bills and roto-tom fills.. Life is more than fame and rock and roll and thrills,. All the riches of the kings end up in wills. We've got information in the information age. but do we know what life is outside of our convenient Lexus cages?. She said he said live like no tomorrow. Every moment that we borrow brings us closer. to a God who's not short of cash. Hey Bono, I'm glad you asked.. Life is still worth living, Life is still worth living.. Life is more that we are."
good night punk,"Everything I ever need to know. I learned at the punk rock show. The punks should know. How to throw an elbow or a fist. A spitting world of hit and miss. A violent kiss of that and this. But hold on, hold on. I'll never be quite punk enough. Hold on, hold on. I'll never be quite punk enough for you. Ever since I first learned how to spit. I wished I were a punk rock kid, a punk rock kid. I never really knew quite what to do. I'll never be as punk as you. As punk as you, as punk as you. And your tattoo. But hold on, hold on. Punk is more than leather jackets. Hold on, hold on. Punk is dead but pop was never cool. What are we gonna do?"

I'm here without you baby. But you're still with me in my dreams. And tonight, there's only you and me.. The miles just keep rollin'. As the people leave their way to say hello.

Hold the old me down. (Give me the waters that could help me heal). Hold the old me down. (Let the rain come down). On the thirsty ground. Let the rains come down. I want to drink the clouds. Like holy water. I felt like this when I was a boy. A firefly in Illinois. A pair of wings and an electric heart. Broken wings and a shot in the dark. With that fire in our eyes. (Lighting up the summertime sky). With that fire in our eyes. (I felt so alive). But now I'm praying for rain. I want to make that change. I got your blood in my veins. Like holy water. Sisters, sons, and daughters. Hold me down with the holy water. Blisters, guns, and fathers. Hold me down with the. Sisters, sons, and daughters. Hold me down with the holy water. Like holy water. My head is aching like a riot. 40 days in the desert pain. When I hear the lies I don't buy it. Still looking for the desert rain and I. Fight the fire with the fire. I want to taste your love again and I. Let the flood rise higher. Wash the doubt away. Like holy water"
home,"It's a long way from Miami to LA. It's a longer way from yesterday. To where I am today. It's a long way from my thoughts. To what I'll say. It's a long, long way from paradise. To where I am today. All that's in my head. Is in Your hands. It's a long way from. The moon up to the sun. It's a longer ahead of me. The road that I've begun. Stop to think of all the. Time I've lost. Start to think of all the. Bridges that I've burned. That must be crossed. Over, over, over. Take me over. I've been poison. I've been rain. I've been fooled again. I've seen ashes. Shine like chrome. Someday I'll see home. Home, home. I can see the stars. From way down here. But I can't fall asleep. Behind the wheel. It's a long way from the. Shadows in my cave. Up to Your reality to. Watch the sunlight taking over."
hope is the anthem,"Sometimes what you need is what you fight. Like a wounded man out on the run. Like shadows hiding from the light. But your love is what I was running from. Hope's a seed you have to sow. When you let it go it comes to life. So you stretch your arrows on the bow. And you pull them back and watch them fly. My heartbeat, my oxygen. My banner, my home. My future, my song. Your hope is the anthem of my soul. My lungs and I were born to fight. Sometimes I'm not sure what I'm fighting for. But death ain't the only end in sight. Cause this ain't a battle it's a lifelong war. My heartbeat, my oxygen. My banner, my home. My freedom, my song. Your hope is the anthem of my soul. Your hope is the anthem of my soul. My heart is beating like a blown speaker. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weaker. A distortion pedal and a pair of wings. And an anthem played on broken strings. My heartbeat, my oxygen. My banner, my home. My future, my song. Your hope is the anthem of my soul. Your hope is the anthem of my soul. Yeah could you make me whole?. (Like holy water)"
i turn everything over,"Monday found me on my knees again. Breathing You in. To blur the lines that mark where I begin. And where You end. No use in trying to pretend. Come take me again. 'Cause rumor has it I'm not who I've been. Come define me. What can we do. If the rumors are true?. I turn everything over. I turn myself in. I turn everything over. I turn myself in. There's nothing left for me to defend. I turn everything over. I turn myself in, yeah. The evidence convicts the hollow men. After looking inside. To my dismay I find I'm just one of them. 'Cause I'm an already but not yet. resurrected fallen man. Come break this limbo. And I know You know just who I've been. Come define me. Rumor has it You love me. Rumor has it the world spins upside down. Rumor has my only hope is You. And the rumors are true. I turn everything over."
i won't let you go,"When it feels like surgery. And it burns like third degree. And you wonder what is it worth?. When your insides breaking in. And you feel that ache again. And you wonder. What's giving birth?. If you could let the pain of the past go. Of your soul. None of this is in your control. If you could only let your guard down. You could learn to trust me somehow. I swear, that I won't let you go. If you could only let go your doubts. If you could just believe in me now. I swear, that I won't let you go. I won't let you go. When your fear is currency. And you feel that urgency. You want peace but there's war in your head. Maybe that's where life is born. When our façades are torn. Pain gives birth to the promise ahead. If you could let the pain of the past go. Of your soul. None of this is in your control. If you could only let your guard down. If you could learn to trust me somehow. I swear, that I won't let you go. If you could only let go your doubts. If you could just believe in me now. I swear, that I won't let you go. I won't let you go. I'll always be by your side.

if the house burns down tonight,"Ashes from the flames. The truth is what remains. The truth is what you save. From the fire. And you fight for what you love. Don't matter if it hurts. You find out what it's worth. And you let the rest burn. The sunset burns like gasoline. Touch me and make sure that I'm not dreaming. I see her face and my heart skips beats. But I still get the feeling that we're half asleep and. There's a spark in the corner of my baby's eye. Like a distant star that won't burn quiet. And I might not know what I want from this life. But I know I want more than the starting line. So give me the fire. I can hear the motor running down the interstate. And all the distractions fade away. And if the house burns down tonight. I got everything I need with you by my side. I see the smoke piling up in the rear view mirror. Yeah but I ain't ever seen it any clearer. If the house burns down tonight. I got everything I need when I got you by my side. And let the rest burn. And let the rest burn. And let the rest burn. I've given too much of my heart away. My soul's holding on like a house divided. Like a match it burns down like a masquerade. And I had to let it go when the fire ignited. One heart, two hands, your life is all you hold. To hold, hold tight and let the bitter go. Yeah let it go, and give me the fire. The smoke tries choking the pacific sun. We rocket down the road like we're shot out of guns. And if the house burns down tonight. I got everything I need with you by my side. Holding you and the wheel and it occurs to me. We're driving down the edge of eternity. If the house burns down tonight. I got everything I need when I got you by my side. And let the rest burn. And let the rest burn. Put your hand in mine and. Put your heart in driving. We got everything we need yeah. We got everything we need yeah. Left it all behind us. What we need will find us. We got everything we need yeah. We got everything we need yeah. Can you hear that motor running. Can you hear that motor running. There ain't no stopping us now. There ain't no slowing us down. Can you hear that motor running. Can you hear that motor run, run, run. And all those lies that mattered most to me. Were draining me dry making a ghost of me. And if the house burns down tonight. I got everything I need, everything I need. There's a fire coming that we all will go through. You possess your possessions or they possess you. And if the house burns down tonight. I got everything I need when I got you by my side. And let the rest burn. Ashes from the flames. The truth is what remains"
incomplete,"He's washing his face to start his day. He's lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely. Nothing in the mirror ever shows him what's within. Now he's checking out the faces. On the back of the milk. He's sour under all this pressure. He thinks the missing person looks an awful lot like him. And he starts his engine. But he knows that he's missing gears. Chorus: Incomplete. Where will you find yourself?. Incomplete. Where will you find yourself?. (2nd: Where will you lose yourself?). 'Cause you're the missing person now. Step outside your doubt. And let yourself be found. He's sick of the race just to save face. He's tied and tried, he's sick and tired. Tired of the holes that are making him incomplete. He'll push the pedal to the floor. Like the day before. He's trying to be always trying. Try to find an end to justify his means. (Chorus)."
innocence again,"Do you remember when. You were way back then. You held the world inside your hands. When you told me love. Was the strongest stuff. Your strenght was innocence. But, oh man. The signs of the times are omens. You're starting the day in. No man's land again. Who are you gonna be?. When your on your knees, who do you believe?. Fear is a lonely man. You've been given innocence. You've been given innocence again. You should know by now. That the darkest hour. Is when your broken heart goes down. It's a bitter end. When the sweet begins. Grace is sufficiency. But oh dear, we'll never deserve it. No dear, we never could earn it. Now, here the choice is yours. Grace is high and low. We'll never be the same."
joy invincible,"Everything fell to pieces. When my eyes met yours. In that hospital gown. And the dreams we once were dreaming. That we held so close. Felt impossible now. And all the plans we held for the future. And all the memories up from the past. The world I once knew. Was in a cardboard box. In the lobby lost and found. Hallelujah nevertheless, was the song the pain couldn't destroy. Hallelujah nevertheless, You're my joy invincible. Joy invincible, joy. Tears were in my eyes when the phone rings. If only life didn't need us to be this brave. But we don't live in the world of if only's. Stretched tight in between our birth and our graves. Hallelujah nevertheless. Open your eyes. Look to the skies. We are the children of the promise. Hold to what's real. Everything heals. We are the children of the promise. Open your heart. Look for the sparks. We are the children of the promise. Love is your place. Feel the light on your face. We are the children of the promise. Hallelujah nevertheless, was the song the pain couldn't destroy. Hallelujah nevertheless, You're my joy invincible. Joy invincible, joy. Tears were in my eyes when the phone rings. If only life didn't need us to be this brave. But we don't live in the world of if only's. Stretched tight in between our birth and our graves. Hallelujah nevertheless. Tears were in my eyes when the phone rings. Maybe it's Your joy that's giving me strength. You're my joy invincible. Joy invincible, joy"

To find a way to use our lungs for love and not the shadows"

When I lose direction. I pray to be found."

You're stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. You can close your ears and your eyes but. Pop will never leave you alone. Leave me alone with your social mingle. You try so hard to stay on top. Leave me alone with your little jingle. With your picture perfect pop. We read the article in Seventeen. We saw your video on MTV. This is a tune for the late Nirvana. The teen spirit rock and roll. This is a tune for the velvet Elvis's. On the 90210. I thought my eyes were gonna get off clean. Till I read your lips on the TV screen.

Won't You bring me home?. Tried to start on something new. Tried to blame myself on You. But my nightmares all came true. I felt so unsteady. I still see Your face when I close my eyes and. I think about You wide awake at night and. How far do I have to go to realize. What I know already. I am Yours and Yours alone. Forgive me for my wandering on my own. I'm a prodigal soul. I was running on empty. I was feeling so low. When You made me a promise. To never let me go. I was falling to pieces. When You carried me home. When You told me you loved me. And my prodigal soul. In my dreams, all is forgiven. In my dreams, I'm by Your side. But when I wake up somethings missing. Can You free me from my prodigal soul?. Won't You bring me home?"

Yeah, for once in a rare blue moon. I see everything clear. I'll be a beautiful letdown. That's what I'll forever be. And though it may cost my soul. I'll sing for free. We're still chasing our tails. In the rising sun. In our dark water planet still spinning. In a direction no one wins. No one's won.. See, I don't belong here (I don't belong). Well, I don't belong here, I don't belong. I will carry a cross. With a song where I don't belong. I don't belong. I don't belong here (I don't belong). No, I don't belong here, I don't belong. I'm gonna set side. And set sail. For the kingdom come, kingdom come. Your kingdom come. Won't you let me down, yeah. Let my foolish pride forever let me down. Ah, Easy living, you're not much like the name. Easy dying, you look just about the same. Would you please take me off your list. Easy living please c'mon and let me down. We are a beautiful letdown. Painfully uncool. The church of the dropouts. The losers, the sinners, the failures, and the fools. What a beautiful letdown. Are we salt in the wound. Hey, let us sing one true tune. I don't belong here (I don't belong). It feels like I don't belong here, yeah. It goes like I don't belong here. I don't belong (I don't belong). Won't you let me down (I don't belong). C'mon and let me down (I don't belong). You always let me down (I don't belong). So glad that I'm let down (I don't belong). C'mon and let me down (I don't belong). â€™Cause I don't belong here. Won't you let me down!. ."
the blues,is this the new year. or just another night. is this the new fear. or just another fright. is this the new tear. or just another desperation. is this the finger. or just another fist. is this the kingdom. or just a hit and miss. a misdirection most in all this desperation. is this what they call freedom. is this what you call pain. is this what they call discontented fame. it'll be a day like this one. when the world caves in. when the world caves in. when the world caves in.

the day i found god,"The morning comes like an enemy soldier. I feel the weight across my shoulders. I feel the shadows getting colder. But that ain't you. This noose ain't getting any looser. I get so fearful about the future. I hear the shame of my accuser. But that ain't you. I found strength but it wasn't what I thought. I found peace in the places I forgot. I found riches ain't the things that I had bought. I found out. The day I lost myself was the day that I found God. I get caught chasing my own illusions. I get so lost in these confusions. I keep on looking for my own solutions. But that ain't you, that ain't you no. My enemies weren't the ones I had fought. My liberties weren't the freedoms I had sought. What I learned weren't the lessons I'd been taught. I found out the day I lost myself was. The day that I found God. Where is God out in the darkness?. Cause the voices in my head ain't talking honest. They're saying maybe you made us then forgot us. But that ain't you, that ain't you no. And all I know is that I still don't know a lot. I don't know how it ends I'm in the middle of this plot. Yeah and I found grace for the man that I am not. Yeah, I found out the day I lost myself. Yeah, I found out. The day I lost myself. Was the day that I found God"
the economy of mercy,"There's just two ways to lose yourself in this life. And neither way is safe. In my dreams I see visions of the future. But today we have today. And where will I find You?. Where will I find You?. In the economy of mercy. I am a poor and begging man. In the currency of grace. Is where my song begins. In the colors of Your goodness. In the scars that mark Your skin. In the currency of grace. Is where my song begins. These carbon shells. These fragile dusty frames. House canvases of souls. We are bruised and broken masterpieces. But we did not paint ourselves. And where will I find You?. Where was I when the world was made?. Where was I?. I'm lost without You here. Yes, I'm lost without You near. I'm lost without You here. You knew my name when the world was made"
the edge of the earth,When the morning finds us. We open up our eyes. With the stars still fading in the sky. All along the journey. You leave the past behind. I had a dream that we could fly. Over distant oceans. The fallen mountains. The great wide open. Of the desert sky. And where I'll be is. Where you find me. Meet me here at the edge of the earth. Meet me here at the edge of the earth. So come on. Come on. So I set off running. To reach the other side. To find a place to call my home. There in the distance. The rivers open wide. And I was lost but not alone. Over distant oceans. The fallen mountains. The great wide open. Of the desert sky. And where I'll be is. Where you find me. Meet me here at the edge of the earth. Meet me here at the edge of the earth. So come on. So come on
the fatal wound,I am the crisis. I am the bitter end. I'm gonna gun this town. I am divided. I am the razor edge. there is no easy now. son of sorrow. staring down forever. with an aching view. disenchanted. lets go down together. with the fatal wound. this is the real thing. no rubber bullets now. this is the final bow. my breath avoids me. my chest is in my head. my stomach's upside down. down. son of sorrow. staring down forever. with an aching view. disenchanted. lets go down together. with the fatal wound. with the fatal wound. with the fatal wound
the hardest art,You're still there in the back of my mind. In that sunset together. Looking back I see the warning signscalling us now or never. Every movie makes love seem easy. They fall in love like the fire burns. And maybe I'm the only one. But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn. Stepping into the neon sky. Compass set on forever. We swim for shore in the bright red tide. With notes that time couldn't sever. Every movie makes love seem easy. They fall in love like the fire burns. And maybe I'm the only one. But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn. Love is. Surrender is. Love is. Surrender is. Love is the hardest art. The hardest art to learn. Love is. Surrender is. Love is. Surrender is. Love is the hardest art. Every movie makes love seem easy. They fall in love like the fire burns. And maybe I'm the only one. But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn. But it feels like love is the hardest art. Is the hardest art to learn. The hardest art. Love is. Surrender is. Love is. Surrender is. Love is the hardest art. The hardest art. Love is. Surrender is. Love is. Surrender is. Love is the hardest art
the hardest art (ft. kaela sinclair) lyrics,You're still there in the back of my mind. In that sunset together. Looking back I see the warning signs. Calling us now or never. Every movie makes love seem easy. They fall in love like the fire burns. And maybe I'm the only one. But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn. Stepping into the neon sky. Compass set on forever. We swim for shore in the bright red tide. With notes that time couldn't sever. Every movie makes love seem easy. They fall in love like the fire burns. And maybe I'm the only one. But it feels like love is the hardest art to learn. Love is. Surrender is. Love is. Surrender is. Love is the hardest art. The hardest art to learn
the loser,"Only the losers win. They've got nothing to prove. They'll leave the world with nothing to lose. You can laugh at the weirdos now. Wait till wrongs are right. They'll be the ones with nothing to hide. 'Cause I've been thinking, thinking. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've got a contract pending on eternity. If I haven't already given it away. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've been the burnout kid. I've been the idiot. I'll turn the other cheek to be hit. You can take what you want from me. Empty me till I'm depleted. I'll be around if I'm ever needed. I've been thinking, thinking. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've got a contract pending on eternity. If I haven't already given it away. I've got a plan to lose it all. I wrote this song for you. To show how I'm selling out. I'll take the benefit of the doubt. ."

Don't let nobody try and take your soul. You're the original
the setting sun,I've got a wound that doesn't heal. Burning out again. Burning out again. I'm not sure which of me is real. I'm alone again. Burning out again. My hope runs underneath it all. The day that I'll be home. It won't be long. I belong. Somewhere past this setting sun. Finally free. Finally strong. Somewhere back where I belong. They're selling shares of me again. But I'm not buying it. I'm not buying it. My wound goes deeper then the skin. There's no hiding it. So I'm not trying it. My hope runs underneath it all. The day that I'll be home. It won't be long. I belong. Somewhere past this setting sun. Finally free. Finally strong. Somewhere back where I belong. Let the weak say I am strong. And it won't be long. Let the right say I was wrong. And it won't be long. Let us find where we belong. Beyond this setting sun. Beyond this setting sun. It won't be long. I belong. Somewhere past this setting sun. Finally free. Finally strong. Somewhere back where I belong
the shadow proves the sunshine,"Sunshine, won't you be my mother. Sunshine, come and help me sing. My heart is darker than these oceans. My heart is frozen underneath.

the sound (john m. perkins' blues),"The static comes in slow. You can feel it grow. Our stream of conscience flows. Under the streets below. Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh. Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh. The rivers made a sound. Still running underground. Runs like a silent flood. We run as thick as blood. Can you hear it rise?. Up from the ground. Can't drown it out. Can you hear it now?. - Chorus -. This is the sound of a heartbeat!. This is the sound from the discontented mouths. Of a haunted nation. We are the voice of breaking down!. Can you hear me? This is the sound!. Of a desperation bound by a heart collision. We are the voice of breaking down!. The static comes alive. Beneath the broken skies. John Perkins said it right. ""Love is the final fight"". Ohhhhh, Ohhhhhh. Ohhhhh, Ohhhhhh. Let it rise above! Rise above!. There is no sound. Louder than love. - Chorus -. This is the sound of a heartbeat!. This is the sound from the discontented mouths. Of a haunted nation. We are the voice of breaking down!. Can you hear me? This is the sound!. Of a desperation bound by a heart collision. We are the voice of breaking down!. Down, down, down. Let it rise above. Up from the ground. You can't drown it out. Can you hear it now?. - Chorus -. This is the sound of a heartbeat!. This is the sound from the discontented mouths. Of a haunted nation. We are the voice of breaking down!. Can you hear me? This is the sound!. Of a desperation bound by our fallen condition. We are the voice of breaking down!.

I get so sick of this. It gets rediculous. And my mouth is an Army. The Sound in my mouth. It gets so loud [2x]. Little words can slip out. words like sorry. and I'm so sorry. YEAH!!!. I am the tyrant of this course. I am the beater of the dead horse. I am the irritant [2x]. and my mouth is a brute force. Here we are in another night. Gearin' up or a social accident.

the strength to let go,"I don't like to admit. When I'm wrong and need gifts. Of forgiveness instead of applause. I was dying to prove to myself. I could make it alone. It took years to confess. That your love was the best. At unraveling all of my pride. Had to laugh at myself. When I realized that you were my home. Give me the strength to let go. Give me the strength to surrender. Give me the strength to stop holding on. I've been holding on so long. Give me the strength to let go. And show me the way to come home. Yeah I'm stubborn and bold. But sometimes it gets old. Fighting voices inside of my brain. I was trying to pretend I was fine. When inside it was war. With the stumbling beat. Of my heart and my feet. And the faults of my failure and pain. To think all of this time. I had wings that were ready to soar. Give me the strength to let go. Oh love, light the way home. Light up my soul. I choose mercy instead of control. My life is on loan. Forgive and let go. I embrace a belief I don't know. What a beautiful sound. To lay your life down. Your forgiveness is where I am found. Here in your arms. I finally let down. I am lightning and you are the ground. Give me the strength to let go. I am lightning and you are the ground"
the war inside,"Put your hands up open up wide. Put your hands up side by side. Age don't matter like. Race don't matter like. Place don't matter like what's inside. Let the kick drum kick one time.

Between these hopes and where we've been. Every fight comes from the fight within. - chorus -. I am the war inside. I am the battle line. I am the rising tide. I am the war i fight. Eyes open open wide. I can feel it like a crack in my spine. I can feel it like the back of my mind. I am the war inside. I get the feeling that we're living in sci-fi. I get the the feeling that our weapons are lo-fi. Ain't no killer like pride. No killer like i. No killer like what's inside. Yeah, it's in the air we breathe. Yeah, it's in the blood we bleed. Beneath these dreams and what we've seen. We are the kids of the in-between. Put your hands up open up wide. Put your hands up side by side. Age don't matter like. Race don't matter like.

the world you want,"I'm picking up the pieces. I'm trying out adhesives. I'm trying to fix a place that feels broken. All my words they fail me. My voices don't avail me.

under the floor,Under the floor. Between me and the door. There's a presence I cannot deny. It's under the car. Between me and the stars. I see glory filling up the sky. And I'm certain that He hears me. He listens even as I sing my song. I'm emphatic that He's near me. And I can see His touch in everything here. Deep is the soul. Is the space I control. Is the one thing I can call as mine. Deeper the cold. When He's far from soul. I surrender all of me inside. .

vice verses,"Walking along the high tide line. Watching the pacific from the sidelines. Wonder what it means to live together?. Looking for more than just guidelines. Looking for signs in the night sky,. Wishing that I wasn't such a nice guy. Wonder what it means to live forever?. Wonder what it means to die?. I know that there's a meaning to it all. A little resurrection every time I fall. You got your babies, I got my hearses. Every blessing comes with a set of curses. I got my vices, I got my vice verses. I got my vice verses. The wind could be my new obsession. The wind could be my new depression. The wind goes anywhere it wants to. Wishing that I learned my lesson. The ocean sounds like a garage band.

You got your babies, I got my hearses. Every blessing comes with a set of curses. I got my vices, I got my vice verses. I got my vice verses. Let the pacific laugh. Be on my epitaph. With it's rising and falling. And after all, it's just water. And I am just soul. With a body of water and bones. Water and bones. Where is God in the night sky?. Where is God in the city light?. Where is God in the earthquake?. Where is God in the genocide?. Where are you in my broken heart?. Everything seems to fall apart. Everything feels rusted over. Tell me that you're there.

voices,My words come out like an avalanche in silence. And you've got oceans strapped to your eyelids. They tell me that no man is an island. But it feels like it's a storm that I've been fighting. And I used to listen to the radio. But I've got an army of voices in my head. Voices in my head. And we used to live in stereo. But I've got an army of voices in my head. Voices in my head. How come the friends and the foes invisible. Are the ones that made my soul most miserable?. Head's reeling from the feeling. In my mind but I feel it in the physical. Why's the sunlight hiding?. Ain't letting any light in. It's the storm that I've been fighting. And I used to listen to the radio. But I've got an army of voices in my head. Voices in my head. And we used to live in stereo. But I've got an army of voices in my head. Voices in my head

Darlin please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg. For your time and your attention and the thoughts inside your head. Oh please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg. The meeting of our minds, the touching of our skin. We both have different ways, to let each other in. - Chorus –. We want the same things, to be loved. We need the same things, to have enough. We want the same things, someone to trust. We need the same things, please don’t make me beg. There’s a man down on the corner, guitar case at his feet. Oh please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg. And he’s singing out with gladness, and he’s doing it for for free. Oh please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg. Such a simple choice, to share the things we have. He’s got an angel voice, it’s money that he lacks. Said the son to the father, must I drink from this cup. Please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg. And let my death be the redemption, for every single one. Oh please don’t make me beg, please don’t make me beg. That man changed everything when he was lifted up. Can’t you hear him say just don’t run from love. Don’t make me beg"
we're gonna be alright,"It's ok to fear. It's ok when you feel small. You're ok right here. It's ok when you feel nothing at all. It's ok to find out. What you though you had ain't what you got. It's ok to doubt. To learn what you think ain't what you thought. We are always in motion. Like the winds, the tides, the ocean. Everyday I'm born again. I wake up I feel that second wind. We're gonna be alright. I've seen the look in your eye. We're gonna be alright. Just take a look at the sky. We're gonna be alright. It's ok to grieve. It's ok to learn to fall. It's ok to believe. To admit that you're human after all. It's ok to heal. All of those scars buried deep inside. It's ok to feel. To say all the things you've been trying to hide. Lift it up to the ceiling. Cause we all need that healing. Let's get lost in the feeling, the feeling. The feeling. We're gonna be alright"
what it costs,"Sun light fading fast, make it last. Like a flame flickers, then it's past. Moonlight fades to dark, carry on. You never know what's real until it's gone. But love deals the currency of loss. Don't ever forget what it costs. Hold on to me, carry me through. Our story needs the pain that we outgrew. Yeah you can't call it love until you've lost. If you love someone this is what it costs. This city cries softly tonight. Like a million teardrops from a thousand eyes. I'm drenched beneath the rainy Melbourne skies. Wonder how it is I feel so dry inside. But love uses the pain to drill the holes. That irrigate our dry and thirsty souls. Hold on to me, carry me through. Our story, is the pain that we outgrew. Yeah you can't call it love until you've loss. If you love someone this is what it costs. Sun light fading fast make it last. Sun light fading fast make it last"
when we come alive,"Ohh! Ohh!. Ohh! Ohh!. The sun goes down like a photograph. You try to stop time in the aftermath. But it's gone, gone. Yesterday reads like a tragedy. I try not to lose what's left of me. But it's gone. Yeah, but we carry on. We are fire. Burning brightly. You and I. We light the sky. When we ignite. When we come alive. When we come alive. It feels like I could get lost today. The winds in my mind get swept away. And I'm gone, gone. And it's one last time to the wishing well. I throw down the change and I wish them well. But they're gone. Yeah, but we'll carry on. We are our souls on fire. We are reaching higher. We are our souls on fire. When we come alive. When we come alive. We are fire. You and I. Strength, heart, soul, mind"
when you say nothing at all,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.. Without saying a word you can light up the dark..

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me theres a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me the truth of your hand will say that youll never catch me where ever I fall, you say it best, when you say nothing at all.. All day long I can hear people talking out loud.. But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd, try as I may they can never define whats been said between your heart and mine.

where i belong,"Feeling like a refugee. Like it don't belong to me. The colors flash across the sky. This air feels strange to me. Feeling like a tragedy. I take a deep breath and close my eyes. One last time. One last time. Storms on the wasteland. Dark clouds on the plains again. We were born into the fight. But I'm not sentimental. This skin and bones is a rental. And no one makes it out alive. Until I die I'll sing these songs. On the shores of Babylon. Still looking for a home. In a world where I belong. Where the weak are finally strong. Where the righteous right the wrongs. Still looking for a home. In a world where I belong. Feels like we're just waiting, waiting. While our hearts are just breaking, breaking. Feels like we've been fighting against the tide. I wanna see the earth shaking. I wanna see a generation. Finally waking up inside. Until I die I'll sing these songs. On the shores of Babylon. Still looking for a home. In a world where I belong. Where the weak are finally strong. Where the righteous right the wrongs. Still looking for a home. In a world where I belong. In a world where I belong. This body's not my own. This world is not my own. But I can still hear the sound. Of my heart beating out. So let's go boys, play it loud. On the final day I die. I want to hold my head up high. I want to tell You that I tried. To live it like a song. And when I reach the other side. I want to look You in the eye. And know that I've arrived. In a world where I belong. Where I belong. Where I belong. Where I belong. I still believe we can live forever. You and I we begin forever now. Forever now. Forever. I still believe in us together. You and I we're here together now. Together now. Forever now. Forever now. Forever now. Forever. Forever"

wonderful feeling,"Sunlight. Ain't it good to feel alright. Ain't it good to know that you're not alone. Yeah ain't it good to know. Cause I lived my whole life. Looking for the light with closed eyes. Ain't it funny how you fight what you need the most. Yeah, but I can finally feel my soul tonight. I've got this wonderful feeling. I've got my hopes set high. And after all this time spent chasing my shadow. Let Your light be mine. Let Your light be mine. Come on sunlight prove the darkness wrong. Ain't it funny how the fears we had last night. Don't look so scary in the morning light. Come on flowers open up your arms. Ain't it good to finally step into that light. Yeah and I can feel it in my soul tonight. Like a waterfall. Washing over my shadows. Like a waterfall. I'm under now. Let your waterfall and. Let your all of Your love pour down"
yesterdays,"The flowers cut and brought inside. Black cars in a single line. Your family in suits and ties. And you're free. The ache I feel inside. Is where the life has left your eyes.

And until I'm with you, I carry on. Adrift on your ocean floor. I feel weightless numb and sore. A part of you and me is torn. You're free. I woke from a dream last night. I dreamt that you were by my side. Reminding me I still had life. In me. I remember you like yesterday. Yesterday. I still can't believe you're gone. Oh I remember you like yesterday. Yesterday. And until I'm with you, I carry on. I'll carry on, I'll carry on. Every lament is a love song. Yesterday, yesterday. I still can't believe you're gone. Every lament is a love song. Yesterday, yesterday"
yet,"All attempts have failed. All my heads are tails. She's got teary eyes. I've got reasons why. I'm losing ground and gaining speed. I've lost myself or most of me.

I've been a fool for long enough. To fight it, to fight it. It's in Your arms I find my place. You meet me where I am. Forgive me where I am. Where I lose myself in grace. (When I'm lost and found).

you're my angel,Looking into to your eyes I see all I want to be. And i don't want it to end. If i could only put two words in the way I see you. I only know i have an angel with me now.

I've been keeping my eyes wide open. Your love is a symphony. All around me. Running through me. Your love is a melody. Underneath me. Running to me. Your love is a song. The dawn is fire bright. Against the city lights. The clouds are clowing now. The moon is blacking now,is blacking out. I've been keeping my mind wide open. I've been keeping my mind wide open. Your love is a song. With my eyes wide open. I've got my eyes wide open. I've been keeping my hopes unbroken"
