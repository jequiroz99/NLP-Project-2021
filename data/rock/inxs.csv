Street to street. We pass each other on the stairs. Listened to by the walls. We share the same spaces. Repeated in the corridors. Performing the same movements. Storey to storey. Building to building. Street to street.

face the change,Turns back to front. Turns hate to love. The simple things that mean a lot. Turns rock to sand. Turns ice to snow. That's you and me about to grow. Change the face of a magazine. Face the change of a million years. Stare in shock at what you saw. Take a breath and lock the door. Tell your children what to do. Mistakes and all they still love you. Change the face of a magazine. Face the change of a million years. Turns rough to smooth. Turns don't to do. To reminisce turns me to you. Turns war to peace. Turns greed to need.
fair weather ahead,"There's this place full of mountain heads. Living and chewing on the fat. Built upon that hazy rain. Like foundations slipping through the sand. Long teeth and whiskers like a cat. Fearing only those present. They got zero emotion. And everybody's fed up with that. Warm outside but very cold within. Followed and praised for many years. They got all the promotions. Isn't that the way it's always been. History's written always red. Its pages are painfull and clear. It's so full of devotion. Makes you wonder where it could have led. Put the lights out, fair weather ahead. These strange new creatures."

It's all in the choices. That you have to make. I got to tell you. You better make them good. I got to tell you. All you got to have faith. In each other. All you ever. All you ever have for each other. All you got to have faith. In each other. All you ever. All you ever have for each other. All the people. In this world. All the people. In this whole wide world.

Stupid people I won't follow. Build a better country. Fight a war or two. You always need something. Just to get you through. Ten times I shouted at him. Say it over again again. Words just melt around you.

Full moon over dirty hearts. Full moon over dirty hearts. I took a voyage over deep blue sea. I took a voyage over deep blue sea. .

Street to street. We pass each other on the stairs. Listened to by the walls. We share the same spaces. Repeated in the corridors. Performing the same movements. Storey to storey. Building to building. Street to street.

god's top ten,"(feat. Suzie McNeil). Romance is gone, he's drifting with the stars. The lyric in his pocket, little girl in his heart. When you hear his songs on the radio I don't need to tell you what you already know. He's in God's top ten where heaven never ends. You saw the world and the world saw you on the stage. Wild, wild, wild, the lonlier boy. Your gypsy heart is free, pictures on the wall of your family. He's on God's top ten where heaven never ends. He's on God's top ten. Baby's got mama's eyes, she was always beautiful. When you hear his voice, feel his arms around you. You remember mama's smile and daddy's little girl. Bad weather, cold meteor storm.

night of rebellion,Simple matters always seem. To make things complicated. I think of ways to understand. But it all gets away from me. I sense persuasion of a kind. It wraps itself around me.

But you're too young for money. They'd rather paint the whole town red. Than spend it on what they're told. Summer to winter is never the same. If it is then it's time to change. I don't want to rock your sacred boat.

viking juice: the end of rock & roll,"If this was easy, where would I be?. I haven't said I have all the answers, how could anyone?. Can't stop looking at the lights all around my head. I'm missing the darker side of the man. He's on his knees looking for the door. But everybody's giving him applause. Crashed the car into a wall. But everybody's calling for more. It's called the end of rock and roll. These days are numbered counted out in loss. Faith and spirit walking hand in hand. To meet a wall made of sound. But where does that sound find a place today. Maybe we came to the wrong show, I've seen this before. It’s called the end of rock and roll. Oh shadow take me leave nothing still. 'cause I've not seen the miracle, how could anyone?. We ask too much of the song to come and save our souls. When all it's trying to do now is save its own. Maybe we came to the wrong show, I've seen this before. Maybe we came to the wrong show, I've seen this before. It’s called the end of rock and roll. It’s called the end of rock and roll"
waiting to be free,"There are times when I feel like nothingâ€™s been achieved. Torn by indecision, itâ€™s not hard to believe it. That all of our hopes and all of our dreams. Wrapped up in chains just waiting to be free. I got to tell you all about it. Man killing man and words are afar. So many dreams and Iâ€™m dark. Close all the windows and lock all the doors. Deceiving your friends and using us all. I got to tell you, doo, doo, doo, yeah. There are times when I feel like nothingâ€™s been achieved. Torn by indecision, itâ€™s not hard to believe it.

I love you like I do. I try to tell you, doo, doo, doo. Doo, doo, loo, loo. ."

what would you do,I've come a long way by car. The road went narrow. The bridges too far. Screaming at 90. Whisper at 10. Feel the towns make you spend. Another city phone rings. Letting tears come through. Mixed among feelings. Fed on your body. Fed on your mind. Words that always remind. Closed eyes and no more breathing. A trick I had played. To scare the living. She laughs at my game. Questions if I'm sane. And all we can do is grin. Look see the story. What would you do. All the facts before you.

who pays the price,Yes it's dark sometimes. When the people are shoving. Pushing you into the ground. And you cry in the daylight. With the sun in your eyes. Even though you know you're not alone. And it's all been felt before. You stare out through your window. And wonder if there's gonna be more. It brings you down. It's like a war. Who pays the price. If you want more. Quiet desperation of a million lives. Gonna make you change your ways. We got everything we wanted. But we forgot how we got it. Just can't paint it golden anyway. And the strength of all you're giving. Is gonna make the changes. Tomorrow's gonna bring a new day. It brings you down. It's like a war. Who pays the price. If you want more. As the years go by. Will it show on your face. Or stay hidden behind some door. Yeah you made your resolutions. With the will of a priest. But you're not so sure anymore. And the reasons why you're living. Keep changing. Everytime you find a key you find more. It brings you down. It's like a war. Who pays the price. If you want more. It brings you down. It's like a war. Who pays the price. If you want more. It brings you down. It's like a war. Who pays the price. If you want more. It brings you down. It's like a war. Who pays the price. If you want more. It brings you down.

We make decisions. Wild life. Wild life. When it's bad. It ain't bad enough. I got to learn. Some respect. That's what I have. I have for you. Motivation. It comes and goes. But the questions. They stay alive. Wild life. Wild life. When it's bad.

wishy washy,I got a place with a view. You can see the cars. As they travel down the freeway. To clubs and bars. There's a woman downstairs. With matt-grey hair. And she smiles when she tells me. There's no room for me here. They've got it in the city. They've got it in the country. But here in the suburbs. It's all so wishy-washy. It's all so wishy-washy. I got another place. This time with a fireplace. And a woman can come around. Write poetry and feel safe. I said it's good for me now. But I'm not being fed. I said it's good for me now. But I'm not being fed.
