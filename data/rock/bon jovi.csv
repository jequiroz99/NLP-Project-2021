always,This Romeo is bleeding. But you can't see his blood. It's nothing but some feelings. That this old dog kicked up. It's been raining since you left me. Now I'm drowning in the flood. You see I've always been a fighter. But without you I give up. Now I can't sing a love song. Like the way it's meant to be. Well I guess I'm not that good anymore. But baby that's just me. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you always. Now your pictures that you left behind. Are just memories of a different life. Some that made us laugh. Some that made us cry. One that made you have to say good bye. What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair. To touch your lips to hold you near. When you say your prayers try to understand. I've made mistakes I'm just a man. When he holds you close. When he pulls you near. When he says the words. You've been needing to hear. I'll wish I was him cause these words are mine. To say to you till the end of time. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. If you told me to cry for you I could. If you told me to die for you I would. Take a look at my face. There's no price I won't pay. To say these words to you. Well there ain't no luck in this loaded dice. But baby if you give me just one more try. We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives. We'll find a place where the sun still shines. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you always
it's my life,"This ain't a song for the broken-hearted. No silent prayer for the faith-departed. I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd. You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud. It's my life. It's now or never. I ain't gonna live forever. I just want to live while I'm alive. (It's my life). My heart is like an open highway. Like Frankie said. I did it my way.

livin' on a prayer,"Once upon a time. Not so long ago. Tommy used to work on the docks. Union's been on strike. He's down on his luck. It's tough, so tough. Gina works the diner all day. Working for her man, she brings home her pay. For love, for love. She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got. It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not. We've got each other and that's a lot for love. We'll give it a shot. We're half way there. Livin' on a prayer. Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear. Livin' on a prayer. Tommy got his six string in hock. Now he's holding in. When he used to make it talk, so tough. It's tough. Gina dreams of running away. When she cries in the night Tommy whispers.

i'll be there for you,"I guess this time you're really leaving. I heard your suitcase say goodbye. And as my broken heart lies bleeding. You say true love is suicide. You say you've cried a thousand rivers. And now you're swimming for the shore. You left me drowning in my tears. And you won't save me anymore. I'll pray to God to give me one more chance, girl.

bed of roses,"Sitting here, wasted and wounded. At this old piano. Trying hard to capture the moment. This morning I don't know. 'Cause a bottle of vodka. Is still lodged in my head. And some blond gave me nightmares. I think that she's still in my bed. As I dream about movies. They won't make of me when I'm dead. With an ironclad fist I wake up. And french kiss the morning. While some marching band keeps. It's own beat in my head. While we're talking. About all of the things that I long to believe. About love, the truth. And what you mean to me. And the truth is baby, you're all that I need. I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses. For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails. I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is. And lay you down on a bed of roses. Well, I'm so far away. That each step that I take is on my way home. A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night. Just to see through this payphone. Still I run out of time. Or it's hard to get through. Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you. I'll just close my eyes and whisper. Baby, blind love is true. I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses. For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails. I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is. And lay you down on a bed of roses. Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry. The barkeeper's wig's crooked. And she's giving me the eye. Well, I might have said yeah. But I laughed so hard I think I died. When you close your eyes. Know I'll be thinking about you. While my mistress, she calls me. To stand in her spotlight again. Tonight I won't be alone. But you know that don't. Mean I'm not lonely. I've got nothing to prove. For it's you that I'd die to defend. I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses. For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails. I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is. And lay you down. I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses. For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails. I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is. And lay you down on a bed of roses"
misunderstood,"Should I? Could I?. Have said the wrong things right a thousand times. If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind. If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine. You cried, I died. I should have shut my mouth, things headed south. As the words slipped off my tongue,. They sounded dumb. If this old heart could talk,. It'd say you're the one. I'm wasting time when I think about it. [Chorus:]. I should have drove all night,. I would have run all the lights. I was misunderstood. I stumbled like my words, Did the best I could. Damn, misunderstood. Could I? Should I?. Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night. Staying out too late with all my friends. You found me passed out in the yard again. You cried, I tried. To stretch the truth, but didn't lie. It's not so bad when you think about it. [Chorus:]. I should have drove all night,. I would have run all the lights. I was misunderstood. I stumbled like my words, did the best I could. I 'm hanging outside your door. I've been here before. Misunderstood. I stumbled like my words, did the best I could. Damn, misunderstood. Intentions good. It's you and I, just think about it.... [Chorus:]. I should have drove all night. I would have run all the lights. I was misunderstood. I stumbled like my words, did the best I could. Misunderstood. I 'm hanging outside your door. I've been here before. Misunderstood. I stumbled like my words, did the best I could. Damn, misunderstood. Intentions good."
you give love a bad name,"Shot through the heart and you're to blame. Darlin' you give love, a bad name. An angel's smile is what you sell. You promise me heaven, then put me through hell.

Shot through the heart and you're to blame. You give love a bad name. I play my part and you play your game. You give love a bad name. You give love a bad name. You paint your smile on your lips.

blaze of glory,"I wake up in the morning. And I raise my weary head. I've got an old coat for a pillow. And the earth was last night's bed. I don't know where I'm going. Only God knows where I've been. I'm a devil on the road. A six gun lover. A candle in the wind. When you're brought into this world. They say you're born in sin. Well at least they gave me something. I didn't have to steal or have to win. Well they tell me that I'm wanted. Yeah I'm a wanted man. I'm colt in your stable. I'm what Cain was to Abel. Mister catch me if you can. I'm going down in a blaze of glory. Take me now but know the truth. I'm going down in a blaze of glory. Lord I never drew first. But I drew first blood. I'm no ones son. Call me young gun. You ask about my conscience. And I offer you my soul. You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man. Well I ask if I'll grow old. You ask me if I known love. And what it's like to sing songs in the rain. Well,I've seen love come. And I've seen it shot down. I've seen it die in vain. Shot down in a blaze of glory. Take me now but know the truth. I'm going down in a blaze of glory. Lord I never drew first. But I drew first blood. I'm the devil's son. Call me young gun. Each night I go to bed. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. No I ain't looking for forgiveness. But before I'm six foot deep. Lord,I got to ask a favor. And I'll hope You'll understand. 'Cause I've lived life to the fullest. Let this boy die like a man. Staring down the bullet. Let me make my final stand. Shot down in a blaze of glory. Take me now but know the truth. I'm going down in a blaze of glory. Lord I never drew first. But I drew first blood. I'm the devil's son. Call me young gun. I'm young gun,. Young gun yeah yeahh young gun"
thank you for loving me,"It´s hard for me to say the things. I want to say sometimes. There´s no one here but you and me. And that broken old street light. Lock the doors. leave the world outside. All I´ve got to give to you. Are these five words and I. Thank you for loving me. For being my eyes. When I couldn´t see. For parting my lips. When I couldn´t breathe. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for loving me. I never knew I had a dream. Until that dream was you. When I look into your eyes. The sky´s a different blue. Cross my heart. I wear no disguise. If I tried, you´d make believe. That you believed my lies. Thank you for loving me. For being my eyes. When I couldn´t see. For parting my lips. When I couldn´t breathe. Thank you for loving me. You pick me up when I fall down. You ring the bell before they count me out. If I was drowning you would part the sea. And risk your own life to rescue me. Lock the doors. leave the world outside. All I´ve got to give to you. Are these five words and I. Thank you for loving me. For being my eyes. When I couldn´t see. For parting my lips. When I couldn´t breathe. Thank you for loving me.

these days,"I was walking around, just a face in the crowd. Trying to keep myself out of the rain. Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown. Wondered if I might end up the same. There's a man out on the corner, singing old songs about change. Everybody got their cross to bare, these days. She came looking for some shelter with a suitcase full of dreams. To a motel room on the boulevard. I guess she's trying to be James Dean. She's seen all the disciples and all the wanna be's. No one wants to be themselves these days. Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days. These days - the stars seem out of reach. These days - there ain't a ladder on the streets. These days - are fast, nothing last in this graceless age. There ain't anybody left but us these days. Jimmy shoes busted both his legs, trying to learn to fly. From a second story window, he just jumped and closed his eyes. His mamma said he was crazy - he said mamma ""I've got to try"". Don't you know that all my heroes died. And I guess I'd rather die than fade away. These days - the stars ain't out of reach. But these days - there ain't a ladder on the streets. These days - are fast, nothing lasts, it's a graceless age. Even innocence has caught the midnight train. And there ain't anybody left but us these days. I know Rome's still burning. Though the times have changed. This world keeps turning round and round and round and round. These days. These days - the stars ain't out of reach. These days - there ain't a ladder on the streets. These days - are fast, nothing lasts. There ain't no time to waste. There ain't anybody left to take the blame. And there ain't anybody left but us these days. There ain't anybody left but us these days"
wanted dead or alive,"It's all the same, only the names will change. Everyday it seems we're wasting away. Another place where the faces are so cold. I'd drive all night just to get back home. I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted dead or alive. Wanted dead or alive. Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days. The people I meet always go their separate places. Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink. And times when you're all alone all you do is think. And I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive. Wanted (wanted) dead or alive. Oh and I ride!. I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive. And I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back. I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back. I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall. I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all. 'Cause I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive"
hallelujah,"I've heard there was. A secret chord. That David played, and. It pleased the Lord. But you don't really care. For music, do you?. It goes like this:. The fourth, the fifth. The minor fall, the major lift. The baffled king. Composing Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Your faith was strong. But you needed proof. You saw her bathing. On the roof. Her beauty and the. Moonlight overthrew you. She tied you to a kitchen chair. She broke your throne. And she cut your hair. And from your lips. She drew the Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Maybe I've been here before. I've seen this room. I've walked this floor. I used to live alone. Before I knew you. I've seen your flag on the marble arch. Love is not a victory march. It's a cold and. It's a broken Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. There was a time. You let me know. What's real and going on below. But now you never show. It to me, do you?. I remember when. I moved in, you. Your holy dark. Was moving too. And every breath we drew. Was Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Maybe there's a God above. And all I ever. Learned from love. Was how to shoot. At somebody. Who outdrew you. It's not a cry. You can hear at night. It's not somebody. Who's seen the light. It's a cold and. It's a broken Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah"

Gonna need a miracle. 'Cause your heart's doing time. And your conscience is calling you out. It ain't all for nothing. Life ain't written in the sand. I know the tide is coming.

never say goodbye,"As I sit in this smokey room. The night about to end. I pass my time as a stranger. But this bottle´s my only friend. Remember when we used to park. On Butler Street out in the dark. Remember when we lost the keys. And you lost more than that in my backseat. Remember how we used to talk. About busting out - we´d break their hearts. Together - forever. Chorus:. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. You and me and my old friends. Hoping it would never end. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. Holdin' on - we got to try. Holdin' on to never say goodbye. Remember days of skipping school. Racing cars and being cool. With a six pack and the radio. We didn't need no place to go. Remember at the prom that night. You and me we had a fight. But the band they played our favorite song. And I held you in my arms so strong. We danced so close. We danced so slow. And I swore I'd never let you go. Together - forever. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. You and me and my old friends. Hoping it would never end. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. Holdin' on - we got to try. Holdin' on to never say goodbye. Solo. I guess you'd say we used to talk. About busting out. We'd break their hearts. Together - forever. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. You and me and my old friends. Hoping it would never end. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. Holdin' on - we got to try. Holdin' on to never say goodbye"

Hey, my name is Jim, where did I go wrong. My life's a bargain basement, all the good shit's gone. I just can't hold a job, where do I belong. Been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on. My name is Billy Jean, my love was bought and sold. I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old. My foster daddy went and took my innocence away. The street life ain't much better but at least I'm getting paid. Tuesday just might go my way. It can't get worse than yesterday. Thursdays, Fridays aint been kind. But somehow I survive. Chorus. Hey, man, I'm alive. I'm taking each day and night at a time. Yeah, I'm down but I know I'll get by. Hey, hey, hey, hey man, I've got to live my life. Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice. I'm feeling like a monday. But someday I'll be Saturday night. Now I can't say my name or tell you where I am. I wanna blow myself away, don't know if I can. I wish that I could be in some other time and place. With someone else's soul and someone else's face. Tuesday just might go my way. Can't get worse than yesterday. Thursdays, Fridays aint been kind. But somehow I'll survive. Hey, man I'm alive. I'm taking each day a night at a time. Yeah, I'm down but I know I'll get by.

have a nice day,"Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?. Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?. Momma, can you help me try to understand. Is innocence the difference 'tween a boy and a man?. My daddy lived to die,. that's just the price that he paid. Sacrificed his life just slaving away. Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto. that gets me thru the night. I ain't gonna do what I don't want to; I'm gonna live my life. Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice. Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly. When the world gets in my face, I say.... Have a nice day. Have a nice day. Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems. We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams. Let me be the first to shake a helping hand. Anybody brave enough to take a stand. I've knocked on every door on every dead-end street. Looking for forgiveness and what's left to believe. Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto. that gets me thru the night. I ain't gonna do what I don't' want to; I'm gonna live my life.

"janie, don't take your love to town","Sitting here just watching you sleep. Wish I could slip inside and be. In some technicolor dream. But the air's too thick for one of us to breathe. I'm not fool enough to think. You couldn't live life without me. I didn't come this far to throw the towel in. I didn't fight this hard to walk away. If I ain't smart enough to say I'm sorry. It's just because the words got in the way. I remember how it used to be. I was you and you were me. We were more than just the same. Now these shoes don't fit, my skin's too tight. When you want a kiss, I take a bite. Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights. Last night I drank enough to drown. Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health. Look, we both know how much i've let you down. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. If i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away. Janie don't you take your love to town. You deserve a shooter, a saint. Someone to give it to you straight. To find the soul throught flesh and bone. My life's a treasure, full of sunny weather. But it's left me feeling cold. Now all you want to do is take me home. I hated you, the night you said you loved me. I hated you, 'cause I couldn't love myself. I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me. I got one foot in, one foot off the ground. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. If i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away. Janie don't you take your love to town. Sitting here while you're fast asleep. In the bathroom by the sink. Trying to write the right words down. I turn out the lights, close my eyes. There ain't no prayers or kiss goodnight. What i'll forget to say tomorrow, i'll say now. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. If i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away. Janie don't you take your love to town"
living with the ghost,"Marry me to the blue sky. Bury me in that long last drop of hard rain. Meet me where they stop time. That's you to me on the shovel that's digging this grave. Till I can waltz on a moonbeam. Till I can find a way to turn. all tears into wine. I'll hitch my ride to a day dream. Can't unkiss the lips that love is. leaving behind. I ain't living with the ghost. No future living in the past. I've seen what hate has done to hope. Tomorrow wasn't built to last. I ain't living with the ghost. How can I scream I'm scared to breathe. I wrote each word you gave the. Toast. But we were fire and gasoline. I ain't living with the ghost. I set my sails over wheat fields. Rode waves of amber let a new sun. shine on my face. I dropped the sword put down my shield. I left your scars for the stars. Guiding my way. I traded hurting for healing. I must admit that I was reeling. Now I'm feeling just fine. Traded nightmares for dreaming. Go tell your shadows. That I got out alive. I ain't living with the ghost. No future living in the past. I've seen what hate has done to hope. I found the tree I cut the rope. Tomorrow wasn't built to last. I ain't living with the ghost. How can I scream I'm scared to breathe. I wrote each word you gave the. Toast. But we were fire and gasoline. I ain't living with the ghost. Last night I had this dream. I saw a man wash his feet. In the church holy water. He worked up to his knees. From his arms to his neck. Said I'm over my head. He was crying trying to get some relief. Lord, I'm just trying to get some relief. I had this dream. That man was me. I ain't living with the ghost. No future living in the past. I've seen what hate has done to hope. I found the tree I cut the rope. Tomorrow wasn't built to last. I ain't living with the ghost. How can I scream I'm scared to breathe. I wrote each word you gave the. Toast. But we were fire and gasoline. Now I ain't living with the ghost"

And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you always. Now your pictures that you left behind. Are just memories of a different life. Some that made us laugh. Some that made us cry. One that made you have to say good bye. What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair. To touch your lips to hold you near. When you say your prayers try to understand. I've made mistakes I'm just a man. When he holds you close. When he pulls you near. When he says the words. You've been needing to hear. I'll wish I was him cause these words are mine. To say to you till the end of time. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. If you told me to cry for you I could. If you told me to die for you I would. Take a look at my face. There's no price I won't pay. To say these words to you. Well there ain't no luck in this loaded dice. But baby if you give me just one more try. We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives. We'll find a place where the sun still shines. And I will love you baby always. And I'll be there forever and a day always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme. And I know when I die you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you always

amen,"Last night I had a dream. The dream I had was true. I fell through the stars. Went walking on the moon. Burned like a thousand candles in her arms. Her skin under my fingertips. The honeysuckle on her LIPS. Sweeter than a man deserves to taste. Mercy Mercy, What else can I say?. But Amen. Amen. Amen. Last night we were born together. It was like we'd always been. I'll be with her forever. If I don't see her again. We poured the wine until our cup ran over. Unfolding like some mystery. Inside of her like poetry. A thousand horses running through my veins. Mercy Mercy what else can I say. But Amen. Amen. I laid down in her garden. Naked on her floor. Windows up, those curtains blowing. She don't lock the door. Amen. Amen. At the banquet table. A beggar at a feast. I felt her tongue between my lips. And I forgot to breath. We stayed there 'til the candles burned the carpet. Last night I had a dream. The dream I had was true. Mercy Mercy, what else can I say. Mercy Mercy, I'll kneel down and prayed. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen"

another reason to believe,"BOUNCE B-side; JBJ, RS, Billy Falcon and J.Steele. Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love. Love lives in New York City. He got a place off of the park. But he was standing in the ruins. And in his hand's a broken heart. He called an army of his angels. I hear they had to hide their wings. It was them who brought you water. If you listen closely; I know you can hear the choir sing. Hey Halleluiah baby, rise up. Hold out your hands and reach higher. Get up on your feet, rise up. Let it flow through you baby. Running through your veins. Like a healing rain. Everywhere you'll see. Another reason to believe. South of Canal Street. Right there in a mother's eyes. At a table in a restaurant window. In a taxi passing by. I saw Love go running up that stairwell. And the sky came falling down. It was him and a newborn baby's cry. He was there to make that sound. Keeps this whole world spinning around. Say Halleluiah baby, rise up. Hold out your hands and reach higher. Get up on your feet, rise up. Let it flow through you baby. Running through your veins. Like a healing rain. Everywhere you'll see. Say Halleluiah baby. It's different than it was before. Now we need it even more. Fire falling from the sky. Innocence just said goodbye. It may never be the same. Maybe it was time to change. Time to grieve, time to cry. Time to live, time to fly. Sing Halleluiah baby, rise up. Hold out your hands and reach higher. Get up on your feet, rise up. Let it flow through you baby. Running through your veins. Like a healing rain. Rise up. Hold out your hands and reach higher. Get up on your feet, rise up. You've got a reason to believe, rise up. Another reason to believe, rise up. You've got a reason to believe, rise up. Just a reason to believe"

"august 7, 4:15","It was another day. A perfect Texas afternoon. A mother and two children. Play the way they always do. As they raced home from the mailbox. A mother and her son. Against a little girl of 6 years old. The independent one. The deputies went door to door. Through all the neighborhood. They said I got some news to tell you folks. I’m afraid it ain’t so good. Somehow something happened. Someone got away. Someone got the answers. For what happened here today. Oh no, ho no, oh no, no, no, no. Tell me it was just a dream – August 7, 4:15. God close His eyes & the world got mean. August 7, 4:15. Now the people from the papers. And the local TV news. Tried to find the reason. Cop dogs sniffed around for clues. Someone shouted “Hit & Run”. The coroner cried “Foul”. Her blue dress was what she wore. The day they laid her body down. Oh no, ho no, oh no, no, no, no. Tell me it was just a dream – August 7, 4:15. God close His eyes & the world got mean. August 7, 4:15. I know tonight that there’s an angel. Up on Heaven’s highest hill. And no one there can hurt you baby. No one ever will. Somewhere someone’s conscience. Is like a burning bed. The flames are all around you. How you gonna sleep again. Oh no, ho no, oh no, no, no, no. Tell me it was just a dream – August 7, 4:15. God close His eyes & the world got mean. August 7, 4:15."

And the truth is baby, you're all that I need. I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses. For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails. I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is. And lay you down on a bed of roses. Well, I'm so far away. That each step that I take is on my way home. A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night. Just to see through this payphone. Still I run out of time. Or it's hard to get through. Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you. I'll just close my eyes and whisper. Baby, blind love is true. I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses. For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails. I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is. And lay you down on a bed of roses. Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry. The barkeeper's wig's crooked. And she's giving me the eye. Well, I might have said yeah. But I laughed so hard I think I died. When you close your eyes. Know I'll be thinking about you. While my mistress, she calls me. To stand in her spotlight again. Tonight I won't be alone. But you know that don't. Mean I'm not lonely. I've got nothing to prove. For it's you that I'd die to defend. I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses. For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails. I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is.

Better think twice, oh oh, before falling in love. What’s in it for you?. He’s trying to shoot you down. Long hot summer nights. Go out now and find that girl and hold her tight.

For a debutante you're a real hard woman. But I love you just the same. How come you're sad when I get happy?. Why do you laugh when I want to cry?. Tell me why when I say I need you. You turn around and you say goodbye. Why do you think that a heart's so fragile?. Can you tell me why love's so blind?. Just like a magnet you pull me under. I can't resist you, we're two of a kind. Chorus:. Billy, Billy. Ain't love hard to explain?. For a debutante you're a real hard wmoan. But I love you just the same. Billy , Billy. We're better lovers than friends. Life is like a movie but this ain't pretend. There really doesn't have to be a happy end. Chorus:. Billy, Billy. Ain't love hard to explain?. For a debutante you're a real hard woman. But I love you just the same. I never said you had to walk on water. Or that I could ever stop the rain. Some times we break up just to make up, baby. And we don't care who's to blame. Billy, Billy. Ain't love hard to explain?. For a debutante you're a real hard woman. But I love you just the same. Billy, Billy. Can we be lovers and friends. Life if like a movie but this ain't pretend"

Who said hey keep the change baby. Billy get your guns. There's trouble blowing like a hurricane. Billy get your guns. That's the price on your head for the. Price of fame. And it'll never change
bitter wine,"We met some time ago when we were almost young. It never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from. I didn't have much money so I stole you a rose. You were dressed like an orphan in Salvation Army clothes. I never thought I'd lose you, no I'd rather go blind. I thought I saw the future but the fortune teller lied. Your love was my salvation, it could always get me high. What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine. I know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes. When I was choking on the words to say. You stuck your fingers down my throat. The first night I said I loved you. You told me to go to hell. You were giving me head on that creaky old bed. At the Old Duval motel. Just like everything even good love has to die. Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye. Your love was my salvation, it could always get me high. What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine. Oh yeah. Just like everything good love has to die. Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye. No one even cried, we were one of a kind. One of a kind, yeah. Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by. What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine. Your love was my salvation, it could always get me high. You take the bath of holy water, now all that's left is bitter wine"
blame it on the love of rock & roll,"Wooh!. Ooh yeah!. Comon'!. First time I heard the music. I thought it was my own. I could feel it in my heartbeat. I could feel it in my bones. My momma thinks I'm crazy. Dad says I'm insane. I got this boogie woogie fever. Burning in my veins. They took me to a doctor. But it's too late for me. They dragged me to a preacher. That they saw on their TV. Who said that for a small donation. My lost soul would be saved. I said I don't think so preacher. I'll come back another day. All I want, is to be a Rolling Stone. They don't understand what we all know. It feels so good that it ought to be illegal. I got my vaccination from a phonagraph needle. I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old. Blame it on the love of rock & roll. My teachers didn't like me they always. Tried to put me down. 'Cause I wore my hair too long. I played my music way too loud. Every little boy wants to learn to play guitar. So he can pick up all the chicks. And be a rock-n-roll star. They said it won't last, but they misunderstood. If people think it's bad then I'll be bad for good. It feels so good that it ought to be illegal. I got my vaccination from a phonagraph needle. I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old. Blame it on the love of rock & roll Blame it on the love, blame it on the love. Dad don't understand what the little girls know. Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll. All I wanted, all I ever needed. My guitar gave to me. Every song I've sung blame it on love. Every war I've won blame it on love. Everything I've done blame it on love. Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll. It feels so good that it ought to be illegal. I got my vaccination from a phonagraph needle. I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old. Blame it on the love of rock & roll. Blame it on the love, blame it on the love. Dad don't get what the little girls know. Blame it on the love of rock-n-roll."
blaze of glory,"I wake up in the morning. And I raise my weary head. I've got an old coat for a pillow. And the earth was last night's bed. I don't know where I'm going.

You ask about my conscience. And I offer you my soul. You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man. Well I ask if I'll grow old. You ask me if I known love. And what it's like to sing songs in the rain. Well,I've seen love come. And I've seen it shot down. I've seen it die in vain. Shot down in a blaze of glory. Take me now but know the truth. I'm going down in a blaze of glory. Lord I never drew first. But I drew first blood. I'm the devil's son. Call me young gun. Each night I go to bed. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. No I ain't looking for forgiveness. But before I'm six foot deep. Lord,I got to ask a favor. And I'll hope You'll understand. 'Cause I've lived life to the fullest. Let this boy die like a man. Staring down the bullet. Let me make my final stand. Shot down in a blaze of glory. Take me now but know the truth. I'm going down in a blaze of glory. Lord I never drew first. But I drew first blood. I'm the devil's son. Call me young gun. I'm young gun,. Young gun yeah yeahh young gun"

blood money,"Hey Patty Garrett that's what I used to call you. They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you. They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver. They paid you some money to sell them my blood. But you say this ain't about me, this ain't about you. Or the good and the bad times we've both been through. When the lines between brothers and justice have changed. You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away. I wonder what would have happened. If you were the killer. And I was the hero.

captain crash and the beauty queen from mars,"Dressed up for a big date. Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now. A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face. She was one of a kind. She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella. And roller skates in bed. He rides the greyhound from his hometown. When he comes around cause they don't let him drive now. Mixed up as a milkshake. But make no mistake. Crash looking at the stars. Chorus:. You and me. We're invincible together. We can be also tragical, whatever. Dressed up just like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar. Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars. Share a toothpick, trading lipstick. Watching traffic for days at the diner. holding hands, making big plans. Playing superman, he was wearing eyeliner. Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm. Chorus. They're drunk on love as you can get. Getting high on lust and cigarettes. Living life with no regrets. at least they're gonna try to fly. Chorus:. You and me. We're invincible together. We can be also tragical, whatever. We're Cid and Nancy. Fred and Ginger. Clyde and Bonnie. Liz and Richard. Kurt and Courtney. Baccal and Bogie.

And cut my eyes so I can't see. I can't see you looking back as you walk out the door. Cold, hard heart. Cold, cruel heart. What's it gonna take. To break your cold hard heart. I was a lover lost at sea. You found me washed up on the beach. You took me home, you gave me breakfast. I said I'd offer you protection, but you didn't charge a fee. Cold, hard heart. Cold, cruel heart. What's it gonna take. To break your cold hard heart. Cold, cruel heart. Cold, cruel heart. What's it gonna take. To break your cold hard heart. What are you hiding underneath that shirt. If you're the one to run babe. Then you don't feel the hurt. Her hair so brown, and eyes so green. You used to say I made good company. She'd bring me wine and sip her tea. Then you'd give yourself what you could give to me. Cold, hard heart. Cold, cruel heart. What's it gonna take. To break your cold hard heart. Cold, cruel heart. Cold, cruel heart. What's it gonna take. To break your cold hard heart. What's it gonna take..."

crazy love,"The city sounds like a symphony. A cabbie screams obscenities. The horns are honking jazz in the night. Her street is lit like a Christmas tree. This place is my amphetamine. She junks me but it's alright. In her summer dress she parts the sea. Her hair wrapped up in rosary beads. Everyone else is gone but her and me. Chorus:. Here she comes, it's crazy love. Here it comes again. That crazy thing called love. Here she comes, it's crazy love. Here it comes again. Sitting on my stoop. I lit one up and put the ashes in my coffee cup. And watched the world passing me by. Throw a coat of paint on this rusty heart. Ain't it funny how life imitates art. Saint Valentine he's got bloody knees tonight. But when she's walking down the street. The sidewalk's there to kiss her feet. Chorus:. Here she comes, it's crazy love. Here it comes again. That crazy thing called love. Here she comes, it's crazy love. Here it comes again. She needs me, pleads me. Wraps me in her loving charms. She'll tease me, squeeze me. But I'm the man when I'm in her arms. Now the angels sing a melody. That they wrote for her explicitly. That no one hears but her and me. Now wait a minute… wait I can't believe my eyes. Who's that coming around the corner?. Ay, she's lookin' fine ain't she? … get out the way!. No, no, no get out the way… look at those high heel sneakers…. Chorus:. Here she comes, it's crazy love. Here it comes again. That crazy thing called love. Here she comes, it's crazy love"

does anybody really fall in love anymore?,"New Jersey Demo. I walked down the street. People passing me by. They look me up and down. But they don't look me in the eye. I'm just another stranger. In my own home town. Looking for an angel. But heaven can't be found. I say, hey, are you lonely tonight. Hey, hey, hey I'm gonna make it through. But that don't make it right. Chorus. Does anybody really fall in love anymore?. Does anybody really give their heart to somebody?. Does anybody really ever open that door?. I know, I know, you've got to love somebody. I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love. There's a sad face in the mirror. And I'm sad to say it's me. Like a ghost up in the attic. Only love can set him free. I've been running around in circles. On this roller coaster ride. There's a lonely world around me. I get sucked in by the tide. I said, hey, love ain't no crime. So why is everybody so afraid to cross that line?. Chorus. Instrumental. Hey, hey, hey, I'll be alright. 'Cause I know that someone somewhere's. Gonna say these words tonight. Chorus"

dry county,Across the border they turn. Water into wine. Some say it's the devil's blood. They're squeezing from the vine. Some say it's a saviour. In these hard and desperate times. For me it helps me to forget. That we're just born to die. I came here like so many did. To find the better life. To find my piece of easy street. To finally be alive. And I know nothing good comes easy. All good things take some time. I made my bed I lie in it. To die in it's the crime. You can't help but prosper. When the street are paved with gold. They say the oil wells ran deeper here. Than anybody's known. I packed up on my wife and kid. And left them back at home. Now there's nothing in this paydirt. The ghost are all I know. Now the oil's gone. The money's gone. And the jobs are gone. Still we're hangin' on. Down in dry county. They're swimming in the sand. Praying for some holy water. To wash the sins from off our hands. Here in dry county. The promise has run dry. Where nobody cries. And no one's getting out of here alive. In the blessed name of Jesus. I heard a preacher say. That we are God's children. And that he'd be back someday. And I hoped that he knew. Something as he drank his cup of wine. I didn't have too good of a feeling. As I head out to the night. I cursed the sky to open. I begged the clouds for rain. I prayed to God for water. For this burning in my veins. It was like my soul's on fire. And I had to watch the flames. All my dreams went up in ashes. And my future blew away. Now the oil's gone. The money's gone. And the jobs are gone. Still we're hangin' on. Down in dry county. They're swimming in the sand. Praying for some holy water. To wash the sins from off our hands. Here in dry county. The promise has run dry. Where nobody cries. And no one's getting out of here alive. Men spend their whole lives. Waiting praying for their big reward. But it seems sometimes. The payoff leaves you feeling. Like a dirty whore. If I could choose the way I'll die. Make it by the gun or knife. 'Couse the other way there's too much pain. night after night after night.... Down in dry county. They're swimming in the sand. Praying for some holy water. To wash the sins from off our hands. Here in dry county. The promise has run dry. Where nobody cries. And no one's getting out of here alive
dyin' ain't much of a livin',A whiskey bottle comforts me. And tells me not to cry. While a full moon says a prayer for me. I try to close my eyes. But the night's there to remind me. Of the guns and the early graves. The ghosts appear as I fall asleep. To sing an outlaw's serenade. Dyin' ain't much of a livin'. When you're livin' on the run. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. Is it too late to ask for forgiveness. For the things that I have done. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. The desert's been a friend to me. It covers me by night. And a snakebite's not my enemy. But it taught me how to fight. All this fame don't bring you freedom. Though it wears a thin disguise. When an outlaw is just a man to me. And a man has to die. Dyin' ain't much of a livin'. When you're livin' on the run. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. Is it too late to ask for forgiveness. For the things that I have done. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. And I hope someone will pray for me. When it's my turn to die... PRAY FOR ME !!!. Dyin' ain't much of a livin'. When you're livin' on the run. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young. Is it too late to ask for forgiveness. For the things that I have done. Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young.

I left them there for you to take. But, know that every word was a piece of my heart. You've been the blood in my veins. The only one who knows my middle name.

Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud. Chorus. Have I said too much. Maybe I haven't said enough. But know that every word was a piece of my heart. Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch. Maybe I've lost my guts - there, is that truth enough. Hey now, Hey now. You know these love letters mix with whisky. Just don't light a match when you kiss me. Though I'll blow away, you know I'll be back soon. Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, am I talking just a little too loud. Chorus. Have I said too much. Maybe I haven't said enough.

Goodbye, so long, I'm moving on. Chorus: I've had enough of crying, bleeding, sweating, dying. Hear me when I say, gonna live my life everyday. I'm gonna touch the sky, spread these wings and fly. I ain't here to play. Gonna live my life everyday. Hit the gas, take the wheel, I just made myself a deal. There ain't nothing gonna get in my way. Everyday. Guitar Solo. Goodbye, so long, I'm moving on. Chorus I've had enough of crying, bleeding, sweating, dying. Hear me when I say, gonna live my life everyday. I'm gonna touch the sky and spread these wings and fly. I ain't here to play. Gonna live my life everyday. . . Oh I, Oh I, Gonna live my life everyday. I'm gonna touch the sky and spread these wings and fly. Gonna live my life everyday"

hardest part is the night,"In the heat of the street of the city. A young boy hides the pain. And he walks so tall, trying to hang on. But he knows he's going down again. I know he's going down.... Darkness fades he's the prince of his city. In a place where they all know your name. You can see in their eyes life so paralyzed.. Your just a pawn in a losin' game. You lose at life it ain't no game. Hear their cries. The hardest part is the night. (In the night, hear their cries, in the night). Stay alive. The hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night.... All alone in a place where the lonely. They all have to walk through the rain. And they dance on the edge where you only. Only pray that it has to end. That the night ain't no friend. Hear their cries. The hardest part is the night. (In the night, hear their cries, in the night). Stay alive. The hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night.... (X 2). These four walls they could tell you some stories. About lying and dying and fame. There's a price that you pay for the glory. About losing and choosing and pain.. Hear their cries. The hardest part is the night. In the night, hear their cries, in the night. Stay alive. In the night, stay alive, in the night"

My hearts breaking even, now there's no use we even try. Hey I cried, Yeah I lied, Hell I almost died. Don't got a reason, let's just fold the cards and say good-bye.

i am,"How you spend your minutes are what matters. All tomorrows come from yesterdays. When you're feeling broken, bruised and sometimes shattered. Blow out the candles on the cake. Like everything's a big mistake. It seems you always wait for life to happen. And your last buck can't buy a lucky break. If all we've got is us then life's worth living. And if you're in, you know I'm in. I'm ready and I'm willing. I am. When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you. No one's there to understand. I am. I'll be there to be that someone. When you think that no one is there to hold your hand. I am. We're just who we are, there's no pretending. It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin. Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending. And if you're in you know I'm in. I'm ready and I'm willing. Chorus: I am. When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you. No one's there to understand. I am. I'll be there to be that someone. When you think that no one is there to hold your hand. I am. I ain't got no halo hanging over my head. I ain't gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you. I am, I am. Chorus: I am. When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you. No one's there to understand. I am. I'll be there to be that someone. When you think that no one is there to hold your hand. I am. When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you. No one's there to understand. I am.

And courage built I won't let go. What we need right now is... soul. I can't do this, you cant do that. They feed us line but I won't act. And all good things will come to pass. But the truth is all you have to have. And would you lie for it?. (do you) cry for it?. (Would you) die for it?. Would you. I belive, I belive. With every breath that I breathe. You and me can turn a whisper to a scream. I belive, I belive. You gave it all, then you gave morre. You know what you came here for. You'll pay the cost, like it's your cross to bear. Are you scheme for it,. scream for it, bleed for it?. Would you. I belive, I belive. Belive we're still worth. The fight you'll see. There's hope for this world tonight. I belive, I belive. Don't look up on your movie screens. In record store or magazines. Close your eyes and you will see. That you are all you really need. I belive, I belive. With every breath that I breathe.

I can forgive you but I won't re-live you. I ain't the same scared kid I used to be. I'm gonna live. I'm gonna survive. I don't want the world to pass me by. I'm gonna dream. I ain't gonna die. Thinking my life was just a lie. I wanna be loved. I wanna be loved. I found a picture. Our so-called family tree, yeah. I broke all the branches lookin' for answers. Don't you know that ain't how it's supposed to be?. I'm gonna live. I'm gonna survive. I don't want the world to pass me by. I'm gonna dream. I ain't gonna die. Thinking my life was just a lie. I wanna give. I'm ready to try. Willing to lay it on the line. I wanna be loved. I wanna be…. I ain't gonna cry; I don't wanna scream. But I got so much left unsaid inside of me. I'm gonna live. I'm gonna survive. Don't want the world to pass me by. I'm gonna dream. I ain't gonna die. Thinking my life was just a lie. I wanna give. I'm ready to try. Willing to lay it on the line. I wanna beloved. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be love. I wanna be loved. I wanna be loved. I wanna be loved. . (fonte: site oficial)"
i want you,"The last time that I saw her. Was the night she said goodbye. She said that love's a stranger. And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did .... As she packed up her belongings. Baby wouldn't look me in the eye. But I could see a tear roll. Off her face. As we both tried so hard. Not to cry she said. I never wanted the stars. Never shot for the moon. I like them right where they are. All I wanted was you. So baby just turn away. Because I can't face the truth. All I'm trying to say. Is all I wanted was you. I tried so hard to remember. When where how why love went away. I tried to drown myself in pity. But her memory kept calling your name, yes it did... I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings. All the things that my money brings. And the servants to paint the sky blue. And I worked so hard seven days a week. And built a fortress for your heart to keep. If I could I'd wrap these words up for you. I never wanted the stars. Never shot for the moon. I like them right where they are. All I wanted was you. So baby just turn away. Because I can't face the truth. All I'm trying to say. Is all I wanted was you. I may have built for you a dreamhouse. But never thought you were alone. I filled the party up with company. But never made our house a home. All I got is my guitar, these chords and the truth. All I got is my guitar.... but all I want is you. (CHORUS)."
i will drive you home,"Here comes the next big thing. There's a new gun in town. There'll be a faster one. Before the sun goes down. They've come to kick the tires. They'd like to take a spin. See how it takes the turns. See if it breaks or bends. But I will drive you home. I want you to know that. I will drive you home. Hell, it ain't nothing new. Everything new gets old. Maybe some glitter's gone. But we're still good as gold. When some driver comes. And tries to jump the start. Thinks he can steal your love. Hot wire your heart. But I will drive you home. I want you to know that. I will drive you home. Let 'em rev their engines. Let 'em spin their wheels. All they've got is shine. They're just chrome and steel. But I will drive you home. Here comes that faster fast. Here comes that higher high. As we walk on past. They just step aside. I will drive you home. I want you to know that. I will drive you home. Let 'em rev their engines. Let 'em spin their wheels. All they got is shine. They're just chrome and steel. When they raise the flag. And the smoke has cleared. When the rest are gone. I'll be standing here. I will drive you home. I want you to know that. I will drive you home. Let 'em rev their engines. Let 'em spin their wheels. All they got is shine. They're just chrome and steel. When they raise the flag. And the smoke has cleared. When the rest are gone. I'll be standing here. Let 'em rev their engines. Let 'em spin their wheels. All they got is shine.

i wish every day could be like christmas,"What time is it baby, is it that time again. When snow will be falling, friends will be calling. You know it's time when, there'll be carolers singing Silent Night. I love when they sing, the feeling it brings. It's warm as a fire is bright. Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys. And reindeer are heading our way. Yes, and Santa will come down the chimney above. There's one thing I wanted to say. I wish every day could be like Christmas. And if I could have one wish come true. I wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony. I wish every day could be like Christmas, I do. I saw a child sit with old Mr. Clause,. Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was. Now the old man grew cautious, on how he would say. That it's the greatest gift what you could give, every day. I wish every day could be like Christmas. And if I could have one wish come true. I wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony. I wish every day could be like Christmas, I do. Now the mistle-toe and the house aglow. All the world seems at ease tonight. And all that I ask when these precious moments pass. Is why can't every day be so bright. I wish every day could be like Christmas. And if I could have one wish come true. I wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony. I wish every day could be like Christmas, I do. Honest I do, yes I do now. Very merry Christmas"
i'd die for you,"If you could see inside my heart. Then you'd understand. I'd never mean to hurt you. Baby I'm not that kind of man. I might not say I'm sorry. Yeah, I might talk though sometimes. And I might forget the little things. Or keep you hanging on the line. In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet. Boy meets girl. and promises we can't forget. We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets. Into the fire we cry. Chorus:. I'd die for you. I'd cry for you. I'd do anything. I'd lie for you. You know it's true. Baby I'd die for you. I'd die for you. I'd cry for you. If it came right down to me and you. You know it's true, baby I'd die for you. I might not be a saviour. And I'll never be a king. I might not send you roses. Or buy you diamond rings. But if I could see inside you. Maybe I'd know just who we are. 'Cause our love is like a hunger. Without it we would starve. In a world..... Chorus"
i'll be there for you,"I guess this time you're really leaving. I heard your suitcase say goodbye. And as my broken heart lies bleeding. You say true love is suicide. You say you've cried a thousand rivers. And now you're swimming for the shore. You left me drowning in my tears. And you won't save me anymore. I'll pray to God to give me one more chance, girl. I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe I wanna be the air for you. I'll be there for you. I'd live and I'd die for you. I'll steal the sun from the sky for you. Words can't say what love can do. I'll be there for you. I know you know we've had some good times. Now they have their own hiding place. I can promise you tomorrow. But I can't buy back yesterday. And baby you know my hands are dirty. But I wanted to be your valentine. I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby. When you get drunk, I'll be the wine. I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe I wanna be the air for you. I'll be there for you. I'd live and I'd die for you. I'll steal the sun from the sky for you. Words can't say what love can do. I'll be there for you. And I wasn't there when you were happy. I wasn't there when you were down. I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby. I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out. I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe I wanna be the air for you. I'll be there for you. I'd live and I'd die for you. I'll steal the sun from the sky for you. Words can't say what love can do. I'll be there for. I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe I wanna be the air for you. I'll be there for you. I'd live and I'd die for you. I'll steal the sun from the sky for you. Words can't say what love can do. I'll be there for"

i'm with you,Look at this world. It's filled with worn out places. Forgotten places and nothing changes. Whatever happened. To that new day rising. We're just surviving when living is dying.

It's just because the words got in the way. I remember how it used to be. I was you and you were me. We were more than just the same. Now these shoes don't fit, my skin's too tight. When you want a kiss, I take a bite. Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights. Last night I drank enough to drown. Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health. Look, we both know how much i've let you down. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. If i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away. Janie don't you take your love to town. You deserve a shooter, a saint. Someone to give it to you straight. To find the soul throught flesh and bone. My life's a treasure, full of sunny weather. But it's left me feeling cold. Now all you want to do is take me home. I hated you, the night you said you loved me. I hated you, 'cause I couldn't love myself. I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me. I got one foot in, one foot off the ground. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. If i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away. Janie don't you take your love to town. Sitting here while you're fast asleep. In the bathroom by the sink. Trying to write the right words down. I turn out the lights, close my eyes. There ain't no prayers or kiss goodnight. What i'll forget to say tomorrow, i'll say now. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. Janie don't you take your love to town. If i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away. Janie don't you take your love to town"
joey,"Joey Keys was from my neighborhood. Some would say that he was bad and Joe thought that was good. Joey got the name ""Keys"" picking locks. He never really robbed no one; it sure amused the cops. Joey's parents owned a restaurant. After closing time they'd give us almost anything we'd want. I never cared that Joey Keys was slow. Though he couldn't read or write too well but we'd talk all night long.. Come on, come on, come on. What you gonna do with your life?. Come on, come on, come on. Chasing sparks in the nights. His old man said tomorrow is a ride that goes nowhere. But I'll pull some strings, get blackbird wings. And break us out of there. [Chorus:]. Hey Joey. C'mon tell me 'bout your dreams. Tell me all the sights you're gonna see. Tell me who you're gonna be. Hey Joey. You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight. Sometimes you got to stand and fight. It'll be alright. We're gonna find a better life. See Joe was 3 years younger to the day. Acting like a little brother but became my ball and chain. I met this girl named Rhonda, she fell for me. She said, ""I might learn to like him but love ain't built for three."". [Chorus:]. Hey Joey. C'mon tell me 'bout your dreams. Tell me all the sights you're gonna see. Tell me who you're gonna be. Hey Joey. You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight. Sometimes you got to stand and fight. It'll be alright. Hey Joey. News gets around in this fading neighborhood. The old man lost the restaurant. He drinks more than he should. It's time for Joey keys to do some good. Pick the lock off our lives, let's get out of here like we always said we would. [Chorus:]. Hey Joey. C'mon tell me 'bout your dreams. Tell me all the sights you're gonna see. Tell me who you're gonna be. Hey Joey. You're gonna kiss the girls goodnight. Sometimes you got to stand and fight. It'll be alright. We're gonna find a better life. Find a better life. Find a better life"

justice in the barrel,Hey mister can you help me. I'm a loner on the run. I'm just looking for tomorrow. And I ain't gonna hurt no one. I jumped headfirst into a bottle. I was looking for a friend. Came up just short of nothing. I didn't find the truth I only found an end. So tell me who's gonna save me. Or my father or my son. When the only justice a man can see. Is the barrel... of a loaded gun. I been broke and I've been hungry. I think they're both my middle name. But I don't never ever never seem to get enough. Still guess I can't complain. 'Cause what you get in life you take it. You've gotta hold on and make it last. They say good things come to those who wait. But it's life that goes so fast. And when there's just one rule you live by. Each day you kiss the rising sun. When you live and die by the life we breathe. In the barrel of a loaded gun. Guns talk to me in my sleep at night. And a gun somewhere is burning. With my name. Winners are losers. And losers will have to face. All those yesterdays. And all of the dreams they blew away. So Mister can you help me. Or are you my gun. Have the ghosts of justice. Brought you here to me to taste. The barrel of a loaded gun. There's justice in the barrel. Of a loaded gun.

I must admit that I was reeling. Now I'm feeling just fine. Traded nightmares for dreaming. Go tell your shadows. That I got out alive. I ain't living with the ghost. No future living in the past. I've seen what hate has done to hope. I found the tree I cut the rope. Tomorrow wasn't built to last. I ain't living with the ghost. How can I scream I'm scared to breathe. I wrote each word you gave the. Toast. But we were fire and gasoline. I ain't living with the ghost. Last night I had this dream. I saw a man wash his feet. In the church holy water. He worked up to his knees. From his arms to his neck. Said I'm over my head. He was crying trying to get some relief. Lord, I'm just trying to get some relief. I had this dream. That man was me. I ain't living with the ghost. No future living in the past. I've seen what hate has done to hope. I found the tree I cut the rope. Tomorrow wasn't built to last. I ain't living with the ghost.

Like a friend that always stands by me. Memphis knows me. Never showed me. How did life just had to be. I couldn't even try to run away, say goodbye. Here I was born and here is where I'll die. I'm just a man from Tennessee. I can't be what I can't be. All I know is Memphis lives in me. I said I'm just a man from Tennessee. Can't be what I can't be. All I know is Memphis lives. All I know is Memphis gives. All I know is Memphis lives in me"
midnight in chelsea,"The kids 'round here look just like sticks. They trade old licks with a beat up six. I just smile and catch the groove. Gothic girls all dress in black. Serious as heart attacks. It takes a little bit of getting used to. The old man with the whiskey stains. Lost the night forgot his name. His poor wife will sleep alone again. And it ain't hard to understand. Why she's holding on to her own hand. Refrão:. It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea. No one's asking me for favors. No one's looking for a savior. They're too busy saving me. I've seen a lone,sloane ranger drive. seems her chauffeur took a dive. And sold her secrets to the sun. And later in a magazine. I finally figured what it means. To be a saint, not a queen. Two lustful lovers catch a spark. And chase their shadows in the dark. Someone's getting off tonight. Of a big red bus that's packed so tight. It disappears in a trail of light. Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right.... It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea. No one's asking me for favors. No one's looking for a savoir. They're too busy saving me. Midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea. No one's pinned dreams on me. No one's asking me to bleed. I'm the man I want to be. When Chelsea girls sing.... It's morning when I go to sleep. In the distant dawn a church bell rings. Another day is coming on. A baby's born, an old man dies. Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye. I leave my soul and just move on. And wish that I was there to sing this song. Refrão. It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea. No one's pinned dreams on me. No one's asking me to bleed. I'm the man I want to be. The man I want to be,the man I want to be. Midnight in Chelsea"
miracle,"A penny for your thoughts now baby. Looks like the weight of the world's. On your shoulders now. I know you think you're going crazy. Just when it seems everything's. Gonna work itself out. They drive you right back down. And you said it ain't fair. That a man walks. When a bird can fly. We have to kick the ground. The stars kiss the sky. They say that spirits live. A man has to die. They promised us truth. Now they're giving us lies. Gonna take a miracle to save us this time. And your savior has just left town. Gonna need a miracle. 'Cause it's all on the line. And I won't let you down. (No I won't let you down). The river of your hope is flooding. And I know the dam is busted. If you need me I'll come running. I won't let you down... no, no. You're looking for salvation. You thought that it'd be shining. Like an angel's light. Well, the angels left this nation. And salvation caught the last train. Out tonight. He lost one hell of a fight. He said. I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be. I never can be everything you wanted from me. I've got plans so big. That any blind man could see. I'm standing in the river. Now I'm drowning in the sea. Gonna take a miracle to save us this time. And your savior has just left town. Gonna need a miracle. 'Cause your heart's on the line. And your heartbeat is slowing down. Your feet are grounded still. You're reaching for the sky. You can let 'em clip your wings. 'Cause I believe that you can fly. Solo. Well my eyes have seen the horror. Of the coming of the flood. I've driven deep the thorny crown. Into the soul of someone's son. Still I'll look you in the eye. 'Cause I've believed in things I've thought. And I'll die without regret. For the wars I have fought. Gonna take a miracle to save you this time. And your savior has just left town. Gonna need a miracle. 'Cause your heart's doing time. And your conscience is calling you out. It ain't all for nothing. Life ain't written in the sand. I know the tide is coming. But it's time we made a stand. With a miracle"

misunderstood,"Should I? Could I?. Have said the wrong things right a thousand times. If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind. If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine. You cried, I died. I should have shut my mouth, things headed south. As the words slipped off my tongue,. They sounded dumb. If this old heart could talk,. It'd say you're the one. I'm wasting time when I think about it. [Chorus:]. I should have drove all night,. I would have run all the lights. I was misunderstood. I stumbled like my words, Did the best I could. Damn, misunderstood. Could I? Should I?. Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night. Staying out too late with all my friends. You found me passed out in the yard again. You cried, I tried. To stretch the truth, but didn't lie. It's not so bad when you think about it. [Chorus:]. I should have drove all night,. I would have run all the lights. I was misunderstood. I stumbled like my words, did the best I could. I 'm hanging outside your door. I've been here before. Misunderstood. I stumbled like my words, did the best I could. Damn, misunderstood. Intentions good. It's you and I, just think about it.... [Chorus:]. I should have drove all night. I would have run all the lights. I was misunderstood.

more than we bargained for,"I've always wanted what I couldn't have. I hope and dream that maybe someday. That I'd find out what love was all about. I sure grew up tonight the hard way. Now the candy store's closed, the movie's sold out. High Plains Drifter isn't what it's all about. And now we're parting ways, I won't say a word. Let our broken hearts cry in their graves. Where they'll never be heard. It's more than we bargained for. Our love is the price we've paid. And just like a fading dream..... It's slippin' away. Last night I saw you out with my best friend. When I'm with you I see him in your eyes. I want to hold you but I don't understand. There's something there that's so hard to disguise. Now tears run down your face, as you walk through the night. Those cold empty streets leave you wondering what's right. As you walk away with your broken heart. Don't you try to deny that true love had torn you apart. More than we bargained for. Our love is the price we've paid. And just like a fading dream..... It's slippin' away. It's more than we bargained for. It's more than we bargained for. More than we bargained for. Our love is the price weve paid. And just like a fading dream..... It's slippin' away. More than we bargained for. Our love is the price weve paid. And just like a fading dream.....

my guitar lies bleeding in my arms,"Misery likes company, I like the way that sounds. I've been trying to find the meaning, so I can write it down. Staring out the window, it's such a long way down. I'd like to jump, but I'm afraid to hit the ground. I can't write a love song the way I feel today. I can't sing no song of hope, I got nothing to say. Life is feeling kind of strange, since you went away. I sing this song to wherever you are,. As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms. I'm tired of watching Tv, it makes me want to scream. Outside the world is burning, man it's so hard to believe. Each day you know you're dying from the cradle to the grave. I get so numb sometimes, that I can't feel the pain. I can't write a love song the way I feel today. I can't sing no song of hope, I got nothing to say. Life is feeling kind of strange, since you went away. I sing this song to wherever you are,.

But here is my delusion, I don't know what to say. I can't write a love song the way I feel today. I can't sing no song of hope, I got nothing to say. And I can't fight the feelings, that are burning in my veins. I send this song to wherever you are,. As my guitar lies bleeding. I can't write a love song the way I feel today. I can't sing no song of hope, There's no one left to save. And I can't fight the feelings, buried in my brains. I send this song to wherever you are,. As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms.

mystery train,There are days when she's a whisper. Nights when she's a scream. A reason to wake up in the morning. To close your eyes and dream. She'll curse you like a sailor. She'll wound you with her eyes. She’ll always make it better. But won't apologize. You know everything about her but don't know her at all. Chorus:. She's a ride on a mystery train. To a place you've never been before. Better hold on tight to that mystery train. You're not in Kansas anymore. She's a ride. Mystery train. She cries because she's happy.

naked,"My friend had a girlfriend. She liked her drink. Sucked the head off her lager. Threw me a wink. And she said to me ""Buddy, what's your sign?"". I was off I was runnin'. Knocked me clean off my feet. Her tongue kept on selling. What any blind man could see. I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs. She said ""What you hiding underneath that shirt?"". Right behind the buttons there's a heart that hurts. Adam's evening left the curse. Take it off make it work. Naked - Naked - Just get back to basics. Naked - Face it - You can't fake it when you're naked. Naked - Face it. All I'm saying. The tail you been chasing. Put the K back in kink. Threw a coin in her jukebox. I started to think.

never say die,"As we stood there older than men. And younger than the boys (that's right). We were as still as the wind. That blows on a hot August night. And you were lonesome. As a jukebox. But deadly just the same. I could be as gentle as a newborn. Then spit into the eye of a hurricane. And we knew how to laugh. And we knew how to cry. Yeah, we sure knew how to live. But we don't ever. Never say die. Never say die. I guess you'd say we had a pact. These words we knew so well (that's right). Still they remained unspoken. And we'd take them to the fiery. Gates of hell. Once I was afraid of love. But when it's your brother. Those things change. 'Cause love is just another word. For trust. So hear me when I say. Never say die. Never say no. You got to look them in the eye. And don't let go. When it's your own blood you'll bleed. And your own tears you'll cry. When you're brought up to believe. That it's the strong who survive. Never say die. Solo. Yeah, and we could run like lightning. Through the pouring rain. And we'll be standing like a soldier. Who comes marching home again. They ask what it is that I want written. On the gravestone where I'll lie. Tell them it's just my bones. That died there. So save the tears they'll cry. My spirit is still riding somewhere. Somewhere in this night. When it's these three words that come to me. As I kiss this world goodbye. Never say die. Never say no. You got to look them in the eye. And don't let go. When it's your own blood you'll bleed. And your own tears you'll cry. When you're brought up to believe. That it's the strong who survive. Never say die."
never say goodbye,"As I sit in this smokey room. The night about to end. I pass my time as a stranger. But this bottle´s my only friend. Remember when we used to park. On Butler Street out in the dark. Remember when we lost the keys. And you lost more than that in my backseat. Remember how we used to talk. About busting out - we´d break their hearts. Together - forever. Chorus:. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. You and me and my old friends. Hoping it would never end. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. Holdin' on - we got to try. Holdin' on to never say goodbye. Remember days of skipping school. Racing cars and being cool. With a six pack and the radio. We didn't need no place to go. Remember at the prom that night. You and me we had a fight. But the band they played our favorite song. And I held you in my arms so strong. We danced so close. We danced so slow. And I swore I'd never let you go. Together - forever. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. You and me and my old friends. Hoping it would never end. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye. Holdin' on - we got to try. Holdin' on to never say goodbye. Solo. I guess you'd say we used to talk. About busting out. We'd break their hearts. Together - forever. Never say goodbye, never say goodbye.

Tried to sell my muscle car (that's not OK). You're mother's gonna visit for a couple months this year. They say you do the crime, you do the time. It's all so clear. I tell my self I (feel no pain).

Though the miles and the smiles roll on, they won't fade away. And it hurts just like hell to let go, but I know. Kings will be kings with crowns to defend. But I'm just one man and I can't pretend. A heart's just a heart and songs have to end. Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends. Now and forever, now and forever. I still remember when you didn't know my name.. We were lost on the road but you made it my home just the same,. God I wanna say that you gotta hold on when we go our separate ways. But when your radio's on, you're hearing this song. I hope that you say nothing's changed. Kings will be kings with crowns to defend. But I'm just one man and I can't pretend. A heart's just a heart and songs have to end.

real life,I wish that life was like it is in the movies. 'Cause the hero always gets his way. No matter how hard it gets on that dark lonely road. At the end he´s got a smile on his face. But when they threw me out to the lions. Noone saved me as I fell from your grace. And noone wrote me new lines. For what I said wrong. What I did wrong I could not erase. This is real life. This is real love. This is real pain. That much I'm sure of. These are real tears. These are real fears inside. That I can't hide. I wish that I could be a white knight in armour. With an army just to bring you back home. But I'll admit I'm scared of dialing your number. Someone else is gonna answer the phone. Why can't it be like it is on TV. When the orchestra plays and you come back to me. This is real life. This is real love. This is real pain. That much I'm sure of. These are real tears. These are real fears inside. I can't hide. This is real life. This is real love. These are real wounds I'm bleeding from. And I realize this is real. I always thought that our love. Was a story book tale. God knows that I'd never dream. In the end it could fail. 'Cause this is real life. This is real love. This is real pain. That much I'm sure of. These are real tears. These are real fears inside. That I can't hide. This is real life. This is real love. These are real wounds I´m bleeding from. And I realize this is real.
real love,"They're putting up the chairs to close. She let me settle up my tab. I told her button up your coat it's cold. I ain't too drunk to hail us a cab. We can get a cup of coffee. Unless you got to get back home. Sitting across the table. A gypsy couldn't read her mind. I took her hand and told her. I just want to crawl into her eyes. She shook her head and said it's cruel. Cool is just a cheap disguise. Have you ever known a real love?. The kind of love that makes you feel, love?. No, this ain't let's make a deal, love. Make an angel give his wings up. It makes you guilty 'cause you want more. If it's a kiss that you would die for. Feels like you're falling through the stars. If it can break your heart. It's real love. We drank that muddy pot of coffee. It was morning when I walked her home. I never been this lonely. Lying in this bed alone. Her words still ringing in my head. Her sad eyes sunk me like a stone. Have you ever known a real love?. The kind of love that makes you feel, love?. No, this ain't let's make a deal, love. Make an angel give his wings up. It makes you guilty 'cause you want more. If it's a kiss that you would die for. Feels like you're falling through the stars. If it can break your heart. It's real love. I put on the same shirt. And I ran out the door. Stole a fistful of roses from the sidewalk store. Just my heart in my hands. I had nothing to throw. Standing up on her front step. Calling to her window. Have you ever known a real love?. The kind of love that makes you feel, love?. No, this ain't let's make a deal, love. Make an angel give his wings up. It makes you guilty 'cause you want more. If it's a kiss that you would die for. Feels like you're falling through the stars. If it can break your heart. It's real love. Feels like you're falling through the stars. If it can break your heart. It's real love"

scars on this guitar,"Another Friday night I'm somewhere. A little drunk and worn out from the show. It's a hallway to a hotel room. The truck's already rolling down the road. I find the lights, take off my coat. I see her there just lying on the bed. She's seen me through my yesterdays. God knows tonight I'm needing her again. She's the place I go. When there's nowhere left to run to. She's the one I hold. When there's no one to hold on to. She's been with me late at night. When I was drowning in the dark. She heard my every word. When I was pouring out my heart. So I thank my lucky stars. For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar. She's given me her best. When I am at my worst. When I can't find the pieces. Fingers scratching in the dirt. She offers no forgiveness. ''Cause she likes to make it hurt. She's the place I go. When there's nowhere left to run to. She's the one I hold. When there's no one to hold on to. She's been with me late at night. When I was drowning in the dark. She heard my every word. When I was pouring out my heart. So I thank my lucky stars. For every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar. Morning like a freight train. Last night still ringing in my head. Before today becomes tomorrow. Tonight I know I'll do it all again. She's the place I go. When there's nowhere left to run to. She's the one I hold. When there's no one to hold on to. She's been with me late at night. When I was drowning in the dark.

Maybe say that you'll save me ... a seat next to you. In the corner booth of a downtown bar, with your head on my shoulder. Smokin' on a cheap cigar...that would be alright with me. In the back row of a movie or a cross-town train. I wanna hear your voice whispering my name...that's where I wanna be. Hard days, good times, blue skies, dark nights. Baby, say that you'll take me ... wherever you're going to. Maybe say that you'll save me ... a seat next to you. Life is like a ferris wheel, spinnin' around. When you get to the top it's hard to look down. Just hang on ... we'll make it through. Save me ... a seat next to you. When you get to the gates and the angels sing. Go to that place where the church bells ring. You know I'll come runnin' ... runnin' to find you. Baby, say that you'll take me ... wherever you're going to. Maybe I want you to save me ... a seat next to you. A seat next to you. A seat ... next to you"
secret dreams,"Riding high, then shot down. I load my guns to fire another round. I look deep into your eyes. And can't run there's nowhere left to hide.. Don't stop, no it's much too late.

she's a mystery,She won't let me buy her jewelry. She don't want things that she can keep. She wears wild flowers in her hair. Then throws them to the sea. She's the beginning and the end of me but. Chorus:. She's a mystery. My most beautiful regret. I will never understand her. She's a mystery. I still don't know what to call her. She says that words don't mean a thing. She changes her name every day. And lies all the time. I feel lucky to call her mine. Chorus:. She's a mystery. My most beautiful regret. I will never understand her. She's a mystery. The only promise I can keep. Even in my dreams she ruins me. She's anything in the world. That you cannot explain. But when she throws me a smile. It's like fire in the rain but. Chorus:.

shot through the heart,"Would you be content to see me crying. After all those little games you put me through. After all I've done for you you're lying. Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth. Didn't somebody somewhere say. You're gonna take a fall. I gave you everything. Now here's the curtain call. (Chorus). Shot through the heart as I lay there alone. In the dark through the heart. It's all part of this game that we call love. Now you've come back here to say you're sorry. But I don't know who you're talking to. It could be the man I used to be, girl.

shut up and kiss me,"I don't wanna talk about it. Baby wanna talk all night. You're on your feet six days a week. We're working nights just trying to make ends meet.

I don't wanna watch the TV. Wash the dishes now or pay the bills. Don't wanna eat, don't need to sleep. The only real meal that gives me a thrill. Don't need no candles, you're the spark.

silent night,"After the smoke clears. When it's down to you and I. When the sun appears. And there's nothing left but goodbyes. We'll just turn and walk away. How could we let it end like this. Just turn and walk away. Should we seal it with a kiss. It's too late. Now you're out and on the run. It's too late. Held up in love without a gun. Silent night. We hold up our candle light. Silent night. The night our love died, no words to say. And we're both too tired to fight. Just hold me close and don't let go.... It was all so simple when. You were to be queen and I'd be your king.. I guess those dreams got lost. Cause baby you're still you and I'm still me.. Now letting go. It's always the hardest part to fight. When we both know. We're just two more victims of the night. It's too late. Too late to wonder why. Much too late. To save a love that's died.. Silent night. We hold up our candle light. Silent night. The night our love died, no words to say. Now we're both too tired to fight. Just hold me close and don't let go. Just hold me close and don't let me go. After the smoke cleared. It was down to you and I. When the sun appeared. There was nothing left but goodbyes.... Silent night."
social disease,"You can read it in the papers. In some places it comes in thirty-two flavors. But you wouldn't tell no one. Your favorite if you could. From the White House to the alleys. From the President down to Long Tall Sally. Can't live with it but you'll die without it. Yes you would. Senorita's in the kitchen. She's a fistful of dynamite. You call 911 but you can't stop the fun tonight, it's alright. You can't start a fire without a spark. But there's something that I guarantee. You can't hide when infection starts. Because love is a social disease. Where you look you can find it. Try to run but you're always behind it. So you play hide and seek like a blind kid. Till you're caught, yeah you're caught. So you'll say that you had some. But they took it and held it for ransom. Were they tall, dark, skinny or handsome. You won't talk. So you telephone your doctor. Just to see what pill to take. You know there's no prescription. Gonna wipe this one away. You can't start a fire without a spark. But there's something that I guarantee. You can't hide when infection starts. Because love is a social disease. So full of high grade octane. She could run the bullet train on 38 double d's. Now you know for sure, you know the cure. To make a blind man see."

someday just might be tonight,"Playing king of the mountain on a dead end street. At the end of the block is where we cut our teeth. The world was trying to sweep up off our feet. I'd run home crying with cut up knees. ""Alright,"" Mama said. ""It's alright."". Now nothing's and it never will. When you learn to swallow defeat like a bitter pill. Remember the story about Jack 'n' Jill. They ended up driving in a Coupe de Ville. You don't know when your ship will arrive. Chorus:. Don't give up, don't give in. Stand and fight, you just might win. When the ride gets rough. Hold on tight. Someday just might be tonight. You're the kind that goes swimming with a raincoat on. Who's to say if you are right or wrong. Let me know when you figured it out. Just don't go drowning in a shadow of doubt. Don't let the bastards make up your mind. Chorus:. Don't give up, don't give in. Stand and fight, you just might win. When the ride gets rough. Hold on tight. Someday just might be tonight. You may never find a treasure that's been washed up on the beach. Heaven won't be waiting for you walking down these city streets. Remember Mama's Band Aids on your scabby knees. They had to bleed for little victories. Chorus:. Don't give up, don't give in. Stand and fight, you just might win. When the ride gets rough. Hold on tight. Someday just might be tonight. Don't give up, don't give in. You never know when the ship will come in. When the ride gets rough. Hold on tight"

something to believe in,"I lost all faith in my God, in his religion too. I told the angels they could sing their songs. to someone new.

staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand,"Staring At Your Window With A Suitcase In My Hand. You think you know me just because you know my name. You think you see me 'cause you've seen every line of my face. You want to want me just because I say that I want you. But does it matter if anything I'm saying is the truth. You need somebody, somebody to hold on to. But this ain't the movies and we ain't the heroes. Staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand. The streetlights buzz as the cars roll by. And the moon don't give a damn. My boots just keep on walkin', but my heart don't understand. Why I'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand. I say I want you, but when we woke up one of us was crying. You rolled over and all you said was 'Man I think I'm dying'. Our song is over, the band of gold has been feeling like a nose. You place your bets, 'cause no one thinks they'll lose. Staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand. The streetlights buzz as the cars roll by. And the moon don't give a damn. My boots just keep on walkin', but my heart don't understand. Why I'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand. The light of love can blind you 'til it covers up your eyes. And you try to find the reason not to say goodbye. It's the curse of every sailor standing on dry land. Staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand. The night is fading, like my old tattoo. A heart and a dagger, that says 'Forever'. Staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand. The streetlights buzz as the cars roll by. And the moon don't give a damn. I'm gettin' tired of talking, and I don't understand. Why I'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand"

No I, am not, a writer. These eyes hold no secrets I hide no truths. I am that I am all I was to you. The lie and the promise. The great escape artist. The weed in your garden. In that place you're still guarding. Where I am not a liar. I am the fighter. Though not a boxer by trade. I am the fighter. Few will remember my name. These are hands that can offer protection. But hid me from my own reflection. I'm the book that ain't finished. The sink full of dishes. A horse that ain't winning. That priest that's still sinning. That spark that starts the fire. I am the fighter. Though not a boxer by trade. I am the fighter. Few will remember my name. With loneliness next to me. Fear sits in misery. Nursing another black eye. On the New Jersey turnpike. I'm counting the headlights. As cars just like days pass me by. I am the fighter. Though not a boxer by trade. I am the fighter. Few will remember my name. I am the fighter. Though not a boxer by trade. I am the fighter. A fighter is born but not made. I should write down these words before I lose them. Or write you a song just to use them"

the last night,"These days, its hard to have a heart. It doesn't matter where you come from, or who you think you are. These days, it's hard just fitting in. Why does someone have to lose, for someone else to win. We're all looking for forgiveness, and someone we can trust. You can wrap your arms around the world. It all comes down to us.

I'll be the shoulder you can lean on, when everybody's gone. This is the last night, you'll have to be alone. I know, you, heard it all before. There's nothing worst than living less. When you yearn for something more. Makes no sense, its hard to understand. When there's something that should fill you up. Keeps slipping through your hands. We're all looking for answers. We're all down here on our knees. All anybody really wants, is something to believe. Enough is enough, I can't take any more. But I'm standing on your front porch. Kicking down your door. This is the last night. This is the last night"

the one that got away,"If I, I could be anyone. Could I, I be your only one?. If I, I could be anything. Could I be the secret that you keep. Breath that you breathe. Your dreams while you sleep?. If you, if you could read my mind. Then you, you'd now I crossed that line. I, I'd make you my Valentine. I can't let you go but I know. That this ring is there to remind. Chorus:. So let's re-enact that scene. From what's-his-name's one act play. I'll be your hero. And you'll be the one who got away. Now I'm chasing headlights back home. And you, you're sitting there on your own. When we were sippin' martinis. I started believing I wouldn't be leaving alone. I told you a joke and you laughed. When I asked you to dance. You said there's no band, there's no radio. I got up real slow, started singing real low. When I was melting in your arms I had to let go. Chorus:. So let's re-enact that scene. From what's-his-name's one act play. I'll be your hero. And you'll be the one... If there was no tomorrow. There were no yesterdays. The stolen moments we've borrowed. We wouldn't let slip away.

the price of love,"One Heart one other. They met last summer. One move she started. Now they love this way. The pain of pleasure. lying together. You're at their mercy. As the telephone's ringing on. No one said there'd be nights like this. Risk your life for a stolen kiss. We live , we learn, we lie. For the price of love. We kiss then say goodbye. For the price of love. Each move goes so slow. Until the doors close. No secret codes now. No words as baby goes down. One last dance then goodbye. Practicing his love lies. He runs to his wife. And your left holding the knife. You live your life to take that chance. When you're a master of. The art of romance. And you know you won't cross. that line. Until that last slow dance. We live, we learn, we lie. For the price of love. We kiss, then say goodbye. For the price of love. We live, we learn, we lie. For the price of love. Alone our lonely hearts. Would die.. It's all a game. And the way that it's played. There's no time to wonder why. To catch you when you fall. Answer when you call. No one can hear you cry. Solo. We live, we learn, we lie. For the price of love. We kiss, then say goodbye. For the price of love"
the promise,"(Slippery when wet demo). I can see the sun goin' down. I still see the cars roll by. I can see that seaside pool. Where we spent those summer nights. And I can hear the moonlit ocean. And I can feel your hand in mine. I can taste the warm free ocean. What a vision in my mind. And I, I lie in waiting. And I'm anticipating the promise, the promise. I remember what you told me. We both sounded so sincere. You said you'd always be my baby. And I said baby I'll always be there. Well I remember our first time girl. I still see the beach that night. I remember we were scared girl. But we both know that it felt so right. Time can never change it. And I'll never break it. The promise, the promise. Was made for nights like this. Seal it with your kiss. The promise, with the promise. Now the summer sun is gone. For the young ones who are left to carry on. The promise, the promise"
the radio saved my life tonight,"Album: 100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong. I got something on my mind; I’m just a little bit depressed. I try to blame it on the rain but it was in my heart, I guess. I’m feeling like a stranger when I drove through my hometown. Past the sign that reads ‘The Boyhood Home of a Place That’s Long Gone Now’. I realized ain’t nothing what it used to be. Until I heard a song that takes me to my memories. Chorus:. Radio saved my life tonight. An old song that that DJ played made me feel alright. I made it home by my dashboard light. The radio saved my life tonight. Just this side of morning, just this side of dawn. I walked so soft into my bedroom, saw my wife sleeping alone. She whispered, “Baby, are you OK? Have you been gone for long?”. I just kicked off my jeans and I held her close, I held her all night long. I tried to sleep but in my mind I heard that song. Like a friend in need the melody keeps me hanging on. Chorus:. Radio saved my life tonight. An old song that that DJ played made me feel alright. I made it home by my dashboard light. Radio saved my life tonight. Chorus:. The radio saved my life tonight. The sad song that the DJ played made me feel alright. As I drove down that lonesome highway just me and my dashboard light. Radio saved my life tonight. Radio saved my life tonight. That old song that the DJ played made me feel alright. I made it home by my dashboard light. Radio saved my life tonight. The radio saved my life tonight. The radio saved my life tonight. The radio saved my life tonight. The radio saved my life tonight"

Another car out on the street. Trying to find the highway. Hey, are you going my way?. This is the story of my life. And I write it everyday. I know it isn't black and white. And it's anything but gray. I know that no, I'm not alright. But I'll be OK ‘cause. Anything can, everything can happen. That's the story of my life. I'm gonna write the melody.

Wonder who you're with. Remember I swore love that night. You sealed it with your kiss. My heart it beats but I'm not alive. Took a part of me when you said goodbye. I'll take the right side. Love on the wrong side. There ain't no right side. Love on the wrong side. Daddy says were from different worlds. Boys like me don't date daddy's girl. ?????. If you build you a wall it can lock you in. You say that I lose, hope that I win. I'll have my chance. ?????. My heart it beats but I'm not alive. Took a part of me when you said goodbye.

Guess that makes two - me and you. By the way, my name's Jones. I know a place not far from here. That's my dented red Chevy out front. You can follow me there. Chorus:. There's no neon lights.

these days,"I was walking around, just a face in the crowd. Trying to keep myself out of the rain. Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown. Wondered if I might end up the same. There's a man out on the corner, singing old songs about change. Everybody got their cross to bare, these days. She came looking for some shelter with a suitcase full of dreams. To a motel room on the boulevard. I guess she's trying to be James Dean. She's seen all the disciples and all the wanna be's. No one wants to be themselves these days. Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days. These days - the stars seem out of reach. These days - there ain't a ladder on the streets. These days - are fast, nothing last in this graceless age. There ain't anybody left but us these days. Jimmy shoes busted both his legs, trying to learn to fly. From a second story window, he just jumped and closed his eyes. His mamma said he was crazy - he said mamma ""I've got to try"". Don't you know that all my heroes died. And I guess I'd rather die than fade away. These days - the stars ain't out of reach. But these days - there ain't a ladder on the streets. These days - are fast, nothing lasts, it's a graceless age. Even innocence has caught the midnight train. And there ain't anybody left but us these days. I know Rome's still burning. Though the times have changed. This world keeps turning round and round and round and round. These days. These days - the stars ain't out of reach. These days - there ain't a ladder on the streets. These days - are fast, nothing lasts. There ain't no time to waste. There ain't anybody left to take the blame. And there ain't anybody left but us these days. There ain't anybody left but us these days"

Sometimes it get rough. Could have thrown the towel in. And thrown the hands up. Seems like we've always been. And always will be thick as thieves. Time, time won't never drag us down.

What's up bored to do, it's classic me and you. Lucky you, lucky me. Thick as thieves"

this ain't a love song,I should have seen it coming when the roses died. Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes. I should have listened when you said good night. You really meant good bye. Baby ain't it funny how you never ever learn to fall. You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall. But only fools are know-it-alls and I've played that fool for you. I cried and cried. There were nights that I died for you baby. I tried and I tried to deny it that your love drove me crazy baby. If the love that I got for you is gone. If the river I've cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. Baby I thought you and me would. Stand the test of time. Like we got away with the perfect crime. But we were just a legend in my mind. I guess that I was blind. Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade. The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade. You and I were the renegades some things never change. It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby. And now it's so sad that whatever we had. Ain't worth saving oh oh oh. If the love that I've got for you is gone. If the river I've cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yes I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. If the pain that I'm feeling so strong. Is the reason that I'm holding on. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. I cried and I cried. There were nights that I died for you baby. I tried and I tried to deny it that. Your love drove me crazy. If the love that I got for you is gone. If the river I cried ain't that long. Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong. This ain't a love song. If the pain that I'm feeling so strong.

till we ain't strangers anymore (feat. leann rimes),"It might be hard to be lovers,. But it's harder to be friends. Baby pull down the covers,. It's time you let me in. Maybe light a couple candles,. I'll just go ahead and lock the door. If you just talk to me baby,. Til we ain't strangers anymore.. Lay your head on my pillow,. I sit beside you on the bed. Don''t you think it's time we say. Some things we haven't said. Ain't too late to get back to that place. Back to the way we thought it was before. Why don't you look at me here,. Til we ain't strangers anymore.. Sometimes it's hard to love me,. Sometimes it's hard to love you too. I know it''s hard believing,. That love can pull us through. It would be so easy,. To live your life with one foot out the door. Just hold me baby,. Til we ain't strangers anymore.. It's hard to find forgivness. When we just run out of lies. It's hard to say you're sorry. When you can't tell wrong from right. It would be so easy. To spend your whole damn life. Just keeping score. So let's get down to it baby. There ain't no need to lie. Tell me who you think you see. When you look into my eyes. Let's put our two hearts back together. And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor. Make love with me baby. Til we ain't strangers anymore.. We're not strangers anymore. We're not strangers.

But I felt like a hired hand. Sometimes I have to find my way. Sometimes I have to get away. Take me back to Tokyo Road. Take me back to Tokyo Road. Working hard, for a pass. Got the night, make it last. It was a time to remember. All my life I would never forget. In a bar, breathing smoke. Snorting whiskey, drinking coke. It was a time when no one would die. And there wasn't a care. Sometimes I wish it was that way. Cause sometimes I have to get away. Take me back to Tokyo Road. Take me back to Tokyo Road. Take me back to Tokyo Road. Take me back to Tokyo Road. This guy turns me around and he's pointing up the stairs. I found myself in her doorway but there wasn't anybody there. She walked in the room with nothing on but a red light. And with a smile she got so close to me.. She whispered something 'bout midnight. You know I didn't understand a word she said. But it felt so good. She knew that I didn't have any money. But baby I knew she would.... Take me back to Tokyo Road. Take me back to Tokyo Road."

That's just one side of the story. In the two story town. Chorus. It's just the same old sights. And the same old sounds. I’m gonna take my car and drive out of this two story town. The same old ship is going ’round. I'm going down, down, down, down, down. In a two story town. There's a girl that I sleep with. Got ecstasy eyes. He promised her roses and American pies. I called her and my demons. I kissed them both goodbye. Chorus. One shot to make a move now. The ghosts are calling me out. And me I'm just one story. In a two story town. But you're never gonna find me in the lost and found. Chorus. Chorus 2:. It's just the same old sights and the same old sounds. I’m gonna take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round.

There was a tear in my old man's eye. When I was leaving. He tried to say goodbye. He says stand tall when you stumble. Stay proud when you're humble. The lessons you've learned, won't be the ones that you planned. Every step up that mountain. Will be more than what's counting. But when you walk through the valley. May you walk like a man. I've seen a couple of miles on a gravel road. You taught me a couple of things that I didn't know. Now, I even got a kid of my own. Starting to sound a lot like me. I learned a little thing called sacrifice. Givin' up on dreams lost a couple fights. All anybody wants is a better life. Something to believe. Stand tall when you stumble. Stay proud when you're humble. All the lessons you've learned, won't be the ones that you planned. Every step up that mountain. Will be more than what's counting. But when you walk through the valley. May you walk like a man. I couldn't believe it. And the tears came to my eyes. It isn't easy. Standing on the other side. I said sit down son, we gotta talk. Hey it's your life, you are gonna do what you wanna. I won't say crawl before you walk. Cause I heard my old man in my mind. He say. Stand tall when you stumble. Stay proud when you're humble. All the lessons you've learned, won't be the ones that you planned. Every step up that mountain. Will be more than what's counting. But when you walk through the valley. May you walk like a man.

when we were us,"We were young, unafraid. We were finding our own way. There is no wind, there is no rain. In the eye of the hurricane. Every time you climb that mountain. There's another one left to climb. Don't go looking for tomorrow. Leaving yesterday behind. Writing every page together. Those days were not to last forever. Diamonds in the rough. When we were us. Burn the house and torch the skyline. There was more than fire in my eyes. Love meant more than lust. When we were us. We were one, born and raised. More than blood runs through these veins. Cuts can heal, scars will fade. What we had will never change. Seasons pass and time will move on. You don't ever have to let it go. You can go only so far now. Till your on your way back home. Writing every page together. Those days were not to last forever. Diamonds in the rough. When we were us. Burn the house and torch the skyline. There was more than fire in my eyes. Love meant more than lust. When we were us. Memories are nothing more than ghost that we let in. Don't be afraid of them, do you remember when. Writing every page together. Those days were not to last forever. Diamonds in the rough. When we were us. Burn the house and torch the skyline. There was more than fire in my eyes. Love meant more than lust. When we were us.

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face. There isn't one of these lines that I would erase. I lived a million miles of memories on that road. With every step I take I know that I'm not alone. You take the home from the boy. But not the boy from his home. These are my streets, the only life I've ever known. Who says you can't go home.

If it's a million miles away or just ten miles up the road. Take it in , Take it with you when you go. Who says you can't go home?. . (fonte: site oficial)"

And I looked up on the screen. I saw a hundred pretty girls. Sing this song on MTV. Send me some silk stockings. Smooth talking lipstick and curls. I want a woman. More than a girl.

Shot through the heart and you're to blame. You give love a bad name. I play my part and you play your game. You give love a bad name. You give love a bad name. You paint your smile on your lips. Blood red nails on your fingertips. A school boy's dream, you act so shy. You very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye. You're a loaded gun. There's nowhere to run. No one can save me. The damage is done. Shot through the heart and you're to blame. You give love a bad name. I play my part and you play your game. You give love a bad name. You give love a bad name. Shot through the heart and you're to blame. You give love a bad name. I play my part and you play your game. You give love a bad name. You give love a bad name. Shot through the heart and you're to blame. You give love a bad name. I play my part and you play your game. You give love a bad name. You give love a bad name. You give love. You give love a bad name. You give love. You give love a bad name. You give love. You give love a bad name. You give love. You give love a bad name"
you had me from hello,"At the mirror you fix your hair and put your makeup on. You're insecure about what clothes to wear. I can't see nothing wrong. To me you look so beautiful when you can't make up your mind. It's half past eight, it's getting late. It's OK, take your time. Standing here my hands in my pockets. Like I have a thousand times. Thinking back it took one breath. One word to change my life. Chorus: The first time I saw you it felt like coming home. If I never told you I just want you to know. You had me from hello. When we walk into a crowded room it's like we're all alone. Everybody tries to kidnap your attention. You just smile and steal the show. You come to me and take my hand. We start dancin' slow. You put your lips up to my ear and whisper way down low. Chorus: From the first time I saw you it felt like coming home. If I never told you I just want you to know. You had me from hello. And when you're laying down beside me. I feel your heartbeat to remind me.... Chorus: The first time I saw you it felt like coming home. If I never told you I just want you to know. You had me from hello. From hello. From hello"
you really got me now,You're dancing with your shadow. You been talking in your sleep. Well you can walk on water. But don't want to wet your feet. You really got me. You really got me now. You know I don't know how you do it. But you really put me through it. You got me. You say you talk to everyone. Who is anyone in town. But they don't recognize you. With your foot out of your mouth. You really got me. You really got me now. You know I don't know how you do it. But you really put me through it. You got me. Who am I to judge a man. Who says he's his own biggest fan. It's true. You brought a knife out to a gunfight. And you're shouting that I'm dead. My old friends Smith and Wesson. Think you're in over your head. You really got me. You really got me now. You know I don't know how you do it. But you really put me through it. You got me. Repeat.
