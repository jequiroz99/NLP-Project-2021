Why don’t you tell me what that’s all about?. I’m not about your crying girl. Over all the lies, now the walls are falling down. Said all my goodbyes,. Tried too many times. Now I hope you see what you’ve done to me. No more love in this happy home. Say goodbye and just carry on. Write it down for the next one. So they will know. I watched the sun rise. Way too many times. Without you by my side. Because I can’t even lie. All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone…. Thought about how it could’ve been. Remembering the days we’ve shared. Looking back on all the memories. And when you acted like you cared. You took a second just to figure it out. And I can see the ran is falling down. And I’ve been stuck in the middle girl. You took too long for me to come around. Said all my goodbyes,. Tried too many times. Now I hope you see what you’ve done to me. No more love in this happy home. Say goodbye and just carry on.

mayberry,Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster. Than it did in the old days. So naturally we have more natural disasters. From the strain of a fast pace. Sunday was the day of rest. Now its one more day for progress. And we can't slow down. Cause more is best. It's all an endless process. Well I miss Mayberry. Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke. Where everything is black & white. Picking on a Six String. Where people pass by and you call them by their first name. Watching the clouds roll by. bye bye. Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting. Through the trees as the wind blows. Thats when I climb up here on this mountain. To look through God's window. Now I can't fly. But I've got two feet. To get me high up here. Above the noise and city streets. My worries disappear. Well I miss Mayberry. Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke. Where everything is black & white. Picking on a Six String. Where people pass by and you call them by their first name. Watching the clouds roll by. bye bye. Sometimes I dream I'm driving down an old dirt road. Not even listed on the map. I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole. But I always wake up everytime I try to turn back. Well I miss Mayberry. Sitting on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry Coke.
