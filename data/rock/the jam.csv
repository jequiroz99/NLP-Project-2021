I light up when you kiss me. And I know you're gonna treat me right. You give me fever. When you kiss me. Fever when you hold me tight. Fever through the daytime. I get a fever all through the night.

shopping,High town - high street connections. With clothes at the top of my list. You could steal things from the jewelry department. But you can't take kind or steal a kiss. As I flit from shop window to window. I'm trying to pick up a friendly bargin. But it's not like the adverts all make out. And there's no one to greet you as a friend. I dress myself for the part. I smile but it just don't work. Something about my face - must just be the wrong shape. I better try another brand pretty quick. I'm haunted by the colours and holding a reminder that I must be inadequate. High town - high street connection. With clothes at the top of my list.

tales from the riverbank,"Bring you a tale from the pastel fields. Where we ran when we were young. This is a tale from the water meadows. Trying to spread some hope into your heart. It's mixed with happiness - it's mixed with tears. Both life a death are carried in this stream. That open space you could run for miles. Now you don't get so many to the pound. True it's a dream mixed with nostalgia. But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to. That I'll always run to. Won't you join me by the riverbank. Paradise found down by the still waters. Joined in the race to the rainbow's end. No fears no worries just a golden country. Woke at sunrise, went home at sunset. Now life is so critical, life is too cynical. We lose our innocence, we lose our very soul. True it's a dream mixed with nostalgia. But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to. That I'll always run to. True it's a dream mixed with nostalgia.

Oh and by the way I must tell you, before I sign off. That I've got a meeting next week. With the head of a big corporate. I can't disclose who but I'm sure you'll know it and. And the burning sky - keeps burning bright. And it won't turn off til it's had enough. It's the greedy bastard who won't give up. And you're just a dreamer if you don't realize. And the sooner you do will be the better for you. Then we'll all be happy and we'll all be. Wise and all bow down to the burning sky. Then we'll all be happy and we'll all be wise.

At breakfast he is strapped in a chair (won't go far). Just a word out of place, he's sent to his room. Don't tell them you're sane. They'll laugh and put you to sleep. Don't tell them you're sane, but you are. Tell me what you did today, was it good. What was it like and who was it with. Don't think I'm prying I'd just like to know. Why it is you do things so slow. Take him to the doctor, see what he says."
down in the tube station at midnight,"The distant echo. Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains. To take them home to. The ones that they love. And who love them forever. The glazed, dirty steps. Repeat my own and reflect my thoughts. Cold and uninviting. Partially naked. Except for toffee wrapers. And this morning's paper. Mr. Jones got run down. Headlines of death and sorrow. They tell of tomorrow. Madmen on the rampage. And I'm down in the tube station at midnight. I fumble for change. And pull out the Queen. Smiling, beguiling. I put in the money. And pull out a plum. Behind me. Whispers in the shadows. Gruff blazing voices. Hating, waiting. ""Hey boy"" they shout. ""have you got any money?"". And I said - ""I've a little money. And a take away curry. I'm on my way home to my wife. She'll be lining up the cutlery,. You know she's expecting me. Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork. And I'm down in the tube station at midnight. I first felt a fist. And then a kick. I could now smell their breath. They smelt of pubs. And Wormwood Scrubs. And too many right wing meetings. My life swam around me. It took a look and drowned me. In its own existence. The smell of brown leather. It blended in with the weather. It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth. It blocked all my senses. Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer. And I'm down in the tube station at midnight. I said I was down. In the tube station at midnight. The last thing that I saw. As I lay there on the floor. Was ""Jesus Saves"". Painted by an atheist nutter. And a British Rail poster read. ""Have an Awayday. A cheap holiday. Do it today!"". I glanced back on my life. And thought about my wife. 'Cause they took the keys. And she'll think it's me. And I'm down in the tube station at midnight. The wine will be flat. And the curry's gone cold. I'm down in the tube station at midnight"
dream time,"Streets I ran - this whole town -. Backstreets and all - I wanted to leave there.. But no matter how fast I ran, my feet were glued, I just couldn't move. there.. I saw the hate and lots of people. I heard my name called above the noise. I tried to speak but my tongue was tied. Bumped into emptiness and started to cry - oh no. I saw the lights and the pretty girls. And I thought to myself what a pretty world,. But there's something else here that puts me off.. And I'm so scared dear, my love comes in frozen packs,. Bought in a supermarket.. Streets I ran, through wind and rain,. Around this place amongst streaming sunshine.. Scared I was, sweating now.. Feeling of doom, my bowels turned to water.. I felt hot breath whisper in my ear,. I looked for somewhere to hide but everywhere's closed.. I shut my eyes pretend not to be here,. This feeling's much to real to ever disappear - oh no.. I saw the lights and the pretty girls. And I thought to myself what a pretty world,. But there's something else here that puts me off.. And I'm so scared dear, their hate comes in frozen packs,. Bought in a supermarket.. And I'm so scared dear -."
dreams of children,"I sat alone with the dreams of children. Weeping willows and tall dark building,. I've caught a fashion from the dreams of children. But woke up sweating from this modern nightmare, and. I was alone, no one was there. I caught a glimpse from the dreams of children. I got a feeling of optimism. But woke up to a grey and lonely picture. The streets below left me feeling dirty, and. I was alone, no one was there. I was alone, no one was there. Something's gonna crack on your dreams tonight.... You will crack on your dreams tonight. I fell in love with the dreams of children. I saw a vision of all the happy days. I've caught a fashion from the dreams of children. But woke up sweating from this modern nightmare, and. I was alone, no one was there. I was alone, no one was there. Something's gonna crack on your dreams tonight.... You will crack on your dreams tonight."
english rose,"No matter where I roam. I will come back to my English rose. For no bonds can ever tempt me from she. I've sailed the seven seas,. Flown the whole blue sky.. But I've returned with haste to where my. Love does lie.. No matter where I go I will come back to my English Rose. For nothing can ever tempt me from she.. I've searched the secret mists -. I've climbed the highest peaks. Caught the wild wind home. To hear her soft voice speak. No matter where I roam. I will return to my English Rose. For no bonds can ever keep me from she.. I've been to ancient worlds. I've scoured the whole universe. And caught the first train home. To be at her side.. No matter where I roam. I will return to my English Rose."
fly,"The way that sunlight flits across your skirt,. makes me feel I'm from another world,. To touch your face in the morning light.. I hope you're always gonna be around.. The times I struggle to understand why,. The ancient proverbs like Who am I?. Why am I here and What have I done?. I see the answer's place my trust in you. Trust in you love, be with me then,. That's when I want you, that's when I need you the most.. I want us to be like Peter Pan. But dreams it seems are weightless as sand,. And man's supposedly is made of sand. It seems that man cannot survive at all. Let's disappear love, let's fly away. Into the demi-monde, into the twilight zone. The times inside I spent screaming at you. Release me please from this mortal jail. One shrug or smile can determine my fate,. I'm lost for days and have myself to blame. Something I'm giving, is yours for the taking,. Something like sunlight, Love is a spotlight. Love is all sorrow, still I'll meet you tomorrow."
funeral pyre,"Down in amongst the streets tonight. Books will burn, people laugh and cry in their turmoil. (turmoil turns rejoiceful). Shed your fears and lose your guilt. Tonight we burn responsibility in the fire. We'll watch the flames grow higher!. But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home. And as I was standing by the edge. I could see the faces of those led pissing theirselves laughing. (and the flames grew). Their mad eyes buldged their flushed faces said. The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger. We feast on flesh and drink on blood. Live by fear and dispise love in a crises. (what with today's high prices). Bring some paper and bring some wood. Bring what's left of all your love for the fire. We'll watch the flames grow higher!. But if you get too burnt - you can't come back home. And as I was standing by the edge. I could see the faces of those led pissing theirselves laughing. (and the flames grew). Their mad eyes buldged their flushed faces said. The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger. In the funeral pyre. We'll watch the flames grow higher. But if you get too burnt - you can't come back home. (well I feel so old, when I feel so young. well I just can't grow up to meet the demands)."

ghosts,"Why are you frightened - can't you see that it's you. That ain't no ghost - it's a reflection of you. Why do you turn away - an' keep it out of sight. Oh - don't live up to your given roles. There's more inside you that you won't show. But you keep it hidden just like everyone. You're scared to show you care - it'll make you vulnerable. So you wear that ghost around you for disguise. But there's no need just 'cos it's all we've known. There's more inside you that you haven't shown. So keep on moving, moving, moving your feet. Keep on shuf-shuf-shuffling to this ghost dance beat. Just keep on walking down never ending streets. One day you'll walk right out of this life. And then you'll wonder why you didn't try. To spread some loving all around. Old fashioned causes like that still stand. Gotta rid this prejudice that ties you down. How do you feel at the end of the day. Just like you've waked over your own grave. So why are you frightened - can't you see that it's you. At the moment there's nothing - so there's nothing to lose."
girl on the phone,Girl on the phone keeps a-ringing back. Her voice is smooth but the tone is bland. She's telling me this and she's telling me that. She talks about me and I must agree. With what she says about me. About how nice I can be. But it makes no difference to my mind. Girl on the phone keeps a-ringing back. She knows all my details - she's got my facts. She tells me my height and she knows my weight. She knows my age and says she's knows fate. And I must say - it's logical. What foresight she must have. I've got to meet her whenever I get time. Says she knows everything about me. Every word I've ever said. Every book I've ever read. She told me that we met along time ago. I can't think when but she should know. Girl on the phone keeps a-ringing back. Knows where I get my shirts and where I get my pants. Where I get my trousers where I get socks. My leg measurements and the size of my cock. And I must say it's un-nerving. To think that she knows me. Knows me so well - better than anyone. Better than myself. Says she knows everything about me. Every record I've listened to. Every window that I've looked through. She told me that we met along time ago. I can't think when but she should know. Girl on the phone keeps a-ringing back. She's telling me this and she's telling me that.
going underground,"Some people might say my life is in a rut,. But I'm quite happy with what I got. People might say that I should strive for more,. But I'm so happy I can't see the point.. Somethings happening here today. A show of strength with your boy's brigade and,. I'm so happy and you're so kind. You want more money - of course I don't mind.

Some people might get some pleasure out of hate. Me, I've enough already on my plate. People might need some tension to relax. [Me?] I'm too busy dodging between the flak. What you see is what you get. You've made your bed, you better lie in it. You choose your leaders and place your trust. As their lies wash you down and their promises rust. You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and. guns. And the public wants what the public gets. But I don't get what this society wants. I'm going underground, (going underground). Well the brass bands play and feet start to pound. Going underground, (going underground). [So] let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for. tomorrow. We talk and talk until my head explodes. I turn on the news and my body froze. The braying sheep on my TV screen. Make this boy shout, make this boy scream!"

It's like a heatwave burning in my heart. I can't keep from crying. Tearing me apart. Whenever she calls my name. Sounds so soft sweet and plain. Right then, right there. I feel this burning pain.

hey mister,"Because it's real you think it's a joke. Because it's on your doorstep you have to have a poke. At someone. It's only a cliche because it's all true. Time after time it happens through and through. To a new generation. You're just so smug in your elected seat. You've got your papers sorted out but you can't find your feet. Well, I'm not surprised. Hey mister with your head in the clouds. You can't see further than the shillings and pounds. The things that you say don't mean nothing anymore. You have no control they've broken down all the doors. And the only way that you'll fix them up. Is another war. If you think I'm gonna die in a financial war. You've got another thing coming and. And what's more there's lots like me. You juggle lives around with the stroke of a pen. But we've paid to see that move and now we won't pay again. The cost is too high. Hey mister your smiles been erased. You can't understand why we're losing face. Perhaps it's the promises that you never kept. ""Never had it so good""."
i got by in time,"Saw a girl that I used to know. I was deep in thought at the time. Don't recognise the face at first. 'Cause I was probably looking at mine. Well she was the only girl I've ever loved. But my folks didn't dig her so much. I was young. It was serious. To me she was the world (she was my world now). I thought I'd never live without her,. But I got by in time. Well let me tell you now,. Saw a guy that I used to know. Man he'd changed so much. I think it hurt him to say 'hello',. 'Cause he hardly opened his mouth. Yeah well he was my best friend a few years ago. Truly inseperable. We were young. and full of ideals. We were gonna rule this whole world. But something happened. I didn't know why. But that's the way that it goes.. I suppose,. What you say - what you do. Don't mean nothing, nothing at all. And all the bonds you make between ya. Can be broken any time you want now. Please tell me if my philosophy's wrong. I've got to know the truth. I don't mean to offend anyone but,. You know it's something that I do, oh-. So nice to see you tonight,. And I'm so glad that you came. Some of the people standing outside, say. Sure feel the same. Yeah my point is in a round about way. Given time he'll always forget. 'Cos the memories. That are shouting me on. To me everything (you're everything now). And it always will be mine, yeah."
i got you (i feel good),I feel good. I knew that I would now. So good. So good. I've got you. I feel nice. Like sugar and spice. So nice. So nice. I've got you. When I hold in my arms. I know that you do me no harm.
i need you (for someone),"I need you to keep me straight,. When the world don't seem so great,. And it's hard enough you know. I need you to be around. When my conscience brings me down. And the world feels so obscure. I want you to be the one. Who tells me off when I do wrong,. And you know I can be bad. I need you, I need you. Say you'll stay, make my day. Now what have I done,. Was it something I said - oh dear. I need you to turn me off,. When you think I've said enough,. To the extent of being a bore. I need you to tell me no. Slap my wrists and send me home. Tell me I can't come again. Now why are you crying -."
i've changed my address,"Knew the time to leave had come. When you pointed out your ring. Never could see what was in this matrimony thing. Baby, baby, baby you sure made a noise when I left. And your father started shouting. lest you ironed my shirts 'fore I left. Would've liked to explain first. But it was a split decision thing. Couldn't see me settling down with a mortgage and a kid. Now I hear you've been looking for me. Combing every single inch. You'll probably find me in hyde park. Try the hotel first then a bench. Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address. I didn't mean to make you cry but I know it's for the best. Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address. It's ok being in love girl, but then fun is second best. No one's gonna tie me down. Nobody tell me what to do. Don't you see I've got to be free. Sorry baby that's the way it is - get with me. I said maybe!. I didn't mean to break your heart. And I know it's not your choice. Better think of it this way, there's other fools to entice. That's right!. Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address. I didn't mean to make you cry but I know it's for the best. Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address. It's ok being in love girl, but then fun is second best. Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address.

in the city,"In the city there's a thousand things I want to say to you. But whenever I approach you, you make me look a fool. I wanna say, I wanna tell you. About the young ideas. But you turn them into fears. In the city there's a thousand faces all shining bright. And those golden faces are under 25. They wanna say, they gonna tell ya. About the young idea. You better listen now you've said your bit-a. And I know what you're thinking. You still think I am crap. But you'd better listen man. Because the kids know where it's at. In the city there's a thousand men in uniforms. And I've heard they now have the right to kill a man. We wanna say, we gonna tell ya. About the young idea. And if it don't work, at least we said we've tried. In the city, in the city."
in the crowd,"When I'm in the crowd, I don't see anything. My mind goes a blank, in the humid sunshine. when I'm in the crowd I don't see anything. I fall into a trance, at the supermarket. the noise flows me along, as I catch falling cans. of baked beans on toast, technology is the most.. and everyone seems just like me,. they struggle hard to set themselves free. and their waiting for the change. When I'm in the crowd, I can't remember my name. and my only link is a pint of Wall's ice cream. when I'm in the crowd - I don't see anything. Sometimes I think that it's a plot,. an equilibrium melting pot. The government sponsors underhand. When I'm in the crowd. When I'm in the crowd. When I'm in the crowd. And everyone seems that they're acting a dream. 'cause they're just not thinking about each other. and they're taking orders, which are media spawned. and they should know better, now you have been warned. and don't forget you saw it here first. When I'm in the crowd. When I'm in the crowd. When I'm in the crowd. And life just simply moves along. in simple houses, simple jobs. and no ones wanting for the change. When I'm in the crowd. When I'm in the crowd."
in the midnight hour,"I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour. That's when my love comes tumbling down. I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour. That's when there's no one else around.

Midnight hour, oh baby. Yes I am."
"in the street, today","In the street today. Murder on the terraces. And fools in high places. It's all so sickening. And we're so satisfied -. In the street tonight. Hate on every pavement. Paranoia on shop doorways. The kids want some action. And who can fucking blame them now. It's all so sickening, and we're so satisfied."
it's too bad,All we seem to do is talk about it. we always end up shouting about it. there was a time we could overcome it. But it's too late to say we'll just forget it. It's too bad that we had to break up. and too much said for us to every make up. I could get by if I could just forget you. but things remind me and I feel so sad now. I could say I'm sorry. but it's not the point is it?. you want to play your games and. you don't mind if I get hurt. Same old feeling everytime I see you. and every avenue I walk I'm behind you. your back is turned and your eyes are closed girl.
just who is the 5 o'clock hero?,Hello darlin' - I'm home again. Covered in shit and aches and pains. Too knackered to think so give me time to come round. Just gimme the living room beat to the TV sound -. My hard earned dough goes in bills and the larder. And that Prince Philip tells us we gotta work harder!. It seems a constant struggle just to exist. Scrimping and saving and crossing of lists -. From this window I've seen the whole world pass. From dawn to dusk I've heard the last laugh laughed. I've seen enough tears to wash away this street. I've heard wedding bells chime and a funeral march. When as one life finishes another one starts -. Alright then love so I'll be off now. It's back to the lunchbox and worker/management rows. There's gotta be more to this old life then this.
life from a window,"Looking from a hilltop, watching from a lighthouse. just dreaming. Up here I can see the world. Ooh, sometimes it don't look nice - that's ok. Life from a window, I'm just taking in the view. Life from a window, observing everything around you. Staring at a grey sky, try to paint it blue. Teenage blue. Some people that you see around you. Tell you how devoted they are. They tell you something on sunday, but come monday. They've changed their minds. I'm looking from a skyscraper. I'm standing on the post office tower"
little boy soldiers,"Its funny how you never knew what my name was,. Our only contact was a form for the election.. These days I find that you don't listen,. These days I find that we're out of touch,. These days I find that I'm too busy,. So why the attention now you want my assistance -. What have you done for me.. You've gone and got yourself in trouble,. No you want me to help you out.. These days I find that I can't be bothered,. These days I find that its all too much,. To pick up a gun and shoot a stranger,. But I've got no choice so here I come - war games.. I'm up on the hills, playing little boy soldiers,. Reconnaissance duty up at 5:30.. Shoot shoot shoot and kill the natives,. You're one of us and we love you for that.. Think of honour, Queen and country,. You're a blessed son of the British Empire,. God's on our side and so is Washington.. Come out on the hills with the little boy soldiers.. Come on outside - I'll sing you a lullaby,. Or tell a tale of how goodness prevailed.. We ruled the world - we killed and robbed,. The fucking lot - but we don't feel bad.. It was done beneath the flag of democracy,. You'll believe and I do - yes I do - yes I do -. yes I do -. These days I find that I can't be bothered,. To argue withthem well what's the point,. Better to take your shots and drop down dead,. then they send you home in a pine overcoat. With a letter to your mum. Saying find enclosed one son - one medal and a note -. to say he won.."
liza radley,"Liza Radley, see the girl with long hair. See her creeping 'cross summer lawns at midnight. And all the people in the town where we live say â€œshe's not quite rightâ€ She don't fit in with a small town. They just can't understand why she's doesnâ€™t stay in hospital. In a darkened room itâ€™s for their lives only she cries. Liza Radley, see her jump through loneliness. Liza Radley, take me when you go. And as the people pass by, their heads in the air. On to with their lifeâ€™s, she records a lonely sigh,. But no matter what they say, in her mind she knows,. Their dream of life they wonâ€™t never find.

london girl,"Do you know what you're looking for?. Streets of gold, fame and fortune?. You didn't fancy working in a factory. But your mum and dad didn't agree. You slept on Waterloo station at first. But now you've moved to a posher squat. You wonder where your next meal will come from. Still it's better than living at home. You're looking tired 'cause it's been three weeks. Since you changed your clothes or washed your feet. But you're learning fast all the time. How to cadge cigarettes and pills.

london traffic,London traffic (state of confusion). London traffic (blocking the streets). London traffic (going nowhere). London traffic (polluting the air). Drive round London in a car. Don't really want to go far. So many cars fill the streets. Wonder why we bother at all. London traffic is a problem. London traffic too many cars. One way systems look very neat. Coloured signs direct the streets. No one knows the answer. No one seems to care. Take a look at our city. Take the traffic elsewhere. Leave the city free from traffic. Give the place a chance to survive. Dirt and filth cover London.
man in the corner shop,Puts up the closed sign does the man in the corner shop. Serves his last then he says goodbye to him. He knows it is a hard life. But its nice to be your own boss really. Walks off home does the last customer. He is jealous of the man in the corner shop. He is sick of working at the factory. Says it must be nice to be your own boss (really). Sells cigars to the boss from the factory. He is jealous is the man in the corner shop. He is sick of struggling so hard. Says it might be nice to own a factory. Go to church do the people from the area. All shapes and classes sit and pray together. For here they are all one. For God created all men equal.
monday,"Rainclouds came and stole my thunder -. Left me barren like a desert. But a sunshine girl like you. It's worth going through -. I will never be embarrassed about love again -. Tortured winds that blew me over -. When I start to think that I'm something special. They tell me that I'm not -. And they're right and I'm glad and I'm not -.

news of the world,"Power, Pop!. Read about the things that happen throughout the world. Don't be believe in everything you see or hear. The neighbours talk day in day out about the goings on. They tell us what they want - they don't give an inch. Look at the pictures taken by the cameras they cannot lie. The truth is in what you see - not what you read. Little men tapping things out - points of view. Remember their views are not the gospel truth. Don't believe it all. Find out for yourself. Check before you spread. News of the world. Never doubt. Never ask. Never moan. Never search. Never find. Never know. Each morning our key to the world comes through the door. More than often its just a comic, not much more. Don't take it too serious - not many do. Read between the lines and you'll find the truth."

I don't even mind guys trying to compete. I know our love's as strong as the beat, when we're dancing. Non-stop dancing. People say we're wasting our time. They don't seem to understand. Cause when you're dancing all night long. It gives you the feeling that you belong. Non-stop dancing, I'm truly out of my head. But I ain't sleepy, baby, baby. You see the dance is my bed. Things are really getting wild. The kids are screaming for that James Brown style, when we're dancing."
pity poor alfie/fever,"The streets of pleasure took you to top. But every light was red and every sign said stop. I felt so confined, just like glued to this spot, oh. 'Cause we were sleeping in the noon day sun. We escaped the test and the marathon run. And no one heard and these mournful cries of ""Alfie!"". We put a stop to that. Whoa, but Alfie, I wish you'd please come back. So no one's hurt - we might have made it through. But now there's nothing left except the memories of you. With overflowing powerful woes. 'Cause there's real and fright. To the top of the stairs to find poor Alfie. And blood stained letters don't count for change. And don't look for blame. 'Cause it's a fair exchange. For the last adventure I have left. 'Cause we were sleeping in the noon day sun. We escaped the test and the marathon run. And no one heard and these mournful cries of ""Alfie!"". We put a stop to that. Oh, but Alfie, I wish you'd please come back. Now it's gonna be hard for me to make it through. When all that's left is the memories of. Nothing left except the memories of war and pain. Please pity poor Alfie. Poor Alfie put a stop to that. Poor Alfie I wish you'd please come back. Poor Alfie put a stop to that. Oh, but Alfie I wish you'd please come back. Poor Alfie!. You'll never know how much I love you. Never know how much I care. 'Cause when you put your arms around me. I get a fever I can hardly bear. You give me fever. When you kiss me. Fever when you hold me tight. Fever through the daytime. I get a fever all through the night. Sun lights up the daytime. Moon lights up the night. I light up when you kiss me. And I know you're gonna treat me right. You give me fever. When you kiss me. Fever when you hold me tight. Fever through the daytime. I get a fever all through the night. Bless my soul I love you. Take me so far away. Take these arms I'll never use. Just believe what my words have to say. You give me fever. When you kiss me. Fever when you hold me tight. Fever through the daytime. I get a fever all through the night. You give me fever."
pop art poem,"Kid walks down the street. Bumps into emptiness. Pow!. Kid looks at the sky. Looks at his watch. Decides to go home. Zap!. Kid spies pretty girl. Walks up to her. Kisses her. On the mouth. Where else?. And all day long I was thinking. I was thinking this, that and the other. And.... When!. So am I. I made this up as I went along. It's good innit?."
precious,Your precious love - that means so much. will it ever stop or will I just lose touch. What I want to say - but my words just fail. Is that I need it so I can't help myself. Like a hungry child - I just help myself. And when I'm all full up - I go out to play. But I don't mean to bleed you dry. Or take you over for the rest of your life. It's just that I need something solid in mine. Lonely as the moors on a winter's morning. Quiet as the sea on a good calm night. In your tranquil shadow - I try and follow. I hear your distant show clicks. To the midnight beat -. I feel trapped in sorrow. In this imagery.
pretty green,I've got a pocket full of pretty green -. I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine -. I'm gonna put it in the juke box -. It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade -. This is the pretty green - this is society. You can't do nothing - unless it's in the pocket. - oh no -. I've got a pocket full of pretty green. I'm gonna give it to the man behind the counter. He's gonna give me food and water -. I'm gonna eat that and look for more -. And they didn't teach me that in school -. It's something that I learnt on my own -. That power is measured by the pound or the fist -. It's as clear as this oh -. I've got a pocket full of Pretty Green!.
private hell,"Closer than close - you see yourself -. A mirrored image - of what you wanted to be.. As each day goes by - a little more -. You can't remember - what it was you wanted anyway.. The fingers feel the lines - they prod the space -. Your ageing face - the face that once was so beautiful,. is still there but unrecognizable -. Private Hell.. The man who you once loved - is bald and fat -. And seldom in - working late as usual.. Your interest has waned - you feel the strain -. The bed springs snap - on the occasions he lies upon you -. close your eyes and think of nothing but -. Private Hell.. Think of Emma - wonder what she's doing -. Her husband Terry - and your grandchildren.. Think of Edward - who's still at college -. You send him letters - which he doesn't acknowledge.. 'Cause he don't care,. They don't care.. 'Cause they're all going through their own - Private Hell.. The morning slips away - in a valium haze,. And catalogues - and numerous cups of coffee.. In the afternoon - the weekly food,. Is put in bags - as you float off down the high street. The shop windows reflect - play a nameless host,. To a closet ghost - a picture of your fantasy -. A victim of your misery - and Private Hell. Alone at 6 o'clock - you drop a cup -. You see it smash - inside you crack -. You can't go on - but you sweep it up -. Safe at last inside your Private Hell.. Sanity at last inside your Private Hell.."
running on the spot,"I was hoping we'd make real progress -. But it seems we have lost the power. Any tiny step of advancement. Is like a raindrop falling into the ocean -. We're running on the spot - always have - always will?. We're just the next generation of the emotionally crippled.. Though we keep piling up the building blocks. The structure never seems to get any higher. Because we keep kicking out the foundations. And stand useless while our lives fall down.. I believe in life - and I believe in love. But the world in which I live in - keeps trying to prove me wrong.. Out in the pastures we call society. You can't see further than the bottom of your glass. Only young but easily shocked. You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -. Just like sheep - little lambs into the slaughter. Don't fully grasp what exactly is wrong -. Truth is you never cared - still -. You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -. Intelligence should be our first weapon. And stop reveling in rejection. And follow yourselves, not some ageing drain brain. Whose quite content to go on feeding you garbage. We're running on the spot - always have - always will?. We're just the next generation of the emotionally crippled.."

Saturdays kids play one arm bandits,. they never win but that's not the point is it,. Dip in silver paper when their pints go flat,. How about that - far out!. Their mums and dads smoke Capstan non filters,. Wallpaper lives 'cause they all die of cancer,. What goes on - what goes wrong.. Save up their money for a holiday,. To Selsey Bill or Bracklesham Bay,. Think about the future - when they'll settle down,. Marry the girl next door - with one on the way.. These are the real creatures that time has forgot,.

scrape away,"Your twisted cynicism - makes me feel sick -. Your open disgust for 'Idealistic naive'. You've given up hope you're jaded and ill. The trouble is your thoughts a catching disease. Ooh - you need to get away -. Ooh - you need a change of pace -. Because you're all dried up and you don't believe. You reckon I'm dreaming when I say I still feel real. You say you work for yourself and its the only way. But I look at you talking and to me you just scrape away -. What makes once young minds get in this state,. Is it age or just the social climate. You're talking like some fucking hardend MP. You're saying power's all!. And it's power you NEED!. Ooh - you need to get away -. Ooh - you need a change of place -. Because you've given up on hope -. You're emotionless -. You've no need for love it's just hate, hate, hate.. But I look at you shaking and it is you -. who is scraping away. You who is scraping away.."
set the house ablaze,"I was in the pub last night. A mutual friend of ours said. He'd seen you in the uniform. Yeah the leather belt looks manly. The black boots butch. But oh what a bastard to get off. Promises, promises. They offer real solutions. But hatred has never won for long. You was so open minded. But by someone blinded. And now your sign says closed.. Promises, promises. They offer real solutions. But hatred has never won for long. I think we've lost our perception -. I think we've lost sight of the goals we should. be working for. I think we've lost our reason. We stumble blindly and that vision must be restored!. I wish that there was something. I could do about it. I wish that there was some way. I could try to fight it. Scream and shout it -. But something you said set the house ablaze!. It is called indoctrination. And it happens on all levels. But it has nothing to do with equality. It has nothing to do with democracy. And though it professes to. It has nothing to do with humanity."
shopping,High town - high street connections. With clothes at the top of my list. You could steal things from the jewelry department. But you can't take kind or steal a kiss. As I flit from shop window to window. I'm trying to pick up a friendly bargin. But it's not like the adverts all make out. And there's no one to greet you as a friend. I dress myself for the part. I smile but it just don't work. Something about my face - must just be the wrong shape. I better try another brand pretty quick. I'm haunted by the colours and holding a reminder that I must be inadequate. High town - high street connection. With clothes at the top of my list.

smithers-jones,"Here we go again, it's Monday at last,. He's heading for the Waterloo line,. To catch the 8 a.m. fast, its usually dead on time,. Hope it isn't late, got to be there by nine..

So bad about us. Sad - never meant to break up. Sad - suppose we'll never make up. Sad about us.
sounds from the street,"Sounds from the street, sounds so sweet. What's my name?. It hurts my brain to think. Sounds from the city, sound so pretty. Young bands playing. Young kids digging - and I dig them. The usa's got the sea. Yeah, but the british kid's got the streets. I don't mind, the city's. Right. Sounds from the street, sounds just fine. I know I come from woking and you say I'm a fraud. But my heart's in the city, where it belongs. Words from the voices. Rock and roll rejoices. It's something new, it's something young for a change. Sounds from the street, they sound so sweet. They gotta take notice. Why should they stop us? we don't need them. We're never gonna change a thing. And the situation's rapidly decreasing.

stoned out of my mind,Baby when I found out you were lying. Playing around and conniving. Undesired tears I was crying. 'Cause sugar coated as I was buying. I was just a backseat driver in a car of love. Going wherever you take me. Don't know why I put up with the pain. 'Cause no one else can make me. You've got me going - stoned out of my mind. And when you led me to the waters I drank it. But I drank more than I could hold. And you took my mind off my body. And now you want to take my soul. Where can I run?. Where can I hide?. Who can I talk to?. Tell me what more can I do?. You've got me going - stoned out of my mind. Playing around with every guy in town. It's funny I just can't put you down. See my head - it's spinning around. Since the day you let me down.
strange town,"Found myself in a strange town. Though I've only been here for three weeks now. I've got blisters on my feet. Trying find a friend in Oxford Street. I bought an A to Z guide book. Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs. But when you ask in a strange town. They say don't know, don't care. And I've got to go, mate. They worry themselves about feeling low. They worry themselves about the dreadful snow. They all ignore me 'cause they don't know. I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs. You've got to move in a straight line. You've got to walk and talk in four four time. You can't be weird in a strange town. You'll be betrayed by your accent and manners. You've got to wear the right clothes. Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose. You can't be nice in a strange town. 'Cause we don't know, don't care. And we got to go, man. Rush my money to the record shops. I stop off in a back street. Buy myself a snort. We got our own manifesto. Be kind to queers. And I'm so glad the revolution's here. It's nice and warm now!. I've finished with clubs where the music's loud. 'Cause I don't see a face in a single crowd. There's no one there. I look in the mirror. But I can't be seen. Just a thin, clean layer of Mister Sheen. Looking back at me. Oh, oh. Found myself in a strange town. Though I've only been here for three weeks now. I've got blisters on my feet. Trying find a friend in Oxford Street. I bought an A to Z guide book. Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs. They say don't know, don't care. And I've got to go, mate.

tales from the riverbank,"Bring you a tale from the pastel fields. Where we ran when we were young. This is a tale from the water meadows. Trying to spread some hope into your heart. It's mixed with happiness - it's mixed with tears. Both life a death are carried in this stream. That open space you could run for miles. Now you don't get so many to the pound. True it's a dream mixed with nostalgia. But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to. That I'll always run to. Won't you join me by the riverbank. Paradise found down by the still waters. Joined in the race to the rainbow's end. No fears no worries just a golden country. Woke at sunrise, went home at sunset. Now life is so critical, life is too cynical. We lose our innocence, we lose our very soul. True it's a dream mixed with nostalgia. But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to. That I'll always run to. True it's a dream mixed with nostalgia. But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to. That I always run to. Won't you join me by the riverbank. Come on and join me by the riverbank."
that's entertainment,A police car and a screaming siren. A pnuematic drill and ripped up concrete. A baby wailing and stray dog howling. The screech of brakes and lamplights blinking. That's entertainment. A smash of glass and the rumble of boots. An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth. Paint splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat. Lights going out and a kick in the balls. That's entertainment. Days of speed and slow time Mondays. Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday. Watching the news and not eating your tea. A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls. That's entertainment. Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning. Opening the windows and breathing in petrol. An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard. Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays. That's entertainment. Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes. Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume. A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac. Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway. That's entertainment. Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight. Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude. Getting a cab and travelling on buses. Reading the grafitti about slashed seat affairs. That's entertainment
the bitterest pill (i ever had to swallow),"In your white lace and your wedding bells. You look the picture of contented new wealth. But from the on-looking fool who believed your lies. I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive. For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow. The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows. When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me. Out of grey skies to change my misery. The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place. But now I watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room. For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow. The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows. The bitterest pill is mine to take. If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate. Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life. Twisted and broken dawn, no days with sunlight. The dying spark, you left your mark on me. The promise of your kiss, but with someone else. For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow. The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows. The bitterest pill is mine to take."
the butterfly collector,So you finally got what you wanted. You've achieved your aim by making me walk in line. And when you just can't get any higher. You use your senses to suss out this week's climber. And the small fame that you've acquired. Has brought you into cult status. But to me you're still a collector. There's tarts and whores but you're much more. You're a different kind 'cause you want their minds. And you just don't care 'cause you've got no pride. It's just a face on your pillowcase. That thrills you. And you started looking much older. And your fashion sense is second rate like your perfume. But to you in your little dream world. You're still the Queen of the butterfly collectors. As you carry on 'cause it's all you know. You can't light a fire. You can't cook or sew. You get from day to day by filling your head.

I mean, nobody wants to die, although the crowd say they do. Look, life is very intricate, when you're in the crowd. Life becomes the movies. And everyone has a role. It's easy being the actor. When the combine's the only star -. Sunday papers. And the dailies. Ena Sharples. Page 3 girls. News at ten. War in Rhodesia. Far away. In a distant land. But we're alright. We're nice and warm here.

It was going to be pie in the sky -. But the piss stench hallways and broken down lifts. Say the planners dream went wrong. If people were made to live in boxes. God would have given them string. To tie around their selves at bed time. And stop their dreams falling through the ceiling. And the public school boy computers -. Keep spewing out our future -. The house in the country designs the 14th floor. Old Mrs. Smith don't get out much more -. Coitus interruptus 'cause of next doors rows. Your washing gets nicked when the lights go out -. Baby's scream in the nightmare throng."
thick as thieves,"Times were so tough, but not as tough as they are now. We were so close and nothing came between us. and the world. No personal situations. Thick as thieves us, we'd stick together for all time. And we meant it but it turns out just for a while. We stole - the friendship that bound us together. We stole from the schools and their libraries. We stole from the drugs that sent us to sleep. We stole from the drink that made us sick. We stole anything that we couldn't keep. And it was enough - we didn't have to spoil anything. And always be as thick as thieves. Like a perfect stranger - you came into my life. Then like the perfect lone ranger - you rode away. rode away. Rode away - rode away. We stole the love from young girls in ivory towers. We stole autumn leaves and summer showers. We stole the silent wind that says you are free. We stole everything that we could see. But it wasn't enough. and now we've gone and spoiled everthing. Now we're no longer as thick as thieves. You came into my life. Then like a perfect stranger you walked away - walked away. Walked away - walked away. Thick as thieves us - we'd stick together for all time. And we meant it but it turns out just for awhile. We stole the friendship that bound us together. We stole the burning sun in the open sky. We stole the twinkling stars in the black night. We stole the green belt fields that made us believe. We stole everything that we could see. But something came along that changes our minds. I don't know what and I don't know why. But we seemed to grow up in a flash of time. While we watched our ideals helplessly unwind. No - we're no longer as thick as thieves - no. We're not as thick as we used to be - no. We're no longer as thick as thieves - no. We're not as thick as we used to be. No it wasn't enough - and we've gone and spoiled everything"
time for truth,Whatcha trying to say that haven't tried to say before. You're just another red balloon with a lot of hot gass. Why don't you fuck off?. And you think you've got it worked out. And you think you've got it made. And you trying to play the hero. But you never walk home in the dark. I think it's time for truth. And the truth is you've lost uncle Jimmy. Admit your failure and decline with honour while you can. And you think you've got it sussed out. And you think that we're brain washed. And you're trying for a police state. So you can rule our body and minds. What ever happend to the great empire?. You bastards haved turned it into manure. Time for the young to stick together now. I bet you sleep at night with silk sheets and a clean mind. While killers roam the streets in numbers dressed in blue. And you're trying to hide it from us. But you know what I mean. Bring forward those six pigs. We wanna see them swing sod high
to be someone (didn't we have a nice time),"To be someone must be a wonderful thing. A famous footballer a rock singer. Or a big film star, yes I think I would like that. To be rich and have lots of fans. Have lots of girls to prove that I'm a man. And be no. 1 - and liked by everyone. Getting drugged up with my trendy friends. They really dig me and I dig them. And the bread I spend - is like my fame -it's quickly diminished. And there's no more swimming in a guitar shaped pool. No more reporters at my beck and call. No more cocaine it's only ground chalk. No more taxis now we'll have to walk. But didn't we have a nice time. Didn't we have a nice time. Oh wasn't it such a fine time. I realize I should have stuck to my guns. Instead shit out to be one of the bastard sons. And lose myself - I know it was wrong - but it's cost me a lot. And there's no more drinking after the club shuts down. I'm out on me arse with the rest of the clowns. It's really frightening without a bodyguard"
tonight at noon,"Tonight at noon, tonight at noon. When we meet in the midnight hour,. I will bring you night flowers (coloured). Like your eyes. Tonight at noon, I'll touch your hand. Held for a moment amongst strangers. Amongst the dripping trees. Country girl. Walking in city squares in winter rain -. Walking down muddy lanes or empty streets -. Arranging a time and place to meet -. Tonight at noon, you'll feel my warmth. You'll feel my body inside you. We'll be together for hours. Time and tears -. Won't wait for evermore. For the time is now -. And now is the time to explore. Why waste the world outside."
trans global express,Ordinary people don't get time to think. not that it's their fault. cos you have to hustle and bustle about your work. just to make sure the food gets bought. goverments threaten you with recession. then they threaten you with war. how the other side wants to take away. all the things you ain't got no more. keep us divided with their greed and hate. keep you struggling to put the food on your plate.. Imagine if tomorrow the workers went on strike. not just British Leyland but the whole world. who would earn their profits?. who would make their bombs?. you'd see the hands of oppression fumble. and their systems crash to the ground. and you men in uniform will have to learn the lesson too. not to turn against your own kind. whenever governments tell you to.. Get the trans-global express moving. and see our marvellous leaders quiver. they know that if it happens. their lazy days are over. the day the working people join together. we'll all rest much more easy. the responsibilty you must bear. when it's your own future in your hands. maybe a hard one to face up to. but at least you will own yourself!.
wasteland,Meet me on the wastelands - later this day. We'll sit and talk and hold hands maybe. For there's not much else to do in this drab and colourless. Place. We'll sit amongst the rubber tyres. Amongst the discarded bric-a-brac. People have no use for. amongst the smouldering embers of. Yesterday. And when or if the sun shines. Lighting our once beautiful features. We'll smile but only for seconds. For to be caught smiling is to acknowledge life. A brave but useless show of compassion. And that is forbidden in this drab and colourless world. Meet me on the wastelands - the ones behind. The old houses - the ones - left standing pre-war. The ones overshadowed by the monolith monstrosities. Councils call homes. And there amongst the shit - the dirty linen. The holy coca-cola tins - the punctured footballs. The ragged dolls - the rusting bicycles. We'll sit and probably hold hands. And watch the rain fall - watch it - watch it. Tumble and fall - tumble and falling. Like our lives - like our lives. Just like our lives. We'll talk about the old days. When the wasteland was release when we could play. And think - without feeling guilty. Meet me later but we'll have to hold hands. Tumble and fall - tumble and falling. Like our lives - like our lives. Exactly like our lives
we've only started,It's like the middle of a ... age. I feel the space between us all. A forced expense. But the big divide. Between the devil and the deep blue sea. Let's take a chance with beginner's luck. We have nothing so there's nothing to lose. I can't believe the only reasons we're here. Are the reasons in the Bank of England. Hear me now. We've only started. They'll just exploit us but it's only day one. We haven't got that far. Not far at all.
when you're young,"Life is timeless, days are long when you're young. You used to fall in love with everyone. Any guitar and any bass drum. Life is a drink and you get drunk when you're young. Life is new and there's things to be done. You can't wait to be grown up. Acceptance into the capital world. You pull on some weed, then you pull on someone when you're young. But you find out life isn't like that. It's so hard to comprehend. Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end. But you don't mind you've got time on your side. And they're never gonna make you stand in line. You're just waiting for the right time. You're fearless and brave - you can't be stopped when you're young. You swear you're never ever gonna work for someone. No corporations for the new age sons. Tears of rage roll down your face. But still you say ""it's fun"". And you find out life isn't like that. It's so hard to understand. Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam. It's got you in its grip before your born. It's done with the use of a dice and a board. They let you think you're king but you're really a pawn. You're fearless and brave - you can't be stopped when you're young. You used to fall in love with everyone."
worlds apart,"Worlds apart, you and I, weâ€™re worlds apart. The difference between every day. I canâ€™t think of the words to say. Worlds apart, you and I, weâ€™re worlds apart. Iâ€™ve been in some clubs where the musicâ€™s loud. â€˜cos I see your face in every crowd. But itâ€™s not really you. Itâ€™s like having a cold on a summers day. Something ainâ€™t right and I want you to stay. You must know that."
