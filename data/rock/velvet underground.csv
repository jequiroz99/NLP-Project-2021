And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds. 'Cause when the smack begins to flow. Then I really don't care anymore. Ah, when that heroin is in my blood. And the blood is in my head. Man thank God that I'm as good as dead. And thank your God that I'm not aware. And thank God that I just don't care. And I guess that I just don't know. Oh, and I guess that I just don't know"

the black angel's death song,"(Reed, Cale). The myriad choices of his fate. Set themselves out upon a plate. For him to choose. What had he to lose. Not a ghost bloodied country. All covered with sleep. Where the black angel did weep. Not an old city street in the east. Gone to choose. And wandering's brother. Walked on through the night. With his hair in his face. On a long splintered cut from the knife of G.T.. The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn. Until we said so long. To his skull-shrill yell. Shining brightly red-rimmed and. Red-lined with the time. Infused with the choice of the mind. On ice skates scraping chunks. From the bells. Cut mouth bleeding razor's. Forgetting the pain. Antiseptic remains cool goodbye. So you fly. To the cozy brown snow of the east. Gone to choose, choose again. Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget. Where you come from. The stools of your eyes. Serve to realize fame, choose again. And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse. For the loss of a horse. Went the bowels and a tail of a rat. Come again, choose to go. And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame. Have your head bobbed and weaved. Choose a side to be on. If the stone glances off. Split didactics in two. Leave the colors of the mouse trails. Don't scream, try between. If you choose, if you choose, try to lose. For the loss of remain come and start. Start the game I che che che che I. Che che ka tak koh. Choose to choose. Choose to choose, choose to go."
the gift,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit. It was now Mid-August which meant he had. been separated from Marsha for more than two months. Two months, and all he had. to show was three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone. calls. True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, and he to. Locust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. She would. date occasionally, but merely as amusement. She would remain faithful.. But lately Waldo had begun to worry. He had trouble sleeping at night and when. he did, he had horrible dreams. He lay awake at night, tossing and turning. underneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he. pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of. some neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.. It was more than the human mind could bear.. Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. Daytime fantasies of sexual. abandon permeated his thoughts. And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how. she really was. He, Waldo, alone understood this. He had intuitively grasped. every nook and cranny of her psyche. He had made her smile. She needed him, and. he wasn't there (Awww...).. The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled. to appear. He'd just finished mowing and etching the Edelsons lawn for a dollar. fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from. Marsha. There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company. of America inquiring into his awing needs. At least they cared enough to write.. It was a New York company. You could go anywhere in the mails. Then it struck. him. He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,. true, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly simple. He would ship himself. parcel post, special delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to. purchase the necessary equipment. He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a. medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build. He judged that. with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably. A few airholes,. some water, perhaps some midnight snacks, and it would probably be as good as. going tourist.. By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly packed and the post. office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. He'd marked the package. ""Fragile"", and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber. cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried to picture the look of awe and. happiness on Marshas face as she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the. deliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. She. would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of. this before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne. up. He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.. Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It had been a very rough. weekend. She had to remember not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about. it though. After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all,. it was certainly the way of nature, and even though, no he didn't love her, he. did feel an affection for her. And after all, they were grown adults. Oh, what. Bill could teach Waldo - but that seemed many years ago.. Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen. door and into the kitchen. ""Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside."" ""Ach, I. know what you mean, I feel all icky!"" Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton. robe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on. the kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. ""I'm supposed to be. taking these salt pills, but,"" she wrinkled her nose, ""they make me feel like. throwing up."" Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd. seen on television. ""God, don't even talk about that."" She got up from the. table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue. vitamins. ""Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,"" and then attempted to. touch her knees. ""I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again."". She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the. telephone. ""Maybe Bill'll call,"" she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on. a cuticle. ""After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him."" ""I. know what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place."". She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. ""The thing is, after a. while, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't. really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know. what I mean."" She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over. her mouth. ""I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while,"" here. she bent forward in a whisper, ""I wanted to!"" Now she was laughing very loudly.. It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang. the doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson. opened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his. green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had. gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den. ""What do you. think it is?"" Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.. She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living. room. ""I dunno."". Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the. muffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down. the center of the carton. ""Why don't you look at the return address and see who. it's from?"" Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the. vibrating footsteps. It would be soon.. Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. ""Ah, god,. it's from Waldo!"" ""That schmuck!"" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation.. ""Well, you might as well open it,"" said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the. staple flap. ""Ah sst,"" said Marsha, groaning, ""he must have nailed it shut."". They tugged on the flap again. ""My God, you need a power drill to get this. thing open!"" They pulled again. ""You can't get a grip."" They both stood still,. breathing heavily.. ""Why don't you get a scissor,"" said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but. all she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her. father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when. she came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter. in her hand. ""This is the best I could find."" She was very out of breath.. ""Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die."" She sank into a large fluffy couch and. exhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the. end of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough. room. ""God damn this thing!"" she said feeling very exasperated. Then smiling,. ""I got an idea."" ""What?"" said Marsha. ""Just watch,"" said Sheila, touching her. finger to her head.. Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could. hardly breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his. heart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and. walked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her. knees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the. long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through. the cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of. Waldo Jeffers head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red. to pulsate gently in the morning sun.."

wrap your troubles in dreams,"Wrap your troubles in dreams. send them all away. Put them in a bottle. and across the seas they'll stay. Speak not of misfortune. speak not of your woes. Just steal yourself a Holy death. crouching by the door. Ride and sway to music's pain. searing with the sides. Caress death with a lover's touch. for it shall be your bride. Wrap your troubles in dreams. send them all away. Put them in a bottle. and across the seas they'll stay. Purple is to yellow. as sunlight is to rain. Happiness and death you'll find. loveliness in pain. Slash the golden whip it snaps. across the lover's sides. The earth trembles without tremors. preparing for to die. Wrap your troubles in dreams. send them all away. Put them in a bottle. and across the seas they'll stay. Salty ocean waves and sprays. come crashing to the shore. Bullies kick and kill young loves. down on bar-room floors. The gleaming knife cuts early. through the midnight air. Cutting entrance in its path. blood runs without care. Violence echoes through the land. in heart of every man. The knife, it stabs existent wounds. puss runs through meant to tear. Excrements filters through the brain. hatred bends the spine. Filth covers the body pores. to be cleansed by dying time. Wrap your troubles in dreams. send them all away. Put them in a bottle. and across the seas they'll stay."
