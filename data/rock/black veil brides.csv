knives and pens,"1st person: In looking at young people involved in the occult do you see any particular type of dress?. 2nd person: I have personally observed people wearing uhh, black fingernails, having their hair painted black, wearing black tshirts. Sometimes they will tattoo themselves.... Alone at last we can sit and fight. And I've lost all faith in this blurring light. But stay right here we can change our plight. We're storming through this despite what's right. One final fight, for this tonight, woah. With knives and pens we made our plight. Lay your heart down the ends in sight. Conscience begs for you to do what's right. Everyday it's still the same dull knife. Stab it through and justify your pride. One final fight, for this tonight, woah. With knives and pens we made our plight, woah. And I can't go on without your love, you lost, you never held on. We tried our best. Turn out the light. Turn out the light.

goodbye agony,"Heaven's gone, the battle's won. I had to say goodbye. Lived and learned from every fable. Written by your mind. And I wonder how to move on. From all I had inside. Place my cards upon the table. In blood I draw the line. I've given all my pride. Living a life of misery. Always there, just underneath. Haunting me, quietly, alone. (It's killing me, killing me). Dead and gone, what's done is done. You were all I had become. I'm letting go of what I once believed. So goodbye agony. I watch the stars and setting suns. As the years are passing by. I never knew that hope was fatal. Until I looked it in the eye. And now I'm not sure I am able. To reach the other side. I'm casting out the light. Living a life of misery. Always there, just underneath. Haunting me, quietly, alone. (It's killing me, killing me). Dead and gone, what's done is done. You are all I had become. I'm letting go of what I once believed. So goodbye agony. Goodbye agony. Not alone in forgiving. The faithful and the blind. Innocence is forsaken. I leave them all behind. And then I see that even angels never die. Living a life of misery. Always there, just underneath. Haunting me, quietly, alone. (It's killing me, killing me). Dead and gone, what's done is done. You are all I had become. I'm letting go of what I once believed. So goodbye agony. Goodbye agony. Goodbye agony"

No dust will ever grow on this frame,. One million years I will say your name.. I love you more than I can ever scream.. Booked our flight those years ago,. I said I love you as I left you.. Regrets still haunt my hollow head,. I promised you I will see you again, again.. I sit here and smile dear,. I smile because I think of you, I blush.. These bleeding hollow dials... This fuss.. A fuss is made of miles and travels when roadways are but stones and gravel.. A bleeding heart can conquer every crutch.. We booked our flight those years ago,. You said you loved me as you left me.. Regrets still haunt your saddened head but I promised you I will see you.. We booked our flight those years ago,. I said I loved you and I left you.. Regrets no longer in my head,. But I promised you and now I'm home again, again,. again, again, again, again.. I'm home again."
a devil for me,"Well now is the time to say your prayers. And now is the time to show your stuff. Cause' people talk but people separate,. It's the same damn excuse when danger is headed your. way. You talk the talk but do you walk the walk?. Your apathy is just a living flaw, you pull the. trigger. Count 1,2,3 it's a finger flip for you and a devil. for me. A wedding of the damned. This razor cuts the pain right out, we're bound until the end. My Love. You acted first you could have walked away. With broken parts and things you can't replace. You pull the trigger count 1,2,3 it's an ""anti christ"" for you. Fallen angel for me. [x2]. A wedding of the damned. This razor cuts the pain right out. We're bound until the end. My Love"

all your hate,"Use my breathe for every line you take, when you are. lonely words are holy.. a deadly grip on lies, sing to these blood red skies.. Hail Mary, whisper softly.. What you became. Some things never change and so we. we learn for All Your Hate. we are lost in your mistakes. play our hymn for the brand new day. we burn, we learned. Here's your martyr watch her morals bend, an empty story. we grow hungry. to reclaim the notes we lent, you cannot win.. when saints are glory. I'll die slowly."
ballad of the lonely hearts,"Don't turn around. They're screaming. Hear the sound. Still dreaming. Underground. This feeling. Holy angels die when you were. Born again. Now falling. For the damned. Still crawling. And my hand. Is calling. All the demons cry when you begin. Hear me all march on to the drumbeat. Hear me all march on. Here's to the lonely hearts. and the ones that never change. Here's to the fail starts and the song remains the same. We will carry on without the lonely hearts. They've done it all. Just listen. Take the fall. What's missing. Build a wall. Of fiction. All the heroes lie when they are. Sick and scared. Of falling. Loud and clear. The broken. Yet again. You're saving all the best. Hear me all march on to the drumbeat. Hear me all march on. Here's to the lonely hearts. and the ones that never change. Here's to the fail starts and the song remains the same. We will carry on without the lonely hearts. We will carry on without the lonely hearts. In the past you were a star. In your mind of paradise. Every dream that lives inside. Sometimes the future feels so far. And the devil always bites. Haunt your dreams. Here's to the lonely hearts. and the ones that never change. Here's to the fail starts. and the song remains the same. Here's to the lonely hearts and the ones that never change.

f.e.a.r - final transmission,This is to be our final transmission. The rebels have defeated our illustrious armies. They have damaged our intention of ugly. and defiant malevolance. All that we love and care for will. sink into the abyss of a new dark age. made more sinister and perhaps more protracted. by the light of perverted science and rebellion.

f.e.a.r. transmission 2: trust,"The rebels claim their brave new world is upon us. Do not be fooled by the chicanery in which they lay their claim. It is false, and their uprising will not succeed. You will place your trust in F. E. A. R. You must!"

Dead and gone, what's done is done. You were all I had become. I'm letting go of what I once believed. So goodbye agony. I watch the stars and setting suns. As the years are passing by. I never knew that hope was fatal. Until I looked it in the eye. And now I'm not sure I am able. To reach the other side. I'm casting out the light. Living a life of misery. Always there, just underneath. Haunting me, quietly, alone. (It's killing me, killing me). Dead and gone, what's done is done. You are all I had become. I'm letting go of what I once believed. So goodbye agony. Goodbye agony. Not alone in forgiving. The faithful and the blind. Innocence is forsaken. I leave them all behind. And then I see that even angels never die.

An illusion, it's all just Smoke and Mirrors. Hear it in her voice she's stalling. You were just another man. Your claims of love are falling. Now it's clear you can't win. Wake up,wake up, wake up. Hearts pounding, praying for romance. Wake up, wake up, wake up. It's sounding, time to try again. Lost in love you are. Out of touch so far. An illusion, it's all just Smoke and Mirrors. Always chasing scars. Never get too far. An illusion, it's all just Smoke and Mirrors. I'd rather be alone. Than put you on a throne. And lose my faith in Smoke and Mirrors. Black painted eyes. Cover the lies. It's time you threw away your cruel disguise. Lost in love you are. Out of touch so far. An illusion, it's all just Smoke and Mirrors. Always chasing scars. Never get too far. An illusion, it's all just Smoke and Mirrors. I'd rather be alone. Than put you on a throne. And lose my faith in Smoke and Mirrors"
sons of night,"We are dust and bone, a temple's made of stone. We have seen it all, even watch our armies fall. We are mysteries, secrets that they keep. So that they won't show, stories that you'll never know. When war begins, we'll ride again. Tonight, our chapter will begin. It's time, to wash away the sins. And no one can deny, we are the sons of night. We're driving faster through our pain. No more, waiting for a change. Black crosses stop the light, embrace the sons of night. Wear a mask of shame, hiding all the pain. That the world has taught, every word and evil thoughts. Courage hides the truth, rubbing on the youth. Of the given rights, heaven let the world ignite. When shadows crawl, you're not alone. Tonight, our chapter will begin. It's time, to wash away the sins. And no one can deny, we are the sons of night. We're driving faster through our pain. No more, waiting for a change. Black crosses stop the light, embrace the sons of night. Tonight, our chapter will begin. It's time, to wash away the sins.

sweet blasphemy,"Through sadness you have taught us. To be one with the crowd. Unveil the sacred order, hymns of falling down. You told the greatest stories. Of love and bleeding crowns. But to the sick and hungry. You cannot be found. We are young and we are strong. Through strength in self we become. Something more than they can be. I raise my heart and sing. That I won't believe this lie. I know there's something more inside. When darkness is all you see. This is our sweet blasphemy. Silence the crooked holy, unchain the tied and bound. No time for allegory, one true reigning sound. Unite the lonely mourning, a simple servant now. We are the only glory, hear us screaming loud. We are young and we are strong. I raise my heart and sing! (Oh!). That I won't believe this lie. I know there's something more inside. When darkness is all you see. This is our sweet blasphemy. (We are young and we are strong. Through strength in self we become. Something more than they can be. This is our sweet blasphemy). That I won't believe this lie. I know there's something more inside. When darkness is all you see.

Regrets still haunt my hollow head,. I promised you I will see you again, again.. I sit here and smile dear,. I smile because I think of you, I blush.. These bleeding hollow dials... This fuss..

Regrets still haunt your saddened head but I promised you I will see you.. We booked our flight those years ago,. I said I loved you and I left you.. Regrets no longer in my head,. But I promised you and now I'm home again, again,. again, again, again, again.. I'm home again."

the outsider,"This wall of stone. That they built to cage our minds. Grip the call of changing times. Like no one's home. They will burn down every bridge. Spread the world of ignorance. Fall blind to your eyes. (Forgive the innocent). Say a prayer, every night. All we hear must be right. I am the outsider. Living life for the end. Nothing left to defend. I am the outsider. I'm not the hope. That's just wishing for the past. Like bringing Christ back from the ash. Could save the world. They have risen from the sins. Of missing war we can't begin. And not in this time. Say a prayer, every night. All we hear must be right. I am the outsider. Living life for the end. Nothing left to defend. I am the outsider. Say a prayer every night. All we hear must be right. Every word. We believe. Say a prayer, every night. All we hear must be right (must be right). I am the outsider. Living life for the end. Nothing left to defend. I am the outsider. I am the outsider.

the shattered god,"Failure and apathy descends. Success just hasn't been your friend. You live a lie, high as the sky. This tastes like iron, blood and greed. Tell us of what you'll never be. I won't ask why, just let it die. Sleeping tight in your insanity. The truth can remedy. You stole it all. Sold them your soul. Give it up. You are, you are. Forever alone. Casting your stones. Give it up. You are, you are. The shattered God. I try with every ounce of hell. To pry you open from yourself. Twisting the knife regretting your life. Your eyes are empty like your bed. Somehow you haven't whelmed up dead. Chances passed by, you'll never fly. Singing hymns about the sins you see. But you'll never hear from me. You stole it all. Sold them your soul. Give it up. You are, you are. Forever alone. Casting your stones. Give it up. You are, you are. The shattered God. Feel the embrace all of the hate. I have watched you fall. Finding your words sounding like silence. You've already said it all. You stole it all. Sold them your soul. Give it up. You are, you are. Forever alone. Casting your stones. Give it up. You are, you are. The shattered God. You are, you are the shattered God"
they don't need to understand,"Rolling strong. The voice of my father said. Don't give up, don't be forgotten. This hell on Earth. I just wanna run away. They told me dreams don't grow from here. Stay alone, count your fears. Somewhere down the line I might figure it out. Singing all my songs. To bedroom walls. Deep inside my heart I'm still here. We're always running away. And we don't even stop to think about it. The world's in our hands, yeah. They don't need to understand. We do it our own way. No matter what they try to say about it. We've got our own plans, yeah. They don't need to understand. They don't need to understand. It may be tough, almost killed me. At least that's how I'll remember the story. Over the years I've forgotten how it was. But I survived and I won't walk down. The same old road that they all followed. It only leads to a life not meant for me. Singing all my songs. To bedroom walls. Deep inside my heart I'm here. We're always running away. And we don't even stop to think about it. The world's in our hands, yeah. They don't need to understand. We do it our own way. No matter what they try to say about it. We've got our own plans, yeah. They don't need to understand. Streets of my hometown. Seem strange now. They feel like a distant memory. I'm always fine cause I know you're trying. But you can never take this dream from me. We're always running away. And we don't even stop to think about it. The world's in our hands, yeah. They don't need to understand. We do it our own way.

It's a violent world, but today I'm still alive. I need you to tell me everything will be alright. To chase away the voices in the night. When they call my name. Have I gone insane?. These thoughts'll kill me. and everything that I hold true. And as I grow. I let my fear replace my youth. I won't turn back. I won't cross that hidden danger line. It's a loud and dark world. But I think I found the light. I need you to tell me everything will be alright. To chase away the voices in the night. When they call my name. Have I gone insane?. I need you to tell me everything will be alright. To chase away the voices in the night. When they call my name. Have I gone insane?. I need you to tell me everything will be alright. To chase away the voices in the night. When they call my name. Have I gone insane?"
world of sacrifice,"We're the faithful broken promises of the lies. The virtues beaten down into your empty eyes. A saint in not a weapon. It's a message, a message. a sermon of shame a demon that you want to blame. Sell you change you leave you in a world of flames. pain is not a blessing, it's a lesson, a lesson. Don't bow down to a world of hate. From your cradle to the grave. even if you've sacrifice beliefs to get through. And even if you take the side of lies over truth. Every day (every day) , the world will take what you give in to. So hold on to every breath of life, in a world of sacrifice. A personal slave, the one you left to die in vain. Sold you change you taught you all their selfish ways. faith becomes an addiction,not ambition ambition. Don't bow down to a world of hate. From your cradle to the grave. even if you've sacrifice beliefs you can't prove. And even if you take the side of lies over truth. Every day (every day) , the world will take what you give in to. So hold on to every breath of life, in a world of sacrifice. Hold on, in a world of sacrifice. Hold on, till your last breath is gone. Hold on, in a world of sacrifice. Hold on, till your last breath is gone. Cause even if you've sacrifice beliefs yo get through. And even if you take the side of lies over truth. Every day (every day) , the world will take what you give in to. So hold on to every breath of life, in a world of sacrifice. In a world of sacrifice, in a world of sacrifice"
wretched and divine,"I am the innocent. I am what could have been. The dreams you talk about,. Now left on broken skin. Here lies hysteria,. A land where chaos reigns. Global Disturbia,. Bows down to twisted ways.. A world of hate awaits. We are The Wild Ones. They all look the same. Our time has come. I am the chosen,. Wretched and Divine. I am the unspoken,. The one they left behind. Fearless, fight until we die. I am broken. The Wretched and Divine. I am the Devil's smile,. The one caught everyday. A hopeful hero's speech. Won't stop the years you bleed. I am a hurricane,. And Army strong as one. As they sit back and laugh. The one you left has just begun. A world of hate awaits. We are The Wild Ones. They all look the same. Our time has come. I am the chosen,. Wretched and Divine. I am the unspoken,. The one they left behind. Fearless, fight until we die. I am broken. The Wretched and Divine. We live for broken hearts,. Won't watch them fall apart. We live for the ones. Who don't know they exist. We die for endless winter,. Beginner and the sinner. We die for the ones. Who raise their hands to resist. I am the chosen,. Wretched and Divine. I am the unspoken,. The one they left behind. Fearless, fight until we die. I am broken. The Wretched and Divine"
youth and whisky,"These words are burning inside of me. Spent years in liquid harmony. This dream is who I wanna’ be. Youth and Whisky. I grew from those who hate me. Stead fast to a razorblade symphony. Cigarettes n’ lyrics made me. Youth and Whisky. Can you see?. Can you see me?. I’m strong from what they made me. These Angels who carry me. They taught me. Youth and Whisky. Baptized in smoke and misery. A loaded gun and a bastard’s history. My temple’s for the crazy. Youth and Whisky. No sorrow left inside me. Celebrate the moments behind me. This shot is Holy Mary. Youth and Whisky. Can you see?. Can you see me?. I’m strong from what they made me. These Angel’s who carry me. They taught me. Youth and Whisky. Hey Hey, brothers. Hey Hey, fighters. Bottles living for another round. Hey Hey, lovers. Hey Hey, liars. Throttles speeding towards a black out. Can you see?. Can you see me?. I’m strong from what they made me. These Angel’s who carry me. They taught me. Youth and Whisky. . Créditos: Anny H."
