adrift,Among sheets and broken glass. Stale drinks and old ash. I lie awake trapped in frozen dreams. Longing for the day that I will find peace. The old portrait stares at me. Cheerful eyes bring emptiness. Round the decay it stands pristine. A time when everything was green. I was strong and whole and bright. Then silently came the night. I can't breathe. You reach your hands to me. A glimmer of hope. A mocking smile. You keep dragging me down. There comes a time. You lived for so long you feel safe. But dreams shatter. By a simple twist of fate. There you stand. A ghost refusing to fade away. Green turned into gray. I'll follow you to the grave. Can we be saved from days long gone?. Can we be saved from innocence lost?. I can't breathe. You reach your hands to me. A glimmer of hope. A mocking smile. You keep dragging me down
arkan,"Deep in the woods, lost in the gloom. I start to hear a wondrous tune. The earth rumbles with the thundering drums. The night is banished as the logs burn. Spinning and spiraling up to the sky. Fierce and wild. With smiling faces and glittering eyes. I see them singing and circling the fire. Dance, sweet child, and don't be afraid. Remain and be one with the land. Dance, sweet child, and don't be afraid. This is a place of the gods. As I sift through the ashes. I fail to see what lies beyond the door. We're lost in the mist of knowledge. Forgotten and deserted. Round the gleaming flames I'll wait. Round the gleaming flames I'll face you. Dance, sweet child, and don't be afraid. Remain and be one with the land. Dance, sweet child, and don't be afraid. This is a place of the gods"
caged sun,"The oath must not be broken. The luminous city will stand forever. Built by sacred demand. Granting the wish of the One. River, mountain and sand. Under the watching sun. These are just words. Remnants of shattered dreams. Buried in the dust. One King, one God. He casts His light upon the land. To guide the frail hearts of men. When the disc rests in the distant west. Darkness is a shroud. Everything is still. I can see you. Blessed with the power to lead mankind. They will understand the divine. One folk, one realm. The gift of life in all its forms. Humans, beasts and plants are born. Daybreak fills the earth with life and grace. And we are reborn. Reveling in his warmth. I can see you. Blessed with the power to lead mankind. They will understand the divine. O precious light. Shine bright. The purest gold is sand. Next to your splendor. I was betrayed. The city can't stop its decay. Is it too late?. Will the divine land be destroyed. By the hate of men. Victims of envy and revenge. Witchcraft, credulity. Ignorance and misery. Fear my wrath and despair. I'll erase all your names. Sailing down the Nile. I see a land so pure and serene. Virtuous lore revealed to me. There will be no hunger, war, disease. Shadows fall to earth. The path to light is lost. Men were left alone in dreamless sleep. Truth stays concealed within our souls"
righteous violence,"The king is dead!. We have nothing more to fear. His head's claimed by Fortune's wheel. On the mob's death square. Now is the time for renewal. Don't mourn for the ill-fated despot. His very existence was a crime. Against the freedom of mankind. Mercy for the innocent. Mercy for the weak. The tyrant died. So the nation could live. Fine virtues bloom. On the poisonous branches of truth. Again and yet again. Righteous violence reigns absolute. Blessings to the new ruler. He takes the blood of the gentry. That slowly erodes. The rooted tree of liberty. I bring you a realm o virtue and terror. I bring you justice prompt and severe. It's foolish to trust virtue without fear. Mercy for the innocent. Mercy for the weak. The tyrant died. So the nation could live. Fine virtues bloom. On the poisonous branches of truth. Again and yet again. Righteous violence reigns absolute. Down with the tyrant. Enemy of the people. He didn't stem the flow of blood. Now the stream is filled by his own. Who dares accuse me?. I, who served the cause of equality. Betrayed by false patriots. I spurn this senseless riot. Mercy for the innocent. Mercy for the weak. The tyrant died. So the nation could live. Fine virtues bloom. On the poisonous branches of truth. Again and yet again. Righteous violence reigns absolute. The people gather round. I can hear the rabid crowd. I can feel their anxious eyes. Waiting for me on the other side. Time will judge us all"
same face,"The rays of early light. Show the way to Aurora. Again she opens wide. The golden gates of dawn. I woke up by your side. Struck by fresh beauty. Crowned by the morning breeze. You hide distant eyes. When a new love awakes. With different smells and tastes. Behind the mask I'm afraid. To see the same face. The new day arrives. Another day, not so bright. I say you're unique. You pretend to believe. I'll tell you lame jokes. New stories, tired lies. Buy you fancy roses. Take you to the same old bar. When a new love awakes. With different smells and tastes. Behind the mask I'm afraid. To see the same face. Deep down I search for you. Not one of them seems true. One by one they leave without a trace. You keep leading me astray. A field of golden flowers. Bending to the placid mirroring lake. Drawn by their own beauty. Lost in themselves. Lonely and sad. When a new love awakes. With different smells and tastes. Behind the mask I'm afraid. To see my own face. So the Goddess of Dawn. Carries out her work and brings light to earth. A new day arrives. Nothing but a dream of another day. When a new love awakes. With different smells and tastes. Behind the mask I'm afraid. To see my own"
