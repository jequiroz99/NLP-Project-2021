carnival game,"It was a masquerade at Mardi Gras. That was the only trip that I recall. Everytime I turned around at all. There was you. Some days are easier said than done. Always expecting something's wrong. I'd rather live alone than drag this on. Take your time- please lay your hands on me. Don't wanna be alone, oh no. A mask behind the face and then you're gone. Oh,yeah- comes a time when you're better off alone. You're on your own. I've got a kaleidoscope of memories. Visions of you locked up inside of me. Can't you see. We once collided like a broken wheel. So undecided what was real. Maybe a crash somehow has sex appeal. Whatever turns you on. Take your time- please lay your hands on me. Don't wanna be alone, oh no. A mask behind a face and then you're gone. Oh yeah- comes a time when you're better off alone. One down- one to go. Oh no, playin' in a carnival. Your time is gone. One down- one to go. Oh no, playin' in a carnival. You're all alone. One down- one to go. Oh no, you're on your own"

name of the game,"No one believes me. Someone conceived me. A fluke in the night of obscurity. Played by millions simulcast by a few. A city no lights such a great view. It's all very strange it's the name of the game. (Chorus 1). It's all the same it's never gonna change. It's the name of the game. Over and over and over again. Time after time after time. Over and over and over again. Love is the name of the game. Come around and see me analyze or analogy. I'll give you a clue what you really need. If things get bad then things can get worse. Remember ""Surrender"" remember the verse. It's all very strange it's the name of the game. It's all the same it's never gonna change. It's the name of the game. Over and over and over again. Time after time after time. Over and over and over again. Love is the name of the game. I say hold on tight. Say hey you're doin' it right. As I wish for a full dream flight. Night after night I'm a knight. Over and over and over and over. and over and over again. Time after time after time. Over and over and over and over. Love is the name of the game.
