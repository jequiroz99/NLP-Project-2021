a song for you,"I've been so many places in my life and time. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme. I've acted out my love in stages. With ten thousand people watching. But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you. I know your image of me is what I hope to be. I've treated you unkindly, but darlin' can't you see?. There's no one more important to me. Darlin' can't you please see through me?. Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you. You taught me precious secrets. Of the truth with holding nothing. You came out in front and I was hiding. But now I'm so much better. And if my words don't come together. Listen to the melody. Cause my love is in there hiding. I love you in a place where there's no space or time. I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine. And when my life is over, remember when we were together. We were alone and I was singing this song for you. You taught me precious secrets. Of the truth with holding nothing. You came out in front and I was hiding. But now I'm so much better. And if my words don't come together. Listen to the melody. Cause my love is in there hiding. I love you in a place where there's no space or time. I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine.

close to you - they long to be,Why do birds suddenly appear. Everytime you are near?. Just like me they long to be. Close to you. Why do stars fall down from the sky. Everytime you walk by?. Just like me they long to be. Close to you. On the day that you were born. The angels got together. And decided to create a dream come true. So they sprinkled moondust in your hair. And golden starlight in your eyes. Your eyes of blue. That is why all the girls in town. Follow you all around. Just like me they long to be. Close to you. On the day that you were born. The angels got together. They decided to create a dream come true. So they sprinkled moondust in your hair. Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue. And that is why (why...) all the girls in town.

eventide,Lying under barren skies. The light escaping from my eyes. Below the moon. Walking down the avenue. I'm followed by the afterglow. The velvet rose of evening grows. Weary to be home again. Among the faces of my friends. The day is done. Candles burning by the sea. Are waiting for me patiently. I wish the same. For you

love me for what i am,We fell in love. On the first night that we met. Together we've been happy. I have very few regrets. The ordinary problems. Have not been hard to face. But lately little changes. Have been slowly taking place. You're always finding something. Is wrong in what I do. But you can't rearrange my life. Because it pleases you. You've got lo love me for what I am. For simply being me. Don't love me. For what you intend. Or hope that I will be. And if you're only using me. To feed your fantasy. You're really not in love. So let me go. I must be free. If what you want. Isn't natural for me. I won't pretend to keep you. What I am I have to be. The picture of perfection. Is only in your mind. For all your expectations. Love can never be designed. We either take each other. For everything we are. Or leave the life we've made behind. And make another start. You've got lo love me for what I am. For simply being me. Don't love me. For what you intend. Or hope that I will be. And if you're only using me. To feed your fantasy. You're really not in love. So let me go. I must be free. And if you're only using me. To feed your fantasy. You're really not in love. So let me go. I must be free. You're really not in love. So let me go. I must be free
only yesterday,"After long enough of being alone. Everyone must face their share of loneliness. In my own time nobody knew. The pain I was goin' through. And waitin' was all my heart could do. Hope was all I had until you came. Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me. You were the dawn breaking the night. The promise of morning light. Filling the world surrounding me. When I hold you. Baby, baby. Feels like maybe things will be all right. Baby, baby. Your love's made me. Free as a song singin' forever. Only yesterday when I was sad. And I was lonely. You showed me the way to leave. The past and all its tears behind me. Tomorrow may be even brighter than today. Since I threw my sadness away. Only yesterday. I've found my home here in your arms. Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be. Life waits for us, share it with me. The best is about to be. So much is left for us to see. When I hold you. Baby, baby. Feels like maybe things will be all right. Baby, baby. Your love's made me. Free as a song singin' forever. Only yesterday when I was sad. And I was lonely. You showed me the way to leave. The past and all its tears behind me. Tomorrow may be even brighter than today. Since I threw my sadness away. Only yesterday. Only yesterday!. Only yesterday when I was sad. And I was lonely. You showed me the way to leave. The past and all its tears behind me. Tomorrow may be even brighter than today. Since I threw my sadness away. Only yesterday"

rainy days and mondays,"Talking to myself and feeling old. Sometimes I'd like to quit. Nothing ever seems to fit. Hangin' around, nothing to do but frown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down. What I've got they used to call the blues. Nothing is really wrong. Feeling like I don't belong. Walking around some kind of lonely clown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down. Funny but it seems I always wind up here with you. It's nice to know somebody loves me. Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do. Run and find the one who loves me. What I feel is come and gone before. No need to talk it out. We know what it's all about. Hanging around, nothing to do but frown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down. Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do. Run and find the one who loves me. What I feel is come and gone before. No need to talk it out. We know what it's all about.

solitaire,"There was a man, a lonely man. Who lost his love through his indifference. A heart that cared, that went unshared. Until it died within his silence. And Solitaire's the only game in town. And every road that takes him, takes him down. And by himself, it's easy to pretend. He'll never love again. And keeping to himself he plays the game. Without her love it always ends the same. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing Solitaire. A little hope goes up in smoke. Just how it goes, goes without saying. There was a man, a lonely man. Who would command the hand he's playing. And Solitaire's the only game in town. And every road that takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing Solitaire. And keeping to himself he plays the game. Without her love it always ends the same. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing Solitaire. And Solitaire's the only game in town. And every road that takes him, that takes him down. While life goes on around him everywhere. He's playing Solitaire. He's playing Solitaire"
sometimes,"Sometimes, not often enough. We reflect upon the good things. And those thoughs always center around those we love. And I think about those people. Who mean so much to me.

superstar,"Long ago, and, oh, so far away. I fell in love with you. Before the second show. Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear. But you're not really here. It's just the radio. Don't you remember you told me you love me baby?. You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby. I love you, I really do. Loneliness is such a sad affair. And I can hardly wait. To be with you again. What to say (what to say) to make you come again?. Come back to me again. And play your sad guitar. Don't you remember you told me you love me baby?. You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby. I love you, I really do. Don't you remember you told me you love me baby?.

we've only just begun,"We've only just begun to live. White lace and promises. A kiss for luck and we're on our way. (We've only begun). Before the rising sun we fly. So many roads to choose. We start our walking and learn to run. (And yes, we've just begun). Sharin' horizons that are new to us. Watchin' the signs along the way. Talkin' it over just the two of us. Workin' together day to day. Together. And when the evening comes we smile. So much of life ahead. We'll find a place where there's room to grow. (And yes, we've only just begun).
