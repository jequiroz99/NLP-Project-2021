christmas wrapping,"""Bah, humbug!"" No, that's too strong. 'Cause it is my favorite holiday. But all this year's been a busy blur. Don't think I have the energy. To add to my already mad rush. Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.. The perfect gift for me would be. Completions and connections left from. Last year, ski shop,. Encounter, most interesting.. Had his number but never the time. Most of '81 passed along those lines.. So deck those halls, trim those trees. Raise up cups of Christmas cheer,. I just need to catch my breath,. Christmas by myself this year.. Calendar picture, frozen landscape,. Chilled this room for twenty-four days,. Evergreens, sparkling snow. Get this winter over with!. Flashback to springtime, saw him again,. Would've been good to go for lunch,. Couldn't agree when we were both free,. We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.. Didn't, of course, 'til summertime,. Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?. No, this time it was me,. Sunburn in the third degree.. Now the calendar's just one page. And, of course, I am excited. Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind. Not to do too much about it.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. But I think I'll miss this one this year.. Hardly dashing through the snow. Cause I bundled up too tight. Last minute have-to-do's. A few cards a few calls. 'Cause it's r-s-v-p. No thanks, no party lights. It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax. Turned down all of my invites.. Last fall I had a night to myself,. Same guy called, halloween party,. Waited all night for him to show,. This time his car wouldn't go,. Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late,. Trudge on home to celebrate. In a quiet way, unwind. Doing Christmas right this time.. A&P has provided me. With the world's smallest turkey. Already in the oven, nice and hot. Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?. So on with the boots, back out in the snow. To the only all-night grocery,. When what to my wondering eyes should appear. In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!. ""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said.. ""Need a break; this year's been crazy."". I said, ""Me too, but why are you?. You mean you forgot cranberries too?"". Then suddenly we laughed and laughed. Caught on to what was happening. That Christmas magic's brought this tale. To a very happy ending! "". Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!. Couldn't miss this one this year!"

So let's sink another drink. 'Cause it'll give me time to think. If I had the chance. I'd ask the world to dance. And I'll be dancing with myself. Oh dancing with myself. Oh dancing with myself. Well there's nothing to lose. And there's nothing to prove. I'll be dancing with myself. If I looked all over the world. And there's every type of girl. But your empty eyes. Seem to pass me by. Leave me dancing with myself. So let's sink another drink. 'Cause it'll give me time to think. If I had the chance. I'd ask the world to dance. And I'll be dancing with myself.
