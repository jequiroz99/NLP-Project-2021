rock and roll lullaby,"She was just sixteen and all alone. when I came to be. so we grew up together. My mama child and me. Now things were bad. and she was scared. but whenever I would cry. she'd calm my fears and dry my tears. with that rock'n'roll lullaby. and she'd sing. Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. It will be all right. Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. Let's just hold on tight. Sing it to me mama. My my my my mama. Sing it sweet and clear. sing it sweet and clear. oh, mama let me hear. That old rock'n'roll lullaby. Now we made it through the lonely days. But, Lord, the nights were long. And we'd dream of better mornin's. When mama sang a song. Now I can't recall the words at all. It don't make sense to try. 'Cause I just knew lotsa love came through. In that rock and roll lullaby. And she'd sing. Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na. It'll be all right. Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na. Now just hold on tight. I can hear ya, mama. My, my, my, my mama. Nothin' moves (heals) my soul. Like the sound of the good old. Rock and roll lullaby"
my girl,"I´ve got sunshine on a cloudy day. When it's cold outside. I´ve got the month of May. I guess you'd say. What can make me feel this way. My girl (my girl, my girl). Talking about my girl (my girl). I've got so much honey. The bees envy me. I´ve got a sweeter song. Than the birds in the trees. Well I guess you'd say. What can make me feel this way. My girl (my girl, my girl). Talking about my girl (my girl). Ooooh, Hooooo. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Ooooooooo yeah. I don't need no money fortune or fame. I´ve got all the riches baby.

With my girl. I've even got the month of may. With my girl"
live and let die,When you were young and your heart was an open book. You used to say live and let live. You know you did. You know you did. You know you did. But if this ever-changing world in which we live in. Makes you give in and cry. Say live and let die. Live and let die. Live and let die. Live and let die. What does it matter to you?. When you got a job to do. You got to do it well. You got to give the other fellow hell. You used to say live and let live. You know you did. You know you did. You know you did. But if this ever-changing world in which we live in. Makes you give in and cry. Say live and let die. Live and let die. Live and let die. Live and let die. . Dcmx
bohemian rhapsody,"Is this the real life?. Is this just fantasy?. Caught in a landslide. No escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see. I'm just a poor boy. I need no sympathy. Because I'm easy come, easy go. A little high, little low. Anyway the wind blows. Doesn't really matter to me, to me. Mama, just killed a man. Put a gun against his head. Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. Mama, life had just begun. But now I've gone and thrown it all away. Mama, oh. Didn't mean to make you cry. If I'm not back again this time tomorrow. Carry on, carry on. As if nothing really matters. Too late, my time has come. Sends shivers down my spine. Body's aching all the time. Goodbye everybody, I've got to go. Gotta leave you all behind. And face the truth. Mama, oh, I don't want to die. But sometimes wish I'd never been born at all. I see a little silhouetto of a man. Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the Fandango. Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me. Galileo, Galileo. Galileo, Galileo. Galileo, Figaro, magnifico. I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me. He's just a poor boy from a poor family. Spare him his life from this monstrosity. Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?. Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. Let him go. Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go. Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go. Will not let you go, let me go, never. Never let you go, let me go. Never let me go, oh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go. Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me. For me. For me. So you think. You can stone me and spit in my eye. So you think you can love me. And leave me to die. Oh baby, can't do this to me baby. Just gotta get out. Just gotta get right outta here. Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah. Nothing really matters. Anyone can see. Nothing really matters. Nothing really matters to me. Anyway the wind blows"
cities in dust,"Water was running, children were running. You were running out of time. Under the mountain, a golden fountain. Were you praying at the Lares shrine?. But oh your city lies in dust, my friend. We found you hiding we found you lying. Choking on the dirt and sand. Your former glories and all the stories. Dragged and washed with eager hands. But oh your city lies in dust, my friend. Hot and burning in your nostrils. Pouring down your gaping mouth. Your molten bodies blanket of cinders. Caught in the throes ........ And your city lies in dust"
day after day,"He wants her love. But never took a shower. He loves her badly. But he does not have a dollar. He listens good. Can't understand the words. He wants a better life. But life keeps getting worse. He just cannot remember. Anybody's name. When the situation degenerates. There's no one to blame. He tries to do things right. He knows he never will. 'Cause his favorite son. My friend. Is ""The fool on the hill"""
every breath you take,"Every breath you take. Every move you make. Every bond you break. Every step you take. I'll be watching you. Every single day. Every word you say. Every game you play. Every night you stay. I'll be watching you. Oh can't you see. You belong to me. How my poor heart aches with every step you take. Every move you make. Every vow you break. Every smile you fake. Every claim you stake. I'll be watching you. Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace. I dream at night I can only see your face. I look around, but it's you I can't replace. I feel so cold and I long for your embrace. I keep crying baby, baby please. Oh can't you see. You belong to me. How my poor heart aches with every step you take. Every move you make. And every vow you break. Every smile you fake, every claim you stake. I'll be watching you. Every move you make, every step you take. I'll be watching you. I'll be watching you.

DD#E DD#E BA#A BA#A ( Bm C#m ). Fudido! Fudido! Fudido! Fudido!. E. Listen to the door bell. Pretend you're in a tunnel. Crying as a train goes by. Flying with the Jetsons. Listen to the clock tic-tac. E. Inside of me. F# D E. Day and night.

spaceballs,Running 'cross the universe. They got long hair and they wanna fly. Space: the final frontier. Space: i wanna be here. If they don't have the glory of a war. It's just because they don't believe in war. We got the space that's the final frontier. Space: i wanna be here. Down thru the space we swim on a dream. It sounds like a sound of a song that we can sing!. Down thru the space we swim on a dream. It sounds like a sound of a song that we can sing!

you have to outgrow rock'n roll,"Get what you can and run away. Time's running out, you won't escape. You don't wanna be that kind of fool. The guy who will never act his age. It's not that you have a choice to make. You can't afford another day. Those little things you left undone. Painted your hair with shades of grey. Why don't you settle down. Go raise a family. Then maybe you'll find out. What's left of life to live. Why don't you find a girl. Go for a pair of kids. You want a new guitar. You'd better rest your fists. So it's time when it's time. Then it's time to get old. Gotta choose it: Do it right. Or be out of control. You're part of the landscape now. You have to outgrow rock'n roll. I guess now you get what this is all about. You should be ashamed without a doubt. Go buy yourself some real shoes. No more loud amps, no screams, no shouts"
