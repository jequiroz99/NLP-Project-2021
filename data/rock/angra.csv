rebirth,"Cooling breeze from the summer day. Hearing echoes from your heart. Learning how to recompose the words. Let time just fly. Joyful sea-gulls roaming on the shore. Not a single note will sound. Raise my head after I dry my face. Let time just fly. Recalling, retreating. Returning, retrieving. A small talk you're missing. More clever, but older now. A leader, a learner. A lawful beginner. A lodger of lunacy. So lucid in a jungle. A helper, a sinner. A scarecrow's agonizing smile. Oh Oh! Minutes go round and round. Inside my head. Oh Oh! My chest will now explode. Falling into pieces. Rain breaks on the ground! -blood. One minute forever. A sinner regreting. My vulgar misery ends. (And I) ride the winds of a brand new day. High where mountains stand. Found my hope and pride again. Rebirth of a man. Time to fly..."

anniversary medley,"Stand away the dreaded burning fire. Will leave its mark for those with no desire. Stand in front of the whole creation. Face the people starved like worms. Still I'm begging for comprehension. From the ones who rule us all. In this field the dying embers soil. All around we mourn. Oh, here they come again. The stars can't find the purple sky. Long for the day be back someday. And the church. Don't let us die. Let me rest in peace. Sanity brings up the sadness. that keeps your illusions locked in a little box. Fright comes, you find yourself lonely. in a cage of conclusions crowding your mind. You sit back bowing your head. Every answer - yes. Why don't you trust me and shed out your fears,. Running over the tears you've contained. now cover up your eyes. - Is it good for you?. And I'll be here when fire burns. (Inside your heart). Climb up the hills and mountains,. don't forget what you've learned!. Life makes us feel the time we cannot hold. Time makes us live a tale already told. Time makes us heal a feeling inside. a feeling that lies in our heart. that we stole away.... Time after time. Burned your wings on the sun. Metal Icarus. Night after night. Up on forced unknown. Metal Icarus. Ah! Those were the years. I can still feel the windy heights. Against my skin. And if I close my eyes. I'm flying over hills!. Still stare at my face. But lost seem your eyes. Keep hold of the sails. Against the blue sky. Ooh, I'm intending. A way back to the sea. This emptiness burns inside. And leads on for endless miles. Don't let me go. Away across the sea,. The waves can't be as high. As they pretend to be. And now I know. In my heart, I won't forget. The sails against the blue sky. That taught me how to live. Hear the whispers of your hope. The answer wasn't told. No, don't laugh seeing me cry. The end I've left behind. Make believe. There's no sorrow in your eyes. Can't you see. We could never get back from the start. Minutes waiting, life's been wasted. And I've tried,. Maybe you deny. Words of peace. For the future of our lives. Bring to me. Something else than a broken heart. I won't wait 'till my life is wasted. Maybe I wanna die some other day. Somehow I turn around and see. My nerves break down inside. Maybe you might know much more than me. So tell me what is right to say. Down the weakness of my soul. Lie the secrets, and I know. There's something pushing back. Wish my hands could turn to gold. And my heart would break the cold. To give my thoughts some sense. Under the sun. In a solitary world. I am running alone. Scars on my face. Weary hands from digging dirt. I was dying all alone. Am I running?. Where am I?. Where has everyone gone this time?. Left my future far behind. I am nothing but the sole survivor"
arising thunder,"Time for your reflection. What's the promise you have made?. Destruction of your pride. And reconstruction of my name. You betrayed me where's your bravery?. Now you face your doom. Your fate will be traced by the spear. That went tearing through. When you hear the Winds Of Revenge. All the distance and chains. You put around my damned soul. Right now it's all finished. I'm just building your new world. While you navigate in peace. And glance at lands you will control. Bewitched you cannot see the route. And Hell where you will go. When you hear the winds of revenge. You will see the goddess crying. And the boats will sink and now. you play my secret game. Arising Thunder!. Welcome to me, you fall alone. Stand up and face me in a fight. Drowning in tears deep in the storm. Once again, once again!. Go!. Look out!. When you hear the winds of revenge. You will see the goddess crying.

ashes,"Our revels now are ended. We were actors?. We were spirits?. Melted into air. Now I lift my spell. Forgiveness I embrace. Heaven sent hell away. All my life. As a dream. With opened eyes. I'll restart. I was blind and deaf. Until the day of wakening came. I had faith in evil. In his palace of no blame. All this world around me. I created on my own. And now it's time. To free this island and be gone. All my life like ashes in my hand. I'll forgive and prosper 'till the end. The magic of stars now filling my heart. Like a blaze. Time, now it's time!. Feels like ashes all my life!. I'll restart. I was blind and deaf. Until the day of wakening came. I had faith in evil. In his palace of no blame. All this world around me. I created on my own. And now it's time. To free this island and be gone. Lie at mercy all my enemies. I'll forgive and leave across the sea. We are such a stuff as dreams are made on. Set me free. I'll carry on! Carry on!. This end is my start. We are such stuff as dreams are made on. And I'm gone"
awake from darkness,Out in the dark I roam. Onward to meet my fate. Time's an illusion today. Away from all I know. A frail that is filled with pain. Feeling the lifeless taste ahead. I wish for no more than air. Flashes of clearness cross my eyes. Disclosing power. The tides will hurry my return. Now in the blackness I see light. I will not cower. I contemplate life with helpless faith. Master of my design I am. Awake from darkness. Pages of wisdom turn. Mind over matter reigns. my fear won't lead me astray. I seek the quiet night. Over the crushing waves. I imagine thoughts on golden rays. And days when I'll rise again. Flashes of clearness cross my eyes. Disclosing power. The tides will hurry my return. Now in the blackness I see light. I will not cower. I contemplate life with helpless faith. Master of my design I am. Awake from darkness I am. Awake from darkness. A broken dignity. An upsurge soon to be. Within these books I find my hope. And liberty. Flashes of clearness cross my eyes. Revealing power. The tides will hurry my return. When in the blackness I see light. My soul won't cower. I contemplete life with helpless faith. Staring into a brighter day. I see the fields which once were black. Master of my design I am. Awake from darkness I am. Awake from darkness. CrÃ©dito: Leonardo K'Dash

Logo deixa a Terra. Vai de encontro Ã  sua sina. Onde o cÃ©u encontra o mar. AcharÃ¡ seu porto. E Ã© assim que isso termina..."". All I see floats with the wind. - All the miracles of the water.

Carolina IV took a river to the sky. Seven men on board taking part. To take their hearts around. All around, around the world!. All I can recall that day. On that very day for sure. All hands up against the haze. As we attempted the return. Carolina IV took the river to the sky. One man less on board - human dreams. Have sometimes cost their lives,. All their lives dreaming. I've been such a fool. I've been so afraid. From my heart to you I say:. - I'll be here to stay!. Nothing much left from the boat. Many years have been and gone. Still I can't forget the past. And the ones I left at home. Carolina IV took the river to the sky. Windy whistling nights. Made me sail right into the wind's eye. Now I'll die singing:. I've been such a fool. I've been so afraid.

Crossing the border line. Beyond the knowledge of man. One simple step. A giant leap for mankind. Crossing the border line. The world outside the cave. Reaching the light. The future starts today"

They told me I'd be free someday. Maybe I'll just forget. And someway won't expect. This anger shadowing my nights. Into a nightmlare falling. Somebody keeps me on high.

Laughing, but wishing to cry. Gentle change of tides. Upcoming days. Oh, the spirits of a new horizon fall. Into old dreams. Standing here howling at the storm. Shouting how life could be perfect. Well, then the walls have to fall. To start it again. Gentle change of tides. Upcoming days. Oh, the spirits of a new horizon fall. Into old dreams. Far away from sights. Oh, hidden in the haze. Oh, oh, spirits of a new horizon fall. Into old dreams"

petrified eyes,"We're armed and ready to attack. To strike the city of all desires. Then calm the waves that lead to passion. When all reality turns back to ashes. Over the hills, across the sea. Into the abyss of a bygone time. Lest we forget what really matters. And the bewildered look up to the sky. Fallen comrades lay on the ground. Victors in death they make no sound. Petrified my eyes. Behold the sights of battle lost. In this unchanging world. What does the poor life of a warrior cost?. Oh can't you see. Many faces from God's own races are waiting. To fight the good fight. Even though the annals of time. have passed you by you still don't see. Oh, you won't see. They've petrified your eyes. Deep desires of mine. Dark thoughts tyrannize my mind. When will this torture end. Into the mire, to battle again"

rainy nights,"Rainy nights can easily go. The morning sun, a lover so. A cup of tea still held tight in her hand. And tomorrow'll be just like yesterday. Taken by promises. She's just begun to feel the heat. From the fire, and so. Crazy thoughts out of control. Somewhere else away from home. An angels's kiss, the fresh breeze on her face. Closed her eyes and walked into the haze. - And fade away. Taken by promises. She's just begun to feel the heat. From the fire. Burning herself and her soul. - Fade away, fade away. Scenes from yesterday, seem so far away. 'Till the day they'll return again. Taken by promises. She's just begun to feel the heat. From the fire. Burning herself and her soul. So understand, my friend. Sometimes there's rain,. Sometimes there's breeze. Fanning the fire, and so. ...Burns herself back to dust. Brings the hope and the love. Sews the ends of the hope. Gets us further somehow. Away from home and from all. Thoughts dancing out of control. Turning the stones into gold. Leading to planets unknown. Blowing the fire and so. I promise I won't let you go"
reaching horizons,"Rainy clouds. Covered up the sunny sky. Now I know i'll sleep alone tonight. Tears and prayers will be taken by the rain. Fearing lonelyness in my dreams. Now I know i'll never be the same. Living this tragedy, insane,. All I wanna be. Is to be free with you, with me. I don't blame the fate. But it's too hard to face the truth. It was all just like paradise. Just like we wanted it to be. Far beyond the reason. Rest our lives. Eternity denies the guilt of reality. Senselesness. Fly high, reaching skies. Two eagles flying to be free. Moments of madness. Will be left behind. The same horizon. But in different lands"
rebirth,"Cooling breeze from the summer day. Hearing echoes from your heart. Learning how to recompose the words. Let time just fly. Joyful sea-gulls roaming on the shore. Not a single note will sound. Raise my head after I dry my face. Let time just fly. Recalling, retreating. Returning, retrieving. A small talk you're missing. More clever, but older now. A leader, a learner. A lawful beginner. A lodger of lunacy. So lucid in a jungle. A helper, a sinner. A scarecrow's agonizing smile. Oh Oh! Minutes go round and round. Inside my head. Oh Oh! My chest will now explode. Falling into pieces. Rain breaks on the ground! -blood. One minute forever. A sinner regreting. My vulgar misery ends. (And I) ride the winds of a brand new day. High where mountains stand. Found my hope and pride again. Rebirth of a man. Time to fly..."

shape of my heart,He deals the cards as a meditation. And those he plays never suspect. He doesn't play for the money he wins. He doesn't play for respect. He deals the cards to find the answer. The sacred geometry of chance. The hidden law of a probable outcome. The numbers lead a dance. I know that the spades are swords of a soldier. I know that the clubs are weapons of war. I know that diamonds mean money for this art. But that's not the shape of my heart. He may play the jack of diamonds. He may lay the queen of spades. He may conceal a king in his hand.

But that's not the shape of my heart. And if I told you that I loved you. You'd maybe think there's something wrong. I'm not a man of too many faces. The mask I wear is one. Those who speak know nothing. And find out to their cost. Like those who curse their luck in too many places. And those who fear are lost. I know that the spades are swords of a soldier. I know that the clubs are weapons of war. I know that diamonds mean money for this art. But that's not the shape of my heart. But that's not the shape of my heart.

Than what it seems to be. Ooh, I'm still searching. The way back to be freed. The loneliness hangs around us. However we can't see. Now let me go. Away across the sea,. The waves can't be as high. As they pretend to be. And now I know. In my heart, I won't forget. The sails against the blue sky. That taught me how to live. ... with no sorrow. And tomorrow we'll share. Silence and distance.

Ends the Holy War. Have the good for bad.. (What does a man gain from his work?. Under the sun where he labors. What is so good for a man in life?. During his days he's just like a shadow. Vanitas! Vanitas! Utters the oracle. A chasing after the wind. Meaningless! Meaningless searches for wisdom. Everything is in vain like your hunting for shadows). Lost my pride, fought in vain. Had to find reasons to my pain - Down!. Running blind against the faith. Running blind again. Church is falling like castles on the sand. Ends the Holy War. Jesus was a man. With a heart, with a mind. With a body, with a soul. So divine as your own. God has no mind, has no heart. Has no body, has no soul and no resemblance of you.. No!. (Like chasing the wind...)"

the temple of hate,Nations battle on the field across the lands. Ruthless - stealing territories from our hands. Anger throwing down the victims to the ground. Cold blood younger soldiers weeping with no sound. Revolution striking down right now!. Blind fools fighting for the power to command. Flag poles threading down the freedom of our men. Innocence dying by the fury of the sword. Poor men falling before saying their last words. Revelation code XI. Striking over us. Sounds of revolution. Freedom is proclaimed. Bells announcing changes for the better. in the temple of hate. The Temple of Hate!. The Temple of Hate!. Satan awaits!. Revolution we have waited. Burning down our souls. Sounds of revolution. Freedom is proclaimed. Bells announcing changes for the better. in the temple of hate. Satan awaits!. The Temple of Hate!. Ohhh! Ohhh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohhhhh! Ohhh!
the voice commanding you,"War games inside your brain. You got to fight alone. Falling back, your sanity has gone. Whyâd you ever think that you could run away from pain?. Sorry man, your tries were all in vain. Wandering âround like a phantom in the dark. And youâre waiting for the night to come. Lunacy attacks and you struggle to hit back. Youâll be waiting for the morning sun. Iâm the voice commanding you. Divided weâre nothing â united weâre breaking the rules. Iâm the voice commanding you. Someday the madness will loose controlâ¦ over you. Dreaming on, you can fly in a never-ending story. Where the sun will shine every passing day. Free your mind, let your spirit go free into the night. Let the minutes be gone and fly away. Coming in and out the confusions in your mind. Going crazy as the night moves on. Playing with your head now youâre wishing to be dead. And youâre praying for the dawn to come. Iâm the voice commanding you. Divided weâre nothing â united weâre breaking the rules. Iâm the voice commanding you. Donât let the madness assume control. Over you, over you, over you. Iâll be there reminding who you are. All the time with no escape. You look inside the voice is calling you. Take your chance itâs never late. Iâm the voice commanding you. Laying down the law. Divided weâre nothing â united weâre breaking the rules. Iâm the voice commanding you. Canât make me go awayâ¦ Iâm over you. I will never surrender. Iâm commanding you. Laying down the law over you. A border line. That you canât hide. The voice commanding you. . (fonte: site oficial)"
time,"This time I wanna know what life means.... ... to live it again. I'm looking forward, feel the light shine in my eyes. And now I know, my instincts were not wrong. And many things can be done. I don't believe now. That I'm dreaming alone. Oh, we're searching for the love. That everyone's got, but can't see. Oh, beyond the flesh and blood. There's so much hidden behind. As so much more we've gotta give.... Sanity brings up the sadness. That keeps your illusions locked in a little box. Fright comes, you find yourself lonely. In a cage of conclusions crowding your mind. You sit back bowing your head. Every answer - yes. Why don't you trust me and shed out your fears,. Running over the tears you've contained. Now cover up your eyes. - Is it good for you?. I will be here when fire burns!. Welcome on board. over here is the ship of your life. So rotten that will cast away. I'll be your sweet lullaby all the night. And if you get lost you can hold my hand.... And I'll be here when fire burns. (Inside your heart). Climb up the hills and mountains,. Don't forget what you've learned!. Life makes us feel the time we cannot hold. Time makes us live a tale already told. Time makes us heal a feeling inside. A feeling that lies in our heart. That we stole away.... And I'll be here when fire burns. (Inside your heart). Climb up the hills and mountains,. Don't forget what you've learned!. Life makes us feel (life makes us feel). The time we cannot hold. Time makes us live (time makes us live). A tale already told. Time makes us heal (time makes us heal). A feeling inside. A feeling that lies in our heart.

unfinished allegro,Unfinished Allegro. [Instrumental]
unholy wars,"A lethal bolt pierces the air. Like a falling star. Young eyes are observing in the darkness. His stare's reflecting fright. And scared he's struggling hard. To go back. Uneasy warders guard. The jail on quiet nights. Young eyes contemplating somewhere to hide. Mankind will soon learn. That the end has come in time. Dividing lands, retracing. All the borders will colide. Revealing ages when the absence. Of forgiveness rules our lives. Home how I go. My badge is wearing out. Written on the sand. Words to reconcile - unholy wars. Forgive us our father. For we have sinned. Blinded by pride. We know not what we do. Thy kingdom will be done. By holy wars. The battle is over. But the war still rages on!. Dividing lands, retracing. All the borders will colide. Revealing ages when the absence. Of forgiveness rules our lives. Home how I go. My badge is wearing out. Written on the sand. Words to reconcile - unholy wars"
upper levels,"You've been there for so long. Have you found all the choices you have?. Once you know what to do. Have your thoughts on the way you behave. Open your eyes now. Don't be afraid. Find the connection knowing yours and others' fate. Call it divine or call it insane. I say life is flowing much beyond your veins. Take the best that you have. Realize that your talents are there. What you aim for so much. Tell me, why do you want it so bad?. Open your eyes now. Don't be afraid. Find the connection knowing yours and others' fate. Call it divine or call it insane. I say life is flowing much beyond your veins. The farther the star. The tinier the grain of sand. They came from the same start. And will be led towards the same end. What's the image of you?. Exactly how do you picture yourself?. Open your eyes now. Don't be afraid. Find the connection knowing yours and others' fate. Call it divine or call it insane. I say life is flowing much beyond your veins. Much beyond the time, far beyond the space. Something you can feel within but never understand"
violet sky,"You always come to me, moaning through the years. About your past. And strange as it may seem, it never came to you. The way ahead. Fears you try to hide, hurting deep inside. You can't deny the past!. Tears of a violet sky. Lost in the fallen rain. Seasons pass me by, the everlasting circle. A wicked plan. Is it the destiny? Was it meant to be?. It will not matter anymore. Please, it's time to break the chains. The past you cannot change. Time to let it go. Things you try to hide, hurting deep inside. You have to leave behind!. Tears of a violet sky. Lost in the fallen rain. Dead roses hear my cry. Flowing in vain. Fears you try to hide, burning deep inside. You can't deny the past!. Rinnega il tuo passato. Risplendi nell' oscuritÃ¡. Stella senza etÃ¡. Riflessi di passioni. Celate tra le tenebre. Raggio di luce"
visions prelude,"Cold wind, sad moonrise. Dark clouds in the sky. Storm ends the mourning time. Howling in the night. Vision of the land. After the horrid end. We build again from the start. Holy lenient heart. A treasure of the land. Torments have brought the end. We build again from the start. Holy lenient heart. Vision of the land. After the horrid end. We build again from the start. Holy lenient heart. A treasure of the land. Torments have brought the end. We build again from the start. Holy lenient heart. Visions come from the sea. Oceans bring to me. I reach the sand with a kiss. Treasures bristling from a bliss"
waiting silence,Caught in space and time. Like a bird in a cage. Cruelly confined. In a passing matters state. You suddenly realize. That the wrong is the right. Daring the laws. Ready to put up a fight. But.... Love will drag your heart away. To a world where dreams are made. Can't hide away. When your helpless mind obeys. Together we wait in silence. (Still are the cries). Forever the fate is hungry. for your soul. Together we wait in silence. (Still are the cries). Worth your while until you're gone. All the secrets of life reveal. To my eyes I can't conceal. And again I fly away. To a world where dreams are made. Together we wait in silence. (Still are the cries). Forever the fate is hungry. for your soul. Together we wait in silence. (Still are the cries). Worth your while until you're gone. Life's too short to grieve in sorrow. (Still are the cries). Fate is waiting for your soul. (Secrets inside). Live your life like no tomorrow. (Still are the cries). Worth you're while until gone. Fate's gonna take your soul!
war horns,"Trumpets cry warnings from heaven. ""The virgin dressed with the sun. With the moon on her feet. On her head a garland of twelve stars. Then, being with a child she cries. for the birth of a King"" - Apocalypse 12: 1. War Horns the sign of the times. Break through the silent cries. Petrified, I'm facing the rapture. Choking on tears, the prophecy fulfills. The angels arise announcing the gathering. The wages of sin are for all who live to see. War Horns the sign of the times. Break through the silent cries. Visions from prophets unveiled. All burns in the lake of fire. ""Fire will be raining from the sky. The sun will be darkened. The moon will not give its light. The stars will fall. And the powers of heaven are shaken. That's when the Son of Man. Will arise in the clouds"" - Matthew 24-29. War Horns the sign of the times. Break through our silent cries. Visions from prophets unveil. All burns in the lake of fire"
wasted years,"From the coast of gold, across the seven seas. I'm travellin' on, far and wide. But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself. And all the things I sometimes do,. it isn't me but someone else. I close my eyes, and think of home. Another city goes by in the night. Ain't it funny how it is,. you never miss it 'til it's gone away. And my heart is lying there. and will be 'til my dying day. So understand. Don't waste your time always searching. for those wasted years. Face up... make your stand. And realise you're living in the golden years. Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind.

weakness of a man,"By the shore, on an island. I can hear, our sea of sorrow. With no harm with no disgrace. I am planting the seeds of tomorrow. In my circle I will reign. I was left behind betrayed,. Oh yeah!. Dark backward, abyss of time. Right in front of my eyes. Evil nature destroyed my trust. All their scheming will end up as dust. In my circle I will reign. I will rise against my enemies. Now come away to your master. Bring throught the air all your magic. I'll bless and curse you till the end. Set your whole self aflame. Foolish visions in my angry dreams. Bringing vengeance to my shore. Now my wisdom shows a different scene. There is not love for us all.. All this time my mind was in the past. Furious footprints in this sand. Now living has revealed at last. All the weakness of a man. Turbulent tides. All the waters seem so rough. Keep your faith because the calm will return. I've been longing for this tide to turn. Bringing vengeance to my shore. Time has passed and this is what I've learned. There is not love for us all. All this time my mind was in the past. Angry footprints in this sand. Now living has revealed at last. All the weakness of a man"
