long way home,"3 am and sleep must be the last thing on my mind. how did it get so late so fast, it still feels like last night. thinking about that sunrise as i turn the keys and drive. thinking about the last time that i really felt alive. staring blankly at that road that stretches far ahead. i dont know when ill get back, or when i even left. think of lines and dreams and drives and hives that i just met. all along my eyes they burn while dreaming of my bed. and its a long way home. another long day gone. oh wont you take me home. won't ya. morning strums the chaos dies and still i feel a mix. i cant recall what home feels like or if it still exists. and this long drive is suicide that never finishes. think of life through every mile and i still mell her skin. now im losing track of time in here the suns about to rise. thinking how these moments are the soundtracks to our lives. and i cant wait to taste the air of california skies. take me home to all my own, the home that i cant find. and its a long way home. another long day gone. oh wont you take me home. take me home. Running back into that place from where i ran away. breathing every moment in that soon the time will take. think of all the scars; the stars; the hearts i had to break. one day i will find the time i never had to take. and its a long way home. another long day gone. x4. oh wont you take me home"
next best thing,"Lying beside you in a dream. and I guess I'm okay. whatever that means. toss and turn endlessly. and I just can't wait till I fall asleep. then I'll have you right. where I always wanted you to be. here with me. and it's the same song, I wanna feel something. when I'm tangled inside of your arms. and I will take any high now just to get me through. it's the next best thing to you. dying to find what this means. but I just can't face reality. I think I'm leaving this scene. oh I hate this place but I just can't leave. and into the night. will I ever fall asleep?. I'm in too deep. and it's the same song, I wanna feel something. when I'm tangled inside of your arms. and I will take any high now just to get me through. it's the next best thing to you. now I'm wasting my time having you on my mind. and I'll take any high just to feel alive. like I did with you"
no more words,"I got a sharp stick, I keep in my pocket. I speak volumes, never utter a word. When you strike a match, a fire will happen. But the line between the smoke and the flames get blurred. Don't you see the writing on the wall(Don't you see the writing on the wall). You're in way over your head. You're gonna drown in the things that you said. Time has come and gone for words. A thousands threats I've heard before. But words are cheap, but lies are big to take. Time has come and gone for words. A thousands threats I've heard before. And all your words are too big to take. It's a paradox, A mystery, A riddle. A door in your face and only I have the key. Do understand, you'll be caught in the middle. Caught in a web by being spun by me. Don't you see the writing on the wall(Don't you see the writing on the wall). Just a victim of your own conceit. The architect of your own defeat. Time has come and gone for words. A thousands threats I've heard before. But words are cheap, but lies are big to take. Time has come and gone for words. A thousands threats I've heard before. And all your words are too big to take. Never walk away from a fight that's worth fighting. Never hesitate when you know you're gonna act. Never waste your words on a fool who won't listen. Never sell your soul, 'cause you'll never buy it...back. Time has come and gone for words. A thousands threats I've heard before. But words are cheap, but lies are big to take. Time has come and gone for words. A thousands threats I've heard before. And all your words are too big to take. Time has come and gone for words. A thousands threats I've heard before. But words are cheap, but lies are big to take. Time has come and gone for words. A thousands threats I've heard before. And all your words are too big to take"
poison,"I swore that I'd never do it again. But I surrender all my will to all the psilocybin. Dropped caps and stems with all of my friends. And so went down the hardest trip I've ever been in. I'm climbing walls. Life without a safety net to break all my falls. I wanna know how much poison. Can I take before a tag's on my toe?. Welcome to your mind the most dangerous place. You've ever been you little graceful disgrace. Now everything is taking different shapes. But I can't sleep till the morning, pray to God that I make it. I'm climbing walls. Life without a safety net to break all my falls. I wanna know how much poison. Can I take before a tag's on my toe?. I'm climbing walls. Life without a safety net to break all my falls. I wanna know how much poison. Can I take before a tag's on my toe?. Where did I go? How do I know?. I'm all alone, where did everybody go?"
road to destruction,"As I close my eyes I just don't feel myself. I speak in foreign tongue in the voice of someone else. And I've been a sinner baby, with no soul left to soul. I've got a love for lust and a lusty thirst to kill. Look at the blood on my hands now. There's not a breath left to breathe. This is the road to destruction. That I never can leave. It's passion that I crave. And this time he's taking over and everyone gets slain. And I am a killer baby, a sinner and a saint. I've got a thirst for war and a will to dominate. And now the war is upon us. Are you ready to bleed. This is the road to destruction. And no one gets to leave. Oh this will only lead to whatever ability. And you'll practice your demise as hard as the air you breathe. Something about the way I do when I hear you scream. Is it wrong, it turns me on and haunts me in my dreams. Aren't we having fun ?. On the road to destruction. Aren't we having fun ?. On the road to destruction. Baby here we come. I just can't seem to shake all this hate inside of me. And it burns, it twists and turns, in the face of my enemies. Now is the bloodstain play of a ruthless liberty. So before your one last breath, oh baby let me hear you scream. Aren't we having fun ?. On the road to destruction. Nowhere you can run. On the road to destruction. Baby here we come. Road to destruction. Aren't we having fun ?. On the road to destruction. Nowhere you can run. On the road to destruction. Turn it deep in time"

tip of my tongue,"I've been asleep for far too long. and in my dreams you sang this song. you had the hottest red dress on. I only want for you to stay. I know I'll lose you when I wake. Alarms will sound and now you're gone. Wake up a little older. get back move it closer. I shout ""Baby please just let me out"". I feel you creep into my bones. every time I wake up alone. you feel so sweet inside my lungs. taste it on the tip of my tongue. My desire set ablaze. in the wake of my mistakes. inside the calm before the storm. I confess I lose control. You're all that I've never known. for this I'll reap what I have sewn. Wake up a little older. get back move it closer. I shout ""Baby please just let me out"". I feel you creep into my bones. every time I wake up alone. you feel so sweet inside my lungs. taste it on the tip of my tongue. and I'll inhale you deep. until I'm in the arms of sleep. to greet you in the light. [Instrumental / Guitar Solo]. I feel you creep into my bones. every time I wake up alone. you feel so sweet inside my lungs. taste it on the tip of my tongue. I feel you creep into my bones. every time I wake up alone. you feel so sweet inside my lungs. taste it on the tip of my tongue. taste it on the tip of my tongue. taste it on the tip of my tongue. taste it on the tip of my tongue"
