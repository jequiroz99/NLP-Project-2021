sunseed,You were born at the ending. As the curtain came down. I can see you're confused girl but it's all right. It's only the chimes. Announcing a new time. You see now. Boats are cruising the deserts. Oceans cracked by the heat. People drowning in raindrops. But it's all right. It's not a defeat. Stand on your feet. Right now the sun doesn't shine. He's loaded on wine. Though I can laugh in the storm. Because I was born. When the sun used to. Shine in June

wee wee hours,"In the wee, wee hours. That's when I think of you. In the wee, wee hours. That's when I think of you. You say, but yet I wonder. If your love was ever true. In a wee little room. I sit alone and think of you. In a wee little room. I sit alone and think of you. I wonder if you still remember. All the things we used to do. One little song. For a fading memory. One little song. For a fading memory. Of the one I really love. The only one for me"
white wings - asa branca,"When I stare the ground of. My land. Burning loose as dancing flames. I asked the man there. Up in he heavens. If I deserve me this kind of pain. I asked the man there. Up in he heavens. If I deserve me this kind of pain. Everywhere the ground is so dry. No trees, no green, just grey. Lost my cattle, my appaloosa. For lack of water some took away. I lost my cattle, my appaloosa. For lack of water some took away. Even white winged birds flew away. Flew away from my land sight. It was when I said goodbye. Sweet rosie. Keep in to your heart, this heart of mine. It was when I said goodbye. Sweet rosie. Keep in to your heart, this heart of mine. Many thousands miles away, now. Feeling lonely, lost and blue. I keep on waiting rain falls again there. So I'll be back thou home again. I keep on waiting rain falls again there. So I can go back thou home again. When the glow green of your eyes. Flows again all over land. I can assure you, so don't. You cry, no. 'cause I'll be back, see. To you again!!. I can assure you, so don't. You cry, no. 'cause I'll be back, see. To you again!!"
