bohemian rhapsody,"Is this the real life?. Is this just fantasy?. Caught in a landslide. No escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see. I'm just a poor boy. I need no sympathy. Because I'm easy come, easy go. A little high, little low. Anyway the wind blows. Doesn't really matter to me. To me. Mama, just killed a man. Put a gun against his head. Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. Mama, life had just begun. But now I've gone and thrown it all away. Mama, oh!. Didn't mean to make you cry. If I'm not back again this time tomorrow. Carry on, carry on. As if nothing really matters. Too late, my time has come. Sends shivers down my spine. Body's aching all the time. Goodbye everybody, I've got to go. Gotta leave you all behind. And face the truth. Mama, oh!. (Anyway the wind blows). I don't want to die. But sometimes wish. I'd never been born at all. I see a little silhouette of a man. Scaramouche, Scaramouche. Will you do the Fandango?. Thunderbolt and lightning. Very, very frightening me. Galileo. Galileo. Galileo. Galileo. Galileo, Figaro. Magnifico!. I'm just a poor boy. And nobody loves me. He's just a poor boy. From a poor family. Spare him his life from this monstruosity. Easy come, easy go. Will you let me go?. Bismillah!. No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!). Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!). Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!). Will not let you go. (Let me go!). Never, never let you go. (Let me go!). Never let me go, oh!. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh mama mia, mama mia. Mama mia let me go. Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me. For me, for me. So you think you can stone me. And spit in my eye. So you think you can love me. And leave me to die. Oh baby, can't do this to me baby. Just gotta get out. Just gotta get right outta here. Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah!. Nothing really matters. Anyone can see. Nothing really matters. Nothing really matters to me. (Anyway the wind blows)"

The days were endless we were crazy we were young. The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun. Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know. The rest of my life's been just a show. Those were the days of our lives. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing is true. When I look and I find I still love you. You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide. Ain't that a shame. I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride. When life was just a game. No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did. When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids. Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know. Better sit back and go with the flow. Cos these are the days of our lives. They've flown in the swiftness of time. These days are all gone now but some things remain. When I look and I find no change. Those were the days of our lives - yeah. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true. When I look and I find. I still love you. I still love you.

It's only fools they make these rules. Don't try so hard. One day you'll be a sergeant major. Oh you'll be so proud. Screaming out your bloody orders. Hey but not too loud.

driven by you,"Words and music by Brian May. Oh - everything I do I do for you. Oh yeah. We touch and you're afraid of me and. We burn and now I'm at your feet. High speed,but you know you're in safe hands. In the dark we make a brighter light. From one spark to the horizon wide. We trust and together we tame the land - yeah. You'd be forgiven if you think you're dreaming. But we're working night and day to make a dream come true. - yeah. Everything I do is driven by you. Oh - come on babe. Oh well it's tough to make a journey through. The right stuff is dead ahead of you and me. And you know we've still got time. Hold on tight to the driving wheel. This ride is really out of line. Raw deal, but there's no other that's worth a dime. You know I love you but you drive me crazy. 'Cos you're saying all the things I want to say to you. You say. Everything I do is driven by you.

drowse,"It's the sad-eyed, goodbye, yesterday moments I remember. It's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings I recall. It's the mistier mist. The hazier days. The brighter sun. And the easier lays. There's all the more reason for laughing and crying. When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all. It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays. That bored you to rages of tears. The unending pleading, to waste all your good times. In thoughts of your middle aged years. It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told. For the everyday hero it all turns to zero. And there's all the more reason for living or dying. When you're young and your troubles are all very small. Out here on the street. We'd gather and meet. And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet. And half of the time. We'd broaden our minds. More in the poolhall than we did in the schoolhall. With the downtown chewing-gum bums. Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun. Never wanted to be the boy next door. Always thought I'd be something more. But it ain't easy for a smalltown boy. It ain't easy at all. Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong. It's easier from an armchair. Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness. Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess. I think I'll be Clint Eastwood. Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he looks good. Let's try William The Conqueror. Now who else do I like?"
earth,Words and music by Tim Staffell. I might be at a table. And suddenly I'll catch. A fleeting vision of her crystal seas. Or I might be standing in a crowded dockyard faraway. Underneath the sun I've never seen. 'Cos I have seen many worlds. For what it's worth. But I'll never see again the planet earth. My earth. I might be chasing waves of light. Out towards the rim. Where stars are sparse. And the cold of space seeps in. But I might be in a bar room. Drinking methylated gin. And thinking of the places I have been. Yes I have seen many worlds. For what it's worth. But I'll never see again the planet earth. My earth. I have seen many worlds. For what it's worth. But I'll never see again the planet earth. My earth. Cast adrift amongst the stars. I float from sun to sun. Dreaming of the world that gave me birth. All the places I have been. Remind me there is none. To match the green living hills of earth. 'Cos I have seen many worlds. For what it's worth. But I'll never see again the planet earth

going back,Words and music by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. I think I'm going back. To the things I learnt so well in my youth. I think I'm returning to. Those days when I was young enough to know the truth. Now there are no games. To only pass the time. No more colouring books. No Christmas bells to chime. But thinking young and growing older is no sin. And I can't play the game of life to win. I can recall a time. When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend. And now I think I've got. A lot more than just my toys to lend. Now there's more to do. Than watch my sailboat glide. And every day can be. My magic carpet ride. And I can play hide and seek with my fears. And live my days instead of counting my years. Then everyone debates. The true reality. I'd rather see the world. The way it used to be. A little bit of freedom's all we lack. So catch me if you can. I'm goin' back
good company,Words and music by Brian May. Take good care of what you've got. My father said to me. As he puffed his pipe and baby B. He dandled on his knee. Don't fool with fools who'll turn away.

My wife and I our needs and nothing more. All my friends by a year by and by disappeared. But we're safe enough behind our door. I flourished in my humble trade my reputation grew. The work devoured my waking hours but when my time. was through. Reward of all my efforts. My own Limited Company. I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company. All through the years in the end it appears. There was never really anyone but me. Now I'm old I puff my pipe but no one's there to see. I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity. Take care of those you call your own.

Just surrender and it won't hurt at all. You just got time to say your prayers. While you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall."

hijack my heart,Words and music by Queen. Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day. Just minding my business thinking my thoughts. Nothing much to say. When suddenly I got hit. Imagine my suprise. Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes. I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile. I'd never seen anything that came within miles. My heart got hijacked by you. Stuck in the traffic. Stuck at the lights what do I see. Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me. She takes off. Imagine my disgust. Like a bat out of hell. I get to eat her dust. I never had known anything to compare with her laugh. I'd never known anything that counted by half. My heart got hijacked by you. Hijack my heart. Hijack my heart. Steals my heart. Hijack my heart. Hijack my heart. Look at the cities. Look at the streets what do you see. Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be. Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose. It comes out of nowhere. Right out of the blue. I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile. I'd never seen anything that came within miles. My heart got hijacked by you. Hijack my heart. Now you really got a hold on me. You hijacked my heart. Don't you know you won't let me be. Stole my heart. Threw away the key. Oooee baby what's become of me. You hijacked my heart. Now you really got a hold on me. Hijack my heart.

my fairy king,Words and music by Freddie Mercury. In the land where horses born with eagle wings. And honey bees have lost their stings. There's singing forever. Lions den with fallow deer. And rivers made from wines so clear. Flow on and on forever. Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air. And baby lambs where Samson dares. To go on on on on on on. My fairy king can see things. He rules the air and turns the tides. That are not there for you and me. Ooh yeah he guides the winds. My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong. Then came man to savage in the night. To run like thieves and to kill like knives. To take away the power from the magic hand. To bring about the ruin of the promised land. They turn the milk into sour. Like the blue in the blood of my veins. Why can't you see it. Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming rain. Son of heaven set me free and let me go. Sea turn dry no salt from sand. Seasons fly no helping hand. Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes. Someone someone just drained the colour from my wings. Broken my fairy circle ring. And shamed the king in all his pride. Changed the wings and wronged the tides. Mother mercury mercury. Look what they've done to me. I cannot run. I cannot hide

polar bear,"In the bright shop window sits the polar bear. Makes the children's eyes light up to see him there. Amongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile. To see him as you'd see a star. Love him from where you are. He's not for, not for, not for sale. Past an open window walks the pretty girl. Does she see me at her feet it's hard to tell. But if I ask her she might turn her smile away. To see her as I'd see a star. Love her from where you are. She's not for, not for, not for sale. I guess I'll learn to look. Without a grasping hand. Minor contentment wears a smile. I love her from where I lie. He's not for,not for,not for sale"

It's the same situation just cuts like a knife. When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy. Young and you're crazy.... Oh give me a good guitar. And you can say that my hair's a disgrace. Or just find me an open car.

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life. Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive. Let me tell you all about it-. And the world will so allow it. Ooh, give me a little time to choose. Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight. Blue powder monkies praying in the dead of night. Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile. Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file. Take this, take that, bring them down to size. Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys. A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil. Black on, black on every finger nail and toe. We've only begun, begun. Make this, make that, keep making all that noise. Now I've got a belly-full. You can be my sugar-baby. You can be my honey-chile, yes. A voice from behind me reminds me. Spread out your wings, you are an angel. Remember to deliver with the speed of light. A little bit of love and joy. Everything you do bears a will and a why. and a wherefore. A little bit of love and joy. In each and every soul lies a man. And very soon he'll deceive and discover. But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love. I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right. I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night. I've got the power-. Now do the march of the black queen. My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie. I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like. I'll be your bad boy - I'll be your bad boy. I'll do the march of the Black Queen. Walking true to style. She's vulgar 'buse and vile. Fie-Fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies. She boils, and she bakes, and she never dots her Is. Forget your sing-alongs and your lullabies. Surrender to the city of the fireflies. Dance with the devil in beat with the band. To hell with all of you hand-in-hand. But now it's time to be gone forever"

the prophet's song,Words and music by brian may. Oh oh people of the earth. Listen to the warning the seer he said. Beware the storm that gathers here. Listen to the wise man. I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair. Spreading his hand to the multitude there. A man who cried for a love gone stale. And ice cold hearts of charity bare. I watched as fear took the old man's gaze. Hopes of the young in troubled graves. 'I see no day' I heard him say. So grey is the face of every mortal. Oh oh people of the earth!. 'listen to the warning' the prophet he said. For soon the cold of night will fall. Summoned by your own hand. Ah ah children of the land. Quicken to the new life take my hand. Fly and find the new green bough. Return like the white dove. He told of death as a bone white haze. Taking the lost and the unloved babes. Late too late all the wretches run. These kings of beasts now counting their days. From mother's love is the son estranged. Married his own his precious gain. The earth will shake in two will break. And death all round will be your dowry. Oh oh people of the earth. Listen to the warning the seer he said. For those who hear and mark my words. Listen to the good plan. Oh oh oh oh and two by two my human zoo. They'll be running for to come. Running for to come out of the rain. Oh flee for your lives who heed me not. Let all your treasures make you fear for your life. Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you. Should death await you. Ah people can you hear me?. And now I know and now I know. And now I know and now I know. That you can hear me. And now I know and now I know. And now I know now I know. Now I know now I know. Now I know now I know. Now I know. The earth will shake in two will break. Death all around around around around. Around around around around. Now I know now I know. Now I know now I know. Now I know now I know. Now I know now I know. Now I know now I know. Now I know. Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo. Listen to the wise listen to the wise listen to the wise. Listen to the wise listen to the wise man. La la. La la la la la la. La la la la la la. La la la la la la. La la la la la la. La la la la la la. La la la la la la. La la. La la. La la. Come here I hear you. Come here I hear you. Come here I hear you. Ah ah ah ah ah. Listen to the man listen to the man listen to the man listen. To the mad man. God gave you grace to purge this place. And peace all around may be your fortune. Oh oh children of the land. Love is still the answer take my hand. The vision fades a voice I hear. Listen to the madman!. But still I fear and still I dare not. Laugh at the madman!

there must be more to life than this (feat. michael jackson),There must be more to life than this. There must be more to life than this. How do we cope in a world without love. Mending all those broken hearts. And tending to those crying faces. There must be more to life than this. There must be more than meets the eye. Why should it be just a case of black or white. There must be more to life than this. Why is this world so full of hate. People dying everywhere. And we destroy what we create. People fighting for their human rights. But we just go on saying c'est la vie. So this is life. There must be more to life than killing. A better way for us to survive. I live in hope for a world filled with love. Then we can all just live in peace. There must be more to life than this. There must be more to life than this. I live in hope for a world filled with love.

too much love will kill you,"Words and music by Brian May, Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers. I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be. Too many bitter tears are raining down on me. I'm far away from home. And I've been facing this alone. For much too long. I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me. About growing up and what a struggle it would be. In me tangled state of mind. I've been looking back to find. Where I went wrong. Too much love will kill you. If you can't make up your mind. Torn between the lover. And the love you leave behind. You're headed for disaster. 'cos you never read the signs. Too much love will kill you. Every time. I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be. And it seems like there's no way out of this for me. I used to bring you sunshine. Now all I ever do is bring you down. How would it be if you were standing in my shoes. Can't you see that it's impossible to choose. No there's no making sense of it. Every way I go I'm bound to lose. Too much love will kill you. Just as sure as none at all. It'll drain the power that's in you. Make you plead and scream and crawl. And the pain will make you crazy. You're the victim of your crime. Too much love will kill you. Every time. Too much love will kill you. It'll make your life a lie. Yes, too much love will kill you. And you won't understand why. You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul. But here it comes again. Too much love will kill you. In the end.... In the end.."

Here come the war,. war, warboys. Warboys,. children and their toys. Warboys,. make a lot of noise. Warboys,. when the lightning explodes. I pray for your soul. Well they look so fierce. gonna tear out your heart. When they get near. gonna see what they got. Hold on to your soul,. friend of mine. I'll see you in hell,. some other time. Here come. the warboys, warboys. Mmm. Warboys, warboys"
was it all worth it,Words and music by Queen. What is there left for me to do in this life. Did I achieve what I had set in my sights. Am I a happy man or is this sinking sand. Was it all worth it was it all worth it. Yeah now hear my story let me tell you about it. We bought a drum kit blew my own trumpet. Played the circuit thought we were perfect. Was it all worth it. Giving all my heart and soul and staying up all night. Was it all worth it. Living breathing rock'n'roll a godforsaken life. Was it all worth it was it all worth it all these years. Put down our money without counting the cost. It didn't matter if we won if we lost. Yes we were vicious yes we could kill. Yes we were hungry yes we were brill. We served a purpose like a bloody circus. We were so dandy we love you madly. Was it all worth it. Living breathing rock'n'roll this godforsaken life. Was it all worth it was it all worth it. When the hurly burly's done. We went to Bali saw God and Dali. So mystic surrealistic. Was it all worth it yeah yeah. Giving all my heart and soul staying up all night. Was it all worth it. Living breathing rock'n'roll this never ending fight. Was it all worth it was it all worth it. Yes it was a worthwhile experience.
we are the champions,"I've paid my dues. Time after time. I've done my sentence. But committed no crime. And bad mistakes. I've made a few. I've had my share of sand. Kicked in my face. But I've come through. We are the champions, my friends. And we'll keep on fighting. 'Til the end. We are the champions. We are the champions. No time for losers. Cause we are the champions of the world. I've taken my bows. And my curtain calls. You brought me fame and fortune. And everything that goes with it. I thank you all. But it's been no bed of roses. No pleasure cruise. I consider it a challenge before. The whole human race. And I ain't gonna lose. We are the champions, my friends. And we'll keep on fighting. 'Til the end. We are the champions. We are the champions. No time for losers. Cause we are the champions of the world. We are the champions, my friends. And we'll keep on fighting. 'Til the end. We are the champions. We are the champions. No time for losers. Cause we are the champions"
we believe,I believe. there's no evil out there. we didn't have a hand in. You believe it's a time. for peace and a time. for understanding. Some of us believe. that we are chosen. And if God is on our side. we'll win the game. And some of us believe. that there's a heaven. When the trumpets sound. and the judges call your name. But let's get it straight. I believe there's just once chance. in this world to hear our brothers. You believe there's a better way. to listen to each other. We don't get what the other guy is saying. We hear the words but we don't understand. So around the world the same old anger raging. And we all cry for shame. and the same old tragedy goes down. We believe there's a better way to fight. There's a way to make our children safe at night. We believe there's a war we could be winning. But the only way to win. is to give what we need to receive. I believe we need a hero to step. boldly from the shadows. You believe there must be someone. on the scene that fits the bill. A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry. With courage in his heart to match his creed. A leader who can build a brand new morning. And match the tide of changes. Match the intent with the deed. We believe there's a deed of obligation. To bring reconciliation. To make peace with every nation - in our time. We believe there's not a minute we should be wasting. When the darkness falls it's too late to fix the crime. It's peace that we need. Every father every mother knows the meaning. Human treasure that our leaders do forget. And the bullets fly in the face of common reason. And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get. We believe there's a song that's worth the singing. It's a song of truth we're bringing. There's a way to share the Earth with everyone. We believe every creature has a being. Has a right to respect and feeling. To live and breathe and flourish in the sun. That's what we believe

white man,Words and music by Brian May. I'm a simple man with a simple name. From this soil my people came. In this soil remain oh yeah oh yeah. And we made us our shoes. And we trod soft on the land. But the immigrant built roads. On our blood and sand oh yeah. White man White man. Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies. White man White man. You took away the sight to blind my simple eyes. White man White man. Where you gonna hide from the hell you've made. Oh the red man knows wars. With his hands and his knives. On the Bible you swore. Fought your battle with lies oh yeah. Leave my body in shame. Leave my soul in disgrace. But by ev'ry god's name. Say a prayer for your race oh yeah. White man White man. Our country was green and all our rivers wide. White man White man. You came with a gun and soon our children died. White man White man. Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed?. White man White man. White man. White man White man. Fought you battled with lies. White man White man. Still lies. White man White man. Say you look around every skin and bone again. What is left of your dream?. Just the words on your stone. A man who learned how to teach. Then forgot how to learn. Oh yeah
white queen (as it began),So sad her eyes smiling dark eyes. So sad her eyes as it began. On such a breathless night as this. Upon my brow the lightest kiss. I walked alone. And all around the air did sway. My lady soon will stir this way. In sorrow known. The white queen walks. And the night grows pale. Stars of lovingness in her hair. Heeding unheard pleading one word. So sad my eyes she cannot see. How did thee fare what have thee seen. The mother of the willow green. I call her name. And 'neath her window have I stayed. I loved the footsteps that she made. And when she came. White queen how my heart did ache. And dry my lips no word would make. So still I wait. My goddess hear my darkest fear. I speak too late. It's for evermore that I wait. Dear friend goodbye. No tears in my eyes. So sad it ends. As it began
who needs you,I make it half past six you come at seven. Always try to keep me hanging round. You little spoilt thing girl you kept me waiting. Never contemplating my point of view. This comes as no surprise. I'm a fool for I believed your lies. But now I've seen through your disguise. Who needs well I don't need who needs you?. Oh I believed you. Went on my knees to you. How I trusted you. But you turned me down. But it's dog eat dog in this rat race. And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face. Reaching out reaching out for a helping hand. Where is that helping hand?. I like it I like it. Well I don't need you. How I was pushed around. Don't let it get you down. You walked all over me. But don't you ever give in. Taking one step forward slipping two steps back. There's an empty feeling that you can't forget. Reaching out for a helping hand. When I met you you were always charming. Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine. You were oh so so sophisticated. Never interested in what I'd say. I had to swallow my pride. So naive you took me for a ride. But now I'm the one to decide
who wants to live forever,There's no time for us. There's no place for us. What is this thing that builds our dreams. And slips away from us?. Who wants to live forever?. Who wants to live forever?. There's no chance for us. It's all decided for us. This world has only one sweet moment. Set aside for us. Who wants to live forever?. Who wants to live forever?. Who dares to love forever?. When love must die?. Oh! Touch my tears with your lips. Touch my world with your fingertips. And we can have forever. And we can love forever. Forever is our today. Who wants to live forever?. Who wants to live forever?. Forever is our today. Who waits forever anyway?
you and i,Words and music by John Deacon. Music is playing in the darkness. And a lantern goes swinging by. Shadows flickering my heart's jittering. Just you and I. Not tonight come tomorrow. When ev'rything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright). No no no come tomorrow 'cause then. We'll be waiting in the moonlight. We'll go walking in the moonlight. Walking in the moonlight. Laughter ringing in the darkness. People drinking for days gone by. Time don't mean a thing. When you're by my side. Please stay awhile. You know I never could forsee the future years. You know I never could see. Where life was leading me. But will we be together forever?. What will be my love?. Can't you see that I just don't know. No not tonight not tomorrow. Ev'rything's gonna be alright (sunny and bright). Wait and see if tomorrow we'll be. As happy as we're feeling tonight. We'll go walking in the moonlight (we'll be happy). Walking in the moonlight. I can hear the music in the darkness. Floating softly to where we lie. No more questions now. Let's enjoy tonight. (Just you and I) just you and I. Just you and I. Can't you see that we've gotta be together. Be together just you and I just you and I. No more questions just you and I.

you take my breath away,Oooh oooh take it take it all away. Oooh ooh take my breath away. Oooh ooh yoooo take my breath away. Look into my eyes and you'll see I'm the only one. You've captured my love stolen my heart. Changed my life. Every time you make a move you destroy my mind. And the way you touch. I lose control and shiver deep inside. You take my breath away. You can reduce me to tears with a single sigh. (Please don't cry anymore). Every breath that you take. Any sound that you make is a whisper in my ear. I could give up all my life for just one kiss. I would surely die if you dismiss me from your love. You take my breath away. So please don't go. Don't leave me here all by myself. I get ever so lonely from time to time. I will find you anywhere you go. I'll be right behind you. Right until the ends of the earth. I'll get no sleep until I find you. To tell you that you just take my breath away. I will find you anywhere you go. Right until the ends of the earth. I'll get no sleep until I find you. To tell you when I've found you. I love you. Take my breath take my breath... away
