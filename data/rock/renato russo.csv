Clothes of sand have covered your face. Given you meaning, taken my place. So make your way on, down to the sea. Something has taken you, so far from me.. Does it now seem worth all the colour of skies?. To see the earth, through painted eyes?. To look through panes of shaded glass?. See the stains of winter's grass.. Can you now return to from where you came?. Try to burn, your changing name?. Or with silver spoons and coloured light. Will you worship moons, in winter's night.. Clothes of sand have covered your face. Given you meaning taken my place. So make your way on, down to the sea. Something has taken you, so far from me."

and so it goes,"In every heart there is a room. A sanctuary safe and strong. To heal the wounds from lovers past. Until a new one comes along. I spoke to you in cautious tones. You answered me with no pretense. And still I feel I said too much. My silence is my self defense. And every time I've held a rose. It seems I only felt the thorns. And so it goes, and so it goes. And so will you soon I suppose. But if my silence made you leave. Then that would be my worst mistake. So I will share this room with you. And you can have this heart to break. And this is why my eyes are closed. It's just as well for all I've seen. And so it goes, and so it goes. And you're the only one who knows. So I would choose to be with you. That's if the choice were mine to make. But you can make decisions too. And you can have this heart to break. And so it goes, and so it goes. And you're the only one who know"

Close the door lightly when you go. Close the door lightly when you go"

"hey, that's no way to say goodbye",I loved you in the morning. Our kisses deep and warm. Your head upon the pillow. Like a sleepy golden storm.. Yes many loved before us. I know that we are not new. In cities and in forests. They smile like me and you.. But now it's come to distances. And both of us must cry. Your eyes are soft with sorrow. Hey that's no way to say goodbye.. I'm not looking for another as I. Wander in my time. Walk me to the corner. Our steps will always ride.. You know my love goes with you. And your love stays with me. It's just the way it changes.

i get along without you very well,"I get along without you very well. Of course I do. Except when soft rains fall. And drip from leaves then I recall. The thrill of being sheltered in your arms. Of course I do. But I get along without you very well. I've forgotten you just like I should. Of course I have. Except to hear your name. Or someone's laugh that is the same. But I've forgotten you like I should. What a guy, what a fool am I. To think my breaking heart could kid the moon. What's in store, should I phone once more. No it's best that I stick to my tune. I get along without you very well. Of course I do. Except perhaps in spring. But I should never think of spring. For that would surely break my heart in two"

if tomorrow never comes,Sometimes late at night. I lie awake and watch him sleeping. He's lost in peaceful dreams. So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark. And the thought crosses my mind. If I never wake up in the morning. Would he ever doubt the way I feel. About him in my heart. If tomorrow never comes. Will he know how much I loved him. Did I try in every way to show him every day. That he's my only one. And if my time on earth were through. And he must face the world without me. Is the love I gave him in the past. Gonna be enough to last. If tomorrow never comes. 'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life. Who never knew how much I loved them. Now I live with the regret. That my true feelings for them. never were revealed. So I made a promise to myself. To say each day how much he means to me. And avoid the circumstance. Where there's no second chance to tell him. how I feel. So tell that someone that you love. Just what you're thinking of

And though our separation,. It pierced me to the heart. He still live inside of me, we've never been apart.. If you get close to him, kiss him once for me. I always have respected him. For doing what he did and gettin' free. Oh, whatever makes him happy,. I won't stand in the way. Though the bitter taste still lingers on. From the night I tried to make him stay.. I see a lot of peoples as I make the rounds. And I hear his name here and there. As I go from town to town. And I've never gotten used to it,. I've just learned to turn it off. Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm fettin' soft.. Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past. I know every scene by heart,. They all went by so fast. If he's comin' back this way,. I'm not that hard to find. Tell him he can look me up if he's got the time.. By GaGa [LP]"

And we sit in a bar and talk till two. 'Bout life and love as old friends do. And tell each other what we've been through. How love is rare, life is strange. Nothing lasts, people change. And I ask him if his life is ever lonely. And if he ever feels despair. And he says he's learned to love it. 'Cause that's really a part of it. And it helps him feel the good times when they're there. And we wonder if I'll live with any lover. Or spend my life alone. And the bartender is dozing. And it's getting time for closing.

Knowing neon nights missing all the stars. All the sad young men drifting through the town. Drinking up the night trying not to drown. All the sad young men singing in the cold.

Sad young men are growing old. And that's the cruelest part. All the sad young men seek a certain smile. Someone they can hold for a little while. Tired little girl does the best she can. Trying to be gay for her sad young man. While the grimy moon watches from above. All the sad young men play of making love. Misbegotten moon shine for sad young men. let your gentle light guide them home tonight. All the sad young men"

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away. They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of. burned-out Chevrolets. They scream your name at night in the streets. Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet. And in the lonely cool before dawn. You hear their engines roarin' on. But when you get to the front porch, they're gone. On the wind. So Mary climb in. It's a town full of losers. And I'm pullin' outta here to win"
when you wish upon a star,When you wish upon a star. Makes no difference who you are. Anything your heart desires. Will come to you. If your hearts is in your dream. No request is too extreme. When you wish upon a star. Like dreamers do. Fate is kind. She brings to those who love. The sweet fulfillment of. Their secret longing. Like a bolt out of the blue. Fate steps in and pulls you through. When you wish upon a star. Your dream comes true.
