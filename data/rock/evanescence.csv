my immortal,"I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave. 'Cause your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. You used to captivate me by your resonating light. Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me. I've been alone all along. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me"

my heart is broken,"I will wander till the end of time. Torn away from you. I pulled away to face the pain. I close my eyes and drift away. Over the fear. That I will never find a way. To heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Torn away from you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us from sorrow's hold. Over my heart, heart. I can't go on living this way. But I can't go back the way I came. Chained of this fear. That I will never find the way. To heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Half alive without you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. Change. Open your eyes to the light. I denied it all so long, oh so long. Say goodbye. Goodbye. My heart is broken. Release me, I can't hold on. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us from sorrow's hold."
imaginary,I linger in the doorway. Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name. Let me stay. Where the wind will whisper to me. Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Don't say I'm out of touch. With this rampant chaos - your reality. I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge. The nightmare I built my own world to escape. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming. Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights. Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming. The goddess of imaginary light. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me
good enough,"Under your spell again. I can't say no to you. Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand. I can't say no to you. Shouldn't have let you torture me so sweetly. Now I can't let go of this dream. I can't breathe but I feel. Good enough. I feel good enough for you. Drink up sweet decadence. I can't say no to you. And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind. I can't say no to you. Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely. Now I can't let go of this dream. Can't believe that I feel. Good enough. I feel good enough. It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good. And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall. Pour real life down on me. Cause I can't hold on to anything this. Good enough. Am I good enough. For you to love me too?. So take care what you ask of me. Cause I can't say no"
tourniquet,I tried to kill the pain. But only brought more (so much more). I lay dying. And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal. I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming. Am I too lost to be saved?. Am I too lost?. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. Do you remember me. Lost for so long. Will you be on the other side. Or will you forget me. I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming. Am I too lost to be saved. Am I too lost?. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. I want to die. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My god my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My wounds cry for the grave.

hi-lo (feat. lindsey stirling),"I don't know your heart. I don't know where to begin. But I could feel you erasing. The rivers I'd drawn in. The more I stood still. The faster you were running.

4th of july,Shower in the dark day. Clean sparks driving down. Cool in the waterway. Where the baptized drown. Naked in the cold sun. Breathing life like fire. Thought I was the only one. But that was just a lie. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Pale in the flare light. The scared light cracks & disappears. And leads the scorched ones here. And everywhere no one cares. The fire is spreading. And no one wants to speak about it. Down in the hole. Jesus tries to crack a smile. Beneath another shovel load. And I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Now I'm in control. Now I'm in the fall out. Once asleep but now I stand. And I still remember. Your sweet everything. Light a Roman candle. And hold it in your hand. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July

All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. I believe that dreams are sacred. Take my darkest fears and play them. Like a lullaby. Like a reason why. Like a play of my obsessions. Make me understand the lesson. So I'll find myself. So I wont be lost again. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. Guess I thought I'd have to change the world. To make you see me. To be the one. I could have run forever. But how far would I have come. Without mourning your love?. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door. My ghosts are gaining on me. Should it hurt to love you?. Should I feel like I do?. Should I lock the last open door?. My ghosts are gaining on me

away from me,"I hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll. I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds. But oh, God, I feel I've been lied to. Lost all faith in the things I have achieved. And I. [CHORUS:]. I've woken now to find myself. In the shadows of all I have created. I'm longing to be lost in you. (away from this place I have made). Won't you take me away from me. Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins. I look into myself, but my own heart has been changed. I can't go on like this. I loathe all I've become. [Chorus]. Lost in a dying world I reach for something more. I have grown so weary of this lie I live. [Chorus]. I've woken now to find myself. I'm lost in the shadows on my own. I'm longing to be lost in you. Away from me"

bleed (i must be dreaming),How can I pretend that I don't see. What you hide so carelessly?. I saw her bleed. You heard me breathe. And I froze inside myself. And turned away. I must be dreaming. We all live. We all die. That does not begin to justify you. It's not what it seems. Not what you think. No I must be dreaming. It's only in my mind. Not in real life. No I must be dreaming. Help you know I've got to tell someone. Tell them what I know you've done. I fear you but spoken fears can come true. We all live. We all die. That does not begin to justify you.

breathe no more,"I've been looking in a mirror for so long. That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side. All the little pieces falling, shattered. Shards of me too sharp to put back together. Too small to matter. But big enough to cut me into so many. Little pieces if I try to touch her. And I bleed. I bleed. And I breathe. I breathe, no more. I take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well. Yet again you refuse to drink. Like a stubborn child. Lie to me convince me that I've been sick forever. And all of this will make sense when I get better. But I know the difference between myself and my reflection. I just can't help but to wonder which of us do you love. So I bleed. I bleed. And I breathe. I breathe no. Bleed. I bleed. And I breathe. I breathe. I breathe. I breathe, no more"

In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby (paper flowers). I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me (paper flowers). . . [by:Gothika And Léo]"
imperfection,"The more you try to fight it. The more you try to hide it. The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it. You know you can't deny it. The world's a little more fucked up everyday. I'm gonna save you from it. Together we'll outrun it. Just don't give into the fear. So many things I would've told you. If I knew that I was never gonna see you again. I wanna lift you up. Into the light. That you deserve. I wanna take your pain. Into myself. So you won't hurt. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. The way you look us over. Your counterfeit composure. Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower. The world is on our shoulders. Do you really know the weight of the words you say?. You want a little of it. You just can't let go of it. You've got an ego to feed. Too late to rise above it. Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade. I'm gonna lift you up. Into the light. That you deserve. I'm gonna take you down. To the real world. So you can watch it burn. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. We stand undefined. Can't be drawn with a straight line. This will not be our ending. We are alive, we are alive. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. 'Cause I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection. Don't you dare surrender. I'm still right beside you. And I could never. Replace your perfect imperfection"
lacrymosa,"Out on your own. Cold and alone again. Can this be what you really wanted, baby?. Blame it on me. Set your guilt free. Nothing can hold you back now. Now that you're gone. I feel like myself again. Grieving the things I can't repair and willing.... To let you blame it on me. And set your guilt free. I don't want to hold you back now love. I can't change who I am. Not this time, I won't lie to keep you near me. And in this short life. There's no time to waste on giving up. My love wasn't enough. And you can blame it on me. Just set your guilt free, honey. I don't want to hold you back now love. (Lacrimosa dies illa,. Qua resurget ex favilla judicandus homo reus.. Huic ergo parce, Deus.. Pie Jesu, domine dona eis requiem. Amén)"

lies,"Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear. Sealed with lies through so many tears. Lost from within, pursuing the end. I fight for the chance to be lied to again. You will never be strong enough. You will never be good enough. You were never conceived in love. You will not rise above. [CHORUS:]. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me. But through my tears breaks a blinding light. Birthing a dawn to this endless night. Arms outstretched, awaiting me. An open embrace upon a bleeding tree. Rest in me and I'll comfort you. I have lived and I died for you. Abide in me and I vow to you. I will never forsake you. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me"

like you,"Stay low. Soft, dark, and dreamless. Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness. I hate me. For breathing without you. I don't want to feel anymore for you. Grieving for you. I'm not grieving for you. Nothing real love can't undo. And though I may have lost my way. All paths lead straight to you. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. Halo. Blinding wall between us. Melt away and leave us alone again. Humming, haunted somewhere out there. I believe our love can see us through in death. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. I'm coming for you. You're not alone. No matter what they told you you're not alone. I'll be right beside you forevermore. I long to be like you, sis. Lie cold in the ground like you dear. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. And as we lay in silent bliss. I know you remember me. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. I'm coming for you"

With all the pretty flowers in the dust. Mary had a lamb. His eyes black as coals. If we play very quiet, my lamb. Mary never has to know. Just once in my life. I think it'd be nice. Just to lose control, just once. If I cut you down to a thing I can use. I fear there will be nothing good left of you"
lost in paradise,"I've been believing. In something so distant. As if I was human. And I've been denying. This feeling of hopelessness. In me, in me. All the promises I made. Just to let you down. You believed in me, but I'm broken. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. As much as I'd like. The past not to exist. It still does. As much as I'd like. To feel like I belong here. I'm just as scared as you. I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Run away, run away. One day we won't feel this pain anymore. Take it all away. Shadows of you. 'Cause they won't let me go. Till I have nothing left. And all I feel is this cruel wanting. We've been falling for all this time. And now I'm lost in paradise. Alone and lost in paradise"

my heart is broken,"I will wander till the end of time. Torn away from you. I pulled away to face the pain. I close my eyes and drift away. Over the fear. That I will never find a way. To heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Torn away from you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us from sorrow's hold. Over my heart, heart. I can't go on living this way. But I can't go back the way I came. Chained of this fear. That I will never find the way. To heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Half alive without you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. Change. Open your eyes to the light. I denied it all so long, oh so long. Say goodbye. Goodbye. My heart is broken. Release me, I can't hold on. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us from sorrow's hold."
my immortal,"I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave. 'Cause your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. You used to captivate me by your resonating light. Now I'm bound by the life you've left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real.

my immortal original version 1997,I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. I would give the very breath from my chest. To give you all the things that my mind couldn't bear. And if you have to leave. I wish that you would just leave. 'Cause your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. You used to captivate me. By your resonating light. Now I'm bound by the life you left behind. Your face it haunts. My once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away. All the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. I'd love to walk away and pull myself out of the rain. But I can't leave without you. I'd love to live without the constant fear and endless doubt. But I can't live without you. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me
my last breath,Hold on to me love. You know I can't stay long. All I wanted to say was I love you. And I'm not afraid. Can you hear me?. Can you feel me in your arms?. Chorus:. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight. I'll miss the winter. A world of fragile things. Look for me in the white forest. Hiding in a hollow tree. (Come find me). I know you hear me. I can taste it in your tears. Chorus:. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight. Closing your eyes to disappear. You pray your dreams. Will leave you here. But still you wake and know the truth. No one's there. Say goodnight. Don't be afraid. Calling me calling me. As you fade to black. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light. It ends here tonight
never go back,"Everything is so dark. And I know there's something wrong but I can't turn the light on. In that split second change. When you knew we couldn't hold on. I realized I live to love you. Save yourself!. Don't look back!. Tearing us apart until it's all gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I remember. I won't give up on you. I can feel you in my heart just show me the way. I don't belong here. Alone. I can still see your face. Where it's burned into my mind. I die every time. I close my eyes, you're always there. Save yourself!. Don't look back!. Tearing us apart until it's all gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I'm the one who's drowning. Without your love. I am lost and I can never go back home. All across the ocean. We are calling. Calling.... Ah. Ah, are you there?. Nothing left for me 'till I find you because it's. All gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I'm the one who's drowning. Without your love. I am lost and I can never go back. I can never go back home"
new way to bleed,"Save your twisted enemy. So you might earn forgiveness. You know your whole world is waiting. So why can't you speak?. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?. So go and tell all your friends. That I'm a failure underneath. If it makes you feel like a bigger man. But it's my, my heart, my life that you're calling a lie. I've played this game before. And I can't take anymore. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?. By drifting far beyond the end. Freedom, freedom can't you feel the ground caving in?. Freedom, give us a reason to believe again. I feel it coming over me. I'm still a slave to these dreams. Is this the end of everything?. Or just a new way to bleed?"

oceans,Don't want to be the one to walk away. But I can't bear the thought of one more day. I think I finally understand what it means to be lost. Can't find the road to lead us out of this. A million miles from where we burned the bridge. Can't keep pretending everything's gonna be alright. With the whole world. Falling around me. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands. Fallen so far from where we were before. You'll never find what you've been searching for. Something to fill the void and make up for all of those missing pieces of you. Like I could only dream to do. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. Everything that we believed in was a lie. Cross the oceans in your mind. Find a way to blur the line. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands. And we never learn. So we fall down again. Heaven help me find a way to dream. Within this nightmare. Cross the oceans in my mind. Find the strength to say goodbye. Everything that we believed in was a lie. Cross the oceans in your mind. Find a way to blur the line. In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands

sally's song,"I sense there's something in the wind. That feels like tragedy's at hand. And though I'd like to stand by him. Can't shake this feeling that I have. The worst is just around the bend. And does he notice my feelings for him?. And will he see how much he means to me?. I think it's not to be. What will become of my dear friend?. Where will his actions lead us then?.

[Never sleep never die]"
whisper (ep version),"Catch me as I fall. Say you're here and it's all over now. Speaking to the atmosphere. No one's here and I fall into myself. This truth drives me into madness. I know I can stop the pain. If I will it all away. If I will it all away. Don't turn away. (Don't give in to the pain). Don't try to hide. (Though they're screaming your name). Don't close your eyes. (God knows what lies behind them). Don't turn out the light. (Never sleep, never die). I'm frightened by what I see. But somehow I know that there's much more to come. Immobilized by my fear. And soon to be blinded by tears. I can stop the pain. If I will it all away. If I will it all away. Don't turn away. (Don't give in to the pain). Don't try to hide. (Though they're screaming your name). Don't close your eyes. (God knows what lies behind them). Don't turn out the light. (Never sleep, never die). Fallen angels at my feet. Whispered voices at my ear. Death before my eyes. Lying next to me, I fear. She beckons me, shall I give in?. Upon my end, shall I begin?. Forsaking all I've fallen. For I rise to meet the end. . Don't turn away. (Don't give in to the pain). Don't try to hide. (Though they're screaming your name). Don't close your eyes. (God knows what lies behind them). Don't turn out the light. (Never sleep, never die)"
you,"The words have been drained from this pencil. Sweet words that I want to give you. And I can't sleep, I need to tell you... goodnight. When we're together I feel perfect. When I'm pulled away from you I fall apart. All that you say is sacred to me. Your eyes are so blue, I can't look away as we lay in the stillness. You whisper to me:. -Amy, marry me, promise you'll stay with me. Oh you don't have to ask me, you know you're all that I live for. You know I'd die just to hold you, stay with you. Somehow I'll show you that you are my night sky. I've always been right behind you. Now I'll always be right beside you. So many nights I've cried myself to sleep. Now that you love me I love myself. I never thought I would say that. I never thought there'd be you"
your love (teaser),Wait forever for your love. Make believe that we're the only ones. Holding on to whispers of your love. All we are is a dream beyond the dawn
your star,"I can't see your star. I can't see your star. Though I patiently waited, bedside. for the death of today. I can't see your star. The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away. And I'm alone now. Me and all I stood for. We're wandering now. All in parts in pieces, swim lonely. Find your own way out. I can't see your star. I can't see your star. How can the darkness feel so wrong?. And I'm alone now. Me and all I stood for. We're wandering now. All in parts in pieces, swim lonely. Find your own way out. So far away. Its growing colder without your love. Why can't you feel me calling your name?. Can't break the silence. Its breaking me. All my fears turn to rage. And I'm alone now me. And all I stood for. We're wandering now. All in parts and pieces, swim lonely. Find your own way out. Now, Nothing worth fighting for. We're wandering now. All in parts and pieces, swim lonely. Find your own way out"
zero,"My reflection, dirty mirror. There's no connection to myself. I'm your lover, I'm your zero. I'm the face in your dreams of glass. So save your prayers. For when you're really gonna need 'em. Throw out your cares and fly. Wanna go for a ride?. She's the one for me. She's all I really need. 'Cause she's the one for me. Emptiness is loneliness and loneliness is cleanliness. And cleanliness is godliness, and God is empty just like me. Intoxicated with the madness. I'm in love with my sadness. Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms. The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth. I never let on that I was on a sinking ship. I never let on that I was down. You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore. You blame yourself for wanting more. She's the one for me. She's all I really need. She's the one for me. She's my one and only"
