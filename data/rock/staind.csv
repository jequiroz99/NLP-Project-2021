something to remind you,So this is it I say goodbye. To this chapter of my every changing life. And there's mistakes and the path is long. And I'm sure I'll answer for them when I'm gone. So when the day comes in the sun won't touch my face. Tell the ones who cared enough that I finally left this place. That's been so cold look at my face. All the stories it will tell I can't erase. The road is long. Just one more song. A little something to remind you when I'm gone. When I'm gone. The road to hell along the way. Is paved with good intentions so they say. And some believe that no good deed. Goes unpunished in the end or so it seems. So when the day comes in the sun won't touch my face. Tell the ones who cared enough that I finally left this place. That's been so cold look at my face. All the stories it will tell I can't erase. The road is long. Just one more song. A little something to remind you when I'm gone. When I'm gone. So this is it I say goodbye. To this chapter of my every changing life. And there's mistakes and the path is long. And I'm sure I'll answer for them when I'm gone
so far away,This is my life. It's not what it was before. All these feelings I've shared. These are my dreams. That I'd never lived before. Somebody shake me ‘cause I. I must be sleeping. CHORUS. Now that we're here. It's so far away. All the struggle we thought was in vain. All the mistakes. One life contained. They all finally start to go away. Now That we're here. It's so far away. And I feel like I can face the day. I can forgive. But I'm not ashamed. To be the person that I am today. These are my words. That I've never said before. I think I'm doing okay. And this is my smile. That I've never shown before. Somebody shake me ‘cause I. I must be sleeping. CHORUS. I am so afraid of waking. Please don't shake me. Afraid of waking. Please don't shake me. CHORUS
outside,"And you can bring me to my knees...Again. All the times when I could beg you please....In vain. All the times when I felt insecure....For you. And I leave my burdens at the door. But I'm on the outside. I'm looking in. I can see through you. See your true colors. Inside you're ugly. You're ugly like me. I can see through you. See to the real you. All the times that I felt like this won't end. It`s for you. And I taste what I could never have. It was from you. All the times that I've cried. My intentions, full of pride. But I waste more time than anyone. But I'm on the outside. I'm looking in. I can see through you. See your true colors. Inside you're ugly. You're ugly like me. I can see through you. See to the real you. All the times that I've cried. All this wasted, it's all inside. And I feel, all this pain. Stuffed it down, it's back again. And I lie, here in bed. All alone, I can't mend. But I feel, tomorrow will be okay. But I'm on the outside. And I'm looking in. I can see through you. See your true colors. Inside you're ugly. You're ugly like me. I can see through you. See to the real you"
it's been awhile,"It's been a while. Since I could.... Hold my head up high. It's been a while. Since I first saw you. It's been a while. Since I could stand. on my own two feet again. And it's been a while. Since I could call you. But everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem. The consequences that I've rendered. Have stretched myself beyond my means. It's been a while. Since I could say. that I wasn't addicted. It's been a while. Since I could say. I loved myself as well and.... It's been a while. Since I've gone and fucked things up. Just like I always do. It's been a while. But all that shit seems to disappear. When I'm with you. And everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem. Consequences that I've rendered. Gone and fucked things up again... again. Why must I feel this way?. Just make this go away. Just one more peaceful day. It's been a while. Since I could.... Look at myself straight. It's been a while. Since I said I'm sorry. It's been a while. Since I've seen the way. the candles light your face. It's been a while. But I can still. remember just the way you taste. Everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem to be,. I know it's me. I cannot blame this on my father. He did the best he could for me. It's been a while. Since I could.... Hold my head up high. It's been a while. Since I said I'm sorry"
right here,I know I've been mistaken. But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made. I've got some imperfections. But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face. But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting. You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting. And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting. Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting. I hope you're not intending. To be so condescending it's as much as I can take. and you're so independent. you just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break. But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting. You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting. And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting. Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting. I've made a commitment. I'm willing to bleed for you. I needed fulfillment. I found what I need in you. Why can't you just forgive me. I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made along the way. But I always find a way to keep you right here waiting. I always find the words to say to keep you right here waiting. But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting. You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting. And if I chose to walk away woul'd you be right here waiting. Searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting
everything changes,If you just walked away. What could I really say?. would it matter anyway?. would it change how you feel?. I am the mess you chose. the closet you can not close. The devil in you I suppose. 'cuz the wounds never heal. (Chorus). But everything changes. if I could turn back the years. If you could learn to forgive me. then I could learn to feel. Sometimes the things I say. In moments of disarray. Succumbing to the games we play. To make sure that it's real. (Chorus). When it's just me and you. Who knows what we could do. If we can just make it through. through this part of the day. (Chorus). Then we could. Stay here together. And we could. Conquer the world. If we could. Say that forever. It's more than just a word. If you just walked away. What could I really say?. It wouldn't matter anyway.. Would it changes how you feel?. by troubli
epiphany,"Your words to me just a whisper. Your face is so unclear. I try to pay attention. Your words just disappear.. Oh-ho. 'Cause it's always raining in my head. Forget all the things I should have said.. So I speak to you in riddles. 'Cause my words get in my way.. I smoke the whole thing to my head. And feel it wash away.. 'Cause I can't take anymore of this. I wanna come apart,. Or dig myself a little hole. Inside your precious heart.. Oh-ho. 'Cause it's always raining in my head. Forget all the things I should have said.. I am nothing more than. a little boy inside. That cries out for attention,. Yet I always try to hide.. 'Cause I talk to you like children,. Though I don't know how I feel. But I know I'll do the right thing. If the right thing is revealed.. 'Cause it's always raining in my head. Forget all the things I should have said.."
believe,"I sit alone and watch the clock,. Trying to collect my thoughts,. All I think about is you.. And so I cry myself to sleep,. And hope the devil I don't meet,. In the dreams that I live through.. Believe in me,. I know you've waited for so long.. Believe in me,. Sometimes a weak become the strong. Believe in me,. This life's not always what it seems.. Believe in me,. Cause I was made for chasing dreams. All the smiles you've had to fake,. All the shit you've had to take,. Just to lead us here again.. I never have the things to say,. To make it all just go away,. To make it all just disappear.. Believe in me,. I know you've waited for so long.. Believe in me,. Sometimes the weak become the strong.. Believe in me,. This life's not always what it seems.. Believe in me,. Cause I was made for chasing dreams.. It's my life,. It's my choice,. Feel my words,. Hear my voice,. And just believe.. I sit alone and watch the clock,. Trying to collect my thoughts,. And all I think about is you.. If you believe in me,. This life's not always what it seems.. Believe in me,. Cause I was made for chasing dreams. Believe in me,. I know you've waited for so long.. Believe in me,. Sometimes the weak become the strong. Believe in me,. This life's not always what it seems.. Believe in me,. Cause I was made for chasing dreams."

fade,I try to breathe. Memories overtaking me. I try to face them but. the thought is too. Much to concieve. I only know that I can change. Everything else just stays the same. So now I step out of the darkness. That my life became 'cause. I just needed someone to talk to. You were just too busy with yourself. You were never there for me to. Express how I felt. I just stuffed it down. Now I'm older and I feel like. I could let some of this anger fade. But it seems the surface. I am scratching. Is the bed that I have made. So where were you. When all this I was going through. You never took the time to ask me. Just what you could do. I only know that I can change. Everything else just stays the same. So now I step out of the darkness. That my life became 'cause. I just needed someone to talk to. You were just too busy with yourself. You were never there for me to. Express how I felt. I just stuffed it down. Now I'm older and I feel like. I could let some of this anger fade. But it seems the surface. I am scratching. Is the bed that I have made. I never meant to fade away (x2). I just needed someone to talk to. You were just too busy with yourself. You were never there for me to. Express how I felt. I just stuffed it down. Now I'm older and I feel like. I could let some of this anger fade. But it seems the surface. I am scratching. Is the bed that I have made
the way i am,I'm not very good at just paying attention. I'm not very good at remembering things that you say. I'm not very good at pursuing redemption. I'm not very good at consealing the hand that I play. It's the way I am. You'll never change. The way I am. I've rearranged. The way I am. Just let me be. The way I am. Is the way I am. I'm not really sure of the coming attractions. Not really sure of the illusions we read on the wall. I'm not really sure of the preaching we practice. I'm not really sure if we'll notice it before we fall. It's the way I'am. You'll never change. The way I'am. I've rearranged. The way I'am. Just let me be. The way I'am. Is the way I'am. Not very good at just paying attention. Not very good at just remembering things. I'm not very good at pursuing redemption. I'm not very good at consealing the hand that I play. When I'm trying so hard just to beat you. I'm not really good at controlling my fate. I'm not really good at consolling my anger. I'm not really good at subduing my hate. It's the way I am. You'll never change. The way I am. I've rearranged. The way I am. Just let me be. The way I am. Is the way I am
for you,[verse 1]. to my mother. to my father. it's your son or. it's your daughter. are my screams. loud enough for. you to hear me. should i turn this up for you?. [chorus]. i sit here locked inside my head. remembering everything you said. this silence gets us nowhere. gets us nowhere. way too fast. [verse 2]. the silence. is what kills me. i need someone. here to help me. but you don't know. how to listen. and let me make. my decisions. CHORUS. [verse 3 (bridge)]. all your insults. and your curses. make me feel like. i'm not a person. and i feel like. i am nothing. but you made me. so do something. cause i'm fucked up. because you are. need attention. attention you couldn't give. CHORUS (repeat).
pardon me,I'm one step from a breakdown. Two steps from being safe. Just try to see this through. I'm three steps from this nightmare. And four steps from the door. The rest is up to you. Pardon me while I just turn my back and walk away. Pardon me if I can't listen to the things you say. Pardon me if I can't fake it. While you still believe. Pardon me. I'm one step from forgiveness. And two steps from my grave. We're all just passing through. Three steps from redemption. Four from the devil's door. On a path that leads to you. Pardon me while I just turn my back and walk away. Pardon me if I can't listen to the things you say. Pardon me if I can't fake it. While you still believe. Pardon me. Pardon me while I just turn my back and walk away. Pardon me if I can't listen to the things you say. Pardon me if I can't fake it. While you still believe. Pardon me. I'm two steps from salvation. But I'm only taking one. Pardon me
how about you,If someone else showed you the way. Would you take the wheel and steer?. It hurts me that you´re not ashamed. Of what you're doing here. If they jumped off a bridge. Would you meet them on the ground?. Or would you try and claim. That it never made a sound?. Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. Ande learns to walk through life themselves. Not everything in life is handed on a plate. When people think your words are true. It doesn't matter what you do. I sold my soul to get here. How about you?. So you choose to force your hand. What a strange way to make friends. And you always change the rules. So the drama nerver ends. And you blindly go through life. Judging only by its worth. Just try not to forget. That the meek inherit earth. Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. Ande learns to walk through life themselves. Not everything in life is handed on a plate. When people think your words are true. It doesn't matter what you do. I sold my soul to get here. How about you?. So please don't take offense. This is just a point of view. 'Cause I'm the only one who. Will say these things to you. Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. Ande learns to walk through life themselves. Not everything in life is handed on a plate. When people think your words are true. It doesn't matter what you do. I sold my soul to get here. How about you?
throw it all away,It doesn't feel like this is over. It's never felt like it's begun. Always looking over my shoulder. Waiting for the end to come. And than you throw it all away. Throw it all away. Nothing I could say. Throw it all away. You feel like you're still here bleeding. You bleed until there's nothing left. It doesn't seem to ever be enough for me. It leaves me empty in the end. And than you throw it all away. Throw it all away. Nothing I could say. Throw it all away. It's never enough to breakdown inside. It's never enough to hold on to pride. It's never enough to give up your soul. It's never enough. It doesn't feel like this is over. And than you throw it all away. Throw it all away. Nothing I could say. Throw it all away
zoe jane,Well I want you to notice. To notice when I'm not around. And I know that your eyes see straight through me. And speak to me without a sound. I want to hold you. Protect you from all of the things I've already endured. And I want to show you. To show you all the things that this life has in store for you. I'll always love you. The way a father should love his daughter. When I walked out this morning. I cried as I walked to the door. I cried about how long I'd be away for. I cried about leaving you all alone. I want to hold you. Protect you from all of the things I've already endured. And I want to show you. To show you all the things that this life has in store for you. I'll always love you. The way a father should love his daughter. Sweet Zoe Jane. So I wanted to say this. 'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin. To explain to you what I have been through. To explain where your daddy has been. I want to hold you. Protect you from all of the things I've already endured. And I want to show you. To show you all the things that this life has in store for you. I'll always love you. The way a father should love his daughter. Sweet Zoe Jane
open your eyes,"As I walk along these streets. I see a man that walks alone. Distant echo of people's feet. He has no place to call his own. A shot rings out from a roof overhead. A crackhead asks for change nearby. An old man lies in an alleyway dead. A little girl lost just stands there and cries. What would you do, if it was you. Would you take everything. For granted like you do. A boy just 13 on the corner for sale. Swallows his pride for another hit. Overpopulation there's no room in jail. But most of you don't give a shit. That your daughters are porno stars. And your sons sell death to kids. You're so lost in your little worlds. Your little worlds you'll never fix. What would you do, if it was you. Would you take everything. For granted like you do. You turn away (x4). As I walk along the streets. Soaking up the acid rain. Underneath the taxi cabs. I hear the streets cry out in vain. What would you do, if it was you. Would you take everything. For granted like you do"
home,I force myself through another day. Can't explain the way today just fell apart like. everything. Right in my face. And I try to be the one. I can't accept this all because of you I've had to. walk away. From everything. and I'm afraid to be alone. Afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone. I'm afraid to come back home. Another sleepless night again. Hotel room's my only friend and friends like that just. don't add up. To anything. And I try so hard to be. Everything that I should never take away from you. again. I heard you say. and I'm afriad to be alone. afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone. and I'm afraid to come back home. I cannot forget. I live with regret. I cannot forget. I live with.... I live through this. I can't see through this. I can't do this anymore. Cause I'm afraid to be alone. afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone. and I'm afraid to come back home. afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone. I just wish I was back home. home.....
tangled up in you,"You're my world, the shelter from the rain. You're the pills that take away my pain. You're the light that helps me find my way. You're the words when I have nothing to say. And in this world where nothing else is true. Here I'm still tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you. Still tangled up in you. You're the fire that warms me when I'm cold. You're the hand I have to hold as I grow old. You're the shore when I'm lost at sea. You're the only thing that I like about me. And in this world where nothing else is true. Here I'm still tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you. How long has it been since this storyline began. And I hope it never ends and goes like this forever. In this world where nothing else is true. Here I'm still tangled up in you, tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you. Still tangled up in you"
safe place,"Another day inside my world. I'm married to you and this road. A road that never lets me sleep. And there's no way to escape. These demons I'm forced to keep. And then I find. You here. Through your eyes. Everything's clear. And I fall. Inside your arms. But I'm alone for now. I mean the best with what I say. It doesn't always sound that way. I never learned to work things out. Cause in my family all we ever seemed to do is shout. And then I find. You here. Through your eyes. Everything's clear. And I fall. Inside your Arms. But I'm alone for now. alone for now... And I try to sleep. The drugs I take are killing me. I think of you. To ease my pain. but you're so far... Now it's time to say goodbye... I Love You Baby, Please don't cry. And then i find. You here. Through your eyes. Everything's clear. And I fall. Inside your Arms. But I'm alone for now. Alone for now...."

falling down,what's happened to you?. it's obvious you've changed. something deep inside you is probably to blame. must be lonely up there with your head up in the clouds. even though you got there what does your conscience tell you now?. [chorus]. it's never the same on the way down. how does it feel when your feet finally hit the ground?. when all of your bridges aren't down. and the sandcastles you built are falling down. you had us all sitting right there in your hand. but you had to fall because that's how this life is. got your fingers burned by burning candles at both ends. now the table's turned and now your demons are you friends. [chorus]. [bridge]. so now i question what you're gonna do. now that everything's gone with you. you believe the shit you say is true. but everybody's on to you. life remembers everything you do. your karma has caught up with you.

4 walls,"The thoughts from my mind. Command my lips to say I hate you. The thoughts from my mind. Command my hands to cut your silken flesh. The thoughts from my mind.

Please take it all away. Same 4 walls. The thoughts from my mind. Feel the pain as rats claw at my flesh. The thoughts from my mind. Feel the joy as the needle hits my vein. The thoughts from my mind. Smell the stench as shit runs down my leg. The thoughts from my mind ask for sanity. Now for this I beg. Not much to this life I live. Same 4 walls. I have nothing left to give. Please take it all away. Same 4 walls. My mind is like today. Damp, dark, dreary. As the rain falls outside beating. The leaves hit the ground. I can feel it. Slipping away. Dying, without decay. Dying, like my soul. From the inside out. I can only pray. It won't be long. It won't be long now. It can't be long. It can't be long now. Help me (Where do I go from here?). The thoughts from my mind. Command my lips to say I hate you. The thoughts from my mind. Command my hands to cut your silken flesh. The thoughts from my mind. Command my feet to stomp your head. The thoughts from my mind have one question. When will I be dead?. This is the life I live. Same 4 walls. I have nothing left to give. Please take it all away. Same 4 walls. This is the life I live. Same 4 walls. I have nothing left to give. Please take it all away. Same 4 walls. Same 4 walls. Same 4 walls. Same 4 walls. There's nothing left for me...

a flat,"Trust in me can't trust. I know, I don't believe it. All my life so scarred. What for, you can't conceive it. Everything you fear. I'll be, you couldn't live it. I whisper in your ear. So loud, why can't you hear it. I'm OK. All my faith is gone. You think, I couldn't find it. Pieces falling down. Shattered, nothing behind it. In my mind alone. Lost here, I'm separated. Crawl deeper in my hole. Safe here, from what I've hated. All the demons in my head won't leave me. I know, I can hear them. All the sacrifices made for nothing. Don't show, can't believe in. Wanna show you that I'm good for something. I can't, you won't let me. All your artificial words won't heal me. Because you can't accept me. And I hate myself. And I hate my face. And I hate my world. And I hate my ways. I'm not OK. I'm OK."

Believe in me,. Cause I was made for chasing dreams."
black rain,"Well I know the words. But I can't really speak them... To you. And I hide all the pain. That I have gained with my wisdom.. From you. And I may analyze bout what I hold inside. All the things that I live with I can't easily hide. And I'm left here with nothing, nothing to live for... But you. Its not easy to hide all this damage inside. I'll carry it with me until I'm not alive. And you look at my face. Does it seem just as ugly.. To you. I can't seem to erase. All the scars I have lived with... From you. I am so sick of this place. And this taste in my mouth. Cause of you I can't figure what I'm all about. And I'm left here with nothing. Nothin to live for.... But you. It's not easy to hide all this damage inside. And I'll carry it with me until I'm not alive"
blow away,"Live in my head for just one day. I see myself and look away. The road is showing now on my face. Soon I'll disappear. Disappear without a fucking trace. [chorus]. Faces that I've seen turn old and grey. I've lost too many friends along the way. Memories I never thought would fade. They fade and blow away. I wish that I could disappear. Unzip my skin and leave it here. So I could be no one again. And never let nobody,. I'd let nobody. I'd never let nobody in. [chorus]. So now the walls are closing in. Because in life you sink or swim. Sometimes these shoes don't feel right in my head. Feel like a book that can't be read,. A book that can't be,. A book that can't be read. [chorus]"

change,If ever you had said to me before. That I would lead this life. That I am living now I guess it's all so strange. To feel the way I do inside and. Have so much that I could feel some. Pride for in my life so why is it that. I feel like this. (Chorus:). How do I feel? I've been here before. I've felt this. Retreat to a place a place within me I need this. Keep it all down bottled inside it breaks me. to torment again and. Torture me like it used to. I try and try to break away from all the hate. I'm feeling for everyone of you that's ever. Done me wrong I need to justify the reasons. For the way I'm living I guess I can't cause. I don't feel like I deserve it. (Chorus:). How do I feel? I've been here before. I've felt this. Retreat to a place a place within me I need this. Keep it all down bottled inside it breaks me. to torment again and. Torture me like it used to. So now the waves they have subsided. And my soul is bleeding. I can't take away all the shame I feel. Forgive me

could it be,well i don't know what to say. because there's truth to what you say. i know it kills you i'm this way. there's something different every day. [chorus]. could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside?. could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide?. could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree?. could it be that i'm only being me?. not easy living in my mind. a little peace is hard to find. my every thought is undermined. by all the history inside. [chorus]. [bridge]. i know i hear the words you said. over and over again. i just can't get them through my head. there's just too many voices. must be like living with the dead. waiting for me to begin. to do the things i have said. and for this i'm sorry. so there's some truth to what you say. [chorus].
crawl,I'm so lonely. You're so beautiful. Not the only. One that's pitiful. Stretched and torn I lay here in pieces. Craving all of your deadly vices. Like to think that I'm not addicted. But I guess I wear it well. And I crawl. While you spit. And I crawl through you. Here I am now. Not a lot has changed. Nothing better. Everything's the same. Late at night I can hear your voices. Talking shit about all my choices. You would think that you've known me forever. Just because you know my name. And I crawl while you spit. And I crawl through you. Everything falls apart. Everything. And I crawl while you spit. And I crawl through.
cross to bear,Staind - Cross to Bear. Twisting. Turning. Crashing. Burning. All this. Just to. Break me. Down. (chorus). You know me. You see me. You own me cuz I don't care. But I'm still here. Impatiently waiting for you to disappear. Is this my cross to bear. Faceless. Faking. Pushing. Taking. All this. Just to. Bring me. Down. (chorus). You know me. You own me cuz I'm aware. That I'm still here. Impatiently waiting for you to disappear. Is this my cross to bear. I'm still here. Reluctantly waiting for you to interfere. This is my cross to bear
devil,Staind - Devil. She sits alone again and tries her best not to pretend. that all she used to live for was the love that wasn't there. And every time she needs to do the things. that she believes will fill the void inside of her cuz he was never there. And she said. I swear I'm not the devil. who do you think I am. I swear I'm not the devil. And she said. I swear I'm not the devil. who do you think I am. I swear I'm not the devil. He tries to sleep again and wonders when the pain will end the cuts. they may run deeper than his cracking ever should. He looks with tired eyes at all the people hypnotized and wonders. what can save him from a self-created hell. And he said. I swear I'm not the devil. who do you think I am. I swear I'm not the devil. And He said. I swear I'm not the devil. who do you think I am. I swear I'm not the devil. I always fail to see the little things in front of me the things. that mean so much to you a way to let you know. That I appreciate the way you always tolerate but sometimes. when I medicate frustration in you shows me how you feel. But I swear I'm not the devil. who do you think I am. I swear I'm not the devil. and I scream. I swear I'm not the devil. who do you think I am. I swear I'm not the devil
epiphany,"Your words to me just a whisper. Your face is so unclear. I try to pay attention. Your words just disappear.. Oh-ho. 'Cause it's always raining in my head. Forget all the things I should have said.. So I speak to you in riddles. 'Cause my words get in my way.. I smoke the whole thing to my head. And feel it wash away.. 'Cause I can't take anymore of this. I wanna come apart,. Or dig myself a little hole. Inside your precious heart.. Oh-ho. 'Cause it's always raining in my head. Forget all the things I should have said.. I am nothing more than. a little boy inside. That cries out for attention,. Yet I always try to hide.. 'Cause I talk to you like children,. Though I don't know how I feel. But I know I'll do the right thing. If the right thing is revealed.. 'Cause it's always raining in my head. Forget all the things I should have said.."
everything changes,If you just walked away. What could I really say?. would it matter anyway?. would it change how you feel?. I am the mess you chose. the closet you can not close. The devil in you I suppose. 'cuz the wounds never heal. (Chorus). But everything changes. if I could turn back the years. If you could learn to forgive me. then I could learn to feel. Sometimes the things I say. In moments of disarray. Succumbing to the games we play. To make sure that it's real. (Chorus). When it's just me and you. Who knows what we could do. If we can just make it through. through this part of the day. (Chorus). Then we could. Stay here together. And we could. Conquer the world. If we could. Say that forever. It's more than just a word. If you just walked away. What could I really say?. It wouldn't matter anyway.. Would it changes how you feel?. by troubli
excess baggage,Well I know the words. But I can't really speak them. to you. And I hide all the pain. That I've gained with my wisdom. from you. And I'm Eaten Alive. By What I hold inside.

eyes wide open,"The hating and the waiting, hesitating. I just want to be done with you faking. For the taking but I’m wicked. Up to the fact that you’re lying, and denying. Justifying all the actions you take. It’s pathetic and poetic. It’s just sick!. It’s just sick!. Is compromise something you don’t understand?. You force your hand but my eyes are wide open.. Caught in the web of your self-serving plan.. Don’t force my hand when my eyes are wide open.. Seeing is believing, now I’m leaving. All the damage is done. And you’ve broken the notion of trust. Cause you’re lying and denying. Justifying all the actions you take. It’s pathetic and poetic. It’s just sick!. It’s just sick!. Is compromise something you don’t understand?. You force your hand but my eyes are wide open.. Caught in the web of your self-serving plan.. Don’t force my hand when my eyes are wide open.. Seeing is believing, now I’m leaving. All the damage is done. All the damage is done!. All the damage is done!. Is compromise something you don’t understand?. You force your hand but my eyes are wide open..

fade,I try to breathe. Memories overtaking me. I try to face them but. the thought is too. Much to concieve. I only know that I can change. Everything else just stays the same. So now I step out of the darkness. That my life became 'cause. I just needed someone to talk to. You were just too busy with yourself. You were never there for me to. Express how I felt. I just stuffed it down. Now I'm older and I feel like. I could let some of this anger fade. But it seems the surface. I am scratching. Is the bed that I have made. So where were you. When all this I was going through. You never took the time to ask me. Just what you could do. I only know that I can change. Everything else just stays the same. So now I step out of the darkness. That my life became 'cause. I just needed someone to talk to. You were just too busy with yourself. You were never there for me to. Express how I felt. I just stuffed it down. Now I'm older and I feel like. I could let some of this anger fade. But it seems the surface. I am scratching. Is the bed that I have made. I never meant to fade away (x2). I just needed someone to talk to. You were just too busy with yourself. You were never there for me to. Express how I felt. I just stuffed it down. Now I'm older and I feel like.

failing,Like the threat of the darkest clouds rolling in on a sunny day. Like a field that has no way. Like a dog that wanders aimless with no name. Like a cut without the pain. You got to feel this. You got to take the pain. You got to let go. And I'm just trying to get through to you. But I am failing. Lie like I'm not even here. My heart is breaking. Trying to see through your stare. It looks right through me. Smile and pretend I'm not there. To keep from going crazy. Like the day your guardian angel decided to fly away. Like a bruise that doesn't fade. Like a memory that tortures your soul until your dying day. Like a life you couldn't save. You got to feel this. You got to take the pain. You got to let go. And I'm just trying to get through to you. But I am failing. Lie like I'm not even here. My heart is breaking. Trying to see through your stare. It looks right through me. Smile and pretend I'm not there. To keep from going crazy. I tried to get through to you. I tried to. I tried to get through to you. I tried to. And I'm still just trying to get through to you.

falling down,what's happened to you?. it's obvious you've changed. something deep inside you is probably to blame. must be lonely up there with your head up in the clouds. even though you got there what does your conscience tell you now?. [chorus]. it's never the same on the way down. how does it feel when your feet finally hit the ground?. when all of your bridges aren't down. and the sandcastles you built are falling down. you had us all sitting right there in your hand. but you had to fall because that's how this life is. got your fingers burned by burning candles at both ends. now the table's turned and now your demons are you friends. [chorus]. [bridge]. so now i question what you're gonna do. now that everything's gone with you. you believe the shit you say is true. but everybody's on to you. life remembers everything you do. your karma has caught up with you. [chorus]
fill me up,"i just had to let you know. cuz i don't always let it show. you give me needed room to grow. and i just had to tell you so. [chorus]. you fill me up,. you're in my veins. a look could take my breath away. and all these things, you give away. sometimes i take for granted. it's just like poetry inside to hear you breathing by my side. like i'm in heaven and i've died. so glad you're with me for this ride. [chorus]. i see your face to start my day. makes all my bad dreams go away. and all the stupid games we play. wouldn't have it any other way. [chorus (x2)]"

[chorus]. i sit here locked inside my head. remembering everything you said. this silence gets us nowhere. gets us nowhere. way too fast. [verse 2]. the silence. is what kills me. i need someone. here to help me. but you don't know. how to listen. and let me make. my decisions. CHORUS. [verse 3 (bridge)]. all your insults. and your curses. make me feel like. i'm not a person. and i feel like. i am nothing. but you made me. so do something. cause i'm fucked up. because you are. need attention. attention you couldn't give.

fray,"I know that it never goes away. All I feel, everything I'm not today. So I try and I try to make everything right. I don't feel like I'm doing it, it affects me. [chorus]. You wouldn't listen even if I told you. Who the fuck am I to say?. You're too busy with the lies they sold you. Another cure to fix your day. Open wide for all the shit they feed you. While the TV defecates. And blindly walk wherever they will lead you. While the edges slowy fray. I know that everything can change. What I need is to open up again. So never again will I look back in vain. 'Cause today's not the past, I don't need to relive it. [chorus]. Are you satisfied?. I've given all I can. And are you pacified. Or do you want more from me?. [chorus]. I've learned that this life's not just a game. Just a line between the pleasures and the pain. [chorus]."
home,I force myself through another day. Can't explain the way today just fell apart like. everything. Right in my face. And I try to be the one. I can't accept this all because of you I've had to. walk away. From everything. and I'm afraid to be alone. Afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone. I'm afraid to come back home. Another sleepless night again. Hotel room's my only friend and friends like that just. don't add up. To anything. And I try so hard to be. Everything that I should never take away from you. again. I heard you say. and I'm afriad to be alone. afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone. and I'm afraid to come back home. I cannot forget. I live with regret. I cannot forget. I live with.... I live through this. I can't see through this. I can't do this anymore. Cause I'm afraid to be alone. afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone. and I'm afraid to come back home. afraid you'll leave me when I'm gone. I just wish I was back home. home.....
how about you,If someone else showed you the way. Would you take the wheel and steer?. It hurts me that you´re not ashamed. Of what you're doing here. If they jumped off a bridge. Would you meet them on the ground?. Or would you try and claim. That it never made a sound?. Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. Ande learns to walk through life themselves. Not everything in life is handed on a plate. When people think your words are true. It doesn't matter what you do. I sold my soul to get here. How about you?. So you choose to force your hand. What a strange way to make friends. And you always change the rules. So the drama nerver ends. And you blindly go through life. Judging only by its worth. Just try not to forget. That the meek inherit earth. Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. Ande learns to walk through life themselves. Not everything in life is handed on a plate. When people think your words are true. It doesn't matter what you do. I sold my soul to get here. How about you?. So please don't take offense. This is just a point of view. 'Cause I'm the only one who. Will say these things to you. Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. Ande learns to walk through life themselves. Not everything in life is handed on a plate. When people think your words are true. It doesn't matter what you do. I sold my soul to get here. How about you?

it's been awhile,"It's been a while. Since I could.... Hold my head up high. It's been a while. Since I first saw you. It's been a while. Since I could stand. on my own two feet again. And it's been a while. Since I could call you. But everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem. The consequences that I've rendered. Have stretched myself beyond my means. It's been a while. Since I could say. that I wasn't addicted. It's been a while. Since I could say. I loved myself as well and.... It's been a while. Since I've gone and fucked things up. Just like I always do. It's been a while. But all that shit seems to disappear. When I'm with you. And everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem. Consequences that I've rendered. Gone and fucked things up again... again. Why must I feel this way?. Just make this go away. Just one more peaceful day. It's been a while. Since I could.... Look at myself straight. It's been a while. Since I said I'm sorry. It's been a while. Since I've seen the way. the candles light your face. It's been a while. But I can still. remember just the way you taste. Everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem to be,. I know it's me. I cannot blame this on my father. He did the best he could for me. It's been a while. Since I could.... Hold my head up high. It's been a while. Since I said I'm sorry"
just go,I'm kinda numb. It's so distorted. You've left me here with. This damage that you've caused. My tortured faces. Those fucked up places. In my memories. None of them I've lost. But. I haven't been here long enough to know. Every time I feel this I just loose control. Such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful. I wish that this would just go. It's kinda sick. I feel so dirty. I'm kinda tragic. I'm kinda insecure. But I know. That I'm the only. One that can fix. Whatever's wrong I'm sure. But. I feel so numb. From all I've become. I'll take you down. I feel so down. I'm water while you drown. You're lifted while I'm down. I'm cancer in your womb. I'm the needle in your spoon. But.
king of all excuses,"Staind - King of All Excuses. You, I trusted your intentions. A trust you took advantage of. Now you are sitting in the hole that you dug around yourself.... [Chorus]. You've lied so much you think it's true. Do you know what the truth is?. How does someone get to be like you?. The king of all excuses.... Is she your partner in deception, or caught inside the web you’ve spun?. Did you forget that you were family, the damage you have done.... [Chorus]. You've lied so much you think it's true. Do you know what the truth is?. How does someone get to be like you?. The king of all excuses.... I trusted you. I trusted in you.... [Chorus]. You've lied so much you think it's true. Do you know what the truth is?. How does someone get to be like you?. The king of all excuses.... Everything must come full circle,. It kills me that I feel this hurtful,. I wonder what your children think of you,. The king of all excuses...."
layne,"i heard today that you were gone. i had to stop and sing along. the song they played to say goodbye. a song they gave, give me back life. [chorus]. you'll never fade. the words you gave. my life you saved. your name was layne. and on that day a child was born. to someone who you helped along. and helped see through his darkest times. because of you, this child she is mine.

So now I stand here. to sing another song for you. About the pain I felt before. Now there's nothing I can do. Now I stand here. with nothing left to say to you. And if you all could sing along. it might help me make it through. I try to move on. nothin' left to hurt me now. I hope it's all in the past to stay. Just tryin' to see through. all the fucked up shit we do. and hope that we all don't drift away. So now I stand here. to sing another song for you. About the pain I felt before. Now there's nothing I can do. Now I stand here. with nothing left to say to you. And if you all could sing along. it might help me make it through. So let it all out. Nothin' left to hold on to.

lost along the way,We change the rhyme forget the reason. Waiting for the change of seasons. Drawing near it's almost here. So save tonight forget tomorrow. So say goodbye to time we borrow. It's always there it's in the air. Like voices in the rain. Like a song without a name. Like angels wings and whisperings. Of love we've lost and found along the way. Do you take the time to really wallow. In the footsteps that you follow. Gets you there gets you anywhere. So here today and gone tomorrow. With the time you had to borrow. It's always there it's in the air. Like voices in the rain. Like a song without a name. Like angels wings and whisperings. Of love we've lost and found along the way. Like voices in the rain. Like a song without a name. Like angels wings and whisperings. Of love we've lost and found out in the rain. Like a song without a name. It washes it all away. Like the moments we could have saved. The things we forgot to say. Like a song without a name. Like angels wings and whisperings of love we've lost. Of love we've lost and found along the way. We've found along the way
me,I hear you talk about your family life. I wish I knew just what that means. I guess my mother never loved my dad. And now I wear it on my sleeve. My sister called me just the other day. It felt so good to hear her voice. My problem is I don't have much to say. I guess she doesn't have a choice. And I'm sorry. Look at me. I'm so pathetic. Can't Believe. I'm just an addict. I never needed anyone to help me I begging you. To please come save me from myself. Save me from my.... My mother's always tried to change herself. She never learned to let things be. She doesn't know how bad she messed me up. Cause now she seems so fake to me. But I Love Her. You push me but I won't fall. I've been programmed to take it all. And shove it way down inside. Like my father. I'm so pathetic. Can't believe. I'm just an addict. I try to be. I'm failing at it. Life to me. Is just a habit. I hear you talk about your family life. I wish I knew just what that means.

nutshell,"We chase misprinted lies. We face the path of time. And yet, I fight. And yet, I fight. This battle all alone. No one to cry to. No place to call home. Oooh...oooh.... Oooh...oooh....

open wide,Are you hungry?. Or is your conscience full?. Does it make you lonely. To have these shoes to fill?. Open wide and remember. All the shit they feed you. What's the point in believing. All the lies? They free you. From your thoughts of submission. Blow you into slumber. Sleepy eyes cannot see. Are we growing?. Or are we caving in. With the smoke you're blowing. Damaging my skin?. Open wide and remember. All the shit they feed you. What's the point in believing. All the lies they feed you. From your thoughts of submission. Blow you into slumber. Sleepy eyes cannot see.

Sleepy eyes cannot see
open your eyes,"As I walk along these streets. I see a man that walks alone. Distant echo of people's feet. He has no place to call his own. A shot rings out from a roof overhead. A crackhead asks for change nearby. An old man lies in an alleyway dead. A little girl lost just stands there and cries. What would you do, if it was you. Would you take everything. For granted like you do. A boy just 13 on the corner for sale. Swallows his pride for another hit. Overpopulation there's no room in jail. But most of you don't give a shit. That your daughters are porno stars. And your sons sell death to kids. You're so lost in your little worlds. Your little worlds you'll never fix. What would you do, if it was you. Would you take everything. For granted like you do. You turn away (x4). As I walk along the streets. Soaking up the acid rain. Underneath the taxi cabs. I hear the streets cry out in vain. What would you do, if it was you. Would you take everything. For granted like you do"
outside,"And you can bring me to my knees...Again. All the times when I could beg you please....In vain. All the times when I felt insecure....For you. And I leave my burdens at the door.

All the times that I felt like this won't end. It`s for you. And I taste what I could never have. It was from you. All the times that I've cried. My intentions, full of pride. But I waste more time than anyone. But I'm on the outside. I'm looking in. I can see through you. See your true colors. Inside you're ugly. You're ugly like me. I can see through you. See to the real you. All the times that I've cried. All this wasted, it's all inside. And I feel, all this pain. Stuffed it down, it's back again. And I lie, here in bed. All alone, I can't mend. But I feel, tomorrow will be okay. But I'm on the outside. And I'm looking in. I can see through you. See your true colors. Inside you're ugly. You're ugly like me. I can see through you. See to the real you"

paper jesus,Staind - Paper Jesus. You take this all for granted. All the things they used to feed you. By keeping you distracted. Just long enough to feed you. (Chorus). A reason for your anger.

Is what I need Is what I need. question what they tell you. all the lies that they are teaching. and they made a corporation. out of desperate people's feelings. (Chorus). Somebody chose these words for you. Interpretations of the truth. Somewhere behind your fear they hide. To fill the holes inside. (Chorus).

pardon me,I'm one step from a breakdown. Two steps from being safe. Just try to see this through. I'm three steps from this nightmare. And four steps from the door. The rest is up to you. Pardon me while I just turn my back and walk away. Pardon me if I can't listen to the things you say. Pardon me if I can't fake it. While you still believe. Pardon me. I'm one step from forgiveness. And two steps from my grave. We're all just passing through. Three steps from redemption. Four from the devil's door. On a path that leads to you. Pardon me while I just turn my back and walk away. Pardon me if I can't listen to the things you say. Pardon me if I can't fake it. While you still believe. Pardon me. Pardon me while I just turn my back and walk away. Pardon me if I can't listen to the things you say. Pardon me if I can't fake it. While you still believe. Pardon me. I'm two steps from salvation. But I'm only taking one. Pardon me

rainy day parade,"You the great pretenders. Learn to paint your pictures. While you're stepping over. Fallen people. Laying in the streets. You the great offenders. Only your views matter. While your heart grows colder. I wish that you could. Open up and feel. For a while. See if you can take it. Feel, your alive and this is all part of it. Feel, could it be that we're all afraid. 'cause it feels. Like a rainy day parade. We the great believers. Blood is legal tender. And I will not surrender. What it was our fathers. Died to bear. We the people stated. Not negotiated. Just to be forgotten. I wish that you could. Open up and see. For a while. See if you can take it. See, your alive this is all. Part of it. See, can't you see. That we're all afraid. 'cause it seems. Like a rainy day parade. What I see. Is all to real. What I need. Is what you steal. And all I reap. Is what you take. Upon my back. On which you break. And I just wish. That we could. Rise above this. Feel. For a while. See if you can take it. Feel, your alive and this is all part of it. Feel, could it be that we're all afraid. 'cause it feels. Like a rainy day parade"

reality,"The lights are on but you're not home. You've drifted off somewhere alone. Somewhere that's safe,. No questions here. A quiet place where you hide from your fears. [chorus]. Sometimes when you're out of rope. The way to climb back up's unclear. The walls you build around yourself. I guess they also keep you here. Are you afraid of what they think?. Whoever they happen to be. Or are you hiding from the scars of your own reality?. So you sedate and drown in vain. You've got a pill for every day. A suit and tie to mask the truth. It's ugly head is starting to show through. [chorus]. [bridge]. The monster you're feeding,. Your lack of perception. The things that you do. To fullfill your addictions. The light at the end of your tunnel is closing. What is it that you're so afraid of exposing?. You'd give it all up for what's there for the taking. Whatever it takes to keep your hands from shaking. The same things you're thinking might make you feel better. The same things that probably got you here. [chorus]. [bridge]"
reply,I have seen. Too many sad eyes look at me. The eyes that set me free. All the places that I've been. Thank you for. The letters that you thought you wrote in vain. And for.

Tell the story of your pain. Severity of your disdain. In a world that doesn't care. So thank you for. The letters that you thought you wrote in vain. And for. The times you chose to stand out in the rain. And wait. You. You understand my pain. From this I gather strength. In that we are the same. So thank you for. The letters that you thought you wrote in vain. And for. The times you chose to stand out in the rain. And wait. The life I live would never be the same. Without you here. You here. You here. Without you here
right here,I know I've been mistaken. But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made. I've got some imperfections. But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face. But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting. You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting. And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting. Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting. I hope you're not intending. To be so condescending it's as much as I can take. and you're so independent. you just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break. But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting. You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting. And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting. Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting.

You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting. And if I chose to walk away woul'd you be right here waiting. Searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting
run away,"I'm still scared. Afraid of failing. Anticipating, the ride to end.. before the wheels begin to move.. (Run away) So I can hide.. (Run away) I've mastered feeling nothing..

(Run away) I've mastered feeling nothing.. (Run away) I'm dead inside.. (Run away) Why don't I care?. The truth is that I'm not so good. At showing how I feel.. Or keeping my mouth shut. When there's something to conceal.. Or knowing how to love,. Love's not in my memories. How can I rise above. All my insecurities. (Run away) So I can hide.. (Run away) I've mastered feeling nothing.. (Run away) I'm dead inside.. (Run away) Why don't I care?. (Run away) I fight the tide. (Run away) The ebb and flow consuming. (Run away) Still by my side. (Run away) Why should you care?"
safe place,"Another day inside my world. I'm married to you and this road. A road that never lets me sleep. And there's no way to escape. These demons I'm forced to keep. And then I find. You here. Through your eyes. Everything's clear. And I fall. Inside your arms. But I'm alone for now. I mean the best with what I say. It doesn't always sound that way. I never learned to work things out.

schizophrenic conversations,"Are you afraid. Afraid of the truth. In mirrors staring back at you. the image is cracked. but so is the view, yeah. and the strength of a tree. begins in the roots. that I tenderly buried into you. At least now the storm. Can blow me away. (Chorus). So crawl inside. my head with me. I'll show you how. it feels to be. To blame like me. Should I be afraid. Of this face that I see. In the mirror staring back at me. So cold were the days. When I listened to you. And you SAY THAT I'M WEAK!. So show me the proof. Because I still exist in spite of you. But I won't compete. With you every day. (Chorus). Schizophrenic conversations. that I'm always having with myself. I hear these. voices in my head competing maybe I could use a little help. I still have schizophrenic conversations when there's no one else around to hear. And I long for solitude and peace within me. Pouring out all the anger and the fear. So crawl inside. My head with me. And I'll show you how it feels to be. Fucked up like me. I'll show you how it feels to be. To blame like me. And change like me"

Alone, no one to blame but me. But if you had told me when I was much younger. That life has a way of pulling you right under. I wouldn't be standing here preaching my hate. I stand at the edge staring into my fate. CHORUS:. I see thru you. What makes you think that you're god. Pick up the pieces as I fall apart. Why must you fuck with me. Betrayed, You left me here for dead. Betrayed, By the voices in my head. Betrayed, left my out in the rain. Betrayed, nothing left but pain. I'm sick of the answers. Your cannibal instincts and false dedications. You leave me here cold, nothing left but my shell. To die while I'm living and burn in my hell. CHORUS. I pick you apart little by little. Till nothing is left but the look on your face. Once inside our I can get at what's inside. Beneath your facad I can see your discrase. The walls that you build up will crumble around you. The pain you will feel as you wither away. The sun though it comes up will warm you.... No longer."

something like me,Shards of broken pieces. shattered on the floor. its not enough to bleed. tears and angry voices. cracks around the door. no apologies. and every time you say you love me. I just have to stop and catch my breath. how can somebody love something like me. if you could only say your sorry. there is nothing in this world I can't forget. waiting here for you to set me free. toys and colored pencils. scattered on the floor. underneath my feet. you're always crying over nothing. you're always wanting more. you never go to sleep. but every time you say you love me. I just have to stop and catch my breath. how can somebody love something like me. and every time I feel im falling. she'll be there to save me from myself. little angel watching over me. our taxis in the driveway. our bags are at the door. and it still kills me to leave. but every time you say you love me. I just have to stop and catch my breath. how can somebody love something like me. and every time I feel im falling. your the one's who saved me from myself. you give me something to believe. and with you here. these cracks and tears. fade away
something to remind you,So this is it I say goodbye. To this chapter of my every changing life. And there's mistakes and the path is long. And I'm sure I'll answer for them when I'm gone. So when the day comes in the sun won't touch my face. Tell the ones who cared enough that I finally left this place. That's been so cold look at my face. All the stories it will tell I can't erase. The road is long. Just one more song. A little something to remind you when I'm gone. When I'm gone. The road to hell along the way. Is paved with good intentions so they say. And some believe that no good deed. Goes unpunished in the end or so it seems. So when the day comes in the sun won't touch my face. Tell the ones who cared enough that I finally left this place. That's been so cold look at my face. All the stories it will tell I can't erase. The road is long. Just one more song. A little something to remind you when I'm gone. When I'm gone. So this is it I say goodbye. To this chapter of my every changing life. And there's mistakes and the path is long. And I'm sure I'll answer for them when I'm gone

take a breath,You can take all things you think I need. All I wear upon my sleeve. All the ways you perceive. I no longer need it. And I know what it means in black and white. God wanted me and that's why. You leave on the edge of sanity. There's not much left. Just take a breath. You play me out as mediocrity. Put to the test. Just take a breath. And me I just take things as they come. I stick around until it's done. And I'm not your chosen one. But can you admit it. And I know what it means in black and white. God wanted me and that's why. You leave on the edge of sanity. There's not much left. Just take a breath. You play me out as mediocrity. Put to the test. Just take a breath. You can take all the things you think I need.

The pain in you this pain in me - in me. everything that I can. say to you won't help you. everything you need is right. in front of you - just take it. I know that I am really not here. To represent what I am not clear. About in my head sometimes I feel. Fucked up just like you do - like you do. Try to make it through the daily pain that you feel. maybe tomorrow won't be so bad. I know it 'cause - I once felt. that way nothing I could say. Made it go away I lived through this. I still feel this I just live for my tomorrow. Just make it go away, Just make it go away. She'll make it go away, She'll make it go away"
take this,"""Take This"". I can't believe how far I've come. Watch me stumble and come undone. If you take away, these memories. All that's left, is just me. [chorus]. 'Cause I don't want this. And I don't need this. And I don't feel this. It seems that even though she's with me. I can't shake this. I can't fake this. And I won't take this anymore. So you choose to break my heart. I should have seen this from the start. I'm haunted by your apathy. All that's left is killing me. (chorus). Do you believe that the way you choose to be. I've always had to see. The brighter side of this so I don't lose my faith. Now the sun has gone away. It's getting colder everyday. So before I freeze to death there's something I should say. (chorus). And though you say you understand. You still won't face this. Can't erase this. I won't embrace this anymore"
tangled up in you,"You're my world, the shelter from the rain. You're the pills that take away my pain. You're the light that helps me find my way. You're the words when I have nothing to say. And in this world where nothing else is true. Here I'm still tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you. Still tangled up in you. You're the fire that warms me when I'm cold. You're the hand I have to hold as I grow old. You're the shore when I'm lost at sea. You're the only thing that I like about me. And in this world where nothing else is true. Here I'm still tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you. How long has it been since this storyline began. And I hope it never ends and goes like this forever. In this world where nothing else is true. Here I'm still tangled up in you, tangled up in you. I'm still tangled up in you. Still tangled up in you"
the bottom,You suffocate. You cannot wait. For this to just be over. You wanna run. And just be done. But what u cant control is. What your thinking. The ship is sinking!. I'll meet you at the bottom. The waves cant wash away all the scars you bear. See you at the bottom. You just hold on to the things that keep you here. You suffer the cost. When all this is lost. It just doesnt make sense to go there. All the hate that you fear. It slowly appears. Back into your life no controlling. (Don't know) what your thinking. The ship is sinking!. I'll meet you at the bottom. The waves cant wash away all the scars you bear. See you at the bottom. You just hold on to the things that keep you here. Fight. Just fucking stand for something. Lie. Youll never take us all. You'll never get it right. You'll never get it right. We'll always stand and fight. You'll never get it right. Its cold down here at the bottom. I'll meet you at the bottom. The waves cant wash all the scars you bear. See you at the bottom. You just hold on to the things that keep you here
the corner,It sheltered me from nothing but the weather. I called it home for a moment of my life. This place I see just doesn't look familiar. I wonder if it looks the same inside. So there's the corner that I sat on. The road I walked home in the rain. And there's the star I used to wish on. It all just seems like yesterday. Days go by. Nothing's getting clearer. Can't change my mind. My troubles are the same. Faces change. The names they are familiar. And the streets I see. Will stand the test of time. So there's the corner that I sat on. The road I walked home in the rain. And there's the star I used to wish on. It all just seems like yesterday. And those stars. Stars still shine. Shine down through the rain. And there's the corner that I sat on. The road I walked home in the rain. And there's the star I used to wish on. It all just seems like yesterday. And I stare out this dirty window. As this world goes slowly by. And somewhere out there is the future. That I once thought had passed me by. Sheltered me from nothing but the weather

But you don't care.. I don't know why I keep on calling. Doesn't get us anywhere.. Every time I try to speak,. you never let my words come out..

I don't know how you could see. Something you once saw in me. Just another volunteer. to wonder if you ever lie awake in bed. and think about the things you said. Your dedication shows, but you can't see. your eyes are closed. And all the promises you made. to me, they seem to fade. and leave me with this dissapointment,. that these words could never show. When the ride is over and you're hanging by a thread, as your house of cards is falling, just remember what I said.. So when did you decide to embrace what you hate to survive?. Cause that's not what got us here.. And honestly.... I don't know how you could see. something you once saw in me. Just another volunteer for you to blame"

The way a father should love his daughter. Sweet Zoe Jane. So I wanted to say this. 'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin. To explain to you what I have been through. To explain where your daddy has been. I want to hold you. Protect you from all of the things I've already endured. And I want to show you. To show you all the things that this life has in store for you. I'll always love you. The way a father should love his daughter. Sweet Zoe Jane
