the worst part of making changes,"These past few days, I've been thinking about a change. of my manner and the person I used to be. Looking in your eyes I can't recognize your face. My own promises don't let me go away. For many times I've been your best side, now said (Please stay away from me). Your tides of lies. Stole my sunrise. And your disguise. Is not worth the try. I've wait all this time to stay by your side. but I sing all this to let you know: I'm better on my own. You know my heart is broken, can you help me find it's pieces?. My head is exploding, I've lost my memories. Our story is going to hell, so please take your blame. I'm breaking out today, so just forget my name. For many times I've been your best side, I said (Please stay away from me). Your tides of lies. Stole my sunrise. And your disguise. Is not worth the try. For many times I've been your best side, now I said. Your tides of lies. Stole my sunrise. And your disguise. Is not worth the try"
