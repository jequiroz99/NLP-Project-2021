the bigger the love,There goes my baby walkin' out the door. I never cried a bigger tear before. You don't know 'till it breaks. How much a heart can take. You don't know pain until it burns inside. I should have picked on a love my. own size. How could a love so strong. Turn out to be so wrong. The bigger the love the harder the fall. When I lost your love I lost it all. I never hit the ground. Until you shot me down. The bigger the love the harder the fall. If I had known you'd be too much for me. I would have kept you as my fantasy. To get you off my mind I'm gonna need. some time. The bigger the love the harder the fall. When I lost your love I lost it all. I never hit the ground until you shot. me down. The bigger the love the harder the fall. The bigger the love the harder the fall. When I lost your love I lost it all. I never hit the ground until you shot. me down. The bigger the love the harder the fall

the edge of love,"Written by Billy Burnette and Robb Royer.. . Well love's an ocean, deep and wide. Too big to see the other side. What's waiting there for me and you. Out in the blue. We'll never know until we try. It may be a rough and raging sea. That goes on for eternity. Throw your caution to the wind. Sink or swim. Just jump in and?. (chorus). Let me rock you on the water. Where the winds of passion blow. If we go drifting out too far. We'll follow the brightest star. To the edge of love. Let me take you to another world. Where you an feel the undertow. And if that's getting in too deep. Just come with me at least. To the edge of love. Honey, let's just ride the wave. And let it carry us away. Let your heart just be your guide. I'll be there right by your side. Don't be afraid. We can tell each other's history. And leave the rest to mystery. We may never understand. Hold on tight, take my hand and?. (repeat chorus). ."
the last war song,"Written by Billy Burnette.. . Oh go now and tell the world about it. Stop this show now. There's too few here to die. We don't want war now. Just go on out and shout it. We've tried so many times to change directions. We've even tried some peaceful demonstrations. I wish this could be. Oh, I wish this could be the last war song. Well I just don't know. Leaders never listen. To anyone you know. They have so many reasons. Telling you the score. And make it sound confusing. Have a war trying to earn your perfection. I wish I could just lose all connection. I wish this could be. I wish this could be the last war song. ."
to get next to you,"Written by Billy Burnette and Chris Rodriguez.. . First night I saw you it was clear to me. You were surrounded in mystery. Just one look drew me in. Haven't been the same since. You had me hooked right from the start. Lights went out and the room went dark. Though I was blind and could not see. Felt the heat so close to me. I never wanted anything quite so bad. You got something that I never had. I'd climb those mountains, swim these seas. There ain't nothing in the world that I would not do. To get next to you. If I were wise I'd be more cool. I'm not the kind to play the fool. You got me where I just can't think. Like a puppet on a string. Can't remember ever feeling this. I'd give it all for just one kiss. Coming or going I can hardly tell. You got me underneath your spell. I never wanted anything quite so bad. You got something that I never had. I'd climb those mountains, swim these seas. There ain't nothing in the world that I would not do. To get next to you. ."

I didn't know you felt that way. Baby we can try another day. But this time (Repeat). Too bad I missed you baby. Too bad it might of been fun. Too bad I missed you baby. I think you're number one (Repeat). You are not at all what you think you are. A fine looking woman you may be. But loving you is hard. Just go on take your good looks. Cause they don't mean a thing to me no more. .
too much information,Written by Billy Burnette.. . Well I heard that since you said we're through. You bought some brand new dancin' shoes. That's all I've been hearin' about. All day long day in day out. That's too much too much information. I heard you fell in love but now he's gone. You love 'em then you just move on. Breakin' hearts everywhere. Acting like you just don't care. It's too much too much information. That's too much?. I heard that just the other night. You caused a knock down jealous fight. Over just you being a tease. Like you used to do to me. That's too much too much information. That's too much?. I hear you been telling all my friends. 'Bout how you're never coming back again. I know the news is second hand. But it's more than I can stand. It's too much too much information. That's too much?. .
"twenty years ago, today","Written by Billy Burnette.. . Seems like this is gonna be one of those days. I feel if as I reach the door. The sun is covered by that same. Old man-made haze. California lives no more. I can't believe it's just been twenty years ago. A lot of people got surprised. Over-crowded cities, not a problem anymore. The end is near, we realize. So help! We need somebody not some artificial mind. We've come across so many things. We thought we'd never find. Haley's Comet's gone. We're barely holding on. Jesus come on back and take us all home. ."
what a woman feels,"Written by Billy Burnette, Annie Roboff, and Dennis Morgan.. . First time I saw you, had that one thing on my mind. How to be a better person, be a little more kind. First time you saw me, had that look on your face. Wonderin' was I worth it, or would I be a big mistake. Mystery eyes starin' back at me. With the answer to the question of eternity. (chorus). What a woman feels. You will never know. What a woman feels. She'll keepit inside her soul. Until she feels that you're for real. Then I walked up to you, that's been a while ago. I've learned so much from you,. On our journey down this road. Well you showed me how to laugh. And you taught me how to cry. When to hold you tight, when to let you fly. Thought I knew my way around this big old world. Oh, what I've learned since I loved you girl. (repeat chorus). (bridge). Now I wanna listen. When you got something weighin' on your heart. I'd been missin' it. Thinkin' I was so smart. (repeat chorus). ."

I know a place we can't be found. Whatcha gonna do when the sun. goes down. I've been savin' my favorite shirt. Savin' it up for a Friday night. This time I'm gonna make it work. Gonna make it work with all my might. So whatcha gonna do when the sun. goes down. Hop in my back seat way out of town. I know a place we can't be found. Whatcha gonna do when the sun. goes down.
