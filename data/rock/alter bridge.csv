watch over you,"Leaves are on the ground. Fall has come. Blue sky's turning grey. Like my love. I tried to carry you. And make you whole. But it was never enough. I must go. And who is gonna save you when I'm gone?. And who'll watch over you when I'm gone?. You say you care for me. But hide it well. How can you love someone. And not yourself?. And who is gonna save you, when I'm gone?. And who'll watch over you, when I'm gone?. And when I'm gone who break your fall?. Who will you blame?. I can't go on. And let you lose it all. It's more than I can take. Who'll ease your pain?. Ease your pain. Who is gonna save you when I'm gone?. Who'll watch over you?. Who will give you strength when you're not strong?. Who'll watch over you when I've gone away?. Snow is on the ground. Winters come. You long to hear my voice. But I'm long gone"
in loving memory,"Thanks for all you've done. I've missed you for so long. I can't believe you're gone. You still live in me. I feel you in the wind. You guide me constantly. I've never knew what it was to be alone, no. Cause you were always there for me. You were always there waiting. And I'll come home and I miss your face so. Smiling down on me. I close my eyes to see. And I know, you're a part of me. And it's your song that sets me free. I sing it while I feel I can't hold on. I sing tonight cause it comforts me. I carry the things that remind me of you. In loving memory of. The one that was so true. Your were as kind as you could be. And even though you're gone. You still mean the world to me. I've never knew what it was to be alone, no. Cause you were always there for me. You were always there waiting. But now I come home and it's not the same, no. It feels empty and alone. I can't believe you're gone. And I know, you're a part of me. And it's your song that sets me free. I sing it while I feel I can't hold on. I sing tonight cause it comforts me. I'm glad he set you free from sorrow. I'll still love you more tomorrow. And you will be here with me still. And what you did you did with feeling. And You always found the meaning. And you always will. And you always will. And you always will. Ooo's. And I know, you're a part of me. And it's your song that sets me free. I sing it while I feel I can't hold on. I sing tonight cause it comforts me"
open your eyes,Looking back I clearly see. What it is that's killing me. Through the eyes of one I know. I see a vision once let go. I had it all. Constantly it burdens me. Hard to trust and can't believe. Lost the faith and lost the love. When the day is done. Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. On and on we stand alone. Until our day is gone. When they open their eyes. And realize we are one. I love the way I feel today. How I know the sun will fade. Darker days seem to be. What will always live in me. But still I run. It's hard to walk this path alone. Hard to know which way to go. Will I ever save this day. Will it ever change. Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. Still today we carry on. I know our day will come. When they open their eyes. And realize we are one. Oooooooh..... (solo de guitarra). Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. (its hard to walk this path alone. hard to know which way to go). Will they open their eyes. and realize we are one. (lost the faith and lost the love. when the day is done). Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one
blackbird,The willow it weeps today. A breeze from the distance is calling your name. Unfurl your black wings and wait. Across the horizon it's coming to sweep you away. It's coming to sweep you away. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. The fragile cannot endure. The wrecked and the jaded a place so impure. The static of this cruel world. Cause some birds to fly long before they've seen their day. Long before they've seen their day. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. Beyond the suffering you've known. I hope you find your way. May you never be broken again. Ascend may you find no resistance. Know that you made such a difference. All you leave behind will live to the end. The cycle of suffering goes on. But the memories of you stay strong. Someday I too will fly and find you again. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. Beyond the suffering you've known. I hope you find your way. May you never be broken again. May you never be broken again
broken wings,"Fight the fight alone. When the world is full of victims. Dims a fading light in our souls. Leave the peace alone. How we all are slowly changing. Dims a fading light in our souls. In my opinion seeing is to know. The things we hold are always first to go. And who's to say we won't end up alone. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning. By the fires of the sun. On skinned knees I'm bleeding. And it won't be long. I've got to find that meaning. That I've searched for so long. Cry ourselves to sleep. We will sleep alone forever. Will you lay me down in the same place with all I love?. Mend the broken homes. Care for them, they are our brothers. Save the fading light in our souls. In my opinion seeing is to know. What you give will always carry you. And who's to say we won't survive it too. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning. By the fires of the sun. On skinned knees I'm bleeding. And it won't be long. I've got to find that meaning. That I've searched for so long. Set a-free all. Relying on their will to make me all that I am. And all that I'll be. Set a-free all. Will fall between the cracks with memories of all that I am. And all that I'll be. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning. By the fires of the sun. On skinned knees I'm bleeding. And it won't be long. I've got to find that meaning. That I've searched for so long"

To every fool with an opinion. They never break. Oh...by the way. We scream to find a reason. Never doubt or stop believing. And escape. There's nothing we should have to fear. It's alright we've come to life. I'll never shed another tear. It's alright we've come to life. Wicked tongues can speak. And rewrite history. But you can't keep the truth contained.

before tomorrow comes,I couldn't sleep I had to listen. To a conscience knowing so well. That nothing comes from indifference. I look inside of myself. Will I find some kind of conviction?. Will I bid the hero farewell?. Will I be defined by things that could have been?. I guess time will only tell. I guess time will only tell. [Chorus:]. So don't let it be. Before tomorrow comes. Before you turn away. Take the hand in need. Before tomorrow comes. You could change everything. I curse my worth and every comfort. That blinded me for way too long. Damn it all I'll make a difference from now on. Cause I'm wide awake to it all. Cause I'm wide awake to it all. [Chorus]. Does anyone care it ain't right what we're doing?. Does anyone care it ain't right where we're going?. Does anyone dare justify how we're living?. Does anyone here care at all?. [Chorus]. We could be so much more than we are. We could be so much more than we are. We could be so much more than we are. Oh this much I know
words darker than their wings,They say you are right. I hope that I'm wrong. I know that you tried. But still it is gone. Just don't you lose hope. I swear I never dream that we're alone. Now don't you let go. I swear I still believe though I don't know. Remember the years. I still walked tall. I only fear. Now I only crawl. How could I be wrong?. I hope there comes a day your fear is gone. How could we be lost?. Lost just seize to be not carry on. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. You can love someone. Go never to ask why. Or to fear again.

I will fight the end. Till the end is here. The end is here. The end is here. The end is here. The end is here. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. That were always here.

slip to the void,"Slip to the void. To the dark. To the fall. Crawl to the life you shouldn't know. You should never come this way. To test the hands of fate. You don't belong here. Peal back the skin. Close your eyes, hell is born. To the abyss, but be warned. You fear what you've become. My God what have you done?. You don't belong here. But it's all in the way. You touch and you obey, denial. But it's all in the way. You touch and you obey, denial. Sever the ties. Trip the wire, dig your hole. Doubt is alive and you know. You were once led to believe. You were young and so naive. And now no longer. But it's all in the way. You turn your back today. Left to face this alone. Left to die with nothing you can own. Left to break in the cold. In the void that you made. The moment you let love go. Trying win back your days. You let them all escape your heart. Now that you've come so far. Why did you have to fall so hard?. Look at what you've done. What have you become?. Left to face this alone. Left to die with nothing you can own. Left to break in the cold. In the void that you made. The moment you let love go.... You let love go.... You let love go.... You let love go"

down to my last,To the ones in which we sing. We are honored you let us in. I remember the thoughts of many things. Of the glory that you bring. I was never the right one. To dare to dream. It's funny what this life has done to me now. You were always the only. To help me see that was a road I must find. A road that was mine. But I'm down to my last. I'm standing here alone. Looking back on it all. I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong and. I'm blind to it all. And to the ones in which we sing. Ones who tried to do us in. I remember your name and I know your face. I can't forgive and can't erase. I was never the right one. To bear the weight. Of something fueled by words I learned to hate. You were always the only. To help me see that to love is to shine. In your world I'm blind. But I'm down to my last. I'm standing here alone. Looking back on it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong and. I'm blind to it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm scared of it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm blind to it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm blind to it all. by Jordana Bonasina

find the real,Stuck in the middle. I burrow inside. Back to the cradle. Away from the burdens of all my crimes. Before it's fatal. My past has found me. The truth's come out. All is remembered.

I put on all my life. The face of an angel. But I look in the mirror. Only to find. The face of a stranger. And with all I've taken. I hunger for more. 'Cause I'm selfish. And all I'm left with is a crown of thorns. And I'm helpless. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real. I'll trade these lies for something right. I'll kill what hurts with something pure. I will be redeemed so I can breathe again. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love.

In time you're gonna lose it all. Cry out!. You're know it now!. She sold you out!. You're gonna lose it all!. You're addicted to pain. Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows. So addicted to face. In time you're gonna lose it all. You're addicted to pain. Sometimes it seems like nothing else matters. You're too addicted to face. In time you're gonna lose it all. Cry out!. You're know it now!. In time you're gonna lose it all. Cry out!. You're know it now!. You don't live it anymore"
all ends well,"If I could ease your mind, calm the storm inside. Pull your drifting heart back from a cruel and bitter tide. Show you that tomorrow everything will be just fine. Oh, in due time. Oh. Somewhere down the road, the stars will show. Somewhere down the road, you're almost home. You're almost home. (Chorus). If you believe in nothing else. Just keep believing in yourself. There will be times of trouble, it's gonna hurt like hell. This much I know, all ends well. It all ends well. If I could heal the scars. Show you what you are. Bind the wounds of disbelief. That brought you down so hard. I would be the tourniquet around your doubting heart. Oh, in due time. Oh. Somewhere down the road, the stars will show. Somewhere down the road, you're almost home. You're almost home. (Chorus). If you believe in nothing else. Just keep believing in yourself. There will be times of trouble, it's gonna hurt like hell. This much I know, all ends well. It all ends well. So hard to see, so hard to find. All that you need will come in time. These words of wisdom, do not ignore. You have so much to give once you live. Once you live a little more. (Chorus). If you believe in nothing else. Just keep believing in yourself. There will be times of trouble, it's gonna hurt like hell. This much I know, all ends well. It all ends well"
all hope is gone,"A tireless stream of indifference flows. Through veins till the river runs dry. I no longer care I have all but disposed. Of dreams that I once held inside. Desire is gone after all of these years. The fight has been lost I concede. The apathy born a long time ago. Has grown to what I can’t defeat, no. I’ve been here too long. I’m tired and longing for more. How long must I run. To find what I’m looking for?. All hope is gone. The sadness I carry so deep in my heart. For what could have been at my feet. It’s never forgotten, it’s never too far. I’m wasted so warn and so weak. I’ve been here too long. I’m tired and longing for more. How long must I run. To find what I’m looking for?. All hope is gone. Ahhh… ah ah. Ahhh… ah ah. Ahhh… ah ah. (All hope is gone…). Solo. I’ve been here too long. I’m tired and longing for more. How long must I run. To find what I’m looking for?. I’ve been here too long. I’m tired and longing for more. 3x All hope is gone"
before tomorrow comes,I couldn't sleep I had to listen. To a conscience knowing so well. That nothing comes from indifference. I look inside of myself. Will I find some kind of conviction?. Will I bid the hero farewell?. Will I be defined by things that could have been?. I guess time will only tell. I guess time will only tell. [Chorus:]. So don't let it be. Before tomorrow comes. Before you turn away. Take the hand in need. Before tomorrow comes. You could change everything. I curse my worth and every comfort. That blinded me for way too long. Damn it all I'll make a difference from now on. Cause I'm wide awake to it all. Cause I'm wide awake to it all. [Chorus]. Does anyone care it ain't right what we're doing?. Does anyone care it ain't right where we're going?. Does anyone dare justify how we're living?. Does anyone here care at all?. [Chorus]. We could be so much more than we are. We could be so much more than we are. We could be so much more than we are. Oh this much I know
blackbird,The willow it weeps today. A breeze from the distance is calling your name. Unfurl your black wings and wait. Across the horizon it's coming to sweep you away. It's coming to sweep you away. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. The fragile cannot endure. The wrecked and the jaded a place so impure. The static of this cruel world. Cause some birds to fly long before they've seen their day. Long before they've seen their day. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. Beyond the suffering you've known. I hope you find your way. May you never be broken again. Ascend may you find no resistance. Know that you made such a difference. All you leave behind will live to the end. The cycle of suffering goes on. But the memories of you stay strong. Someday I too will fly and find you again. Let the wind carry you home. Blackbird fly away. May you never be broken again. Beyond the suffering you've known. I hope you find your way. May you never be broken again. May you never be broken again
bleed it dry,"Oceans rise, summits fall. Fading fast, it won't be long. Everything will be consumed, rendered lost. At the hands of fools tomorrow's gone. So say goodbye. (chorus). Bleed it dry, leave us here with nothing. Justify all that you consume. Bleed it dry, what is this becoming?. All your lies serve no one but you. Blood machines burn the skies. Turning day into night. Everything will fade to dust again, weak or strong. So don't pretend you've done no wrong. 'cause you know that I'm right. Bleed it dry, leave us here with nothing. Justify all that you consume. Bleed it dry, what is this becoming?. All your lies serve no one but you. One day you will see what you've done. The world you chose to bleed will be dead and gone. Bleed it dry, leave us here with nothing. Justify all that you consume. Bleed it dry, what is this becoming?. All your lies serve no one but you. [x2]"
brand new start,"Against the sky, streams of light. Call out to me and you. We leave as one, we've just begun. To find the solace we're due. This is a life we must choose. We will make a brand new start. From the pieces torn apart. The break of day is before us. Cast your sorrows to the wind. Let the highway take us in. As we are escape the disorder. This desert road, that we call home. This is our destiny. We chase the setting sun, as we outrun. A life of agony. God how we ache to be free. We will make a brand new start. From the pieces torn apart. The break of day is before us. Cast your sorrows to the wind. Let the highway take us in. As we are escape the disorder. We'll make our way...."
break me down,It's too late the time has come. I've kept this inside me for way too long. Silence will leave me cold. Lost on a highway that never takes me home. [Chorus:]. I want to step aside. I want to give it up. Before I lose it all. It's tearing me inside. The way you break me down. Oh there will come a time. When I will come undone. And you will let me fall. I'll leave it all behind. Before you break me down. The weight of a thousand lies. Promises broken haunt me all the time. You say that you're sure to change. But that black heart reveals that. You'll always stay the same. [Chorus]. I realize. Forgiveness. Is calling. It's calling. I've denied. The reason. I'm falling. I'm falling. So let go. [Chorus]
breath,You were hungry for life. Then you took mine. Left me so hollow. And I was eager to play. To give you all of me. For what I will never know. Well I'll rest my eyes. And I'll let the earth breathe. And I'll bide my time. I'll let the earth breathe. You wiped the smile from our face. Our saving grace. Our lasting passion. And with a knife in our soul. We realize. We will not feel it. Well I'll rest my eyes. And I'll let the earth breathe. And I'll bide my time. I'll let the earth breathe. Well it's all I am. And it makes me feel at home. And I must be mad. And I must not care at all. Well I want my life. And I feel it taking on. 'cause it left me here. And it left me all alone. Well I'll rest my eyes. I'll let the earth breathe. And I'll bide my time. I'll let the earth breathe. Well I'll rest my eyes. I'll let the earth breathe. And I'll bide my time. I'll let the earth breathe
breathe again,"I…. I have played the part. I have all but lost my soul. And I have sacrificed for what it’s worth I just don’t know. In the silence of my heart there is a distant call. Yeah eah eah eah eah. It beckons me to stand apart. So I set out on my own. Just to breath again. Touch the light that calls me home. Just to reach the end. Where I'm free to breathe again…. Oh oh oh. Through the suffering. Through the misery and pain. Never anything but the will to see the day - yeah eah. When the promise might be born. Light the spark within. Yeah eah eah eah eah. Cause I can’t take it anymore. So I set out on my own. Just to breath again. Touch the light that calls me home. Just to reach the end. Well, I’m free to breathe again…. Well, I am free to roam. And set out on my own. To rise above the hands that try to hold me down. Before the end I know I’ll breathe again to find my way…. So I set out on my own. Just to breath again. Touch the light that calls me home. Just to reach the end. I’m leaving today.... I’m leaving today.... I’m leaving today..."
broken wings,"Fight the fight alone. When the world is full of victims. Dims a fading light in our souls. Leave the peace alone. How we all are slowly changing. Dims a fading light in our souls. In my opinion seeing is to know. The things we hold are always first to go. And who's to say we won't end up alone. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning. By the fires of the sun. On skinned knees I'm bleeding. And it won't be long. I've got to find that meaning. That I've searched for so long. Cry ourselves to sleep. We will sleep alone forever. Will you lay me down in the same place with all I love?. Mend the broken homes. Care for them, they are our brothers. Save the fading light in our souls. In my opinion seeing is to know. What you give will always carry you. And who's to say we won't survive it too. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning. By the fires of the sun. On skinned knees I'm bleeding. And it won't be long. I've got to find that meaning. That I've searched for so long. Set a-free all. Relying on their will to make me all that I am. And all that I'll be. Set a-free all. Will fall between the cracks with memories of all that I am. And all that I'll be. On broken wings I'm falling. And it won't be long. The skin on me is burning.

buried alive,I twist and turn. In the darkest space. Can't find my worth. As I numb the pain. Glass to the sky. With a blacktooth grin. This whiskey smile. Takes me down again. I'm cold and I'm so afraid. That I'm too weak and I can't change. I've been buried alive and. I don't want to be here anymore. Reached out a thousand times for. A hand to pull me from below. I've been buried alive in a world. Of constant sorrow. Reach down tonight and set me free.... Save tomorrow. Another shot. Slip into the haze. Another night. Soaked in my disgrace. Toast to the lie. I'll raise my glass and run. A wasted life. What have I become?. I've been buried alive and. I don't want to be here anymore. Save tomorrow. Save tomorrow. Let me breathe again. Show me where I begin. To find the will to change. Before I lose everything. I've been buried alive and. I don't want to be here anymore. Reach down tonight and set me free. And I will follow
burn it down,Drank so much last night. I think that I drowned. But now my cup is empty. No one has seen my will around. Now my heart is aching. Sometimes I fall asleep for days. But my bed is empty. I know I'm too set in my ways. Tell 'em all I'm okay. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on. Flew so high last night. I think that I fell. To the ground so heavy. Woke up to find this living hell. It used to be so easy. Hard to tell my nights. Now from my days. The curtains hide my feelings. Don't feel I have any right to pray. And will they find me someday. Someday. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on. And whatever takes us away. Will be the same to drive us on. And whatever takes us away. Will be the same to drive us on. Remember to find a new way. A way to see it all. It's finally slipping away. Soon it will be gone. Remember to find a new day. Remember to carry on. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on. So burn it down. Discover the dusk of your day. Has reached its dawn. So burn it down. Remember to find a new way. To carry on
calm the fire,"Calm the fire. Do not fight anymore. They don''t know what they''re saying. They don''t know anything at all. For all that matters is you know. That this is not their fault.

It''s been so long, it''s tearing me apart. I cannot understand or comprehend. Where we went wrong?. Now we''ve come so far. The madness in our hearts will never end. 'cause I''ve seen it all. I can''t fight it anymore. If I had burned forevermore. Is there nothing left to save?. (Chorus). 'cause now more than ever what we need. Is love to replace all the obscene.

And now you know you can''t deny. Only ignorance to blame. (Chorus). 'cause now more than ever what we need. Is love to replace all the obscene. Something good and something beautiful. if only we could see. That now more than ever what we need. Is a little love. Now let it calm the fire, that burns within your heart tonight.

coeur d'alene,When all the lights have faded. The encore’s come and gone. And I can’t take this no more. Well I can’t keep pretending. I just can’t play the part. I need the solace of her shore. I need the solace of her shore. Coeur d’Alene is calling out. And it won’t be long. Coeur d’Alene I’m coming now. Where I still belong. I look into the mirror. I don’t know who I am.

To every fool with an opinion. They never break. Oh...by the way. We scream to find a reason. Never doubt or stop believing. And escape. There's nothing we should have to fear. It's alright we've come to life. I'll never shed another tear. It's alright we've come to life. Wicked tongues can speak. And rewrite history. But you can't keep the truth contained. Like the song was sung. They'll realize we're one. And don't forget we're here to stay. There's nothing we should have to fear. It's alright we've come to life. I'll never shed another tear. It's alright we've come to life"
coming home,As I peel away. All the years of pain. I discovered what's been all along. You were so right. I was so wrong. Every shooting star. They all fall so hard.

I'm so alone. Far from the streets I call my own. I'm coming home. Rushing back to me. As the city sleeps. So afraid of what I will find. Memories they haunt. From deep inside. Every broken man. Comes to understand. that he'll never find paradise. When all that he wants. Was there all the time. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. [Chorus]. So I'm coming home. Lost on a road I don't belong. I'll rest my song. I'm so alone. Far from the streets I call my own. So I'm coming home. Back to a world left long ago. And now I know. I'm coming home. I'll find my way back. I'm letting go. I'm coming home. We come to find. What we take for granted. Keeps us alive in the end. So don't let time. Leave you empty handed. Reach out tonight and make amends. [Chorus]. So I'm coming home. Back to the place where I belong. I'll rest my song. I'm so alone. Far from the streets I call my own. So I'm coming home. Back to a world left long ago. Now I know. I'm coming home.

down to my last,To the ones in which we sing. We are honored you let us in. I remember the thoughts of many things. Of the glory that you bring. I was never the right one. To dare to dream. It's funny what this life has done to me now. You were always the only. To help me see that was a road I must find. A road that was mine. But I'm down to my last. I'm standing here alone. Looking back on it all. I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong and. I'm blind to it all. And to the ones in which we sing. Ones who tried to do us in. I remember your name and I know your face. I can't forgive and can't erase. I was never the right one. To bear the weight. Of something fueled by words I learned to hate. You were always the only. To help me see that to love is to shine. In your world I'm blind. But I'm down to my last. I'm standing here alone. Looking back on it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong and. I'm blind to it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm scared of it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm blind to it all. But I'm down to my last. I'm ready but I'm wrong. And I'm blind to it all. by Jordana Bonasina

find the real,Stuck in the middle. I burrow inside. Back to the cradle. Away from the burdens of all my crimes. Before it's fatal. My past has found me. The truth's come out. All is remembered. With no place to fall but straight down. I must surrender. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real. There's a face. I put on all my life. The face of an angel. But I look in the mirror. Only to find. The face of a stranger. And with all I've taken. I hunger for more. 'Cause I'm selfish. And all I'm left with is a crown of thorns. And I'm helpless. Well it seems I've finally thought of everything. I wanna love. I wanna feel. Find peace. Find the real.

She harbored so much hurt. She faced the world alone. She dropped out and just tore herself away. She was never born to follow. Dropped out of a world she couldn't take. She was never born to follow.

She dropped out and just tore herself away. She was never born to follow. Dropped out of a world she couldn't take. She was never born to follow. What else could be said?. What else could be done?. A life that slipped away. Should of, could of overcome. Still I miss her face. Brighter than the Sun. She had to find her way. She dared to dream. She dared to run. She dropped out and just tore herself away. She was never born to follow. Dropped out of a world she couldn't take. She was never born to follow"

open your eyes,Looking back I clearly see. What it is that's killing me. Through the eyes of one I know. I see a vision once let go. I had it all. Constantly it burdens me.

It's hard to walk this path alone. Hard to know which way to go. Will I ever save this day. Will it ever change. Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. Still today we carry on. I know our day will come. When they open their eyes. And realize we are one. Oooooooh..... (solo de guitarra). Will they open their eyes. And realize we are one. (its hard to walk this path alone. hard to know which way to go). Will they open their eyes. and realize we are one. (lost the faith and lost the love. when the day is done).

Far from home. Ohh. Ohh"
slip to the void,"Slip to the void. To the dark. To the fall. Crawl to the life you shouldn't know. You should never come this way. To test the hands of fate. You don't belong here. Peal back the skin. Close your eyes, hell is born. To the abyss, but be warned. You fear what you've become. My God what have you done?. You don't belong here. But it's all in the way. You touch and you obey, denial. But it's all in the way. You touch and you obey, denial. Sever the ties. Trip the wire, dig your hole. Doubt is alive and you know. You were once led to believe. You were young and so naive. And now no longer. But it's all in the way. You turn your back today. Left to face this alone. Left to die with nothing you can own. Left to break in the cold. In the void that you made. The moment you let love go. Trying win back your days. You let them all escape your heart. Now that you've come so far. Why did you have to fall so hard?. Look at what you've done. What have you become?. Left to face this alone. Left to die with nothing you can own. Left to break in the cold. In the void that you made. The moment you let love go.... You let love go.... You let love go.... You let love go"
solace,"When we drift with the tide. Are we gone forever?. And when will we find ourselves. I ask my soul, but it doesn't know. All those days, endless nights. Will we live forever?. Live with doubt in ourselves. I ask my soul, but I already know. I pray my days. Will bring me solace and I'll have faith. I'll find a way. To a better tomorrow, a better today. When we fall, gain new wounds. Will we bleed forever?. When we heal, will our scars. Reveal in ourselves all that's been done?. And who are we to believe. We laugh for nothing. And will we rise in the end. I ask my soul, I already know. I pray my days. Will bring me solace and I'll have faith. I'll find a way. To a better tomorrow, a better today. I'm gonna fight a revolution. On my own. I'm gonna look them in the eye. On my own. I'm gonna read the sign. My faith, it grows. No need to question, I already know. I've found a way. To a better tomorrow, a little today. I pray my days. Will bring me solace and I'll have faith. I'll find a way. To a better tomorrow, a little today"
still remains,I cast a line when I saw you were drowning. Still you turn your back on me. Pulled you from the fire when you were burning. Still you never could believe. So carry on if you must go your way. Though it breaks my heart. Your free will still remains. I save you from your fall when you were slipping. Still you broke from me to run. So how can you justify the life you're living. You must carry on if you must go your way. Though it breaks my heart. Your free will still remains. You'll deny. You'll deny me once again. But I've seen it all. I know you've come to crawl. Back to me before the end. Carry on if you must go your way. Though it breaks my heart. Your free will still remains. So carry on if you must go your way. Though it breaks my heart. Your free will still remains. Still remains
the damage done,I won’t waste away. I won’t let this take me down. I can’t survive. As long as I keep it around. I wish it would fade. But it will just sell me out. Over and over and over. I cried out loud. SOMEBODY SAVE ME…. SOMEBODY SAVE ME…. The Race I Run. I Keeps Me Focused On. The Man I Could Become. The Damage Done. I Want To Wash The Filth Away. Till There Is None. I run till I break. From the way it was killing me. Profuse to the day. I’ll suffer afraid to speak. I carry the shame. And beg for a remedy. How long must I live. With the damage of my disease. SOMEBODY SAVE ME…. SOMEBODY SAVE ME…. The Race I Run. I Keeps Me Focused On. The Man I Could Become. The Damage Done. I Want To Wash The Filth Away. Till There Is None. The Race I Run. I Keeps Me Focused On. The Man I Could Become. The Damage Done. I Want To Wash The Filth Away. Till There Is None
the end is here,Endless Days. We search for what we hold inside. So hard to find. Luck turns. will the fallen ever reach within. and rise again. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. that were always here. I will find the meaning this time. I will fight the end. Till the end is here. Wasted time. With words that seem to break our will. They bind us still. Without a care. they tarnish what we hold so dear. what was once so clear. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. That were always here. I will find the meaning this time. I will fight the end. Till the end is here. The end is here. The end is here. The end is here. The end is here. For the rest of my life. I will find the answers. That were always here. I will find the meaning this time. I will fight the end. Till the end is here
the last hero,"Can you hear the marching. Beating of the drums?. Once again the dogs are out for blood. Words and accusations, history revised. The time has gone to tell that you're alright. Oh how you tried. I know that you tried. To save us. Save us. I remember dreaming not so long ago. The change was gonna come. I still had hope. How long must I keep waiting. Feeling so ignored. Is anything worth saving anymore?. I just don't know. But need you so. Don't let us fall again. We can't fight this on our own. Who'll save us in the end. Have we lost our last hero?. Tyrants overtaking intoxicate with lies. There is no escaping, not this time. The simple man receiving, defending every crime. Somehow still believing they are right. So hypnotized. Don't let us fall again. We can't fight this on our own. Who'll save us in the end. Have we lost our last hero?. Tell me where are the heroes?. No. Tell me where are the heroes?. No, no. Have we lost all our heroes?. No. How could this be, we couldn't see. Now we are left here to fight this on our own. Build them up to tear them down. What we've done I'm far from proud. Chew 'em up. Spit 'em up. In the end. Who'll save us now?. Can you hear the marching, beating of the drums. Once again the dogs are out for blood. Words and accusations, history revised. The time has gone to tell that you're alright. Don't let us fall again. We can't fight this on our own. Who'll save us in the end. Have we lost our last hero?. Have we reached the end?. Are we last to know?. Are we still afraid?. Nowhere left to go. No, it's much too late. There's no hope to see. There is still a chance left. For you and me"
the other side,"Just step into the dark, it's waiting. Take your vow, it's time. Time for you to meet your maker. Playing God tonight. You're insane. Have you gone too far?. Who's to blame. For what you are?. If you believe yours is the only way. Then you're the fool who lives to die. Will you deserve the Hell you're gonna pay. On the other side. Once you reach the other side. Once you reach the other side. The trigger warm, anticipating. The ritual's begun. You think that Heaven's gates are waiting. But only Hell will come. You're insane. Have you gone too far?. Who's to blame. For what you are?. If you believe yours is the only way. Then you're the fool who lives to die. Will you deserve the Hell you're gonna pay?. On the other side. On the other side. Once you reach the other side. Fade to black, you'll see in time. You will only be denied. Fools will only be denied. There will be no paradise. Fools will only be denied. There will be no paradise. Yeah. If you believe yours is the only way. Then you're the fool who lives to die. Will you deserve the Hell you're gonna pay?. On the other side. On the other side. Once you reach the other side. Once you reach the other side. There will be no paradise. Once you reach the other side. There will be no paradise"
the univinted,"What was sacred lost forevermore. Once your hatred washed up to the shore. Underneath I still can feel the pain. What you took can never be replaced. Stone faced liar!. Your hate vile!. (Chorus). For the blood you waste, this will fall on you. Now your fate has been decided. For the life you take, this is overdue. You are now the uninvited. Sirens screaming blood against the wall. No more saving innocence at all. No shame, spineless!. Cold rage, violence!. (Chorus). For the blood you waste, this will fall on you. Now your fate has been decided. For the life you take, this is overdue. You are now the uninvited. Soon you'll feel all my agony. Soon you'll know it. All you feel will come to life and it won't be long. For tonight you are gonna know my pain. (Chorus). For the blood you waste, this will fall on you. Now your fate has been decided. For the life you take, this is overdue. You are now the uninvited. Stone faced liar!. Stone faced liar!"
the writing on the wall,"Don't tell us this is normal. Don't tell us there's no change. So selfish and immoral, you're to blame. 'cause you're the greatest rotter. Still crossing out of line. Now tell me who will suffer. For all your crimes?. We are running out of time. Out of time. And the writing's on the wall. That the end will begin. Still you do not fade at all. And keep denying the greatest sin. Ignore the truth and follow. Reap all that you sow. Spawn the future sorrow, we will know. Refusing every warning. Deny the rate of change. The ignorance is swarming, what a shame. And you know that you're to blame. You're to blame. And the writing's on the wall. That the end will begin. Still you do not fade at all. Throwing lies to the wind. And the writing's on the wall. So I say it again. Still you do not fade at all. And keep denying the greatest sin. You're the one to blame. For this rate of change. No tomorrow. When will you see?. And the writing's on the wall. That the end will begin. Still you do not fade at all. Throwing lies to the wind. And the writing's on the wall. So I say it again. Still you do not fade at all. And keep denying the greatest sin. The greatest sin. Deny it again. When will it end?"

We must receive. This side of fate is blind. The choice has been made, it is time. We had a dream, now it's gone. A future revealed. We were all so very wrong. We were all so wrong. This side of fate is blind. The choice has been made, it is time. What have we done?. There's nowhere to run. Is there some place?. We were so wrong, now we're lost. We can't go wrong until we are right. Don't say it's over, don't let us down. Don't turn away, we need you now. This side of fate, it is blind. The choice has been made, it is time. For all that we've done. Will we ever choose to see?. The fault of our own. This fate we must receive"
ties that bind,"I tear on the leash. That keeps me contained and controlled. Let me go. I want to break free. And bite my way out of this hole. One Last Hope. To Rise And Break Away. Above The Faded Line. Way Beyond The Ties That Bind. This I Know. The Risk Is Worth The Gain. It'S Worth The Sacrifice. Way Beyond The Ties That Bind. I run but the chains.

twilight,"The world has gone mad. The future is so unclear. Where do we stand?. It feels like the end is near. I remember everything you said. And what would come to be. A prophet of the future. Now the future is reality. Twilight. Where do we go? time is running out. We can't fight. Hope for a future worth saving now. One thing's for sure. We must accept and change. Or we in time. Will just have ourselves to blame. Divided by differences. Now everything is torn apart. Tomorrow is contingent on the tolerance. Of every heart. Twilight. Where do we go? time is running out. We can't fight. Hope for a future. Worth saving now. Will you show us. The way we should go?. I looked at the sky, praying for time. Hoping for what hasn't come. The dream's still alive. But the nightmare just won't come undone. The tyrants will rage. There's no time to waste. There's no telling what will become. If we don't sustain. Some hope from tomorrow. We'll learn. Twilight. Where do we go? time is running out. We can't fight. Hope for a future. Worth saving now. Twilight. Where will we go when it all comes down?. We can't fight. Hope for a future. Worth saving now. Will you show us. The way we should go?"

waters rising,"Now is the end of time. A fool and his legacy are gone. His pride found another way to make sure it all went wrong. Awaken a new day, our fears have come to pass. And this time, they're gonna last. This time they're gonna last. Don't let me drown!. Don't let me drown!. Now all of the fields are burning. It blocks out the Sun. I see all the water rising. To drown everyone. This is the season, we tear our rivals down. This circle of tyrants will end us all right now. The Earth has provided the means to burn it down. Well, don't you see it now?. Well, don't you see it now?. Don't let me drown!. Don't let me drown!. Now all of the fields are burning. It blocks out the sun. I see all the water rising. To drown everyone. This is tomorrows' way to end our days. Watch as the clouds, they gather now to wash us away. Water is rising coming to wash it all way. There's no denying we were so wrong. Water is rising coming to wash the filth away. There's no denying we are so lost. Staring down the end of time, every fear is realized. Crying out it's much too late, nothing we can do to save. For the time has come. Now all of the fields are burning. It blocks out the Sun. I see all the water rising. To drown everyone. This is tomorrow's way to end our days. Watch as the clouds, they gather now to wash us away. (Solo). (At the end of days, the end of days)"
wayward one,And they cry. And they call. As the wayward walk alone. City lights. Urban sprawl. In a place no one should know. Shown no grace. Shown no love. These mean streets are meant for none. [Chorus:]. Take them back to the start. Let the purest of heart. Know their worth is still spoken. As they fight to exist. We neglect and resist. Let this circle be broken. Broken homes. Broken lives. They repeat themselves in time. It's passed on. Down the line. Till we heal the wounds inside. It's not too late. To make things right. Dress wounds with loves pure light. [Chorus:]. Take them back to the start. Let the purest of heart. Know their worth is still spoken. As they fight to exist. We neglect and resist. Let this circle be broken. They're still waiting. They still cry. They still want to know they'll be all right. All I'm saying. Can we try?. To bring the wayward ones back home tonight. Bring the wayward one back home tonight. Take them back to the start. Let the purest of heart. Know their worth is still spoken
we don't care at all,Crack the heart with true intentions. Blood and scars and no redemption. We’ve been a slave to your disaster. Lost it all it doesn’t matter. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. Waste aways amount to nothing. But your opinions keep on coming. We’re dead inside to your rejection. Risk it all and did I mention. I’ll say it again. I’ll say it again. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. Never doubt it. Never question. What we were. And where we’ve been. Scream out loud. As our intentions. Find a word. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong. I’ll say it again. And we don’t care at all. We got nothing to take on. And leave the rest to fall. We’re going back where we belong
white knuckles,"Are you still lost tonight?. Living but dead inside. This is a proclamation. This is a call to rise. Are you abused, alone?. Walking with broken bones. If you feel you've been forgotten. Let this song guide you home. We are the disillusioned. We've been left wanting more. Before every aspiration hits the floor. Hold on for your life. All we feel is so far from alive. The damned are done believing. The cursed can dream no more. So hold on for your life. Because only the strong survive. They tell you what you should be. Sell you the plastic dream. Opinions are all provided. But nothing is what it seems. I dare you to take control. Cause empty are hands and. Bruised are the souls. Of those who show no resistance. Of those who are weak below. We are the disenchanted. Who die with each passing day. No one here understands us so I say. Hold on for your life. All we feel is so far from alive. The damned are done believing. The cursed can dream no more. So hold on for your life. Because only the strong survive. How will it feel?. To live a lie until your dying day. Where nothing is real. As we sacrifice bending until we break. It's been revealed. Hold on for your life. Dreams are not theirs to take.... Dreams are not theirs to take. Hold on for your life. All we feel is so far from alive. The damned are done believing. The cursed can dream no more. So hold on for your life. Because only the strong survive. I said only the strong survive"
wonderful life,"Yeah, eahh... eah eah eah, eah eah heah, eah eah. Close your eyes and just hear me sing. One last long goodbye. One last song before you spread your wings. There's so much left to say. Before this moment slips away. What a wonderful life. For as long as you've been at my side. And I want you to know. I loved you so. The cold night calls and the tears fall like rain. It's so hard letting go. Of the one thing I'll never replace. And soon you will be gone. But these words they will live on. Oh oh....

What a wonderful life, my friend. (Hoooh...). And all that I am you let me be. I will remember you. For all that you've done and given to me. Oh.... Love will remain, this I can see. Now and forever more. Because of you now I believe. I believe. What a wonderful life. For as long as you've been at my side. And I want you to know. I loved you so. What a wonderful life. For as long as you've been at my side. And I want you to know. I miss you so. And though our days come to an end. Know I'll never love like this again. What a wonderful life.... A wonderful life. What a wonderful life.... A wonderful life, oh (yeah...). And with one last embrace. As the tears fall like rain you're gone. And with one last goodbye. As you fade out tonight you're gone. Ohhh... oooh..."
words darker than their wings,They say you are right. I hope that I'm wrong. I know that you tried. But still it is gone. Just don't you lose hope. I swear I never dream that we're alone. Now don't you let go. I swear I still believe though I don't know. Remember the years. I still walked tall. I only fear. Now I only crawl. How could I be wrong?. I hope there comes a day your fear is gone. How could we be lost?. Lost just seize to be not carry on. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. You can love someone. Go never to ask why. Or to fear again. Go find your peace tonight. Go set out towards the sun. Let the new begin. Go soon your day will come.. Day will come. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Into the light may you fall. Into the light may you follow. Into the light may you know. Truth alone. Truth alone. Truth alone. Truth alone

Go now, surrender. You can't take no more. And just cry out. Surrender. Your faith is no more. -Solo-. What in the hell have you done?. Cast aside all that you love. The sorrows you never outrun.
