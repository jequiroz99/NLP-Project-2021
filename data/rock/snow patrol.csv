We'd set the fire to the third bar. We'd share each other like an island. Until exhausted, close our eyelids. And dreaming, pick up from. The last place we left off. Your soft skin is weeping. A joy you can't keep it. I'm miles from where you are,. I lay down on the cold ground and I. I pray that something picks me up. And sets me down in your warm arms. I'm miles from where you are,.

a youth written in fire,Remember the first time we got high. We felt like the rabid lion's roar. We were elastic and then we were healed. Healed in the blinking of an eye. And then when the dawn cracked over us. The day wouldn't hit us hard at all. We could ride the morning into night again. We knew the days were there to waste. But these days. That light hit so heavy. And those days. Feel like another life. This isn't like the first time anymore. And I've been chasing after all. Digging for the lost memories. Of our youth written in fire. You always said it's not too late for me. I sure am listening to you now. Leaving me so I can trust myself. 'Cause there's a first time for that too. Remember the first time that we kissed. It felt like a planet forming. But we were just novices at this. It felt like an ancient wisdom. There was lightning then and those. Songs were [?] true. No wonder I still think so much about you. But these days. My heart feels too heavy. And those days. Are someone else's life. This isn't like the first time anymore. And I've been chasing after all. Digging for the lost memories. Of our youth written in fire. You always said it's not too late for me. I sure am listening to you now. Leaving me so I can trust myself. 'Cause there's a first time for that too

chasing cars,"We'll do it all. Everything. On our own. We don't need. Anything. Or anyone. If I lay here. If I just lay here. Would you lie with me and just forget the world?. I don't quite know. How to say. How I feel. Those three words. Are said too much. They're not enough. If I lay here. If I just lay here. Would you lie with me and just forget the world?. Forget what we're told. Before we get too old. Show me a garden that's bursting into life. Let's waste time. Chasing cars. Around our heads. I need your grace. To remind me. To find my own. If I lay here. If I just lay here. Would you lie with me and just forget the world?. Forget what we're told. Before we get too old. Show me a garden that's bursting into life. All that I am. All that I ever was. Is here in your perfect eyes,. they're all I can see. I don't know where. Confused about how as well. Just know that these things will never change for us at all. If I lay here. If I just lay here. Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"
chocolate,This could be the very minute. I'm aware I'm alive. All these places feel like home. With a name I'd never chosen. I can make my first steps. as a child of 25. This is the straw. Final straw in the. roof of my mouth. as I lie to you. Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean. I didn't enjoy it at the time. You're the only thing that I love. It scares me more every day. On my knees I think clearer. Goodness knows I saw it coming. or at least I'll claim I did. But in truth I'm lost for words. What have I done?. It's too late for that. What have I become?. Truth is nothing yet. A simple mistake starts the hardest time. I promise I'll do anything you ask... this time
crack the shutters,You cool your bedwarm hands down. on the broken radiator. And when you lay them freezing on me. I mumble can you wake me later. But I don't really want you to stop. And you know it so it doesn't stop you. You run your hands from my neck. To my chest. Crack the shutters open wide. I want to bathe you in the light of day. And just watch you as the rays. Tangle up around your face and body. I could sit for hours. Finding new ways to be awed each minute. Cause the daylight seems to want you. Just as much as I want you. It's been minutes it's been days. It's been all I will remember. Happy lost in your hair. And the cold side of the pillow. Your hills and valleys. Are mapped by my intrepid fingers. And in a naked slumber. I dream all this again. Crack the shutters open wide. I want to bathe you in the light of day. And just watch you as the rays. Tangle up around your face and body. I could sit for hours. Finding new ways to be awed each minute. Cause the daylight seems to want you. Just as much as I want you

cubicles,"In the end. you're just as well being here. And out amongst. the frozen ponds and parks. I understand. the clarity, the solitude. But I'm beginning to think. I said too much. My words don't turn you on. You're here less than you're gone. The spark still fights the worst. Where's the hunger, where's the thirst. anymore?. I felt the fight, I felt it good. so I'm awake. It's not the dream. I hope it was the last. Your cubicles, your tentacles. will still find you. You can't hide from all the weight and wear. My words don't turn you on. You're here less than you're gone. The spark still fights the worst. Where's the hunger, where's the thirst. anymore?"
dark roman wine,"I will hang on the hook of your splendour. as the night roles us up in its arms. And the square of your thumbs and your fingers. is the blanket of sky that's so warm. I know it's late but I can't help but thinking. that the day hasn't shown all its cards. Now it's out to the stars or the ocean. Let's not retrace our steps to the car. Picking out all the stars that we like. between finger and thumb. You laugh as you pass me the night. as if it's too fragile to hold. And I hold it so close to my chest. with your hands in my hands. You say this is just how we'll rest. until the light turns to sound. Now your eyelids, they faint and they shiver. like the wings of the last bird to leave. for the south, for the heat, for no reason. It's all just to fly for sheer joy. The wind shakes the branches above us. and the car shaved the ground at our backs. But the dark roman wine in our bloodstreams. makes the cold just a word, just a sound. Picking out all the stars that we like. between finger and thumb. You laugh as you pass me the night. as if it's too fragile to hold. And I hold it so close to my chest. with your hands in my hands. You say this is just how we'll rest. until the light turns to sound. . SnowPatrolBR.com"
days without paracetamol,"When summer falls asleep. and winter plucks your strings. The colder that you get. makes you feel at home. Build it up, build it up, .... (tear it down, throw it out). If I come round there now. would you be pleased to see me?. I wouldn't make much noise. just whimper to myself. Build it up, build it up, .... (tear it down, throw it out).

disaster button,A little after twelve. The function suite was full. Of people I had never seen before. Ripped up ticket stubs. Confettied on the floor. It dawned on me I'd seen it all before. Cool your beans my son. You look a fucking mess. No one's getting out of here tonight. Hit that button there. The one that just says wrong. And we'll lose our minds to all our favourite songs. Throw forward to later. You look light on your feet. When you whirled in the room. I was nailed to my seat. I'm like a prisoner. Getting ready to talk. I feel the blood in my hands. And the threat in your walk. And suddenly. It lifts the roof off the place. It puts a vault in my step. And a grin on my face. It can't contain me. But you'll need an army. To get me back in my box. Or snap the branches off me. A little after four. The function suite is dead. And I am just a ripped up ticket stub. But here's a helping hand. A voice that's far too close. And I am up and on my broken limbs. Throw forward to later. You look light on your feet. When you whirled in the room. I was nailed to my seat. I'm like a prisoner. Getting ready to talk. I feel the blood in my hands. And the threat in your walk. And suddenly. It lifts the roof off the place. It puts a vault in my step. And a grin on my face. It can't contain me. But you'll need an army. To get me back in my box. Or snap the branches off me

Don't you dare quit so easy. Give all that you got on the soul. Don't say that you want it forever. I know, I know. Yes there's a lot we can. We can learn from this loss. Learn not to let it fall around our ears. Don't fall in love with the, with the way things were. It'll fuck up your mind, it'll fuck up your mind. For this is all on the wings of others. I loved you more. More in your own flight. So it ain't the same. It won't be lost forever. It won't be lost forever. Don't give in. Don't you dare quit so easy. Give all that you got on the soul. Don't say that you want it forever. I know, I know. Don't give in. Don't you dare quit so easy. Give all that you got on the soul. Don't say that you want it forever. I know, I know. This is your grace. And I don't know why, and I don't know why. This is your grace. And I don't know why, and I don't know why. Don't give in. Don't you dare quit so easy.

You say you love me like the endless roar of modern of life. You say you love me like the laughter and the kissed back tears. You say you love me like the past, the now, the coming years. What will you remember. what will you think of me. after I say goodbye?. Returning in bodies,. plants and the sand you'll squeeze. in between shoeless feet.

fallen empires,"You called my name in the dark. Called me back to the start. The condensation is building tension. Stubborn silence is formed. Around our bodies, it's warm. The cool wet grasses as summer passes. Frightened under attack. Fallen flat on my back. Arms and legs, I'm too scared to beg. Harm me most when it's light. Thought of you don't sit right. I need the darkness, a desperate embrace. Razing cities to dust. Faces dripping in lust. Fallen empires and raging bushfires. All your words unfounded. Secret lives bound in bed. Living backwards and tangled back words. Ruined everything right. So good can't see the light. From my cave I can see the wave. Fallen empires and raging bushfires. Ooooh.... We are the, we are the light. We are the light [repetir]. (Run to the fire)"

gleaming auction,I'll get tired of the heart attacks. Every time it rings. I'll put myself on the waiting list. And get it all cleared up. You're the one with the attitude. Don't try and make me out. To be the root of the evil in. The whole rotten affair. Lie back and suffer now. We've both earned our reward. Buried deep in the telegram. I'm sure I never got. Was any clue of the whereabouts. Of all the things I'd lost. Just because you were right before. Doesn't mean you're right. To make up now would just vindicate. Every doubt I had. It's not as simple as. How much you think you care.

Are you wolf or are you lamb?. Are you too scared to choose?. I'm ready for the answers, I'm ready for the drop. I'm ready to be shocking, I'm ready to be shocked. Your cold hands feel good on me. and my scorched heart cools fast. The stranger taught me all I know. of the world and other thirst. The alleyways and darkest lanes. of my tired mind form a star. Frightening stone of dark red heat. that burns through my whole body. I'm ready for the answers, I'm ready for the drop. I'm ready to be shocking, I'm ready to be shocked. . SnowPatrolBrasil.com"
if i'd found the right words to say,"Right about now, if I'd found the right words to say. I'd tell you you're safe and take hold of your hand. I'll be there by your side for the rest of your life. Our bodies could fall off the end of the world. Something told me we'd be happy forever. I don't see how this could change any of that. I will follow your ghost as it climbs up the rock-face. And lie with you on the grass above. And I'd like to change all this. And I'd like to wake up from this. By your side. How did we ever survive for this length of time?. Living with only a care for one thing. But the light that shines from her whenever she's happy. Is worth every minute that we've saved ourselves. Maybe there's hope in just one final second. A flash of her love as she waves us goodbye. Don't torture yourself with what we might have given. We did everything that we could ever do. And I'd like to change all this. And I'd like to wake up from this. By your side"
if there’s a rocket tie me to it,"Two weeks later like a surplus reprieve. I found a hair the length of yours on my sleeve. I wound it round and round my finger so tight. It turned to purple and a pulse formed inside. And I knew the beat 'cause it matched your own beat. I still remember it from our chest to chest and feet to feet. The easy silence then was a sweet relief to this hush. Of ovens, aeroplanes and of distant car horns. A fire, a fire, you can only take what you can carry. A pulse your pulse, it's the only thing I can remember. I break you don't, I was always set to self destruct though. The fire, the fire, it cracks and barks like primal music. I said I knew the beat 'cause it matched your own beat. It's become my engine my own source of heat. The sea between us only amplifies the sound waves. Every hum and echo and crash paints my cave. A fire, a fire, you can only take what you can carry. A pulse your pulse, it's the only thing I can remember. I break you don't, I was always set to self destruct though. The fire the fire, it cracks and barks like primal. music. A fire a fire, you can only take what you can carry. A pulse your pulse, it's the only thing I can remember.

in a dream i saw satellites,"In a dream I saw satellites. Falling from the darkening sky. As they made their way down to me. They get smaller and smaller. Until they were the size of birds and bees. And they're swarm me left and right. In the maddening noise trapped hurricane. I was drunk with panicked joy. I know somewhere in here. Is all that I've learned. But it makes as much sense as it ever did. And what connects us all to a wakened world. Is the voice that penetrates. The storm to guide us home. In a dream I saw you again. You were reflected all around. Doors and windows, lakes and swimming pools. Even in the sky above. Doors and windows turning to water. And I was hauled off in the wake. Though I heard you call my name somewhere. Before the ocean swallowed me. I know somewhere in here. Is all that I've learned. But it makes as much sense as it ever did. And what connects us all to a wakened world. Is the voice that penetrates. The storm to guide us home. I know somewhere in here. Is all that I've learned. But it makes as much sense as it ever did. And what connects us all to a wakened world. Is the voice that penetrates. The storm to guide us home"
in command of cars,It was the bridge she flung herself off. I used to see her standing on one side. As if too frightened to walk across. And sometimes stand still and drive some invisible car. Toes on the edge of the pavement. To steer her clear of the car. That hit her on the way down. Rubbing asphalt in her wounds. A love that won't die only tortures. Nothing else no comfort no future. Brakes a fair-few up. If there is a god someone wake him up. And tell him to sort it out. Tell him to sort it out. Command of cars you drive. He sits and stares at the road. White lines blur into black. Until he sees nothing else. He tried to cope with her loss. By forgetting who he was. But he'd never forget her face. I saw him make the first move. To follow her all the way down. the wire for the last time. He dreamt he'd taken a dive. And caught her on the way down. And now he can sleep at night. He still has a lock of her hair. He gave her a lock of his own. He clenches it tight in his hand. Command of cars you drive

in the end,"It's the price I guess. For the lies I've told. That the truth it no longer thrills me. And why can't we laugh?. When it's all we have. Have we put these childish things away?. Have we lost the magic that we once had?. In the end, in the end. There's nothing more to life than love, is there?. In the end, in the end. It's time for us to lose our weary minds.

isolation (john lennon cover),"People say we got it made. Don't they know we're so afraid?. Isolation. We're afraid to be alone. Everybody got to have a home. Isolation. Just a boy and a little girl. Trying to change the whole wide world. Isolation. The world is just a little town. Everybody trying to put us down. Isolation. I don't expect you to understand. After you've caused so much pain. But then again, you're not to blame. You're just a human, a victim of the insane. We're afraid of everyone. Afraid of the sun. Isolation. The sun will never disappear. But the world may not have many years. Isolation"
"it doesn't matter where, just drive",You are far too fragile to exist. I didn't see the hand I'd never kiss. And I barely felt your heartbeat inside of me. The empty patter of your feet is too fast to see. The families all gather round. And they make some sympathetic sounds. Even though I know they're only trying to take my mind off it. I just wanna sit alone and cry myself into a fit. And fall asleep. I would have loved to watch you as you slept. I fill the frames of pictures that I kept. Of you leaping into action on some muddy football. field. Or holding the attraction of the one that makes you. feel so sick. And I choose to see the life I live. It's one of triumph and of joy that gives. Made of something to hold onto as I'm falling through myself. To the part of me that held you on the darkest shelf. inside me
it's beginning to get to me,I want something. That's purer than the water. Like we were. It's not there now. Ineloquence and anger. Are all we have. Like Saturn's rings. An icy loop around me. Too hard to hold. Lash out first. At all the things we don't like. Or understand. And it's beginning to get to me. That I know more of the stars and sea. Than I do of what's in your head. Barely touching in our cold bed. Are you beginning to get get my point. They're always fighting with aching joints. It's doing nothing but tire us out. No one knows what this fight's about. The answer phone. The lonely sound of your voice. Frozen in time. I only need. The compass that you gave me. To guide me on. And it's beginning to get to me. That I know more of the stars and sea. Than I do of what's in your head. Barely touching in our cold bed. Are you beginning to get get my point. They're always fighting with aching joints. It's doing nothing but tire us out. No one knows what this fight's about. It's so thrilling but also wrong. Don't have to prove that you are so strong. Cos I can carry you on my back. After our enemies attack. I tried to tell you before I left. But I was screaming under my breath. You are the only thing that makes sense. Just ignore all this present tense. We need to feel breathless with love. And not collapse under its weight. I'm gasping for the air to fill. My lungs with everything I've lost. We need to feel breathless with love. And not collapse under its weight.

please just take these photos from my hands,"The yellowed page of the books and books I'd forgotten that I had. These paperbacks they know their age they smell of weight and time that's resting warm. The opened box beside the endless box parade that haunts my house. Is fit to split with photographs that tell the wanderlust of years smashed on to years. When all this actual life played out. Where the hell on Earth was I?. I rack my brains but it won't come. Through water damaged bloodshot eyes. The fleeting triumphs, brazen lies. All seem to mingle into one. I read your name under words in your elegant hand you probably don't mean now. I fold the letter and think of a million and one things that I could have done different. When all this actual life played out. Where the hell on Earth was I?. I rack my brains but it won't come. Through water damaged bloodshot eyes. The fleeting triumphs, brazen lies. All seem to mingle into one. One gigantic fairy tale. Of friends I haven't seen in years. Drinking 'til the daylight hurts. You seem friendly who are you?. That's a lot of wine that we got through. We've made playtime look like work.. Please just take these photos from my hands"

raze the city,Here I come. Through the west wing of your house. Slay the butler by the door. Plan my attack for weeks and weeks. Some mad thinking going on here. Grab your smile and from the bed. as we head down to the town. Here we come. Through the city streets at night. Causing mayhem as we go. Never letting go of hands. Your eyes burnt and nothing stopped. Steal a car and drive away. Your eyes never even burn so. Wanna stay with you. Wanna stay with you. Wanna stay with you. Wanna stay with you
reading heaney to me,The night tumbles on us. with gentle pause. The cars and the chaos. a muted purr. The couch and the kettle. are call to arms. your arms to be exact. they bring me home. I'll sit still. I'll hold my tongue. Just use your voice. and Heaney's words. Dig your way through to my heart. plant your flag and set up camp. I've shut my eyes. I've closed the blinds. Turn the phones and nightlights off. Just you and me and naturalists. held with tender hands and mouth. The storm's on the island. are just whispers now. I melt with the warm words. and your coffee tones. The dark twisted creatures. can't find us here. Your hand on my forehead. is the softest vice. I'll sit still. I'll hold my tongue. Just use your voice. and Heaney's words. Dig your way through to my heart. plant your flag and set up camp. I've shut my eyes. I've closed the blinds. Turn the phones and nightlights off.

Louder, louder. and we'll run for our lives. I can hardly speak I understand. why you can't raise your voice to say.

set down your glass,Just close your eyes. And count to five. Let's craft the only thing we know into surprise. Set down your glass. I painted this. To look like you and me forever as we're now. And I'm shaking then I'm still. When your eyes meet mine. I lose simple skills. Like to tell you all I want is now. Your saved and I'm killed. I'm just not the same. As I was a year ago and each minute since then. My jumper tears. As we take it off. You say you'll sew me good as new and I know you will. And I'm shaking then I'm still. When your eyes meet mine. I lose simple skills. Like to tell you all I want is now. And I'm shaking then I'm still. When your eyes meet mine. I lose simple skills. Like to tell you all I want is now
set the fire to the third bar (feat. martha wainwright),"I find the map and draw a straight line. Over rivers, farms, and state lines. The distance from me to where you'd be. It's only finger-lengths that I see. I touch the place where I'd find your face. My finger in creases of distant dark places. I hang my coat up in the first bar. There is no peace that I've felt so far. The laughter penetrates my silence. As drunken men find flaws in science. Their words mostly noises. Ghosts with just voices. Your words in my memory. Are like music to me. I'm miles from where you are,. I lay down on the cold ground and I. I pray that something picks me up. And sets me down in your warm arms. After I have travelled so far. We'd set the fire to the third bar. We'd share each other like an island. Until exhausted, close our eyelids. And dreaming, pick up from. The last place we left off. Your soft skin is weeping. A joy you can't keep it. I'm miles from where you are,. I lay down on the cold ground and I. I pray that something picks me up. And sets me down in your warm arms. I'm miles from where you are,. I lay down on the cold ground and I. I pray that something picks me up. And sets me down in your warm arms"
shut your eyes,"Shut your eyes and think of somewhere. Somewhere cold and caked in snow. By the fire we break the quiet. Learn to wear each other well. And when the worrying starts to hurt. and the world feels like graves of dirt. Just close your eyes until. you can imagine this place. You're our secret space at will. Shut your eyes, I spin the big chair. And you'll feel dizzy, light and free. And falling gently on the cushion. You can come and sing to me. And when the worrying starts to hurt. and the world feels like graves of dirt. Just close your eyes until. you can imagine this place. You're our secret space at will. Shut your eyes [x4]. Shut your eyes and sing to me (Shut your eyes and sing to me) [x4]"
signal fire,"The perfect words never crossed my mind. Cause there was nothing in there but you. I felt every ounce of me, screaming out. But the sound was trapped deep in me. All I wanted, just sped right past me. But I was rooted fast to the earth. I could be stuck here for a thousand years. Without your arms to drag me out. There you are, standing right in front of me. There you are, standing right in front of me. All this fear falls away, you leave me naked. Hold me close,. cause I need you to guide me to safety. No, I won't wait forever. No, I won't wait forever. In the confusion, and the aftermath. You are my signal fire. The only resolution and the only joy. Is the faint spark of forgiveness in your eyes. There you are, standing right in front of me. There you are, standing right in front of me. All this fear falls away, you leave me naked. Hold me close,. cause I need you to guide me to safety. There you are, standing right in front of me. There you are, standing right in front of me. All this fear falls away, you leave me naked. Hold me close,. cause I need you to guide me to safety. No, I won't wait forever. No, I won't wait forever.

somewhere a clock is ticking,"I've got this feeling that there's something that I missed. (I could do almost anything to you...). Don't you breathe [2x]. Something happened, that I never understood. You can't leave[2x]. Every second, dripping off my fingertips. Wage your war [2x]. Another soldier, says he's not afraid to die. I'm so scared [2x]. In slow motion, the blast is beautiful. Doors slam shut [2x]. A clock is ticking, but it's hidden far away. Safe and sound[2x]"
soon,"Soon you'll not remember anything. But then someday neither will I. Tomorrow though is nothing to fear. Because father it's all wasted here. Life won't flash before your eyes. Instead we'll fall away then melt like snow. The secret storms of your wild youth. Now just gentle breezes, warm and faint. Soon you'll not remember anything. But then some day neither will I. Tomorrow though has nothing to fear. Because father it's all wasted here. I can't ride on your cold tails again. Like I always did as a little boy. We are sand in all the old shores now. My whole hand hanging onto your thumb. There's a place in the palace of you. We can always be standing like that. We could hide in there, just as we were then. You're just my father and I am just your son. Your son. Your son. Your son"
spitting games,I broke into your house last night. And left a note at your bedside. I'm far too shy to speak to you at school. You leave me numb and I'm not sure why. I find it easier to sit and stare. Than push my limbs out towards you right there. My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes. As blue as oceans and as pure as skies. I struggle for the words and then give up. My heads up with the birds on the t-hut. A little piece of mind that I know better. That the plain disgrace of all my letters. But after that the floodgates opened up. And I fell in love with everyone I saw. Please take your time I'm not in any rush. And it's in everything I ever write. It's not as if I need the extra weight. Confused enough by life so thanks a lot. Lonely written words for company. Just raise the roof this once and follow me

sticky teenage twin,"To run about with no style chasing her around Dundee. Making sense about as much as nonsense is meant to make sense. Sleeping in cause I'm mortified to go outside today. All this time and I have changed so much but sometimes never. Keep in time. All my love I am leaving here because I cannot cope with your man touching you and patronizing me. What's his game?. I don't give a toss about what he has to say for himself or anyone for that matter. Keep in time. All this time I'm thinking if I could make you love me. I'd be better this time, swear to God"
t.m.t,"Cover my in anything you'd have on me. Curl my teeth with bitter smiles and cigarettes. Torture me and let me watch you as you fuck him. Bury me in love until i suffocate. 'Cause it's easier to make love. Than to crawl across the floor and beg for more. After all, this cold i'm sure won't last for long. The bible thumpers on each corner turn to drink. They only do it to avoid the freezing cold. Their mother chase them out of bars. And down the street. 'Cause it's easier to hide from. Than it is to face reality each day"

the afterlife,"Throw the phone hard at the wall. And at once my muscles stall. Slowly my mind cools and calms. Decompressed and disengaged. I put my pen to virgin page. With each scratch I'm hauled away. Through the slowest country dance. To not knowing in advance. Every impending detail. So exploding with the news. Cages rattled, looks confused. Seems I might have gone too far. My front door lies in splinters. And barefoot in the winter. My prayers are unsuccessful. To a god that I can recall. I could learn. I could learn. I could learn to keep my mouth shut. I might learn. I might learn. I might learn to keep my mouth shut. There's a pause before the howl. And I'm well past feral now. Liberated and joyous. Curtains open, necks are craned. Shady heads in burnt wood frames. Then the rumble from within. The insanity is catching. As out of doors like hatchlings. The people leave their houses. In barely more than blouses. This is fun. This is fun. It's the most fun I remember.. This is fun. This is fun. It's the most fun I remember.. (It's the fight. It's the fight. It's the fight that we are winning) x4"

the finish line,"The Finish Line. The earth is warm next to my ear. Insects noise is all that I hear. A magic trick makes the world disappear. The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear. A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy. The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb. It's like the finish line where everything just ends. The crack of radios seems close enough to touch. Cold water, cleaning my wounds. A side parade, with a single balloon. I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten. Blue as seas, running to them. I feel like I am watching everything from space. And in a minute I hear my name and I wake. I think the finish line's a good place we could start. Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want"

Oh, you will never know how much I love you. You would call the garden rules, out like commands. And we would all obey. But you'd stifle giddy laughter as you spoke. And puncture the pretend. And we would chase our tails. Until the sun forgot to shine. And our parents called our names. Till just you and I were left. Oh, you will never know how much I love you so. Oh, you will never know how much I love you. From your house we walk the river. To the church by the silent fields. Amongst the lavender and headstones. And the larks in our Sunday clothes.

Nor the thunder in the footsteps. 'Cause fear and anger. They are law unto themselves. And you love the little signs of life. You love it when we lose our minds. You love these little wars of words. You love it when they call your name. It's the weight of love in your arms. It's the weight of love in your arms. It's the weight of love so gentle in your arms. [x2]. It's just like you told me. I should learn to let it all go. It just took 'til now. For me to get just what you meant. My heart is thumping. I can feel it in my fingers. No fear, no anger. We are law unto ourselves. It's the weight of love in your arms. It's the weight of love in your arms. It's the weight of love so gentle in your arms. [3x]"
this isn't everything you are,"You can't find the phone so you can call it off. But it might be for the best. You can't walk away, anyway. Cause you've nowhere else to go. Is he worth all this, is it a simple yes?. 'Cause if you have to think it's fucked. It feels like you loved him more than he loved you. And you wish you'd never met. Don't keel over now. Don't keel over. Don't keel over now. Don't keel over. You've been up all night, and the night before. You've lost count of drinks and time. And your friends keep calling, worried sick. There's strangers everywhere. Don't keel over now. Don't keel over. Don't keel over now. Don't keel over. And in one little moment it all implodes. This isn't everything you are. Breathe deeply in the silence, no sudden moves. This isn't everything you are. Just take the hand that's offered and hold on tight. This isn't everything you are. There's joy not far from here, right, I know there is. This isn't everything you are. When you took the call, how could you know. That he'd slipped away last night?. And you wish you went home days ago. To say goodbye or just hello. Don't keel over now. Don't keel over. Don't keel over now. Don't keel over. And in one little moment it all implodes. This isn't everything you are. Breathe deeply in the silence, no sudden moves. This isn't everything you are. Just take the hand that's offered and hold on tight. This isn't everything you are. There's joy not far from here, right, I know there is. This isn't everything you are. This isn't everything you are. This isn't everything you are"
those distant bells,The car crunches gravel. And the wind looks at you. This dark spell you're under. As you're dumbstruck by the gates. It hurts every muscle. Just to walk back to the house. Now this home that you both lived. It looks haunted from the yard. You can hear those distant bells. And you know they'll never leave. It's like your church is crying out. Like the wolf calls to the young. The dark never enters. But it also never leaves. And the spark that he gave you. Is just an ember all but out. If he'd weren't out on the exit. Oh you never would've known. Until he drove off in the darkness. Like some slowly fading song. You can hear those distant bells. And you know they'll never leave. It's like your church is crying out. Like the wolf calls to the young. You can hear those distant bells. And you know they'll never leave. It's like your church is crying out. Like the wolf calls to the young
tiny little fractures,"Is there a place I can go. Is there a light to get me there. If I've forgotten what to say. It's because all words are dust. If this is really what you think. How come you won't look me in the eye. All this crying in your sleep. As I lie awake beside. Is there a T-shirt I can wear. Coz I am soaking look at me. What do you mean I don't love you. I am standing here, aren't I. Maybe you thought of it first. Maybe I get all the praise. Is there a place I can go. Is there a light to get me there"
tired,I'm tired of lying. It breaks my heart. Just want to be with. You everyday. Not used to people. Thinking I'm doing. Something I shouldn't. When all I want. I've no where left to hide myself. Without you here to cover my eyes. With your sweet lips. If there's someway else of doing this. I cannot think of any other path to wind down. I'm tired of lying. It breaks my heart. Just want to be with. You everyday. Not used to people. Thinking I'm doing. Something I shouldn't. When all I want. Don't panic. I was always here. I wouldn't last a minute. Without you beside me.

ways and means,Getting too busy to make amends. I should try to make it right. Are you ready for the shit to hit. I think you say you are but aren't. Doctor make it better instantly. You're the only one who can. I've waited here my whole damn life. And I've forgotten what I wanted. Maybe I can do it. If I put my back into it. I can leave you if I wanted. But there's nowhere else that I can go. Maybe I won't suffer. If I find a way to love here. I'd be lying to myself. But there is no way out that I can see. If I lied you'd know it instantly. So I just had to look away. All the honesty I've ever lost. I can't begin to even curse. I never knew the taste of blood till now. It's clear I never should have known. Breathing fire was never this much fun. So there's a dark side in us all
we can run away now they're all dead and gone,One step too far. Is not far enough away from here. Stay close to me. Don’t relax your grip on my right hand. But you are all I really want in this life. You could be the summer rain on my face. You push a little tear into my eye lid. Don’t torture yourself thinking that it must sting. Don’t turn your head. Pretend they’re all dead and gone by now. Can you feel that?. Feels like breath on the back of my neck. But you are all I really want in this life. You could be the summer rain on my face. You push a little tear into my eye lid. Don’t torture yourself thinking that it must sting. . by delluchi
what if the storms ends,"What if the storm ends and I don't see you. As you are now ever again?. The perfect halo of gold hair and lightning. Sets you off against the planet's last dance. Just for a minute the silver-forked sky. Lifts you up like a star that I will follow. But now it's found us like I have a found you. I don't wanna run, just overwhelm me. What if the storm ends? At least that's nothing. Except the memory, a distant echo I won't pin down. I've walked unsettled rattle cage after cage. Until my blood boils. I wanna see you as you are now. Every single day that I am living. Painted in flames, a peeling thunder. Be the lightning in me that strikes relentless. What if the storm ends and I don't see you. As you are now ever again?. The perfect halo of gold hair and lightning. Sets you off against the planet's last dance. Just for a minute the silver-forked sky. Lifts you up like a star that I will follow. But now it's found us like I have a found you. I don't wanna run, just overwhelm me"
what if this is all the love you ever get?,"Woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?. Woah, you'd do a couple things so differently, I bet. Woah, what if this is all the love I ever know. Woah, I'd say the words that were so hard to say: don't go. So you've fallen in love. So you've fallen apart. What if it hurts like hell. Then it'll hurt like hell. Come on over, come on over here.

whatever's left,"It's a feeling I've had many times before. I can't hold the fort so don't give me more. I struggle and sweat when I'm wide awake. When I know I'm fine, I'm not used to fine. It's the same thing again. But it could become a problem if. We don't deal with it now. And you blast off in another rant. I've not opened my mouth. Can you read my mind so easily. As the madness sets in. You must know that I'll follow you. A sudden movement and a broken limb. The patches are there to show where I'm hit. My fault is it now well that's news to me. Curled and joyless we try once again"

We could spend the day together. The first time in a long, long while. You can wrap me up in tinsel. Make as much noise as you like. When I said that I loved her instead. It's funny how you misunderstand. I only wanna hold her hand. You're so far from me all year long. I can't seem to right my--right my wrong. When we get home for Christmas.

when it's all over we still have to clear up,You're not fair. Telling me. You faked every orgasm. You've had with me. That's just fine. Now it's over. And I'm out here. Banging my head. After all the dancing. And spilling beer all over the place. I lie out here. In disgrace. You've had your fun. Kissed some bloke you shouldn't have. Right in front of me. Punched him to the floor. I could have killed him there. But I got thrown out. I'll get him some other time. When he least expects it. . By Personal Holloway
when love breaks down,"My love and I, we work well together. But often we're apart. Absence makes the heart lose weight, yeah. Till love breaks down, love breaks down. Oh my, oh my, have you seen the weather. The sweet September rain. Rain on me like no other. Until I drown, until I drown. When love breaks down. The things you do. To stop the truth from hurting you. When love breaks down. The lies we tell. They only serve to fool ourselves. When love breaks down. The things you do. To stop the truth from hurting you.

I should have stopped you from walking out the door. You could be happy, I hope you are. You made me happier than I'd been by far. Somehow everything I own smells of you. And for the tiniest moment it's all not true. Do the things that you always wanted to. Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do. More than anything I want to see you, girl. Take a glorious bite out of the whole world"
