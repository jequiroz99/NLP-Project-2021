in my life,There are places i remember. All my life though some have changed. Some forever not for better. Some have gone and some remain. All these places have their moments. With lovers and friends i still can recall. Some are dead and some are living. In my life i've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers. There is no one compares with you. And these memories lose thier meaning. When i think of love as something new. Though i know i'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know i'll often stop and think about them. In my life i love you more. Though i know i'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know i'll often stop and think about them. In my life i love you more. In my life i love you more...

it's only rock'n'roll,"If I could stick my pen in my heart. I would spill it all over the stage. Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya. Would you think the boy is strange? Ain't he strange?.

lucy in the sky with diamonds,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river. With tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly. A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green. Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes. And she's gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain. Where rocking horse people. eat marshmallow pies. Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers. That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore. Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds. And you're gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Picture yourself on a train in a station. With plasticine porters with looking glass ties. Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile. The girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Lucy in the sky with diamonds..."
over the rainbow,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high. There's a land that I dreamed of. Once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream. Really do come true. Someday I'll wish upon a star. And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops. High above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me, oh. Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh, why can't I?"

the fool on the hill,"Day after day alone on the hill,. The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,. But nobody wants to know him,. They can see that he’s just a fool,. And he never gives an answer,. But the fool on the hill. Sees the sun going down,. And the eyes in his head,. See the world spinning around. . Well on his way his head in a cloud,. The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud. But nobody ever hears him,. Or the sound he appears to make,. And he never seems to notice,. But the fool on the hill . .. . Nobody seems to like him. They can tell what he wants to do. And he never shows his feelings,. But the fool on the hill . ."
