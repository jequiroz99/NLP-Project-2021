Real love forever. Real love. Born of the fallen chain. Into a world sustained with sorrow. Real love. A real touch we speak in. Is it lies.. Or is what we're seeking. Real love. In the eyes. Behold and you'll find the 21st century. Detonate her will and her widowed speech. Buried in the backyard shadow. The rusty shadow tin. That held her mother's first kiss in a. Nameless dream. Fall down the stairs again. To feel alive again, it's tommorow. Real love. Or is it me you're after. Is it time. Cause it's now or never. Real love. Real love forever. Is it love. Or just yours to treasure. Real love. Real love. Real love. We never listen. Real love will listen. And tell of a fortune. Real love is riches. Scratch through the changes. Real love is nameless. So tired and hopeless. Real love is painless. Nobody mentions. We ever move to collect. The solar questions. Demon scorn should not relax. The laws of gravity. Real Love. ."

age of innocence,We dismiss the back roads. To ride these streets unafraid. Resigned to scraping paint. From our bones unashamed. No more the eye upon you. No more the simple man. Desolation yes hesitation no. Desolation yes hesitation no. As you might have guessed all is never shown. Desolation yes hesitation no. And in my prayers I dream alone. A silent speech to deaf ear. If you want love you must be love. But if you bleed love you will die loved. No more the lie upon you. Cast into stone and autumn shade. Desolation yes hesitation no. Desolation yes hesitation no. As you might have sensed we won't make it home. Desolation yes hesitation no. Before the rites of spring - Come to mean all things. A little taste of what may come - A mere glimpse of what has gone. Cause for the moment we are free - We seek to bind our release. Too young to die too rich to care too fucked to swear that I was there. Desolation yes hesitation no. Desolation yes hesitation no. As you might have guessed we won't make it home. Desolation yes hesitation no. .

It's about time. It's about here. Blue skies bring tears. Shake loose the huddled masses. Steal the urgent love. Crept to the faded hoses. Broken sea shell part. Fire all your dead, she's older. Shoot down the skeletal man. None of it leads to crisis. And then don't even go through hell. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears. Blue skies bring tears."

DNA is reaching out. To your frequency. I want to live. Don't want to die. I want to live. I want to try. All in prayer. Prayer in all. All are scared. Scared of all. Black rooms are calling. To men in leather coats. White labs are cooking up the silver ghost. The glass migrates under her translucent skin. And all the spiders wonder what we've got us in. All is you. You are all. All with you. You in all. I want to live. I don't want to die. I want to live. I want to try. So beats the final coda. Of a vintl storm. One more cherry cola to lift up her dead arms. A dream of sot focus sunsets filters thru the din. We are losing contact as she dials it in. She can hear glass calling. Or is it someone that looks like him. She eyes tv reflection and nods a knowing look. She says it doesn't matter. She never liked her looks. I have seen a thousand fractures. I have seen everything. Cause knowing is it's own answer. Love something in a book. There's not much left to ponder. Not much left to cook. As she counted the spiders. As they crawled up inside her. As she counted the spiders. As they crawled up inside her.

real love,"Written by Billy Corgan. Fall in to the century of supersonic cross. Blessed she in aching silence- eternal loss. Calling out ""I won't surrender"". A locket of her hair. Sympathize her pious pleasures. Go down the stairs into the dark again. To feel alive again, and wait for. Real love. Or is it me you're after. Is it time?. Because it's now or never. Real love. Real love forever. Real love. Born of the fallen chain. Into a world sustained with sorrow. Real love. A real touch we speak in. Is it lies.. Or is what we're seeking. Real love. In the eyes. Behold and you'll find the 21st century. Detonate her will and her widowed speech. Buried in the backyard shadow. The rusty shadow tin. That held her mother's first kiss in a. Nameless dream. Fall down the stairs again. To feel alive again, it's tommorow. Real love. Or is it me you're after. Is it time. Cause it's now or never. Real love. Real love forever. Is it love. Or just yours to treasure. Real love. Real love. Real love. We never listen. Real love will listen. And tell of a fortune. Real love is riches. Scratch through the changes. Real love is nameless. So tired and hopeless. Real love is painless. Nobody mentions. We ever move to collect. The solar questions. Demon scorn should not relax. The laws of gravity. Real Love. ."

I drive the dirt of her garden. Sorrow. She'll never listen again. No other lovers to bend. Just rotten apples to eat. Just letter yellowed distant scorn. Dirty your face. With longing and grace, God-given. Suffer her heart. And love her when your love goes unrequited. Life just fades away. Purity just begs. Dust to dust, we're wired into sadness."

Why? Confusion haunts me still. My will can't reign. Lost I go into your hiding room. You'll be lost to me. Walking in the sun. I'll never feel the light. Walking in the sun. I'll know that I never feel. Walking in the sun. I never feel the light. Walking in my sun. I know that I never feel.

And all you took from me is lost. Black wings carry me so high. Up to meet you in the sky. I'm disconnected by your smile. Disconnect a million miles. And what you promised me. I hope will set you free. I'm disconnected by your smile. Wishing you were real to me. Wishing I could make believe. I'll take my secrets to the grave. Safely held beneath the waves. Always knew I couldn't save. Always knew I couldn't save you. And in my heart I know you're there. And in my heart I know you're here. And in my heart I know you're gone"

We can never have enough. You know I'm not dead. You know, You know I'm not dead. You know I'm not dead. Down below. The creatures scream. Stranglehold. A god machine. Begging to. Tear us out. Worn as hope. You know I'm not dead. I'm just the tears inside your head. Forever waiting. On the ways of your desire. You always find a way. And thru it all into us all you move. Forgotten touch.

It's alright. Are you with us, tonight?. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. Are you with us, tonight?. Soon we'll fly. But on this eve we ride. A steel horse tied to dirt. The words, the words, the words. No words will suffice. Against the sacrifice. For what is love, if not cause. My misdeeds will scurry home. Dust & breath & bone. Are you with us, or against us?. Are you with us, or against us?. Are you with us, are you with us?. Are you with us, or against us, tonight?. It's a matter of 'us' & 'them' this fight. It's alright. Are you with us, tonight?.

Still locked in your heart. Everywhere you are. Everywhere you are. Every single chard. Everywhere you are. You're never too far. Cause anywhere you'd go. Even to the stars. All you have to do. Is play the part of who you are. The rest is up to you. Phase unwound. By yourself. Atom bomb. On the shelf unsung. Pause of light. Pulse of life. New face dawns. Everywhere you are. And everywhere you go. Even if you're down. Even if you're low. It's in the thought of you. It's in the eyes of all. Astride a storied past. That's everywhere you are. Your love must always be true. Your love must always be you. Everywhere you are. Anywhere you go. Even if you're scarred. It's all a part of you. But ever should you put it down. You can never lose me. Everywhere you are.
the last song,This is the last song. This is the last song I'll sing for you. This is the last song. This is the last song I can give you. The roaring city sleeps. Metal fingers clutching dirty sheets. And no one comes for free. In this place where the angels sleep. This is the last song. This is the last song. My eyes are open wonder to this. As you hold the secrets. I count the minutes off so perfectly. The shards of broken glass. Sing the strains of a sad old tune. We've made it at last. But what we had is lost inside our past. This is the last song. This is the last song. Could you find away across me. To forgive and forget me. To appease and relent me. To deceive and detect me. To understand and release me. To the dawn.

thirty-three,"Speak to me in a language I can hear. Humour me before I have to go. Deep in thought I forgive everyone. As the cluttered streets greet me once again. I know I can't be late, supper's waiting on the table. Tomorrow's just an excuse away. So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own. The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet. At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk. Steeple guide me to my heart and home. The sun is out and up and down again. I know i'll make it, love can last forever. Graceful swans of never topple to the earth. And you can make it last, forever you. You can make it last, forever you. And for a moment I lose myself. Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world. I've journeyed here and there and back again. But in the same old haunts I still find my friends. Mysteries not ready to reveal. Sympathies I'm ready to return. I'll make the effort, love can last forever. Graceful swans of never topple to the earth. Tomorrow's just an excuse. And you can make it last, forever you. You can make it last, forever you"

Crashing down my freinds. I've got to move it on. I've got to sing my song. While I still can. Dispatch the last alarms. Hand out the last few charms. There's no surprises. Only love. Only love can win. Crashing down. Crashing down again. Only love. Yeah only love will win. Crashing down. Crashing down again. This time I need to know. I really must be told. That it's over. I've lived my life alone. My every step foretold. To never linger. And yet it haunts me so. What are we letting go. Our spell is broken. Crashing down. Crashing down my friends. Crashing down. Crashing down again. Only love. Yeah only love will. Be enough. Yeah only love will win. For every chemical. You trade a piece of your soul. With no return. And who you think you know. Doesn't know you at all. Their drain is needless. Someday we'll wave hello. And wish we'd never waved goodbye. To this romance. We'll drink up every line. And shoot up every word. Till there's no more. Crashing down. Crashing down my friends. Only love. Only love can win. So cry these tears we'll cry as all. We've held so long to fall apart. As the curtain falls we bid you all goodnight.
thru the eyes of a ruby,"Wrap me up in always,. And drag me in with maybes. Your innocence is treasure,. Your innocence is death. Your innocence is all I have. Breathing underwater,.

And I said, I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give. You up. From one another, another one should come to one another. No one should come between us. Still I was lonely, and she was by my side, my one and only. Knows that she could never hide. I couldn't feel her, and it was just a game,. Cause I was lonely and she was crazy. Rat-tat-tat, ka boom boom, now take that, and just a bit of this. Cause I'm a watcher, and I'm a doer of none. Come to save you, cause you're all mine. I hurt where I can't feel, I feel where I can't hurt. I know where I can't know, I bleed for me and mine. Ka-boom, a rat-tat-tat, and some good ole bliss. Cause I'm a sister, and I'm a motherfuck. I am made of shamrocks, I am made of stern stuff. I am never enough, I am the forgotten child. And I said I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give. You up. From one another, no one should ever come. In between us, between us and our love. Mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow. And everywhere that mary went I was sure to go. Now mary's got a problem, and mary's not a stupid girl. Mary's got some deep shit, and mary does not forget. And this is how mary's garden grows, and this is how mary has. Her ghosts. And into the eyes of the jackyl I say ka-boom. Now we begin descent, to where we've never been. There is no going back, this wasn't meant to last. This is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve. And she will never learn [she will never learn]. Bye bye, baby goodbye [bye bye]. *afs"
you're all i've got tonight,"I don't care if you hurt me some more. I don't care if you even the score. You can knock me, I don't care. You can mock me, I don't care. You can rock me just about anywhere. It's alright 'cus you're all I've got tonight. You're all I've got tonight. You're all I've got tonight. I need you tonight. I don't care if you use me again. I don't care if you abuse me again. You can make me, I don't care. You can bump me, I don't care. You can love me just about anywhere. It's alright"
zeitgeist,flung wide. the salutations. the deep curse. and the shutters close. a spring house. in the making. on good earth. of my many'd souls in my soul. and fears I don't know. I hear there's a march we should go. lost on this road. are there any real Sundays to find?. unbound. on the rising. the pell mell. of the miser kings. as you saw what I'm seeing. oh you'd thaw from the fires. there's pace in your gait. and wake in your straights. I ache from the center out. lost on this road are there any real Sundays to find?. lost on this road are there any real souls?. don't hear what I hear. don't see what I see. don't leave what I must leave behind. lost on this road are there any real Sundays to find?. this stop. I am hunger. the deep well. of a stranger held. and this heart a lonely hunter now. I'm lost on this road are there any real Sundays to find?. I'm lost on this road. are there any real souls?. are there any real souls to find?. are there any real souls to find?
zero,"My reflection, dirty mirror. There's no connection to myself. I'm your lover, I'm your zero. I'm the face in your dreams of glass. So save your prayers. For when we're really gonna need 'em. Throw out your cares and fly. Wanna go for a ride?. She's the one for me. She's all I really need. Cause she's the one for me. Emptiness is loneliness, and lonliness is cleanliness. And cleanliness is godliness, and god is empty just like me. Intoxicated with the madness, I'm in love with my sadness. Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms. The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth. I never let on, that I was on a sinking ship. I never let on that I was down. You blame yourself, for what you can't ignore. You blame yourself for wanting more. She's the one for me. She's all I really need. She's the one for me. She's my one and only"
