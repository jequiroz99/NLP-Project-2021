drops of jupiter,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere. With drops of jupiter in her hair. She acts like summer and walks like rain. Reminds me that there's a time to change. Since the return of her stay on the moon. She listens like spring and she talks like June. But tell me did you sail across the sun. Did you make it to the milky way. To see the lights all faded. And that heaven is overrated. Tell me did you fall for a shooting star. One without a permanent scar. And did you miss me. While you were looking for yourself out there.. Now that she's back from that soul vacation. Tracing her way through the constellation. She checks out mozart while she does tae-bo. Reminds me that there's room to grow. Now that she's back in the atmosphere. I'm afraid that she might think of me as. Plain old jane told a story about a man. Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land. Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet. Did you finally get the chance. to dance along the light of day. And head back to the milky way. And tell me did venus blow your mind. Was it everything you wanted to find. And did you miss me. While you were looking for yourself out there. Can you imagine, no love, pride, deep fried chicken. Your best friend always stickin up for you. (even when I know you're wrong)?. Can you imagine no first dance. Freeze dried romance. 5 hour phone conversation. The best soy latte' that you ever had and...Me?. But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?. Did you finally get the chance. to dance along the light of day. And head back toward the milky way?. Tell me did you sail across the sun?. Did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded. And that heaven is overrated?. Tell me did you fall for a shooting star,. One without a permanent scar?. And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?. Nanananananananananananana. And did you finally get the chance. to dance along the light of day?. And did you fall for a shooting star?. Fall for a shooting star?. And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?"

Hold our cell phones up in the air. And just be glad we made it here alive. On a spinning ball in the middle of space. I love you from your toes to your face. [Chorus]. Love, love. Got to have something to keep us together. Love, love. That's enough for me. You can move in. I won't ask where you've been. 'Cause everybody has a past. When we're older. We'll do it all over again.

angel in blue jeans,And though I never got her name. Or time to find out anything. I loved her just the same. And though I rode a different road. And sang a different song. I'll love her till my last breaths gone. Like a river made of silver. Everyone came running to the scene. I was shot down in cold blood. By an angel in blue jeans. Late that night she got away. I chased her to the turnpike. Then lost her where the music never plays. And though I rolled upon the stones and fell into the water. I'll love her till my judgment day. Like a sunrise made of white lies. Everything was nothing as it seems. I was shot down in cold blood. By an angel in blue jeans. I hear voices calling all around. I keep falling down. I think my heart could pound right out of me. I see a million different ways. To never leave this maze alive. I woke up in somebody's arms. Strange and so familiar. Where nothing could go wrong. Barely alive or nearly dead. Somehow awake in my own bed. And there you are. Like a highway headed my way. Life is but a dream. I was shot down by your love. My angel in blue jeans

She’s on fire. And if I could be inside her light. I would steal enough to make my way into the night. And if I could be inside her light I might just find I’d be alright. Well it’s not just a daydream if you decide to make it your life. And this is not between us but between us let’s keep getting back to where it’s from. She’s on fire. She’s on fire. She’s on to me.

cab,"New York snow this time of year. There's nothing more beautiful to me. Except for you. Making my way on the town. And I'm seeing familiar places, faces. In my pile of coffee grounds.

I need to know that things are gonna look up. ‘Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup. When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head. When you can feel the world shake from the words that are said. And I'm calling all angels. I'm calling allyou angels. I won't give up. If you don't give up. I need a sign to let me know you’re here. ‘Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear. I want a reason for the way things have to be. I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me. And I’m calling all angels. I’m calling all you angels. When children have to play inside so they don’t disappear. And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don’t talk for years. And futbol teams are kissing Queens and losing sight of having dreams. In a world that what we want is only what we want until it’s ours. I’m calling all angels. I’m calling all you angels

Feels like I'm leaving home instead. I remember these streets. I had my both feet on the ground while my head was in all of the clouds. I was something to see. Nothing ever came free. She was mine when love meant nothing to me. Coming home. Is just another cruel reminder knowing that I'll never find her here. Coming home. Was living on a trampoline.

Hold our cell phones up in the air. And just be glad we made it here alive. On a spinning ball in the middle of space. I love you from your toes to your face. [Chorus]. Love, love. Got to have something to keep us together. Love, love. That's enough for me. You can move in. I won't ask where you've been. 'Cause everybody has a past. When we're older. We'll do it all over again. When everybody else is getting out of bed. I'm usually getting in it. I'm not in it to win it. I'm in it for you. If it's love. And we're two birds of a feather. Then the rest is just whenever. Then the rest is just whenever. If it's love. And we decide that it's forever. No one else could do it better. And if I'm addicted to loving you. And you're addicted to my love, too. We can be them two birds of a feather. That flock together. Love, love. Got to have something to keep us together. Love, love. Got to have something to keep us together. Love, love. That's enough for me"
if you leave,"Sweet dreams from Texaco, and I know your mind is on. its way to Mexico, sweet Jesus is on his way to take. you on his way down. You get your fill of what you like and you fill your head. with what you might want yourself to be when you're ready. But if you leave. It's gonna get a little easier to break down. And if you leave. It's gonna get a little bit easier for you to break down. My new dress is your new way out, my new way is your new. dress, and you look fine. But your new belief is my regret and my regret. leaves you to believe that we have found the line. And if you leave. Take me along, anywhere is ok. And if you leave. Take me along, anywhere is ok. Think back and you can feel me movin through you. It's easy when you try. Think back and you can feel me. Well you won't feel me. You can't feel me if you leave. And if you leave.

just a memory,"Come back, come back, come back baby. School bells, wishing wells, sun burns, long turns. Dui's, fake ids, first kiss to the fugees. Breaking in, breaking out. The man on the radio knew what we were thinking about. When we didn't even know what we were drinking about. Wedding bells, nursery rhymes. Thrift shops and five and dimes. Move home, quit the life. Wasn't ready for the nine to five. Breaking up, breaking down. The girl at the bank, she knew what we were fighting about. When we didn't even know what I was writing about. Love I guess, is there anything else?. Come back, come back, high or low. Before you're just a girl I used to know. And who will melt with me. When I am who you used to love. And you are just a memory. Come back, come back, come back baby. For I am who you used to love. And you are just a memory. Sunshines, intervention, rose pay with good intentions. Birthdays, condolences, on the wagon or so she says. Play the game, the papers came, no one wins, nobody to blame. Everybody's right but no one's wrong. But where have all the good times gone?. Lawyers ask me if I wanted war. And I don't remember what I was fighting for, no. Love I guess, is there anything else?. Come back, come back, high or low. Before you're just a girl I used to know. And who will melt with me. When I am who you used to love. And you are just a memory. Come back, come back, come back baby. For I am who you used to love. And you are just a memory. No I'm dying to let you know. Every time you leave it kills me slowly. If you go now it'll be the last time. I'm sailing away on these tears that I'm crying, oh. Come back, come back, high or low. Before you're just a girl I used to know. And who will melt with me. When I am who you used to love. And you are just a memory. Come back, come back, high or low. Before you're just a girl I used to know. And who will melt with me. When I am who you used to love. And you are just a memory. Come back, come back, come back baby. For I am who you used to love.

let it roll,Tried to write a letter. To tell you how I feel. But all I kept on writing. Was slipping on the tears from the day. When I was young and brave. Now all these hotel lobbies are filled with what’s to me. Lonely midnight drivers. Drifting out to sea. And all those late night lovers. Don’t make things better to me. So let it roll into me. Let it roll into you. Let it roll into me. Let it roll back into when I had you. So I’ll watch the snow come calling. And I’ll celebrate the spring. I’ll feel the falls keep falling. And when the summers come. I will pretend that I don’t notice. That this is when I notice most of all. So let it roll into me. Let it roll into you. Let it roll into me. Let it roll back into when I had you. And all you ever wanted for me. Was the time to understand. And all I ever wanted for you. Was to see me shining for you. And I wish that I could be back in the day that I could say. Let it roll. Let it roll into me. Let it roll. Let it roll into you. Let it roll back into when I had you.
lincoln avenue,"Well I guess this is where I left my life. And all its operations. And I know that I will never get this twice. With all negotiations. This feels like the place between what is and might have been. So I guess this is where we both find out. If this was meant to be. And I’ll tell myself, I don’t need you. I’ll tell myself enough to get me through. But I’ll finally show you how I should have been being with you every day. If you can take a little more. Now it takes me back to times on Lincoln Avenue. When you said you’d never get tired of the boy. That seemed to be so far from growing up. But we were different then. This feels like the place between being ready and being in the way. And I'll tell myself, I don’t need you. I'll tell myself enough to get me through. But I’ll finally show you how I should have been being with you every day. If you can wait a little more. This feels like the time that I’m ready for you. Are you ready for me. 'Cause I’ll tell myself I'll make it through. I’ll tell myself anything to get over you. And I won't blame you but I'm finally ready to show you. That I'm ready to show you, I'm ready to show you, yeah. I'll tell myself that I never needed anybody anyway, but anyway. I need you. I need you now. I need you now. I'm ready now"

meet virginia,"She doesn't own a dress. Her hair is always a mess. If you catch her stealin' she won't confess. She's beautiful. She smokes a pack a day. Oh, wait, that's me, but anyways. She doesn't care a thing about that hair. She thinks I'm beautiful. She never compromises. Loves babies and suprises. Wear high heels when she excersizes. Ain't that beautiful?. Meet Virginia. Well she wants to be the Queen. Then she thinks about her scene. Pulls her hair back as she screams. I don't really wanna be the queen. Her daddy wrestles alligators. Mamma works on carburetors. Her brother is a fine mediator for the President. Well here she is again on the phone. Just like me, hates to be alone. We just like to sit at home and rip on the President. Meet Virginia. Well she wants to live her life. Then she thinks about her life. Pulls her hair back as she screams. I don't really wanna live this life. She only drinks coffee at midnight. When the moment is not right. Her timing is quite unusual. You see her confidence is tragic. But her intuition magic. And the shape of her body - unusual. Meet Virginia-I can't wait to. Meet Virginia-Yea. Chorus I & 2"
mermaid,Whoaaaah. Whoah. Can't swim so I took a boat. To an island so remote. Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before. I stayed there 'til the air was clear. I was bored and out of tears. Then I saw you washed up on the shore. I offered you my coat. Thank Goddess love can float. Crazy how that shipwreck. Meant my ship was coming in. We talked 'til the sun went down. Love on the Puget Sound. My treasure map was on your skin. Beauty in the water. Angel on the beach. Ocean's daughter. I thought love was out of reach. 'Til I got her. Had I known it could come true. I would have wished in '92. For a mermaid just like you. Whoaaah. Just like you. Whoaaah. Sharks green with envy. They wondered what you see in me. Funny but sometimes can't help. But wonder that as well. Now life is a holiday. Making up for the years I paid. The way to this heavenly bay. It went through hell. Beauty in the water. Angel on the beach. Ocean's daughter. I thought love was out of reach. 'Til I got her. Had I known it could come true. I would have wished in '92. For a mermaid just like you. Whoaaah. Just like you. Whoah. I rescued you by the banyan tree. All the girl fish in the sea. Couldn't hold a candle to 'ya. They don't have a handle on 'ya. They don't have a scandal on ya. I love Ecco sandals on 'ya. Saving me was B-I-G. All the boy fish in the sea. They all wish that they could be me. Can't swim so I took a boat. To an island so remote. Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before. Beauty in the water. Angel on the beach. Ocean's daughter. I thought love was out of reach. 'Til I got her. Had I known it could come true. I would have wished in '92. For a mermaid just like you. Whoaaah. Just like you. Whoah. Just like you. Whoaaah. Just like you. Whoah
mississippi,They call her Mississippi. But she don’t flow to me. Spends her light on the Bayou. But she don’t come to see. She’s the one that makes my dreams. They call her Mississippi. But she don’t flow to me. The shape of her horizon. Makes the morning sun. When she puts her eyes on. Each and anyone. She’s the one that makes me fall. Midnight moon shines through it all. She’s the one that makes me fall. Midnight moon shines through it all. She’s the one that makes my dreams. They call her Mississippi. But she don’t flow to me. They call her Mississippi. But she don’t flow to me.

And smacked your head. Or your face or somethin’. I don’t need nobody flyin’ in my jet stream. Take the bus. Go on and get yourself your own dream. This is my own life keepin’ me down. Where I wanna be in my private nation. I’m alone all thinkin’ life’s a phone call. Here for just a while when in my private nation. You can ride or you can go. Why you gonna step on shoes. When you don’t know whose been in ‘em. Have you ever been more than a bump. On a rock that likes to roll. In the middle of a soup bowl in the sky. Use your eyes. It’s all you got till you die. I don’t need nobody flyin’ in my jet stream. Take the bus. Go on and get yourself your own dream. You can ride on, it ain’t free. Leave a light on, so you can see. How to get back when you go. How to get, how to give. How to make ends meet. How to lose, how to win. How to stay on the seat. How to use momentum to keep the two wheels straight. How to wait after it feels like you waited so long"

Now take a look at this reputation. It's not what it is but what it's not. It ain't some new sensation. But it keeps getting better and better and. Used to spend time thinking there's a reason. Now I spend time knowing I'm in season. I ain't no new temptation. But I'm better than I ever been. And I've been running away from you for way too long. And all my trying, all your lying, all of your crying,. I kept buying it. I've waited too long. (chorus x2). by Ellba ""Rocker"" Larysa"

save the day,"Ten pounds too much to the naked eye. I don't take the bus because she drives. Watermelon lipstick, and way too much. She got buttermilk smile and a thorny touch. Street smart, like a Courtney Love. Can't get enough Hollywood stories of. Anybody famous that can make her feel. Like they're all kinda friends in a way. No best friend, well one but she's crazy. Grew up to end up a Professor of lazy. The last of six kids that all left town. Seems nobody ever wanted them around. But she's cool like a soda can sittin' on ice. Always orders sushi, only eats the rice. Talks about J Lo like they're best of friends. I think she loves me, but it all depends. Hey baby, I don't wanna be your Superman. I just wanna be your man and I'll be super, baby. You'll be standin' in the sun shine. I'll be standin' right here in the rain. You save me and I will save the day. I got a sweet gig rakin' in the cash with karaoke. I get the crowd goin' when I sing the hokey pokey. I shake it to the. left and then I shake it to the right. What's not to love, man I'm on tonight. I got the LA stylie with the New York trim. Keep my pants so low. It's like I'm goin' for a swim. I got the Coppertone tan, like in Mexico. Well, not now but when I go, yea. I know you don't see me like a movie star. And it can't help much that I don't have no car. But you're my favorite thing, by far. That's gotta count for something"

she couldn't laugh,"This is a song by TWARRES and NOT by Train!. Text seems to be allright.... . When I saw you guys dancing in the sun,. a shadow fell on my heart. You were the worst mistake she ever made.. And she laughed too loud at your jokes,. yes I know you were funny. But I couldn’t laugh…. because I knew were it would lead.. Now the anger has drowned out all the jokes,. she doesn't laugh anymore,. See the pain in her smile.. And she’s tried,. yes she’s tried to run away,. but you would not let her go. You are her ball and her chain.. Now I wish you were dancing in the sun,. but the steps were all wrong. So release her from her chains now.. With your jokes you imprisoned her heart,. you never gave her a chance. She never knew you couldn’t dance."

son of a prison guard,"There was a mountain on the table. Of bills that needed paid. Dishes in the kitchen sink like dreams that never fade. A wild imagination of convicts in the yard. Never enough time to make ends meet. So they put it on a credit card, don't we all?. You may not know just where you came from. But once upon a time. There was a carpenter, a bartender, a broken fishing line. Just south of royal teeth in the town that I came from. There were architects and astronauts. But the only one she loved was a prison guard. And that's the only time I ever saw true love. And erica's a girl I liked in georgia. Alone and kept me warm in eugene. I guess my mother bless her heart. Set the bar too high to start. What's fine enough to me is just too hard. For a son of a prison guard. There's a gate that needed painting. Clothes that needed clean. They'd say there's time enough. For that when the fun has all been seen. Cause when we're laying on our death bed. A promise we won't say. Wish we would have worked more, baby. Instead of loving you that way, no way. And that's the only time I ever saw true love. Segourney is a girl I met in brooklyn. Herris got me close in new orleans. I guess my mother bless her heart. Set the bar too high to start. What's fine enough to me is just too hard. For a son of a prison guard. I go wherever you are, whoever you are. I go wherever you are, whoever you are. I go wherever you are, whoever you are. I go wherever you are. Betty is a girl I knew in charlotte. Left for sydney yesterday. I guess my mother bless her heart. Set the bar too high to start. What's fine enough to me is just too hard.

swaying,"Don't talk too fast to me-slow-I wanna know. Share your philosophy before you go-I wanna know. If I knew better, I wouldn't wanna say. If I knew better, I wouldn't let the words feel this way. Cold, so cold, like I woke up on the street. But isn't that the payback for being indiscreet. If I knew better, I'd climb up on my ego like a child.. If I knew better, I'd knock down the flag. on your shoulder that's Swaying. If I knew better-I wouldn't change a thing. So don't you talk so fast to me, slow I wanna know."

I was on a plane. The world would never be the same. The artificial heart is born. Ironic when New York's is torn out. Woah-oah-oah-oah. 2004. Began in May. On tour when I met ya. Facebook joins the Internet. Oldsmobile joins the cassette. I met your family. It took a while until you kissed me. But when you did. I finally felt at home. I stopped believin'. Although Journey told me 'don't'. Before I call it a day. Maybe this'll be my year. Maybe this'll be my year. Maybe this'll be my year. Maybe this'll be my year. 2012. And all I know. Is everybody comes and goes. Everybody sings and cries. Makes the grade and takes the prize. In somethin', nothin', I don't care. Because I always know that you'll be here. With me"

And I can always find my way when you are here. And every word I didn't say that caught up in some. busy day. And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have. before. And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all. up in a kiss. And pick you up in all of this when I sail away. while I float upon this ocean. I can feel you like a notion that I hope will never leave. Cause when I look to the sky something tells me. you're here with me. And you make everything alright. And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me. you're here with me. And I can always find my way... Whether I am up or down,or in or out,or just plane. overhead. Instead it feels like it is impossible to fly. But with you I can spread my wings. to see me over everything that life may send me. When I am hoping it won't pass me by. And when I feel like there is no one that will ever. know me. There you are to show me. When I look to the sky something tells me. you're here with me. And you make everything alright. When I feel like I'm lost something tells me. you're here with me. And I can always find my way when you are here"

That's when the fog rolls in!. Ooo. I'm losing you!. Ooo. You're losing me too!. So much for sowing up. So this is growing up. Everything is going up for sale. The fog kept on rolling in. The time came to sink or swim. They say it's better to try and fail. I take a deep breath with my hand on the door. Afraid cause I'm not gonna see you anymore. These were our tender years, this was our street. All of our stop lights and all our concrete.. Now it's all somebody else's to take. Until the fog rolls in"
