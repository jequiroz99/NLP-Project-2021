You can't play on broken strings. You can't feel anything. That your heart don't want to feel. I can't tell you something that ain't real. Oh the truth hurts. And lies worse. How can I give anymore. When I love you a little less than before. what are we doing. We are turning into dust. Playing house in the ruins of us. Running back through the fire. When there's nothing left to save. It's like chasing the very last train. When it's too late. Too late. Oh it tears me up. I try to hold on but it hurts too much. I try to forgive but it's not enough. To make it all okay.

too late for lullabies,OOhh. It's a sad song that has no end. It's a bleeding heart that never mends. A minor miracle we can still pretend. After so long. Did the apple fall too far from the tree?. Did we get lost in the space in-between?. But the roots that we buried so deep. Will always be strong. Too late for lullabies. Too soon for it alright. Love takes its toll sometimes. Let's start a clean slate. Mistakes are moments in time. For every time. You ever raised up your hand. I'll give you mine. To show you I understand. You taught me to fly. By love by learning to fall. OO yeah. Love burns when it's in the blood. And god knows I burnt you. The best I could. How can three words. Be so misunderstood?. We got it so wrong. Yeah the greatest gift. That you ever gave to me. You don't know your strength. 'till you've faced defeat. So when everything's just out of reach. Keep holding on. Too late for lullabies. Too soon for it alright. Love takes its toll sometimes. Let's start a clean slate. Mistakes are moments in time. For every time. You ever raised up your hand. I'll give you mine. To show you I understand. You taught me to fly. By love by learning to fall. We built a brick wall. But it's all for nothing. Only bridges will cross this divide. We both know this road. Leads to nowhere. There is nothing left for you to hide. Too late for lullabies. Too soon for it alright. Love takes its toll sometimes. Let's start a clean slate. Mistakes are moments in time. For every time. You ever raised up your hand. I'll give you mine. To show you I understand. You taught me to fly. By love by learning to fall. Too late for lullabies. Too soon for it alright. Love takes its toll sometimes. Let's start a clean slate. Mistakes are moments in time. For every time. You ever raised up your hand. I'll give you mine. To show you I understand. You taught me to fly. By love by learning to fall. Too late for lullabies. Too soon for it alright. Love takes its toll sometimes. Let's start a clean slate. Mistakes are moments in time
come back to me,It almost feels like winter. So cold when you're around. It's lonely in this silence. And I wonder if it's something that I did to break you down. It seems around the universe. What was awkward then has gotten so much worse. It almost feels like winter. So come back to me. Come back to me. Was it me that lost you. Or did you try to lose yourself. I'm caught between not knowing and blaming myself. There must be somewhere that you go. Or did you think that I didn't want to know. Was it me that lost you. Oh come back to me. Come back to me. So simple then. No it's no happy ending. I could see it. Emptiness behind the smile you show. So let's just stop pretending. We're both tired of trying so. Let's try to let this go. And I know that I can't break down this wall. I can stand to wait for it to fall. And if you really love me. I know that you'll come back to me. Come back to me

That it’s all going to work out fine. We can live with the doubt. We’re trying to do without. Maybe we don’t have to fight. It’s a beautiful life. Well, you won’t always see it that way. When you’re deep in a hole with nowhere to go. And you can’t see it change. (it’s a beautiful life). Coz it’s just out of sight. It’s a beautiful life. I tried so hard to keep hanging on.

And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now.. It's the better thing to do,. It's time to surrender,. It's been too long pretending.. Theres no use in trying,. When the pieces don't fit anymore,. Pieces don't fit here anymore.. Will you pull me under,. if I had to give in?. Such a beautiful myth,. That's breaking my skin.. Well I'll hide all the bruises,. I'll hide all the damage thats done..

That you had your reasons. I'm scared of all this emotion. For years I've been holding it down. For years I've been holding it down. This girl tries her best everyday. But it's all gone to waste 'cause there's no one around. This girl she can draw, she can paint. Likes to dance, she can skate. Now she don't make a sound. We'll play in the park.

Not to mention fishing poles. Oh, the water. Oh, the water. Oh, the water. Let it run all over me. Chorus. On the way back home we sang a song. But our throats were getting dry. Then we saw the man from across the road. With the sunshine in his eyes. Well he lived all alone in his own little home. With a great big gallon jar. There were bottles too, one for me and you. And he said Hey! There you are. Oh, the water. Oh, the water. Oh, the water. Get it myself from the mountain stream. Chorus"

I miss the fire that was once in your eyes. Well come on and say something now. I close my eyes. I see the ghosts you keep within. Once I made them disappear. You know I did. And did I leave you all alone?. Come on and talk to me now. Or forever hold your peace. It’s all got so heavy. Gonna bring us to our knees. Come on and say something now. Say something.

But people at the station. Are concerned for me. For me honestly. They know I'm just another fool. Wasting all his love. Maybe you took the plane. Maybe you don't remember. Maybe you just don't give a care. For some guy sitting on a platform. Didn't I put you up. When it was cold for you. Didn't I wait around. Because you told me to. Wash me out your hair.

the awakening,"I haven't felt this awake in years. Was too busy drying my tears. To feel the sun was shining on my skin. Locked up in my own cage. Filled up with a bitter rage. I couldn't see the prison I was in. I walked across the line alone. To find a truth I'd never ever known. The truth was there all this time. The only one who couldn't see was me. And I have been waiting for this awakening for so long, so long. I gotta get a little light inside. And I'm here holding out for just one thing. And it's your love, your love.

And all the troubles of the world just drift away. Jump out like a shooting star. I make a wish to be where you are. And underneath your glow is where I'll stay. The only place I want to be. Is right here with you next to me. And I have been waiting for this awakening for so long, so long. I gotta get a little light inside. And I'm here holding out for just one thing.

the only night,"I was young. And I was a victim of her killer smile. Her love was cheap. And it was great for a little while. I had to leave. But she wanted me to stay. And she ripped up my shirt. And left the marks of her disdain. I couldn't take it no more. I couldn't spend another night alone. I couldn't take it no more. If this is where we ended up. Then I refuse to be so hard on myself this time. If everything I have is gone. Then what is wrong in spending time with you. I'll keep you warm, you'll hold me tight. This might be our only night. Be our only night. Oh, I can't give up. No no no no oh. I tried to reconcile. But it never made a difference. You could cut the atmosphere with a knife. It was so tense and cold. And everytime I tried to get a little closer to you. You got further and further away from me. Until you faded into the distance. Yes you did. There was nothin' I could do. If this is where we ended up. Then I refuse to be so hard on myself this time. If everything I have is gone. Then what is wrong in spending time with you. I'll keep you warm, you'll hold me tight. ‘Cause this might be our only night. This might be our only night. I can't spend another night alone. If this is where we ended up.

Then I refuse to be so hard on myself this time. If everything I have is gone. Then what is wrong in spending time with you. Keep me warm and I hold you tight. ‘Cause this might be our only night. Be our only night. Let me hold you, let me hold you. We might never get a chance again. Oh, can't give up. fonte: David Macedo"
the pieces don't fit anymore,"I've been twisting and turning,. In a space that's too small.. I've been drawing the line and watching it fall,. You've been closing me in, closing the space in my heart.. Watching us fading and watching it all fall apart.. Chorus. Well I can't explain why it's not enough,. Cause I gave it all to you.. And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now.. It's the better thing to do,. It's time to surrender,. It's been too long pretending.. Theres no use in trying,. When the pieces don't fit anymore,. Pieces don't fit here anymore.. Will you pull me under,. if I had to give in?. Such a beautiful myth,. That's breaking my skin.. Well I'll hide all the bruises,. I'll hide all the damage thats done.. But I show how I'm feeling until. All the feeling has gone.. (Chorus). Ooh don't missunderstand,. How I feel.. Cause I've tried, yes I've tried.. But still I don't know why, no I don't know why..

too late for lullabies,OOhh. It's a sad song that has no end. It's a bleeding heart that never mends. A minor miracle we can still pretend. After so long. Did the apple fall too far from the tree?.

That you ever gave to me. You don't know your strength. 'till you've faced defeat. So when everything's just out of reach. Keep holding on. Too late for lullabies. Too soon for it alright. Love takes its toll sometimes. Let's start a clean slate. Mistakes are moments in time. For every time. You ever raised up your hand. I'll give you mine. To show you I understand.

But you got fooled by isolation. That its you only. Dragging your bones. When you could be lifted off the ground. Just trust in this little love we got. I know it's not a lot but it's enough. For us to get a taste. And if they say you never will. Just do it. They don't know what they're saying. Just do it. Before you lock it down. Just give it all away. We can do those things we've been told we could never do, yeahh. Love don't need permission. Lets give everything, we hold back, then what can we loose. Now you tell yourself your scared but. Don't you listen. We can love. We can love. We can love. We can love. We can love. We caann oohh. We can love. We can, we can, we can, we can, we can. Ohh nnoo noo. Open your heart. Even with all the complications. It's easy"
wonderful world,"I've been down so low people look at me and they know,. they can tell something is wrong. like I dont belong,. well, staring through a window standing outside there just to happy to care tonight. and I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again,. I tripped them out when God kicked outside everybody's soul.. Chorus:. And I know that it's a wonderful world. But I cant feel it right now,. I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now,. Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea,. but I can only see when you're here, here with me.. Sometimes I feel so full that it just comes spilling out,. it's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily,. but if I had someone I would do anything and never never never never let you feel alone. I wont, I wont leave u on your own,. who am I to dream, dreams are for fools, they let you down.. Chorus:. And I know that it's a wonderful world. But I cant feel it right now,. Well I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now,. Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea,. but I can only see when you're here, here with me.. And I wish that I could make it better,. I'd give anything for you to call me,. Maybe just a little letter. Oh it could start again.. Chorus:. And I know that it's a wonderful world. But I cant feel it right now,. I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now,. Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea,. but I can only see when you're here, here with me.. I know that its a wonderful world. but I cant feel it right now,. I've got all the right clothes to wear I just wanna cry now,. I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea,. But I can only see well when you're here, here with me.. And I know that it's a wonderful world. When you're with me."
you give me something,"You only stay with me in the morning. You only hold me when I sleep,. I was made to tread the water. But now I've gotten in too deep,. For every piece of me that wants you. Another piece backs away.. 'Cause you give me something. That makes me scared, alright,. This could be nothing. But I'm willing to give it a try,. Please give me something. 'Cause someday I might know my heart.. You already waited up for hours. Just to spend a little time alone with me,. And I can say I've never bought you flowers. I can't work out what they mean,. I never thought that I'd love someone,. That was someone else's dream.. 'Cause you give me something. That makes me scared, alright,. This could be nothing. But I'm willing to give it a try,. Please give me something,. 'Cause someday I might call you from my heart,. But it might be a second too late,. And the words that I could never say. Gonna come out anyway.. 'Cause you give me something. That makes me scared, alright,. This could be nothing. But I'm willing to give it a try,. Please give me something,. 'Cause you give me something. That makes me scared, alright,. This could be nothing. But I'm willing to give it a try,. Please give me something. 'Cause someday I might know my heart.. Know my heart, know my heart, know my heart"
you make it real,"There's so much craziness surrounding me. So much going on, it gets hard to breathe. When all my faith has gone you bring it back to me. You make it real for me. Well I'm not sure of my priorities. When I've lost sight of whoever I'm meant to be. like holy water washing over me. You make it real for me. And I'm running to you baby. You are the only one who save me. That's why I've been missing you lately. 'Cause you make it real for me. When my head is strong but my heart is weak. I'm full of arrogance and uncertainty. When I can't find the words. You teach my heart to speak. You make it real for me yeah. And I'm running to you baby. You are the only one who save me. That's why I've been missing you lately. 'Cause you make it real for me. Everybody's talking in words. I don't understand. You got to be the only one. Who knows just who I am. You're shining in the distance. I hope I can make it through. 'cause the only place. That I want to be. Is right back home with you. I guess theres so much more. I have to learn. But if you're here with me. I know which way to turn. You always give me somewhere,. Somewhere I can run. You make it real for me. And I'm running to you baby. Cause you are the only one who save me. That's why I've been missing you lately. 'Cause you make it real for me. Yes, you do. You make it real for me"
