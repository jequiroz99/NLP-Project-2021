hole in my heart,"Don't want you no more, you run my life. Darling you're causing me strain and strife. Will do you no good to sit and pout. Hole in my heart and all my love leaked out. Aha, oh baby don't cry. Don't do it, don't fuss, don't rake, don't shout. Hole in my heart and my love leaked out. Felt a pain in my heart everytime you lied. It broke real slowly, deep inside. Took a long long time, but there's no doubt. Hole in my heart and all my love leaked out. Aha, oh baby goodbye. Don't do it, don't fuss, don't rake, don't shout. Hole in my heart and my love leaked out. Felt a pain in my heart everytime you lied. It broke real slowly from deep inside. It took a long long time, but there's no doubt. Hole in my heart and all my love leaked out. Aha, oh baby goodbye. Don't you do it, don't fuss, don't rake, don't shout. Hole in my heart and my love leaked out. Don't you do it, don't fuss, don't rake, don't shout. Hole in my heart and my love leaked out"
