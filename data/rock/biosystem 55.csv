drop the mask,"Sat on my guilt I think about what I've done. A life won't be enough for making me forget. I am the black angel and my wings are broken. I am the white devil and I have lost my way,. Suspended between these two worlds forever. I will stay waiting for my sentence but together. We'll pay,. I am not the only one who has been wrong. But now I understand it. We are fierce monsters disguised as avid men. I dived in an abyss between good and evil. Suspended between these two worlds forever. I will stay waiting for my sentence but together. We'll pay,. We can't put on a wretched mask to change. Who we are the blood on our hands shows us. That remember it forever,. Suspended between these two worlds forever. I will stay waiting for my sentence but together we'll pay"
get ready for the next battle,"We?re still here can?t you see us?. Bloody, dirty, pissed off get ready for the next battle!. (verse 1). We still have to fight in order to survive. And the enemy is always the same. Our weapons are our hands and our nerves. We walk towards the ring to fight another battle. Life-and-death struggle we walk towards. Our aim against it with no shame. (chorus). Our scars will heal they?ll go away. We have no fear listen to what we say,. You?ll be safe as we say, get ready for the next battle,. (verse 2). We lost a few people yet survived deathblows. We?ve been thinking. To throw in the towel but our skin is hard and we have a spine. We walk through this path. Sharing heart blood and passion we?ll win our mission. We focus on our aim believing with no shame,. (chorus). Our scars will heal they?ll go away. We have no fear listen to what we say. You?ll be safe as we?ll say get ready for the next battle. (verse 3). Others fell down but we keep on going. Fuck don?t stay still! fight with us this battle!. Fight with us this battle!. Get ready for the next, battle!"
maniac,"Yeeeaaaaaaah. Just a steel town girl on a saturday night. Looking for the fight of her life. In the real-time world no one sees her at all. They all say she's crazy. Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart. Changing woman into life. She has danced into the danger zone. When a dancer becomes a dance. It can cut you like a knife,. If the gift becomes the fire. On a wire between will. And what will be. She's a maniac,. Maniac on the floor. And she's dancing like. She's never danced before [2x]. On the ice-build iron sanity. Is a place most never see. It's a hard warm place of mystery,. Touch it, but can't hold it. You work all your life for that moment in time,. It could come or pass you by. It's a push of the world, but there's always a chance. If the hunger stays the night. There's a cold connective heat,. Struggling, stretching for defeat. Never stopping with her. Head against the wind. She's a maniac,. Maniac, I sure know. And she's dancing like. She's never danced before [2x]. It can cut you like a knife,. If the gift becomes the fire. On a wire between will. And what will be. There's a cold connective heat,. Struggling, stretching for defeat. Never stopping with her. Head against the wind. She's a maniac,. Maniac, I sure know. And she's dancing like. She's never danced before [2x]"
remember me,"Winter has come. The colors seem to rest in peace. The sky above me is grey. As well as me. I think about. What is changed in my life. And in the ones. Whom I love. Memories remain. As pictures faded from the time. Remember me for what I am. Remember me for what I said. So I'll be happy and so I can go. Memories are alive. Memories are flying in my mind. I can't stop their flight. A long road?s in front of me. And I can?t wait too long. I must depart for my journey. Because this is life. I may be alone. But I must not be afraid. Because I'll be strong. Remember me for what I am. Remember me for what I said. So I'll be happy and so I can go. Memories are alive. Memories are flying in my mind. I can?t stop their flight. Where will you be when I?m gone?. What will you do when I?m gone?. Look at the sky at night. Look at the sky at night. I'll be above to protect you,. Remember me for what I am. Remember me for what I said. So I'll be happy and so I can go. I'll be rainbow I?ll be wind,. I'll be sun I'll be light. I'll be in the earth I'll be in the world. And I'll protect your days. Because I'll be in your days"
