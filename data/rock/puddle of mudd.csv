They make you restless, it's nothin' you ain't seen before. Get around town, spend your time on the run. You never let down, say you do it for fun. Never miss a play, though you make quite a few. You give it all away - everybody wants you. You crave attention, you can never say ""no"". Throw your affections any way the wind blows. You always make it, you're on top of the scene. You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine. Puttin' on the eyes 'til there's nobody else. You never realize what you do to yourself. The things that they see make the daily reviews. You never get free - everybody wants you. Everybody knows you. Everybody snows you. Everybody needs you, leads you, bleeds you. Nights of confusion and impossible dreams. Days at the mirror, patchin' up around the seams. You got your glory, you paid for it all. You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol. Say goodbye to conventional ways. You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days. The more you understand, seems the more like you do. You never get away - everybody wants you"

nobody told me,Looking back in my childhood. Wasn't to bad but it wasn't that great. I carried the luggage like a bag of bricks. Feels like it's holding me down again. Staring down a pitch black road. Painted lines show me the direction. Sun is burning on my face. Sun is setting me on fire. Nobody told me where to go. Nobody told me where to run. I can't find my way back home. Lost my head down there some where. Could we just be gone alone. Lived in doubt of fear I've shown. Gazing down a long gray road. I see the stop sign way up ahead. The sun is burning on my face. Sun is setting me on fire. No body told me where to go. Nobody told me where to run. Nobody told me where to go. Nobody told me nobody told me. Same old shit different day. Gotta get up. Gotta get up (5x). I cant find my way back home. Lost my head down there somewhere. Could we just be gone alone. Lived in doubt and fear ive shown. Gazing down a long gray road. I see the stop sign way up ahead. Sun is burning on my face. Sun is setting me on. Fire. Nobody told me where to go. Nobody told me where to run. Nobody told me where to go. Nobody told me nobody told me
nothing left to lose,"""Nothing Left To Lose"". Something, something's taking over me. Shaking, bottled up inside of me. Crawling, crawling in the shadows so no one finds me. Hiding, paranoid I suffer no sleeping. I'm annoyed, I think you should shut it. Give me no attention or you'll be sorry. I've got nothing left to lose. You always get your way. Got everything to prove. I saw you turn away. Got nothing left to lose. You always get your way. Got everything to prove. You always get your way. Help me, sitting front of fire I'm melting. Don't you leave me hanging I'm burning. Can't hold on forever. I'm not that stupid. Genius cracking underneath this pressure. Sorry couldn't keep it together. I know I've got it coming, but you'll be sorry. I've got nothing left to lose. You always get your way. Got everything to prove. I saw you turn away. Got nothing left to lose. You always get your way. Got everything to prove. You always get your way. You always get your way. I won't just turn away. Save me from myself. Always get your way. Save me from myself.
