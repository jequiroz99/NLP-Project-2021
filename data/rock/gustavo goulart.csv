With all these good intentions. He's left a lot of things. He'd rather not mention right now. Just before he says goodnight. He looks up with a little smile at me. And he says. If I could be like that. I'd give anything. Just to live one day. In those shoes. If I could be like that. What would I do? What. What would I do? Yeah, yeah. Now in dreams we run. She spends her days up in the North Park. Watching the people as they pass. And all she wants is just. A little piece of this dream. Is that too much to ask?. With a safe home, and a warm bed. On a quiet little street. And all she wants is just. Something to hold onto now. That's all she needs... Yeah!. If I could be like that. I'd give anything. Just to live one day. In those shoes. If I could be like that. What would I do? What. What would I do?. Yeeaahh, hey yeahh. Oh, ohh, yeah. I'm falling into these sweet dreams. We run away. If I could be like that. Then I'd give anything.

everywhere,"Turn it inside out so I can see. The part of you that's drifting over me. And when I wake, you're never there. When I sleep, you're everywhere. You're everywhere!. Just tell me how I got this far. Tell me why you're here and who you are. Cause everytime I look, you're never there. And everytime I sleep, you're always there. Cause you're everywhere to me. When I close my eyes, it's you I see. You're everything I know that makes me believe. I'm not alone. I'm not alone. I recognize the way you make me feel. It's hard to think that you might not be real. I sense it now the water's getting deep. I try to wash the pain away from me. Away from me. Cause you're everywhere to me. When I close my eyes, it's you I see. You're everything I know that makes me believe. I'm not alone. I'm not alone. I'm not alone. When I touch your hand. It's then I understand. The beauty that's within. It's now that we begin. You always like my way. I hope there never comes a day. No matter where I go. I always feel you so. Because you're everywhere to me. And when I close my eyes, it's you I see. You're everything I know that makes me believe. I'm not alone. Because you're everywhere to me. When I catch my breath, it's you I breathe. You're everything I know that makes me believe. I'm not alone. You're in everyone I see. So tell me. Do you see me?"

My girl. I got so much honey. The bees envy me, oh. I've got a sweeter song. Than the birds in the trees, oh. Well, I guess you'll say. ""What can make me feel this way? "". My girl. Talking about my girl. My girl. Talking about my girl. Yeah, talking about my girl. My girl. OOh, Hoo. Talking about my girl. My girl. Talking about my girl"
your body is a wonderland,"We got the afternoon. You got this room for two. One thing I've left to do. Discover me, discovering you. One mile to every inch of. Your skin like porcelain. One pair of candy lips and. Your bubblegum tongue. And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a deep sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break'em. This is bound to be awhile. Your body is a wonderland. Your body is a wonder. I'll use my hands. Your body is a wonderland. Something 'bout the way. The hair falls in your face. I love the shape you take. When crawling towards the pillowcase. It tells me where to go and. Though I might leave to find it. Never let your head hit the bed. Without my hand behind it. You want love, we'll make it. Swim in a deep sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break'em. This is bound to be awhile. Your body is a wonderland. Your body is a wonder. I'll use my hands. Your body is a wonderland"
