Night after night. Need you to know this. Tears me apart. I hope that youre hopeless too. Your pieces are right here. But nothing really fits. I want you to want me. Then watch me disappear. Cause I carry ghosts of the things you said. I lay my bones to rest. I know. We can kiss the past goodbye

The past should stay dead. [Verse 2: Jared Warth]. How did we find ourselves here?. Haunted by our own design. With everything that's come to pass. Makes it harder to confine. Reach up with open hands. Nobody left to pull me through. And if I lose my grief. Still better off without you. [Chorus x2: Beau Bokan]. If you can't sleep, it's your conscience. That's eating away at the mess you made. So let's end this. Sew this last stitch. Lift this weight off my chest. I'll put you to rest. The past should stay dead. [Bridge: Beau Bokan].
