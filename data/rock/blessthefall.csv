To wash away. All this sadness"

Searching for answers when you look to the sky. Say I'm liar, say I'm a fake. I'm far from a saint. So I'll live with my mistakes. If I'm a liar, if I'm a fake. I'll take all these sins. And you can burn me at the stake. Son of God, are you listening?. Son of God, can you hear my cry?. We put our faith into you. How could you just watch them die?. Son of God, are you listening?. Son of God, can you hear my cry?. We put our faith into you. How could you just watch us die?"
