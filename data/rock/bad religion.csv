Where all good men are trampled down. Just to settle a bet that could not be won. Between a prideful father and his son. Will you guide me now, for I can't see. A reason for the suffering and this long misery. What if every living soul could be upright and strong. Well, then I do imagine.... There will be Sorrow. Yeah there will be Sorrow. And there will be Sorrow, no more. When all soldiers lay their weapons down. Or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns. Or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves. It's easy to imagine.... There will be Sorrow. Yeah there will be Sorrow. And there will be Sorrow, no more."

no control,"culture was the seed of proliferation. but it has gotten melded into an inharmonic whole. consciousness has plagued us and we can not shake it. though we think we're in control. questions that besiege us in life. are testament of our helplessness. ""there's no vestige of a beginning,. no prospect of an end"" (Hutton, 1795). when we all disintegrate it will all happen again. time is so rock solid in the minds of the hoards but they can't. explain why it should slip away. history and future are the comforts of. our curiosity but here we are. rooted in the present day. if you came to conquer you'll be king for a day. but you too will deteriorate and quickly fade away. and believe these words you hear. when you think your path is clear. we have no control. we do not understand. you have no control."

In this land of competition the compassion is gone. Yet we ignore the needy. And we keep pushing on. Keep pushing on. This is just a punk rock song.

But we swallow it all and we see nothing change. Nothing has changed. This is just a punk rock song. Written for the people who can see something's wrong. Like workers in a factory we do our share. But there's so many other fucking robots out there. This is just a punk rock song. 10 million dollars on a losing campaign. 20 million starving and writhing in pain. Big strong people unwilling to give. Small in vision and perspective. One in five kids below the poverty line. One population running out of time. Running out of time. This is just a punk rock song.

You got the best of me, but yet. Now i'm shutting down. Stop denying that i'm wrong. The days that i was strong. Are a complete blur to me now. You never kick back. You never realized. What's in my swollen eyes. You got the best of me, but yet. Landscapes surround me. They flip up all these holes. Wasn't that my soul. I've sold it for nothing. You got the best of me, but yet"
52 seconds,know I'm part of something greater than myself. Don't know the meaning of it but I hope that matters less. I don't know anything when I'm factored out of scale. I know I'm part of something greater than myself. We're all engaging in a game of attrition. Maybe god is just a chemical fiction. I'm a monkey with a madding affliction. With fact checking for a mental condition. I know I'm part of something greater than myself. Don't know the meaning of it but I hope that matters less. I don't know anything when I'm factored out of scale. I know I'm part of something greater than myself
a streetkid named desire,"Well, it was punk-fifteen in the morning. And it was time to stand my ground. And as the gawks and stares bombarded me. You know, I didn't even hear a sound. No one gave a damn. If I was there or away. If I died and went to hell,. They'd throw a party on my grave. And they'd all say. ""this kid is just a fool, he'll never be cool. They might as well just ship him off. to some other school"". Plain destitute. Just a little too guilty, just a little too soon. That day was just like any other day. No work, and no pay. I knew that paradise was some other place. And I'd get there another day. I will find it before I expire. 'Cuz I've got the desire. Well, it was punk-fifteen in the evening. And it was time to set the town on fire. I saw my boots and my hair. As reflected in the mirror. Reveal a streetkid named desire. I didn't give a damn. Because I was just dying to be. And as the Hollywood street scene. Left its mark on me. I changed from a boy into a man. I said ""never again!"". I stuck out my chin when I should have ran. Shit in the fan. I was driven so hard. By the sound of my heart. But that day was just like any other day. No work, and no pay. I knew that paradise was some other place. And I'd get there another day. I will find it before I expire. 'Cuz I've got the desire. When the walls surround. In deeper shades of blue. And there's no voice of reason inside you. And you search for meaning. On an empty shelf. Then you're always dreaming. Of somewhere else. Today is just like any other day. No fear, no restraint. I know that paradise is some other place. And I will get there another day. You can come with me,. No conditions or fares. Somehow, somewhere,. I will find it before I expire,."

a world without a melody,"I don't want to live in a world without melody. Sometimes the rhythmic din of society is too much for me. But purpose is prioritized these days, the goal is win the prize.

In elocution sound. The modernest chronometer. uptight and underwound. Pretensions of a higher ground. Higher ground. introspective paradise found. Adam's Atoms resound. Economy of nature. the dead and shallow graves. the particles of happiness. elude us of their names. A psychosymbiotical reflection. on the waves. Eternal is the night and day. Night and day. Omnipresence is losing faith. Adam's Atoms remain. The righteous opposition. has led us all astray. One side against the other. one loses one reclaimed. And if reconciliation. eludes us every day. Then will we ever find a way. Find a way. Not with a religionious gaze. Adam's Atoms remain. Adam's Atoms betray. Adam's Atoms remain"

all fantastic images,England seemed like such a beautiful place from afar. Until one day I went and saw how miserabely how things really are. All Fantastic Images they only are apparent. Propagated just by hope and desire to share it. Beauty was the allure that brought me close to you. Loneliness was the bond that made me stick like glue. All Fantastic Images they only are apparent. Promoted by desperate hope that things are somewhere better. I don't have a thing against fantasy. But to chase it down just don't make sense to me. If you're only hope is simply peace and love. You end up discarding most of what you're made of. All Fantastic Images they only are apparent. Promoted by desperate hope. And the need to share it

at the mercy of imbeciles,"what you do is what you are. and wishing upon distant stars. won't improve the hole you're in. and won't absolve your deepest sin. but action is no gift from some covert and lofty god. it's dependent and weighty all the same. and it's oh so easy just to keep to yourself. then you're at the mercy of imbeciles. now I didn't make up the rules. but clearly we are led by fools. it is wise to know their ways. so you know how not to behave. but sometimes we find ourselves in desperate need. and we look to those of privilege and power. it's then we learn compassion sits inert upon their shelves. and we're at the mercy of imbeciles. no action is no gift from some masked spirit in the sky. it's reducible to flesh, mind and bone. and it's oh so easy just to keep to yourself. but then you're at the mercy of imbeciles."

I'm enchanted by the birds in my blossoms. I'm enamored by young lovers on the weekend. I like the Fourth of July. When bombs start flashing. And I wish I had a shiny red top. A bugle with a big brass bell would cheer me up. Or maybe something bigger that could really go pop!. So I could make the gardening stop. Come out to play. Come out to play. And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day. In my atomic garden. All my scientists are working on a deadline. So my psychologist is working day and night time. They say they know what's best for me.

believe it,It could happen to you. A defect from the wasted outskirts of los angeles. With a crumpled-up pass for the rtd. And no authority or trajectory. On the brink of insanity.

Persistence could prevail. Against the almost. Unbearable weight of the system?. With nothing better to do. And no one else who you can look up to. You'd better believe it. Because it's written all over your face. A political defect. Out of step and out of place. You'd better believe it. And the future is bright. When ideas run astray. So turn out the light.

beyond electric dreams,"o one here can show you where it is but I can point to a sign. On the roof of the world without apparent design. The frozen definition of a lunatic ambition to rise. The air is thin, the future dim, dimension hard to find. Up on a mountain encased in solar rays. Beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays. Coming down a mountain, eons have a human ring. The conversation of impassive planets intercepted by a human being. Ratiocination is a practicable way to derive. An attitude or altitude and probity by which to abide. Or maybe a theophany of flaming creosote in disguise. The air is thin, the future dim, dimension undefined. Up on a mountain encased in solar rays. Beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays. Coming down a mountain, eons have a human ring. The conversation of impassive planets intercepted by a human being. Here glaring cold in the crystalline. geometry of night, obscuring. form and tracing faceless fears of. suprahuman immensity in a. patch of sand or a raptor's guileless. shivering intensity, I'm only. a visitor, an atom of atoms on a jutting. red spattered synagogue. of granite as it crouches literally in. space, a frozen amoral giant. gazing heavenward forever. Let's go where the raptor goes to the mountain in a cosmic glow. We'll have a genuine terrestrial show on a mountain - on a mountain. Let's scan the horizon clean for any trace of human schemes. And try to touch upon immortal themes - on a mountain - on a mountain. Up on a mountain encased in solar rays. Beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays. Coming down a mountain, eons have a human ring. The conversation of impassive planets intercepted by a human being"

billy,"I can recall the warm youth of a summer day, yeah:. The sweetest lemonade, the darkest game arcade,. And Billy had a yearning in the corner of his mind.. It moved him secretly. It moved him powerfully.. But prescience was lacking and the present was not all. And his aptitudes were carelessly wasted.. And challenging life with the abandon of a fool,. He squandered the hours of his day.. Then darkness and disorder slapped him sharply in the face, yeah.. It hit him like a friend, struck something deep within.. He couldn't break the chain of slow decay that seemed to drag him. Just like a fatal tie toward the other side.. And Billy was a lunatic, just barking at the moon,. And his brain was totally wasted.. He then exchanged his friends for a needle and a spoon. And he threw his future away.. Bolt the door and throw away the key.. Your dim reflection is all that you can see.. So where is the justice when no one is at fault. And a human life is tragically wasted?. How fragile is the flame that burns within us all. To light each passing day?"
billy gnosis,"A crack developed and a name blew in,. Billy Gnosis, weak and thin.. He moved to California to start a new life. because back in his hometown he just killed his wife.. He started drinking early back then.. He suddenly needed things that made his head swim.. Then his brain became a factory,. for making chemicals that shouldn't be.. Oh Billy couldn't remember his name.. Billy Gnosis was going insane,. and soaked in blue light, he played and played.. I can still hear the sound he made.... Billy burned his phone and blew up his car.. He sat and watched t.v. and played the guitar. and read a book that made his head din,. how could he have known that there were worms within?. And the worms ate into his brain,. Through his eyes and through his ears they came.. They left a home so they multiplied,. and fed on Billy's chemicals in paradise.. Oh Billy couldn't remember his name.. Our unsung hero, has gone insane.. And soaked in blue light, he played and played.. The only thing that killed the worms like Raid."

boot stamping on a human face forever,"“Drop dead, it doesn’t matter,” she said. “It only hurts when I laugh,” she said. “Sometimes it’s never a crime. “To spend the day in bed”. She made certain that the curtains were red. To drape better by the light they would shed. She leaned back, tilted her head. And this is what she said…. “You can’t win; think it over again. “I can’t win; look at the trouble I’m in. “We can’t win and we’re stuck here together. “Yeah, I hope it will last forever.”. “Don’t ever dare to hope,” he said. “So I’m never let down too bad. “I know there’s nowhere to go. “So I’ll just stay here, instead”. He knew better than to pull at a thread. They unravel like the thoughts in his head. He looked out; it filled him with dread. And this is what he said…. [Chorus]. With good looks and books on their side. And hearts bursting with national pride. They sand songs that went along for the ride. And the other side complied. They said, “Hey, man, where do you reside?. “And could it be mother’s superior lied?. “And is it possible too many have died?”. It’s only natural to reply. [Chorus]"

broken,"She said ""Thanks but I'm broken. I guess ya' must have mispoken. Wanna laugh I've never been chosen by anyone"". She was barely a teen hangin' out in between. Just a part of the scene.

But then in bed, ""that I amount to nothin'"". He won't let anybody show him anything. He was a troubled child. Had been down for a while. Always kept to himself. No she couldn't defend he only wanted a friend. Now he's made somethin' else. It's so sad. No one saw it comin'. The paper said that he hit the ground runnin'. Oh Yeah. I know I'm not broken.

changing tide,Every day's the same routine. Of endless chores and boring details. And you know you're waiting. For the perfect condition for your ship to set sail.

Sisters don't you cry. All embrace the times. Wade into the changing tide. Searching for philosophy of life can be a drag on the soul. Nowadays we pick and choose the pieces. From other people's wisdom of old. But of course the climate's always changing. Clinging to the past has got you straining. Realizing all your most cherished beliefs. Are subject to rot and mold. (come on!). Brothers say goodbye. Sisters don't you cry. All embrace the times. Wade into the changing tide

chronophobia,These rational delusions have got to cease. The second hand has finally got the best of me. I'm too aware about the singularity. That brought me to the edge of time. And it's always on my mind now. They say what has passed is coming back some day. The world is turning faster but it's just one way. And I'm desperate to try most anything to breed. A simple Chronophobia. A simple Chronophobia now. A simple Chronophobia. A simple Chronophobia now. Maybe there's a science or technology. To help me come to terms with my maker.

crisis time,"There's a feeling about myself that i can't understand. It's a foreboding sense that i see all around the land. When the wheel of fortune turns progressively depraved. It's the manifestation of a biospheric decay. Keep yourself in line, there's no design. The new paradigm is crisis time. Luxury was privilege and i knew it all along. But to let human reason get trumped by emotion is wrong. All the bonds were broken when i said i loved you so. But rejection of a fantasy is just a way to help you grow. Keep yourself in line, there's no design. The new paradigm is crisis time. There's a feeling about myself, i feel it oh so strong. It's a romantic notion and i've cared about it far too long. On the crest of progress we can't balance on the wave. If the measure of success is only tallied in the lives we save. Keep yourself in line, there's no design. The new paradigm is crisis time"

dearly beloved,"Dearly Beloved. Here's a story of an honest man losing religion. Climbing the pulpit steps before an eager congregation. The while praying came a wicked inspiration:. Brothers, sisters this is what he said. Dearly beloved, dearly beloved, dearly beloved,. I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you. He was the kind of guy who'd always go right out of his way. But more before that crazy notion leapt right into his head. And stubbornly he crept into every mad perception. I can't deny a funny feeling when he said:. Dearly beloved, dearly beloved, dearly beloved,. I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you. Dearest in memoriam – set phasers to stun. And grab yourself a neighbors' skeleton to lean upon. Did you know him in life – one filled with regret. So soon we all forget – we ever met. Do you know my name – sing a light refrain. For a man estranged – I won't deny that I'm inclined to isolate. Dearly beloved, dearly beloved, dearly beloved,. I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you. I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you, I can't relate to you"

The timeless, swirling gyroscopic horde.. Delirium. Delirium of disorder. Yeah! I am just an atom in an ectoplasmic sea. Without direction or a reason to exist.. The anechoic nebula rotating in my brain. Is persuading me, contritely, to persist.. Delirium of disorder (x8)."

It crackled on the radio. Through bright plumes of the sun. The announcer said the age of faith was dead. Though the adolescent nation. Was just looking for salvation. The beast of reason reared it's ugly head (hosanna). So hold your head up high forgotten man. Tomorrow's not for me and you. And everybody's gotta try to lend a helping hand. For god and man there's nothing more to do. From your cradle of destruction. With the poorest of instruction. And the merest sliver of a tune. You managed somehow to muddle through. So hold your head up high forgotten man. Tomorrow's not for me and you. And everybody's gotta try to lend a helping hand. For god and man there's nothing more to do

Well Hanson did it hester. and Mark David did it to John. and maybe Jack dit it to Marilyn. but he did it to South Vietnam. for beauty and glory. for money, love and country. Everybody's doing it,. Don't do that to me. A bitter debate and a feminine fate lie in tandem like two precious babes. While the former gets warmer it's the latter that. matters. Except on the nation's airwaves. And custodians of public opinion stayed back after. vainly discussing her rights. Lay hands off her body - it's not your fucking life!. I don't know what stopped. Jesus Christ from turning. every hungry stone into bread. and i don't remember hearing. how Moses reacted. when the innocent first born sons. lay dead. Well I guess. God was a lot more demonstrative. back when he. flamboyantly parted the sea. now everybody's praying. Don't prey on me"
don't sell me short,"we don't need any more mountains. Because the trail builders. failed to give us passage there. so we can't reach the sky. We don't need any more failure.

Don't sell me short!. You've been wrong too long. Don't brush me off. Just because I don't belong. Pass me on by, ignore my cry,. forget me when I die. Just don't sell me short,.

drastic actions,"heard a word, suicide,. not from one, but from thousands that tried. the lawyer's wife and the teenage brat,. one thing in common, they all wanted out. and it's plain to see. it goes for you and it goes for me,. and all the screwed up little girls and boys. all thrown in without a choice. but I heard him say,. ""I want out, no complaints and no doubts,. Just a chance to go on"". I heard a word, suicide,. and not from one, but from thousands that died. want some attention and a little less regret, a. teenage fluff, little threat. and there are those, there are those who think. that drastic actions will make them unique. it's really all the same,. that no one's happy and nobody's to blame. and the moral to this story is old. it's quite taboo, seldom told. the seed is reaped before it's sown,. a bad choice was never resolved"
dream of unity,I had a dream...of unity. Where we would walk side by side. But today I see that it's only me. Just trying to get by. Sometimes we strive...undetoured. to walk as one toward our goals. But as people stray towards more selfish ways. we see we have no control ... no control
drunk sincerity,"the smell of virgin pages wafted through the swinging doors. and the croaking speech he'd heard from countries. counselors before. they said ""we all care for you, we know how you suffer. but I know you can succed, I used to have it so much rougher"". there's hope in the words and emotion in the eyes. it's so easy to be misled by the savvy gentle guise. and like fools we trust the delivery. but it's all just drunk sincerity. in maternal family assembly poised regarding the blue tube. the numbers crept up higher and the hawks stayed out of view. then the generals said ""we dont want our boys dead. your sons and your husbands will be coming back heroes soon"". with steam, heat, and rhythm in the back seat of the car. and adolescent perspective projecting life's forecast to the stars. you heard love from the lips and you were rapt by the hips. and the promise was eternal but you couldn't see that far"

empty causes,"everwhere you looked there was confusion, violence, drama and drugs. so many righteous revolutionaries spouting utopian love. everyone shrouded in purple haze. then one day they woke up from their dream state. they found themselves no more at peace than before. older, meek, and conformed. empty causes. a bluster for the soul, a fix for their mind. empty causes. cling to everything you find. well, the shots rang out like popcorn and the Chief was hit and rushed out of sight. the mohawk-chain, leather brigade rejoiced maliciously on that night. someone cried out ""fuck the government"". his mates couldn't define what he meant. so no one gave him the time of day. and the scene died away. empty causes. a war for the body, an army in the mind. empty causes. losing steam as time goes by. could it be that everybody selfishly desires their own personal retinue. and that causes are just manifestations of too much time and far to little to do. empty causes. direction for the soul, conviction for the mind. empty causes. cling to everything you find. empty causes. you've got yours and I've got mine."
entropy,"random blobs of power expressed as that which we all disregard,. ordered states of nature on a scale that no one thinks about,. don't speak to me of anarchy of peace or calm revolt,. man, we're in a play of slow decay orchestrated by boltzmann,. it's entropy, it's not a human issue,. entropy, it's a matter of course,. entropy, energy at all levels,. entropy, from it you can not divorce. and your pathetic moans of suffrage tend to lose all significance,. extinction, degradation;. the natural outcomes of our ordered lives,. power, motivation; temporary fixtures for which we strive,. something in our synapses assures us we're ok. but in our disquilibrium we simply can not stay,. it's entropy....... a stolid proposition from a man unkempt as I,. my affectatious I can not rectify,. but we are out of equilibrium unnaturally,. a pang of consciousness of death. and then you will agree."

What's right is wrong. What's come has gone. What's clear and pure is not so sure. It came to me. All promises become a lie. All that's been reigned corrupts and die. The fallacy. Of epiphany. If it's real for me. Do I have to prove it to you. Why do revelelations made to cold blue untruth. It's oh so relative. So serve me if you don't know what's perspective. What's right is wrong.

""progress will resolve it all"",. saw the manufactures of earth's debris ignore another greenpeace call,. no one could tell me what to do,. no one had the ability to answer me,. what the world needs now is some accountability,. we can't buy more time because time won't accept our money,. if your soul needs love you can always have my pity"
faith in god,"It's all right to have faith in god. But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies. That's when I start to have pity on you. You're living on a mound of dirt.

Your whole life foreshadows death. And you finally realize you don't want to die alone. So you'll always have god. It's all right to have faith in god. But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies. That's when I start to have pity on you. It's all right to have faith in god. But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies. That's when I start to have pity on you. There's people in the world today. Who say they're jewish, christian and such. They're all ignorant fools. They'll tell you you can't have your own way. Unless you pay money and dedicate your life. Or you'll be damned in hell. Don't be feeble like all of them. You have your own brain full of thoughts and choices. So use it don't let them use you.

fields of mars,In the garden where he was cast out by the lord. Flames an Omni-directional sword. For he as ever failed to gather up the fruit. And thus was banished with his loot. He cantered aimlessly through endless. Permutations of night. Seeking a purpose and the meaning of kin. And when it finally came to him. You could've mistook it for the meaning of sin. The women wish him well. Every time he cast off marching to hell. Now if you've never seen a terrible sight. Stroll the garden of earthly delight. Maybe we can make it right – someday I'll see. You. High above the Fields of Mars. He knelt down before the unholy mob – who. Cried was is god. Gleaming outwardly with great pride – and. Prepared to die. The women wish him well. Every time he cast off marching to hell. Now if you've never seen a terrible sight. Stroll the garden of earthly delight. Maybe we can make it right – someday I'll see. You. High above the Fields of Mars. Who cannot fight anymore. Will never love any less. That kid inside of murder. Must be committed. To live a life of hostility. Never asking what it means. When mother nation. Blood and religion. Sanction killing – upon the fields of mars. High above the Fields of Mars

inner logic,"Automatons with business suits clinging black boxes,. Sequestering the blueprints of daily life. Contented, free of care, they rejoice in morning ritual. As they file like drone ant colonies to their office in the sky. I don't ask questions, don't promote demonstrations,. Don't look for new consensus, don't stray from constitution. If I pierce the complexity I won't find salvation. Just the bald and over truth. Of the evil and deception. There is an inner logic,. And we're taught to stay far from it. It is simple and elegant,. But it's cruel and antithetic. And there's no effort to reveal it. Graduated mentors stroll in marbled brick porticos. In sagacious dialog they despise their average ways. Displaying pomp and discipline, they mold their institution. Where they practice exclusion on the masses every day. Decorated warriors drill harmless kids on pavement. Simulating tyranny under red alert. Protecting the opulent and staging moral standard. They expect redemption of character and self-growth. (no equality, no opportunity,. No tolerance for the progressive alternative...)"

Will you hold it close and dear. This will not be made apparent. But you and i are not alone in here. My head is full of ghosts. No apparition. A partition from the host. A temple of cognition. And forbidden to approach. Oh to hell with superstition. There's a stranger in the house. I don't need no exorcism. I need a key. And the lock is inside out. Now meta-cognition is just intuition.

With zest and artistry. Ghost!. Part apparition. A partition from the host. A temple of the hidden. And unbidden to approach
my poor friend me,"I know a man who doesn't have many friends. I know a place where he lives where trouble never ends. I know it's hard for him to read 'tween the lines.

I know this man all too well. It's my poor friend me,. A portrayal of the great dichotomy (great dichotomy). It's my poor friend me. And I'm running out of steam. I know there are people who are cynical and vane. They point their finger 'cuz they can't accept the blame. They live their lives under a blanket of shame. And their progeny crawl from underneath it. Lately I've come to see the solution. And it begins with me. But I'm so fallibly human. I've picked the lock. But will not turn the key. Of people running scared. We live, breathe and die. Off to a world, our time is slipping on by. We have solutions, but don't even try. And I feel I know just who to blame. It's my poor friend me,. A reminder of a tragic history (Tragic history). It's my poor friend me. And I'm running out of steam"

part iii,"The final page is written in the books of history,. As man unleashed his deadly bombs and sent troops. overseas. To fight a war which can't be won and kills the human race,.

past is dead,"Solemn regret, transgressions fill my head. A measure of success is how well to forget. And the past is dead. Strewn about the battlefield of life are the remainders of history.

Now, the past is dead. Let's focus on tomorrow instead. Oh the tragic present said. The past is dead. Who can say what constitutes the most important sector of society?. The dominant portion seek an instant gratification. And are proud of intellectual poverty. I'd like to be empathetic but i can't. The jeopardy is too great to make a stand. Now the past is dead. Good deeds won't help you get ahead. The modern signpost read the past is dead. My next great decision is just lying in wait. The action might turn out to be the world's most grievous mistake.

popular consensus,Some people are almost impossible to live with. Some people have faith in the craziest things. They follow outdated conventions that were recorded. But most of it to me all sounds insane. Maybe that's what you need to get you through the night. Maybe you've seen the light. But you know that popular consensus doesn't make it right. Nothing can go on while forever increasing. The universe expanding is a different thing. But to turn a nasty habit into a virtue. Can't replace the need for charity. Maybe it's what you need to help you through the night. Maybe you've seen the light. But you know popular consensus doesn't make it right. Like the seed of all creation or a doomsday scheme. The future might be bright or bleak. But you know popular consensus doesn't mean much to me

And it haunts. Him every day. It tells him he has no chance. His hopes just fade away. And he lives his life prepared to tear it down. But he can't muster the support.

Oh, obligations never cease. Oblivious of the ways to. give his soul some peace.. Yeah, Papa and his family always on parade. Passing. through the turnstiles, a weekender?s. charade. But time will tell, as their world crumbles. to hell.. What they created was a family story no one will tell.. It?s a photo album too terrible. But the. pride and the pallor continue to swell. And the matron. silently prays.. ?Get me out of here, someone?s got to save the day.?. The children are reminded to do it for the. daddy?s sake. And happiness is ever so far, far away.. Yeah, lost as an island out at sea. Resistant to the. gentle waves of empathy.. Papa and his family always on parade. Tearing through. the turnstiles, a weekender?s charade.. It?s just a sick calamity that fatherhood made, but. time will tell, as their world crumbles to hell.. What they created was a family story no one will tell.. It?s a photo album too terrible. Still, the. pride and the pallor continue to swell as the matron. silently prays."
prodigal son,"Oh can't you feel the nostalgia son I wonder about ya. Modernistocrat Horatio Alger. Clever never hesitating in the baiting ever waiting. For the canticle of manacles abating.

progress,"and progress is not intelligently planned. it's the facade of our heritage. the odor of our land. they speak of progress. in red, white and blue. it's the structure of the future. as demise comes seething through. it's progress 'til there's nothing left to gain. as the dearth of new ideas. makes us wallow in our shame. so before you go to contribute more. to the destruction of this world you adore. remember life on earth is but a flash of dawn. and we're all part of it as the day rolls on. and progress is a message that we send. one step closer to the future. one inch closer to the end. I say progress is a synonym of time. we are all aware of it but it's nothing we refine. and progress is a debt we all must pay. it's convenience we all cherish. it's pollution we disdain. and the cutting edge is dulling. too many folks to plow through. just keep your fuckin' distance."

There's no such thing as hell. But you can make it if you try. There might come a day. when emotion can be quantified. But as of now thereæŠ¯ no proof necessary. no proof necessary. no proof necessary. There's no proof necessary"
punk rock song,"Have you been to the desert?. Have you walked with the dead?. There's a hundred thousand children. Being killed for their bread. And the figures don't lie. They speak of human disease. But we do what we want. And we think what we please. Have you lived the experience?. Have you witnessed the plague?. People making babies sometimes just to escape. In this land of competition the compassion is gone. Yet we ignore the needy. And we keep pushing on. Keep pushing on. This is just a punk rock song. Written for the people who can see something's wrong. Like ants in a colony we do our share. But there's so many other fucking insects out there. This is just a punk rock song. Have you visited the quagmire?. Have you swam in the shit?. The party conventions and the real politik. The faces always different, the rhetoric the same. But we swallow it all and we see nothing change. Nothing has changed. This is just a punk rock song. Written for the people who can see something's wrong. Like workers in a factory we do our share. But there's so many other fucking robots out there. This is just a punk rock song. 10 million dollars on a losing campaign. 20 million starving and writhing in pain. Big strong people unwilling to give. Small in vision and perspective. One in five kids below the poverty line. One population running out of time. Running out of time. This is just a punk rock song.

queen of the 21st century,"From the time she could crawl. She was all draped in macrame'. She was preen and redeemed. In a church that tried to show the way. She was taught to never ask for more. They had no idea of what she had in store. She's the queen of the 21st century. Just a ghost of what her parents thought a little girl should be. Analog heart, analog nerves, analog brain. But a fixture of the digital domain. Woh.... From the time she could read. She could see that there was urgency. No debate, just a spate of ignorance in a splintering community. She could never meet their expectations. Then she came to symbolize the nation. She's the queen of the 21st century. Just a shell of what her parents thought a little girl should be. Steeped in spite, coddled in fear, drenched in novelty. Oh but masterful of sensual technology. Oh.... She's the queen. She's the queen. No rules in her empire. She's the queen. Just libido and desire. She's a lean, mean fighting machine. The stuff for modern media lore. And she always knows the score. She's the queen of the 21st century. Just a ghost of what her parents thought a little girl should be. Fallen star, brack and brew (black and blue?), broken hearts, wasted youth. Rusted cars, twisted roots, mental scars, the ugly truth. Oh.... She's the queen of the 21st century <i>[2x]. And she's a modern day romantic, a walking controversy. She's the queen of the 21st century <i>[3x]. She's the queen."

recipe for hate,can't you feel it can't you see it. the promise of prosperity. it's overwhelming you and me. it afflicts us like a disease. ubiquitous compelling too. we cling to you like crazy glue. and inject such a potent seed. it's best for all humanity. the spread of culture. the sword of progress. the vector of suffrage. a warm and septic breeze. the pomp and elation. the duty and vocation. the blood of the hybrid. it's just a recipe. re-living our ancestry. the frightful lack of harmony. our fore-fothers who led the way. their victims are still here today. now it's time to erase the story. of our bogus fate. our history as it's portrayed. it's just a recipe for hate.
requiem for dissent,"Oratory of hope and glory a whisper and a rhyme. An effigy, a soldier out of time. Citizen and patriot you can't be far behind. The funeral is weighting heavy on your mind. Requiem. Bring the dissident from slumber. Requiem. Raise the rebel from its grave. Requiem. Sound the revolution's thunder. A monumental blunder averted and betrayed. Dig around the cemetery a record of the day. Friends and neighbors in stages of decay. But the saddest thing of all eludes discovery. The stimulus for this somber ceremony. Requiem. Bring the dissident from slumber. Requiem. Raise the rebel from its grave. Requiem. Sound the revolution's thunder. A monumental blunder averted and betrayed. The sanctimonious minions how they grovel at the feet. Authority is populist deceit. Pity yet another casualty's demoralized decline. Just a victim of irrational design. Requiem! Requiem!. Requiem.

How can you care anymore?. It's a dangerous slip,. a conscientious shift. In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip. Lest the state of your resolve makes you quickly devolve to a fundamentalist. You're an archetype,. that they can pin to the wall. As you cling to all convictions like a farm animal in its stall. Never thinking of the bigger world outside. As they take you for a ride. It's a dangerous slip,. a conscientious shift. In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip.

scrutiny,"One – two – three – four – five – six – seven – eight. Days go marching by. There and back I never wait for a confident reply. Truth is stark and leaves its mark as limited constraints. And the most difficult part is accepting what the future may bring. It seems like a lifetime of scrutiny. Wither the path, whether worth the fee. A lifetime of scrutiny. And it seems as though I can't be sure of anything anymore. One – two – three – four – five – six – seven – eight. Years go flying by. No one seems to hesitate or cast an earnest eye. Judgment comes in many forms but never scare or shy. And the litany is long as the confidence is strong in their delight. It seems like a lifetime of scrutiny. Prejudicial waters wash over me. A lifetime of scrutiny. And the words just don't equate with sense or sanity anymore. One – two – three – four – five – six – seven – eight. The faces and the names. Shattered hopes and stolen dreams and no one left to blame. Is it possible to win this pointless mortal game?. `Cuz when death comes it's swift and my friend,. We end up and the same.

strange denial,"A mutinous enemy carved a nascent country. Sweat, blood and valor forms the grit of our history. Bequeathed to everyone: chance and free expression. Substance was restrained and the spirit was broken. I feel a strange denial rhythmic as change. Constant as time. Lonely insistent whispers. Somber as a wave bye bye. Searching for solution, without constitution. Blackcoats by our sides promising salvation. Advocating dogma as tickets to hereafter. Mortals in their prime with their desperate hands in the air. Daunting complex and burning. Rhythmic as change. Constant as time. Conflicts, craving approval. Weighted as a murder trial. Oh, I feel a strange denial. Correct is consensus. Everything else, nonsense. Forward is the hope. Forget recompense. Peace and tranquility is only for the wealthy. Dearth for the masses and inequality. I feel a strange denial. Rhythmic as change. Constant as time. Lonely insistent whispers. Dissipating in the night. Like a lone forgotten light. And no one is helping me"

Enormous things to do, others' practices to eschew,. To be better than you is impossible to do,. But the world won't stop without you.. No, the world won't stop without you.. Your achievements are unsurpassed, you are highly-ordered mass,. But you can bet your ass your free energy will dissipate.. Two billion years thus far, now mister here you are,. An element in a sea of enthalpic organic compounds.. The world won't stop without you.. The world won't stop without you.. You're only as elegant as your actions let you be. A piece of chaos related phylogenetically. To every living organ system, we're siblings, don't you see?. The earth rotates and will revolve without you constantly.. Two billion years thus far, now mister here you are,. An element in a sea of enthalpic organic compounds.. The world won't stop without you.. No, the world won't stop without you.. I said the world won't stop without you.."
them and us,"despite that he saw blatant similarity. he struggled to find a distinctive moiety. all he found was vulgar superficiality. but he focused it to sharpness. and shared it with the others. it signified his anger and misery. them and us. lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers. them and us. dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence. that there really is a difference. between them and us. hate is a simple manifestation. of the deep?seated self?directed frustration. all it does is promote fear and constrenation. it's the inability. to justify the enemy. and it fills us all with trepidation. them and us. bending the significance to match a whimsied fable. them and us. tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence. a confused loose alliance forming. them and us. I heard him say. we can take them all. (but he didn't know who they were,. and he didn't know who we were.. and there wasn't any reason or. motive, or value, to his story,. just allegory, imitation glory,. and a desperate feeble search for a friend)."
there will be a way,"Shut your eyes. See the future's distant shore. March ahead. More enlightened than before. And there's sure to be bumps and distractions. but I know we'll get through. There will be me, there will be you. There will be a way. Unresolved repercussions from your life. Fortified with the vitriol of strife. And you can be gridlocked by predictions,. But you're wise grab the prize. Then revise, realize. there will be a way. Hey... Ho. And I don't know where we are going. but we're here on this ride. And we'll stand side by side. all along the way. Follow me to the future's distant shore. Vagary needn't haunt us anymore. And now it's time to set the agenda,. Learn the past, make it last. Share the wealth, hold your fire,. conserve life, make it right. kill the hate, negotiate."
time and disregard,"Part One. from the bird and the deer who live on the same. to the condominiums that litter the plain. it took time... time and disregard. from the green and the trees that shot high in the air. to the high-business market-men who take all that's there. it took time... time and disregard. Part Two. one more acre, another tree. ""it's all untamed, of course it's free"". one more acre, it seems no one cares. ""another great chance to put a building there"". Part Three. I used to roam, wherever I would. I'd see my friends and I'd eat what I could. we did live together in our borderless state. survival our instinct, nature our fate. today I see borders and my friends disappear. man chooses my fate thus I live in fear. tomorrow the trucks come. I've nowhere to run. my home is destroyed so they can have fun.. Part Four. from the wild natural wonderland from which we all came. to the cement and metal that lost all the game."
tiny voices,"The brown and orange sky holds its breath. As the sun retreats to the distant horizon. And our hearts palpitate anxiously. As we soon will lay supine. And wait for sleep to overcome us. And from somewhere in our black subconscious minds. When we're asleep,. Comes a haunting swelling mass of voices resonating. It screams of forgotten victims and the. Cries of innocence,. And the desperate plea for recognition and recompense. Tiny voices, echoes of our heritage,. Our long and sallow faces turn the other way. Tiny voices, harbored deep within. As we outwardly deny that they have something to say. And if we don't confront them, they will never go away. The billions of tiny pinhole ambers fade into. A morning sky filled with poignant morose wonder. Waking, we bear a cosmetic peace that verifies the turmoil. That we carry deep inside."
to another abyss,"Not long ago, and yet the image is so vague. I hesitate to label it a memory. There was a show of local color and I failed to stray. Cause I had nothing to offer but insufficiency. And you know that it’s such a bitch. When you learn to scratch that itch. A blatant fallibility. Sooner to some, but eventually. All kids pointed in the same direction. While the human masses and their vain conceptions. Obliterate each other with impunity. And you wonder, “what’s in this for me?”. To another abyss. To no avail. The search is bound to fail. To another abyss. To no avail. So long ago I set sail. And it chills me to the bone. That I’m so far away from home. To another abyss. So what should I do now? What should I celebrate?. Given finite means and a penchant to depreciate. How can I still avow and depend upon a state. That cares nothing for my happiness, welfare, or fate?. And I know I can’t explain. The commotion in my brain. Like a terrifying reality. Deconstructed but inadequately. All gets pointed in the same direction. While the human masses and their vain conceptions. Obliterate each other with impunity. And release the weight of history. [Chorus]. So long ago, so long ago…oh, I set sail. And I’m struggling on the way. And I’m waiting for the day (to another abyss). And I’m looking for the way back home (to another abyss). So far away (to another abyss). So far away (to another abyss). (to another abyss) So far away. (to another abyss)"

too much to ask,"a refreshing plunge,. a drink of palatable water,. a deep inspiration on a warm summer day,. a safe stroll in a middle of the road community,. a neighbour who in times of need will not turn away,. I ain't no politician, I am a citizen,. and I wonder if I'm living too far out of bounds. community protection, rehabilitation,. police that serve without legitimate right to maim,. global awareness, ecological guilt,. cultural and environmental awakening,. I ain't no optimist, I try to be a realist,. and I think that we're living too far out of bounds,. is it too much to ask?. could it be the earth is shrinking?,. I can see the walls closing in,. no one can take much for granted anymore. remote control, three cars for every family,. corruption at the expense of the simple majority,. a violent clash, a plunder of the third world,. any wretched ploy that bolsters our economy,. I ain't no blind supporter, I'm a conscious citizen,. and I know that we're living too far out of bounds,. is it too much to ask?. could we keep the earth from sinking?,."
true north,"Unrepentant vagabond. Plot the new coordinates and cast the map aside. Now i gotta ramble on. Navigate the pitfalls and cross the great divide. The mapmaker's legend gave direction and a key. He set the declination but what good is it to me?. I can't see the rationality. The world's not my responsibility. And happiness isn't there for me. But maybe i'll inch closer to the source. When i find true north. (with or without a friend. keep searching 'til the end.). Tempting fate and cheating death. No one ever told me it was going to be like this. Contemplate the randomness. When the mind is willing it gets downright perilous. Overburdened, underwhelmed, their ethical decree. That's your moral compass but what good is it to me?. I can't see the rationality. The world's not my responsibility. And happiness isn't there for me. But maybe i'll inch closer to the source. When i find true north. (with or without a friend. keep searching 'til the end).. When i find true north."
turn on the light,"I had a friend who kept a candle in his pocket,. he used to touch it when the wind was blowing high,. I guess it made him feel like he could buck the system. and when it flickered out we laid him down to die,. turn on the light,. turn on a million blinding brilliant white incendiary lights,. a beacon in the night,. I'll burn relentlessly until my juice runs dry. I'll construct a rack of tempered beams and trusses. and equip it with a million tiny suns,. I'll install upon the roof of my compartment. and place tinfoil on my floor and on my walls,. then I'll turn on the light...... and I'll burn like a roman fucking candle,. like a chasm in the night,. for a miniscule duration,. ecstatic immolation,."
turn your back on me,I've been searching for so long. now the search party is gone. won't somebody tell me what the hell went wrong. we started out so strong. I never wanted to hurt you. I didn't plan to desert you. I couldn't possibly express how much I care. So turn your back on me. Come on turn your back on me. To survive turn your back on me. we're the same as far as I can see. so come on turn your back on me. If I could I would stand outside myself. And pretend that I was looking back at somebody else. If I could do it again would I merely defend it all to the end?. or do the ends justify themselves?. I never wanted to hurt you. I didn't plan to desert you. I couldn't possibly express how much I care. So turn your back on me. Come on turn your back on me. To survive turn your back on me. we're the same as far as I can see. so come on turn your back on me

universal cynic,"Catch a shooting star and put it in your pocket. And your pants will start on fire. One bird in the hand, or two birds in the bush. Neither do you any good, when you're stuck in the quagmire. Show everyone you're not sure that they're telling the truth. Then you can be known as the universal cynic too. Benefit your fellow man with good deeds for the day. And you'll serve your life away. Pennies saved today are pennies still tomorrow. Strewn upon the desk, piled up in the paper weight. Show everyone you're not sure that they're telling the truth. Then you can be known as the universal cynic too. Wipe your opaque eyes and restore your crystal vision. Turn another cheek and exalt in your decision. A bit of exercise for the universal cynic in you. Early to bed and early to rise. Precludes you from seeing the most brilliant starry nights. Sticks and stones can break bones, words can't really hurt. Unless you carry guns, and are hungry for a fight. Challenging the standards, or questioning the established rules. Trying to understand how they can benefit you. Showing everyone you're not sure that they're telling the truth. Just a bit of exercise for the universal cynic in you. The universal cynic is you. ."
vanity,"I'll strike it if i don't like it. Give me a crowd and then we'll have ourselves a riot. I'm a monkey with a brick on my shoulder,. And i'm getting bolder. Let's deny, and in vain,. Let's destroy and re-create a billion strains. And when the joke of poverty's majority is upon us. Grovel and decry our vanity. Disgraced to face our own humanity. In a world that mocks our tragedy. Under-aware and impaired. Terrified by nature's fucking stare. Hear our voices significance behind our animal kin?. On which we're to defend such vanity. Isolated with our own amenity. Entangled by our cowled gravity. Disgraced to face our own humanity"
victims of the revolution,"what will prove to be our big mistake?. short sighted arrogance all for what sake?. our families to ashes, our ambition to dust. our progeny in silence thinking ""what about us?"". but don't forget the dance of neglect. the march for empowering prosperity. the pain from loss and want for mere lucidity. just maternal residue, and I was there too. and maybe so were you. when something is won it comes with sacrifice. it's there beneath the joy, the glory and pride. rarely it's acknowledged but in positive light. consciously omitting the losers' plight. but don't forget the dance of neglect. the craving for community that never was met. the longing for status and the overture of regret. with no one to deter, pathetically unsure. forgetting who they were. just maternal residue, and I was there too. and maybe so were you."
victory,"the velveteen and oaken soothed the lonely child. the parents watched the escort take him while they stood outside. the priest was kind and gentle as he positioned his head. the pain was like brimstone, but the kid hardly bled. victory. instinct over intellect. victory. it erupts from deep inside. history. history is laughing at us. plotting its discovery. victory, victory. blame it on the victory. among the parade crowd there stands a decorated man. remembering how he helped to save this sacred land. his helpless enemy was wounded, both hands raised with hope. he killed him without second thought, with brute force and a rope. so many times, so many lives. test the other side. waiting to see what the maker has in mind. the unsuspecting commoners hum diligent each day. they wallow in their father's sins, as time passes away. the crimes are without motive but they ignore all restraint. the evil sits inside them torpid timing its escape."

you are (the government),"Hey sit down and listen and they'll tell you when you're wrong.. Eradicate but vindicate as ""progress"" creeps along.. Puritan work ethic maintains its subconscious edge. As Old Glory maintains your consciousness.. There's a loser in the house, and a puppet on the stool,. And a crowded way of life, and a black reflecting pool,. And as the people bend, the moral fabric dies,. The country can't pretend to ignore its people's cries.. Cause you are the government.. You are jurisprudence.. You are the volition.. You are juridiction.. And I make a difference too."
you don't belong,"Hey, you, Is there something worth aspiring to? and. can it be found in a record store? well, it's not there anymore. Just think of all the things we did. We were different, just like all the other kids. Missy was a teen blue video star. Tom took his life in his mother's car. Milo went to college but you knew about that. Rodney played our record. Jimmy started riots. Laurie was always quiet, she was battling depression. Hey, you, Is there something worth belonging to? and. can I pick it up for a song, or a diploma, or a worthy cause?. Well, let me tell you that there's nothing wrong. It's just the ones like us will never belong. Jack wore a skirt but he knew how to scrap. Billy went to county on a class-one possession. Wendy went to school while her daddy shot smack. Eugene kept a list. Mugger was security. Mary, she kept her purity. We were all in it together. Yellowed postcards on the wall. serve to cover up the blankness after all. so I will carry them along, like a song, when I'm gone. Hey, you, Is there something worth belonging to?. You know we've been here all along. like a confederacy of the wrong. and I confess it could be prejudice."
you've got a chance,"A rhapsody! Contestants in disguise. A nation of desire. But who will win the prize?. The people stand united,. Reluctantly aligned. Copying and lying. Are the favorite past-time. You've got a chance. To confront the world today. Desperate romance. Is the curse of castaways. What good is skill. If you don't make it to the dance?. Despite circumstance. You've got a chance. Common life depicted on afternoon tv,. Is spiked to give the miserable a vogue identity. Hate your neighbors,. Cheat your friends,. They don't discriminate. Popularity and fame don't care. If you're a reprobate. You've got a chance. To confront the world today. Desperate romance. Is the curse of castaways. What good is skill. If you don't make it to the dance?. Despite circumstance. You've got a chance. I'm tired of all this. Shakespearean misinformation. I want to win the game. You've got the right intentions. But who's got time to think?. You've got a noon appointment,. You've got to hit the links. You're talking in the stratosphere,. You're curled up on the floor. With such a wealth of information,. Why are you so poor?. You've got a chance. To be relevant today. Desperate romance. Is the curse of castaways. What good is skill. If you don't make it to the dance?. (don't you believe what the wise men have to say). Despite circumstance. You've got a chance."
