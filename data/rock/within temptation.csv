somebody that i used to know (gotye cover),"Now and then I think of when we were together. Like when you said you felt so happy you could die. Told myself that you were right for me. But felt so lonely in your company. But that was love and it's an ache I still remember. You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness. Like resignation to the end, always the end. So when we found that we could not make sense. Well you said that we would still be friends. But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over. But you didn't have to cut me off. Make out like it never happened. And that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger. And that feels so rough. No, you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends collect your records. And then change your number. I guess that I don't need that though. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over. But had me believing it was always something that I'd done. And I don't wanna live that way. Reading into every word you say. You said that you could let it go. And I wouldn't catch you hung up. On somebody that you used to know.... But you didn't have to cut me off. Make out like it never happened. And that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger. And that feels so rough. No, you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends collect your records. And then change your number. I guess that I don't need that though. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Somebody.... I used to know. Somebody....

You say that I’m frozen but what can I do?. I can feel your sorrow. You won’t forgive me,. but I know you’ll be all right. It tears me apart that you will never know but I have to let go. Tell me I’m frozen but what can I do?. Can’t tell the reasons I did it for you. When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you. You say that I’m frozen but what can I do?. Everything will slip way. Shattered peaces will remain. When memories fade into emptiness. Only time will tell its tale. If it all has been in vain. I can’t feel my senses. I just feel the cold. Frozen.... But what can I do ?. Frozen.... Tell me I’m frozen but what can I do?. Can’t tell the reasons I did it for you. When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you. You say that I’m frozen, frozen.... .

ice queen,"When leaves have fallen. And skies turned into grey.. The night keeps on closing in on the day. A nightingale sings his song of farewell. You better hide for her freezing hell. On cold wings she's coming You better keep moving. For warmth, you'll be longing. Come on just feel it. Don't you see it?. You better believe it.. When she embraces Your heart turns to stone. She comes at night when you are all alone. And when she whispers. Your blood shall run cold. You better hide before she finds you. Whenever she is raging. She takes all life away. Haven't you seen?. Haven't you seen?. The ruins of our world. She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak. The sun awakes and melts it away. The world now opens its eyes and sees. The dawning of a new day. Whenever she is raging. She takes all life away. Haven't you seen?. Haven't you seen?. The ruins of our world. (fonte: site oficial)"

As she goes gently by. Light as a babys eye. Save on a fairytales dream. And start a new dream

Leave me alone, wherever you came from. Hearing so much voices, no one's talking. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, wherever you came from. Hearing so much voices, no one's talking. Running for something, nothing, in the black of the night. Creeps around you, the invisible force that makes you crazy. I can't remember how it feels to be warm, to be alone.... Without that fear deep inside. Icons of death float on beyond me. Whispering my name and breathing it out. The menace of insanity. Inner voices cry out for action. Defenceless as I am. Lost in the alleged paradise. I'm not sure if I am here or elsewhere. Searching for satisfaction. Beyond the frontiers of my comprehension. Leave me alone, wherever you came from. Hearing so much voices, no one's talking. Leave me alone, wherever you came from. Hearing so much voices, no one's talking. Leave me alone"

Could I have known?. I just took it as the truth. Everyone with a friendly face. Seems to hide some secret inside. Always there to remind me. To keep me from believing. That someone might be there. Who'll free me and never ever leave me

It makes your blood run to throw the dice. It's dangerous, it's what you ['re] like. It's what you'll die for to live this life. We're going on and we'll never stop. We're going on till our worlds collide. It's dangerous. So dangerous. Dangerous"
dark wings,"Why was I one of the chosen ones?. Until the fight I could not see. The magic and the strength of my power. It was beyond my wildest dreams. Dark wings they are descending. See shadows gathering around. One by one they are falling. Every time they try to strike us down. Don't you die on me. You haven't made your peace. Live life, breathe, breathe. Don't you die on me. You haven't made your peace. Live life, breathe, breathe. As they took your soul away. The night turned into the day. Blinded by your rays of life. Give us the strength we needed."

fire and ice,Every word you’re saying is a lie. Run away my dear. But every sign will say your heart is dead. Bury all the memories. Cover them with dirt. Where’s the love we once had.

I’m breathing but why?. In silence I hold on. To you and I. Closer to insanity. Buries me alive. Where’s the life we once had. It cannot be denied. Why can’t you see what we had?. Let the fire burn the ice. Where’s the love we once had. Is it all a lie?. And I still wonder. Why heaven has died. The skies are all falling. I’m breathing but why?. In silence I hold on. To you and I. You run away. You hide away. To the other side of the universe. Where you’re safe from all that hunts you down. But the world has gone. Where you belong. And it feels to late so you’re moving on. Can you find your way back home?. And I still wonder. Why heaven has died. The skies are all falling. I’m breathing but why?. In silence I hold on.

i don't wanna,"I'm on a road of broken dreams. And I need to know why. Seek the truth through lies to be my guide. I'm in a world of doubt and trust, can't deny.

ice queen,"When leaves have fallen. And skies turned into grey.. The night keeps on closing in on the day. A nightingale sings his song of farewell. You better hide for her freezing hell. On cold wings she's coming You better keep moving. For warmth, you'll be longing. Come on just feel it. Don't you see it?. You better believe it.. When she embraces Your heart turns to stone. She comes at night when you are all alone. And when she whispers. Your blood shall run cold. You better hide before she finds you. Whenever she is raging. She takes all life away. Haven't you seen?. Haven't you seen?. The ruins of our world. She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak. The sun awakes and melts it away. The world now opens its eyes and sees. The dawning of a new day. Whenever she is raging. She takes all life away. Haven't you seen?. Haven't you seen?. The ruins of our world. (fonte: site oficial)"

in power we entrust the love advocated ( dead can dance cover),Sail on silver wings. Through this storm. What fortune love may bring. Back to my arms again. . The love of a former golden age. I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take. For now that wheels are turning. I find my faith deserting me. . This night is filled with cries. Of dispossesed children in search of paradise. A sign of a sign of unresolved ambition. Drives the pinwheel on and on. . I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take. When memory bears witness to the innocence. Consumed in dying rage. . The way lies through our love. There can be no other means to the end. Or keys to my heart. You will never find. You will never find

let her go,Well you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missin' home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go. Staring at the bottom of your glass. Hoping one day you'll make a dream last. But dreams come slow and they go so fast. You see her when you close your eyes. Maybe one day you will understand why. Everything you touch surely dies. But you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missin' home. Only know you love her when you let her go. Staring at the ceiling in the dark. Same old empty feeling in your heart. Love comes slow and it goes so fast. Well you see her when you fall asleep. But to never to touch and never to keep. Because you loved her to much. And you dive too deep. Well you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missin' home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go. OO oo oo. And you let her go. OO oo oo. And you let her go. 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missin' home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go. 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missin' home. Only know you love her when you let her go.

let us burn,"The darkness has come to the roses. The fire is reaching the air. The colours that I have created. Are suddenly flying away. I'm not fighting myself, will not follow.

We're running through walls where they stand. Let us burn. Let us burn. Let us burn. I'm searching no more for tomorrow. I reach for the skies while I can. The unknown will always be waiting.

And break out and let me burn?. Oh why, why don't you let me burn?. Why don't you let me burn?. Why don't you let me burn?. Oh why?. Chasing the demons in my mind. Oh why me?. Waiting for chains to throw me to the ground. The darkness has come to the roses. And the fire is reaching the air. [Chorus]"

never ending story,"Armies have conquered. And fallen in the end. Kingdoms have risen. Then buried by sand. The Earth is our mother. She gives and she takes. She puts us to sleep and.

our farewell,"In my hands. A legacy of memories. I can hear you say my name. I can almost see your smile. Feel the warmth of your embrace. There is nothing but silence now. Around the one I loved. Is this our farewell?. Sweet darling you worry too much, my child. See the sadness in your eyes. You are not alone in life. Although you might think that you are. Never thought. This day would come so soon. We had no time to say goodbye. How can the world just carry on?. I feel so lost when you are not by my side. There's nothing but silence now. Around the one I loved. Is this our farewell?. Sweet darling you worry too much, my child. See the sadness in your eyes. You are not alone in life. Although you might think that you are. So sorry your world is tumbling down. I will watch you through these nights. Rest your head and go to sleep. Because my child, this is not our farewell.. This is not our farewell."
our solemn hour,"Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour. Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us. Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus!. In my darkest hours I could not foresee. That the tide could turn so fast to this degree. Can’t believe my eyes. How can you be so blind?. Is the heart of stone, no empathy inside?. Time keeps on slipping away and we haven’t learned. So in the end now what have we gained?. Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour. Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us. Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,. can we break free from chains of never-ending agony?. Are they themselves to blame, the misery, the pain?. Didn’t we let go, allowed it, let it grow?. If we can’t restrain the beast which dwells inside. it will find it’s way somehow, somewhere in time. Will we remember all of the suffering. Cause if we fail it will be in vain. Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour. Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us. Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,. can we break free from chains of never-ending agony?.

All that is keeping me here. I dream of a stairway to the skies. My angel is coming down from heaven to take me. I reach out but then you fade away. Whenever you call for me. Know that I'm only one step behind. I sense this time I may have changed. But one this still remains. I'm torn and the hate still lingers. I slowly start to realize. We won't reunite. I still have to march on through. I dream of a stairway to the skies. My angel is coming down from heaven to take me. I reach out but then you fade away. Whenever you call for me. Know that I'm only one step behind. Is it a curse or a fortune?. Have I been blinded by regret?. Redemption awaits. My soul is at stake. Will I find a stairway to the skies. In the end?. I dream of a stairway to the skies. My angel is coming down from heaven to take me. I reach out but then you fade away. Whenever you call for me. Know that I'm only one step behind. Know that I'm only one step behind
stand my ground,"I can see. when you stay low nothing happens.. Does it feel right?. Late at night. things I thought I put behind me. haunt my mind.. I just know there's no escape now. once it sets its eyes on you.. But I won't run, have to stare it in the eye.. Chorus:. Stand my ground, I won't give in.. No more denying, I've got to face it.. Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside.. If I don't make it,. someone else will stand my ground.. It's all around, getting stronger,. coming closer, into my world.. I can feel that it's time for me to face it,. can I take it?. Though this might just be the ending. of the life I held so dear.. But I won't run,. there's no turning back from here.. Chorus. All I know for sure is I'm trying.. I will always stand my ground.. Stand my ground, I won't give in.. I won't give up, no more denying.. I've got to face it.. Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside.. If I don't make it,. someone else will stand my ground.. I won't give in, no more denying.. I've got to face it.. Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside.. If I don't make it,. someone else will stand my ground."

Therefore our angel not yet fell,. and I try to believe that this nightmare is not real,. Exactly not seeing you,. I know that he is far from where I am.. I do not want to believe that my tears do not cease.. And if you will be hearing me,. Where it wants that it is,. I landed on water you forever.. Therefore our angel not yet fell..

The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen. Forgive me for what I have been. Forgive me my sins. I’m hoping, I’m praying. I won’t get lost between two worlds. For all I have seen the truth lies in between. Give me the strength to face the wrong that I have done. Now that I know the darkest side of me. How can blood be our salvation. And justify the pain that we have caused throughout the times. Will I learn what’s truly sacred?. Will I redeem my soul, will truth set me free?. Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast.

It's the rule that you live by and die for. it's the one thing you cannot deny. even though you don't know what the prize is. It is justified. So each morning you've got not to fight for. But is still doesn't change who you are. There is no feel you'll ever get into. You're untouchable. Cause you're losing your mind. and you're sleeping with wide open eyes. Where is the edge of your darkest emotions?. Why does it all survive x2. Where is the line of your deepest devotion?. Pray that it's still alive. You can't stop yourself. Don't want to feel. Don't want to see what you've become. You can't walk away from who you are. Never get back. Where is the edge of your darkest emotions?. Why does it all survive x2. Where is the line of your deepest devotion?. Pray that it's still alive

why not me,"Some may call it a curse. A life like mine. But others, a blessing. It's certainly a lonely life. But a fulfilling one and the best. It's my cross to bear. And I'll bear it gladly. Someone has to take a stand against evil. Why should it not be me?"

To the world where she belongs. [REF:] In her world of dreams and make believe. She reigns forever. With all her glory. In this world of endless fantasy. She makes it happen. It's her reality.
