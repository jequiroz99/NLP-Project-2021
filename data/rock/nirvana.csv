lake of fire,Chorus:. Where do bad folks go when they die?. They don't go to heaven where the angels fly. They go down to the lake of fire and fry. Won't see them again till the Fourth of July. I knew a lady who came from Duluth. She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth. She went to her grave just a little too soon. And she flew away howling on the yellow moon. Chorus. Now the people cry and the people moan. And they look for a dry place to call their home. And try to find some place to rest their bones. While the angels and the devils. Fight to claim them for their own. Chorus

Neither side is sacred. No one wants to win. Feeling so sedated. But I can't give in. Taking medication. Till my stomach's full. Feelin' so sedated. When I'm in my hole. The grass is greener. Over here. You're the fog that. Keeps it clear. Re-inventing. What we knew. Take the time and. We will too. You're the reason. I feel pain. Feels so good to. Feel again.
very ape,"I am buried up to my neck in. Contradictionary flies. I take pride as the king of illiterature. I'm very ape and very nice. If you ever need anything please don't.

you know you're right,I will never bother you. I will never promise to. I will never follow you. I will never bother you. Never say a word again. I will crawl away for good.

you know you're right (box set version),I will never walk it through. I could never promise you. It's some planes follow dew. I will never wanna drew. This will mean I'll love again. Guess I'll never have a fan. This will mean me to me. I could never have a seam. It's a neverending dream. I will always want to faint. If I'm me you'll never know. Everything I ever know. Free. It's another point of view. Look at me when I was you. I could never die again. I won't lose another friend. She will see another me. When I'm through I'll meditate. Guess I'll know I'll medicate. Guess I'll fall and medicate. This'll never open hate. For me is here to say. Me. Ring. Hmmmm. I will never promise you. Ring
