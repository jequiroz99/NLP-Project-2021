And say goodnight to the silver of old. Even when wrong we're right. Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold. I've come to realize. Where happiness lies. I want you to know I know. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets no remorse

dandelion,Settle down now and sit with me. Let me tell you how this all came to be. A yellow flower with your pedals to the air. And flying on paper wings that brought you here. Summer rolls on in the lazy hours. An ether dream way. Of hummingbirds and clouds. Midnight swims in the cool black waves. And you in my arms as it rolls away. Chorus. Little dandelion.

I don't pretend to know. I'm afraid that all I have missed. Will loom very large when the darkness lifts. Chorus. Little dandelion. Let your heart keep time. Now the clouds are gone. All of your tomorrows shine. All of your tomorrows shine. All of your tomorrows shine. I will ride by your side. Wherever you go. I won't run I won't hide. Just letting you know (x2). Chorus. Little dandelion. Let your heart keep time. Now the clouds are gone. All of your tomorrows shine. Oh oh. All of your tomorrows shine. Oh oh. All of your tomorrows shine. Oh oh.

somedays,"Somedays, somedays, somedays just ain't so easy. Wake up, look around just before you're feet hit the ground. Where they make the oil and street, is where you stand and where you sleep. Black and whites along the lights, plain clothes and Miranda Rights. At the right place but in the wrong life, somedays just ain't so easy. Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays) just ain't so easy. Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays), somedays (Somedays). Just ain't so easy. It's not the fault of anyone as we revolve around the sun. We sleep beneath the same sky but we all see it through different eyes. So if you go or if you stay, standin' still if you walk away. If you bend or if you break somedays just ain't so easy. Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays) just ain't so easy. Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays), somedays (Somedays). Just ain't so easy, they just ain't so easy. Oh yeah. ? (Nobody say it's so easy, yeah). I don't care for somedays. Someone may have done you right or done you wrong. Kept it down from the day you were born. There's no need to apologize for the riot in your eyes. Somedays just ain't so easy. Hey! Hey! Hey!. Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays) just ain't so easy. Somedays, somedays, somedays (Somedays), somedays (Somedays). Just ain't so easy"
sound of a gun,In the here and now I wait. Among the young and the old. Between the moon and the ground I play. With my children in my home. This is for the daughters and sons. Of forgotten ones. Learning how to stand. This is for the innocent unknowns. Buried in the sand. Running from the sound of a gun. And you’re weary. Running from the sound of a gun. In the crack of the blackness I wake. It’s getting closer every night. My city playground is a battleground. Between the wrong and the right. I could run free as a child. I was safe and wild. Naked and unarmed. Now I’m grown and safe in my home. But some will never stop. Running from the sound of a gun. Til’ you’re weary. Running from the sound of a gun. The open mouth of the city. Swallowed the town. With that same old concrete. That I still walk down. And it seems they put a shine. On this place when I was young. But baby I just don’t see it now. Running from the sound of a gun. Til’ I’m weary. Running from the sound of a gun

the last remaining light,Roll me on your frozen fields. Break my bones to watch them heal. Drown me in your thirsty veins. Where I'll watch and I'll wait. And pray for the rain. Curl like smoke and breathe again. Down your throat inside your ribs. Through your spine in every nerve. Where I watch and I wait and yield to the hurt. And if you don't believe. The sun will rise. Stand alone and greet. The coming night. In the last remaining light. Seven moons and seven suns. Heaven waits for those who run. Down your winter and. Underneath your waves. Where you watch and you wait. And pray for the day. And if you don't believe. The sun will rise. Stand alone and greet. The coming night. In the last remaining light

until we fall,"walked the streets without regret. I stood alone and watched myself fall apart. Answered the voices in my head. Slipped through the chain link of a broken heart. When I'm tired and I'm feeling black. Spread the wings upon your back. Take us high above it all. Stroke your feathers until we fall. Back down again. But everything that's any good. I understand that I've been misunderstood. When I'm tired and I'm feeling black. Spread the wings upon your back. Take us high above it all. Stroke your feathers until we fall. Until we fall, until we fall. Back down again. Yeah, back down again. Do you see before you blink. Do you feel before you think. Who do you battle in your dreams. Who strokes your feathers until you scream. When I'm tired and I'm feeling black. Spread the wings upon your back. Take us high above it all. Stroke your feathers until we fall. Until we fall, until we fall. Back down again. Yeah, back down again"

what you are,"And when you wanted me. I came to you. And when you wanted someone else. I withdrew. And when you asked for light. I set myself on fire. And if I go far away I know. You'll find another slave. (chorus). Cause now I'm free from what you want. Now I'm free from what you need. Now I'm free from what you are. And when you wanted blood. I cut my veins.

wide awake,"You can look a hurricane right in the eye. twelve hundred people dead. or left to die, follow the leaders. were it an eye for an eye. we'd all be blind. deaf or murdered this i'm sure. in this uncertain time. so come pull the sheet over my eyes. so I can sleep tonight. despite what I've seen today.

yesterday to tomorrow,Beauty is what the eyes behold. And you burn brighter than most. I chased you thru the midnight streets. To be where I could speak freely. I didn't care what tomorrow held. I felt the world turning only for us. Only bliss now for you and me. Rise up let life's kiss send us reeling. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets and no remorse. We have more than everything. More than man or machine. More than luck. More than fiction. Higher than any religion. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets and no remorse. We'll squeeze the blood out of life. And say goodnight to the silver of old. Even when wrong we're right. Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold. I've come to realize. Where happiness lies. I want you to know I know. And unlike the times before. From yesterday comes tomorrow. When life comes alive the past moves aside. No regrets no remorse
you know my name,"If you take a life do you know what you'll give?. Odds are, you won't like what it is. When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?. By the merciless eyes I've deceived. I've seen angels fall from blinding heights. But you yourself are nothing so divine. Just next in line. Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you. The odds will betray you. And I will replace you. You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you. It longs to kill you. Are you willing to die?. The coldest blood runs through my veins. You know my name. If you come inside things will not be the same. When you return to the night. And if you think you've won. You never saw me change. The game that we have been playing. I've seen diamonds cut through harder men. Than you yourself. But if you must pretend. You may meet your end. Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you. The odds will betray you. And I will replace you. You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you. It longs to kill you. Are you willing to die?. The coldest blood runs through my veins. Try to hide your hand. Forget how to feel. (Forget how to feel). Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel. (Spin of the wheel). Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you. The odds will betray you. And I will replace you. You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you. It longs to kill you. Are you ready to die?. The coldest blood runs through my veins. You know my name. (You know my name). You know my name. (You know my name). You know my name!. You know my name!. You know my name!"
your savior,"People like you, I know myself. Walk in the shoes of somebody else. Whisper to me, my tragic fate. Whisper to me, my tragic end. But don't give me your savior. But don't give me your savior. Say hey. People I choose, life on my own. Burn me your fuse, throw me your stones. Give me your brand, burn on my hand. Whisper to me, my tragic end. But don't give me your savior. But don't give me your savior. hey. People I choose, I know myself. Lay my need out, give you my help. But you give me your blues. And you whisper my fate. But don't give. But don't give me your savior. But don´t give me. But don´t give me"
your time has come,"One fell asleep in the street and he never woke up. One died in pieces in his bed with a mouth full of gold. One who threatened me long ago. I saw him. Melt in the bright light of day. One laid to rest in a field under starlings and crows. Chorus. I've been wandering sideways. I've stared straight into the sun. Still I don't know why you are dying. long before your time has come. One took some bullets in the chest in a deal gone wrong. One got a little too depressed so he went and jumped the gun. One got shot right in the face and somehow he survived. But he doesn't know my name or who I am. And I'm not surprised. Chorus. I've been wandering sideways. I've stared straight into the sun. Still I don't know why you are dying. long before your time has come. I've been wandering sideways. I've stared straight into the sun. Still I don't know why you are dying. long before your time has come. your time has come. I've seen 50,000 names all engraved in stone. Most of them met an early grave years before I was born. All of them left brothers and sisters and mothers behind. Most of their family and friends are still alive and doing time. Chorus. I've been wandering sideways. I've stared straight into the sun. Still I don't know why you are dying. long before your time has come. I've been wandering sideways. I've stared straight into the sun. Still I don't know why you are dying. long before your time has come. long before your time has come. long before your time has come. your time has come"
