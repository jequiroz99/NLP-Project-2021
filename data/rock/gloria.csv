anything for you,"Anything for you, though your not here,. Since you said were through,. It seems like years,. Time keeps dragging on and on,. And forevers been and gone,. still I cant figure what went wrong.. I'd still do anything for you,. I'll play your game. You hurt me through and through,. but you can have your way,. I can pretend each time i see you,. That i don't care and i need you,. And though you'll never see me crying. You know inside i feel like dying.. I'd still do anything for you. In spite of it all. i've learned so much from you. You've made me strong. Don't ever think that i don't love you. That for one minute i forgot you. But sometimes things don't work out right. And you just have to say goodbye. I hope you find someone who'll please you. Someone who'll care and never leave you. But if that someone ever hurts you,. You just might need a friend to turn to.. and id do anything for you. ill give you up. if thats what i should do. to make you happy. I can pretend each time i see you. that i don't care and i don't need you. and though inside i feel like dying. you know youll never see me crying.. Don't you ever think that i don't love you. That for one minute i forgot you. But sometimes things don't work out right. And you just have to say goodbye----"

do you still hate me?,"Been hearing about you. All about your disapproval. Still I remember. The way I used to move you. I wrote you a letter. I heard it just upset you. Why don´t you tell me?. How can I do this better?. Are you out there?. Do you hear me?. Can I call you?. Do you still hate me?. Are we talking?. Are we fighting?. Is it over?. Are we writing?. We´re getting older.. But we´re acting younger.. We should be smarter.. It seems we´re getting dumber.. I have a picture. of you and me in Brooklyn.. On a porch, it was raining.. Hey, I remember that day.. Are you out there?. Do you hear me?. Can I call you?. Do you still hate me?. Are we talking?. Are we fighting?. Is it over?. Are we writing?. And I miss you. (3x). Are you out there?. Do you hear me?. Can I call you?. Do you still hate me?. Are we talking?. Are we fighting?. Is it over?. Are we writing?"
domination,Agony is the price. That you'll pay in the end. Domination consumes you. Then calls you a friend. It's a twisted fall. Binds are like steel. And manipulates the will to be. And it's hard to see. How soon we forget. When there's nothing else. Left to destroy. It's a useless ploy. Your eyes will see. The dawn of the day. And the writing. On the wall. Those words that stare. Into your soul. And to yourself. You will befall. It's domination!. Pushed into living hell. It's Domination!. A now blacked heart. Is reaching out divinity. Body suspended by chains over razors. And nails it's a penalty. Each razor a vice and each nail. Marks the demise of your life.. Grim construction grows. Has life played a trick. Sealed you in brick by brick. Till your end forcing you to bend. Your eyes will see. The dawn of the day. And the writing. On the wall. Those words that stare. Into your soul. And to yourself. You will befall. It's domination pushed into living hell. It's Domination!
