something to you,I was young. But you... you were as young as I was. We use to sing the songs. But now we stand for nothing. And we stopped making love. We kept growing up and now we have nothing at all. Time give me time and maybe I'll give something to you. Cause neither all the stars and the rhymes. Can keep us from falling. What can I say I might look okay but you took it too much. And what can I play when there is nothing to say you broke me heart. And we stopped wondering we kept furthering and now we have nothing at all
your game,"Hey you. Look at me. Hey you. What are you thinking?. Sitting there, drinking alcohol. Just trying to forget him. Cause people always told me. Be Careful with who you love. After you're eighteen. But all I wanna do. Hey you. Talk to me. Hey you. Would you dance with me. Im not a good dancer. But I could try it out. Or maybe you could teach me. Cause people always told me. Be Careful with what you do. After you're eighteen. But all I wanna do. Hey you, hey you. Whats your game. Tell me now. Because I'll play, I'll play with you. Hey you. I love your smile. Hey you. Would you kiss me. Because I've been trying all night. To just spend a little time with you. and maybe you would see me. Cause people always told me. Be careful with everything good on your life. But all I wanna do. Hey you, hey you. Whats your game. Tell me now. Because I'll play, I'll play with you"
