born alone,I have heard the wall and worried of the gospel. Ferry faust it crossed a void. I have married broken spoke charging smoke wheels. Spit and swallowed opioids. I am the driver at the wheel of the order. Marching circles at the gate. My eyes have seen the fury. So flattered by fate. Tonight I'd rather count the warm fuse?. Subtract the silence of myself. I would rather choose a million mind of mystery. Be just the rigor for my health. I wonder why strange rhymes overpower me. Toss the chimneys in the sea. I believe I've seen the finger. To hide extremity. Please come closer to the feather smooth lens fry. Sadness is my luxury. Will you wear torn the cold come before I die. More aware of it than me. Without the glowing stone. The kids are unabashed. Loneliness postponed. My eyes deceiving glory. I was born to die alone. Alone

Somebody please second my emotion!. All men were born to be free, yeah. What about you? And what about me?. This world is filled with hate!. There's nothing left. If you enslave me, you'll never rescue yourself. Well jealousy, as I recall. Has always been man's hardest fall. To conquer fear, well that's quite a quest. Until we do never rest. A child was born yesterday. Nothing but an innocent babe. Someone sowed a bitter seed. How could it grow but a bitter weed?. Society, how can you teach. If you don't practice what you preach?. If all men were truly brothers. Why then, can't we love one another?. Love and peace from ocean to ocean. Somebody please second my emotion!. All men were born to be free, yeah. What about you? What about me?. This world is filled with hate!. There's nothing left. If you enslave me, you'll only hurt yourself. Hey you! Over there!. I want to know why you left. With all your riches and your fancy things. Can you tell me how many friends can you truly say you have?"
common sense,"When you're in some bad light. In the climbing flood. And you kneel before them. It's common sense. It's practical. Lay low. One moment I beg. I bolt. On a thousand legs. What you can't say swallow. At the moment I'm bored. Buried more and more and more and more. I slam my finger in the door of love. God damn the judging. Strangers judge. All I want, all that I want. A burning bush. Or. A button to push. A chance encounter. With common sense. Common sense"

The summer sweet dreaming, april blush. But none of that is ever gonna mean as much to me again.. Hold out your hand,. there's so much you don't understand. So stick as close as you can,. all of the best laid plans. You've got the white clouds hanging so high above you. You've got the helicopters dangling angling to shoot,. the shots to feed the hungry weekend news crew anchorman.. So every evening we can watch from above,. crushed cities like a bug. Fold ourselves into each others guts,. and turn our faces up to the sun.. I won't take no. I won't let you go. All by yourself. Oh no you need my help. When the cold night shakes you like a chandelier. The snowflakes break through the atmosphere,. and melt on the blue breath of the auctioneers and disappear.. Every evening we can watch from above,. crushed cities like a bug. Fold ourselves into each others blood,. and turn our faces up to the sun."

Cry all night. I had a hole in my heart. I had accompanied me. It kept me holding from rolling. Someone in the something like me. Something like me. You don't wanna be. I cry, cry, cry. Cry all day. I cry all night. I cry all day. And I cry, cry, cry. Cry all day. Cry all night. At the open mic. I sing and starve. I fall in a knife. However there's another. Another future to fight. I never took it so seriously. Oh, you're serious? Alright. Watch 'em all fight. You can't fight it. And I cry. Cry all day. Cry all night. Cry all day. Cry all night. All day. Another houser calling.

Into the light. Into the light"

Drowning slow. His memories persist. Out beyond the telescope’s pry. Up above the tallest Dutch dope high. He realized. This mystery is his. Underneath the ocean floor. A part of who we are we don’t explore. I adore. The meaninglessness of the this. We can’t express. By the end of the bout, he was punched out. Fists capsized, muscles shouting. Deeper down. He felt the comfort of a kiss"

Lightning crazed and cracked like an egg. High behind the garden shed. Painting myself as a normal American kid. I always hated it. High as high as high can loom. Under the sheets in my bedroom. I was high as high can get. Always afraid of those normal American kids. Oh, bongs and jams, and carpeted vans. Hate everything I don't understand. Hard times tightening the lid. I had to get away from those normal American kids. Always hated those normal American kids. Always hated those normal American kids"

one sunday morning (song for jane smiley's boyfriend),"This is how I tell it. Oh, but it's long. One Sunday morning. Oh, one son is gone. I can see where they're dawning. Over the sea. My father said what I had become. No-one should be. Outside I look lived in. Like the bones in a shrine. How am I forgiven?. Oh, I'll give it time. This, I learned without warning. Holding my brow. In time he thought I would kill him. Oh, but I didn't know how. I said it's your god I don't believe in. No, your Bible can't be true. Knocked down by the long life. He cried, 'I fear what waits for you'. I can hear those bells. Spoken and gone. I feel relief, I feel well. Now he knows he was wrong. I am cold for my father. Frozen underground. Jesus, I wouldn't bother. He belongs to me now. Something sad keeps moving. So I wandered around. I fell in love with the burden. Holding me down. Bless my mind, I miss. Being told how to live. What I learned without knowing. How much more that I owe that I can give. This is how I tell it. Oh, but it's long. One Sunday morning. One son is gone"

One wing will never ever fly dear. Nether yours nor mine. I fear we can only wave goodbye. *claudiobnu"

remember the mountain bed,"Do you still sing of the mountain bed we made of limbs and leaves?. Do you still sigh there near the sky where the holly berry bleeds?. You laughed as I covered you over with leaves. Face, breast, hips, and thighs. You smiled when I said the leaves were just the color of your eyes. Rosin smells and turpentine smells from eucalyptus and pine. Bitter tastes of twigs we chewed where tangled wood vines twine. Trees held us in on all four sides so thick we could not see. I could not see any wrong in you, and you saw none in me. Your arm was brown against the ground, your cheeks part of the sky. Your fingers played with grassy moss, as limber you did lie. Your stomach moved beneath your shirt and your knees were in the air. Your feet played games with mountain roots as you lay thinking there. Below us the trees grew clumps of trees, raised families of trees, and they. As proud as we tossed their heads in the wind and flung good seeds away. The sun was hot and the sun was bright down in the valley below. Where people starved and hungry for life so empty come and go. There in the shade and hid from the sun we freed our minds and learned. Our greatest reason for being here, our bodies moved and burned. There on our mountain bed of leaves we learned life's reason why. The people laugh and love and dream, they fight, they hate to die. The smell of your hair I know is still there, if most of our leaves are blown. Our words still ring in the brush and the trees where singing seeds are sown. Your shape and form is dim but plain, there on our mountain bed. I see my life was brightest where you laughed and laid your head.... I learned the reason why man must work and how to dream big dreams. To conquer time and space and fight the rivers and the seas. I stand here filled with my emptiness now and look at city and land. And I know why farms and cities are built by hot, warm, nervous hands. I crossed many states just to stand here now, my face all hot with tears. I crossed city, and valley, desert, and stream, to bring my body here. My history and future blaze bright in me and all my joy and pain. Go through my head on our mountain bed where I smell your hair again.. All this day long I linger here and on in through the night. My greeds, desires, my cravings, hopes, my dreams inside me fight:. My loneliness healed, my emptiness filled, I walk above all pain. Back to the breast of my woman and child to scatter my seeds again"
reservations,How can I convince you it's me I don't like. And not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes. When I've always been distant. and I've always told lies for love. I'm bound by these choices so hard to make. I'm bound by the feeling so easy to fake. None of this is real enough to take me from you. Oh I've got reservations. about so many things. but not about you. I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say. How can I get closer and be further away. From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie. I've got reservations. about so many things. but not about you. I've reservations. about so many things. but not about you. not about you. not about you. not about you. not about you.
rhythm,"When red is black and petals blue. And in my sleepless head our love's been dead a week or two. Sometimes good times are stuck inside of you. And then they're gone. But I don't know why. A lot of things have changed since you said goodbye. There are reasons for you to love me. But I gave you none. So I turn my glass and nod my chin. And wonder who you've been in rhythm with. Sometimes just time, cause can't escape. Clouds are playing close, not often too far away. Blue has no value, power over you. Open skies will grace your lip. Carelessness is what I miss. And that's how I think of you. Sometimes good times are all we have to do. So I turn my glass and nod my chin. And wonder who you've been in rhythm with. So I turn my glass and nod my chin. And wonder who you've been in rhythm with."
rising red lung,Solar rising red lung. Glisten under the sun. I wonder when it'll part. From the snow. The melody's a mistake. Embrace at the wake. How long does it take. For us to know?.

sexuality,"Sexuality. I've had relations with girls from many nations. I've made passes at women of all classes. And just because you're gay I won't turn you away. If you stick around I'm sure that we can find some common ground. Chorus:. Sexuality - Strong and warm and wild and free. Sexuality - Your laws do not apply to me. A nuclear submarine sinks off the coast of Sweden. Headlines give me headaches when I read them. I had an uncle who once played for Red Star Belgrade. He said some things are really best left unspoken. But I prefer it all to be out in the open. Sexuality - Strong and warm and wild and free. Sexuality - Your laws do not apply to me. Sexuality - Don't threaten me with misery. Sexuality - I demand equality. I'm sure that everybody knows how much my body hates me. It lets me down most every time and makes me rash and hasty. I feel a total jerk before your naked body of work. I'm getting weighed down with all this information. Safe sex doesn't mean no sex it just means use your imagination. Stop playing with yourselves in hard currency hotels. I look like Robert De Niro, I drive a Mitsubishi Zero. Sexuality - Strong and warm and wild and free. Sexuality - Your laws do not apply to me. Sexuality - Come eat and drink and sleep with me. Sexuality - We can be what we want to be."
shake it off,Sunlight angles on. A wooden floor at dawn. A ceiling fan is on. Chopping up my dreams. What is left of them. I take to sleep again. Where I dare pretend. I’m more than I seem. Tears get triggered. Yours remind me. Of the ice melting in my glass. Finally full again. So. I listen for. Your lips to break apart. Into words. It definitely starts to spoil my heart. Somewhere there’s a war. Sometimes there is art. It definitely starts to spoil my heart. Somewhere there’s a war. Sometimes there is art. When I’m awake enough. I’m gonna shake it off. Shake it off. Hotels hold me. Thoughts horizon. So many hearts. Beating in one place. Like a giant. Beast with many souls. No. Just a body. Full of holes. When I’m awake enough. I’m gonna shake it off. When I’m awake enough. I’m gonna shake it off. Shake it off
she's a jar,She's a jar. With a heavy lid. My pop quiz kid. A sleepy kisser. With feelings hid. She begs me not to miss her. She says forever. To light a fuse. We could use. A hand full of wheel. And a day off. And a bruised road. However you might feel. Tonight is real. When I forget how to talk I sing. Won't you please. Bring that flash to shine. And turn my eyes red. Unless they close. When you click. And my face gets sick. Stuck. Like a question unposed. Just climb aboard. The tracks of a train's arm. In my fragile family tree. And watch me floating inches above. The people under me. Please beware the quiet front yard. I warned you. Before there were water skies. I warned you not to drive. Dry your eyes you poor devil. Are there really ones like these. The ones I dream. Float like leaves. And freeze to spread skeleton wings. I passed through before I knew you. I believe it's just because. Daddy's payday is not enough. Oh I believe it's all because. Daddy's payday is not enough. Just climb aboard. The tracks of a train's arm. In my fragile family tree. And watch me floating inches above. The people under me. She's a jar. With a heavy lid. My pop quiz kid. A sleepy kisser. A pretty war. My feelings hid. She begs me not to hit her.

shrug and destroy,"Some harm for the past. Others dream of at last. Days continue. Multiply multitudes. I wonder who destroys. When no one is left, rejoice. All our statues, lullabies and rented rooms. Distances no one will go. For instances no one can know. I say good night. Leave the room unsatisfied. Like a child, I lie. Almost alone, not quite. Crowded avenues. Homeless in tennis shoes. Sometimes I wish to set free. The things that still matter to me. Days continue. Like a knife might intrude. I wonder who destroys. When nothing is left, rejoice. Nothing is left, rejoice"
side with the seeds,Tires type black. Where the blacktop cracks. Weeds spark through. Dark green enough to be blue. When the mysteries we believe in. Aren’t dreamed enough to be true.

The old buildings downtown. Empty so long ago. Windows broken and dreaming. So happy to leave what was my home. . With a sky blue sky. This rotten time. Wouldn’t seem so bad to me now. Oh, I didn’t die. I should be satisfied. I survived. That's good enough for now. . With a sky blue sky. This rotten time. Wouldn’t seem so bad to me now. Oh, if I didn’t die. I should be satisfied.

solitaire,"Once I thought the world was crazy. Everyone was sad and chasing. Happiness and love and. I was the only one above it.. Once I thought without a doubt. I had it all figured out. Universe with hands unseen. I was cold as gasoline.. Took too long, to think. I was wrong. To believe in me. Only.. Once my life was a game. So unfair. Beat me down and kept me there. Unaware of my naysayer. Solitaire was all I was. Playing. Took too long. To see. I was wrong. To believe in me. Only."

You wonder if these things matter and then. As soon you begin to wonder if these things matter. They cease to matter,. And caring is past.. And a fountain empties itself into the grass."
sonny feeling,"I was on my way home. From high school. Stuck at the crossing. I dug in for a duel. But at the last moment. I buried the brakes. My life split in two directions. Into two separate fates. I got on the last flight. To Amsterdam. But couldn’t hit the runway. So we took off again. “Aw, there’s no need to worry”. The captain cut in. “The winds are less angry. Over in Berlin”. You know it’s true. The other shoe. It waits for you. What can you do?. Remember to show gratitude. The darkest night is nothing new. Sonny’s got a problem. All the mini-mart clerks know. She knows nothing of Eminem’s. Suburban gangster flow. Oh maybe it’s random. How each moment unfolds. It didn’t feel like the wrong time or place. Until they cut off her clothes. A sunny feeling is taken away. A sunny feeling is taken away. A sunny feeling is taken away. A sunny feeling is taken away. I’m on my way home. From my high school. I’m always contemplating. Why the kids are still cruel. Oh. The kids are still cruel. A sunny feeling is taken away. A sunny feeling is taken away. A sunny feeling is taken away. Some of the feeling gets taken away"
spiders (kidsmoke),"Spiders are singing in the salty breeze. Spiders are filling out tax returns. Spinning out webs of deductions and melodies. On a private beach in Michigan. Why can't they wish their kisses good. Why do they miss when their kisses should. Fly like winging birds fighting for the keys. On a private beach in Michigan. This recent rash of kidsmoke. All these telescopic poems. It's good to be alone. Why can't they say what they want. Why can't they just say what they mean. Come clean, listen and talk. Hello private callers, IDs blocked. The sun will rise, we'll climb into cars. The future has a valley and a shortcut around. Who will wear the crown of drowning award. Hold a private light on a Michigan shore. You fool me with a kiss of kidsmoke. From a microscopic home. It's good to be alone. I'll be in my bed. You can be the stone. That raises from the dead. And carries us all home. There's no blood on my hands. I just do as I am told"

stetson kennedy,"I done spent my last three cents. Mailing my letter to the President. Didn't make a show, I didn't make a dent. So I'm swinging over to this independent gent. Stetson Kennedy. Writing his name in. Stetson Kennedy. Writing his name in. I can't win out to save my soul. Long as Smathers-Dupont's got me in the hole. Them war profit boys are squawking and balking. That's what's got me out here walking and talking. Knocking on doors and windows. Wake up and run down election morning. And scribble in Stetson Kennedy. <a href=""http://www.testimania.com/"">Testi Canzoni</a>. I ain't the world's best writer, ain't the world's best speller. But when I believe in something I'm the loudest yeller. If we fix it so you can't make no money on war. Well we'll all forget what we was killing folks for. We'll find us a peace job equal and free. We'll dump Smathers-Dupont in a salty sea. Well, this makes Stetson Kennedy the man for me"
summer teeth,"Like a cloud his fingers explode. On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows. His hearts in a bowl behind the bank. And every evening when he get home. To make his supper and eat it alone. His black shirt cries. While his shoes get cold. It's just a dream he keeps having. And it doesn't seem to mean anything. And it doesn't seem to mean anything. One summer, a suicide. Another autumn, a travelers guide. He hits snooze twice before he dies. And every evening when he get home. To make his supper and eat it alone. His black shirt cries. While his shoes get cold. It's just a dream he keeps having. And it doesn't seem to mean anything. It's just a dream he keeps having. He feels lucky to have you here. In his kitchen, in your chair. Sometimes he forgets that you're even there. It's just a dream he keeps having. And it doesn't seem to mean anything. It's just a dream he keeps having. It's just a dream. And it doesn't seem to mean anything."
sunken treasure,"There's rows and rows of houses, with windows painted blue.. With the light from the t.v. running parallel to you.. But there is no sunken treasure, rumored to be.. Wrapped inside my ribs in a sea black with ink.. I am so out of tune with you, I am so out of tune with you.. If I had a mountain, I'd try to fold it over.. If I had a boat, you know I'd probably roll over.. And I leave it on the shore, I'd leave it for somebody.. Surely there's somebody who needs it more than me.. I am so out of tune with you, I am so out of tune with you.. All the leaves will burn and autumn fires then return.. All the fires we burn, all will return.. Music is my savior, and I was maimed by rock and roll.. I was maimed by rock and roll.. I was tamed by rock and roll.. I got my name from rock and roll.."

taste the ceiling,I was only asking for a moment of the truth. I can't fight the feeling. when I'm hanging out with you. Why do I forgive you. Because I get confused. I could never leave behind the part of me. that you refuse. Ooh. I was on the ceiling I could almost feel the sun. Try the words in sequence. but that's never how it's done. Why do our disasters creep so slowly into view. I was only after a friend to follow through. I couldn't lose. I know why you don't really know me. I don't think you can call it home. All alone I couldn't taste another thing. I was on the ceiling and I swore it might be true. I could fight the feeling. but not quite as well as you. I don't know won't you come and show me. I don't think it's what you did before. All alone I couldn't take a case like you

You've been sleeping with somebody new. That's not the issue."
the boy done good,"The Boy Done Good. . Strange as it may seem, I once had my football dreams. But I was always the last one, the last to get chosen. When my classmates picked their teams. I guess that was the way it stayed in every game I played. Life just tripped me and clattered and kicked me. Till you picked me from the parade. Now I feel like I've won the cup every time that we. make love. Forty-five minutes each way, at halftime I hear a brass. band play. The boy done good, the girl done better,. The seasons turn and we're still together,. The sky is still blue and tomorrow is another day. You weren't that kind of a girl who likes her studs to. be covered in mud. Taking you to the pictures was a regular fixture. For one of life's eternal subs. I tried hard acting tough, but I just can't stand the. taste of that stuff. Like some macho park player I got in the way of. In some grudge match against his club. But I'm happier how I am today now I've put my. boots away. I guess I'll never get picked to play my song on Match. of the Day."

the joke explained,"I never held your gaze. I never know my place. I stare at the eyes staring at my face. It always ends in a tie. There is no knitting the divide. I cry at the joke explained. Ah but if I had known. If I had known. If I had known. I would have never believed. I never smoked my chain. Whoever measures the crest. Ah they can have my broken chest. It's a staring contest, in a hall of mirrors. I sweat tears but I don't ever cry. Ah but if I had known. If I had known. If I had known. I would have never believed. I never knelt at the news.

the lonely 1,"After the show you walked right past.. Arms reached out for your autograph.. And as you flashed your backstage pass.. I caught your eye with a camera's flash.. When the band came out they stood behind you.. Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue.. You stood alone in the halo's haze.. Shiny guitar hung on gold lamÃ©.. And you, you were the lonely one.. You were the lonely one.. When you perform it's so intense.. When the critics pan I write in your defense.. I understand I'm just a fan, I'm just a fan.. When I get home I turn off the alarm.. I've checked the phone, no messages on.. I play the ones from yesterday.. I play you're song just to hear you say that..... You, you're the lonely one.. You are the lonely one.. You, you're the lonely one.. You are the lonely one.."

They take it by stealing. And lying and gambling. And I take it my way. My shiny Black Bess. I treat horses good. And I'm friendly to strangers. I ride and your running. Makes my guns talk the best. And the rangers and deputies. Are hired by the rich man. To catch me and hang me. My shining black Bess. Yes, they'll catch me napping one day. And they'll kill me. And then I'll be gone. But that won't be my end. For my guns and my saddle. Will always be filled. By unwelcome travelers. And other brave men. And they'll take the money. And spread it out equal. Just like the Bible. And the prophets suggest. But men that go riding. To help these poor workers. The rich will cut down. Like an unwelcome guest"

via chicago,"I dreamed about killing you again last night. And it felt alright to me. Dying on the banks of Embarcadero skies. I sat and watched you bleed. Buried you alive in a fireworks display. Raining down on me. You cold, hot blood ran away from me. To the sea. I painted my name on the back of a leaf. And I watched it float away. The hope I had in a notebook full of white, dry pages. Was all I tried to save. But the wind blew me back via Chicago. In the middle of the night. And all without fight. At the crush of veils and starlight. I know I'll make it back. One of these days and turn on your TV. To watch a man with a face like mine. Being chased down a busy street. When he gets caught, I wont get up. And I wont go to sleep. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Via Chicago. Where the cups are cracked and hooked. Above the sink. They make me think. Crumbling ladder tears don't fall. They shine down your shoulders. And crawling is screw faster lash. I blow it with kisses. I rest my head on a pillowy star. And a cracked door moon. That says I havent gone too far. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Via Chicago. Searching for a home. Searching for a home. Searching for a home. Via Chicago. I'm coming home. I'm coming home."

You can find. Look at any clock telling time. Sing some strange verse. From some strange song of vines. And youll be where you want to be. I know I can't sing. Until she brings the song to life. And I blend with kings. Id never change a thing. Who knows anything. I don't know. There are so many things. I must leave alone. Some strange person is calling you their home. Can you be where you want to be?. Can you be. Where you want to be?. Can you be. Where you want to be?. Can you be. Where you want to be?.
where do i begin,Alright at least you cried. A point of pride has torn in two. What was we where we meets you. From where we end to where do I begin. We're so alone. We're never alone. Forever in debt to the stomach I get. When things can't be known. Our paths overgrown. From where we end to where do I begin. Why can't we tell when we're in hell. Why can't I say something to make you well. When things can't be seen confined within the dream. From where we end to where do I begin. From what was left behind to you're my friend. I won't ever ever ever fall apart like that again. From where we are to where do I begin
whole love,"My cold marigolds attack. My back, a bed of roses. I'm gonna bring my back. With [?]. And I know that I won't be. The easiest to set free. And I know that I won't been the last. Cold captain tied to the mast. I recall on the telephone. I recall when you get mad. I still love you to death. I won't ever forget how. And I know that I won't be. The easiest to set free. And I know that I won't been the last. Cold captain tied to the mast. I'm on the other side. I'm satisfied. Oh, I'm a spirit dove. I'm looking for your love. I'm simple as a matter of fact. Punch in the nose, don't over-react. But I'll still love you to death. And I won't ever forget how. And I know that I won't be. The easiest to set free. And I know that I won't been the last. Cold captain tied to the mast. And I know that I won't be the one. To secure that I know when it's wrong. But I hope when I know it's passed. And I hope I'll know when to show you my. Whole love [x8]. Ever forget how"

wilco (the song),"Are you under the impression. This isn't your life?. Do you dabble in depression?. Is someone twisting a knife in your back?. Are you being attacked?. Oh this is a fact that you need to know, oh, oh, oh, oh. Wilco, Wilco, Wilco will love you, baby. Are times getting tough?. Are the roads you travel rough?. Have you had enough of the old?. Tired of being exposed to the cold?. Stare at your stereo. Put on your headphones and pull out your hair, oh, oh, oh, oh. Colbert, Colbert, Colbert will love you, baby. So many wars that just can't be won, oh, oh, oh. Even before the battle's begun, oh, oh, oh. This is all of our arms open wide. Sonic shoulder for you to cry, y, y, y, y. Wilco, Wilco will love you, baby. Is someone twisting a knife in your back?. Are you being attacked?. Oh this is a fact that you need to know. Wilco, Wilco, Wilco, Wilco, Wilco will love you, baby. *claudiobnu"
wishful thinking,Fill up your mind with all it can know. Don't forget that your body will let it all go. Fill up your mind with all it can know. What would we be without wishful thinking. Chambers of chains. With red plastic mouths. The inside of outside. No one has found. How to unring the bell. It's just as well. The turntable sizzles. Casting the spells. The pressure devices. Hell in a nutshell. Is any song worth singing. If it doesn't help. Fill up your mind with all it can know. Don't forget that your body will let it all go. Fill up your mind with all it can know. 'Cause what would love be without wishful thinking. Open your arms as far as they will go. We take off your dress. An embarrassing poem. Was written when I was alone. In love with you. I shook down those lines. To shine up the streets. I got up off my hands and knees. To thank my lucky stars that you're not me. What would we be without wishful thinking. What would we be without wishful thinking. What would we be without wishful thinking
won't let you down,Theress no one to guide you. Anyone can feel like this. There's no one beside you. I put a kiss upon your lips. Our love might let you down. But I want you to remember this. No one outshines you. And only one can feel like this. There's no one inside you. You're the one that I still miss. Our love could let you down. Remember that you told me this. When the fog has twisted. And all the sands have drifted. There is one thing to remember. You're not gone. If you're feeling older. The weight will lift from your shoulders. There is one thing to remember. I'm not gone. I'm gonna find you. Put a kiss upon your lips. No one outshines you. And I want you to remember this. Love won't let you down. If you can remember this. When the fog has twisted. And all the sands have lifted. There'll be one thing to remember. I'm not gone. When you're getting older. The weight will lift from your shoulders. There'll be one thing to remember. You're not gone. I won't ever let you down. I won't ever let you down. I won't ever let you down. I'm gonna find you. I want you wrapped around my kiss. Love won't let you down. There's one thing to remember this. When the fog is twisted. And all the sands have lifted. There is one thing to remember. You're not gone. When you're getting older. And the weight will lift from your shoulders. There's one thing to remember. I'm not gone. I won't ever let you down. I won't ever let you down. I won't ever let you down. I won't ever let you down. I promise. I won't ever let you down. I won't ever let you down. I promise. I won't ever let you down. I promise. I won't ever let you down.
woodgrain,"I'm not a poet. And I know it. There is no deep secret. Tossing inside me. I have no timing. I can't form my feelings. Sometimes I rhyme. Sometimes I don't. So go ahead, take a look at my kitchen. Take a look at the woodgrain there. What's it for? That hardwood floor. Is where I'm walkin' and thinkin'. Walkin' and thinkin'. About you"
you and i,"You and I. We might be strangers. How ever close we get sometimes. Its like we never met. But you and I. I think we can take it. All the good with the bad. Make something that no one else has, But. You and I. You and I. Me and You. What can we do. When the words we use. sometimes are misconstrued. Well I won't guess. Whats coming next. I can't ever tell you. The deepest well. I've ever fallen into. Oh I don't wanna know. Oh I don't wanna know. Oh I don't need to know. Everything about you. Oh I don't wanna know. And you don't need to know. That much about me. You and I. We might be strangers. How ever close we get sometimes. Its like we never met. But you and I. I think we can take it. All the good with the bad. Make something that no one else has, But. You and I. You and I. You and I. You and I. You and I. You and I"
you are my face,I remember my mother’s. Sister’s husband’s brother. Working in the goldmine full-time. Filling in for sunshine. Filing into tight lines. Of ordinary beehives. The door screams I hate you. Hate you hanging around my blue jeans. Why is there no breeze. No currency of leaves. No current through the water wire. No feelings I can see. I trust no emotion. I believe in locomotion. But I've turned to rust as we've discussed. Though I must have let you down. too many times. In the dirt and the dust. I have no idea how this happens. All of my maps have been overthrown. Happenstance has changed my plans. So many times my heart has been outgrown. Now everybody’s feeling all alone. Can’t tell you who I am. When everybody’s feeling all alone. Can’t tell you who I am. I am looking forward. Toward the shadows tracing bones. Our faces stitched and sewing. Our houses hemmed into homes. Trying to be thankful. Our stories fit into phones. And our voices lift so easily. A gift given accidentally. When we’re not sure. We’re not alone
you never know,"Come on children. You're acting like children. Every generation thinks. its the end of the world. And all ya fat followers. Get fit fast. Every generation thinks it's the last. thinks its the end of the world. Yes dream down a well. There's a lone heavy hell. I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore. It's a feeling we transcend. We're here at the end. I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore. You never know. Come on kids. You're acting like children. Act your age. Put back the black metals and pearls. All ya sword-swallowers pull yourselves together. Every generation thinks its the worst. Thinks it's the end of the world. It's a secret I can't tell. There's a wish down a well. I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore. It's a long heavy hell. Super-size it by 10. I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore. You never know. You never know. It's a dear to transcend. Everyone here, at the end. I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore. You never know. *claudiobnu"
you satellite,"Somehow. A satellite. Can of light. Looks so red. Unbottle the halo. A satellite. Can chains change any failure when all along. Someone can change it. Follow on. Sometimes I don't hate it lately. What I don't know I'm gonna bleed it away. Reunite. The dynamite. Catch it all and reunite. Dynamite how high. I'm more moved by the maybe, it's ok. You can't sing what you can't give away. I've come all this way to hold your hand. I became a calendar while I was waiting. I - I won't live any what you can't give it away. I - I won't miss any what I'm giving away. Don't want to go and I don't want to stay. You satellite (x3)"
