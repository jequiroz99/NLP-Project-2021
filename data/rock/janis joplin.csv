Ooh, ooh.. I get drunk and I laugh a lot,. There's something that I hear.. My brain gets loose, my soul gets hot,. The music hits my ears.. I hear the music.... Lord, it sounds so sweet!. Music's hot and I don't mind. If I dance a step or two.. I do a twitch, unwind my spine. I set my eyes on you.. I watch you move, you move so fine,. So fine I never knew. Making love while dancing.
