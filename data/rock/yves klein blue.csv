19,"You are my sun, and you brought light into my world,. Dragged me from waters where I’d become submerged.. Before I could sing, but my words came out cracked and broke.. When I say I love you it never means enough.. When I think about all of those nights,. All of those songs how they all fall apart -. When I think every single time,. How those words of ours never lost out –. Then I was the sun, and my light broke over the world.. My breath was a song and my fingers strummed the chords.. But that’s all a show, at your whim I’m as weak as a child,. I guess the things that make you happy are the only things that make you cry-. When I think about all of those nights,. All of those songs, how they all fell apart -. When I think every single time. How those words of ours, oh they never lost out –. (understated melodic piano solo). I am your son, and you brought me into the world.. I am a child still but man enough to leave home –. And I’d love to stay, but now I’ve got a baby that’s mine. I guess there’s too many questions and never enough time…. There’s never enough time."
blasphemy,"Oh, I believe in something else –. There’s no name for it in spite of men more clever than I.. Wistful men of scripture wander the earth. ‘Cos of their faith they’re born to die,. Or else are not pious…. Seems a long time just to be waiting to live my life! I say –. It’s so much better each time.. I feel like I could die.. I feel like everything’s fine.. It only happens of course,. When I run onto their swords.. I’m never knowing quite why, but I…. I believe in something else.. Oh, I believe in science being a window. We look out of but never back inside.. And I believe that weeks and streets cheat the feet. of anyone that tries to run beside -. But never you mind!. Falling behind is where I found the best of life! I say,. It’s so much better each time.. I feel like I could die.. Oh, I feel like everything’s fine.. It only happens of course,. When I run onto their swords,. I’m never knowing quite why, but I…. Yes, I believe in something else.. (watch me now…). Children of a different design all march to different drums. But they’re all marching in time!. That’s a funny coincidence; that’s funny don’t you think that they’d realise?. And masses singing songs for a child,. But the melodies wild and they’re all out of time!. Some who sing, well they hardly start –. They sing with half a heart and in doing so they lie.. But I’m not the one to decide, who’s pulling the wool over your eyes;. ‘Cos I’ve only lived behind my own eyes,. And if I told you different it’d just be a lie. I say…. Each man believes it’s his right,. To show the others the light -. But a minds’ limit’s a life.. Each in each others exile,. And guiltier than those they try.. Oh it’s no small wonder that I, yes I …. I believe in something else."
not what i want,"There’s a fork in every road,. Where you see what’s required and find you admire it -. Or, else you’re not that way minded…it makes no sense to persevere.. And though it may be inaccurate, well…. on the facts of the matter I’d suspect it’s the latter.. There’s only one thing that matters -. It just to sever the necks of self important clever dicks.. “That’s just not what I wanna do! That’s not what I want at all!”. Oh there’s a part of me somewhere,. That thinks that I could have some without giving it all away.. If I turn out sad and lonely, you’ll know I got it all wrong -. But as long as this wish and the world coexist I’ll go on.. The institution requires,. That every mind can be just what it desires and that,. Every mind will desire much the same thing.. And to use the vernacular –. Well I’ve had a fair crack and I’m thoroughly shat!. I guess there’s only one course of action…. It’s just to sever the necks of self important clever dicks.. “That’s just not what I wanna do! That’s not what I want at all!”. My friend, I knew you so well once –. How did they let you forget that you’re not like the rest of them?. And they’ll say the same thing about me, oh but –. They’re assholes! What would they know?. They won’t be grinning when they see how far we can go –. So lets give them a show!. We’ll go on…(ex-cet-er-a). (cheesy key change…you know you love it.). “That’s just not what I wanna do! That’s not what I want at all!”. Oh there’s a place for us out there –. Where we can have it all without selling our souls!. And just as long as we all pretend that’s true -. That’s enough for me to go on,. ‘Cos I got a feeling it’s gonna pay off before long-. So come on, come on."
polka,"“Brother hold your head this way,. and bustle to the front of the line;. ‘cos if they catch your eyes before you get inside. Well, you’ll never be allowed.”. People got a name for us. ‘cos we escape the strain of the days. Oh we stretch at the sides and bend in the middle. But we never ever break.. But if you’re feeling that way now,.

Or your name or even your face -. Lick up a dream that seemingly sings with rushing neon death."
silence is distance,"Silence is distance words are lonely there’s miles between your skin and mine,. But when sin is just words, in your silence there’s no crime..

Then there’s nowhere you can’t hide,. But stay with me honey though it’s safer inside.. You looked so funny when you told me: the rumour strikes the heart of the lie.. And I could taste it on the air, I could feel it on my spine.. Oh and even though I drives me wild I couldn’t blame you for having it straight in your mind:. That two wrongs make a right,. For using it as an excuse every time.. But have you saved all your money? You could leave this town tonight..

the streetlight,"Lovely and loveless,. And lonely as the moon.. She sits at the bar that clips her wings,. And slips through the cracks of the room.. The rest are all preoccupied,. Just talking about this and that -. But just around the corner, sit right down,. ‘Cos everything’s gonna be grand.. Oh a streetlight shines the brightest before morning,. Then fades away as the dawn becomes noon.. Oh and while all your trying’s fine,. Your light is tinny and slight,. The sun’s gonna rise and make a fool of you!. I’m sure you were a star once,. But now you’re just a worthless as me!. But when you’ve been made up all of your life,. Is there anything that’s underneath?. And maybe I’m the shallow one,. But I’ve got no reason to be fair -. So just around the corner, sit right down,. ‘Cos everyone’s hanging out there.. So lovely and loveless,. I guess the story is true:. That you can kiss the boys and make ‘em cry. But there’s always someone meaner than you!. And the rest would not abstain from you. If you hadn’t treated them so bad -. But just around the corner, sit right down,. ‘Cos everythings’s gonna be grand.. Oh and everyone’s gonna be glad.. Everything’s gonna be…"
