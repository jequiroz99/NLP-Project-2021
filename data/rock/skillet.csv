This is how it feels when you finally fight back. When life pushes me I push harder. What doesn't kill me makes me stronger. (The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye. And then I heard you flat line). No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna stand and fight forever. (Don't close your eyes). No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna fight for us together.

Sound off, this is the call, tonight, we rise!. Rise. Tonight, we rise. Rise. Tonight, we rise!. Like a hand grenade. Thrown in a hurricane. Spinning in chaos. Trying to escape the flame. Yesterday is gone!. Faster than the blast of a car bomb!. And when the scars heal. The pain passes. As hope burns, we rise from the ashes!. Darkness fades away!. And a light shines on a brave new day!. Our future's here and now. Here comes the countdown!. [Chorus]. Sound it off, this is the call!. Rise and revolution!. It's our time to change it all. Rise and revolution!. Unite and fight, to make a better life!. Everybody one for all. Sound off, this is the call, tonight, we rise!. Rise. Tonight, we rise. Rise. Tonight, we rise!.

how deep the fathers love for us,"How deep the Father's love for us. How vast beyond all measure. That He should give His only Son. To make a wretch His treasure. How great the pain of searing loss,. The Father turns His face away. As wounds which mar the chosen One. Bring many sons to glory. Behold the Man upon a cross,. My sin upon His shoulders. Ashamed I hear my barking voice. Call out among the scoffers. It was my sin that held Him there. Until it was accomplished. His dying breath has brought me life. I know that it is finished. I will not boast in anything. No gifts, no power, no wisdom. But I will boast in Jesus Christ. His death and resurrection. Why should I gain from His reward?. I cannot give an answer. But this I know with all my heart. His wounds have paid my ransom. (repeat)"

looking for angels,"Going through this life looking for angels. People passing by looking for angels. Walk this world alone try to stay on my feet. Sometimes crawl, fall, but I stand up. Cause I'm afraid to sleep. And open my eyes to a new day. With all new problems 4. and all new pain. All the faces are filled with so much anger. Losing our dignity and hope from fear of danger. After all the wars, after settling the scores. At the break of dawn we will be deaf to the answers. There's so much bigotry, misunderstanding and fear. With eyes squinted and fists clinched. We reach out for what is dear. We want it we want. We want a reason to live. We're on a pilgrimage. A crusade for hope. Cause in our hearts and minds and souls we know. We need it we need. We need more than this. Going through this life looking for angels. People passing by looking for angels. Walking down the streets looking for angels. Everyone I meet looking for angels. So many nations with so many hungry people. So many homeless scrounging around for dirty needles. On the rise, teen suicide, when we will realize. We've been desensitized by the lies of the world. We're oppressed and impressed by the greedy. Whose hands squeeze the life out of the needy. When will we learn that wars, threats. And regrets are the cause and effect of living in fear. Who can help protect the innocence of our children. Stolen on the internet with images they can't forget. We want it we want. We want a reason to live. We represent a generation. That wants to turn back a nation. To let love be our light and salvation. We need it we need. We need more than this. I became a savior to some kids. I'll never meet. Sent a check in the mail to buy them. Something to eat. What will you do to make a difference. To make a change?. What will you do to help someone along the way?. Just a touch, a smile as you turn the other cheek. Pray for your enemies, humble yourself. Love's staring back at me. In the midst of the most painful faces. Angels show up in the strangest of places"

more faithful,"All the things my feet thought to be firm. Are falling with urgency. Tearing back my false sense of security. Some say things change, nothing stays the same. But the sweetness in my ears. Safe in your arms speak the words I love to hear. You have been more faithful than the morning sun. You have been more faithful than knowing the night will come. You have been more faithful than the changing of seasons. All things I thought that I used to know. Are falling down again. Our disillusionment is how we grow. Some say things change, nothing stays the same. In a world of inconsistency. When everything's a lie,. What can cause my heart to believe. You have been more faithful than the morning sun. You have been more faithful than knowing the night will come. You have been more faithful than the changing of seasons. You have been more faithful than the morning sun. You have been more faithful than knowing the night will come. You have been more faithful than the morning sun. You have been more faithful than knowing the night will come. You have been more faithful than the changing of seasons."

My head was bleeding so red. But all the thorns in my crown, the rose blended. Instead with my beautiful robe carries on, I'll carry on. I cut down a tree said, Man would you look at me. I stuck my head in a thorn bush Man I was deceived. Oh my brother, Your hands are full of sores. But God blessed you brother,. My nails are longer than yours. I was crucified with Christ. But how come IÃ¢m not dead. God gave me a cross. But I made my own instead. My beautiful carries on, IÃ¢ll carry on. I cut down the tree,. I nailed myself to the wood. I screamed in agony,. Cause the glory wasnÃ¢t so good. I fell to my knees and I remember. The words of God pierced so hard,. Your righteousness is like filthy rags. And I fell to my knees and said, My filthy robe."

not gonna die,"Intro. Death surrounds. My heartbeat's slowing down. I won't take this world's abuse. I won't give up, I refuse. This is how it feels when you're bent and broken. This is how it feels when your dignity's stolen. When everything you love is leaving. You hold on to what you believe in. (The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye. And then I heard you flat line). No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna stand and fight forever. (Don't close your eyes). No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna fight for us together. No, we're not gonna die tonight. Break their hold. 'Cause I won't be controlled. They can't keep their chains on me. When the truth has set me free. This is how it feels when you take your life back. This is how it feels when you finally fight back. When life pushes me I push harder. What doesn't kill me makes me stronger. (The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye. And then I heard you flat line). No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna stand and fight forever. (Don't close your eyes). No, not gonna die tonight. We're gonna fight for us together.

How could you, how could you, how could you love me?. When all you ever gave me were open wounds?. Downstairs the enemy sleeps. Leaving the TV on. Watching all the dreams we had turn into static. Doesn't matter what I do. Nothing's gonna change. I'm never good enough. And you can't stop me from falling apart. 'Cause my self-destruction is all your fault. (Chorus). Tell me why you broke me down and betrayed my trust in you. I'm not giving up, giving in when will this war end?. When will it end???. You can't stop me from falling apart (3X).

I've been stabbed in the back, the bleeding won't stop. Just another cut in the dark. Oh, can you see me?. Oh, can you hear me?. Can you hear me screaming for you?. I'm afraid I'm gonna die out here. I can't save, I can't save myself. Get me out, get me out of Hell. I'm suffocating waiting for you. Cause the angels don't fly down here. I need you because no one else.

We turn this ground for hunger. Why did we take that bite?. Paint me with an endless sunrise, Paint me. Paint me open eyes, Paint me with the color of love. You took a walk on the planet. You gave us shad and light. You create mood and substance. How can I can take a bite?. Paint me with an endless sunrise, Paint me. Paint me open eyes, Paint me with the color of love. Paint me, mark me up,. In these frail, dot-to-dot lines. Color me from one red stream. From which all others flow. Take my black and white and yellow. Brown and pink and pain and sorrow. Take my black and white and yellow. Brown and pink and hate and sorrow. Paint me with an endless sunrise, Paint me. Paint me open eyes, Paint me with the color of love."

Falling at Your feet I kneel perpetually. Staring at my jar I proceed to pour it out. The loss and gain goes on and on and on. You're in the blood and you're all around. Beauty speaks without a sound. Raging flood, YouÃ­re the peace I need. Down, pour down. All my fears and needs I put in my jar. I'd give everything to know who You are. The open space around Your feet. Becomes my resting place, my destiny. The loss and gain goes on and on and on. You're in the blood and you're all around. Beauty speaks without a sound. Raging flood, YouÃ­re the peace I need. Down, pour down (repeat). And all You're, is all I need. You're all I need. A moment of intimacy my life explained and unpronounced. Falling at Your feet I kneel perpetually. Staring at my jar I proceed to pour it out. The loss and gain goes on and on and on. You're in the blood and you're all around. Beauty speaks without a sound. Raging flood, You're the peace I need. Down, pour down (repeat). You're in my blood, in my blood. All You are, is all I need, is all I need."

saviors of the world,"[Verse 1]. Streets filled with blood, black and red. Dreams and hearts that once knew love are cold and dead. [Pre-Chorus 1]. Breathing rust, it's come to this. We burnt to dust, an apocalypse. But we could live again if we can find ourselves. [Chorus]. We are the saviors of the world. And I will not be ruled. We are kings and conquerors. And I won't bow to you. They will not control us anymore. We will not conform, no, anymore. We are the saviors, the saviors. The saviors of the world. [Verse 2]. Cities will burn, the end is come. Paradise is lost, we wonder what we've done. [Pre-Chorus 2]. Riches rust. The iron fist crashes down on the powerless. But hope could live again if we can find ourselves. [Chorus]. We are the saviors of the world. And I will not be ruled. We are kings and conquerors. And I won't bow to you. They will not control us anymore. We will not conform, no, anymore. We are the saviors, the saviors. The saviors of the world. [Chorus]. We are the saviors of the world. And I will not be ruled. We are kings and conquerors. And I won't bow to you. They will not control us anymore. We will not conform, no, anymore. We are the saviors, the saviors. The saviors of the world"
say goodbye,"Things are changing. It seems strange and. I need to figure this out. You’ve got your life. I got mine. But you’re all I cared about. Yesterday we were laughing. Today I’m left here asking. Where has all the time gone now. I’m left alone somehow. Growing up and getting older. I don’t want to believe it’s over. Don’t say goodbye. Cause I don’t wanna hear those words tonight. Cause maybe it’s not the end for you and I. And although we knew. This time would come for me and you. Don’t say anything tonight. If you’re gonna say goodbye. Do you remember. In December. How we swore we’d never change. Even though you’re leaving. That our feelings. Would always stay the same. I wish we could be laughing. Instead I’m standing here asking. Do we have to end this now. Can we make it last somehow. We both know what we’ve gotta say, not today. Cause I don’t wanna leave this way. And if it’s over. It hurts but I’m giving you my word. I hope that you’re always. Happy like we were. Happy like we were. Yesterday we were laughing (if you're gonna say goodbye). Today i'm left here asking(if you're gonna say goodbye). And although we knew this time would come for me and you. Don't say anything tonight. If you're gonna say goodbye"
say it loud,"Can't help but speak of what I've seen and heard. I understand just what the purpose is. Uncover peace; uncover hope for all to see. And I can't keep quiet, gotta shout it out to You. Chorus:. Gotta say it loud. Gotta say it loud. Gotta say it loud. Gotta shout it out. (repeat). Come right away to find the joy I've found. Don't hesitate to give up everything. Discover peace; discover hope, meaning of life. I've got to say it, gotta shout it out to You. CHORUS(repeat). Can't keep it, keep it all to myself. Can't hold it, can't hold it down. Can't shut it, can't shut it out. Can't keep me silent. CHORUS(repeat)."
scarecrow,"Hanging on this post. In my dirty clothes. Try to concentrate on You. But I keep forgetting. Safe enough to not let go. Scared enough to not release. Open up to drink the wind. You tear me up when you come in. Take me down, shake me out. Give me a brain, that I might know You better. Take me down, shake me out. Give me a brain, that I might know You better. Hanging in the sun. Waiting for the rain. Saw a field catch on fire. I caught myself just watching. Safe enough to not let go. Scared enough to not release. Open up to drink the wind. You tear me up when you come in. Take me down, shake me out. Give me a heart, that I might love You better. Take me down, shake me out. Give me a heart, that I might love You better. Hanging on a post. Just next to Yours. I want to curse and spit. I weep aloud at Your mercy. Take me down, shake me out. Give me a life, that I might serve You better. Take me down, shake me out. Give me a life, that I might serve You better."
should've when you could've,"I'm done wondering where you've been. All night long when you're out with your friends. All you say, that the matter's over. But now that chapter's over. I'm done trusting you it's ended. Even after I catch you red handed. You could've been my only one. But now your chance is gone. [Chorus]. You should've when you could've. You're gonna miss my love girl. You should, it would've been so good. You should've when I would've. Now I know I've had enough. Better luck next time girl. You should, it would've been so good. I'm done chasing you all over. May as well be chasing after thunder. Play hard to get if it makes you happy. For a change now you can start chasing me. Don't cry cause I ain't your sure thing. It ain't my fault you don't know a good thing. You could've been my only one. But now your chance is gone. [Bridge]. Don't you understand. Don't wanna be your backup plan. Now I won't be here to clean up when it hits the fan. You tried to keep me on your leash. It's time you started chasing me"

Pulled into suspension in the middle of You. Let what was hidden be reveal. Walls of fear broken wide. Infinite Jesus spread all in You. Towering over the horizons. Gushing with surrender in Your hands. Now You pull me apart. I'm suspended in You. Stretch me bigger. Reveal Yourself to be. The frame that holds me tightly in center. Pulled into suspension in the middle of You.

the older i get,"The walls between. You and I. Always pushing us apart nothing left but scars fight after fight. The space between. Our calm and rage.

It's been way too long for the times we missed. I didn't know then it would hurt like this but I think. The older I get. Maybe I'll get over it. It's been way too long for the times we missed. I can't believe it still hurts like this. The time between. Those cutting words. Built up our defenses never made no sense it just made me hurt. Do you believe. That time heals all wounds. It started getting better but it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you. What was I waiting for. I should've taken less and given you more. I should've weathered the storm. I need to say so bad. What were you waiting for. This could have been the best we ever had. I'm just getting older. I'm not getting over you I'm trying to. I wish it didn't hurt like this. It's been way too long for the times we missed. I can't believe it still hurts like this"

It's our resistance, you can't resist us. Hey can you hear me? Hey, are you listening?. Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history. Walk through the fire, walk on the water.

those nights,I remember when. We used to laugh. About nothing at all. It was better than going mad. From trying to solve all the problems we're going through. Forget 'em all. Cause on those nights we would stand and never fall. Together we faced it all. Remember when we'd. Stay up late and we'd talk all night. In a dark room lit by the tv light. Through all the hard times in my life. Those nights kept me alive. We'd listen to the radio play all night. Didn't want to go home to another fight. Through all the hard times in my life. Those nights kept me alive. I remember when. We used to drive. Anywhere but here. As long as we'd forget our lives. We were so young and confused that we didn't know. To laugh or cry. Those nights were ours. They will live and never die. Together we'd stand forever. Remember when we'd. Those nights belong to us. There's nothing wrong with us. I remember when. We used to laugh. And now I wish those nights were last

(time to spread my wings and fly). Watching for comets, will I see you again?. (time to fly away so high). You burn so bright,. You burn me up tonight"

whirlwind,"Talking to God. Hearing what he wants. He moves in violence. I stand in silence. Who can question You, who can fathom You?. In your presence, who can stand?. Worlds spin around and kings crumble down. There's no escape what YouÃ­ve planned. Winds approaching, clouds are forming. God in his power. Is swirling around me. Calling me, and you know my name. So jump in or be taken, yea I can't. Run long enough, or go far enough. To escape the screaming rain. It's alright. It's alright. Jump in the whirlwind. I'm letting go (repeat). My world's at stake. I want to break. Stop the striving. Start the dying. I'm thrown into it. It's so imminent. There's no arguing what You say. I gotta keep fanning it, I keep fanning it. I keep fanning the fire to flames. It's alright. It's alright. Jump in the whirlwind. I'm letting go (repeat twice). Master and Savior, Sustainer and Creator. You move in power. And winds and thunder. It's alright. It's alright. Jump in the whirlwind. Letting go. Letting go - I'm letting go."

A burning, consuming fire. No. You'll never be alone. When darkness comes I'll light the night with stars. Hear my whispers in the dark. No. You'll never be alone. When darkness comes. you know I'm never far. Hear my whispers in the dark. You feel so lonely and ragged. You lay here broken and naked. My love is. Just waiting. To clothe you in crimson roses. I will be the one that's gonna find you. I will be the one that's gonna guide you. My love is. A burning, consuming fire"

yours to hold,I see you standing here. But you’re so far away. Starving for your attention. You don’t even know my name. You’re going through so much. But I know that I could be the one to hold you. Every single day. I find it hard to say. I could be yours alone. You will see someday. That all along the way. I was yours to hold. I was yours to hold. I see you walking by. Your hair always hiding your face. I wonder why you’ve been hurting. I wish I had some way to say. You’re going through so much. Don’t you know that I will be the one to hold you. I’m stretching but you’re just out of reach. You should know. I’m ready when you’re ready for me. And I’m waiting for the right time. For the day I catch your eye. To let you know. That I’m yours to hold. I'm stretching but you're just out of reach. I'm ready when you're ready for me
