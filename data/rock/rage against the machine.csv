the ghost of tom joad,"Man walks along the railroad track. He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back. The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge. Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge. The shelter line stretchin' around the corner. Welcome to the New World Order. Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest. No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!. And The highway is alive tonight. Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes. I'm sitting down here in the campfire light. Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad. He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag. The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag. He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last. In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass. With a one way ticket to the promised land. With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand. Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock. Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts. And The highway is alive tonight. Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes. I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light. With the Ghost of old Tom Joad. Guitar Solo. Now Tom Said; ""Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy. Wherever a hungry new born baby cries. Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air. Look for me ma'. I'll be there. Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand. For a decent job or a helpin' hand. Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free. Look in their eyes ma,. You'll see me! (repeat 8 times). And the highway is alive tonight. nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes.

maria,"Tha sun ablaze as Maria's foot. Touches tha surface of sand. On northern land. As human contraband. some rico from Jalisco. Passed her name to tha boss. She stuffed ten to a truckbed. She clutches her cross. Here comes tha exhaust. And it rips through her lungs. She's off fast to pasture. Like cattle she'll cross. Degree 106. Sweat and vomit are thrown. And she prays and suffocates. Upon tha memories of home. Of yanqui guns for blood debts on tha loans. Of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones. Of granes hidden trapped up in visions of war. Of nothing no one nobody no more. These are her mountains and skies. And she radiates. And through history's rivers of blood. She regenerates. And like tha sun dissapears only to reappear. She's eternally here. Her time is near. Never conquered but there. To tear away at tha mask. And now she got a quota. Tha needle and thread crucifixion. Sold and shipped across tha new line. of Mason Dicon. Rippin' through denim. Tha point an inch from her vein. Tha foreman approach. His steps now pound in her brain. His presence it terrifies. And eclipses her days. No minutes to rest. No moment to pray. And with a whisper. He wips her. Her soul chained to his will. ""My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"". Her arms jerks. Tha sisters gather round her and scream. As if in a dream. Eyes on tha crimson stream. Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to tha floor. Of nothing no one nobody no more. These are her mountains an skies. And she radiates. And through history's rivers of blood. She regenerates. And like tha sun dissapears only to reappear. Maria she's eternally here. Her time is near. Never conquered but here."

ashes in the fall,A mass of hands press on the market window. Ghosts of progress. Dressed in slow death. Feeding on hunger. And glaring through the promise. Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle. A mass of nameless at the oasis. That hides the graves beneath the master's hill. Are buried for drinking. The river's water. While shackled to the line. At the empty well. This is the new sound. Just like the old sound. Just like the noose wound. Over the new ground. Listen to the fascist sing. 'Take hope here. War is elsewhere. You were chosen. This is god's land. Soon we'll be free. Of blot and mixture. Seeds planted by our. Forefather's hand'. A mass of promises. Begin to rupture. Like the pockets. Of the new world kings. Like swollen stomachs. In Appalachia. It's the priests that f**k you. As they whisper holy things. A mass of tears have transformed to stones now. Sharpened on suffering. And woven into slings. Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress. Taking today what tomorrow never brings. This is the new sound. Just like the old sound. Just like the noose wound. Over the new ground. Ain't it funny how the factory doors close. Round the time that the school doors close. Round the time that the doors of the jail cells. Open up to greet you like the reaper.

'Cause more is necessary than vocabulary war,. 'Cause the toxic rock (crack) import's hitting on your door.. CIA, I'll see you later 'cause your time is coming soon.. I flip this shit like Pacino and it's your dog day afternoon.. Attica, Attica, drug agents you bring your static-a.. My alphabet will slash and then can flip you automatic-a,. Dramatic like Ali-Shaheed Mohammed* brought the vibes.. I bring the sun at red dawn upon the thoughts of Franz Fanon.. So stand at attention devil ???,. You'll never survive choosing sides against the Wretched of the Earth (Fanon's book).. The infiltrator,. ??? intoxicator,. People incarcerator,. Liberation movement annihilator.. We got you clocked pushing rocks and it fell.. We got brothers trooping subways like the Ho Chi Minh trail.. We got the truth addict, Last Emperor, KRS and history manifested.. Tomorrow tha next lesson.. You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that.. You know the cops, they got a network for the toxic rock.. You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that .. So get that flashlight outta my face.. You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that.. The Last Emperor, KRS-One & Big Zack.. As free-market capitalism and technology expands,. The third world's fertile soil becomes a desert wasteland.. So it takes ??? to demand the government provide answers,. When Lady Liberty has me bewitched like Samantha,. And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer.. To all my black magik romancers and acid rain dancers,. Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza.. We fear no man and throw jams that attack counter-intelligence programs.. Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan,. I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians.. Now what hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us?. I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to zealots.. I saw an iron curtain called hip-hop and got it open like Boris Yeltsen.. Whirlwind tornadoes in the rain forest if you say so.. KRS and the Last Emperor war like the Green Hornet and Kato.. Zack de la Rocha brings the enraged flow.. But all three drop science and become the most powerful alliance since NATO.. Need I say the CIA be criminals in action,. Cocaine crack-unpacking, high surveillance-tracking.. Prominent blacks and whites giving orders for mass slaughters.. I want all my daughters to be like Maxine Waters.. When they flooded the streets with crack cocaine I was like Noah,. Now they ???? 'cause the whole Cold War is over.. Communism fell to the dollars you were grabbing.. All the assault and battering in the name of intelligence-gathering. Now it's karma you're battling--a losing fight.. I choose the mic to recite, ignite light in the night, aight.. We should beat em, President Clinton should delete 'em.. It's not hard, the CIA simply has no more job.. Oh my goddess, mother, you can fix this.. We rock over mixes, not 666s.. Yo, this is the message to all that can hear it.. If you got secret information now's the time to share it.. Call your congresswoman, your senator, your Mayor.. It's time for all the scholars to unite with all the playas.. Rearrange and see, times is definitely changing, G.. They used to tap the phone now they tapping while you paging me. It's crazy B. yet it's plain to see who's the enemy. Who's left?. The NRA, the ATF, the AMA? OK, OK, it's all irrelevant. 'Cause in the new millennium there'll be no central intelligence."
calm like a bomb,"Feel the funk blast. I be walkin' god like a dog. My narrative: fearless. My word war returns to burn. Like Baldwin home from Paris.. Like Steel from a furnace. I was born landless.... It's the native son. Born of Zapata's guns.. Stroll through the shanties. And the cities remains.. Same bodies buried hungry,. But with different last names.. These vultures rob everything;. Leave nothing but chains.. They Pick a point on the globe,. Yes the pictures the same!. There's a bank, there's a church, a myth and a hearse,. A mall and a loan, a child dead at birth.. There's a widow pig parrot,. A rebel to tame,. A whitehooded judge,. A syringe and a vein.. And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard. Whatcha say,. Whatcha say,. Whatcha say,. What!. Calm like a bomb!. This ain't subliminal.. Feel the critical mass approach horizon.. The pulse of the condemned. Sound off America's demison.. The anti-myth rhythm rock shocker -. Yes I spit fire.. Hope lies in the smoldering rubble of empires.. Yes, back through the shanties and tha cities remains,. The same bodies buried hungry,. But with different last names.. The vultures rob everyone,. Leave nothing but chains.. Pick a point here at home,. And the picture's the same.. There's a field full of slaves,. Some corn and some debit.. There's a ditch full of bodies,. The check for tha rent.. There's a tap, the phone, the silence of stone. The numb black screen,. That be feelin' like home.. And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard.... Whatcha say,. Whatcha say,. Whatcha say,. What!. Calm like a bomb!. There's a mass without roofs,. A prison to fill,. There's a country's soul that reads post no bills.. There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill.. There's a right to obey. And there's a right to kill."
clampdown,"What are we gonna do now?. Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?. 'Cause they're working for the clampdown. They put up a poster saying we earn more than you+ACE-. When we're working for the clampdown. We will teach our twisted speech. To the young believers. We will train our blue-eyed men. To be young believers. The judge said five to ten-but I say double that again. I'm not working for the clampdown. No man born with a living soul. Can be working for the clampdown. Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall. How can you refuse it?. Let fury have the hour, anger can be power. D'you know that you can use it?. The voices in your head are calling. Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming. Only a fool would think someone could save you. The men at the factory are old and cunning. You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin'. It's the best years of your life they want to steal. You grow up and you calm. down. You're working for the clampdown. You start wearing the blue and brown. You're working for the clampdown. So you got someone to boss around. It makes you feel big now. You drift until you brutalize. You made your first kill now. In these days of evil presidentes. Working for the clampdown. But lately one or two has fully paid their due. For working for the clampdown. But ha Gitalong Gitalong. And I've given away no secrets. Who's barmy now?."

ghost of tom joad,"Men walkin' 'long the railroad tracks. Goin' some place, there's no goin' back. Highway Patrol choppers comin' up over the ridge. Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge.

But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes. I'm sitting down here in the campfire light. Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad. He pulls prayer book out of his sleepin' bag. Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag. Waitin' for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last. In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass. Got a one way ticket to the promised land. You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand. sleeping on a pillow of solid rock. Bathing in the city aqueduct. The highway is alive tonight. But where It's headed everybody knows. I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light. Waitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad. Now Tom Said, ""Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy. Wherever a hungry new born baby cries. Where there's a fight 'gainst the blood and hatred in the air. Look for me mom I'll be there. Wherever there's somebody fightin' for a pIace to stand. Or decent job or a helpin' hand.

As the polls close like a casket. On truth devoured. Silent play in the shadow of power. A spectacle monopolized. The cameras eyes on choice disguised. Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?. Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?. Yes a spectacle monopolized. They hold the reins, stole your eyes. All the fistagons the bullets and bombs. Who stuff the banks. Who staff the party ranks. More for Gore or the son of a drug lord. None of the above fuck it cut the cord. Lights out guerilla Radio. Turn that shit up. Contact I highjacked the frequencies. Blockin the beltway. Move on Dc. Way past the days of bombin Mcs. Sound off Mumia guan be free. Who gottem yo check the federal file. All you pen devils know the trial was vile. Army of pigs try to silence my style. Off em all out that box its my radio dial. Lights out guerilla Radio. Turn that shit up. It has to start somewhere. It has to start sometime.

She clutches her cross. Here comes tha exhaust. And it rips through her lungs. She's off fast to pasture. Like cattle she'll cross. Degree 106. Sweat and vomit are thrown. And she prays and suffocates. Upon tha memories of home. Of yanqui guns for blood debts on tha loans. Of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones. Of granes hidden trapped up in visions of war. Of nothing no one nobody no more. These are her mountains and skies. And she radiates. And through history's rivers of blood. She regenerates. And like tha sun dissapears only to reappear. She's eternally here. Her time is near. Never conquered but there. To tear away at tha mask. And now she got a quota. Tha needle and thread crucifixion. Sold and shipped across tha new line. of Mason Dicon. Rippin' through denim. Tha point an inch from her vein. Tha foreman approach. His steps now pound in her brain. His presence it terrifies. And eclipses her days. No minutes to rest. No moment to pray. And with a whisper. He wips her. Her soul chained to his will. ""My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"". Her arms jerks. Tha sisters gather round her and scream. As if in a dream. Eyes on tha crimson stream. Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to tha floor. Of nothing no one nobody no more. These are her mountains an skies. And she radiates. And through history's rivers of blood. She regenerates. And like tha sun dissapears only to reappear. Maria she's eternally here. Her time is near.

voice of the voiceless,Through steel walls. Your voice is blastin' on. True rebel my brother Mumia. I reflect upon. You be tha spark. That set all tha prairie fires on. Make tha masses a mastodon path. To trample tha fascists on. At fifteen exposed Philly's finest killing machine. With boots and mad guns. They tried to pacify you young. Cause and effect. Smell tha smoke and tha breeze. My panther my brother. we are at war until you're free. You'll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless. You see the powerful got nervous. Cause he refused to be their servant. 'Cause he spit truth. That shook heads. And burned like black churches. Prose and verses. At million poor in hearses. Watch tha decision of Dred Scott. As it reserves. So long as tha rope. Is tight around Mumia's neck. Let there be no rich white life. We bound to respect. Cause and effect. Can't ya smell tha smoke in tha breeze. My panther my brother we are at war until you're free. You'll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless. And Orwell's hell a terror era coming through. But this little brother's watching you too.

Fist in the air in the land of hypocracy. Movements come and movements go. Leaders speak movements sieze when their heads are flown. Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads. Departments of police the judges the feds. Networks at work keepin people calm. You know they went after King, when he spoke out on Vietnam. He turned the power to the have-nots. And then came the shot. With poetry my mind I flex. Flip like Wilson, vocals never lack and dat finesse. Who I got ta who I got to do to wake you up. To shake you up to break the structure up. Cause blood still flows in the gutter. I'm like taking photos. Mad boy kicks open the shutter. Set the grove. Then stick and move like I was Cassius.

Of retribution with mind war. 20/20 visions and murals with metaphors. Networks at work, keepin' people calm. Ya know they murdered X. And tried to blame it on Islam.
