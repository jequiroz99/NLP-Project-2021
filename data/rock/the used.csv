So I could shut you out, and let you go away for a long time.. I guess it´s okay I puke the day away.. I guess it´s better you trapped yourself in your own way.. And if you want me back,. You´re gonna have to ask. I think the chain broke away,. And I felt it the day that I had my own time.. I took advantage of myself and felt fine.. But it was worth the night,. I caught an early flight and I made it home.. I guess it´s okay I puke the day away.. I guess it´s better you trapped yourself in your own way.. And if you want me back,. You´re gonna have to ask nicer than that, nicer than that.. With my foot on your neck, I finally have you. Right where I want you. (4x). I guess it´s okay I puke the day away.. I guess it´s better you trapped yourself in your own way [your own way]. And if you want me back,. You´re gonna have to ask nicer than that, nicer than that..

red heart,"When I really stopped to notice. What I noticed is that. No one stops to notice. Pretty busy when tomorrow gets the focus. Got a great idea and didn't stop. To write it on my phone. I ran straight home. Unpacked the closet?. Found my trumpet. Stole a bus and took my new friends to the mountain. Found a spot where everyone could see. Although no one was looking. Gripped the cornet, wet my lips. And played my sad song to the heavens. On I played until my lips bled. still I could not feel a difference. till I looked up and I noticed. I had everyone's attention. ""Now that I have your deliberation. Let me formulate a most confusing situation. set to stimulate and satiate our saturated notions. moving closer to the truth with no expulsions, segregations. As of now we're all a part of that machine they talked about. Don't you remember that band rage against the machine. Let's go deeper now than what John Lennon. Aaid about the war, and what would happen. If no soldiers took the field. If 1 and 1 is 2; and 2 and 2's a billiontrillionzillion. and the moon's front screen projection. super sacerdotalism. bought and paid through hidden taxes. through the power if inflation. If its all to much to handle let me tell you what I think. What I believe and what I hope for. What I'd fight for. And have faith in. And that is love. Love sweet love. Yea that is love. Love sweet love. "". Red heart. ""If you think you already know all the answers. you could listen. seems the smartest men I know obtain. The most important questions. And we've got to get it wrong along the way. Failure's important. Must get bashed more than a little bit. To understand what pain is. Until we truly understand. Have we a chance then to be free?. by free I mean devoid of pain. the absence of the guilt of shame. The mercy of the love of man. humanity's the truest name. But first we'll have to face the truth. And that is where the pain comes in. Let's start at the beginning. Start somewhere in our youth. Take everything we learned. And that we counted on as truth. Kill all the messengers and simply kick the barrels over. Picture a world without answers. Pictures carving, in our minds. shattered debris of opinion. Instead of only freedom from the truth. There comes fire in our hearts. Metabolized into organized. Truly democratized hordes and masses. ranks and classes. sane one's and spastics. Your moms and your dads's. Together we stand like a brick wall. We tower. And no longer we grovel. No longer we cower. We never apologize, why should we ever?. no one to apologize to but each other. No sir, Mr. President. No sir to your war. No sir, big prime minister. No, not like before. no thanks mr pope, mr dictator too. No longer will we play in what you like to call games. For we realize that your way affords no peaceful choices. No virtue in walking your tight-rope of peace-rape. We want NOTHING to do with your brand-new-world-order. I'm sure as we walk and work out our own path. We'll figure it out on our way like we do. and did we ever need you?. never needed you. We did it with love. Love sweet love. Yea we got there with love. Love sweet love. "". Red heart"

poetic tragedy,"POETIC TRAGEDY. The cup is not half empty as pessimists say. As far as he's sees nothing's left in the cup. A whole cup full of nothing for him to induldge. Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up. A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere. He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was..... is just a tragedy. So he voyages in circles. Succeeds getting nowhere. and submits to the substance. That first got him there. Than in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no one. Is there a point to this madness and all that he was..... Is just a tragedy. He feels alone. His heart in his hand. He's alone. He feels alone. I feel.... The on that last day he breaks. And he stood tall. And he yelled... and he takes his life. {why world, why world, hate you, hate you, bye world}. Violent frustration. He cries out to God or just no one. Is there a point to this madness. And all that he was is just a tragedy. por gabitch"

it's hard to say,"The singer finished singing and she's walking out. The singer sheds a tear fear of falling out. and it's hard to say how I feel today. For years gone by, and I cried.

a song to stifle imperial progression (a work in progress),"We're saying no way, no way USA. By declaring war on terror. you declare war on yourself. The war on drugs and poverty. Are only tools for gaining wealth. You occupy the peoples land. And think we don't know what it's for?. Drill a hole and fuck the ground. And spend the cash and print some more. We're sayin no way, no way USA. Try mixing blood and oil in the Middle East. Every president will ""spread democracy"". They say democracy. They really mean DISEASE. Not satisfied till everyone is on their knees. So god bless the USA for what it's worth and let it be. Because there is no god. There is no USA, from what I see.

Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are. Fightin' fire with fire. All wet hey you might need a raincoat. Shape down Dreams walking in broad daylight. Three hundred sixty five degrees. Burning down the house. It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself. Gonna come in first place. People on their way to work baby what did you expect. Gonna burst into flame. My house is out of the ordinary. That's right Don't want to hurt nobody. Some things sure can sweep me off my feet. Burning down the house.

evolution,"Call me a traitor for changing my mind. Call me a criminal if thinking's a crime. Call me an animal, it's hard to define. Don't care what you say: I came to defy. I've come so far.

Everyone trying to be everyone else. Everything changes. With the way that I feel. Seems impossible I'll stay the same. Go back to the middle try filling the void. Watch thoughts into action? it's hard to destroy. Call me an animal and I won't deny. I don't care what you say. I came to defy. What will you do to me when I refuse to go.

force without silence,Or maybe copulate. I'll try to articulate. Go find seclusion. Try self reproduction. Autogamy's nation. Epidemic inflationour voices steal silence. The plans that we've made. The dead cannot hear all the prayers that we beg. Is there force without violence (?). Is there a catch with no hook. Believing the lies while they fix all the books. Things will never change. If we remain the same. Our hearts call us by name. These walls won't keep us safe. When they hold us back like barricades. It's our time to replace these walls. The walls around our hearts. There is no price we won't pay. And we'll steal it back just to give it away. It's our time to replace these walls. The walls around our hearts. When fear breaks the silence the choice has been made. We're listening now to the sounds from the grave. This brave opposition comes naturally. Being exactly who we're supposed to be. Things will never change. If we remain the same. Our hearts call us by name. Won't take what we're given. Won't pay pray for our freedom. (I don't have to say fuck you. When I can say fornicate. Stroking your soaking. And slippery faith. Keep pulling hard. Till you cover your face. Don't have to call you a dick. When I can say hypocrite. Treacherous hideous. Ridiculous phallus. Erected insidious. Meddling mischievous. Hyper-banal. Intellectual syphilis. Keeping to crusty philosophy's clever. Standing out just like the rest. Just a member.)

light with a sharpened edge,Free from the torment of sin. All this I'm giving up. Much as the sun would decide to give in. Exploding to orange. And hear all the voices sing praises and hymns. Mark the birth of a change. Free from the torment of sin. All this I'm giving up. Chorus. It's not me. Buried wreckage my soul. It's not me. so who am I now. Over and over again. Light with a sharpened edge. Cut through the black empty space we call sky. Beginning the cycle that stays. And I know in my heart we all die. Like the day and the night. Like the sun in the sky. All this I'm giving up. It's not me. Buried wreckage my soul. It's not me. so who am I now?. Is there another side?. Beat out the black and white. Place I could meet you by. A place on the other side. I'll let you know when I go. When I'm gone. It's not me. Buried wreckage my soul. It's not me. so who am I now?

poetic tragedy,"POETIC TRAGEDY. The cup is not half empty as pessimists say. As far as he's sees nothing's left in the cup. A whole cup full of nothing for him to induldge. Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up. A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere. He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was..... is just a tragedy. So he voyages in circles. Succeeds getting nowhere. and submits to the substance. That first got him there. Than in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no one. Is there a point to this madness and all that he was..... Is just a tragedy. He feels alone. His heart in his hand. He's alone. He feels alone. I feel.... The on that last day he breaks. And he stood tall. And he yelled... and he takes his life. {why world, why world, hate you, hate you, bye world}. Violent frustration. He cries out to God or just no one. Is there a point to this madness. And all that he was is just a tragedy. por gabitch"

red heart,"When I really stopped to notice. What I noticed is that. No one stops to notice. Pretty busy when tomorrow gets the focus. Got a great idea and didn't stop. To write it on my phone. I ran straight home. Unpacked the closet?. Found my trumpet. Stole a bus and took my new friends to the mountain. Found a spot where everyone could see. Although no one was looking. Gripped the cornet, wet my lips. And played my sad song to the heavens. On I played until my lips bled. still I could not feel a difference. till I looked up and I noticed. I had everyone's attention. ""Now that I have your deliberation. Let me formulate a most confusing situation. set to stimulate and satiate our saturated notions. moving closer to the truth with no expulsions, segregations. As of now we're all a part of that machine they talked about. Don't you remember that band rage against the machine. Let's go deeper now than what John Lennon. Aaid about the war, and what would happen. If no soldiers took the field. If 1 and 1 is 2; and 2 and 2's a billiontrillionzillion. and the moon's front screen projection. super sacerdotalism. bought and paid through hidden taxes. through the power if inflation. If its all to much to handle let me tell you what I think. What I believe and what I hope for. What I'd fight for. And have faith in. And that is love. Love sweet love. Yea that is love. Love sweet love. "". Red heart. ""If you think you already know all the answers. you could listen. seems the smartest men I know obtain. The most important questions. And we've got to get it wrong along the way. Failure's important. Must get bashed more than a little bit. To understand what pain is. Until we truly understand. Have we a chance then to be free?. by free I mean devoid of pain. the absence of the guilt of shame. The mercy of the love of man. humanity's the truest name. But first we'll have to face the truth. And that is where the pain comes in. Let's start at the beginning. Start somewhere in our youth. Take everything we learned. And that we counted on as truth. Kill all the messengers and simply kick the barrels over. Picture a world without answers. Pictures carving, in our minds. shattered debris of opinion. Instead of only freedom from the truth. There comes fire in our hearts. Metabolized into organized. Truly democratized hordes and masses. ranks and classes. sane one's and spastics. Your moms and your dads's. Together we stand like a brick wall. We tower. And no longer we grovel. No longer we cower. We never apologize, why should we ever?. no one to apologize to but each other. No sir, Mr. President. No sir to your war. No sir, big prime minister. No, not like before. no thanks mr pope, mr dictator too. No longer will we play in what you like to call games. For we realize that your way affords no peaceful choices. No virtue in walking your tight-rope of peace-rape. We want NOTHING to do with your brand-new-world-order. I'm sure as we walk and work out our own path. We'll figure it out on our way like we do. and did we ever need you?. never needed you. We did it with love. Love sweet love. Yea we got there with love. Love sweet love. "". Red heart"
revolution,It's not enough to kill the past. Be blind to history. And all at once there's a black cloud comin. Made of GASoline. I see that you have set the price. Made sure nothing's free. One way to move forward. Is to learn who's stopping me. This is the end. Calling for revolution. Burn: like a fire in the rain. (we looked at the price tag). and it's one we can't afford. We were taught that progression means accumulating more. it's not to protect ourselves so why are we at war. Isn't it obvious or adding up the score. I'll never turn my back on where I'm from. I'll never stop believing. I'll always love my home? but. From that love I've noticed who's been burned. I've noticed who's still bleeding. It seems the fire has grown. So from now on I pledge allegiance. To a world that's so much different. Where everyone has the chance to be free. Revolution starts with me

the ocean of the sky,"The war is over if there was a war. I hope we won. A little boy waits with a lever on his own. So I craft a ship to fly my way back home. When the ocean of the sky swallows me whole. I've never felt so far from home and I like it. Never been so left alone for so long. Forget the meaning but it needs one now. Yet I pretended that it did somehow. I'm going home. The hand, the slavemaster, what guessed his eye. Lie in pets. Showed me just how closely men resemble pigs. For the blind man that must journey into hell. I was surprised to meet my mother there as well. I've never felt so far from home and I like it. Never been so left alone for so long. Forget the meaning but it needs one now. Yet I pretended that it did somehow. I'm going home. I saw him flat so awkward up my hand. Below the stars. He hopped in my bed we pretended to be friends. But his sigh that could have torn this man apart. And in his face I saw the canopy inferno. I've never felt so far from home and I like it. Never been so left alone for so long. Forget the meaning but it needs one now. And I pretended that it did somehow. I'm going home"

veteran's memorial,"[Prodigy]. Memories play back like film. I flash back we was little niggas livin most real. 1989's when we first met. We first clicked over convo' gettin twisted. In dunn grand earth crib cuttin outta school. Watchin cable it seemed like the other day. Through the eyes of a stranger we was kids. But in our own minds we was grown mens. Outside on the block we would play the bench. And y'all play the rock every chance y'all got. As I sat back and just watched hey, what can I say?. The same back then as I am today. I can recall me, Jemel and Jamal. In the room drinkin straight vodka with they moms. When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm. Back with the light blue camoflauge suit. God me and Hav' doin it hard, tryin to get on. We sampled songs on the box with record and pause. Killer B didnt even get his first firearm. And I was still holdin one shot derringers. [Hook: Prodigy]. Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist. Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce. Sometimes I see a chick walkin past with ya kids. Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-5th. All the shit that we been through it boils to this?. Dun, I wish we could start it all over again. [Prodigy]. Ninety-five, we on top tourin the states. A lotta times we even took the click overseas. Came along way from the hallway. Sitting in the staircase with Bacardi. Bring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang. While we would share drinks with the other that came. Triple L stayed takin they cash in dice games. Killer Black grew to keep an ice grill, dunn was not playin. Yammy, the most Infamous told me one day. ""Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P"". But it was all love, we was eash others dunns. We held each other down, borrowed each other guns. Its hard to believe that niggas so strong. could die so easily forever be gone. I could still feel the web of your palm, against mine. cause we did our hand shake all the time. Why it have to be your time to go and not mines?. Spilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin. All the laughs we shared and fights we had. All the nights we would get nice, damn. Plates of food we split in half. I dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed. [Hook]. [Prodigy]. What the fuckin deal, motherfuckin Scarface nigga, killer. For Bean, Fugi, Gooey, (I can't take no more nigga), Corey. Black Ed, the fuck, knahmsayin? Ill Will burnin. Harry, fuck yo, I can't take no more man. Frankie, Spank, whattup man? Straight up. My grandmoms man, my granddad man. Grandma Brooks, straight up my pops man. Straight up man, that's it. All my dead, all my dead. Man, the little babies man, no more man. Abortion babies man, I can't take no more man. I'll never forget you, all my dead it's all love man. Motherfuckin Yambo, in a minute, we'll be there. Motherfuckin Yammy, straight up, I can't wait. You was my strength nigga, I miss y'all. I can't believe you gone nigga. What the fuck happened?. Ain't nobody else goin away man. You ain't takin nuttin else from me man. Nobody can't take nuttin else from me man that's it. I dare you! Come try, it's over man. You can't take nuttin else from us yo... That's my word, I put my life on it. I'll be next nigga, straight up!. I stand up for that. Cause ain't none of my niggaz goin, that's enough. We had enough. It's the Veteran's Memorial right here man, straight up man.
