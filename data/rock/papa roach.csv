I've been living in my anxieties"
march out of the darkness,"It feels like the end of the world. It seems like nobody cares. Is it real or am I going insane. Am I ever gonna change my ways?. Isolated, separated. Sick of the mess I've created. The pressure keeps rising. When the truth is what I'm finding. We march out of the darkness. We revel in the flames. The mission is accomplished. We're ready for the changes. And the only thing that will set us free. Is living through the pain. And the only thing that we cannot take. Will never be the same. It feels like I'm still in a cage. And I scream 'til I'm blue in the face. Is it real or is it a phase. I think the time is gonna change my ways. I'm ready, I'm willing. To take what I've been given. The pressure keeps rising. 'cause the truth is what I'm finding. [Refrão]. It's ok, it's alright. Just let go, you'll be fine. It's ok, it's alright. Just let go, you'll be fine. [Refrão]. . . by Recco"

not that beautiful,"I pray you're the best and I run from the past. I pick up the bones to find I'm alone. It's wearing me out in the way that my seems. Killed the faith that I had so it's time I begin. Back to this darkness to see how it feels. I was the one with the dark you could heal. Now that it's over it's time to move on. ‘Cause I was the righteous and you were the wrong. Every time I try to run and hide I feel you haunting me. I'm addicted to the games that you play. You make me feel so pitiful. Like you're so beautiful. Your heart is beating me to death every day. But I am not that pitiful. You're not that beautiful. I slide from the side just to feel I'm alive. I bury the truth ‘cause I know it's a lie. I never said all the things that you say. ‘Cause you were the master and I was a slave. If I could find me a truck to forget you. I'd only take some day that I met you. Kill every time and it's time to move on. ‘Cause I am the righteous and you were the wrong. Every time I try to run and hide I feel you haunting me. I'm addicted to the games that you play. You make me feel so pitiful. Like you're so beautiful. Your heart is beating me to death every day. But I am not that pitiful. You're not that beautiful. I'm not that pitiful. You're not so beautiful. Every time I look at your eyes I see a demon in disguise. You fucking make me sick, you are the one that I despise. You take me, you break me, you feed me lies. And only to gain in return was my demise. So maybe I'm just crazy for believing this shit. But goddamn I can't believe I'm fucking dealing with this. It's like a nightmare and I can't wake up. I just can't wake up. I'm addicted to the games that you play. You make me feel so pitiful. Like you're so beautiful.

And thanks to my mom. Cuz she has stuck by. To raise me. I was fighting all the time. But with god help. Releasing all my tension. Through my knockin my hand. I'm coming out. I'm a freaked out cat. Coming out stony. And wet. Gonna be picking it up. For the boys who got slack in a band. Papa Roach four fingers. Of a hand. Retarded. Shut up n die. Shut up n die. I said you fucking die.

wish you never met me,Wish You Never Met Me. Papa Roach. This is the moment that I've feared the most. Helplessly watching as return to ghosts. Is it over?. Tell me if it's over. This is the hardest thing I've ever done. Hopelessly waiting as you turn and run. Is it over?. Is it really over?. I promise you that I will change. Then I broke it in a million ways. I alone take the blame. While you take the pain. Why can't we stop this over?. What have we done to us?. You say that you need closure. I am just giving up on us. I refuse to fade away. As you're trying to forget me. Take my heart and walk away. Like you wish you never met me. Now that I know that you're not on my side. What good is love if it's always denied. Is it over?. Is it really over?. I swore to God that I could change. But I let you down a million ways. I alone take the blame. While you take the pain. Why can't we stop this over?. What have we done to us?. You say that you need closure. I am just giving up on us. I refuse to fade away. As you're trying to forget me. Take my heart and walk away. Like you wish you never met me. Like you wish you never met me. Like you wish you never met me. Like you wish you never met me. Do you wish you never met me?. Why can't we stop this over?. What have we done to us?. You say that you need closure. I am just giving up. Why can't we stop this over?. What have we done to us?. You say that you need closure. I am just giving up on us. I refuse to fade away. As you're trying to forget me. Take my heart and walk away. Like you wish you never met me. I refuse to fade away. As you're trying to forget me. Take my heart and walk away. Like you wish you never met me. Like you wish you never met me. Like you wish you never met me. Like you wish you never met me. Do you wish you never met me?
