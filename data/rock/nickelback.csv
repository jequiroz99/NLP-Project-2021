photograph,"Look at this photograph. Everytime I do it makes me laugh. How did our eyes get so red. And what the hell is on Joey's head. And this is where I grew up. I think the present owner fixed it up. I never knew we'd ever went without. The second floor is hard for sneaking out. And this is where I went to school. Most of the time had better things to do. Criminal record says I broke in twice. I must have done it half a dozen times. I wonder if It's too late. Should I go back and try to graduate. Life's better now than it was back then. If I was them I wouldn't let me in. Oh oh oh. Oh God I. Every memory of looking out the back door. I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door. I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Remember the old arcade. Blew every dollar that we ever made. The cops hated us hangin' out. They say somebody went and burned it down. We used to listen to the radio. And sing along with every song we know. We said someday we'd find out how it feels. To sing to more than just the steering wheel. Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed. She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since God knows when. Oh oh oh. Oh God I. Every memory of looking out the back door. I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it.

I miss the faces. You can't erase. You can't replace it. I miss it now. I can't believe it. So hard to stay. Too hard to leave it. If I could relive those days. I know the one thing that would never change. Every memory of looking out the back door. I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye.

if today was your last day,My best friend gave me the best advice. He said each day's a gift and not a given right. Leave no stone unturned. Leave your fears behind. And try to take the path less travelled by. That first step you take is the longest stride. If today was your last day. And tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last?. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had?. If today was your last day. Against the grain should be a way of life. What's worth the price is always worth the fight. Every second counts 'cause. There's no second try. So live like you're never livin twice. Don't take the free ride in your own life. If today was your last day. And tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last?. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had?. Would you call those friends you've never seen?. Reminisce old memories?. Would you forgive your enemies?. Would you find that one your dreaming of?. Swear up and down to God above. That you'll finally fall in love?. If today was your last day. If today was your last day. Would you make it up by mending a broken heart. You know it's never too late. To shoot for the stars. Regardless of who you are. So do whatever it takes. 'Cause you can't rewind. A moment in this life. Let nothing stand in your way. Cause the hands of time are never on your side. If today was your last day. And tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last?. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had?. Would you call those friends you've never seen?. Reminisce old memories?. Would you forgive your enemies?. Would you find that one your dreaming of?. Swear up and down to God above. That you'll finally fall in love?. If today was your last day
lullaby,"Well I know the feeling. Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge. And there ain't no healing. From cutting yourself with a jagged edge. I'm telling you that. It's never that bad. Take it from someone who's been where you're at. Laid out on the floor. And you're not sure. You can take this anymore. So just give it one more try. With a lullaby. And turn this up on the radio. If you can hear me now. I'm reaching out. To let you know that you're not alone. And if you can't tell. And you scare yourself. Cause I can't get you on the telephone. So just close your eyes. Oh, honey here comes a lullaby. Your very own lullaby. Please let me take you. Out of the darkness and into the light. Cause I have faith in you. That you're going to make it through another night. Stop thinking about the easy way out. There's no need to go and blow the candle out. Because you're not done. You're far too young. And the best is yet to come. So just give it one more try. With a lullaby. And turn this up on the radio. If you can hear me now. I'm reaching out. To let you know that you're not alone. And if you can't tell. And you scare yourself. Cause I can't get you on the telephone. So just close your eyes. Oh, honey here comes a lullaby. Your very own lullaby. Well everybody's hit the bottom. Everybody's been forgotten. When everybody's tired of being alone. And everybody's been abandoned. I left a little empty handed. So if you're ever barely hanging on. Just give it one more try. With a lullaby. And turn this up on the radio. If you can hear me now. I'm reaching out. To let you know that you're not alone. And if you can't tell. And you scare yourself. Cause I can't get you on the telephone. So just close your eyes. Oh, honey here comes a lullaby. Your very own lullaby. Oh, honey here comes a lullaby. Your very own lullaby"

trying not to love you,"You call to me, and I fall at your feet. How could anyone ask for more?. And our time apart, like knives in my heart. How could anyone ask for more?. But if there's a pill to help me forget. God knows I haven't found it yet. But I'm dying to, god I'm trying to. Trying not to love you, only goes so far. Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart. Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor. And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for. Cause trying not to love you. Only makes me love you more. Only makes me love you more. And this kind of pain, only time takes away. That's why it's harder to let you go. And nothing I can do, without thinking of you. That's why it's harder to let you go. But if there's a pill to help me forget. God knows I haven't found it yet. But I'm dying to, god I'm trying to. Trying not to love you, only goes so far. Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart. Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor. And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for. Cause trying not to love you. Only makes me love you more. So I sit here divided, just talking to myself. Was it something that I did?. Was there somebody else?. When a voice from behind me,. That was fighting back tears. Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear. Tonight I'm dying to tell you. That trying not to love you, only went so far. Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart. Now I see the silver lining, from what we've fighting for. If we just keep on trying, we could be much more. 'Cause trying not to love you, ohhhh. Trying not love you. Only makes me love you more. Only makes me love you more"
i'd come for you,"Just one more moment, that's all that's needed.. Like wounded soldiers in need of healing.. Time to be honest, this time I'm bleeding. Please dont dwell on it,.

That I can make it up to you now, somehow.. By now you'd know that I'd come for you. No one but you, yes I'd come for you. But only if you told me too. And I'd fight for you. I'd lie, it's true. Give my life for you. You know I'd always come for you. I was blindfolded, but now im seeing. My mind was closing, now I'm believing. I finally know what just what it means to let someone in. To see the side of me that no one does or ever will. So if your ever lost and find yourself all alone. I'd search forever just to bring you home,. Here and now this I vow. By now you'd know that I'd come for you. No one but you, yes I'd come for you. But only if you told me too. And I'd fight for you. I'd lie, it's true. Give my life for you.

song on fire,"The first words that come out. And I can see this song will be about you. I can't believe that I can breathe without you. But all I need to do is carry on. The next line I write down. And there's a tear that falls between the pages. I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages. But it depends which one it's standing on. I write lines down, then rip them up. Describing love can't be this tough. I could set this song on fire. Send it up in smoke. I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly. Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon. Play it for the world, but it won't mean much. Unless I sing this song to you. I'm dying to show you. This could end happily ever after. There doesn't ever have to be disaster. And all you have to do is sing along. I write lines down, then rip them up. Impossible describing love. I could set this song on fire. Send it up in smoke. I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly. Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon. Play it for the world, but it won't mean much. Unless I sing this song to you. I could set this song on fire. Sing this song to you. I could set this song on fire. Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes. Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost. Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune. Play it for the world, but it won't mean much. I could set this song on fire. Send it up in smoke. I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly. Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon. Play it for the world, but it won't mean much. Unless I sing this song to you. I could set this song on fire. Sing this song to you. I could set this, I could set this. I wanna sing this song to you. I could set this song on fire. Sing this song to you. I could set this, I could set this"

gotta be somebody,This time. I wonder what it fells like. To find the one in this life. The one we all dream of. But dreams just aren't enough. So I'll be waiting for the real thing. I'll know it by the feeling. The moment when we're meeting. Will play out like a scene. Straight off the silver screen. So I'll be holding my breath. Right up to the end. Until that moment when. I'll find the one that I'll spend forever with. 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there. 'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares. Someone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me like that. 'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own. Everyone wants to know they're not alone. Somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there. Tonight. Out on the street. Out in the moonlight. And dammit this feels too right. It's just like déjàvu. Me standing here with you. So I'll be holding my breath. Could this be the end?. Isn't that moment when. I find the one that I'll spend forever with. 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there. 'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares. Someone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me like that. 'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own. Everyone wants to know they're not alone. Somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there. Ooooo. You can't give up. (When you're looking for). The diamond in the rough. (You never know). It shows up. (Make sure you're holding on). 'Cause it could be the one. The one you're waiting on. 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there. Everyone wants to feel like someone cares. Someone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me. Ohhhhhhh. Nobody wants to do it on their own. Everyone wants to know they're not alone. Somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there. Nobody wants to be the last one there. Everyone wants to feel like someone cares. Somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Just trying to keep clothing on our backs. And all I hear about is. How it's so bad, it's so bad. It's too bad, It's stupid. Too late, so wrong, so long. It's too bad that we had no time to rewind. Let's walk, let's talk. Let's talk. You left without saying goodbye. Although I'm sure you tried. You call the house from time to time. To make sure we're alive. But you weren't there. Right when I needed you the most. And now I dream about it. How it's so bad, it's so bad. It's too bad, It's stupid. Too late, so wrong, so long. It's too bad that we had no time to rewind. Let's walk, let's talk. Let's talk. Father's hands are lined with guilt. For tearing us apart. Guess it turned out in the end. Just look at where we are. Made it out, still got clothing on our backs. And now I scream about it. How it's so bad, it's so bad. It's too bad, it's stupid. Too late, so wrong, so long. It's too bad that we had no time to rewind. Let's walk, let's talk. Let's talk.

No shirt, shit faced. We got'em lined up, shot down,. Firing back straight crown. We're going off tonight. To kick out every light. Take anything we want. Drink everything in sight. We're going till the world stops turning. While we burn it to the ground tonight. Oohhh. Ticking like a time bomb, drinking till the nights gone. Well get you hands off of this glass,. Last call my ass. Weeelllll no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop. We got no friend, no doubt, all-in, balls out. We're going off tonight. To kick out every light. Take anything we want.

coin for the ferryman,"Flying down the highway like a bat out of hell. My buddy Bradley's in the middle. he's lookin' out the window. We just got high and hopin' no one could tell. But with the icky and the sticky. it don't matter where the wind blows. Lighter in my hand and I got nothing to burn. Except a little turpentine inside of those five paint cans. Pick up a shotgun and we'll all take turns. But don't you ever say a word. cause you know momma's gonna hate that. The dice that we've been rollin'. Where our lives are bitter stolen. When you're walking through the fire for fun. Tidal wave in motion. You can't hide from the explosion. In 3... 2... 1. We're smokin' dynamite. Too many fuses to light. (Our kingdom come, on the run). Gonna steal, beg and borrow. A thousand Fahrenheits. And we're about to ignite. (So keep the throttle to the bottom). We may never see tomorrow. If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know. We'll need a coin for the ferryman. Leave us a coin for the ferryman. Countin' every nickel, dime and five dollar bill. So we've been stealin' gasoline and laying low. out on the backroads. The city lights are glowin' over the hill. And we can make it. but we take the chance of never coming back home. The dice that we've been rollin'. Where our lives are bitter stolen. When you're walking through the fire for fun. Tidal wave in motion. You can't hide from the explosion. In 3... 2... 1. We're smokin' dynamite. Too many fuses to light. (Our kingdom come, on the run). Gonna steal, beg and borrow. A thousand Fahrenheits. And we're about to ignite. (So keep the throttle to the bottom). We may never see tomorrow. If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know. We'll need a coin for the ferryman. Leave us a coin for the ferryman. One for the road and one for those who never leave. One for the Lord and take it from the devil. Don't even try, 'cause you know you can't hide. Better run, better run, better run. We're smokin' dynamite. Too many fuses to light. (Our kingdom come, on the run). Gonna steal, beg and borrow. A thousand Fahrenheits. And we're about to ignite. (So keep the throttle to the bottom). We may never see tomorrow. If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know. We're smokin' dynamite.

cowboy hat,"Yes he wore a cowboy hat. Each bone broken in his back. All the money and all the gold. Couldn't buy my love at 8 years old. Now I'm in love with a girl thats wrong for me. Ask her, she will disagree. Her father was a small time man. With small time dreams and small time hands. But. But I was there when there was nobody home. Please believe me when I say I dunno. Gone for good in fact but what does it mean. Within a year they always sold and bought. Easy enough to just look at her. Whole world on a silver platter. Was that that bad for me. If I was there the scotch is free. Won round one but its not over. He don't care cause he don't know her. True love is not the same. If I could lend a hand in shame. But I was there when there was nobody home. Please believe me when I say I dunno. Gone for good infact but what does it mean. Within a year they always sold and bought. If I was big. So much easier to see. Don't hide from me. That which i've already seen. You lie to me. More than occasionally. Don't lie to me. You lied to me. I'm as high as i'll ever be. I don't mind, stay and see. They've all gone, why don't we. Holding hands, you and me. But I'm as high as i'll ever be. But later on, lies to see. My past is gone, only from me. I'm alive. But I was there when there was nobody home. Please believe me when I say I dunno. Gone for good infact but what does it mean. Within a year they always sold and bought. Remember when it was me. Driving come down just for me. And then we'll try as we've been"

Anywhere my brother leads me to. We don't want to live in the sun. Just to keep them happy for awhile. Midnight, and Frank freaks out and reaches God and. Fairly tied up too. But I know why I will always follow you. Anywhere my brother leads me to. And I remember wanting to be you. And pray to God that we would all pull through. Cause I know why I will always follow you. If you're my brother, then I will follow you. Lifelong friends threw bottle ends. And yell in the air like lifelong enemies. Who's stronger, who's lived longer?. World quarrels and grandkids on your knee. Cause I know I will always follow. Anywhere my brother leads me to. And I remember wanting to be you. And pray to God that we would all pull through. Cause I know why I will always follow you. If you're my brother, then I will follow you. Cause I know why I will always follow. I will follow you and I will. I know why I will always follow"

Kick 'em when they're up. Kick 'em all around. [Verse 1]. I make my living off the evening news. Just give me something, something I can use. People love it when you lose. They love dirty laundry. Well, I could've been an actor, but I wound up here. I just have to look good; I don't have to be clear. Come and whisper in my ear. Give us dirty laundry. PUBLICIDADE. inRead invented by Teads.

She can tell you 'bout the plane crash. With a gleam in her eye. It's interesting when people die. Give us dirty laundry. Can we film the operation?. Is the head dead yet?. And all the boys in the newsroom. Got a running bet. Get the widow on the set. We need dirty laundry. [Chorus]. Kick 'em when they're up. Kick 'em when they're down. Kick 'em when they're up. Kick 'em when they're down. Kick 'em when they're up. Kick 'em when they're down. Kick 'em when they're up. Kick 'em all around. [Bridge]. Dirty little secrets. Dirty little lies. We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pies. We love to cut you down to size. We love dirty laundry. We can do the innuendo. We can dance and sing. When it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing. We all know that crap is king. Give us dirty laundry. [Chorus]. Kick 'em when they're up. Kick 'em when they're down. Kick 'em when they're up.

Every time we're together. It's funny how we change. And some things stay the same. God, I miss the glory days always. With daylight getting near. We shed a few more tears.

She's gonna be my sex machine. And I can never get her under control. She's gonna climb all over me. I'm like a pony in my own rodeo. And I can't get enough of the things that she does. And I can't get enough of the things that she does. She's gonna be my midnight queen. Lock and load and I'm ready to go. She's gonna lick my pistol clean. She's got ahold of me and ain't letting go. She's gonna be my sex machine. And I can never get her under control. She's gonna climb all over me. I'm like a pony in my own rodeo. And I can't get enough of the things that she does, alright"
million miles an hour,I can taste the color of colors. Take one of those and two of these. Then watch the walls begin to breathe. I can taste the color of the lights. Wings are growing out of me. The floor is floating under me. I can see the future burning bright. Is it burning bright?. The ceiling has us mesmerized. It feels like we could never die. Heading for the dark side of the moon. As we lift off into the sky. Invincible and so alive. Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof. Insanity is setting in. Reality is getting thin. The universe just started slowing down. And suddenly we're travelling. A million miles an hour. A million miles an hour. We're going a million miles an hour. A million miles an hour. When shadows soon start breaking free. No longer held by gravity. When we get so far from the ground. Speaking to the galaxy. Receiving and sending back to me. I can finally hear the speed of sound. The speed of fucking sound. I like this everlasting pill. Coz time itself is standing still. Why's the room still spinning just the same?. Turn off your phone so no-one calls. Coz you and I are tripping balls. I can still hear ringing in my brain. Insanity is setting in. Reality is getting thin. The universe just started slowing down. And suddenly we're travelling. A million miles an hour. A million miles an hour. We're going a million miles an hour. A million miles an hour. Insanity is setting in. Reality is getting thin. The universe just started slowing down. And suddenly we're travelling. A million miles an hour. A million miles an hour. We're going a million miles an hour. A million miles an hour
miss you,"I miss you so so I do. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so. I just woke up from a dream today. The time gone by, but you still look the same. It felt so real to have you back with me. It's just too bad it's just another dream. Give me just one wish!. If I could give it all away. I'd do it just for one more day. I thought I had the time to wait. Now it's too late to tell you that I. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so much. I miss you so so I do. God knows I do, I. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so much.

But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away. Give me just one wish!. If I could give it all away. I'd do it just for one more day. And traded it in for one more moment. Tell you what I never told you. All the things I left unsaid. I meant to say them before you left. I thought I had the time to wait. Now it's too late to tell you that I. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so much. I miss you so so I do. God knows I do, I. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so much. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so so I do. If there was some way you know I would.

If I could give it all away. I'd do it just for one more day. And traded it in for one more moment. Tell you what I never told you. All the things I left unsaid. I meant to say them before you left. I though I had the time to wait. Now it's too late to tell you that I. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so much. I miss you so so I do. God knows I do, I. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so much. I miss you so so I do. I miss you so"

photograph,"Look at this photograph. Everytime I do it makes me laugh. How did our eyes get so red. And what the hell is on Joey's head. And this is where I grew up. I think the present owner fixed it up. I never knew we'd ever went without. The second floor is hard for sneaking out. And this is where I went to school. Most of the time had better things to do. Criminal record says I broke in twice. I must have done it half a dozen times. I wonder if It's too late. Should I go back and try to graduate. Life's better now than it was back then.

Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door. I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Remember the old arcade. Blew every dollar that we ever made. The cops hated us hangin' out. They say somebody went and burned it down. We used to listen to the radio. And sing along with every song we know. We said someday we'd find out how it feels. To sing to more than just the steering wheel. Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed. She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since God knows when. Oh oh oh. Oh God I. Every memory of looking out the back door. I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door. I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. I miss that town. I miss the faces. You can't erase. You can't replace it. I miss it now. I can't believe it. So hard to stay. Too hard to leave it. If I could relive those days. I know the one thing that would never change. Every memory of looking out the back door. I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door. I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Look at this photograph.

I don't want to snatch. Get away from me. Stay the hell away. And I will give up my mind. And I will give my way. And I will pluck out my eyes. Yes I will feel my way. Yes I will.

Tough to put the brakes on. Doesn't matter when you got to. Get up and go out, me and all my friends. Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again. Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon. Landlord says I should buy a tent. But he can kiss my ass cause I paid the rent. So I doubt, he'll kick me out this afternoon. Down on the corner in a seedy bar. Jukebox cranking out the CCR. Had a few to Suzie Q this afternoon, oh!. (Chorus). Better hang on if you're taggin along. Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning. Nothing wrong with going all night long. Tough to put the brakes on. Doesn't matter when you got to. Get up and go out, me and all my friends. Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again. Get up, go out, me and all my friends. Drink up, fall down, we'll do it all again. Yeah, Just sitting around hanging out this afternoon. Don't want a wristwatch, or an alarm clock. to see what time it is. From the moment I wake up,. I just love being with my friends. We barely get by,. but have the best times. and hope it never ends. We drink all day until we fall down,. so we can do it all again. It's not the human walk, it's the human race. If we were living on the edge,. taking too much space. So I'll doubt I'll figure out just what to do. But to kicking around,. hanging out this afternoon, oh!. (Chorus). Better hang on if you're taggin along. Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning. Nothing wrong with going all night long. Tough to put the brakes on. Doesn't matter when you got to. Get up and go out, me and all my friends. Drink up and fall down, we'll do it all again. Get up and go out, me and all my friends. Drink up and fall down we'll do it all again. Just kickin around, hanging out this afternnon. Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon"
this means war,"Climb into the ring for a battle that you can't win. Swing as hard as you can swing it will still mean nothing. Shoulda seen it comin' it had to happen sometime. But you went and brought a knife to an all out gun fight. And the only thing to save. Is the banner that you wave. To be wrapped around your grave. You've gone too far (get up, get up). Who do you think you are (get up, so we can finish this). Is this what you came for (get up, get up). Well this means war (get up, so we can finish this). Say anything you want but talk will get you nowhere. The only thing you brought was psychological warfare. There's no getting out and now you gotta wonder. Who will dig you out when you're six feet under. And the only thing to save. Is the banner that you wave. To be wrapped around your grave. You've gone too far (get up, get up). Who do you think you are (get up, so we can finish this). Is this what you came for (get up, get up). Well this means war (get up, so we can finish this). And the only thing to save.

too bad,"Father's hands were lined with dirt. From long days in the field. And mother's hands are serving meals. In a cafe on Main Street. With mouths to feed. Just trying to keep clothing on our backs. And all I hear about is. How it's so bad, it's so bad. It's too bad, It's stupid. Too late, so wrong, so long. It's too bad that we had no time to rewind. Let's walk, let's talk. Let's talk. You left without saying goodbye. Although I'm sure you tried. You call the house from time to time. To make sure we're alive. But you weren't there. Right when I needed you the most. And now I dream about it. How it's so bad, it's so bad. It's too bad, It's stupid. Too late, so wrong, so long. It's too bad that we had no time to rewind. Let's walk, let's talk. Let's talk. Father's hands are lined with guilt. For tearing us apart. Guess it turned out in the end. Just look at where we are. Made it out, still got clothing on our backs. And now I scream about it. How it's so bad, it's so bad. It's too bad, it's stupid. Too late, so wrong, so long. It's too bad that we had no time to rewind. Let's walk, let's talk. Let's talk.

trying not to love you,"You call to me, and I fall at your feet. How could anyone ask for more?. And our time apart, like knives in my heart. How could anyone ask for more?. But if there's a pill to help me forget. God knows I haven't found it yet. But I'm dying to, god I'm trying to. Trying not to love you, only goes so far. Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart. Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor. And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for. Cause trying not to love you. Only makes me love you more. Only makes me love you more. And this kind of pain, only time takes away. That's why it's harder to let you go. And nothing I can do, without thinking of you. That's why it's harder to let you go. But if there's a pill to help me forget. God knows I haven't found it yet. But I'm dying to, god I'm trying to. Trying not to love you, only goes so far. Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart. Can't see the silver lining, down here on the floor. And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for. Cause trying not to love you. Only makes me love you more. So I sit here divided, just talking to myself. Was it something that I did?. Was there somebody else?. When a voice from behind me,. That was fighting back tears. Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear. Tonight I'm dying to tell you. That trying not to love you, only went so far. Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart. Now I see the silver lining, from what we've fighting for. If we just keep on trying, we could be much more. 'Cause trying not to love you, ohhhh. Trying not love you. Only makes me love you more. Only makes me love you more"
