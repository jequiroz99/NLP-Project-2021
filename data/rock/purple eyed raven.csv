brother,"Hey brother settle down, you've got to be alright. Find a shade, don't hesitate. have no fear of the night. You look so bad but you got your head on the clouds. We never hear you talk. but you feel a lot. I saw you turn yourself in a different man. You have no smile on your face. no one hold your hand. You look so serious, your thoughts are mysterious. Hold your pain inside, but I can see it in your eyes. You play the tough and dull type of guy. But I know how you are deep inside. Hey my brother you know I know ya well. You try to hide but I feel so damn proud of yourself. You use to stress but you don't need to. Everywhere you go you can always know that I got you. Listen close to what I have to say. Don't ever let the sadness take you away. You'll see the difference that love makes in your life. Don't ever forget that I will be always by your side"
i dare you,"Baby I call you but I know you are not alone. I know you don't believe. but I just wanna take you home. It is true. We both know we have a lot to do. Pretend is not my strongest point, I know that I'm not wrong. I can't stay in the same place as you. with all my clothes on. It is true. It's being a while since I'm dreaming of you. Look in my eyes. I dare you to say that you don't want me. I dare you to say that you don't need my body. You say you never noticed, You say that you don't care. I tell you to let your feelings out. I know you wont regret. It is you. The one I want to take me to the moon. Don't you try to understand me, I know you can't deny. The way you make me shake when you look into my eyes. It is you. The reason I'm awake and all of my mistakes. Look in my eyes. I dare you to say that you don't want me. I dare you to say that you don't need my body"
who you think you are,"Who are you to say I have to be alright?. Who are you to say I can't go out at night?. You're not half the man you think you are. That ain't a surprise to me. You always thought you'd go pretty far. But you ended up alone and afraid. Afraid of the dark. Who are you to say that I have all my rights?. Who are you to dare that I'm not gonna try?. Face me. You're not man enough when you're outta home. That's why you are so afraid. When you are alone. And you are alone. I am the one who decide. What I'm gonna do. It's up to me and not to you. You, you got to know. I'm not a thing. I was not made. To follow your rules. I won't be a shadow for you"
