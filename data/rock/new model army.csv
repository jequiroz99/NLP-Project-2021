And how to strip down a gun. ''cause we're the 51st state of america. Yeah, we're the 51st state of america. This is the 51st state of america. Our star-spangled union jack. Flutters so proud.

Yeah, we're the 51st state of america. This is the 51st state of america. Here in the land of opportunities,. Watch us revel in our liberty. Where you can say what you like. But it doesn't change anything. Because the corridors of power. They're an ocean away"
purity,"The rains move in eastwards, in waves of succession. Drawing lines of grey across the sky. With history just as close as a hand on the shoulder. In hunger and impatience we cry. The battle against corruption rages in each corner. There must be something better, something pure. And the call it is answered from the caves to the cities. Come the dealers of Salvation on Earth. We've seen the restless children at the head of the columns. Come to purify the future with the arrogance of youth. Nothing is as cruel as the righteousness of innocents. With automatic weapons and a gospel of the truth. Ch: Revolution for ever, succession of the seasons. Within the blood of Nature, all raised to rot and die. This purity is a lie. Now immaculate conception in sterilised laboratories. How the vanity goes on. Or in the message of the preacher with his morals and obsessions. The wars that we wage upon ourselves. Purity is a virtue, purity is an angel. Purity is for madmen to make fools of us all. So forgive yourself my friend, all this will soon be over. What happened here tonight is nothing at all. Ch: Revolution for ever . .. I will always see Brendan at that broken down piano. His fingers thick and red, shaking on the keys. Battered by the years of alcohol and working. Still playing with the faith that never leaves. So sit us down, buy us a drink, tell us a good story. Sing us a song we know to be true. I don't give a damn that I never will be worthy. Fear is the only enemy that I still know."
no rest,"Chorus:. Four o'clock in the morning and still we cannot sleep. Turning over turning round, twisting in our sweat. They say there is no rest for the wicked ones. Dear God what have we done?. There is no rest for the wicked ones. Dear God what is this evil that we've done?. Is it that we wanted more than you gave?. Why did you put us then in this smalltown grave?. Humility - is that what you want?. Why did you make us then the way you did?. Yes we have pride - is this our sin?. Is it the times that we've been out fighting?. Well I'll tell you all those times - we never really hurt anybody. Or is it that we were eating. While other people were starving?. Is this our crime?. Chorus:. Four o'clock in the morning and still we cannot sleep . .. Is it the times we laughed about it all."
sex (the black angel),"Look at my eyes - you know what it is. I want you, I want you. The way your body moves beneath that dress. And all the nights I've spent away alone in sleeplessness. It's a hunger that we can fill. Racing, racing. And every nerve tingles with it. I want you, I want you. You know the way that I can make you feel. Of all the faces in the crowd, there's only you. Pull down your hair a little. Open up your mouth a little. You're beautiful, you're the best. This feeling that you know oh so well. Your oldest friend from the fires, the fires of hell. And I want you now. Driving down. Driving down. Into the fires. Every stretch and move is like a dream. Eating, biting, scratching. And all there is, is these racing pulses. And the breathing. Forget all the lies that they gave to you. Believe in this 'cause how could this feeling not be true."
poison street,"We were singing in the rain - like we invented singing. There's a light in the sky from a million street lights. And we danced all the steps from all those old time movies. Rolling down the hill with laughing hearts. In Poison Street they guard the gates with bitter, bitter tongues. In Poison Street we'll laugh out loud until the shadows go melt away. And I love you now like I love you always ever. Kissing in the dark like a couple of kids. You gave me life, you gave me light and thunder. Like a blind man sees for the very first time. In Poison Street we'll go crashing through the walls that history made for us. In Poison Street we'll spring the traps and race away. Chorus:. So just a kick for this dark damned city of ours. And a kiss, yeah a kiss for you. And just a drink, a toast to the days to come. Now Poison Street won't break us any more. We were singing in the rain - like we wrote that song. There's a light in the sky from the streetlights all around. You gave me life, you gave me light and thunder. Like a man makes fire for the very first time."
better than them,"This is our town, this is Friday night. Dressed in our rags and our rage and our best. Piercing eyes looking for something - anything, anyone.. Stare across the floor as they begin to dance. Missing all the rhythms and the chosen right steps. And we laugh and we drink in our corner again. We're better than them. Divided we were born, divided we live. Divided we fall, divided we die. Still we tell ourselves over and over again. We're better than them. With our hunger and our hatred, we all walk this town. With our fear and our weakness - just holding on. With our doubt and our emptiness and this cold, cold frown. We've got to be so important, we'll put the whole damn world down. And we build the walls that we can hide behind. And our finest weapon is our poisoned pride. Here in this town where the jealousies burn. We're watching you. 'Cause truth is only what we need it to be. To bring us survival through each and every day. When nowhere is safe and nowhere is home - just be cool. And what was she wearing and what did he say?. Who goes with who and what did they do?. We tell ourselves over and over again."
here comes the war,"Today, as you listen to this song. Another 394,000 children were born into this world. They break like waves of hunger and desire upon these eroded shores. Carrying the curses of history and a history yet unwritten. The oil burns in thick black columns, the buzz saws echo through the forest floor. They shout give us our fair share, give us justice. Here comes the war. On a grey morning to the south of here. Two young men in makeshift uniforms peer into the misty light. And figures dart behind the trees. As a snap of rifle rounds echoes out across the fields. They hardly know their sacred mother tongue but they know their duty. To defend the flag hanging limp and bloody above the village church. While a thousand miles away, in a warehouse complex down by the river,. Young money men play paintball games. Here comes the war - put out the lights on the Age of Reason. So blow out the candle and tell us another of those great stories,. the ones about serial killers. Let dreams flow into savage times.. Do you hear the sirens scream across the city?. We've had three hot nights in succession - the riot season is here again. Dear Lord, lead us back into the Valley of the Shadow of Death,. Here comes the war. Did you think we were born in peaceful times?. Faster, faster, like a whirling dervish spinning round. Faster, faster, until the Centre cannot Hold. You screamed give us Liberty or give us Death. Now you've got both, what do you want next ?."
vagabonds,"We follow the taillights out of the city. Moving in a river of red. As the colours fade away from the dusky sunset. We roll for the darkness ahead. Chorus:. We are old, we are young, we are in this together. Vagabonds and children, prisoners forever. With pulses a-raging and eyes full of wonder. Kicking out behind us again. Night-time City Beat the radio is calling. The lost and lonely in vain. Out here we are running for the wide open spaces. The road-smell after the rain. Chorus:. We are old, we are young, we are in this together. Vagabonds and children, prisoners forever. With pulses a-raging and eyes full of wonder. Kicking out behind us again. And watching as a boy alone at the quayside. The ships loading cargo in the night. Their names all calling to faraway places. The years go past, the miles go by."
march in september,"There was always something holding you back. Some other world that was calling. Maybe in the mountains where you stretched your arms. Without fear of falling. They tried to bring you their love and fear. But you would never receive it. I tried to tell you you had everything that you need. But you would never believe it. So you tried to make family. But nothing was given. So you gave them your own blood. For theirs had been stolen. Yeah, you tried to make family. But nothing was given. So you gave them your own blood. And all of it stolen. You took the water from the wishing well. You never saw that you shouldn't. You tried to break all the bad in the world. You never saw that you couldn't. You can count up everything that you have. It never stops the craving. Ain't it always the ones that want to be saved. That do all of the saving. So you tried to make family. But nothing was given. So you gave them your own blood. For theirs had been stolen. Yeah, you tried to make family. But nothing was given. So you gave them your own blood. And all it stolen"
the charge,"Our history speaks in thunder from a thousand village halls. In blood and sweat and sacrifice, in honouring every call. So the forces gathered against the thorn a-piercing in their side. A brave new world is beckoning so the olden world must die.. In the offices of the city, at all the tables of oak and power. The snares are laid and baited for the approaching of the hour. A hundred justifications and the presses are ready to roll. The gateways to the nation they are firmly under control. Chorus:. On, on, on, cried the leaders at the back. We went galloping down the blackened hills. And into the gaping trap. The bridges are burnt behind us and there's waiting guns ahead. Into the valley of death rode the brave hundreds. We called for some assistance from the friends that we had known. But this is the 1980s and we were on our own. We never felt like heroes or martyrs to a cause. Just battle-weary soldiers in a bloody civil war. The massacre now is over and the order new enshrined. While a quarter of the nation are abandoned far behind. Their leaders offer the clich?words, so righteous in defeat. But no one needs morality when there isn't enough to eat. The unity bond is broken and the loyalty songs are fake. I'll screw my only brother for even a glimpse at a piece of the cake. We only cry in private here behind the shuttered glass. When we think of the charge of this brigade, the severing of the past. Chorus:. On, on, on, cried the leaders at the back. We went galloping down the blackened hills. And into the gaping trap. The bridges are burnt behind us and there's waiting guns ahead."
get me out,"Get up early every morning. Just to put your make up on. The wardrobe's full of useless clothes. Your winter coats are gone. The jackal pack is feeding. The motorway sweeps down. The council tries to bribe the rich. Just to stay in town. Ch:. Get me out. Get me out of this place. Get me out of this trap. Get me out of my brain. Ysidro down to Melbourne. The pressure starts to build. The bullets fly at random. When you least expect they will. Everybody feels guilty. So anyone can pay. I'm just surprised it doesn't happen every bloody day. Ch. So here come the nineties. The temperature is rising. I cannot seem to loose the stains. When I wash my hands. One world is rising,. One world is dying. And one has got it's precious head. Buried in the sand. Ch."
shot 18,"Thou shalt not kill - remember that?. You learnt it again and again when you were young. They said weapons have this safety catch. Your moral conscience tells you kid what's right, what's wrong. Well they make out like they're so surprised. But it's easy when you're civilised. Count to ten, close your eyes. The way it's always been . .. Shot 18. I think I was a bit surprised. I never knew I was so anaesthetised. And triggers pull so lightly and people die so easy. I never realised. Well I believe in common laws. I believe in even scores. I understand the rules of war. The way the slate is cleaned . .. Shot 18. Who wants another Christian martyr?. Who wants someone else's pain?. Who wants the world on their shoulder?. Who wants to have to cry in vain?. Who wants to have an open sore. Eating away deep inside you?. Who wants to torture themselves. When there's plenty eager to do it for you?. Well, years might heal all the scars. But I don't know if you feel like you have that time. And if I was the man that killed your father. And if I said I'm sorry, would that change your mind?. Well no one should be so surprised. That words don't pay for victims' lives. It's teeth for teeth, eyes for eyes. The way it's always been . .."
long goodbye,"Holed up in your little room, we talk for hour on empty hour,. pacing up and down between the walls that we have built ourselves.. No more with the long goodbye, I can't stand another tear;. I won't wait for the bell to toll - straight on for the days ahead,. straight on for the days ahead . .. You act as drowning, letting go the fingers one by one.. Come on, there's life beyond the tomb that we have built ourselves;. no more with the long goodbye . .. We don't even dare to look each other in the eyes,. or say whatever's on our minds . .. These crushing moments show the kind of people we've become,. seal betrayal with a kiss - and let it all be over, finished, done . .. It feels so good to kill the thing that stood between the truth and I. Make it fast and make it clean and let the blood run down."
waiting,"There's absolutely nothing on my mind. The television flickers in my eyes. Waiting, always waiting. Down at the bus station, doing time. We watch the world go passing by. Waiting, always waiting. It's all on tomorrow, don't worry today. Another year over but it's all okay. They told us of the Second Coming so we look to the sky. It's not a saviour we want, just someone else to crucify. Waiting, always waiting."
according to you,"Spring comes like a kiss upon the mouth. Soft and sweet with all the power of the earth behind. Broken fever and soaking sheets. Twisted round our bodies in the cool of the morning. Turning the cards over one by one. I see the faces staring back from across the ages. And everything tastes so strong, so strong. But you could never sense because. According to you. There isn't anything left to believe in. Because you never could see. That there is everything that we are receiving. We joined the battle between right and wrong. When we were all so young and certain. And now we pass the passions on. In the broken light streaming through the shredded curtain. They bring you scapegoats to sacrifice. Anything or anybody just to nail your pain to. They bring you promises you know are lies. So you feel betrayed in everything that you cling to so. According to you. There isn't anything left to believe in. Because you never could see. That there is everything that we are receiving. Come back to us all. Where there is everything that we are receiving"
i need more time,"Woke up this morning and my mouth was dry. The clouds were rushing downstream through the sky. I get a blind kind of panic that locks me inside. My mind numb and my heart racing. I am a man with too many reasons. On the road with too many signs. I play a deck with too many cards. Too many games of too many kinds. The seasons turned so fast and I'm moving too slow. I get blown off course, like everyone. I know I need more time, I need more time. To make good on the promises. I made to the world when the world was moving slower. Tick tock tick tock. As one by one the faces we love slide away into deep, deep waters. I've still so much to give, I've still so much to learn. I've still so much to love, still so much to burn. I need more time, I need more. To make good on the promises. I made to the world when the world was moving slower"
tomorrow came,"I was born in the spring. And raised as a child through the years. Of the great harvest. The last of the generation that blew away. The prison walls of the past. And we celebrated victory. Over the remains of the old order. By blasting into space, into the mountains. Into the forests and into the ice. We sang songs of love and freedom. And we vowed to protect the weak. Even as they were cast aside. For the follies of everlasting youth. Were to be our new religion. For each person's dream. Was to be made flesh and the world it was ours. As we slashed and we burned and laid waste to it all. To the glory and the vanity of rock and roll. Saying I want it all now. As our children stood and watched us in silence. Pray god they'll forgive us. So the seeds planted for the future. Withered even within our own lifetimes. For it was the ties we so hated and destroyed. That had made us strong. And the walls of every house now echo. With that old refrain. There must be more money, there must be more money. Remember all those songs of love and freedom. As if they were the same thing. Now we know they were not the same thing. They echo in empty beauty. Down through the boarded-up streets. To the sound of closing doors and locking of the gates. As we slashed and we burned and laid waste to it all. To the glory and the vanity of rock and roll. Saying I want it all now, give me more and more. As our children stood and watched us in silence. And now pray god they'll forgive us. They've started filming for the final scenes. We're still becoming what has already been. The stolen future and dissolving dream. Tomorrow never comes but tomorrow came. With the new day sun on our ageing skin. As we stand here naked. With our children's hungry eyes upon us. Pray god they'll forgive us"
a liberal education,"Take away our history. Take away our heroes. Take away our values. And leave us here with nothing. We were in the garden of Eden. Just as children mess around. We only leant against the tree. And the apple came tumbling down. You gave us what we asked for. But never what we wanted. We were only children. How could you have been so stupid. We went up to the steel walls. That guard the sacred town. We only whispered to ourselves. And the walls came tumbling down. We didn't want a victory. We just wanted to fight. But you wouldn't fight. You just gave in. You went and spoiled every game. You broke an everlasting chain. And nobody respects you for your weakness. Take away our idols. Take away our faith. Take away our hatred. And put us in this vacuum. Then say be yourself, please yourself. Express yourself some more. It's your right to do what you like. Because we can't really be bothered with you at all. We didn't want a victory. We just wanted to fight. But you wouldn't fight. You said it isn't nice to fight. You went and spoiled every game. You broke an everlasting chain."
frightened,"It's all out on the streets today but you, you've found a place to hide. Too busy with the ratrace, you pass by on the other side. Yours is the face of the brand new Britain with blinkers on your eyes. Find yourself position and cling on for dear life. You're so frightened, everybody's so frightened. The papers tell of rape and murder, everything that you want to hear. Bad tidings on the radio - you find a way to name your fear. So you never pick up hitchhikers, never talk to strangers. Believe the world outside your bolted door is evil. You're so frightened, everybody's so frightened.. You are just a victim of your own bad dreams. While people are the same as we've always been. But through the blindness in your eyes. For just one minute I see them shine. Love me . won't you love me? But they all turn away. You never fight for anything, you always turn your face away. And you never get involved in trouble let all evil have it's way. So as the girl screams in the street below, you turn up the television. Perhaps you'll see it on the news - well it's nothing to do with you. You're too frightened, everybody's so frightened."
51 st state,"51ST STATE. (Cartwright/NMA) 1979/85. Look out of your windows, watch the skies. Read all the instructions with bright blue eyes. We're W.A.S.Ps, proud American sons. We know how to clean our teeth and how to strip down a gun. We're the 51st state of America. Our star-spangled Union Jack flutters so proud. Over the dancing heads of the merry patriotic crowd. Tip your hat to the Yankee concurrence. We've got no leds under the bed with guns under our pillows. We're the 51st state of America. Here in the land of opportunities, watch us revel in our liberty. You can say what you like but it doesn't change anything. Because the corridors of power, there are an ocean wide. We're the 51st state of America"
sky in your eyes,"Between the chords of a song years ago. You saw a crack of light or was it a cause to follow?. You’ve been chasing ever since around these streets. For just the promise of a promise and nothing more to keep. You drove us like a crazy man through those narrow cobbled streets. You said ’there’s nothing to fear’ and we all smiled. Round and round in that little car while the city lay asleep. The city lay asleep. With sky in your eyes, shy in your eyes. The next day we went up to a ruined temple. high on a cliff above the opal sea. And watched as the angry storms chased around the bay. and suddenly the wind rose up and the thunder cracked. and you looked like you were home with your. weather-beaten face fixed in some kind of ecstasy. When the lightning hit the road just a few yards away. We all jumped up and shouted out but you never moved. Just stared ahead like you’d seen a ghost. So who was the ghost?. One part left behind, one part already gone. And one part standing here with sky in your eyes. With the sky in your eyes, with the sky in your eyes. If they won’t make you captain then you sail your own ship. With your own colours tied to the mast. Setting sail for the far side of anywhere. Beyond and behind your thousand yard stare. With the sky in your eyes, with the sky in your eyes"
heroes,"We are not children any more. The fists you made they are come bashing at your door. Your legacy is waiting in the wings. And there's something so familiar in the hunger that we bring. We don't want to be like you, don't want to live like you. Learn by our own mistakes, thank you. Forcing time and pushing through. Chorus:. You are not our heroes anymore. Dim the lights the time is come. Into the ring the father and the son. Sown in sweat and passion long ago. And now the blood on our hands is the same as our own. And the man has the skill and the man has the power. But the boy has the will to win and so much time. Chorus:. You are not our heroes anymore. If you knew then what you know now to be true. You never would have started this whole chain we're going through. And you love us now but you hate us still. And we hate you now but we love you still. Chorus:. You are not our heroes anymore. You are not my mother, you are not my father."
225,"She stares at the screen, at the little words of green. Tries to do remember what to do next. There's a trace of frustration that crosses her face. Searching for the key she should press. And I would help her if I only know how. But these things are a mystery to me too. And it seems that the Corporate eyes they are watching. She fears for her job and the moments are passing. I stare at her nametag and I think to myself. Both you and I, we never asked for any of this. So let's take a walk up past the chemical works. Where the sky turns green at night. And we'll talk about getting away from here. Some different kind of life. But even in the freshest mountain air. The jet fighters practise overhead. And they're drilling these hills for uranium deposits. And they'll bury the waste for our children to inherit. And though this is all done for our own benefit,. I swear we never asked for any of this. This golden age of communication. Means everyone talks at the same time. And liberty just means the freedom to exploit. Any weakness that you can find. Turn off the TV just for a while. Let us whisper to each other instead. And we'll hope that the Corporate ears do not listen. Lest we find ourselves committing some kind of treason. And filed in the tapes without rhyme, without reason. While they tell us that it's all for our own protection,."
my country,"Tell all the people who believe what they read in the press. Tell all the folk who stare from behind suburban walls. The enemy is not some nation far across the sea. The enemy is with us every single breathing day. Chorus:. So yes, I will fight for my country. The land that I love so well. Yes - for justice, a land fit for all our futures. Yes, I will fight for my country. The land that I love so well. Hear the voices of our history echo all around. Fight all the ones who divide us rich against poor. Fight all the ones who divide us white against black. Fight all the powers who want their missiles in our earth. Fight all the people who would lead us into war. No rights were ever given to us by the grace of God. No rights were ever given by some United Nations clause. No rights were ever given by some nice guy at the top. Our rights they were bought by all the blood. And all the tears of all our. Grandmothers, grandfathers before. For all the folk who gave their lives for us. For all the folk who spit out - never say die. For all the fires burning on our highest hills. For all the people spinning tales tonight. Fight all the powers who would abuse our Common Laws."
no greater love,"There's storm clouds amassing over in the west up above the moor. The city shines in grey, mills closing down on the valley floor. All you can do here is survive, grit your teeth and just stay alive. And never understand. The young ones they dance with fire in their hearts until the years go by. And older, defeated they stare in their beer at closing time. No greater love could there ever be. Than what I feel for you, what you gave to me. You saved my life from this. While kings are in their counting houses, people just wait here in silent rows. They spat and they jeered in a last desperate fear as they watched us go. Remember how we turned and ran. Heads into the wind running hand in hand. We laughed until we cried."
125 mph,"I'm heading north, I'm heading home doing 125. I close my eyes and count to ten - Ha ha, I'm still alive. Perfect, perfect tunnel vision, razor sharp and racing, racing. These moments, immortal,. No one touches this. Chorus:. These things they flow as blood must flow. Dust to dust and wind must blow. Nothing that I need to know or ever understand. These things they flow as blood must flow. Dust to dust and wind must blow. You can die before you get old. But me, I'm going to live forever. The music plays, the party swings, the gaiety walls come closing in. I catch your eye, you take my hand - out into the night we run. Dancing down those dead-end streets - howling at the moon like little kids. Out on the grass at the top of the hill, your breath tastes sw . .. Chorus:. These things they flow as blood must flow . .. And if I say I hate this place, don't take it as personal. And just because I want to kill somebody doesn't mean to say that I will. And I don't think that that makes me crazy and anyway I'm way past caring. There's a ride leaves out of here at nine. What do you say?. Chorus:."
1984,"The vans they come in convoys now, stealing through the dawn. Silent in the countryside in the hills up to the north. There's road blocks on the Meden bridge. There's click, click clicking on the phone. They're sealing off our villages, sealing off our homes. This ain't some tin-pot story arriving from a distant shore. But our own sweet, green and pleasant land in 1984. Her father crossed the battle lines in the first months of the war. She frowns down at the soup kitchen - she doesn't have a father anymore. It's cold in the early mornings, standing with your mates. Staring at the thick blue line armed and ready at the gates. This ain't some tin-pot story arriving from a distant shore. But our own sweet, green and pleasant land in 1984. The servants of our great nation. Have lied in the name of us all. While the officers of peace and order. Are busy breaking every law. There's hundreds on trumped-up charges. Hundreds on the streets. The future of our villages. Sown with bitter seeds. And hatred starts to rumble where there was no hate before. In our own sweet green and pleasant land in 1984. Nobody wanted to see the blood. As the blue lights flash through in the night. But all the words fell on deaf ears. And now the blind frustration bites. Two nations under one crown divided more and more."

You just gave in. You went and spoiled every game. You broke an everlasting chain. And nobody respects you for your weakness. Take away our idols. Take away our faith. Take away our hatred. And put us in this vacuum. Then say be yourself, please yourself. Express yourself some more. It's your right to do what you like. Because we can't really be bothered with you at all. We didn't want a victory. We just wanted to fight. But you wouldn't fight. You said it isn't nice to fight. You went and spoiled every game. You broke an everlasting chain."
according to you,"Spring comes like a kiss upon the mouth. Soft and sweet with all the power of the earth behind. Broken fever and soaking sheets. Twisted round our bodies in the cool of the morning. Turning the cards over one by one. I see the faces staring back from across the ages. And everything tastes so strong, so strong. But you could never sense because. According to you. There isn't anything left to believe in. Because you never could see. That there is everything that we are receiving. We joined the battle between right and wrong. When we were all so young and certain. And now we pass the passions on. In the broken light streaming through the shredded curtain. They bring you scapegoats to sacrifice. Anything or anybody just to nail your pain to. They bring you promises you know are lies. So you feel betrayed in everything that you cling to so. According to you. There isn't anything left to believe in. Because you never could see. That there is everything that we are receiving. Come back to us all. Where there is everything that we are receiving"
adrenalin,"We were in the corner, the Clanduff by the door. On opposite sides of the dance hall, staring across the floor. The lights go out, the fists fly in, it's the usual Friday scene. Because adrenalin is the strongest drug that there has ever been. There's this funny little bloke asking all these questions writing down what we say. So we wound him up like a clockwork dog and we watched him trotting away. Two weeks later there's a feature in the paper called 'Britain's Urban Shame'. It's got the teenage thugs of the new estates with our photographs and names. Ch: So we cut our hair to prove it. And we wore the clothes to prove it. And we armed ourselves to prove it. And we chose our place to prove it. And we danced that way to prove it. And we made ourselves believe it. Until all the world believed it. Until even you believed it. And I was just a little part but I felt the wheels turning. And these are all just little flames but the whole damn city's burning. Now that we were famous they watched everything that we did. We were the villains of the neighbourhood, heroes to all the kids. And even when that old bloke died we pretended that nothing was changed. We just broke the silence with some stupid song and went on with the stupid game. Ch: Yes, we cut our hair to prove it...."
afternoon song,"Time passes slow - fields stretch out across open acres. Time passes slow - the giant steps of mankind touch us so little in the great lands. Our little storm whirls away out across calm wide oceans. In this sacred breath, you and I falling for ever and ever and ever. The news peoples' dull voices bring the distant tidings of great disasters,. politicians speaking in some solemn tone, the crisis of a different world,. the panic of the thousands, the destiny of millions - so far away. Time passes slow - sunlight sparkles on rippling waters. And the trees they sway - I don't believe in the things that I can't see. Our little storm whirls away out across calm wide oceans."
aimless desire,"I was working shift on the six o'clock, quiet in the pale dawn.. Found a bird caught in the machinery - set it free and watched it go. Quit the job that very day, and flew into the sky. Just following after this aimless desire, this awful desire, this worthless desire.. Now I've found causes and I've found families, but nothing ever lasts;. I've known people I'd die for - if only they had asked.. Where I'm from is not my home, and neither's where I'm bound;. Just following after this aimless desire, worthless desire. So tonight beneath the bridge where the fires burn, God, take the freedom back,. deliver me from the aimless desire, the worthless desire. And chimera she waits, and I have still got this hole in me."
all of this,"There's a sentry in a uniform to watch the VIPs along the hall. Strategical discussions taking place behind the steel plated wall. The agents issue the statements to the waiting press who circulate the words. Justification, propaganda, Western foreign policy across the world. Chorus:. In the name of the people. All of this is done in the name of the people. They read their books and study hard, cigarettes lit in the claustrophobic gloom. West of the University Road, the world outside is ghost-like in the room. Frustrated and impatient and intelligence sharp and twisted like a child. Death is an aphrodisiac now, the fuses on the table slowly wired. Chorus:. In the name of the people. All of this is done in the name of the people. Hold me tight, hold me fast. Standing here on the wrong side. Of this bullet-proof glass. There are no questions left for us to ask. It's soldiers night at the discotheque, pick up a girl and drink to home afar. Spending money like water on the watered drinks available at the bar. The ones who never were given much, never asked much of anything in recall. But there's a black bag in the corner and it doesn't belong to anyone here at all. Chorus:. In the name of the people."
ambition,"Stepping out onto the stage the smalltown star tonight. Flexes out for fame and fortune into the lights. The way she tears into the heart makes me realise. That I never understood hatred until I looked into those eyes. She cries, ""No one's going to talk down to me again. No one's ever going to patronise me again. I'm going to get out of this town, steal myself a crown. I'm going to get myself some power. If it's the last thing that I do"". Heading out of Bradford with a ticket on the train. And a faith as hard as steel and as sharp as any pain. Gets pictures in the papers smiling oh so good. While she lies in bed with racing dreams hot as blood. Because love will make you happy and love will keep you warm. And love will build a cushion to keep you safe from harm. But hate will drive you onwards, hate will drive you upwards. Till you can get back all the bastards. Who ever tried to put you down. And when she's gone forever, please don't lay her down to rest. In a quiet little churchyard along with all the rest. Throw a great big party to remember that she lived. Give her headlines on the TV to remember who she is. 'Cause no one's ever going to talk down to her again. No one's ever going to patronise her again. She's going to get out of this town, steal herself a crown. She's going to get herself some power. If it's the last thing that she does. If it's the one thing that she does."
angry planet,"I live on an angry planet. Amidst the crowds and the endless noise. In the debris of the broken families. And the cracks in the grand designs. And all the angry gods are back. Gathering strength as the continents collide. Some live by the bloody sword. And die by the bloody sword, some by beauty and desire. I live in the shadow of the great volcano. I live by the good soil and the fire. And of course I know. That the days are numbered. But we will go down to the wire. And the pressure moves the mountains. Seven billion and counting. As the monkey tribes advance across the bleak terrain. All sown with seed of mono-culture. Wind and rain and revolution coming. But we know it isn't personal. We just live on an angry planet. They say that we're all kings and queens. In the new world except for those who aren't. They say we can follow our dreams. To the very top of the tree except for those who can't. They say that the meek shall inherit the earth. Except that they shan't. And the pressure moves the mountains. Seven billion and counting. As the monkey tribes advance. All in a rush of blood, the jet stream blowing. High above the zombie hordes. All banging war drums, raising flags. As the pressure moves the mountains. Seven billion now and counting. As the monkey tribes advance across the ruined land. All sown with seed of mono-culture. War and rain and revolution coming. But I know it isn't personal - I just live on an angry planet"
apocalypse dream,"I went up to the mountain, apocalypse dreams in my head. There was fire upon the horizon but it was just the sunrise turning red. Maybe it's time, maybe it's time . .. Each night I walk to the edge of the city out to where the darkness begins. Made a promise out here a long time ago and I've been waiting ever since. Maybe it's time, maybe it's time . .. My world has become an empty place. Of great, wide landscapes and weird painted skies. Strange patterns and islands of light. And people move as shadows never touching at all. I've never been afraid to die, maybe scared to live. I've been across every ocean just chasing after storms. My crew long dead or deserted now and the seas nothing but calm."

archway towers,"Rolling up tab ends that the baby's collected. Waiting for the number that clicks on the wall.. It's open season on the weak and the feeble. Their meagre ambitions, their impotent fury. There's bullet proof glass in case there is trouble. No doors in the building between this side and that side.. I've tried to wrestle some unbalanced nightmare. Tell myself over that I don't really live here. But the boys run away leaving blood on the pavement. And a little crowd gathered to watch you pick yourself up. Joining the queue at the video library. To watch ninety five minutes of simulated torture. The conference hall rings to the standing ovation. The people in blue ties rise from the podium. Crazy with power, blinded by vision."
bad old world,"Dear Justin, I know it's been a long time. Remember all those nights we spent sitting up talking in your front room. About leaving this worn out world and starting again far away in a better place. Well that's where I am now - but still thinking about you. Chorus:. I'm never going back there. I'm never going back to the bad old world. I was travelling with Laurel way up on the north coast. She's got family living up here in a nearby town. We found a piece of land that looks out towards. the north sea islands across the bay. And the sun is shining on the water today as I look out of our front door. Chorus:. I'm never going back there. I'm never going back to the bad old world. Are you still scared of the future? Well, that doesn't surprise me. You could come up and stay here a while, back off from the killing wheel. I used to think it was me who'd somehow sold out. or given in on some almighty cause,. But what difference would it make? It feels good to be out here.. Chorus:. I'm never going back there."
ballad,"When they look back at us and they write down their history. What will they say about our generation?. We're the ones who knew everything and still we did nothing. Harvested everything, planted nothing.. Well we live pretty well in the wake of the goldrush. Floating in comfort on waves of our apathy. Quietly gnawing away at Her body. Until we mortgage the future, bury our children. Storehouses full with the fruits we've been given. We send off the scrag-ends to suckle the starving. But still we can't feed this strange hunger inside. Greedy, restless and unsatisfied.. I was never much one for the great ""Big Bang"" theory. Going out in a blaze of suicidal glory. Not foolish and brave, these leaders of ours. Just stupid and petty, unworthy of power;. Just a little leak here and a small error there. Another square mile poisoned forever. A series of sad and pathetic little fizzles. And out go the lights, never to return.. The affair it is over, the passion is dead. She stares at us now with ice in Her eyes. But we turn away from these bitter reproaches. And take up distractions to forget what we're doing. I stand on these hills and I watch Her at night. A thousands square miles, a million orange lights. Wounded and scarred, She lies silent in pain. Raped and betrayed in the cold acid rain. And I wish and I wish. We could start over again. Yes I wish and I wish."
ballad of bodmin pill,"Smash glass against the wall. Curse the music on the radio. that the neighbours play.. Door slams, she turns her head. Watches through the window as he pulls away. Funny how your racing brain drives you so mad. When all the while you feel so numb. Too old to be clean. far too young to be broken. Like an army we come. Cut back, left behind. I watched you self-destructing oh so many times. Shot down, once again. Sitting in a chair crying. what am I going to do with my life?. Just learn to hide. the way that you really feel. Never let them know that you're scared. But understand that you're not. the special only one. Watch us now, watch us real close. How we all dance with this fire. 'cause it's all that we know. And as the spotlight turns toward us,. we all try our best to show. We are lost we are freaks, we are crippled,. we are weak. We are the heirs,. we are the true heirs, to all the world. Let's go build a fire down on the empty beach. when the waves are crashing high. White heat purify, as the sparks fly up. into the great black sky. Sacrifice these crutches to the crackling flames. Stand as silhouettes against the dawn. It's far too late to try to sleep now,. seems I'm never tired any more. I want to dance with this fire. 'cause it's all that I know. We are lost we are freaks. And we try our best to show"
ballad2,"Crackle in the lines so far away, the late night DJ starts to play. That sacred song goes phasing through the airwaves of the night. Beyond the lonely light house beam, beyond these black and restless dreams. She'll wake before I go to sleep in the silver morning light. Ch: Carry these words over the ocean, carry these words over the sea. Tell her that I'm thinking of her - does she ever think of me?. Out in the drizzle of the dirty rain, I walk the square alone again. Reflections of the neon shines in colours on the ground. Beyond the woods and the open fields, the long and empty highway miles. She lies beneath these very skies, sleeping sound. Ch: Carry these words over the ocean, carry these words over the sea. Tell her that I'm thinking of her - does she ever think of me?. And the promises that we made - and the place we loved so well. The storm clouds of her eyes, a sadness thunder never still."
bd7,"Well the warm wind blew through the 60s. But it didn't blow much round here. Disappointment hidden in the jutting chin - 'we didn't want it all anyway'. White paint daubed on a gritstone wall, the words of the prophets told. And we smiled to ourselves every time we walked by. The junction up on All Saints Road. 'It's a mean old scene'. It doesn't do much for business or the paper-crack West-End dream. The council took it down every now and again. But it was written up fresh and clean. Stick your head above the parapet. They're going to arrange to put you down. Bad stories in the clubs at night, scrap metal in a rusting town. 'It's a mean old scene'. BD7 and October evenings of endless rain. The backed-up storm drains bubbling and hissing. And the cats all running for shelter, fur matted and drenched. Twenty-nine years on and nothing's changed. Though in the end they took it down stone by stone. But we're still laughing all the way to the edge. Of our beloved, unredeemable, desperate town."
before i get old,"I'm going to kiss the girls, make them cry. Live too fast, still not die - before I get old. I'm going to see you raised above this place. Watch the moments shine upon your face. Before I get old. I'll watch the sun set over every sea. From every city wall, every mountain peak. Before I get old. The Northern Lights and the Southern Cross. The harvests and the miles of dust. And the blowing wind across the world. So wrap this coat around yourself. And leave what's done behind. There's so much left for us to do. And yet there's so little time. I'm going to pull the fences to the ground. Watch the twisted towers come crumbling down. And start again. I want to be a hero and a villain and a father and a son. Take care of my body and abuse it still. Until everything goes numb. So let's make this dance and never fear. That there's any real reason why we're all here."
believe it,"In the unlit room with my head in my hands. The walls between us now seem unscalable. I cannot control anything. There are weapons down beside your bed. And every night I count them all. Chorus:. Is this where we've come to? I don't believe it. After everything that we've been through - I don't believe it. Take a look around here - I don't believe it. I look into my own sweet heart - I don't believe it. Oh how they talk about us when we're far away. Behind their frigid eyes they know more than they ever say. They only tell you the truth when they get drunk enough. It's a town of cornered animals, teeth bared - out of control. Chorus:. Is this where we've come to? I don't believe it. After everything that we've been through - I don't believe it. Take a look around here - I don't believe it. I look into my own sweet heart - I don't believe it. And every night I clench my teeth and fail to get to sleep. I cannot bear the stillness drawn across the surface of the world. I have never learned to throw the first punch. Perhaps the more you know the more you get scared. In the end you left on your mission to find a reason for all this pain. And how I wish I'd gone with you over and over and over again. Chorus:. Is this where we've come to? I don't believe it. After everything that we've been through - I don't believe it. Take a look around here - I don't believe it."
betcha,"We know we can hurt each other real bad. You know my weak spots, I know yours. How come we egg each other on and on. Like battered boxers staying the course?. How come we never ever come to blows. When we want to break each other's necks?. How come we stab each other with these words. When all we really want is sex?. Why can't we talk it out. Why can't we fight it out. Why can't we kiss and and go to bed. The seething angers burns around the room. The carefully poisoned arrows fly. And in the morning dirty tired hearts."
better than them,"This is our town, this is Friday night. Dressed in our rags and our rage and our best. Piercing eyes looking for something - anything, anyone.. Stare across the floor as they begin to dance. Missing all the rhythms and the chosen right steps. And we laugh and we drink in our corner again. We're better than them. Divided we were born, divided we live. Divided we fall, divided we die. Still we tell ourselves over and over again. We're better than them. With our hunger and our hatred, we all walk this town. With our fear and our weakness - just holding on. With our doubt and our emptiness and this cold, cold frown. We've got to be so important, we'll put the whole damn world down. And we build the walls that we can hide behind. And our finest weapon is our poisoned pride. Here in this town where the jealousies burn. We're watching you. 'Cause truth is only what we need it to be. To bring us survival through each and every day. When nowhere is safe and nowhere is home - just be cool. And what was she wearing and what did he say?. Who goes with who and what did they do?. We tell ourselves over and over again."
between dog and wolf,"Late afternoon in winter time on the edge of the city. The incinerator towers are breathing out into the cold. The birdes are making spirals high above the neon skyline. Across the drifting swirl of charcoal and gold. Islands in silver seas as the land falls into shadow. These are more real for me than all that I left behind. And if I could only choose one moment to last forever. I would be here with you. Between dog and wolf. Between water and wine. Between wine and blood. From the black and icy river's edge to the ressurrection garden. We were in the arms of something that was unfolding. I close my eyes and see wild horses coming from the sky. Narcotic dreams and miracles descending. Silence my silver tongue and meet me somewhere deeper. Everything's how it feels - is what you were trying to say. And if I could only choose one moment to last forever. I would be here with you in the place between dog and wolf. Where the breath is deeper and the lights are diamond. Where the blood runs faster and the taste is stronger. And the night uncoils moving around us. Come, take what you want in the place. Between dog and wolf. Between water and wine. Between wine and blood"
big blue,"So now let us sing of what remains. There shall be stillness in our hearts. There shall be a sweetness in our lives, bye and bye.. There's a beach I know at the edge of the world,. mist rising up from the breaking waves. towards the cliffs, as green as god.. We'll be flying for the sake of flying, singing for the sake of singing,. looking back down on the lonely world - dive, dive, diving down. Into the big blue we shall lose ourselves, gone are the doubts. and the fear of falling - hate is a curse lifted from our shoulders,. we never meant it in the way they thought.. If we hold our nerve, they will travel right over us;. they'll be going so fast they will never even notice us.. We'll be flying for the sake of flying - singing for the sake of singing,. looking back down on the lonely world - dive, dive, dive. Into the big blue we shall lose ourselves, gone are the doubts. and the fear of falling - hate is a curse lifted from our shoulders,. we never meant it in the way they thought.. Time to die, and die, and die again; doors closing in empty houses;. time to roll, and roll, and roll again - and all I hear is the diesel roaring.. Just like a people put to flight, all blown out in the endless dust storms,. into the West and the rolling hills, to dive, dive, dive again and."
bittersweet,"Once upon a time it was easy. Everything kind of fell into place. Now this feeling won't leave me. We lost the power and we lost the pace. It's staring straight between the eyes. Something isn't right. The harder we try the more we realise. Something isn't right. So bittersweet, this whole thing, so bitter sweet. Caught in this struggle for power. Where only blood ever tastes sweet. Everything else is so sour. The numbing failures and defeats. The loner's not a western hero. With nerves of steel and heart of gold. But here alone in the disco - icy cold. But there's always another morning. We're never dead till the last breath."
bloodsports,"There are boxes packed with bullets, there are crates all stacked with boxes. There are uniforms and hardware, there are meals all wrapped in plastic. Through the night the ships are loading, every night these ships are loading. Beneath the glare of the burning floodlights and the dancing of the swarmed mosquitoes. And into the fire and the blood red sun the old and rich still send the young men. Into a world of twisted steel and the acrid smell of metal burning. And on the streets of hometown now, we watch each other as if we’re strangers. But say it loud, scream it loud: I am not at war. He says: this body I have been given shall be returned unto its maker. Beneath my clothes these secrets hidden, the sacrifice that I have to offer. By the checkpoint there are soldiers and the cypress branches waving. And the light is hard as glass and the sky is blue and cool and waiting. And into the fire and the blood red sun the old and rich still send the young men. Into a world of twisted steel and the acrid smell of metal burning. And on the streets of hometown now, we watch each other as if we’re strangers. But say it loud, scream it loud: I am not at war. These stupid empty words could all be written on the cold pale skin. Of the dead laid out in shallow graves along the road of bombed out palm trees. And in the corners of the bars and cafes, in every town, in every nation. There are these blood-sports on the TVs and the loaded toneless voices. There are cameras by the gravesides and in the executioners’ chambers. There are cameras high above us to guide the missiles down from the heavens. And into the fire and the blood red sun the old and rich still send the young men. Into a world of twisted steel and the acrid smell of oil burning. And on the streets of hometown now, we watch each other just like strangers. But say it loud, scream it loud: I am not at war"
brave new world,"The office lines are busy and the girls are working hard. Tonight they'll be out clubbing with their boyfriends busy wishing they were. Gentlemen please take your seats, there's champagne in the boardroom. Let's drink a toast to prosperity, tell the waiting pressmen that. No, there's nothing wrong here, nothing at all. Remember locking all the doors before you went to bed. Then waking with those racing dreams ringing round your head. The future's full of shining cars on shining tarmac roads. Cutting through the wasted years and all the old abandoned tracks and. No, there's nothing wrong here, nothing at all. So keep that smile on your face, have a drink to help you sleep at night. They got what they desired - We're passive in their brave new world. We are not young and beautiful, we are not rich and bold. And we are not your people who bought the dreams you sold. And we hate your smiling faces and we hate what you have done. We hate your patronising and we hate your cold blue eyes. And we all feel this raging and we all feel the same. This crazy blinding fury that we cannot explain. And we all see reflections in our lover's eyes. We live with so few troubles but with so many, many lies and."
brave new world 2,"The thick black smoke comes rising up, silent in these dreams. There's faces leering through the haze, that ripples in the heat. And words are just some place to hide, a wall that we can run behind. When truth is itching, twisting, turning, but locked away deep down inside. No, there's nothing wrong here, nothing at all. We sat up talking late last night, trying to make some sense. But we were just skirting round with clever words. And all the things that we pretend. There's guard dogs straining at the leash, with the soldiers standing by. Staring into empty space beyond the twisted wire. No, there's nothing wrong here, nothing at all. So when this nightmare's over, will you just rock me back to sleep."
breathing,"Into a new place, pulling myself back. Tasting smoke and blood and burning in my lungs. I’m lying on my left side, I don’t know if I can move. But I can hear myself breathing, I can hear myself breathing. Then into a new place - this is where I die. And all the noise is gone and there is only calm. Deep beneath the city – waiting for the fire. Any second now…. But the fireball never comes and so we turn back to ourselves. I can hear us all breathing, I can hear us all breathing. In the pitch black tunnels with all the weight above. I can hear us all breathing, I can hear us all breathing. Then into a new place – shouting men with torches and tools. Stumbling from the wreckage in a starlight of shattered glass. The wounded and the shell-shocked, the blackened and the burned. I can hear us all breathing, I can hear us all breathing. Climbing ever upwards like the rising of the dead. I can hear us all breathing, I can hear us all breathing. I can hear myself breathing, I can hear myself breathing. I can hear us all breathing, I can hear us all breathing"
brother,"It's been a long dry season in tinderbox town. And the ghetto cars go cruising up and down and round and round. With tinted windows and the screech of tires. Poverty likes to ride in the best disguise. The boys get bored, set fire to the sheds at the end of my street. The thick black smoke rises up into the dusk. Sirens scream out across the hills. Turn into the close as the boys all swagger.. I've got no quarrel with you brother. But the war is getting closer. Down at the Union there we stood. And embraced like brothers should. The fire catches when your back is turned. And now we watch as the city burns. And now we watch as the city burns. We used to joke about the colour of our skins. We used to joke about the names of God. But now the racist cops come round. Put your cousin up against the wall. A little crowd gathers round and takes up sides. The white trash come out of their doorways and mutter. There's a macho stand off with sullen faces all around. And all the middle ground is washing away. And no one really wants it there anyway. It's a time of pack dogs brother. And the war's getting closer. Down at the Union there we stood. And embraced like brothers should. The fire catches when your back is turned. And now we watch as the city burns. And now we watch as the city burns. And I, I accuse you, you want so much. But you give nothing of yourself. And I, I believe you, you want so much."
burning season,"I'm sick of the sight of some snot-nosed kid. Cutting a swathe through the age of deconstruction. Picking at the sores of the dying beast. And winning all the prizes for imagination. I don't know what we've got to lose. But I see the statues beginning to fall. The deisel's turning, the moon is high. Ch: What the hell are we waiting for?. I see the smoke on the blue horizon. I smell the fires of the burning season. What the hell are we waiting for?. I'm sick of the ironies piled up high. In this sneery culture with its knowing smile. I'm sick of the sermons from the Church of Unbelief. All fat, empty and anaesthetised. The emperor's out riding naked again. I can't believe we're still playing this tired old game. Let's get out there and cut him down. Ch: What the hell are we waiting for? . .. On a smoky yellow sunset, I'm sitting at the wheel. As the traffic crawls by on the ten-lane. Bumper to bumper, nowhere to nowhere into the next millenium. I see you drowning in a sea of rage. Let's go back and get the ones who put you down here. The highway's jammed up with disinformation. And the anaesthetic dealers are selling by the million."
bury the hatchet,"Bury the hatchet with a smile and a curse. The world is big enough for both of us. The pack's been shuffled now - we've got different hands. There's different enemies for both of us now. There's no one round here who remembers those times. When we were little kings of our own different sides. Was I the punk who stole your thunder. Or was it all just the other way round?. Chorus:. Now it's gone, done, the feud is over. Funny how vendettas just turn into a bore. Gone, done, the feud is over. I really can't be bothered anymore. Bury the hatchet with a smile and a curse. The world is big enough for both of us. But oh how that bitching was fun while it lasted. Until I got to realise no one really cared. Chorus:. Now it's gone, done, the feud is over. Funny how vendettas just turn into a bore. Gone, done, the feud is over. I really can't be bothered anymore. It's such a waste of my time, thinking of you. And all the stuff that I hear which may or may not be true. I never did like you, probably never will. But I bet you can live with that fact pretty well. People get to drinking, they get sentimental. Maybe I'm a bastard human after all. Bury the hatchet with a smile and a curse. The world is big enough for both of us. The pack's been shuffled now - we've got different hands"
carrying on,"My friend, is it still ringing in your ears. Through all those blessed and poisoned years. You will still say I was wrong. But you'll miss me when I'm gone. Carrying on, carrying on, carrying on. And now I watch the falling of the leaves. We live by little deaths such as these. And when everything is changed. I'll embrace it once again. Carrying on, carrying on, carrying on. The empty roads we travelled now are filled. With all the brave processions of desperate will. All looking to burn out in glory. And you know just how that feels. But I've made my choice for better or for worse. And it's everything I know and it's nothing much at all. Carrying on, carrying on, carrying on. You will still say I was wrong. But you'll miss me when I'm gone."
changing of the light,"The sky is broken in grey and in silver. The wind blows clean. We watch the shadows chase across the hillside. And out to sea. You and I, we're nearly full circle. It's just a touch away. And all the seeds we've sown in a lifetime. They'll come good some day. Pain is what you live with. And try to change the subject. In the dark the hands reach out. But I still feel the wonder. As the sky turns to fire. A catching in the heart. Standing between the worlds. In the changing of the light. Across the desert the wise men travelled. Following a dream. I see the same star shining above us."
chinese whispers,"Such a sensitive opinion in one so young. Would you like to know about everything that we've done. You believe what you read in the printed lies. But you won't believe the evidence of your own eyes. And yes I've done a lot of things that you'd probably call a crime. But I don't feel guilty for anything. All the tongues waggle but we just smile. That'll keep the little buggers going for a while. I live within natural justice, I understand nature's law. But as for your Christian morals . .. Oh, how you love this, how you love it. You go out and you find it. How you love it, how you love it. Such horror, oh such a farce, a little bit of broken glass. You should think yourself lucky that this was done."
christian militia,"There's a witch hunt coming, screaming out on it's rebirth. There's a crusade coming, Hellfires back here on earth. See the light in their eyes shine, listen to their words like swords. The Christian militia is marching now. There's a witch hunt coming, born out of all the American fears. There's a new purge coming, an inquisition for all of us here. Hold onto your sanity as best you can. While some Hitler claims to speak for the Son of Man. The Christian militia is marching now. Hatred makes the adrenaline flow. Stir up the fire watch it grow. Everybody loves a righteous cause. Old lives forgotten in holy wars. Everything forgotten in holy wars. There's a nightmare coming, shut up your doors close your mind. There's a nightmare coming - Born Again, born again blind. The girls show the way, then show us their legs. With American showbiz razzmatazz. With sex in one hand and a gun in the other, Christ returns. The right-wing respectable clampdown clan. Find their figure head in a holy man. Here come the Christians an hysterical mob. Worshipping the Devil in the name of God."
courage,"We walk every morning in silence. Past the mills on Whetley Lane. Where the lights went out for the very last time. And they never came on again. The spokesman all shred crocodiles tears. In the glory of the News at Ten. But the proudest eyes are long since dry. And they're never going to cry again. Ch: Dear Friend, I salute your courage and I toast to your health. And I wish you all the luck in the whole wide world. May you never be broken like they say you will. Waking up sudden from a nightmare - you were walking the line in pain. With a shaven head to the slaughterhouse and you never came back again. But she took me in her arms and she held me. Close tight for a minute or two. And we laughed and smiled and closed our eyes. Slept again thinking of you. And the way that it is, the way that it really is. With the money talking and a scapegoat lover. With the painted face of a scolding mother. And I salute your courage and I toast to your health. And I wish you all the luck in the whole wide world. May you never be broken like they say you will be. Now lost in time, cut off from history."
curse,"Another foggy night in hometown. Cruising the backstreet pubs with a friend or two. I guess we were laughing how we made it through the bad old days. When across the bar I caught a glimpse of you. Sometimes they ask me why I don't sit with you. I guess they'll never understand. I don't need to have my heart broken another time. Or to have to shake your useless wasted hand. So tell me - what do you dream about?. And tell me - how do you shut it all out?. And how do you live with yourself now?. And I hope that she's really happy now. Now she's got her cake and she went and ate him too. Heads down, out on 47 Poison Street. With all the ghosts just sitting there with you. Beethoven - he was a deaf man. And Jesus Christ was a Jew. But of all those little twists of irony -. My favourite one is you. And if our eyes ever have to meet for more than just one second. Then if you weren't already there, I would tell you to go to hell. But if I spent my whole damn life trying to think of a curse for you. It would never be as bad as the curse that you dealt to yourself. So tell me - what do you dream about?. And tell me - how do you shut it all out?. And how do you live with yourself now?. What do you dream about?. And how the hell do you shut it all out?."
dawn,"I get so angry and helpless. There’s no way back from this spiral. Something always has to give. And nothing is given for nothing. The drug is in my veins now. Your life is your own for the taking. My body must be slowing down now. But my heart is at the speed of flying. I’m walking out, I close the door. I’m down the steps for the last time. You can lose too much to ever want to start. Over again - over again. When I look back and think about it. All I see is her face staring into mine. I feel the child holding onto me. I’m smelling his sweet smell of innocence. The world has become too silent. This night it seems everlasting. The clocks ticking on like dripping water. But the hands are not moving. I’m walking out, I close the door. I’m down the steps for the last time. Then dawn breaks open in faded blue. And the sounds of the city waking. I’m walking out, I close the door. I’m down the steps for the last time. But the grass is soaked with fallen dew. And the sun is almost rising"
deadeye,"To the thoughts of the many from the minds of the few. Voice of reason, censored view. The truth is the News and the News is the truth. As if that'll do as a lame excuse for. Killing the slavers, taking the slaves. Burying the dead, then robbing the graves. Stealing the modesty from heroes brave. Making the tears gush like waves. Ch: Deadeye watches, still the killing carries on. To the rhythm of the gunfire and the voices of concern. Deadeye claims to be some conscience for us all. But I was never born to be some fly upon the wall. Window dressing and the tinsel wreath. Stealing the pity and the widow's grief. Sentimental with a furrowed brow. Pinning the heart on the blooded sleeve. Ch: Deadeye watches, still the killing carries on . .. And yes I've crouched beneath the glow - dazzled by it all. But this is not the world I know or people I recall.. To the thoughts of the many from the minds of the few:. Voice of reason, censored view. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Here is the butterfly, here's the wing."
devil's bargain,"So you found your way out there to the edge of the world. Where the falcons fly but you're still pinned to the ground. So up the stony pathways like moses before. To stand high on your mountain and look down on us all. They call this faith, they call it a devils bargain. Or just following on to the end. There's a thousand little tricks and games of control. And the withholding of love is the cruelest of all. People are like trees, they sway and they bend. But you stand like a rock and face into the wind. They call this faith. And the closer to the sun. the colder and thinner the air becomes. But you were never scared of anything or anyone. You stand like a statue as the animals come. To take from your hand, to eat from your hand. There's a dusty old photograph I'll always recall. Maybe it's true what they say - it takes a piece of your soul. You were jumping from the bridge and falling into space. Looking back at the camera with that smile on your face. They call this faith"
did you make it safe,"The chase was hard (to the water). The chase was long (to the sunlight). Through the searing heat of the midday sun. I'm out of breath, I am gasping out. I'm almost gone, I am almost gone. My heart it is beating, my heart it is pounding. Looking back, there's something there. Against the rocks, burning clear. I see his shape with the horns and spear. It's a very long way, far, far away. From your hometown streets and all those rusting mills. And they never could understand. Why you had to go, why you had to go. So did you make it safe to the promised place?. And did they take you in like you were part of them?. You wanted it so much - all those days of dreaming. You gave it all your faith, you gave it all your faith. And I remember the night we passed each other. You were like the last on earth, still praying, still praying. My heart it was pounding, my heart it was beating. With him standing there with the horns and spear. It's a very long way, far, far away. From your hometown streets and all those rusting mills. And they never could understand. Why you had to go, why you had to go"
drag it down,"They started work this morning down at city square. They're pulling down the statues of our great grandfather's hero. The new books said he wasn't such a great man after all. And anyway remember that the times they are a-changing. Chorus:. Pull it down, drag it down. Till there's nothing to look up to. But the brand names on the posters all around. They proved on television last night that God was just a lie. He never made the world at all. It was just some sweet old fashioned rite. So melt down all the ornaments, move out all the graves. And let us build the disco that we need for our young braves. Chorus:. Pull it down, drag it down. Till the hopes and dreams of all the ages. Past are shattered on the ground. We think we are so clever killing heroes, killing magic,. Until everything that's sacred is brought down to our level. for Mammon is a jealous master, - leaves no room for any other. All the questions left unanswered, all the answers gone forever. So bow to the woman in the finest fur. Bow to the man with the ace street cool. Bow to the woman with all the power. Bow to the man with all the money. In whose sight are we equal now?. Now, that we killed God?"
drummy b,"The bonfires blazed across the city, the smoke swirling into the sky. We were standing shoulder to shoulder, Billy McCann and I. Our faces ruddy and burning as we stared into the flames. But I know now the things that we saw that night were not the same. Ch: And I see you as I walk away, standing by your barricade. It's all over now between us - Billy McCann goodbye. So we'll sit up at the bar for the last time the way we used to do. And I'll toast the love that you showed me and the faith I gave to you. And we can drive out and watch the sunrise from the top of the Glenshane Pass. And I won't make you answer the questions I've always tried to ask. Ch: And I see you as I walk away standing by your barricade."
eleven years,"Stevie said now don't look round they're watching us. Two girls in the corner of that dodgy club. And the grey eyes, the storm that I've come to know and wish for. Before I caught a breath, well, she was standing there.. We walked the streets of our town just talking. And the dawn broke grey and freezing through the deserted blocks. Just when your life is stale and there's reason there for everything. Something comes to kick you up inside. Eleven sweet years and no nearer home. A hundred thousands miles through this battle zone. Still high on the wire above the hollow darkness. Trying not to look down. No Rest for the wicked is still how it goes. Twisted up and turning in my bed alone. And separation pains like a blunted amputation. Pushing endless coins in the telephone. Eleven sweet years and no nearer home. A hundred thousands miles through this battle zone. Still high on the wire above the hollow darkness. Trying not to look down. So rest in these open arms and lie until they come for you. And tell me everything you've ever felt, tell me everything you want to see . .. Forever running even when we are standing still. Driven on and fired up as the whirlwinds blow. And shouting out inside ""I'm proud of you, I'm proud of you"". Ten thousand footsteps echo down the Brixton Road. Eleven sweet years and no nearer home. A hundred thousands miles through this battle zone. Still high on the wire above the hollow darkness."
f#ny,"Took a drink from the bottle in my coat. I can smell it now like it was yesterday. The cold November winds biting round those Bradford streets. Going downtown to the club where your band used to play. Well the years go by, and the choices come. We fall by the wayside one by one. Ch: And there's nobody left but you now. There's nobody left but you. Stevie he was always just the quiet one. Got married, got buried the way that people do. Came back ten years later, tried to make up he was still young. With all the drugs and the girls and the stuff he thought he should have had. But you, your monsters became your friends. And you'll carry them with you till the bitter end. Ch: And there's nobody left but you now . .. Only you, only you. Somehow you survived, well I don't know how. And you still burn the same, maybe a little slower now. You remember the winter of '79 and going down in the rain to the Royal Standard to watch the Ruts play?"
family,"Joey puts her make-up on really well. She looks cool in the flashing lights. And all the boys gossip about the shape of her legs. On these muddled up and drunken nights. And if it's all got to end up between the sheets. She can coo like a virgin dove. But really she just doesn't want to be alone. And if you want you can call that love. M6 southbound roadside cafe on a wild wet and windy night. There's a kid in a sleeping bag huddled in a corner, trying to beg a light. He's got mum and dad tattooed on his arm. From when he thought that that would make it alright. He's got hope and fear on his young boy's face. Another innocent taking flight, saying. Chorus:. Give me some place that I can go. Where I don't have to justify myself. Swimming out alone against this tide. Looking for family looking for tribe. They said go, get out, we've got our own lives to lead. Now that water is thicker than blood. And every house is divided into single flats. With their very own little welcome rug. The shopping mall it is teeming with life. Fighting for the goodies on the shelf. But there's those funny old people on the escalators. Talking to themselves, saying. Chorus:. Give me some place that I can go. Where I don't have to justify myself. Swimming out alone against this tide. Looking for family looking for tribe. Well I survive on my own for a while or so. Upon a whim or a bottle of wine. Just trying to make sense of these new surroundings. I only changed my name a couple of times. Please take me back Joey, I'm really sorry. Can we try to make a happy home?. But she's gone with someone else and they're starting a family. Trying for a clan of their own, so. Chorus:. Give me some place that I can go. Where I don't have to justify myself. Swimming out alone against this tide."
family life,"How did they do this to you?. How did they do this to you?. Were you the weapon that they used. As they tore apart the family. Did they bring you here as they were passing through?. How did they do this to you?. And now you don't want to go home. And now you say that you never will go home. Take a tram across the city. Past the places where your brother died. Of the comfort for the girls who work alone. And I can't tell you that you're not alone. In the cities of the far north, the skies are cold and clear. The loneliness is aching. And after all this time and after all these words. Your hands are still shaking. Why did they do this to you?. Why did they do this to you?. Were they cut off from their past?. Did they try to kill the future?. Do we all forget the things that we once knew?. Why did they do this to you?. Who was it that did this to you?. Who was it that did this to you?. Well if I could have my way. I would line them up against a wall. Do unto them as they have done to you. Who was it that did this?."
far better thing,"In the white washed cancer ward with my hot blood running wild. I see the pain behind your eyes and the search for a reason. And the knowing and the fear of the passing season. Now please give me strength to cut and to keep our secret. Please give me strange to cut. Ch: That the things we love may remain here still. There is time to wait and there's a time to kill. I see your outstretched hand through the closing door. But it's a far better thing I do than I have done before. And so it seems that murder's not so hard - I've eaten flesh and blood each day. And if I believe the things I write through the passing season. Then with a rifle in my hand and with a thousand reasons. I'll wait, far above the crowd in the summer sunshine. And history changes now, forever. That the things we love may remain here still. There is time to wait and there's a time to kill. From the barren land come the seeds of war."
fate,"I put my hands into the roaring flames. I felt the pain as it started to burn. I've done the same thing over again and again. As if I never ever wanted to learn. Moving through the world at obsession speed. Leave a dust trail crossing the land. I'm crying out in fury to the gods of fate. Come on, get me if you can. I'm a master at the art of how to kill. I've killed the things that I love the best. There's blood on the walls of my home. Patterned with the coward's kiss. And love it is the key that unlocks the door. But you never know what's waiting behind. Crying out in fury to the gods of fate. Come and get me if you can. I'm screaming in the wind, screaming in the rain. Screaming in the face of the storm. Howling in out in the roaring surf. With the waves crashing down into foam. To feel something without a weakness. As She batters me down into the sand. Crying out in fury to the gods of fate. Come on and get me if you can. Now I understand what they told me years ago. How the stakes get higher and higher the further that you go. It's a bad time to look for forgiveness. It's a bad time for searching for home. The Wall came down in a thousand pieces. Now everybody's building their own. Disillusioned little children of the Western World. Time hangs heavy in our hands. We cry out in our fury to the gods of fate. Come on and get us if you can. We're crying out in our pride to the gods of fate. Come on and get us if you can. I'm crying out to the gods who couldn't care less."
flying through the smoke,"Red dots - close my eyes - tunnel vision. the cooling towers like Cathedrals. Pitch black dark, brighter than the sun. Less than zero, more than infinity. Forever the graphics curling on the screen. Forever the numbers counting on and on. Flying through the smoke, flying through the smoke. See the body of people move across the floor. Dancing turning wheeling in the spinning lights. I remember the music and the noise so loud. All I could see was you moving your mouth. Tell me what was it you were trying to say. Tell me what was it you were trying to say. And all the time everything was moving away. like a slo-mo shot as the camera pulls across the crowd. across the faces caught in the last few seconds of life. And you - like a ghost at the feast. your eyes so small and dark and dead - you were uninvited. And me - trying to remember how nobody saw you. sitting next to me on the bus as it turned into Mainstreet. and the bomb in the bag at your feet. What was it you were trying to say. Tell me what was it you were trying to say. Flying through the smoke in a deafening roar. Screaming in the panic as the whirlwind hits. Tell me what was it you were trying to say."
freedom,"It's time to rebuilding Dresden, the great machines come a-rumbling in. The desecration of the ruins and everything that might have been. You showed me the square in the melting snow. As the light was beginning to fade. But your melancholy eyes betrayed you. Just as you have been betrayed. I get culture shock coming back to the west - I can feel the wicked sting. I see the stores all glittering like idiot's gold beckoning the innocents in. The constructed face of a civilised world, complete cosmetic control. But it's not far back to the caves and the trees. And soon it will be time to go. Freedom? I don't hear any more songs of freedom.. 121st street and rising the western dream aspires. The crack kings like to drive German cars and there's children up for sale. The streets are left scorched and barren. There's twenty-seven channels on the cable television. Get gang murder hype from Tinseltown to sell a movie about Malcolm X. But freedom? I don't hear any more songs of freedom.. So pinned down and what do we get?. A longer piece of rope for our cute little necks. Sweet liberty and her faithlessness."
frightened,"It's all out on the streets today but you, you've found a place to hide. Too busy with the ratrace, you pass by on the other side. Yours is the face of the brand new Britain with blinkers on your eyes. Find yourself position and cling on for dear life. You're so frightened, everybody's so frightened. The papers tell of rape and murder, everything that you want to hear. Bad tidings on the radio - you find a way to name your fear. So you never pick up hitchhikers, never talk to strangers. Believe the world outside your bolted door is evil. You're so frightened, everybody's so frightened.. You are just a victim of your own bad dreams. While people are the same as we've always been. But through the blindness in your eyes. For just one minute I see them shine. Love me . won't you love me? But they all turn away. You never fight for anything, you always turn your face away. And you never get involved in trouble let all evil have it's way. So as the girl screams in the street below, you turn up the television. Perhaps you'll see it on the news - well it's nothing to do with you. You're too frightened, everybody's so frightened."
get me out,"Get up early every morning. Just to put your make up on. The wardrobe's full of useless clothes. Your winter coats are gone. The jackal pack is feeding. The motorway sweeps down. The council tries to bribe the rich. Just to stay in town. Ch:. Get me out. Get me out of this place. Get me out of this trap. Get me out of my brain. Ysidro down to Melbourne. The pressure starts to build. The bullets fly at random. When you least expect they will. Everybody feels guilty. So anyone can pay. I'm just surprised it doesn't happen every bloody day. Ch. So here come the nineties. The temperature is rising. I cannot seem to loose the stains. When I wash my hands. One world is rising,. One world is dying. And one has got it's precious head. Buried in the sand. Ch."
ghost of your father,"It took fourteen hours to hitch from London to Portsmouth. I can picture you in your battered old coat. Blown by the trucks on the side of the road. Cursing the world just until one pulls over. The cab is warm, the driver is talking. And oh if he had his time over again. And you laugh with the man, but you think of another. Stealing away around each darkened corner. The ghost of your father always, always watching. And he waits for you when the black tide comes. And you feel the ghost of your father waiting. An unbearable stillness hangs over these days. Humming with the promises broken. The bewildered watch from behind misted-up glass. As the ambitious and lucky get to feed on the carcass. When you feel so much in such a small space. Do you think you can keep on running. Like the papers that blow down your empty street. Outside in the dark when you cannot sleep. The ghost of your father always, always watching. And he waits for you when the black tide comes."
ghost train,"It's a long warm September and we're both still alive. And the sea is like a painting beneath the mirrored sky. Raise the dead, raise the dead. We'll go riding on the ghost train, together raise the dead. Through the summer scented shadows, we were frozen in the light. And She brushed upon our faces, disappeared into the night. Raise the dead, raise the dead. We'll go riding on the ghost train, together raise the dead. Time becomes liquid and death becomes a friend. We'll live the life together with the wheel still in spin. Raise the dead, raise the dead."
ghosts,"So did you lose your faith?. Did you fall upon your sword?. I know she took a piece of your heart. And I know I had a piece of your soul. And now you follow me into the room. Filled with echoes and mirrors. And the sound of something pounding. As you hang there just watching. And when the music is gone the silence is still ringing. With all these conversations. between the dead and the living. For the ghosts become part of us. the ghosts are part of us. Well, you always say you were following your heart. As it took you through these rainy streets. and on into the dark. But there is some kind of reckoning. when everything is done. For it seems the more that you give. the stronger you become. And there is so much more left for the giving. In all these conversations between the dead and the living. For the ghosts become part of us, the ghosts are part of us"
gigabyte wars,"Well, you never grow up, you just get older, carrying. all the familiar burdens with you, walking back on. the hometown streets on a night devoid of stars.. No one ever said it was going to be just, you really. ought to know by now how She's all red in tooth and claw;. after all, weren't you the one screaming for more?. In the gigabyte wars - round and round we go,. beneath the vapour trails - tangled up inside in a web of lies,. hostages of fortune and savage tales.. Well, you entered stage in blood and pain, gulped for air. and then you cried out - this is just the way it comes;. that's Stupid Questions again . .. It's not the things that you fear that come to get you,. But all the things you don't expect, face down in a. drowning pool of unfulfilled desire, in the gigabyte wars . .. Then comes the rain - just seems to make the night grow hotter,. we listen to the drops as they clatter on the roofs of the cars;. sometimes it seems like you're going to suffocate in this. conspiracy of noise - but though the ties they stretch to break-point,. still they hold, still they hold, and blood runs still in crimson streams. and dries like the earth - but still they hold.. In the gigabyte wars, once we were lost, then we were found;. once we were found - then we were lost again.. Get real, if a real exists - there's nothing more than this,."
grandmother's footsteps,"Come with me my little innocents, there's a game that we can play. See how much we can change your world while you look the other way. Turn around as if to see if you can catch us cheat. And all you'll find are shining presents laid down at your feet. Take the bait, take the bait. Television is flash and Coke is nice and you can have the rest. Dream those dreams you've always had of wealth and power and sex. We'll run your mines, your factories and we'll take our little toll. And you can have these missiles too while we maintain control. Chorus:. Creeping, creeping footsteps around the world. While they promise us everything we've ever wanted. Hush now, don't you cry, don't you realise your crime?. Like lambs go to the slaughterhouse, we know our rights from wrongs. But we go down to the shopping mall with 30 silver coins. And somewhere out in South America, where the forests lie in ruin. They shout - we'd better get these natives some clothes. Because their videos are coming in soon. Chorus:. Creeping, creeping footsteps around the world."
great expectations,"When I was young I dreamed and dreamed. About all the things that I was going to be. A brave explorer holding court or a really famous astronaut. A handsome pop star on the screen or captain of the England team. They said ""Son, it could all be yours, you just work hard and pay your dues. Don't be content with what you've got, there's always more that you can want. Everybody's on the make - that's what made this country great"". Chorus:. So all I wanted in the end. Was world domination and a whole lot of money to spend. A little place to call my home, like a planet that was all my own. Well that's not much to ask, it's really not. It's not much to ask, just the same as anybody else. So welcome to the free for all, the smash and grab, the freeloaders ball. Where everything is here for us if we scream, shout, make a fuss. There's nothing that we can't afford with a poisoned tongue and a sharpened sword. Spoilt children in a row - no one dares to tell them ""no"". Chorus:. So all I wanted in the end. Was world domination and a whole lot of money to spend. Everything I touch, everything I see, fame and fortune, immortality. Well that's not much to ask, it's really not. It's not much to ask, just the same as anybody else. So in every heart there's a broken dream, a shattered cause, a might have been. In every eye there's a secret tear, in every heart there's a secret fear. That this is it, done, complete. Resign yourself to your defeat."
green and grey,"The time I think most clearly, the time I drift away. Is on the bus-ride that meanders up these valleys of green and grey. I get to think about what might have been and what may yet come true. And I get to pass a rainy mile thinking of you. And all the while, all the while, I still hear that call. To the land of gold and poison that beckons to us all. Nothing changes here very much, I guess you'd say it never will. The pubs are all full on Friday nights and things get started still. We spent hours last week with Billy boy, bleeding, yeah queuing in Casualty. Staring at those posters we used to laugh at:. Never Never Land, palm trees by the sea. Well there was no need for those guys to hurt him so bad. When all they had to do was knock him down. But no one asks to many questions like that since you left this town. Chorus:. And tomorrow brings another train. Another young brave steals away. But you're the one I remember. From these valleys of green and the grey. You used to talk about winners and losers all the time - as if that was all there was. As if we were not of the same blood family, as if we live by different laws. Do you owe so much less to these rain swept hills than you owe to your good self?. Is it true that the world has always got to be something. That seems to happen somewhere else?. For God's sake don't you realise that I still hear that call. Do you think you're so brave just to go running to that which beckons to us all?. Chorus:. No, not for one second did you look behind you. As you were walking away. Never once did you wish any of us well. Those who had chosen to stay. And if that's what it takes to make it. In the place that you live today. Then I guess you'll never read these letters that I send."
guessing,"Some people know just what they want. They stare straight into the sun. And some they stand in no mans land. Waving at the devil that they know. and the devil that they don't. As the gods smile down into the bowl of passions. I can feel when the thunder's coming. But fate comes quicker than a bullet to the back of the head. Halfway across the bridge is when I realise what I've done. But I cannot chase the sunset any quicker than I'm going. And I'm going like I never begun. And I thought that I believed. in all the things that you sanctify. Bitter is the taste of freedom -more empty than the sky. And the taste of freedom is the thing that you won't deny. Through the hours of shell-hole desperation. Waiting, waiting - out here in no mans land. Waving at the devil that I know and the devil that I don't. More empty than the sky"
happy to be here,"I'm peering through the wiper blades. the headlights blurred in driving rain. On the inky dusk of midnight blue. the black ships blow across the sky. The south-coast towns awash. with ghosts and sailors tales and icy spray. And men gone off to foreign wars. to stand beneath the tattered flags. Cast a wish and wish for far away. The statue stands in weathered. stone gazing into the winter storms. Waiting for the unreturned. And I go this way alone and I'm happy to be here. The back roads run with gushing streams. fallen branches, blown leaves. I stood there in the graveyard lost. beneath the dripping trees. The past it is a barren place of men. condemned by their own hand. And all those faded possibilities. The shipwrecks lie in silence as the fish. swim through sunken rooms. At the bottom of the sea, at the bottom of the sea. And I go this way alone and I'm happy to be here. Out beyond the neon mist and on into the deluge. Oblivion and darkness rushing in. For everything I've ever touched turned out. to be so fragile. Crushed like shells beneath the shingle. and the shifting sands. All of the strength that I have is bound in. with the raging storms. Blowing out to sea. And I go this way alone and I'm happy to be here"
headlights,"Lit up like a Christmas tree, the oil refinery glows in the night;. and down by the shoreline the seagulls fly white, against the black.. The great moon riding shotgun - rolling out across the veil of clouds,. and you were small, and lying awake listening to the noises in the house.. With the best of them you ran, like all of us, in our season. Casting memory aside - your history, all forgotten;. driven onwards through the years in love with each distraction.. But all the while, the past is close behind;. like headlights on your tail, headlights on your tail.. Your pulse is beating faster now, like a bird flying hard against the wind;. trying to understand all the crazed compulsions that you feel.. And all the little jealousies and betrayals, they echo in the dark;. and somewhere back through it all, the key is still turning in the lock.. Now the ghosts that you have laid, they all come out to greet you;. the knowledge that you've gained - well, none of this protects you.. You've been so very far, still peace will not embrace you,. for all the while the past is close behind.."
here comes the war,"Today, as you listen to this song. Another 394,000 children were born into this world. They break like waves of hunger and desire upon these eroded shores. Carrying the curses of history and a history yet unwritten. The oil burns in thick black columns, the buzz saws echo through the forest floor. They shout give us our fair share, give us justice. Here comes the war. On a grey morning to the south of here. Two young men in makeshift uniforms peer into the misty light. And figures dart behind the trees. As a snap of rifle rounds echoes out across the fields. They hardly know their sacred mother tongue but they know their duty. To defend the flag hanging limp and bloody above the village church. While a thousand miles away, in a warehouse complex down by the river,. Young money men play paintball games. Here comes the war - put out the lights on the Age of Reason. So blow out the candle and tell us another of those great stories,. the ones about serial killers. Let dreams flow into savage times.. Do you hear the sirens scream across the city?. We've had three hot nights in succession - the riot season is here again. Dear Lord, lead us back into the Valley of the Shadow of Death,. Here comes the war. Did you think we were born in peaceful times?. Faster, faster, like a whirling dervish spinning round. Faster, faster, until the Centre cannot Hold. You screamed give us Liberty or give us Death. Now you've got both, what do you want next ?."
heroes,"We are not children any more. The fists you made they are come bashing at your door. Your legacy is waiting in the wings. And there's something so familiar in the hunger that we bring. We don't want to be like you, don't want to live like you. Learn by our own mistakes, thank you. Forcing time and pushing through. Chorus:. You are not our heroes anymore. Dim the lights the time is come. Into the ring the father and the son. Sown in sweat and passion long ago. And now the blood on our hands is the same as our own. And the man has the skill and the man has the power. But the boy has the will to win and so much time. Chorus:. You are not our heroes anymore. If you knew then what you know now to be true. You never would have started this whole chain we're going through. And you love us now but you hate us still. And we hate you now but we love you still. Chorus:. You are not our heroes anymore. You are not my mother, you are not my father."
heroin,"He said - come on now little darling, if you love me like you say. You can just lie there and sniff the smoke, you don't have to use your vein. And you knew all the stories, but this sweet boy would never do you harm. You remember very clearly the blood with which you signed. Because the night gave you virginity was the night it took your mind. They said that you were pretty then,. In the mirror now you see this worn and greasy slut. Ch: We only get one crack at this, we only get the once. Just four score years and ten, old friend,. And yours are bleeding away with the puss that fills your veins. So now here come your customers knocking on your door. With the faces of stupid children who think they are something more. You believed the lies that brought you here. So now you pass the same lies like disease. And where are all your family to lock that waiting door?. And where are all your good friends to slap your stupid face. Instead you've got your little club who'll protect you, sure . .. Like they'll slit your throat for a couple of quid. Ch: We only get one crack at this . .. No matter how you kid yourself, well, you still know the truth. Just one sweet life that's it, old friend,. And yours is bleeding away with the puss that fills your veins. And your little son just two years old, comes crawling across the floor. Past the red eviction notice that lies unopened by the door. But they all live so far away and here . . it's all OK . .."
high,"Down beneath the swoosh of the turbines, the long grass blows in ripples. There’s a beautiful spiral of roads that leads the lost up here. I was watching the birds taking off to swoop down over the city. They find and take just what they need and turn, turn, turn. The movers move, the shakers shake, the winners write their history. But from high on the high hills it all looks like nothing. The movers move, the shakers shake, the winners write their history. But from high on the high hills it all looks like nothing. That afternoon on Hustlergate with all the TVs flickering. While behind the sky was moving liquid crimson gold. Brothers, sisters, pay no heed to the unfaithful messengers. For theirs is a prison world of lies, lies, lies. Where the movers move, the shakers shake, the winners rewrite history. But from high on the high hills it all looks like nothing. The movers move, the shakers shake, the winners write their history. But from high on the high hills it all looks like nothing. The keening wind it blows through me, it blows through me. My time it must be almost done, be almost done. All these things you fear so much depend on angles of vision. From down in the maze of walls you can’t see what’s coming. But from high on the high hills it all looks like nothing. But from high on the high hills it all looks like nothing, nothing"
higher wall,"We're out here on the borders with our favourite few possessions. Traded stories whispered round the fire. As shadows in the searchlights, mugshots in the files. Waiting in the camps behind the wire. Kick the door until it opens, what you have you cannot hold. We are young, forever hungry, you are fat and growing old. Still every day you try to build a higher wall. We pick the leaves of coca, we stack the crates of cola. We wait upon the tables where you dine. And learn from you not to accept the little that we're given. To take the piece of silver where we can. Now clutching at these papers in another office line. We're staring from the darkness up at windows filled with light. And every day you try to build a higher wall. In my town we used to pray to idols sent from far away. From out beyond the dusty days, we heard your voices call. And in your town the streets are cleaned. The order stands, the sirens scream. You talk of peace, vacation dreams - and reinforce the wall. Now in the queues at immigration, in the border zone. We are your bastard children, all coming home. And every day you try to build a higher wall. Every day you try to build a higher wall. But your money cannot stop us. And you violence cannot stop us."
history,"I know that it happened, I know that story. But that was years and years ago. Still you're pushing and still you're claiming. The pound of flesh you say I owe. Ch: We've already paid for it. We've already strung for it. We've already died for it. Why can't you leave us alone?. There is no whitewash, there's no conspiracy. You're not a victim anymore. I know it's easy to be a loser. If you spill acid in your sores. Ch: We've already paid for it . .. Bring in the hard men, bring in the armoury. If escalation's what you want. Everybody needs an enemy. But I don't want to be yours."
horsemen,"It is written and so shall be. That all things will come to an end. For if we have to go then it's all coming with us. Come hell and high water. It must be, it must be. That on the far horizon. They're saddling up the horsemen. By candlelight, by oil-light. By the light of computer screens. Hunched over tables and endless calculations. Then inscribed in beauty upon paper, upon vellum. Engraved upon the stones. It must be, it must be. That on the far horizon. They're saddling up the horsemen"
i love the world,"The roll of distant thunder breaks, the afternoon of silence wakes. They hurry through from Petergate as if they know this dance. In fury blind, I drive at night across the moors, the open roads. Beneath the freezing starry skies, racing in some trance. These cities are illusions of some triumph over Nature's laws. We've seen the iron carcass rust and buildings topple into dust. And as the waters rise, it seems we cling to all the rootless things. The Christian lies, technology, while spirits scream and sing. Oh God I love the world. Well I never said I was a clever man but I know enough to understand. That the endless leaps and forward plans will someday have to cease. You blind yourselves with comfort lies like lightning never strikes you twice. And we laugh at your amazed surprise as the Ark begins to sink. This temple that is built so well to separate us from ourselves. Is a power grown beyond control, a will without a face. And watching from outside I wish that I could wash my hands of this. But we are locked together here, this bittersweet embrace. Oh God I love the world. And if one day the final fire explodes across the whitened sky. I know you've said you'd rather die and make it over fast. With courage from your bravest friends, waiting outside for the end. With no bitterness but an innocence that I can't seem to grasp. I know somehow I will survive - this fury just to stay alive. So drunk with sickness, weak with pain, I can walk the hills one last time. Scarred and smiling, dying slow, I'll scream to no one left at all. I told you so, I told you so, I told you so . .."
i need more time,"Woke up this morning and my mouth was dry. The clouds were rushing downstream through the sky. I get a blind kind of panic that locks me inside. My mind numb and my heart racing. I am a man with too many reasons. On the road with too many signs. I play a deck with too many cards. Too many games of too many kinds. The seasons turned so fast and I'm moving too slow. I get blown off course, like everyone. I know I need more time, I need more time. To make good on the promises. I made to the world when the world was moving slower. Tick tock tick tock. As one by one the faces we love slide away into deep, deep waters. I've still so much to give, I've still so much to learn. I've still so much to love, still so much to burn. I need more time, I need more. To make good on the promises. I made to the world when the world was moving slower"
i wish,"Today seems so special like a beginning or an end. And there's so many thousand people here. After all the grey days we're shining once again. And I wouldn't be anywhere else in the world. We never want to fight you, we only want to love. Ch: I wish it could always be like this. I wish I could always be in love. The world reflects the passion in your grey eyes. And I see them shine. You raise up your arms like you believe that you can fly. And I want you so much now. I never want to hurt you - I only want to love. Ch: I wish it could always be like this."
if you can't save me,"In a nowhere bar-room on the east side of the city. There was a strange smell of burning outside in the street. I was giving a sermon like the son of a preacher. I was high on revolution and wild with belief. Across the table she was lighting a cigarette. And in the light of the flame her eyes flashed fury as she turned to me. She said - you're never going to save the world. you're never going to save the world. you're never going to save the world. If you can't save me. On Cavalry Hill, the sky turned black. And the wind blew the dust in the blistering heat. But the heavens were empty, no angels came. The only sound I remember was the crying of Mary and the mother's weep. And he cried out - you're never going to save the world. you're never going to save the world. you're never going to save the world. If you can't save me. It's all vanity and you're never going to save the world. you're never going to save the world. you're never going to save the world. If you can't save me. -- By Adnan Paniagua"
inheritance,"Mother, Father, I'm doing OK. On the other side of the country, far away. And though I know the things that you want to hear me say. Sometimes these things are hard. Mother, Father, I am your son. Right down to the long thin pointed face. And this muddled up and twisted tongue. And now I find that I'm doing. All those things you would have done. Sometimes these things are hard. Chorus:. So do I thank you? Do I curse you?. These tracks stretch out before me - the ones you left behind. What I want and what I feel - it's yours, yours, not mine. Mother, Father, all those battles that have been. And the long, long silences that lay in between. Please don't try to tell me all those were in vain. Sometimes these things are hard. We line up at the wedding in rows of deep set eyes. In our finest formal dresses and proper suits and ties. Like a family of Munsters in a really bad disguise. Chorus:. So do I thank you? Do I curse you?. These tracks stretch out before me - the ones you left behind."
innocence,"Chorus:. We scream, you run - fall out. You scream and we're gone - falling out. There must have been times in the smoke and the beat on the dance-floor. When all of the doors, they were opening for you. There must have been times when you thought you were kings of the whole world. With the chemicals eating away at your reason. But now you're shut down, closed in. We build our own little jails. I've had to watch this thing so many times. Another little death of innocence. Chorus:. Now, we scream, you run - fall out. You scream and we're gone - falling out. None of us saw the clever image you hold of yourselves. The things that you thought were so cool were just a joke to everyone else. Didn't they tell you when you pulled a stupid expression. That when the wind changed you'd be stuck with it forever?. And now you're shut down, closed in, with all the money you owe. I've had to watch this thing so many times. Another little death of innocence. Chorus:. We scream, you run - fall out."
into the wind,"We went to see the fall of Rome – I thought it would please us. To watch how the mighty go in a blaze of hubris. But I just stood there hypnotised by all the beautiful madness. Face into the wind, boys, face into the wind. Last night I dreamed that we built a fire in a wild garden. We took all the holy books and we burned them. All those pages to ashes, every last one of them. Face into the wind, boys, face into the wind. Everything under the sun shall be harnessed. Forced to push and pull and endure like unwilling horses. All for the ceaseless construction of Man’s Great Purpose. Face into the wind, boys, face into the wind. And in the Market Square they’re still stacking the shelves. I’m screaming: I don’t want anything, I don’t need anything. I don’t want anything, I don’t need anything"
killing,"It was summer when they finally came, the law of force. and line upon line of machine upon machine, back into the greenwood,. closer to the heart of things we go - beneath the wires stretched against the sky,. spitting out in desperation - stop the killing . .. The wind blows down from St George's Hill through to Stanworth Woods,. and to the East, on this grey and pallid dawn the lights from the rigs. blinking out across the poisoned sea, a little group of ships floating out to meet the coming storm. sailing on in desperation - stop the killing . .. Raised and bound upon the land, and the everlasting whispers in diamond. through the trees, in the breath of Eden . .. Innocent still the faith we hold - our time will come . .. That which walks the corridors of power is a virus that mutates;. immune to all resistance, and every turn of history . .. And all that's left for us is marking crosses upon doors,. and scrawling in the golden sand before each tide comes rolling in;. screaming out in desperation - stop the killing . .."
knievel,"I was driving from the day. I was born. I can picture it now and how. I feel standing on my grandfather's knee. Holding on to the steering wheel. Out onto the desert roads. And all the years of in between. I was always going too fast. One part blood and one of gasoline. Do they come to see a man fall - or to see him fly?. The neon chrome in the dazzling sun. The money I've lost and the money I've won. All of it here, then all of it gone. If I tell you that the world is hard. All bleached out bone crushed to sand. I'll tell you that I kept my word. And more than that I never gave a damn. There are those that come with an easy smile. Maybe that is what they're for. I was gone twenty-nine days. You only get from me what you pay me for. Do they come to see a man fall - or to see him fly?. Do they come to see a man fall - or to see him fly?. So did you come to see a man fall - or to see him fly?. The river is deep, the valley is wide. There's something waiting on the other side. Crash the gates of heaven wide. I'll take it now - and have a crack at the angels"
lean back and fall,"Then one night we ventured on too far. The old sun it""s never rose. I searched through the dawn into a new world beyond. Where all that I could want. Was to lean back and fall. We chased each other through those frozen days. Through the coldest winter in fifteen years. We were rising to break. Like the sea against the shore. Like the land around the sea. As we lean back and fall. I'm falling again. Now counting through these useless empty days. Of standing up so down against the world. I'm lost, I'm lost and I can't trust myself. Now I can't trust myself. I'm lost in and I'm down in myself. I'm losing myself as I lean back and fall. Then one night we ventured on too far. The old sun never rose. I searched through the dawn. Into a new world beyond. Where all that I could want. Was to lean back and fall"
leeds road 3am,"The Festival is over and the strings of coloured lights. are blowing crazy in the coming wind. One bulb comes loose, shatters on the ground. The empty streets pick up the sound, it echoes like a tiny gunshot. ringing through the damp and through the silence. Water trickles slowly like the feel of troubles only half washed away. Behind the wire the watchman doing nights sits beside a wall of screens. but he's not watching - gazing into the steam rising from his cup of coffee. He's locked away inside. Staring into the light of a different world.. Near the top of Sandford Road, there's a parked Mondeo in the shadows. The lighting of a cigarette illuminates four faces not talking, just waiting. The man in the front passenger seat holds the phone to his ear. listens to a thin voice giving the details. While in the back the boy with the long hair. stares out through the misty glass into the dark streets. and into the light of a different world. Three streets down the restaurant is empty, 3am weeknights, dead-time. The owner came here years ago and never lost the dream of going home. but knows he never will. In the kitchen his son sits head in hands thinks about leaving. Anywhere - just somewhere that's not here. Doesn't look up or see the Mondeo passing outside. He's staring into the light a different world. There's a couple in a red car coming home late on the inner ring. not talking or listening to the music just lost in their own thoughts. The Mondeo shoots the lights at sixty-five. Swerves, catches the red car that spins and rolls. Lands upside down in a crumple of metal and shattered glass. The girl sits trapped inside watching new blood trickle down her shoulder. Turns to see her boyfriend slumped against the dash. as a little crowd gathers round. 'Make him wake up, make him wake up' she's screaming. 'Make him wake up, make him wake up' and now she's pushing at him. 'Make him wake up, make him wake up'. But he's gone. Staring into the light of a different world."
lights go out,"I went to my mother, said - please make me king. I went to my mother, said - I've got to be king. She said son - well you've got to wait your turn. Patience is a virtue that you never seemed to learn. You were born with nothing, to nothing you'll return. Chorus:. Now, now the lights go out - there's no warning. Now, now the lights go out - there's no reason. Now, now the voices cry - we don't need you now. I went to my father, said - please make me king. Went to my father, said - I've got to be king. He said son - you've got to do your time. I've done fifty-three years and I haven't yet done mine. You're just one of the millions waiting in line. Chorus:. Now, now the lights go out - there's no warning. Now, now the lights go out - there's no reason. Now, now the voices cry - we don't need you now. History gave us meaning, gave us a place. Gave my father reasons for the lines on his face. But we asked for the money and money they gave. And God, how that made us easy to enslave. So today at the office, we picked up the cheque. The handshake of gold, the stab in the back. The old men went home silent and bowed. The young men went drinking, drowning it out. So in every street, in every town, comes some young pretender. Just gunning for a crown - take it- take it all. Chorus:."
living in the rose,"The lovers they kiss and slowly they turn. for drawing a breath there is nothing but time. A thousand million years before we crash in the sun. And I know we will be still here in Her arms. In the thick black night we could lie in the grass. And gaze at the sky and watch the satellites pass. A thousand million miles, the earth She will turn. Then still we will be here in Her arms. And if we can float away in our dreams. There's a city that waits under the sea. The days to pass living in the rose. The seeded land slow and old. The scented air heavy and warm."
long goodbye,"Holed up in your little room, we talk for hour on empty hour,. pacing up and down between the walls that we have built ourselves.. No more with the long goodbye, I can't stand another tear;. I won't wait for the bell to toll - straight on for the days ahead,. straight on for the days ahead . .. You act as drowning, letting go the fingers one by one.. Come on, there's life beyond the tomb that we have built ourselves;. no more with the long goodbye . .. We don't even dare to look each other in the eyes,. or say whatever's on our minds . .. These crushing moments show the kind of people we've become,. seal betrayal with a kiss - and let it all be over, finished, done . .. It feels so good to kill the thing that stood between the truth and I. Make it fast and make it clean and let the blood run down."
lovesongs,"Under darkening thundering towering skies. We live through these painful days. Walking like strangers in streets of damnation. Under the enemy's gaze. Well we all create monsters. come back for their masters. The prices the Devil reclaims. It's funny I never thought. I'd be the one who would change. Now above and beyond the roofs of our city. The sunset spreads silent and gold. And we passing the time not thinking about you. Lost in our own little world. Well the other night we put the radio on. When we ran out of things we could say. But it always play love songs. when you're far away. Forget all the lies. forget all the trouble. Forget all the things that I've done. And please, believe like I still believe. The best is yet to come. the truth is yet to come. So damn all the world, damn their demands. And all the things that they say. 'Cause they always play love songs. when you're far away"
lullaby,"So where do we begin? It must be thirty-five years . .. You've the breath of my mother, the life of a stranger;. and there's so much to tell - so much I need to know.. All of the stories, and reasons. But your face I remember and your breath I remember. Take me in your arms, take me in your arms. So go out tonight and look up at the stars,. the light that you see is as old as I am.. And that's what I see, when I gaze in your eyes. Loving a ghost lost in confusion of time - but our love remains. through these brightest hours.. And my secret world. And your face I remember - and your breath I remember."
lurhstaap,"One swallow never made a spring. You can buy a crown - it doesn't make you king. Beware the trinkets that we bring. When the visionary dreams set hard and grey as flesh made into stone. You tore the statues to the ground crying - let my people go. And now they're gone, all is gone. But these changing winds can turn cold and hostile. The freedom passion and the two faced call. They dance together upon the wall. With nothing left to break the fall. Now twenty-five miles north in the great dark woods. The college buildings stand. And the ghosts of hope walk silent halls at the death of the Promised Land. All is gone, all is gone. But these changing winds can turn cold and hostile. And in the shadows of the crowded square, a thousand paper deals go down. And hungry sharks from everywhere smell the blood and head for town. Innocence starts to peel away - How money changes everything. The past it eats the future up and this blind desire eats everything. Now the rats they leave one stricken ship for another sailing past. Your world was going nowhere slow while ours goes nowhere fast."
lust for power,"Across the flatlands we came out of nowhere special. Like a peasant revolution - makeshift weapons in our hands. We crashed the gates so hard we'd never heard that kind of sound before. And braced ourselves for victory and the spoils of the land. Defences melt away before our frozen blank surprise. From the palace now we stare into a million waiting eyes. Chorus:. I've got my trophies on the wall, the heads I've hunted down the hall. And I guard my winnings well, carry them with me when I fall. Now the daylight hours pass like the people I have lost. In the triumph of the hour, in the bloody cause - lust, lust for power. Like a vision she dances through the shafts of light. Everything I've ever dreamed about focused true and bright. And fortune opens up the ground, blackens out the sky. I kissed her once, I kissed her twice but I couldn't remember why. When I was young they taught me well to always play to win. But they never said what happens when you've won the bloody game. Chorus:. I've got my trophies on the wall. .. And all desire is satisfied but still the hunt goes on. It's funny how this feeling stays with all the reasons gone. We've seen them fat and bloated those who once could hold a flame. I've run for home and words gone by but nothing seems the same. I can watch the world in secrecy from one side of this glass. From the other my reflection and I don't know which is worse. The streets are lined with glittering stores and a million fatted calves. I can catch myself sometimes these days and all I do is laugh, laugh. Chorus:."
march in september,"There was always something holding you back. Some other world that was calling. Maybe in the mountains where you stretched your arms. Without fear of falling. They tried to bring you their love and fear. But you would never receive it. I tried to tell you you had everything that you need. But you would never believe it. So you tried to make family. But nothing was given. So you gave them your own blood. For theirs had been stolen. Yeah, you tried to make family. But nothing was given. So you gave them your own blood. And all of it stolen. You took the water from the wishing well. You never saw that you shouldn't. You tried to break all the bad in the world. You never saw that you couldn't. You can count up everything that you have. It never stops the craving. Ain't it always the ones that want to be saved. That do all of the saving. So you tried to make family. But nothing was given. So you gave them your own blood. For theirs had been stolen. Yeah, you tried to make family. But nothing was given. So you gave them your own blood. And all it stolen"
marrakesh,"They found us in the courtyard at our table in the shade. We toasted our last few moments and then the end came. They took us back to the airstrip in that beaten up old car. And we rattled across the African scrubland in silence. Our hands locked together with cold steel cuffs. Sometimes I wish it was still that way. Now a whole world has died since then, so many faithless days. I was born alone and lucky and I'm just used to it that way. My dice still roll in sixes and yours still turn up ones. And I have taken my good fortune and I've run and run. But I always swore I'd come back for you. Is it too late now to come back for you ?. Now beneath this lonely junction on the northbound M6. We spray our words of signature on the concrete bridge. And between the words of wisdom and the slogans of despair. Someone's just gone and written 'I'm sorry' there. Well I always swore I'd come back for you. Is it too late now to come back for you?."
marry the sea,"In the tall grass upon the dune. He rests his head on you. It's warm wind and a faded sky. You watch him drifting far away. Dreaming, drowning. Did you marry a man who married the sea?. He looks right through you to the distant grey - calling, calling. Try to build a wall of sand. It flows like water through your hand. Did you marry a man who married the sea?."
master race,"Well we all learned how to use a fork and a knife. How sometimes we have to wear a suit and tie. And understand these things are what give us the right. To go around the world acting superior. We live with missiles and the armaments cache. With rewritten histories and a fictional past. And though some of us still have questions to ask. This ship, she sails without a captain. Chorus:. Goddamn the Master Race that we're born in. Goddamn the howling wolf that we're serving. I've had it up to here . .. And the opposition, we ain't doing so well. Our understanding is weak and our knowledge is small. And though kids scrawl frustration on the back street wall. Most of them can't even spell bastard. Chorus:. Goddamn the Master Race that we're born in. Goddamn the howling wolf that we're serving. Sometimes all I know is that cold wind blows. Down the valley from the mountain snows. On these muggy nights I lie awake. And wait for the thunder and the skies to break. But they are god and they are strong. And they can name the right and wrong. And they reclaim the things they own. They call us now . .. So Candy please forgive these things that I've done. When the Master Race calls I know sometimes that I run. You mean more to me now than you ever did before. As I try to stay away from their clutches. Chorus:. Goddamn the master race that we're born in."
mixam,"Cassandra's still shouting from the city walls but no one ever hears. And far below the traffic moves like fish upon the ocean floor. to the rhythms of the tide. We're holding on so tight because it seems as if we're moving very fast. But all this speed is just illusion as we while away our lives. Whatever they want from you - you don't have to give. Whatever they say to you - you don't have to give. Whatever they put you through. Fury to the left of me, madmen to the right. And on Caesars Mall seduction is so sweet. It's easy to forget that there's a price on. Whatever they want from you - you don't have to give. Whatever they say to you - you don't have to give."
modern times,"It seems strange to write about these things now. but the time has probably come when we should. accept whatever is past and gone and never will return.. Looking back to the beginning. I see a flood of painful memories. and the bitter hurt and wounded pride that comes with our defeat. We set out with our heads held high,. so sure our ground, our righteousness,. the new Jerusalem to be built with love and guts and truth. But in the end we surrendered easily.. It's no use pretending otherwise . .. well most of us had a little something to lose, enough to break our nerve.. Well, some of us made an easy peace and moved into the Brave New World;. it's hard for the true believers to look back now and realise. that for many of the crowd it was just the fashion, the cause of the moment,. well we if anyone should know that you can look pretty dumb. standing in last year's clothes.. And some of us, shell-shocked still, ran for shelter and do the rituals. the same old way pretending that someone out there cares. And some of us live in the modern world.. We give unto Caesar what is due. and harbour the bitterness of defeat and daydreams of revenge.. Now nothing you see out there is real,. It matters not what you believe in.. It matters less what you say but only what you are.."
my country,"Tell all the people who believe what they read in the press. Tell all the folk who stare from behind suburban walls. The enemy is not some nation far across the sea. The enemy is with us every single breathing day. Chorus:. So yes, I will fight for my country. The land that I love so well. Yes - for justice, a land fit for all our futures. Yes, I will fight for my country. The land that I love so well. Hear the voices of our history echo all around. Fight all the ones who divide us rich against poor. Fight all the ones who divide us white against black. Fight all the powers who want their missiles in our earth. Fight all the people who would lead us into war. No rights were ever given to us by the grace of God. No rights were ever given by some United Nations clause. No rights were ever given by some nice guy at the top. Our rights they were bought by all the blood. And all the tears of all our. Grandmothers, grandfathers before. For all the folk who gave their lives for us. For all the folk who spit out - never say die. For all the fires burning on our highest hills. For all the people spinning tales tonight. Fight all the powers who would abuse our Common Laws."
my people,"Stare across the crowd, the fear and love in their faces. The children of the tribes, prisoners of the flags unfurling. Protect us in these changing times,. The warm embrace, the killing price . .. My people right or wrong. Remember running from the hall as the voices screamed behind us. I felt I'd die for you in the sunlit hills of our home. The moments come then recede away. The empty words, the hollow light of day . .. My people right or wrong. And outside is cold, staring up at the lighted window. And in the bitter home, the thicker the blood the faster it keeps on flowing. Get in your place, boy. Let's take what's ours, boy. Understand the price, boy. I've seen those who try to make a life without kin for ever. So I've taken my place uncertain at your shoulder. The last few prayers, the whistle blow,. And into the fray once more we go."
no greater love,"There's storm clouds amassing over in the west up above the moor. The city shines in grey, mills closing down on the valley floor. All you can do here is survive, grit your teeth and just stay alive. And never understand. The young ones they dance with fire in their hearts until the years go by. And older, defeated they stare in their beer at closing time. No greater love could there ever be. Than what I feel for you, what you gave to me. You saved my life from this. While kings are in their counting houses, people just wait here in silent rows. They spat and they jeered in a last desperate fear as they watched us go. Remember how we turned and ran. Heads into the wind running hand in hand. We laughed until we cried."
no man's land,"You say that you'd rather be really poor. Than scratching, saving, scrimping all the pennies. Looking in the windows at what you can't afford. Always hungry, never starving. In no man's land the days are long. You say that you'd rather be really ill. Than just having headaches, never have no energy. All the little allergies and all the little pains. Never getting better, never getting worse. In no man's land the days are long. You say that you'd rather have no love at all. Than pathetic little words, half-hearted kisses. Never feeling anything, anything at all. Never no fire, never no passion. In no man's land the days are long. Do you believe you can come out, fighting from you shell-hole."
"no mirror, no shadow","It’s hard to talk to people who remember what I say. I guess I need an amnesiac priest or something. Or a stranger on a long bus journey to somewhere far away. One day the desert will cover all the earth. With only the wind to sing in the silence. All my secrets buried forever in the blown dust. It seems so simple but they just don’t get it. I meant what I said at the time that I said it. Nothing is ever meant to last. I want no mirror, I want no shadow. I want my follies to have no echo. Only the ties to hold on fast. Nobody has their consciences clean. Loyalty in the end will be enough. This family thicker than blood. The way we grew together, roots twisted together. And everybody thinks what they shouldn’t think. Everybody does what they shouldn’t do. Everybody wants what they shouldn’t want. Hold on to me and I’ll hold on to you. Maybe I’m wrong but they just don’t get it. I meant what I said just at the time that I said it. Nothing is ever meant to last. I want no mirror, I want no shadow. I want my follies to have no echo. Only the ties to hold on fast. We spread our mischief with a little glint in the eye. Where there is war we like to bring peace. Where there is peace we want to bring war. Seduce the priests and break it all. Just don’t ask me to remember. It seems so simple but they just don’t get it…."
no pain,"Across the town on the other hill,. your lights glow from a different world.. You always found a place to hide - nails and cross to lay beside;. with all the ghosts that we denied.. Now, in rippled arcs across the sky, the great white birds of winter fly;. and the wheel turns, and people change - scattered ashes to the wind.. And there's no pain, there's no pain, there's no pain. A dry river in the blazing sun . .. Your parched face and your callused hands,. Behind us lie the arid lands. To say too much - well, it was not our way,. and in the end there wasn't much to say;. the scars are healed now anyway. and there's no pain. . a dry river in the blazing sun . .. And Abraham rose, took his only son, and knife and tinder. in his hand, and setting out across the desert and up into. the scrubland hills, he bound the boy Isaac to the stone,. raised the blade and waited for the miracle.. But the wind blows silent across the hills, across the dead and the empty hills,. dead, like the god that never came,. like your face, the day that you turned away.."
no rest,"Chorus:. Four o'clock in the morning and still we cannot sleep. Turning over turning round, twisting in our sweat. They say there is no rest for the wicked ones. Dear God what have we done?. There is no rest for the wicked ones. Dear God what is this evil that we've done?. Is it that we wanted more than you gave?. Why did you put us then in this smalltown grave?. Humility - is that what you want?. Why did you make us then the way you did?. Yes we have pride - is this our sin?. Is it the times that we've been out fighting?. Well I'll tell you all those times - we never really hurt anybody. Or is it that we were eating. While other people were starving?. Is this our crime?. Chorus:. Four o'clock in the morning and still we cannot sleep . .. Is it the times we laughed about it all."
no sense,"Are we still not speaking?. Bitter words leave such a bitter taste. Yes, I meant to hurt you. But it was never meant to go as far as this. And still I can make no sense out of these things that I do. And I still put myself through this version of hell. Just put you through it too. Yes, I know I started it. But you shouldn't say those things you say. I always thought people were meant to learn by their mistakes. But it never seems to work out that way. Nothing's ever good enough for me or good enough for you. So I still drag myself through this version of hell. Just to drag you through it too. Sweat on the dancefloor. Blood from the broken glass. No favours ever given, no favours ever asked. This strange kind of communion. As these empty words are played."
nothing dies easy,"I’m like a gambler in a velvet-curtained room. Half-light and shadow, nothing is moving. I’m playing but I know that I’m losing. Good money after bad. I fooled myself that her number was lucky. I stare at my phone, my phone stares back at me. I feel my fingers pushing down at the keys. Good faith after bad. And nothing dies easy, it holds on until the end. It takes all of your power to push the blade in. A last glow in the ashes, a last spark in the eye. Breaking the glamour, breaking the spell. Breaking another wild part of myself. Breaking the glamour, breaking the spell, breaking the will. Every sound you hear is the sound of. Something praying for more life to be given. For maybe just another precious second. And every junkie I’ve known trying to do straight time. Leaves a little piece of their soul behind. You can’t shed your skin like you think you can, like I think I can. And nothing dies easy, it holds on until the end. It takes all of your power to push the blade in. The last glow in the ashes, a last spark in the eye. Breaking the glamour, breaking the spell. Breaking another bad part of myself. Breaking the glamour, breaking the spell, nothing dies easy. So a toast to the mercy killings. For all these cursed obsessions. For all the useless passions. For when I’m shot and gone. Because nothing dies easy, it holds on until the end. It takes all of your power to push the blade in. The last glow in the ashes, a last spark in the eye. Breaking the glamour, breaking the spell. Breaking another wild part of myself. Breaking the glamour, breaking the spell, breaking the will"
nothing touches,"We drive in silence beneath the grey dawning skies. Past the cooling towers where the white clouds slowly rise. I watch the world through motionless eyes. Nothing touches . nothing ever touches. Raised as son of Empire, hardened like a piece of steel. I am the master now of all that I can see. This means so much to you but nothing much to me. Nothing touches . nothing ever touches. Please take me home - I am very young. Please take me home.. And yes I heard you screaming as you walked out of my door. And yes I've seen those bloody faces picked up from the floor. I feel nothing and yet I understand it all."
notice me,"I'll take any drug in the whole damn world if you'll only notice me. Mainline poisons by the score - please will you notice me. I'll break any law, hurt anybody - for God's sake notice me. Cut my wrists and slash my face for Christ's sake notice me. I'll drink anybody into the ground if you'll only notice me. I'll kick the teeth out of anyone here - come on and notice me. I'll wear the clothes and cut my hair - please will you notice me. I'll be a pop star and I'll stand on stage - for God's sake notice me. Ch: Who told him that it mattered?. Who told him that anyone cared?. He's got an overgrown sense of his own importance. No one's really bothered around here. He was such a quiet boy, never any trouble before . .. I'll get a big car and drive like a maniac - please notice me. I'll make a lot of money and tread on you if you'll only notice me. I'll tell you any lies you want to hear - for God's sake notice me."
one bullet,"In a ring of men, with money changing hands. All the gypsy kings, they were gathered from miles around. I was tapped on the shoulder, stripped to the waist. But I was quick, quicker than all of them. I watched him fall, then he staggered back. There was blood on my hands, but my face was intact. I picked up all my money and I walked away. It was like I was chosen, but I did not choose. I was in love, just the one time. It was years ago, I still have her photograph. I look at it sometimes, when I'm on my own. I think of her sometimes, when I'm on my own. We fought the once and she went down. I'm sorry now, but you can't go back. I was wrong and I have paid. Carry it with me for the rest of my days.. Do you keep one bullet left for yourself. For when it's all over and done?. My grandmother's house, it's all empty now. I live here alone, nobody bothers me. I work on shift down at the bakery. And I fix up the house and I try to be happy. My father's rage is still in me. I bury it down where nobody sees. Everyone knows me here, but they don't speak. Maybe that's just the way that I like it to be. Do you keep one bullet left for yourself. For when it's all over and done?. I've gone to ground - just like the animals. In the fading light where all men go."
one of the chosen,"It was I that was lost and they that were searching. It was I that was weak and they had the power. So I went with the others to the bus that was waiting. And we drove out for miles to a place in the country. We were ten to a room, the windows don’t open. We were woken for prayer at four in the morning. All wired with hunger and energy crackling. And through the corridors I could hear chanting…. The hall was lit with candles and all the light was golden. And I felt something bursting, something down inside me. Singing out aloud about God and Love and Healing. And everything was moving and I’m on the floor kneeling. I am part of something I am one of the Chosen. I am part of something I am one of the Chosen. There is something in us all that wants to surrender. To be guided through it all like star-eyed children. And I hated the world as I’ve come to know it. And they hated the world with just the same vengeance. And I wanted reasons and they gave me reasons. And I wanted purpose, they gave me purpose. And here from the inside all the lights are blazing. And the view of the old world is dull and grey and joyless. Let it burn inside me, let it burn inside me. Let it burn inside me, let it burn inside me. Now we are the Holy Fools, we are the fearless. We are the Holy Fools we are the fearless. And I am part of something I am one of the Chosen. I am part of something I am one of the Chosen"
orange tree roads,"It was late, we were driving home in the rain. I thought I saw something flying across the two-lane. It was white like an angel - or like curse. There and gone in a second in front of us. In our house all the trophies are gathering dust. All the things we remember - but only just. We won't need them anymore. Chorus:. Once we were lost but we can be found. On the Orange Tree trail, on the roads heading south. Standing in the sun, in the fields of grain. Will you still love me when everything is changed?. In the shadows of the mountains we were watching the sky. Hale Bopp flying motionless out across the night. You turned to me and said with a smile. Everything these days seems to be some kind of sign. No one cares anymore where you've been. So you find a quiet place to shed that old skin. You won't need it again. Chorus:. Once we were lost but we can be found. On the Orange Tree trail, on the roads heading south. Standing in the sun, in the fields of grain."
over the wire,"Behind all the rusting cranes, in the lengthening shadows of the Empire days. there's a world that waits, but it's not needed.. In the teeming rows behind the goal - yelling for blood on the pitch below;. where does all the passion go when it's not needed?. Over the wire, and into the darkness . .. Come evangelists of the Grand New Age proclaiming the future that they stole,. condemning the things they can't control - just like the priests before;. and now I can hear them call - the ghosts of the 1914-18 war. Where do all the innocents go when they're not needed?. Over the wire and into the darkness . .. And the dawn it will come like blood across the sky,. Not the way that you think, not the way that you dream. In the silence of God, in the fullness of time,. like blood across the sky - the dawn it will come - the dawn it will come.. All still, like the pitshafts and the two-mile-down where they buried their hearts;. where does all the loyalty go when it's not needed?. In the plastic seats behind the goal yelling for blood on the pitch below;. where does all the passion go when it's not needed?."
paekakariki beach,"I saw you walking away from the battlefield. Through the clearing smoke to the other side. Lay down your weary head. And gazing up two ocean birds are wheeling, turning. Paekakariki Beach on the other side. By the green of the hills and the rolling tide. I lay down in the ashen sand. And high above the ocean birds. were wheeling, turning, circling, flying. And you have seen too much. Too many causes lost and won. The wild desires all drowned in the seven seas. And so we walk away from the battlefield. Through the clearing smoke to the other side. Lay down in the morning sun. and high above the ocean birds are."
poison street,"We were singing in the rain - like we invented singing. There's a light in the sky from a million street lights. And we danced all the steps from all those old time movies. Rolling down the hill with laughing hearts. In Poison Street they guard the gates with bitter, bitter tongues. In Poison Street we'll laugh out loud until the shadows go melt away. And I love you now like I love you always ever. Kissing in the dark like a couple of kids. You gave me life, you gave me light and thunder. Like a blind man sees for the very first time. In Poison Street we'll go crashing through the walls that history made for us. In Poison Street we'll spring the traps and race away. Chorus:. So just a kick for this dark damned city of ours. And a kiss, yeah a kiss for you. And just a drink, a toast to the days to come. Now Poison Street won't break us any more. We were singing in the rain - like we wrote that song. There's a light in the sky from the streetlights all around. You gave me life, you gave me light and thunder. Like a man makes fire for the very first time."
prison,"The curtain breathes, the air swims. The sweat dries cold on the shivering skin. The sheets they twist and turn again, round and round. My mother she feeds and cares for me. Shackled to responsibility. All her precious dreams for me crashing down. Ch: Tell them all to go away, tell them all I'll be OK. Tell them all just not today, not today . .. They're building special facilities. Laboratory animals die for me. I live with my humility - humility. November 1989, they're dancing on the Berlin Wall tonight. I feel the flow of history and have no part. Ch: Tell them all to go away, tell them all I'll be OK. Tell them all just not today, not today . .. A little night in town we said - oh I remember very well. They'll be out of prison soon and me I'm locked forever in this . .. I went for my mother to a holy shrine. The wheelchairs rattled through the afternoon. Over the cobbles and up the hill. In an ordered procession of desperate will. It hurts just the way it hurts today. Those moments come, then recede away. Better to accept what you cannot change. The less the pain . .. Ch: Tell them all to go away, tell them all I'll be OK."
pull the sun,"Impossible desire, impossible the dream. We lined them all up together and set off on the chase. Now the years they are gone like thieves in the dark. Did your eyes follow after them into the night?. I watched you as you tried and tried. To pull the sun from out of the sky. The colours all run and the clouds collide. But that was never enough. And me, I've got a black place in my heart. My favourite chord, my favourite card. That I draw every time on these occassions. If you leave a fire to burn it will burn itself away. It's a long way back through the dirty waters for you and me. And you're still haunted by the hands. All is letting you go. And if I told you not to look, would you do that for me this one time?"
purity,"The rains move in eastwards, in waves of succession. Drawing lines of grey across the sky. With history just as close as a hand on the shoulder. In hunger and impatience we cry. The battle against corruption rages in each corner. There must be something better, something pure. And the call it is answered from the caves to the cities. Come the dealers of Salvation on Earth. We've seen the restless children at the head of the columns. Come to purify the future with the arrogance of youth. Nothing is as cruel as the righteousness of innocents. With automatic weapons and a gospel of the truth. Ch: Revolution for ever, succession of the seasons. Within the blood of Nature, all raised to rot and die. This purity is a lie. Now immaculate conception in sterilised laboratories. How the vanity goes on. Or in the message of the preacher with his morals and obsessions. The wars that we wage upon ourselves. Purity is a virtue, purity is an angel. Purity is for madmen to make fools of us all. So forgive yourself my friend, all this will soon be over. What happened here tonight is nothing at all. Ch: Revolution for ever . .. I will always see Brendan at that broken down piano. His fingers thick and red, shaking on the keys. Battered by the years of alcohol and working. Still playing with the faith that never leaves. So sit us down, buy us a drink, tell us a good story. Sing us a song we know to be true. I don't give a damn that I never will be worthy. Fear is the only enemy that I still know."
qasr el nil bridge,"Come, tell me, ibrahim. about this day that you'll remember. Tell the story over to be sure it really happened. How you gathered in a circle. to protect your kneeling brothers. Amid the howling of the sirens. and the stutter of the gunfire. Ahmed shaking hands coming late into the square. Clean clothes and looking good. for the people's revolution. For you cannot choose a time. you may be chosen for a martyr. Pushing through the soldiers, smile as wide as ever. And at night on the great river the party boats pass. And the music and lights float away in the darkness. We're sailing with only the sound of our voices. and the water. And the man pulls on his cigarette. and pulls the boat round. And we all fall forward, tumbling and laughing. And the bright-eyed boy watches his father. Listening and feeling and learning to read the wind. 250 Miles south-west and into the sahara. The white stone figures tower away to the horizon. I'm like a pawn in a chess game gazing up in fear. For in these great games of power. they sacrifice their children. And in the black velvet night, we built our little fire. And watched the desert foxes daring to come closer. Our broken conversations eaten by the silence. Just the crackle of the flames. and a billion stars above us. And they tell me God is great but this I've never doubted. We each find wonder in the sky and the mountains. In the waves of people gathered and waiting. Listening and feeling and learning to read the wind. Lazy flies, sugar sweet teas. Winter chill, flame-fire trees. The great eucalyptus watching and waving. As the crowds come now from every direction. They tell me God is great but this I've never doubted. We each find wonder in the sky and in the mountains. In the hot scalding winds that will come from the desert. Hot enough for drying all the blood that has fallen. And at night on the great river the party boats pass. And the music and lights float away in the darkness. We're sailing with only the sound of our voices. and the water. And the man pulls on his cigarette and pulls us around. And we all fall forward, tumbling and laughing. And the bright-eyed boy watches his father. Listening and feeling and learning to read the wind"
queen of my heart,"To the Queen of my Heart, from the King of Nowhere. I have watched you arming, and how you wave your sword in the air;. always fighting the shadows as they move behind you,. and the beating wings that hover around you . .. To the queen of my heart, from the king of nowhere. It's a shallow sky that holds us in; you can reach right out. and touch the edge with just one outstretched hand and feel. the dark come closing in.. And there's nowhere far enough away from here;. the ringing ears and the closing air, and the cities and deserts all beat the same;. the radio waves crackle and phase, the satellites spinning slowly round.. The radar towers search and call. to the Queen of my Heart, from the King of Nowhere . .. This is the great world calling to the last crusader;. In the rush of the lifeblood coming out of the sunrise . .."
r.i.p,"This all started the way things do. With a laugh and a cup of tea around the fire. As we sheltered from those wicked winds in front of that old TV. And we traded ideas as we watched each other with those ambitious bright eyes. Those eyes that saw every detail of the world so clear. And we bided our time impatiently until the hunger really burned. And the softest sweetest kisses were lost amidst the thunder in our hearts. We watched the people round us getting up, getting on, getting old. But the game we were going to play so well - we'd get to stay young forever. To begin with they just smiled and stepped around our little fire. But remember how pretty soon that all began to change. But now bitter in this great city all the little children should go home. Because the big men want to make deals. When they find you've got something they want. The party's gone, the party's done, the party's over children. You'd better go home. Funny how they all come running if you let your pockets jangle a little. And there's that strange queasy feeling. Every time someone holds a door open for you. Such sweetness, such kindness - while they manoeuvre you into position. And we all know how hard it is to bite the hand that feeds you. Remember all those old films we used to watch every Friday night on TV. However fast you run, however slow the Mummy walks. It always catches you in the end. The party's gone, the party's done, the party's over children. You'd better go home. This ain't no place anymore for little girls or little boys. Not unless you want them to spoon-feed you all your life. The party's gone, the party's done, the party's over children. This dream is gone, this dream is dead, this dream is over, children."
rainy night,"It's a silent scream in rain town. How far have we fallen now?. And the rain come, wash away. The promised land that is here to stay. We came back, things left undone. Like uncut stone. And little breathes and nothing fills,. Things broken.. Still, we're all looking for it. Still looking for it. It's a silent scream in rain town. My shadow hunts without me now. In for the kill, in for the kill. Still, we're all looking for it. Still looking for it. Now half killing ourselves."
refugee,"My room is dark, and very small;. there's a place to wash at the end of the hall.. I hear strange languages through the wall,. I hear them shouting in the street below.. I listen now to anything, anything at all;. just to keep the ghosts away, not to let them come.. Lusala, she was the first to hit the ground,. running up the hill at the side of the house. One by one, in the screaming sun, my family fell,. the air alive with bullets, and the smell of fear.. Don't look back, don't look back, don't look back at all:. Their bloodied faces are here with me, now, in the room. Until the lights go out and the silence comes. don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep, just keep on running;. keep running, keep running, keep running, run, run, run . .."
rivers,"And so I came to this dream-like place. But I can’t remember how. Our lives just break open in front of us. Like pack ice before the bow. I followed rivers, I followed orders. I followed prophets, I followed leaders. I followed rivers, I followed highways. I followed conscience, I followed dreamers. And I’m back here, and I’m back here. At the edge of the sky. And so I came to this dream-like place. But I can’t remember why. I was never quite ready for what came my way. But I’ve always been ready to die. I followed rivers, I followed orders. I followed prophets, I followed leaders. I followed rivers, I followed highways. I followed conscience, I followed dreamers. And I’m back here, and I’m back here. At the edge of the sky. I sowed the seeds – I sowed the seeds. I followed rivers, I followed orders. I followed prophets, I followed leaders. I followed rivers, I followed highways. I followed conscience, I followed dreamers. And I’m nearly there, I’m nearly there"
running in the rain,"So many words are spoken. Round and round and round and round. So many confidences broken in this town. Too many cigarettes, I don't want to feel like this anymore. I go running, running in the rain. The television programmes. Go round and round and round and round. Oh God, I wish you were still here. Oh yes, I'm sorry for what I said. I love you, but I still wish you were dead. Now I'm running, running in the rain. So much time for thinking. Round and round and round and round. The boys all go drinking just to shut it out. Out here in the storm. You know that you're alive."
see you in hell,"As we touched down on the tarmac, they strode out to greet us. It was under a blue snake-skin sky. With a handshake of welcome, they set their agenda. With their smiles never touching their eyes. We've been here before on the edge of a promise. Surrender is all that remains. But we'll see them in hell, we'll see them in hell. We'll see them in hell before then. You made me a coward - I can't stand what I've become. What I most of all regret is not what I did. But all the things that I left undone. Like nobody learns, and nothing is changed. You ask me to follow again. But I'll see you in hell, see you in hell."
seven times,"There are lines of hills around us. I'm back in my father's land. Billowing clouds and the lazy old wind blows. Bringing the turning and all of the change. Seven times sun, seven times rain. It's been too long since I walked with you. Through the woods and the city streets. When I feel you running through my veins. I have no fear of what is to come. Seven times rain, seven times sun. We are what the gods have made us. We can go consenting through the world. We can watch our children growing away. Into the people that they'll become. Seven times rain, seven times sun. I have a friend on the other side. We smile across the wire. But we never could decide on. Who was to be abel and who was cain. Seven times sun, seven times rain. And I'm ok up here flying. I just don't know where to land. It took me nearly a lifetime to understand. The world has no anchor and no chains. Just seven times sun, seven times rain"
sex (the black angel),"Look at my eyes - you know what it is. I want you, I want you. The way your body moves beneath that dress. And all the nights I've spent away alone in sleeplessness. It's a hunger that we can fill. Racing, racing. And every nerve tingles with it. I want you, I want you. You know the way that I can make you feel. Of all the faces in the crowd, there's only you. Pull down your hair a little. Open up your mouth a little. You're beautiful, you're the best. This feeling that you know oh so well. Your oldest friend from the fires, the fires of hell. And I want you now. Driving down. Driving down. Into the fires. Every stretch and move is like a dream. Eating, biting, scratching. And all there is, is these racing pulses. And the breathing. Forget all the lies that they gave to you. Believe in this 'cause how could this feeling not be true."
shot 18,"Thou shalt not kill - remember that?. You learnt it again and again when you were young. They said weapons have this safety catch. Your moral conscience tells you kid what's right, what's wrong. Well they make out like they're so surprised. But it's easy when you're civilised. Count to ten, close your eyes. The way it's always been . .. Shot 18. I think I was a bit surprised. I never knew I was so anaesthetised. And triggers pull so lightly and people die so easy. I never realised. Well I believe in common laws. I believe in even scores. I understand the rules of war. The way the slate is cleaned . .. Shot 18. Who wants another Christian martyr?. Who wants someone else's pain?. Who wants the world on their shoulder?. Who wants to have to cry in vain?. Who wants to have an open sore. Eating away deep inside you?. Who wants to torture themselves. When there's plenty eager to do it for you?. Well, years might heal all the scars. But I don't know if you feel like you have that time. And if I was the man that killed your father. And if I said I'm sorry, would that change your mind?. Well no one should be so surprised. That words don't pay for victims' lives. It's teeth for teeth, eyes for eyes. The way it's always been . .."
sky in your eyes,"Between the chords of a song years ago. You saw a crack of light or was it a cause to follow?. You’ve been chasing ever since around these streets. For just the promise of a promise and nothing more to keep. You drove us like a crazy man through those narrow cobbled streets. You said ’there’s nothing to fear’ and we all smiled. Round and round in that little car while the city lay asleep. The city lay asleep. With sky in your eyes, shy in your eyes. The next day we went up to a ruined temple. high on a cliff above the opal sea. And watched as the angry storms chased around the bay. and suddenly the wind rose up and the thunder cracked. and you looked like you were home with your. weather-beaten face fixed in some kind of ecstasy. When the lightning hit the road just a few yards away. We all jumped up and shouted out but you never moved. Just stared ahead like you’d seen a ghost. So who was the ghost?. One part left behind, one part already gone. And one part standing here with sky in your eyes. With the sky in your eyes, with the sky in your eyes. If they won’t make you captain then you sail your own ship. With your own colours tied to the mast. Setting sail for the far side of anywhere. Beyond and behind your thousand yard stare. With the sky in your eyes, with the sky in your eyes"
smalltown england,"Turn left at the lights about 50 yards down. There's a pub in the corner and I'll meet you inside. About quarter to eight and we'll go into town. And find out what everybody's been saying about us. Smalltown walls have eyes and ears. Stories fly thick and fast round here. Truth and lies are all the same. Whatever you do don't rock the boat. You've got to play the game, play the game. Chorus:. Is it a crime to want something else?. Is it a crime to believe in something different?. Is it a crime to want to make things happen?. To spit in the faces of the cynical fools. The incrowd know that the shell is thin. So they all protect the cage they're in. Get drunk and stoned and wrecked again. No tears of rage, no cries of pain. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. In smalltown England. Because the world outside the pint in hand. Is all so hard to understand. And if visions of the world come clear. They're not allowed to interfere. Chorus:. Is it a crime to want something else? . .. The smell of hot food from the takeaway curry. Diesel fumes from a passing lorry. Waiting in the queue in the pouring rain. For the chip shop up on Bowling Lane. Well, last week we all got really smashed. We couldn't stand up, it was a real laugh. And this week's going to be just the same. And the next and the next, again and again. They say you've got to have fun while you're young."
snelsmore wood,"I woke still half-dreaming I was falling out of the trees. and tumbling down into the sky. It's cold, so cold sometime before dawn. searching for a light and reaching round for my clothes. That we believe, so must call, rise. The convoys roll into the coming daylight. Let it not be said that everything must die. without some mark being made of its passing. Chorus:. As if all the world should now hold its breath. These are the days that we'll recall. when the masks are off the faces. and there's something to fight for. All the lines drawn down in the Soul. You can let your anger burn crazy. There's talking-drums echoed down towards the Kennet Canal. and wood-smoke sweet on the air. And the Yellow Jackets stand with the Thick Blue Line. backs to the woods in the fresh thin carpet of snow. Snelsmore Wood, The Chase, Enbourne Road. Reddings Copse, Tothill down through Andover Grove. Let it not be said that everything must die. without some mark being made of its passing. Chorus:."
someone like jesus,"I met someone like Jesus in the spring of '98. He was so full of love and I was so full of hate. So I nailed him on a cross where he belonged. told myself it's what he would have wanted all along. and I drove into the night looking for something to burn. Oh how I love these little parables that I never cared to learn. And I don't know what this feeling is but it's just dripping through me. There's always something in the corner of my life that I cannot quite see. And I'm not sleeping well, all my dreams are so real. I dreamed I set fire to my house, watched the great beams come crashing down. And later on I was standing in the ashes of the stairs. They asked me what happened, it was an accident I said. And I don't know what all this means and I don't care, it's nothing to me. But there was something in the corner of that dream that I could not quite see. And there's a happy family snapshot when you were very small. But there were visits to the doctor, you can't remember what for. The curtains drawn in silence on a summer's afternoon. And the flies buzzing in the room. And you don't know what this feeling is and you can't explain it to me. But there was something in that family photo that you cannot quite see. And I don't know what all this means but it's just dripping through me."
southwest,"If I could save you, I surely would;. I'd take the world with you, the way we should.. I'd drown your violence in a sea of blood;. I'd drown the pain for you in the breaking waves,. I'd crown your innocence with the golden sun,. I'd drown your violence in a sea of blood . .. South-west bound on the winding A-roads - days of scorched brown rolling hills. and ripened fields, down to where the sun glistens on the sea beneath Pentire.. Diamond light, evenings becoming cool and fresh as the seasons change. I can't. wait to see you again - feels like something good is going to happen, as if reborn. in the last days of summer, burned to the core and then somehow, made young. once more - as if you were going to be the one crowned Harvest Queen.. All the black will fade away in glory days, and Indian summer;. you and I, sun and moon, different paths, always together;. all the black will fade away in the sharpened days that will soon be coming.. All love and change is one, all love and change forever . .. And I can feel it falling away,."
space,"You walk the thinnest of the ice, so easy to hurt. We drove through the dark in the pouring rain and barely said a word. So dress your wounds as best you can and close your tired eyes. Try to climb away from here towards the empty skies. And I'll meet you there, high above it all. In the kiss of air, the lover's breath. Visions rise from each little death. As Moses stands and turns his gaze away from the feuding tribes. Walks towards the mountains and through the rocks he climbs. God, he orders Moses - 'Bring the people to my will'. 'Leave me be' cries Moses, keeps on walking up the hill. And I'll meet you there, high above it all. In the kiss of air, the lover's breath. Visions rise from each little death. And should the Devil come and should he say -. 'All of this will I give to you, if you just bow down and worship me'. I'm on my knees.. ""The white twisted clouds and the endless shades of blue in the ocean. make the hum of the spacecraft systems, the radio chatter, even your. own breathing disappear. There is no cold or wind or smell to tell you. that you are connected to Earth.. You have an almost dispassionate platform - remote,. Olympian and yet so moving that you can hardly believe how. emotionally attached you are to those rough patterns shifting steadily below.""."
spirit of the falklands,"The natives are restless tonight, sir. Cooped up on estates with no hope in sight. They need some kind of distraction. We can give them that. 'Cause they'd kill if they only had something to kill for. They'd die if they only had something to die for. They'd cheer if they only had something to cheer for. We can give them that. So it's off to war we go (I couldn't believe it). Bring out all the flags (I never believed it). Fight the good fight. It's working like a dream, sir. Half the nation are hooked on the bait. Waiting for the next victorious instalment. We can give them that. 'Cause it's no surprise that young men are heroes. It's no surprise that young men are strong. It's no surprise that young men are foolish. We've known that all along. Exciting pictures on News at Ten (I couldn't believe it). Read all the crap on all the front pages (I never believed it). Fight the good fight. Chorus:. Dead men in the South Atlantic. It's meant to warm our hearts. They think that they died for you and me. Oh God, what a farce, what a farce. And now it's the repeats. Plugging the Falklands and the Falklands' spirit. Show the pictures again and again. Till the next war comes around. 'Cause we'll kill if we only have something to kill for. We'll die if we only have something to die for. We'll cheer if we only have something to cheer for. That is worthy of the name. Oh yes the next war (I never believed it). See the propaganda in TV fiction (I never believed it). Enemies with horns and tails. Chorus:. There are dead men in the South Atlantic. It's meant to warm our hearts. They think that they died for you and me. Oh God, what a farce, what a farce. There's crippled men back home in England. Doesn't it warm your hearts. They think they fought for peace and freedom."
stormclouds,"Well, my bags are packed, I'm ready to go. Whichever way the world is tilting. Because I won't get back the part of my soul. I sold to the devil for a coffee for the road. I never wanted to get anywhere. I never wanted to get anything. Desire is the point of everything. There's a line of shadows on the far horizon. It could be stormclouds and it could be mountains. All my life I've been gazing to the far horizon. It could be stormclouds and it could be mountains. I have never been a wise man. living too fast and recklessly. Too quick to judge, too quick to act and forgive and forget. And always gone before the reckoning. I grew up listening to the distant hum. Of the traffic on the great western road. Wishing I was gone. Screaming out to the wind - bring it on, bring it on. There's a line of shadows on the far horizon. It could be stormclouds and it could be mountains. All my life I've been gazing to the far horizon. It could be stormclouds and it could be mountains. Breaking open"
stranger,"When it comes down, we know we're alone. you could scream and nobody would hear. Today my face in the glass is a stranger's. furrowed with the lines of fear. All the little truths denied, all the little deaths we died. I always thought that it was worth something. All the little rays of hope, always coming back when we needed them most. I always thought that it was worth something. Once we went back to the house we were born in. The glass was smashed and there were boards on the doors. and it seemed so right that the past was all laid to waste. and our trail covered up and lost. All the little deaths we died, all the little truths denied,. I always thought that it was worth something. And all the battles leave their scars. and the gods of Fate still laughing at us. I always thought that it was worth what it cost. Let everyone else decide who's right - I don't care any more tonight."
stupid questions,"It's not a crime to be innocent, these things we have not done. But you're not some little child, spring is past and gone. Well I know my craving heart and I've seen your vicious eyes. And I think we know the truth, both you and I. Don't flutter your lashes like a little girl. And ask me why it's such a cruel, cruel world, no. Chorus:. Don't ask any more stupid questions. You already know the answers to. Well you can kill with the best of them but your smile remains so sweet. When someone comes to eat me alive, I like to see their teeth. If you really want I can name the names. Be an angel of death at the children's games, so. Chorus:. Don't ask any more stupid questions. You already know the answers to - I know that you do. There comes a time in your life you've got to grow up fast. And I think that your time is coming now here at last. It's not a crime to be innocent , these things we have not done. But you cannot run forever, spring is past and gone. Waiting in line at the fortune teller. Waiting to hear some more pretty lies, he says. Chorus:. Don't ask any more stupid questions."
summer moors,"You used to say that this town was built in a wrong place. I could always feel something was strange. such a strong taste. You were so much in love with her that it drew you away. To chasing shadows out across the moors. on an august day. So follow them down past the church where she lies. Pennistone fell and the path to the skies. They only said that you'd gone again. Maybe this time not coming back. Just another setting sun. Lost to the world, lost to the world. You were always trying to understand where the heart goes. With the ghosts rushing through the grass. as the wind blows. You were so much in love with her that it drew you away. For what is real and what is make-believe. well, who is to say?. So follow her down past the stone where she lies. Penistone fell and the path to the skies. They only said that you'd gone again. Maybe this time not coming back. Just another setting sun. Lost to the world, lost to the world"
sunrise,"We sang aloud into empty space. get ready 'cos here we come. Passing trucks lighting up your face. get ready 'cos here we come. Through a night of a billion stars. and hot coffee and the past receding. And now the road snakes. through the fields of mist and the dawn is slowly breaking. Sunrise - will you remember the golden fire?. Everybody has a favourite road. national 7 into the great wide open. It joins up all the points in time. the great loves and the lost and broken. We watched the fireworks bloom across the sky. high above the crowds all cheering. We lay awake until the town grew quiet. just holding breath and waiting for. Sunrise - will you remember, breaking east of eden. Sometimes the world works out the way you want it. Sometimes you say the things that you meant to say. Sometimes the moments break clear and certain. Sometimes the things you fear just roll away. So back here with my favourite song. get ready 'cos here we come. Straight ahead into the beautiful dawn. get ready 'cos here it comes. Sunrise - will you remember - I will, I will"
sunset,"Coming in at night all the desert highways. Crackle with the static of a thousand little radios. Everyone talking, no-one listening. Well by now I should expect that. Down into the city I smell artificial green. A glasshouse full of growing things. That are not what they seem to be. Look away, look away, the procession's leaving town. The emperor rides naked and no-one gives a damn. That was the last time. I get a morbid satisfaction watching Sunset in all its degradation. We were in a restaurant for wannabes clinking glasses in celebration. We had to leave before something bad occurred and Niko grabbed the keys. We drove out in the early morning with the radio jammed on R'n'B. Drive away, drive away, and he turned to me and smiled. Said, how does it feel to be living through the Fall of Rome. And I said it's beginning to feel OK. The last time. Well I gave you all my money. I'm ashamed to remember now just why I did that. I got bitter, I got jealous, but not as much as you. Do you understand that?. Ten hours drifting half awake and finally touching down. I went out in the rainy morning and kissed the blessed ground. Coming home, coming home and the most of it is done. And the worst of us is left behind in the place where it belongs."
tales of the road,"The caravan flipped over two, three times. Went spinning down the carriageway. Breaking up into splinters. Wheels turning around in the dust at the foot of the hill. And all the old clothes, the pots and pans and the photographs. The little things of those people's lives. Lay strewn across the road. Ch: We just want what we cannot have. We've driven so far, we can never get back. Sitting in the all night cafe in a curl of smoke. Telling tales of the road. By the glow of a flickering lighter. We went stumbling forward through the corridor. Up the broken stairway to the top of the trail of shattered glass. Damp mattresses in the doorway, an old abandoned take-away. Nothing much to tell us if and where you'd gone. By now you could be miles away. Ch: We just want what we cannot have. We've driven so far, we can never get back. Sitting in the all night cafe in a curl of smoke. Telling tales of the road. And everyone just keeps moving on, you turn around and find them gone. The lights go out one by one, the prodigal son is not coming home. Down at the Ferrybridge junction. Beneath the cooling towers a man stood hitching a ride. And in the long grass at the side of the road his son was laid asleep. He said - nothing's left to keep us in the city where we come from. Take us far away from here - looking for work and the wishing-well. This afternoon the sunlight spilled shadows across the golden hills. They searched us at the border but they're not looking for what we're hiding. They're not looking for what we're hiding. Ch: We just want what we cannot have. We've driven so far, we can never get back. Sitting in the all night cafe in a curl of smoke."
ten commandments,"Down comes Moses with the Ten Commandments. Hewn on a tablet, just the bitterest pill. Breaks up the party in the valley below. Says obey my orders and you're doing God's will. And disciples of Jesus, lost and forgotten. When the brand new faith isn't doing so well. Write the Book of Revelation to terrify the people. Join our religion or you're heading for hell. Ch: I will bow to the earth, bow to the sea,. Bow to the love between you and me,. Bow to the sun, bow to the land. But never to a god made in the image of man. Here comes Mohammed, back from the desert. Another male prophet with the word of the Lord. Shut off the women, lock them in darkness. Kill all opponents in a holy war. Here is murder, here is oppression. Here is the order that the Church demands. Burn three million women, call them witches and heretics. Then change the tune when the fashion demands. How they run to you now, how they grovel to you now. I think they're mad. How they subjugate their pride as if it's a sin to be alive. I think that's sad. Down with Moses and his Ten Commandments. Deader than deadest of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Back to the desert with Jesus and Mohammed."
tension,"Like a desert, so smooth. So calm, like velvet. Like wire, so taut. So stretched, like steel. The surface is rippling. And straining and cracking. From within. Like a bomb just ticking. And waiting like hours. And hours keep folding. And winding and stretching. And deep down inside. The foundations are tearing apart. And the holes are all gaping. Swallowing everything. Please take me out of this dream. Tension. Nightmares like circles. Of lies all hidden. Seething and smouldering. Under the covers. No fire, no passion. But uneasy silence. And peace. In terror I'm waiting. For the one great explosion. Please take me out of this dream."
the attack,"Now the talking's over, plans are laid and the hour is set. Glances round the table, eyes all shining, dark and bright. We meet again at daybreak for the day that will be ours. We're tomorrow's history. So just check your weapons, say your prayers.. Now the evening's over, voices muffled in the cold night mist. We leave the house together, home to rest up in the last few hours. Heads against the pillows with eyes that will not close. Of all the dreams that we've ever had. This is the one, this is the one. Now the night is over - dawn cracks open like a breaking shell. Now the waiting's over - as we walk in silence through the empty streets. We meet beneath the tower, greetings empty like the taste inside. Turn towards the valley and the day that has waited for us all our lives. Even in this age of concrete, even in this age of reason. There comes a time when you put your life."
the cause,"Headline in the paper tells of fighting in the streets. Teenage battles; six arrested. Mutters in the council chambers, something must be done. Before our city streets become infested. And mummy turns to daddy says ""where was our little boy that day. Why can't he just stay at home and watch the silver screen"". Ch: All we wanted was a cause that we could fight for. One chance for the heroes to win the day. All we wanted was a chance to see the world. In black and white instead of a hundred shades of grey. Watch the raving maniacs go carving up the night. See the barmy smiles on their faces. See the crazy bombers going cross their deadly wires. Blow themselves into a million pieces. The bands play it hard and fast go ripping through their sets. Adrenaline going flowing drink and no regrets. What do we tell our grandchildren. When they ask us about the good old days. Boring empty daytime jobs and frozen up inside. Do you not remember what your daddy told you long ago."
the charge,"Our history speaks in thunder from a thousand village halls. In blood and sweat and sacrifice, in honouring every call. So the forces gathered against the thorn a-piercing in their side. A brave new world is beckoning so the olden world must die.. In the offices of the city, at all the tables of oak and power. The snares are laid and baited for the approaching of the hour. A hundred justifications and the presses are ready to roll. The gateways to the nation they are firmly under control. Chorus:. On, on, on, cried the leaders at the back. We went galloping down the blackened hills. And into the gaping trap. The bridges are burnt behind us and there's waiting guns ahead. Into the valley of death rode the brave hundreds. We called for some assistance from the friends that we had known. But this is the 1980s and we were on our own. We never felt like heroes or martyrs to a cause. Just battle-weary soldiers in a bloody civil war. The massacre now is over and the order new enshrined. While a quarter of the nation are abandoned far behind. Their leaders offer the clich?words, so righteous in defeat. But no one needs morality when there isn't enough to eat. The unity bond is broken and the loyalty songs are fake. I'll screw my only brother for even a glimpse at a piece of the cake. We only cry in private here behind the shuttered glass. When we think of the charge of this brigade, the severing of the past. Chorus:. On, on, on, cried the leaders at the back. We went galloping down the blackened hills. And into the gaping trap. The bridges are burnt behind us and there's waiting guns ahead."
the hunt,"We went into town on the Tuesday night. Searching all the places that you hang about. We're looking for you. In the back street cellar dive drinking clubs. In the discotheques and the gaming pubs. We're looking for you. You will pay the price for my own sweet brother. And what he has become. And a hundred other boys and girls. And all that you have done. We picked up the trail at the Seven Crowns. One of your cronies, he was doing your rounds. We followed him. Just a silhouette figure up Market Pass. Where the headlamps shine on the broken glass. We followed him. Over the bridge by the old canal. Where the shadows dance on the lighted wall. He stopped to light up a cigarette. And we dived into a doorway. Chorus:. No police, no summons, no courts of law. No proper procedure, no rules of war. No mitigating circumstance. No layers fees, no second chance. There are lasses getting trouble on their own home beat. There are old folk battered in the open street. In this city of hours. There are eyes that see but say nothing at all. There are ears that hear but they don't recall. In this city of hours. So we followed your man back to your front door. And we're waiting for you outside. 'Cause not everybody here is scared of you. Not everybody passes on the other side. Chorus:. No police, no summons, no courts of law . .. And we could spend our whole lives waiting for some thunderbolt to come. And we could spend our whole lives waiting for some justice to be done."
the price,"Splashing through the water on the motorway. The headlights shine in every drop of rain. And every mile takes a minute and every minute lasts an hour. And there's so many miles until we're home again. And staring through the gathering mists on the windscreen. I know that paying the prices came so soon. But I swear that those eyes cut deeper into me. Than they'll ever cut into you. Chorus:. And still the fires won't go out. That no power of the mind can drive away. All I ever see are your eyes calling. And the hatred and the love and the passion and the pain. Everybody knows this feeling like an old friend. And everybody feels it the same. But out here in the dark there is no one else. Driving faster, faster through the rain. Chorus:. And still the fires won't go out. Am I trying to raise a toast when the glass is already empty?. Am I paying the price now the wasted years are through?. But I swear that those eyes cut deeper into me."
these words,"Through the years of decay we walk like tigers in cages. With each passing turn the smaller and smaller the circles. Every weapon and word legitimate now as protection. But these things should never be spoken. These things should never be spoken. I stand undefeated alone in the ring just pacing. The sweat and the blood dried on my hands all wasted. I'm shouting ""come back and fight for I am the king"". But the lights are all out and the people are gone. We always burned brightest when no one was watching. Now I kiss the lines on your beautiful face. But these things should never be spoken. These things should never be spoken. And sometimes your hunger for life seems like desperation. And when I read about the world these days all I can feel is hatred. The fortune teller is closing her doors. She looked into the crystal and saw nothing at all. They're waiting round here for something to happen. They won't really want it when it rolls out to greet them. But these things should never be spoken."
today is a good day,Today Is A Good Day. . This storm is beautiful. It breaks the breakable. It blows unstoppable. They had claimed victory. They look so stupid now. It's ashes in their mouths. There are new soft people. For the new soft winters. But they cannot touch us. I was taught not to cry. I do not need to cry. I can hold myself inside. So today is a good day. Today is a good day. We love to dress to kill. They gave us uniforms. They say they suit us well. But these rules are not agreed. They're only sophistry. They don't apply to me. So today is a good day. Today is a good day. And the birds of prey love September. Flying like the harbingers of the winter. Swooping down through the azure perfect sky. We're drifting weightless. (We push our trolleys down). Through the aisles of the Superstore. Like a couple of Stepford Wives. This joke is on us all. We all are laughable. We became what we despise. So today is a good day. Today is a good day
tomorrow came,"I was born in the spring. And raised as a child through the years. Of the great harvest. The last of the generation that blew away. The prison walls of the past. And we celebrated victory. Over the remains of the old order. By blasting into space, into the mountains. Into the forests and into the ice. We sang songs of love and freedom. And we vowed to protect the weak. Even as they were cast aside. For the follies of everlasting youth. Were to be our new religion. For each person's dream. Was to be made flesh and the world it was ours. As we slashed and we burned and laid waste to it all. To the glory and the vanity of rock and roll. Saying I want it all now. As our children stood and watched us in silence. Pray god they'll forgive us. So the seeds planted for the future. Withered even within our own lifetimes. For it was the ties we so hated and destroyed. That had made us strong. And the walls of every house now echo. With that old refrain. There must be more money, there must be more money. Remember all those songs of love and freedom. As if they were the same thing. Now we know they were not the same thing. They echo in empty beauty. Down through the boarded-up streets. To the sound of closing doors and locking of the gates. As we slashed and we burned and laid waste to it all. To the glory and the vanity of rock and roll. Saying I want it all now, give me more and more. As our children stood and watched us in silence. And now pray god they'll forgive us. They've started filming for the final scenes. We're still becoming what has already been. The stolen future and dissolving dream. Tomorrow never comes but tomorrow came. With the new day sun on our ageing skin. As we stand here naked. With our children's hungry eyes upon us. Pray god they'll forgive us"
trust,"Walking home on a foggy night. Walking home alone. Wishing there was power in my fingertips. To burn through this solid stone. How the hell am I supposed to know what mood you're in. When you're changing all the time. I thought we were meant to be in this thing together. Like partners in the perfect crime. It's up to you, it's up to you. If you won't trust me then there's nothing I can do. Well yes I've made my fair share of mistakes. Maybe a lot more than I should. But you listen to too much of that downtown talk. And you believe a lot more than you should. Well, it's up to you, it's up to you. If you won't trust me than there's nothing I can do. There's a battle to win and if you're not in."
turn away,"The candle flickers and the shadows move distorted on the wall. There's a wire slowly stretching. And now you ask him all the questions, the same ones as before. But you know that he is lying. And with your arms around him now, you're begging please. But he moves towards the open door. And you find you're screaming 'no'. But something breaks this time, you find you cannot move. Is it wrong to let him walk into the water?. Close your eyes for just one moment. You get so tired the endless days of watching over. And is it wrong as the waves boil up to greet him. To turn away - he disappears into the tide. All your love it cannot save him. All your love it cannot save him. And everybody holds a secret that draws them with its breath. The one that will destroy them. Oh, the warming glow of poison - it's so easy going down. Just to spite the days of reason. Oh, my abandoned child, we'll both end up as fools. I can see it in your craving eyes that I cannot hold you. All the warning shots will be lost and drowned. In the roar of the crashing waves. And is it wrong to let you walk into the water?. Close my eyes for just one moment. I get so tired the endless days of watching over. And is it wrong as the waves boil up to greet you. To turn away - you disappears into the tide. All my love it cannot save you."
understand u,"Chorus:. They don't understand you. None of them understand you. Tonight, as you stare at the ceiling again. With you lover turning away. Disappointment closing in like the walls. And you try, you try to talk about love. And they put their arms around you. But still you feel all alone - wonder why. Chorus:. They don't understand you. None of them understand you. And it doesn't have to be this way. I know you try to do the things they say. Just because you don't know what it is that you feel. Doesn't mean you can hide it away. Well you try to be less than you are but they know. Yes they know - and silence is a dangerous game. And words are dangerous too. And you've spoken the best that you can. Chorus:. They don't understand you. None of them understand you. And it doesn't have to be this way."
vagabonds,"We follow the taillights out of the city. Moving in a river of red. As the colours fade away from the dusky sunset. We roll for the darkness ahead. Chorus:. We are old, we are young, we are in this together. Vagabonds and children, prisoners forever. With pulses a-raging and eyes full of wonder. Kicking out behind us again. Night-time City Beat the radio is calling. The lost and lonely in vain. Out here we are running for the wide open spaces. The road-smell after the rain. Chorus:. We are old, we are young, we are in this together. Vagabonds and children, prisoners forever. With pulses a-raging and eyes full of wonder. Kicking out behind us again. And watching as a boy alone at the quayside. The ships loading cargo in the night. Their names all calling to faraway places. The years go past, the miles go by."
vanity,"I'll teach you everything that I know now, Eddie. If you really want to take the time. But don't expect to get answers to anything, Eddie. There is just one thing I've learned. Through everything that I've done and tried. Everything I have justified. It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control. It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all. I always drive like a madman, Eddie. But you'll soon get used to that. I believe if you're moving fast enough, Eddie. You don't ever have to watch your back. I choose solid ground to make my stands. I stay off the streets at closing time. It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control. It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all. Remember how it was out at Bunglass. We climbed up to the peak and stood against the rocks. The photographs came - you couldn't see us. We were lost against the mountains like specks of dust. And the mirror never lies, it's just these foolish eyes. And we all see what we want to see. What we need to see, what we have to see. And so will you do just the same one day, Eddie. I've been to that place a thousand times. Looked over the edge so many times. Wanted to jump a thousand times. Well we talk about saving the world now, Eddie. It's our vanity gone mad. She'll survive us all perfectly well. When we're all long buried and dead. Clever monkeys with technology. Barely out of the caves and the trees. It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control. It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all. Eddie now let it go . .. I turn my head away from here. Down towards the rolling seas again. I kneel and worship where I can."
vengeance,"Escaped the net in '45, hiding out in South America. Protected by money and powerful friends. Hoping the world has forgotten by now. All the things that you did in the Nazi Death camps. The people that you tortured and killed. You can live you life in expectant fear. Sure some day you'll be made to pay. Chorus:. I believe in justice. I believe in vengeance. I believe in getting the bastard. Man walks over dressed in flashy clothes. With an empty heart and a head full of money. Puts his arm around the lad of fifteen years. Talks sort of close like a long-lost brother. ""It's really cool, all the pop stars do. If you don't try a little you'd really be a fool. Tell you what I'll do, I'll make the first one free. And when you want some more just come back to me"". [Alternative version of second verse:]. Loading up the barrels at the warehouse gates. Men in overalls on double rates. Put the stuff in the river and away for a beer. Don't worry too much, they don't live around here. And the poison seeps into every pore. Every child's eyes, every innocent's sore. Everybody knows behind the closed doors. Kick down the doors, kick down the doors. Chorus:. I believe in justice. I believe in vengeance. I believe in getting the bastard. Top-dog fascist gets the boys in the corner. Plants poison where there was just confusion. Walks away scot-free and laughing. Rides on the tide as the cancer grows. And the business man on corruption charges. With millions of dollars in dirty money. Gets a thousand pound fine after months in court. While the lawyers get fat and the law gets bought. Chorus:. I believe in justice. I believe in vengeance."
waiting,"There's absolutely nothing on my mind. The television flickers in my eyes. Waiting, always waiting. Down at the bus station, doing time. We watch the world go passing by. Waiting, always waiting. It's all on tomorrow, don't worry today. Another year over but it's all okay. They told us of the Second Coming so we look to the sky. It's not a saviour we want, just someone else to crucify. Waiting, always waiting."
western dreams,"Gather round and listen and I'll tell you how's it's done. How they manage to make idiots out of everyone. Take a human population with their hunger and their pain. And the weaknesses that cripple them again and again. Invent a splendid party where dreams can be won. And with bright flashing lights, the heartaches are gone. With sex and with money and with everything for free. Then show tantalising glimpses every night on TV.. Watch the dirty hands that laboured hard for you. Stretching out like children for a crumb that they can chew. Give a car and video and a little bit to spare. And go on promising that more could all be theirs. Chorus:. All lies, all lies, all schemes all schemes. Every winner means a looser in the western dream. The producer swears silently it cannot be heard. And the camera crew are muttering those four letter words. Another take is needed so the show can go on. With a patronising smile and a popular song. They tell when to laugh, they tell you when to cheer. So the audience at home will get the right idea. They watch like children left out of a playground gang. Conforming their lives the way they hope will get them in. Chorus:. All lies, all lies, all schemes all schemes. Every winner means a looser in the western dream. It seems to me sometimes there's only two ways to choose. In this whirlpool made of a thousands years. Either live in these ghettos and know your place. Or you trample over everyone in the human race. I wish we could find another way to go. Without the Ghost of Cain in everything we do. The bitterness in failure and the dirt in success."
whirlwind,"I felt a shiver in the heat-haze and the waiting time is over. Strange tongues on the airwaves as the voices call from distant lands. I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other. And I'm in love with every strange unfolding day. As the storm begins to break cover. So let the whirlwind blow. - through the ice, the melting snows. - across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below. And so we shutter up the doorways as the ripples move towards us. For a moment stop breathing - She wakes and stirs beneath our feet. The Order try to stand their ground, while every battlefront is shifting. They still believe that they can hold the reins. But then they've got no sense of history. So let the whirlwind blow. - through the ice, the melting snows. - across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below. - the waters seething, bubbling out of control. - come on take my hand and we'll dive. A television blares in an empty room. The poisoned waters glisten. Goliath staggers round in a punch-drunk daze. Doesn't understand what hit him. I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other. And I'm in love with every strange unfolding day. As the storm begins to break cover. Let the whirlwind blow. - through the ice, the melting snows. - across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below. - the waters seething, out of control. - we watch the oceans rise and the governments start to fall. - across the freezing skies until the lights go out below."
white coats,"Well we know what makes the flowers grow - but we don't know why. And we all have the knowledge of DNA - but we still die. We perch so thin and fragile here upon the land. And the earth that moves beneath us, we don't understand. So we rush towards the Judgement Day, when She reclaims. A toast to the Luddite martyrs then, who died in vain. Down at the lab they're working still, finishing off. How do we tell the people in the white coats. Enough is enough?. Chorus:. Hey, hey I listen to you pray as if some help will come. Hey, hey She will dance on our graves when we are dead and gone. You and I we made no suicide pact - we didn't want to die. But we watch the wall, little darling, while the chemical trucks go by. This desperate imitation, now, of innocence. Those last few days at Jonestown ain't got nothing on this. Chorus:. Hey, hey I listen to you pray as if some help will come. Hey, hey She will dance on our graves when we are dead and gone. Now beneath the fitted carpets, beyond the padded cells. Within these crimes of passion, the naked truth She dwells. And this fury's just a part and this thunder's just a part. Desire is just a part - the cracking ice, the splitting rock. Chorus:. Hey, hey I listen to you pray as if some help will come. Hey, hey She will dance on our graves when we are dead and gone. Hey, hey to the suicide day, the blind man blunders on. Hey, hey She will dance on our graves when we are dead and gone. As children learn about the world, we built that wall of sand. Along the beach we laboured hard with our bare hands. We worked until the sun went down beneath the waves. And the tide came rolling splashing in, washed the wall away. How do we tell the people in the white coats."
white light,"It's another heroes' sunset. I'm riding on the Great North Road. Coiled and tensed in wonder. As the land turns burning gold. Chorus:. Out in the sun, out in the wind. I'm nearly ready now to come back again. We are silent in this worship. Beneath the breathing of the summer trees. They sparkle in a dance of silver. As the light falls through the leaves. Chorus:. Out in the sun, out in the wind. I'm nearly ready now to come back again. So from the wisdom of trances, the armies of Jesus. To the Voodoo possessions, the different disguises. At dusk in the mountains, all bowed in surrender. A thousand voices calling out a million names. We knelt as we lit the candles. Around the little shrine. Take me back to the white light. I want to go there again. Chorus:. Out in the sun, out in the wind."
whites of their eyes,"Raised in the fields in the back of beyond,. hauled into position as a prodigal son.. I was not Abel - I was a Cain;. the kind you find a use for every now and again.. I can't abide what things have become,. they think that you're simple, they think that I'm dumb. You want to know one thing I advise?. Shoot when you see the whites of their eyes.. They'll come to you in the perfect disguise. clock you too late, with a squeal of surprise. shoot when you see the whites, the whites of their eyes.. The wolf-child smiles in the shallowest dreams. and you don't know just what it means. Hey diddle diddle, what on earth can it be?."
wipe out,"This is where we go to - to the blue of the ocean. On the 30 westbound to the diamond water. Lost out in the white waves - salt purification. Bright eyes and breathless - this is how Love feels. Wash away the black stuff, wash away the road-dirt. In the thrill of the wipe-out, feel it pulling you under. This is where it saved your life in the days of the new beginning. All the sweet redemption lines that you wrote and told a thousand times. This is where we go to - to the blue of the ocean. On the 30 westbound to the diamond water. On the back-lanes down to the sea we pulled to the side of the road. Danced together in the headlights beam to the songs on the radio. Cheek to cheek . .. We're up on the cliff tops as the dusk falls and the wind drops down,. the last of the light fading in the sky out to the west;. and far out to sea, the water glows iridescent, perfect, like a promise. of warm water in the shallows, cold water out in the deep,."
wired,"At the witching hour we’ll be gone from here. When the snake-black roads are just about clear. Onto the hard-line dark horizon. Through the silver in the air. And if home is where the heart is. We’ll just keep going until we disappear. The moon rides high on a gunmetal sky. Blood of a river a mile wide. I am wired, I am wired, I am so wired. The moon rides high on a gunmetal sky. Blood of an ocean, rising tide. Into the wild, into the wild, into the wild. Sometimes I feel her with me,. I feel her eyes upon my face. I feel her pulling me down in a tangle. Of sweat and hair and grace. For the only things worth wishing for. Are the ones that you cannot possess. The moon rides high on a gunmetal sky. Blood of a river a mile wide. I am wired, I am so wired, I am so wired. The moon rides high on a gunmetal sky. Blood of an ocean, rising tide. Into the wild, into the wild, into the wild. And in the shadows of the trees. You can see like an animal sees. You can gather up the stars like seeds. And through them back into the night"
wonderful way to go,"The wolf he howls, howls up at the moon,. out on the steps beneath my hotel room.. Was in the woods behind this little town. we went flying up through the silhouette trees,. then crashing down. Colours brighter than I've ever seen,. More wired than I've ever been - and the faces turn to stone . .. On through the gates again - what a wonderful way to go . .. What a wonderful way to go.. Tell me your story, tell me no lies;. we touch each other - but only with our eyes.. Some kind of game, to play with desire;. it's just beneath the skin that I'm alive.. Colours brighter than I've ever seen - more wired than I've ever been. And the faces turn to stone - on through the gates again;. what a wonderful way to go - what a wonderful way to go.. Tonight the moon, she lays a silver path across the blackened sea,. I'm swimming out against the tide, the waves are breaking over me;. and deep beneath the waters in the darkness I can hear her. as she calls for me to come. .. The wolf he howls, howls up at the moon;. some day coming - some day soon. Onto his shoulder, to carry me home;. flying up through the silhouette trees and we'll be gone. Colours brighter than I've ever seen - more wired than I've ever been;. And all the faces turn to stone - on through the gates again . .."
you weren't there,"Well, you say it's such a small, small world. flying Club Class back from the far-east. curled up safe and warm in the big chair. you were drifting through the skies of anywhere. Get the courtesy car to the Sheraton. there's live on-the-spot reports on the CNN between the ad-breaks. so you think you know what's going on - but you don't. because you weren't in Belfast, no you weren't there. and no you weren't in Waco, no you weren't there. and you weren't in Kosovo, you weren't there. and you weren't in my head so you don't know how it felt. walking arm in arm with crowds to the square. and the banners waving and the sun glinting. All this information swims round and round. like a shoal of fish in a tank going nowhere. Up and down between the glass walls. You're so safe in the knowledge they're impenetrable. and you look out at the world and see nothing at all. so go back to sleep and you'll be woken when the time comes. and you'll never know just what hit you or where it came from. because you weren't in Bradford, no you weren't there. and you weren't on the hill, no you weren't there. and you weren't with us so you never saw. just what happened when the television crews came knocking on the door. how the people told them all to go to Hell,. smashed the cameras and sent them away. There were sirens going off and policemen coming in. and all that you love was being swept away. in the rush of a black tide all done in your name. and you'll never know just what happened there."
