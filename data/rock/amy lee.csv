love exists,"It can be born anywhere. In the last place you'd expect. In a way you'd never dream. It can grow from nothing. And blossom in a second. A single glance is all it takes. To get inside you. Invading every thought. And every bit of your heart. Love can make you scream. and it can leave you speachless. Love has a thousand stems, but only one flower. It can grow alone till it turns into dust. It can tear your world apart. Or bind to you forever. It can grow in darkness, make its own light. Turn a curse into a kiss. change the meaning of your words. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear, love has no reason. So infinitely vast and we're standing on the edge. Take my hand and erase the past forever. My love is you, my love you are. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love is never wrong and never needs a reason. I'm drowning in my tears. But my heart's on fire. It can make you better, it can change you slowly. And give you everything you want. Ask for nothing in return. In the blink of an eye, the hint of a smile. In the way you say goodbye. And everytime you find me. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear, love has no reason. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear, love has no reason. My love is you, my love you are. My love is you, my love you are"

going to california,"Spent my days with a woman unkind. Smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine. Made up my mind to make a new start. Going to California with an aching, in my heart. Someone told me there's a girl out there. With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair. Took my chances on a big jet plane. Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same. The sea was red and the sky was grey. Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today. The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake. As the children of the sun began to awake.

Runs straight and high. High. To find a queen without a king. They say she plays guitar and cries and she sings. Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn. Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born. Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams. Telling to myself it's not as hard, as it seems"

To get inside you. Invading every thought. And every bit of your heart. Love can make you scream. and it can leave you speachless. Love has a thousand stems, but only one flower. It can grow alone till it turns into dust. It can tear your world apart. Or bind to you forever. It can grow in darkness, make its own light. Turn a curse into a kiss. change the meaning of your words. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear, love has no reason. So infinitely vast and we're standing on the edge. Take my hand and erase the past forever. My love is you, my love you are. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love is never wrong and never needs a reason. I'm drowning in my tears. But my heart's on fire. It can make you better, it can change you slowly. And give you everything you want. Ask for nothing in return. In the blink of an eye, the hint of a smile. In the way you say goodbye. And everytime you find me. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear, love has no reason. Love makes no sense, love has no name. Love drowns you in tears. And it sets your heart on fire. Love has no fear, love has no reason. My love is you, my love you are. My love is you, my love you are"
