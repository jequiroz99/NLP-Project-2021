what goes around,"Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?. You know I gave you the world. You had me in the palm of your hand. So why your love went away. I just can't seem to understand. Thought it was me and you babe. Me and you until the end. But I guess I was wrong. Don't want to talk about it. Don't want to think about it. I'm just so sick about it. Can't believe it's ending this way. Just so confused about it. Feeling the blues about it. I just can't do without ya. Tell me is this fair?. Is this the way it's really going down?. Is this how we say goodbye?. Should've known better when you came around. That you were gonna make me cry. It's breaking my heart to watch you run around. 'Cause I know that you're living a lie. That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find.... What goes around, goes around, goes around. Comes all the way back around. What goes around, goes around, goes around. Comes all the way back around. Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed. You said that you were moving on now. And maybe I should do the same. Funny thing about that is. I was ready to give you my name. Thought it was me and you, babe. And now, it's all just a shame. And I guess I was wrong. Don't want to talk about it. Don't want to think about it. I'm just so sick about it. Can't believe it's ending this way. Just so confused about it. Feeling the blues about it. I just can't do without ya. Can you tell me is this fair?. Is this the way it's really going down?. Is this how we say goodbye?. Should've known better when you came around. That you were going to make me cry. Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around. 'Cause I know that you're living a lie. That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find. What goes around, goes around, goes around. Comes all the way back around. What goes around, goes around, goes around. Comes all the way back around. And now you want somebody. To cure the lonely nights. You wish you had somebody. That could come and make it right. But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy. You'll see. (What goes around comes back around). (What goes around comes back around). (What goes around comes back around). (What goes around comes back around). You spend your nights alone. And he never comes home. And every time you call him. All you get's a busy tone. I heard you found out. That he's doing to you. What you did to me. Ain't that the way it goes. When you cheated girl. My heart bleeded girl. So it goes without saying that you left me feeling. hurt. Just a classic case. A scenario. Tale as old as time. Girl you got what you deserved. I thought I told you, baby. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told you, baby. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told you, baby. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told you, baby"

curse of the virgin canvas,"I am here to tell you a story. A story that will torture your thoughts by day and. poison your dreams by night. And though I will do my best,. There are no words that can be written. Nor brush strokes laid on canvas that can describe. This dark and utter horror of the night that annabel died. The emptiness will haunt you. This is a nightmare. Is my annabel really gone?. Why have I stopped my day oh,. I find it hard to breathe. Her body teases me. As the sun reveals the dawn. Her smile reflects the gold. I kissed a sharp painful lie. Baby lay in my arms. And cuddle me close. Soon this will be. Just an awful memory. (will I ever be able to sleep again?). My angel lie to me. And tell me I'm dreaming. (please wake me up, please wake me). A feel like you will always be. Such a tradgic part of me. (I'll watch to see you torture me). I watch the blood drip. From the corners of your mouth. The watch seems vicious for me. I'll frown and slit your throat. I'm starting to believe. What my eyes are seeing now. Eyes look so beautiful. And you know what I'll be now. Baby lay in my arms. And cuddle me close. Soon this will be. Just an awful memory. (will I ever be able to sleep again?). My angel lie to me. And tell me im dreaming. (please wake me up, please wake me). A feel like you will always be. Such a tradgic part of me. (I'll watch to see you torture me). Sweet, raffish. It will be. Mine. It will be. Done. Empty eyes accuse. A face so evil. I'm comming undone. The mirror says it all. Eclipse and story. Of innocence lost. Empty eyes accuse. A face so evil. I'm comming undone. I said look at me my real angel. Abyss, I know, I will speak against you. Fly forgive me. My one I see, never say you know. Never for me, though it was for you. Fly me monster. Such an awful memory. (will I ever be able to sleep again?). My angel lie to me. And tell me I'm dreaming. (please wake me up, please wake me). A feel like you will always be. Such a tragic part of me. (I'll watch to see you torture me). Sweet, raffish. It will be. Mine. It will be. Done. (a mirror never lies. They know, everybody knows. Do you not see what they see?. A mirror never lies. I see what they see. Everybody knows, everybody knows)"

"oh, how the mighty have fallen","I'm having trouble breathing. And if I don't think fast. I'm likely to find myself here for good. Panic sets in as I start to question.

When did my heartbeat start to echo?. Why are my thoughts now fading, drifting, yea!. Twisting, yea! Tearing, yea! Bleeding, yea!. Excuse me, are you a maniac?. I am and I'm okay with that. My moon, my stars. One last night, one final kiss. Desire begging me not to go. Goodbye my everything. I'm terrified, I pull you near. Making sure that you are real. Open my eyes, it was all a dream. Goodbye my everything. An endless maze, a mobi√ºs labyrinth. Exodus, redemption, where have you gone!. And yet your gaze will not cease to burn into me!. So far removed, so mockingly you observe. Pariah, hypocrite! I will be free!. And yet you will remain. Excuse me, are you a maniac?. I am and I'm okay with that. My moon, my stars. One last night, one final kiss. Desire begging me not to go. Goodbye my everything. I'm terrified, I pull you near. Making sure that you are real. Open my eyes, it was all a dream. Goodbye my everything, goodbye my everything. No!. Futile screams go unheard. Incarcerated by so many walls. No!. Imprisoned and banished. Within a nexus of my own design. Don't go back, don't leave me. Hide from the world, let's not exist. Please God kill me!. Time is mocking me. And now I'm fighting gravity, yea. I'm destroying me. Colliding worlds will set you free. A straight line is not the shortest. Distance between two points!. I know that now! But I'm afraid it might be too late!. Will we come back from this?. Hold my hand, I'm blind!. Show me how, I'm lost!. My God it's beautiful. The portal opens, time is slowing, no turning back now, 'bel. My moon, my stars. One last night, one final kiss. Desire begging me not to go. Goodbye my everything. I'm terrified, I pull you near. Making sure that you are real. Open my eyes, it was all a dream. Goodbye my everything, goodbye my everything. No!. Futile screams go unheard. Incarcerated by so many walls. No!"

Gods turned his back on you, heavens gates are shut. And now you're knocking on the devils door!. I've been expecting you for some time, sir. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the one who pulls on all the strings, son. You're lucky I don't kill you where you stand. Tonight I raise my glass for I know it's time to move on. (This can't be real. There's nothing left.).

beautiful in blue,"Silence screams, ""you're just so beautiful in blue"". Breathless stares escape your undying eyes. Are you blind to my sorrow and sympathy?. A piece of me will die with your last breath.... This will all be over soon for you are so lost inside. Glazed eyes long for the waves' embrace. Drawn to an end so near.... Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice. Why are you trying to run away?. My love, i can't find the words to tell you.... Drown all of your fantasies with your final broken promise. Silent angel crashes through sky, having lost sight of the stars. Regail me with your tales of lonely, bittersweet loss. Giving up comes to easy when hope is gone. I'll walk away so you can choke on your dying breath. But if you side against me, to hell with you.... Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice. Why are you trying to run away?. My love, i can't find the words to tell you.... The fear has stolen her heart as she wakes from her dream. Treacherous ink finds her lungs, seizing her screams. Numb hands now reach too late to take back the light. Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice. Why are you trying to run away?. My love, i can't find the words to tell you.... Far away are days when you smiled.... Seas cry out butchering this tragic soul without hope. Their frailty is broken and now fades into the blue..."
deja vu all over again,"Let's raise our glass to rock and roll. May we live fast and you die old!. Every time I blink my eyes. I hardly realize how many things I've seen. I start remembering where I've been, where I'm going. The world goes racing by, my limit is the sky. Once a face in the crowd now I am facing the crowd. We are the music makers, the dreamers of dreams. Raise your glass!. Sing along to every single song. And dance around like you can almost taste the beat. Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night. And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip. When you're down I pick you up. One drink should be enough. Brothers through everything and always remembering. Where we've been and where we're going. Remember all that fear? The late nights and the tears?. Trying to do what's right while never forgetting why?. Long drives home in the sun-drenched thoughts of that first kiss. Raise your glass!. Sing along to every single song. And dance around like you can almost taste the beat. Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night. And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip. Sing along and if you're feeling reckless. Jump around like you can almost taste the beat. Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night. And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip. Give yourself to music, let it control you. Give yourself to music and it will set you free. Here's to the bold. Let's raise our glass to rock and roll. May we live fast and you die slow!. A way of life that you will never understand. My heart it lives here but my home is on the road. Over and over and over again. You dream therefore I am. Raise your glass!. Sing along to every single song. And dance around like you can almost taste the beat. Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night. And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip. Sing along and if you're feeling reckless. Jump around like you can almost taste the beat. Now shut your eyes tight and lose yourself in the night. And when the sweat drips we will make your heart skip. Give yourself to music, let it control you. Give yourself to music and it will set you free. Raise you're glass!"
ambrosia,"Ambrosia (brand new!!). A touch of poison seals my fate. The dawn echoes the night with my glory.... The sun himself honors me. Once king of roses, now lord of gold. The gods themselves envy my hand. Blessed with the gift of gilded touch. Fate wields its knife to cut the thread. I curse the day my dream became my descent. Suddenly I long for you, my only love. In my perfection I have no want. Yet eyes still glint with greed untold. A folly as fatal as sin has now become the end of me. I curse the day my dream became my descent. Suddenly I long for you. My only love. My only love. Have I not earned this, the gift of beauty within?. How selfish were the gods to keep their riches from my rightful treasure?. I truly have become one of them...My fatal flaw. Oh yeah! Ive got her hook, line, and sinker!. Thanks to me, shes her own new necklace!. Now shes good as gold!.

to be scared by an owl,"Look at the sky as the night descends. The rain is crashing down, I've hit another dead end. Just before I let hope slip away. A shadow is revealed, the devil shows his face.

I need you by my side, we can end this together. I know I promised you the world and still I let you down. I need you by my side and together we?ll end this now. Look in my eyes! Am I shaking now?. I am all you fear, have I made myself clear?. Shut your mouth and finish what you've started. Boy, you haven't got the slightest idea. Just who I am and what I do for you. don't you see that I am trying to save you?. Shut your mouth and finish what you've started. I'm scared to death and have myself to blame, no one else.

I know I promised you the world and still I let you down. I need you by my side and together we?ll end this now. As the last rays of sunlight fade, one killer chases another. Through the tangled madness of the city. A flash of steel announces the presence of his quarry. The stage is set, the night explodes.... You killed her you murderer. You have stripped me of the one that I love. Annabel, our Annabel. You have no clue what she's capable of.... I'm scared to death and have myself to blame. How did we end up fighting anyway?. You know, I used to search the sky and dream of where you were. I need you by my side, we can end this together. I know I promised you the world and still I let you down.

I have to believe that I might escape this hell. I fear I've lost myself and I don't know the way back. the way back to what I once was. Am I Fatima? Am I Rusalka?. Or am I just me?

Does she know before I met her I had only dreamt of so much blood?. So why is she tempting me?
a siren's soliloquy,"paralyzed by the beauty of those words. that so delicately drip from this angel of untamed lust. suddenly I fear the end of my solitude. once a warrior, poetic shrieks now own my soul. left behind to fight the ruthless pawns of Eris. hope will strike her down beneath the blade as she sings for him. suffering unseen now will be left to burn in her stare. but he no longer fights the torture of her voice. so long forgotten, I am lost in her stare. mad so clear as she extracts her painful toll. a soul now echoes with the torture of the sirens. ...he is hers.... beautiful whispers leave one so far. chain these hands of ageless struggle. rid us of this beloved curse. an epic tale of deceit is given life once more on silver lips so spiteful. her tongue screams for him. rid us of this curse. suffering unseen now will be left to burn in her stare. but he no longer fights the torture of her voice. so long forgotten, I am lost in her stare. mad so clear as she extracts her painful toll. a soul now echoes with the torture of the sirens. he is hers.. set loose so long ago by the foolish whim of Pandora. phantoms which shall forever prey on mankind's weakness. the grains of time hold no bearing to those eyes. in pale moonlight she sings to the haunted sea. vile notes seduce old Cerberus to slake unholy thirst. left behind to fight the ruthless pawns of Eris. hope will strike her down beneath the blade as she sings for him. suffering unseen now will be left to burn in her stare. but he no longer fights the torture of her voice. so long forgotten, I am lost in her stare. mad so clear as she extracts her painful toll. a soul now echoes with the torture of the sirens. he is hers."
adagio for catastrophe,"Love the illusion, adore the deception. Hold on to the one who's destroying you. The light shines, I walk in. Unafraid to meet you on the other side. Give yourself to me, all to me. I welcome the ending of a story never meant to satisfy. Give yourself to me, all to me. As I welcome the doubt and horror of this elegy. I black out. Oh, here we go again. The light shines, I walk in. Unafraid to meet you on the other side. Give yourself to me, all to me. I welcome the ending of a story never meant to satisfy. Give yourself to me, all to me. I wait for the darkness to appear. And greet me as the night arrives. Another sick nightmare. So begins the torture of feeling alive"
alchemy sounded good at the time,"my darling queen, I lay myself at your feet. and I shall stay the hands of fate. wind cries out, heavens boil above voicing discontent to my sins. I have found the way to trick the ferryman. I have deceived the ancient Gods. cold flesh lends to me its secrets for a price too high. I shudder at what I have done. each day brings me closer to you, my tragic victory. darling queen I lay at your feet.... chills take me as she wakes, throat gasps tainted breath. I've reclaimed you my stolen bride. can your soul forgive my crimes of passion?. I would not close the casket; I'm so consumed by your pain. faint screams echo through the night.... cold flesh lends to me its secrets for a price too high. I shudder at what I have done. each day brings me closer to you, my tragic victory. the pains of death can no longer haunt you. as the dawning sky brings forth one forsaken thought. death can not win for I now dwell in the palace of decay. and I shall stay the hands of fate. night descends, sinews twitch. my pale queen finally stands to taste silent lips now cursed with her love. cold flesh lends to me its secrets for a price too high. I shudder at what I have done. each day brings me closer to you, my tragic victory"

almost famous,"These eyes they have seen the world. These feet they have walked a thousand miles. My lungs have screamed countless melodies. How do I find the words, the motivation?. I know I could have it all but there's a price so high. A drop of blood is all it takes. Do you feel your fingertips losing their grip?. Will they be there when you start to fall?. I will never let go, let go of the night. The night we decided we could have it all. Chasing a meaningless ending. Without a good reason I'm just second guessing. Because I'm honestly fine beneath the wool. Take the road less traveled. Wait to see where it will lead. Maybe I'm just afraid. Maybe I am okay. Tell me are you second guessing?. Because you honestly seem to have it all. Are you under control or questioning how this all ends?. I could have it all but there's a price too high. A drop of blood is all it takes. Do you feel your fingertips losing their grip?. Will they be there when you start to fall?. I will never let go, let go of the night. The night we decided we could have it all. Stand and fight, swine!. Are you man enough to confess your lies?. Shaking the devil's hand, never missing a beat. You are a snake amidst the jewels of thieves. You crawl slithering cowardly fueled by empty respect. Your soul reeks of addiction. What's the price? Where's the line?. Sacrificing my honor just to be what you are?. I would rather be put to death. Do you feel your fingertips losing their grip?. Will they be there when you start to fall?. I will never let go, let go of the night. The night we decided we could have it all. I'll never be you"
ambrosia,"Ambrosia (brand new!!). A touch of poison seals my fate. The dawn echoes the night with my glory.... The sun himself honors me. Once king of roses, now lord of gold. The gods themselves envy my hand. Blessed with the gift of gilded touch. Fate wields its knife to cut the thread. I curse the day my dream became my descent. Suddenly I long for you, my only love. In my perfection I have no want. Yet eyes still glint with greed untold. A folly as fatal as sin has now become the end of me. I curse the day my dream became my descent. Suddenly I long for you. My only love. My only love. Have I not earned this, the gift of beauty within?. How selfish were the gods to keep their riches from my rightful treasure?. I truly have become one of them...My fatal flaw. Oh yeah! Ive got her hook, line, and sinker!. Thanks to me, shes her own new necklace!. Now shes good as gold!. I curse the day my dream became my descent. Suddenly I long for you. My only love. ...Cut the thread..."

and now for the final illusion,"My eyes open wide as I wake, panting, some say that dreams have deeper meaning.. That they are cries from our subconscious.. I feel strangely compelled to recount this one to my love,. My Annabel, shaking her gently, I wonder why her flesh has the chill of virgin snow.. My thoughts are disrupted as reality hits me like a bold of lightning and I scream.. We are the crucified, we are the virtuous, we are the damned.. We are the crucified, this is our nightmare, let's pray we never fall asleep.. Imprisoned beneath the world where the soulless dwell.. Lies a place that the damned call home.. A place where the virtuous hide in fear.. A place we see only in our nightmares.. A place where the sun is silent.. @death_slytherin"

beautiful in blue,"Silence screams, ""you're just so beautiful in blue"". Breathless stares escape your undying eyes. Are you blind to my sorrow and sympathy?. A piece of me will die with your last breath.... This will all be over soon for you are so lost inside. Glazed eyes long for the waves' embrace. Drawn to an end so near.... Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice. Why are you trying to run away?. My love, i can't find the words to tell you.... Drown all of your fantasies with your final broken promise. Silent angel crashes through sky, having lost sight of the stars. Regail me with your tales of lonely, bittersweet loss. Giving up comes to easy when hope is gone. I'll walk away so you can choke on your dying breath. But if you side against me, to hell with you.... Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice. Why are you trying to run away?. My love, i can't find the words to tell you.... The fear has stolen her heart as she wakes from her dream. Treacherous ink finds her lungs, seizing her screams. Numb hands now reach too late to take back the light. Far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice. Why are you trying to run away?. My love, i can't find the words to tell you.... Far away are days when you smiled.... Seas cry out butchering this tragic soul without hope. Their frailty is broken and now fades into the blue..."

Trying not to think about it trying not to think about it. It's here!. Foregrounds burst to nothing. As symmetry explodes. The artist screams and beauty dies, his canvas rends. While his easel burns. He's lost everything in but one cruel instant existence swept away. Did man even notice as he was erased?"
"ciao, bella","The sun was pouring through. The window as annabel slept. Before she opened her eyes, already dead. The house was so quiet. Its possible she was alone. A solitude only she could know. If there's a chance. That she's alive then cut me open. I need to see, I need to breathe. Another day in this place and I'll be broken. I'm getting closer each and every time. An unsettling feeling in my stomach. Began to rise. And distracted me from reverie. The whole thing had felt like a dream. I opened the letter, inside was one word. Run. You're going to have to do. A lot better than that, sweetheart. All that is left to do now. Is to get the hell out of here. But first I have to find the book. The journal. The one with the words. The emptiness scrawled across the front. You want me?. Come and get me. A mirror in disguise tears me in three. You have no choice but to run. Come and get me. A mirror filled with lies punishes me. I have no choice but to run. Come and find me. The moon was pouring through. The window as she found the rose. Suddenly before my eyes annabel spoke. She said, oh, my love take my hand. These are eyes you can trust. The only thing is it was not her at all. Stay away from this place. You do not belong here. No matter what anyone tells you. No matter what you may think you see. Stay away from this place. The emptiness will haunt you. You want me?. Come and get me. Wake up. Believe in the unbelievable. Until we meet again. Ciao, bella"

Oh the horror! Oh the panic!. Paranoid and deranged! I am a God!. Psychotic and ashamed! Why! Why!. Can you hear me? Can you see me?. Can I hold you closer and drown in your dreams?. I promise fantasies can be more. Than words that we have buried alive. The nightmare is real still I pray and beg for more. I'm never closing my eyes. Forever one with the night. I'm never closing my eyes. Forever one with the night. It was a dark and stormy night. I've traveled near and far, raced with all the stars. Now alone I'll be, subtle tragedy. If I had one more chance to just explore. I would take your hand and do it all again"
"congratulations, i hate you",No one ever said that life was fair and I'm not saying that it should be. So knowing that you are where you want to be and I'm not comes as no surprise. But don't expect me to be happy for you. And don't smile at me and tell me things will work out for me too. I don't want your pity...I hate your pity. Taste your vanity.... Its sweet bitterness as you hide behind your veil of my stolen hopes and lost dreams. You took them all.... I watched you steal my thoughts and had to see you smile. As you build your dreams on my shattered hopes. I'll look back on a day once loved and fantasize for tragedy. Beg me to make this easier and listen to my hopeless cries. Suffer alone in emptiness. I lust to see you swallowed by the mess that you left in your wake. Disgust lies deep within your empty gaze.... Beg me to make this easier and listen as my hopeless cries. Send stares into your meaningless eyes. My envy can't describe how I loathe you for having all the stars. Leaving my eyes to marvel the sky knowing it should be mine. Yet it's you I see wasting the dream that only I deserve. I'll tear off your face to see your smile. As you build your dreams on my shattered hopes. I'll look back on a day once loved and fantasize for tragedy. . ... C√°ssio Bouvier =]
curse of the virgin canvas,"I am here to tell you a story. A story that will torture your thoughts by day and. poison your dreams by night. And though I will do my best,. There are no words that can be written. Nor brush strokes laid on canvas that can describe. This dark and utter horror of the night that annabel died. The emptiness will haunt you. This is a nightmare. Is my annabel really gone?. Why have I stopped my day oh,. I find it hard to breathe. Her body teases me. As the sun reveals the dawn. Her smile reflects the gold. I kissed a sharp painful lie. Baby lay in my arms. And cuddle me close. Soon this will be. Just an awful memory. (will I ever be able to sleep again?). My angel lie to me. And tell me I'm dreaming. (please wake me up, please wake me). A feel like you will always be. Such a tradgic part of me. (I'll watch to see you torture me). I watch the blood drip. From the corners of your mouth. The watch seems vicious for me. I'll frown and slit your throat. I'm starting to believe. What my eyes are seeing now. Eyes look so beautiful. And you know what I'll be now. Baby lay in my arms.

fatima rusalka,"Born out of nothingness, defined by beauty and patience. A tortured existence which leaves behind no answers. Destined to suffer the struggle, cursed to be one of them, to be both of them. Fatima. Rusalka. Somewhere between the chaos and the void in a desert that predates time itself, bereft of stars and untouched by the Gods of man. There was only one. There was only her. Black echoes deafening silence. Spat upon the tortured earth. She is born all alone. Cursed to never live, cursed to never die. Scarlet fiend condemned to breathe eternally. Thirsting for an answer, starving for her purpose. But the sky holds his tongue as she waits for the end. And it's not looking good at all. An anguished melody reveals to me a memory of love once lost. A quiet affliction, a moment of weakness. Breathe and shut your eyes. Finally, it all makes sense so naturally I am lost. When angels and devils make sense of the wreckage. Unsung heroine, death won't set you free. Cautiously I softly fake a smile, its cold here at night. I'm trying to hide, dying to find myself. I should stop praying to no one. I can't stop searching for someone. Please just stop, sweetheart, it gets better than this. I wish I could go, wish I could find a way. I just want to see your face. But now I'm starting to see how it all ends. And it's not looking good at all. An anguished melody reveals to me a memory of love once lost. A quiet affliction, a moment of weakness. Breathe and shut your eyes. Finally, it all makes sense so naturally I am lost. When angels and devils make sense of the wreckage. Unsung heroine, death won't set you free. Immortality is your curse, an orphan by God, and lost. You're an orphan by God, and lost. An orphan by God. So now it seems the sky has failed me. This has been a terrible mistake. If I had just one more chance. If you're looking for an answer. Hold tight and never let me go. And the lies we said we'll bury with the rest. Oh, the senselessness of all this suffering. Feel it again and over again. Let it begin. Ageless warrior left to destroy mankind and reap the earth. We have to believe, trust that there is hope. Useless prayers will be left to unveil the truth that all is lost. We have to believe, trust that there is hope. It was never just a dream"

the coward,"I found him lying there on the floor. He did not breathe. Looked around but to my chagrin. I was surrounded. By a scene of morbid despair, suffering souls. And I waited for the knife to find me. But luckily I was alone. Escape, pretend you were never here!. I run, make sure there's no-one around, don't make a sound. I beg my body to stay off of the ground. Oh, do you realize just what you've done?. Oh, I knew. Will I ever mention her name?. I am a coward but I'm alive. I am so sorry I'm still alive. So I go back, I taste the horror I stare blankly. Don't know where to begin. The smell consumes me. One by one I cover them all, say my goodbyes. Then I slowly find my way into the night. Only this time I'm not alone. You had your chance but it's over now!"

the goddess,"My breath is slowly catching up to my mind after the crash. Inhale, exhale. Now open your eyes, see the wonder. I'm telling you its unbelievable. Did I lose myself? Am I still alive?. Something isn't right. Am I just asleep or is this really happening to me?. Tell myself I'm fine. Get up on your feet, get up on your feet. Answer me now!. I never wanna leave because you feel like ecstasy. A seduction becoming a part of me. Damn you! Temptation, you've got a hold on me. Stand up, walk away, don't fall into the trap.

You just have to believe in the unbelievable. My shadow hides in a place where the sun screams. Come back, my tears. Please just tell me what you are!. Why can't I feel?. I can't stay here I will never be anything. But a fraud too scared to lose it all!. I won't let you go. I don't wanna leave because you are ecstasy. I never wanna leave because you feel like ecstasy. A seduction becoming a part of me. Damn you! Temptation, you've got a hold on me. Stand up, walk away, don't fall into the trap. I don't wanna leave because you are ecstasy"

Hang angels, burn children. Oh, I'd drink oceans, eat the moon. Flood the world, end everything. Breathe in, breathe out. We could run far away but then how would we sleep at night?.

I must say a sunny day helps to push the memories away. Walk along the shore of an ocean of rage... Gazing in amazement at each screaming wave. Everywhere I look there‚Äôs agony and pain... What‚Äôs the point of fighting when there‚Äôs nothing to save?. Time is melting away, I can‚Äôt explain but my eyes are begging to stay. I must say a sunny day helps to push the memories away. Caution must be obeyed on an island of decayed... @death_slytherin"
welcome to the vanity faire,"I search high and low but I can?t find you. Still your vexing laugh entices me. Close enough to touch but then you run away. I?m about to quit and then you say, ?lose yourself in the vanity faire!?. Insanity is whispering to me, woah!. What I believe is just not making sense of what I see. Show me your reflection, a sly disguise, is it the girl you want to be?. A porcelain smile, you?re a knockout, baby?. Drape yourself in fragile fantasy. I see your reflection, a sly disguise, and it?s not the girl your want to be?. A fraudulent smile. What you see is what you?ve asked for,but it?s never what you are. A cold-hearted tale. Lost in a maze of beautiful deception. And just like before I?m at the mercy of a phantom. When will it end? How will it end? And will you be in arms?. I just can?t take anymore of this pointless search for nothing. Insanity is whispering to me woah!. What I believe is just not making sense of what I see. Show me your reflection, a sly disguise, is it the girl you want to be?. A fraudulent smile. What you see is what you?ve asked for,but it?s never what you are. Hey hey hey!. Silence, oh cruel harlot!. Silence! Your filthy tongue will be stilled!. Laughter echoing, I?m unraveling tonight. Silence! I?ve had enough!. Silence! No longer will you stop me!. Your vanity so patiently will steal your soul. You?re hideous... Mirror, mirror on the wall, a liar to us all, you?ll be the one to fall. The eye of the beholder knows the truth. Show me your reflection, a sly disguise,Is it the girl you want to be?. A porcelain smile, you?re a knockout, baby!. Drape yourself in fragile fantasy. I see you reflection, a sly disguise,And it?s not the girl you want to be?. A fraudulent smile. What you see is what you?ve asked for,but it?s never what you are. What you see is what you?ve asked for,What you see is what you get. A cold-hearted tale. Attack the mirrors, shatter the prison. One by one reflections fall, come on come on come on come on!. Until I destroy them all, come on come on come on come on!. . death slytherin"
what goes around,"Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?. You know I gave you the world. You had me in the palm of your hand. So why your love went away. I just can't seem to understand. Thought it was me and you babe. Me and you until the end. But I guess I was wrong. Don't want to talk about it. Don't want to think about it. I'm just so sick about it. Can't believe it's ending this way. Just so confused about it. Feeling the blues about it. I just can't do without ya. Tell me is this fair?. Is this the way it's really going down?. Is this how we say goodbye?. Should've known better when you came around. That you were gonna make me cry. It's breaking my heart to watch you run around. 'Cause I know that you're living a lie. That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find.... What goes around, goes around, goes around. Comes all the way back around. What goes around, goes around, goes around. Comes all the way back around. Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed. You said that you were moving on now. And maybe I should do the same. Funny thing about that is. I was ready to give you my name. Thought it was me and you, babe. And now, it's all just a shame. And I guess I was wrong. Don't want to talk about it. Don't want to think about it. I'm just so sick about it. Can't believe it's ending this way. Just so confused about it. Feeling the blues about it. I just can't do without ya. Can you tell me is this fair?. Is this the way it's really going down?. Is this how we say goodbye?. Should've known better when you came around. That you were going to make me cry. Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around. 'Cause I know that you're living a lie. That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find. What goes around, goes around, goes around. Comes all the way back around. What goes around, goes around, goes around. Comes all the way back around. And now you want somebody. To cure the lonely nights. You wish you had somebody. That could come and make it right. But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy. You'll see. (What goes around comes back around). (What goes around comes back around). (What goes around comes back around). (What goes around comes back around). You spend your nights alone. And he never comes home. And every time you call him. All you get's a busy tone. I heard you found out. That he's doing to you. What you did to me. Ain't that the way it goes. When you cheated girl. My heart bleeded girl. So it goes without saying that you left me feeling. hurt. Just a classic case. A scenario. Tale as old as time. Girl you got what you deserved. I thought I told you, baby. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told you, baby. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told you, baby. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told you, baby"
