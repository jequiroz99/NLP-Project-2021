high horse,"I don't condone you. Sittin' on your throne. Talking with that tone. You think that you're some big shot. I don't approve. The way you like to move. In front of everyone. Just 'cuz you've got a bigger gun. I'm not impressed. By the way you dress. Nor your entourage, I know. It's all a trained mirage. You hold the jack of spades. You calculate your trades. You stack your house with maids. And I'm just a joker. (never was too good at poker). Get off your high horse. Before I knock you down. Get off your high horse. Can't you hear that sound. It's all around. I don't esteem. To be part of your scheme. Nor a player on your team. 'Cuz there's a bigger dream. I won't succumb. To your puppet master thumb. Pushin' me around. No, I stand on solid ground. Get off your high horse. Before I knock you down. Bring you to the ground. Get off your high horse. Can't you hear that sound. [instrumental]. Get off Get off Get off your high horse. Get off Get off Get off your high horse. Get off Get off Get off your high horse. Get off your high horse. You're no rightful heir to crown"
