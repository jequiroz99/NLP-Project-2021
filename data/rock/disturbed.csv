the sound of silence,"Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping. Left its seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain. Still remains within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone. Narrow streets of cobblestone. 'Neath the halo of a street lamp. I turned my collar to the cold and damp. When my eyes were stabbed. By the flash of a neon light. That split the night. And touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light I saw. Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking. People hearing without listening. People writing songs. That voices never share. And no one dare. Disturb the sound of silence. ""Fools"" said I, ""you do not know. Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you. Take my arms that I might reach you"". But my words like silent raindrops fell. And echoed in the wells of silence. And the people bowed and prayed. To the neon God they made. And the sign flashed out its warning. And the words that it was forming. And the sign said. ""The words of the prophets. Are written on the subway walls. And tenement halls"". And whispered in the sound of silence"
a reason to fight,"The image in your eyes. Reflecting the pain that has taken you. I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame. From what's ailing you. I won't give up, so don't give in. You've fallen down, but you can rise again. So don't give up. When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin. And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win. When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin. When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight. Lost in your world of lies. I find it so hard to believe in you. Can it be real this time?. Or just a part of this game that we're playing through. I won't give up, so don't give in. You've fallen down, but you will rise again. I won't give up. When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin. And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win. When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin. When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight. Don't let it take your soul. Look at me, take control. When knowing to fight this war. This is nothing worth dying for. Are you ready to begin?. This is a battle that we are gonna win. When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin. When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason. When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin. And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win. When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin. When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight. I'll be your reason to fight. Give you a reason to fight"

the light,"Like an unsung melody. The truth is waiting there for you to find it. It's not a blight but a remedy. A clear reminder of how it began. Deep inside your memory. You turned away as you struggled to find it. You heard their call as you walked away. A voice of calm but within the silence. And though it seemed an eternity. You waited, hoping it would call out again. With the shadow beckoning. Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded. You held your guard as you walked away. When you think all is forsaken. Listen to me now (all's not forsaken). You need never feel broken again. Sometimes darkness. Can show you the light. An unforgivable tragedy. The answer isn't where you think you'd find it. Prepare yourself for a reckoning. From when your world seems to crumble again. Don't be afraid, don't turn away. You're the one who can redefine it. Don't let hope become a memory. Let the shadow permeate your mind, then. Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away. So that the door can be opened again. Within your darkest memories. Lies the answer if you dare to find it. Don't let hope become a memory. When you think all is forsaken. Listen to me now (all's not forsaken). You need never feel broken again. Sometimes darkness. Can show you the light. Sickening, weakening. Don't let another zombie pariah consume your soul. You need strengthening, toughening. It takes a bit of dark to rekindle the fire burning in you. Ignite the fire within you. When you think all is forsaken. Listen to me now (all's not forsaken). You need never feel broken again. Sometimes darkness. Can show you the light. Don't ignore. Listen to me now. You need never feel broken again. Sometimes darkness. Can show you the light"

the night,"What has come over me. What madness taken hold of my heart. To run away, the only answer. Pulling me away. To fall upon the night. The source of my recovery. Sweet shadow taking hold of the light. Another day has been devoured. Calling me away, begging the question. Why. For saving me from all they've taken. Letting my armor fall again. Giving me the strength to face them. Feeling it taking over now. On a path to take it all away. There can be no better way of knowing. [Chorus]. In a world beyond controlling. Are you going to deny the savior. In front of your eyes. Stare into the night. Power beyond containing. Are you going to remain a slave for. The rest of your life. Give into the night. This self discovery. Redemption taking hold of my mind. A serenade of haunting voices. Calling me away. To feast upon the night. The source of my Felicity. Dark maiden taking hold of my hand. Lead me away from hibernation. Strong and unafraid. Never a question why. For saving me from all they've taken. Letting my armor fall again. Giving me the strength to face them. Feeling it taking over now. I'm about to take it away. There can be no better way of knowing. [Chorus]. In a world beyond controlling. Are you going to deny the savior. In front of your eyes. Stare into the night. Power beyond containing. Are you going to remain a slave for. The rest of your life. Give into the night. [Guitar Solo]. Give in to the night. [Chorus].

asylum,"Release me. No remnants were ever found of it. Feeling the hot bile. With every fake smile. Though no evidence was ever found. It never went away completely. I tried hide from the unholy sound of it. Another day gone, another night's dawn. Dark forces pull me underground. They never went away completely. How can I feel this empty?. I will not recover this time. This loneliness is killing me. Will I ever know peace of mind again?. I don't believe it, I can't achieve it. I think it all is just another sign. It never went away completely. Terror is coursing in me. (Terror inside of me - keeps a diligent watch on eveything...). Dreading the final moment when I have to dream.

To let go. Now it's dragging me into your grave. Your asylum, forget the lie. Overcome by the feeling that. I won't get to join you in time. And the loneliness is killing me. Death's images are all around again. They're right behind me. They're gonna find me. Judgment from the immortal sin. That had enveloped me completely. I know I'll never know a peaceful night again. Afraid they'll hear me, they don't fear me. Punishment from the immoral crime. The debt was never paid completely. Terror is coursing in me.

In the end you will find out everything (not anything). In the end you may question your belief (what belief?). In the end you will realize finally how you were deceived. This has gone on too long, no more demonic dreams. Destroyer come tonight because the memory is killing me. In asylum, I live a lie. I let go now it's dragging me into your grave. For asylum, relive the lie. Overcome by the feeling that. I won't get to join you in time (not a chance). This world is not fulfilling me. Don't need to live an asylum, I live a lie.

3,"I often wonder why I sit and wait to die. What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?. Too many hours spent in darkness questioning. ""How and why""?. I can't remember many moments in the light. This retribution has defiled me to no end. An execution without merit looms ahead. Tell me why?. I was a boy who had to live his own way. I never fit into the model they had designed. I chose a path less taken. I stood with others who had often felt the same. We got stares from passersby. Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away. And when three young boys died. They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!. No hope in sight. I sit here terrified! (Terrified!, Terrified!). Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? (Bring it to light!, Bring it to light!). Won't anybody open up their eyes? (Open your eyes!, Open your eyes!). Before the three of us have lost our lives!. Why was everybody so damn afraid?. They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime. And to justify their own faith. We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time. The three of us were attacked and disgraced. For many hours we were questioned and someone lied. One of us couldn't take it. His simple manner was manipulated in time. Fear made him lie. Now I sit here terrified! (Terrified!, Terrified!). Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? (Bring it to light!, Bring it to light!). Won't anybody open up their eyes? (Open your eyes!, Open your eyes!). Before the three of us have lost our lives!. Now I am terrified! (Terrified!, Terrified!, Terrified!). Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? (Bring it to light!, Bring it to light!). Won't anybody open up their eyes? (Open your eyes!, Open your eyes!). Before the three of us have lose our lives!. And why? (Tell me why!, Tell me why). Can't anybody see through their disguise? (Through their disguise!, Through their disguise). Believe we didn't take their lives! (Taken their lives!, Taken their lives!). And now the three of us have lost our lives. I often wonder why I sit and wait to die. What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?. Too many hours spent in darkness questioning. ""How and why""?. I can't remember many moments in the light. This retribution has defiled me to no end. And execution without merit looms ahead. Tell me why?"
a reason to fight,"The image in your eyes. Reflecting the pain that has taken you. I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame. From what's ailing you. I won't give up, so don't give in. You've fallen down, but you can rise again. So don't give up. When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin. And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win. When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin. When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight. Lost in your world of lies. I find it so hard to believe in you. Can it be real this time?. Or just a part of this game that we're playing through. I won't give up, so don't give in. You've fallen down, but you will rise again. I won't give up. When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin. And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win. When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin. When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight. Don't let it take your soul. Look at me, take control. When knowing to fight this war. This is nothing worth dying for. Are you ready to begin?. This is a battle that we are gonna win. When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin. When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason. When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin. And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win. When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin. When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight. I'll be your reason to fight. Give you a reason to fight"

I'm crucified,. Cold and unwhole again,. Crying out and questioning,. Will I ever love again?. What's the point of anything?. It takes a toll again,. This is where the fun begins,. Visions haunt me through the night,. Now I'm dying for your sins,. I can't believe that,. If you look me in the face,. You can say there's nothing left,. How the silence drives me insane,. I will focus all my pain,. Right into your heart,. Till it makes you blind,. Till the faces of your former world,. Have fallen from your sight,. Till you're mine,.

Emptiness is filling me. To the point of agony. Growing darkness taking dawn. I was me, but now he is gone"

fire it up,"When I need to spark a bit of inspiration. and the melody feels like it's trapped inside. all I need is a bit of illumination. so the rhythm can no longer run and hide.

I feel like serenity. I feel like serenity... is mine. When I need a little bit of relaxation. my medicine isn't too hard to find. When I'm looking for a bit rejuvenation. I only partake of the finest kind. And then the mystery begins to unravel. and it helps me break through to the other side. Fire it up, I like to fire it up. and it feels so right. Fire it up, 'cause when I fire it up. I feel like serenity. I feel like serenity... is mine. Fire it up, fire it up. Fire it up. Fire it up, I like to fire it up. and it feels so right.

forsaken,"*lyrics actually performed by David Draimon. I'm over it. You see I'm falling in the vast abyss. Clouded by memories of the past. At last, I see. I hear it fading. I can't speak it. or else you will dig my grave. We fear them finding. Always winding. Take my hand now. Be alive. You see I cannot be forsaken. Because I'm not the only one. We walk amongst you. Feeding, raping. Must we hide from everyone. I'm over it. Why can't we be together. Erase it. Sleeping so long. Taking off the mask. At last, I see. I hear it fading. I can't speak it. or else you will dig my grave. We fear them finding. Always winding. Take my hand now. Be alive. You see I cannot be forsaken. Because I'm not the only one. We walk amongst you. Feeding, raping. Must we hide from everyone. You see I cannot be forsaken. Because I'm not the only one. We walk amongst you. Feeding, raping. Must we hide from everyone. Everyone.

When I awake and discover that I have been damaged by your. World. Dishonored by your world. Your world. I'm haunted by your world. (Never will I be welcomed. Amongst the heartless monsters you surround yourself with. Feeding off the pain and misfortune of others. A maniacal unit of sub-human parasites. Warped into a feeding frenzy with the smell of fresh blood. Open your eyes and see the creatures for what they are. A swirling mess of hatred and envy. Don't be naive enough to think you're unaffected. The conversion has already begun...). You're frightened, so am I. A world of demons wait. Watching the movements and filling my heart with hate. You're burning, so will I. When I awake and discover how I have been ravaged by your. World. Dishonored by your world. Your world. I'm haunted by your world"

Another love that I've taken from you. Lost in time, on the edge of suffering. Another taste of the evil I breed. Will level you completely. Bring to life everything that you fear. Live in the dark, and the world is threatening. Let me enlighten you. This is the way I pray. Living just isn't hard enough. Burn me alive, inside. Living my life's not hard enough. Take everything away. Return to me x3. Turn to me. Leave me no one. Turn to me. Return to me x2. Turn to me. Cast aside. Return to me x3. Turn to me. Leave me no one. Return to me x3.

I can barely control this feeling. Look at the murder in my eyes. I was never good at concealing. Violent thoughts have come to life. Horror will have a deeper meaning. You are the reason this began. Even now I can hear you screaming. There's only one thing left to destroy. And I'll no longer be paranoid. No more reason to be annoyed. In a moment you will see my other side. When I'm confronted.

the animal,Now!. I can feel the animal inside. My resolve is weakening. Pounding on the doors of my mind. It's nearly overpowering. I cannot begin to describe. The hunger that I feel again. Run if you intend to survive. For the beast is coming to life. Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight. Death approaches on this night. For the animal's soul is mine. We will be completed right before your eyes. I have no control this time. And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight. I can feel the calling again. The primal need is filling me. Changes are about to begin. And now my blood is boiling. I can see the fear in your eyes. But you can't bring yourself to scream. Time to shed the mortal disguise. For the beast is coming to life. Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight. Death approaches on this night. For the animal's soul is mine. We will be completed right before your eyes. I have no control this time. And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight. We begin the hunt tonight. Til the power courses the creatures take flight. When the kill is close and I will be satisfied. For the smell of fear tonight. Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied. You're mine. For the animal's soul is mine. We will be completed right before your eyes. I have no control this time. And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight. For the animal's soul is mine. And the world around will never hear your cries. An unholy crime. And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight.. .

All I wanted was to hide,and. Try to numb the ache inside. And I'm still afraid of the light. And a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise. (CHORUS). Now if I am to survive. The Infection must die. Murder the beast that's been eating me alive. The Infection must die. Nothing left but a broken man. Terrified of everything. Nothing left of his foolish pride,his. Fond memories slowly die,then. As he wakes again alone. Still a prisoner in his home. Ready to allow the dart to. Penetrate his broken heart. And I'm still afraid of the light. And a thousand voices share their laughter at his demise. (CHORUS). Now if I am to survive. The Infection must die. Murder the beast that's been eating me alive. The Infection must die. (SOLO).

the light,"Like an unsung melody. The truth is waiting there for you to find it. It's not a blight but a remedy. A clear reminder of how it began. Deep inside your memory. You turned away as you struggled to find it. You heard their call as you walked away. A voice of calm but within the silence. And though it seemed an eternity. You waited, hoping it would call out again. With the shadow beckoning. Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded. You held your guard as you walked away. When you think all is forsaken. Listen to me now (all's not forsaken). You need never feel broken again. Sometimes darkness. Can show you the light. An unforgivable tragedy. The answer isn't where you think you'd find it. Prepare yourself for a reckoning. From when your world seems to crumble again. Don't be afraid, don't turn away. You're the one who can redefine it. Don't let hope become a memory. Let the shadow permeate your mind, then. Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away. So that the door can be opened again. Within your darkest memories. Lies the answer if you dare to find it. Don't let hope become a memory. When you think all is forsaken. Listen to me now (all's not forsaken). You need never feel broken again. Sometimes darkness. Can show you the light. Sickening, weakening. Don't let another zombie pariah consume your soul. You need strengthening, toughening. It takes a bit of dark to rekindle the fire burning in you. Ignite the fire within you. When you think all is forsaken. Listen to me now (all's not forsaken). You need never feel broken again. Sometimes darkness. Can show you the light. Don't ignore. Listen to me now. You need never feel broken again. Sometimes darkness. Can show you the light"
the night,"What has come over me. What madness taken hold of my heart. To run away, the only answer. Pulling me away. To fall upon the night. The source of my recovery. Sweet shadow taking hold of the light. Another day has been devoured. Calling me away, begging the question. Why. For saving me from all they've taken. Letting my armor fall again. Giving me the strength to face them. Feeling it taking over now. On a path to take it all away. There can be no better way of knowing. [Chorus]. In a world beyond controlling. Are you going to deny the savior. In front of your eyes. Stare into the night. Power beyond containing. Are you going to remain a slave for. The rest of your life. Give into the night. This self discovery. Redemption taking hold of my mind. A serenade of haunting voices. Calling me away. To feast upon the night. The source of my Felicity. Dark maiden taking hold of my hand. Lead me away from hibernation. Strong and unafraid. Never a question why. For saving me from all they've taken. Letting my armor fall again. Giving me the strength to face them. Feeling it taking over now. I'm about to take it away. There can be no better way of knowing. [Chorus]. In a world beyond controlling. Are you going to deny the savior. In front of your eyes. Stare into the night. Power beyond containing. Are you going to remain a slave for. The rest of your life. Give into the night. [Guitar Solo]. Give in to the night. [Chorus]. In a world beyond controlling. Are you going to deny the savior. In front of your eyes. Stare into the night. Power beyond containing. Are you going to remain a slave for. The rest of your life.

the sound of silence,"Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping. Left its seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain. Still remains within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone. Narrow streets of cobblestone. 'Neath the halo of a street lamp. I turned my collar to the cold and damp. When my eyes were stabbed. By the flash of a neon light. That split the night. And touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light I saw. Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking. People hearing without listening. People writing songs. That voices never share. And no one dare. Disturb the sound of silence. ""Fools"" said I, ""you do not know. Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you. Take my arms that I might reach you"". But my words like silent raindrops fell. And echoed in the wells of silence. And the people bowed and prayed. To the neon God they made. And the sign flashed out its warning. And the words that it was forming. And the sign said. ""The words of the prophets. Are written on the subway walls. And tenement halls"". And whispered in the sound of silence"
the vengeful one,"He's assuming the chaos. taking in the lack of raw humanity. It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity.

For judgment falls upon you at first light. I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah. I'm the vengeful one. (Look inside and see what you're becoming). In the blackest moment, of a dying world. What have you become?. (Look inside and see what you're becoming). As the violent urges?. the teeming masses have been terrorized. The human predators all gone mad. are reaping profits born from their demise. The rabid media plays their role. stoking the flames of war to no surprise. Only too eager to sell their souls. for the apocalypse must be televised. So sleep soundly in your beds tonight. For judgment falls upon you at first light. I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah.

violence fetish,Bring the violence. It's significant. To the life. If you've ever known anyone. Bring the violence. It's significant. To the life. Can you feel it?. How do you sleep. When you live with your lies. Out of your mouth. Up from your mind. That kind of thinking. Starts a chain reaction. You are a time bomb ticking away. You need to release. What you're feeling inside. Let out the beast. That you're trying to hide. Step right up and be a part of the action. Get your game face on. Because it's time to play. You're pushing and fighting your way. You're ripping it up. How do you live without playing the game. Sit on the side and expect to keep sane. Step right up and be a part of the action. Come get a piece of it before it's too late. Take a look around. You can't deny what you see. Were living in a violent society. Well my brother let me show you a better way. Now get your game face on because it's time to play. You're pushing and fighting your way you're ripping it up. So tell me what am I supposed to be. Another gdamn drone. Tell me what am I supposed to be. Should I leave it on the inside. Should I get ready to play. You're pushing and fighting your way. You're ripping it up

watch you burn,"I didn't mean to give my soul away. To have the life I thought that everybody wants. And I need to let you know I was wrong. It's a sham. They stole my heart and took control away. And when I lost the life that everybody wants. Will you'd think they'd help you out. But they don't give a damn. They lift you up. (You might feel it, but don't believe it). You take your turn. (You'll see it, when you achieve it). They light that spark. (You can't fight it). Then sit back and watch you burn. They lift you up. (You might feel it, but don't believe it). Give you your task. (You'll see it, when you achieve it). When your world goes dark. (You can't hide it). They'll just smile and watch you burn. You can't believe a single word they say. You tried to have the life that everybody wants. Pretty soon you'll figure out that you don't. It's a scam. You're torn apart, and then you're thrown away. And you become the one that everybody talks. By then there's no way out. It's all part of the plan. They lift you up. (You might feel it, but don't believe it). You take your turn. (You'll see it, when you achieve it). They light that spark. (You can't fight it). Then sit back and watch you burn. They lift you up. (You might feel it, but don't believe it). Give you your task. (You'll see it, when you achieve it). When your world goes dark. (You can't hide it). They'll just smile and watch you burn. They lift you up. You take your turn. (You'll see it, when you achieve it). They light that spark. (You can't fight it). Then sit back and watch you burn. They lift you up. (You might feel it, but don't believe it). Give you your task.

Fall down on you. Who-o-o. Who-o-o. Who-o-o. Who the fuck are you. Who!. You and I. Where were once so. You and I. Hes was once incredable. You and I. We were once so. You and I. We were indavisable.

who taught you how to hate,"[Intro Verse]. I hear the voices echoing around me. Angered eyes that don't even know who I am. Looking to kill again. (They will kill again). As the unknown enemies surround me. Wicked laughter resonates inside my head. And I am filled with dread. (And adrenaline). What do I do?. Why do I deserve this?. So were different. Why do I deserve to die now?. Give me a reason why?. [Pre-Chorus 1]. Then it all goes a blur. Let instinct take flight. Find my hands on his throat. Yet hear myself say. [Chours]. Tell me now. Who taught you how to hate?. Because it isn't in your blood. Not a part of what you're made. So let this be understood. Somebody taught you how to hate. When you live this way, you become. Dead to everyone. [Verse 2]. A father's pride. My son walking beside me. I look around and marvel at the children play. In perfect disarray. (So innocent). No judgment, pure exhilaration. Not to wipe the colours are only in our minds. Nothing realigned. (All different). There's always one who plants an evil seed and. creatures here to pull you to the other side. Into a world of lies. [Pre-Chorus 2]. Everything is a chore when you lost your light. In a still beat your what made you this way. [Chours]. Tell me now. Who taught you how to hate?. Because it isn't in your blood. Not a part of what you're made. So let this be understood. Somebody taught you how to hate. When you live this way you become. Dead to everyone. (You're not anyone). Ohh Oohh. [Bridge]. Lost all innocence. Invented an arrogance. You burn. All your life. (No telling you). No deliverance. Consumed by the best events of hate. Don't deny. Deep in your heart does it remain do think. you can bring it back to life again?. Is it still in your soul?. (No saving you). Where's the deviant?. You're only a remnant. What has made you this way?. Lay before the disdain. [Outro]. Tell me now who taught you how to hate. because it isn't your blood. Not a part of what you're made. So let this be understood. Somebody taught you how to hate. When live this way you become. (You become). Tell me now who taught you how to hate. because it isn't in your blood. Not a part of what you're made. So let this be understood. Somebody taught you how to hate. When you live this way you become. (You become). You become. Dead to everyone. (You're not anyone)"
you're mine,"I've begun to realize. That no matter when I am with you. You deliver me from the pain in my life. Easy now to recognize. All the misery I have been through. It was beating me to submission. 'Till the day you arrived. Certainly, I felt alive. Strength I had lost was revived. I'm mending inside. And we both know why. Cause You're Mine. I knew I could be whole if. You were Mine. I'll vanquish any foe because. You're Mine. Been betrayed too many times. Didn't think I would ever recover. That it'd haunt me for the rest of my life. Then you opened up my eyes. And you helped me rediscover. With what you resurrected. A man who had died. Your power regave me new life. Made me reborn and refined. Rebuilt from inside and we both know why. Cause You're Mine. I knew I could be whole if. You were Mine. I'll vanquish any foe because. You're Mine. I never thought I would ever escape. At times I wanted to die. Feared that it all was just a little too late. Thought that I wouldn't survive. I let you in and let go of the hate. My heart recovered, now I. Owe you a debt that I can never repay. I still believe. Cause You're Mine. I'm burning inside and we both know why. Cause You're Mine. I knew I could be whole if. You were Mine. I'll vanquish any foe because. You're Mine. I can regain control because. You're Mine. I can take over the world because. You're Mine"
