she,"She. May be the face I can't forget.. A trace of pleasure or regret. May be my treasure or the price I have to pay.. She may be the song that summer sings.. May be the chill that autumn brings.. May be a hundred different things. Within the measure of a day.. She. May be the beauty or the beast.. May be the famine or the feast.. May turn each day into a heaven or a hell.. She may be the mirror of my dreams.. A smile reflected in a stream. She may not be what she may seem. Inside her shell. She who always seems so happy in a crowd.. Whose eyes can be so private and so proud. No one's allowed to see them when they cry.. She may be the love that cannot hope to last. May come to me from shadows of the past.. That I'll remember till the day I die. She. May be the reason I survive. The why and wherefore I'm alive. The one I'll care for through the rough and rainy years. Me I'll take her laughter and her tears. And make them all my souvenirs. For where she goes I've got to be. The meaning of my life is. She, she, she"
sparkling day,"Oh, it was such a sparkling day. That I should be singing its praises. Just to catch my senses as they slip away. But my sentences and phrases. Are about as worthless as wonder can be. And there are words that I could say. Perhaps I lack the sense of occasion. Seems that I've been looking down so long you see. That it seemed like up to me. I should be ashamed I'm sure you will agree. Pre Chrosus. So don't go calling out for Jude or Anthony. Maybe I was lost. I'm a hopeless case. So that every night I listen carefully. But there is no message from me. No message from me. Chorus. Sparkling day (x2). Things I never said. Some things you never heard. Sparkling day (x2). Now I wait in vain to see. That there was no message from me. When love is constant and content. You always fear some lingering temptation. Silhouettes escaping underneath locked doors. I'm astonished and amazed. Perhaps my message was erased.. Pre Chrosus. So don't go calling out for Jude or Anthony. Maybe I was lost. I'm a hopeless case. So that every night I listen carefully. But there is no message from me. No message from me. Chorus. Sparkling day (x2). Things I never said. Some things you never heard. Sparkling day (x2). Now I wait in vain to see. That there was no message from me"
alison,"Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long girl. And by the way look, I understand. That you are not impressed. But I heard you let that little friend of mine. Take off your party dress. I'm not gonna get too sentimental. Like those other sticky valentines. Cause I don't know if you are loving somebody. I only know it isn't mine. Alison. I know this world is killing you. Oh, Alison. My aim is true. Well I see you got a husband now. Did you leave your pretty fingers. Lying in the wedding cake. You used to hold him right in your hand. I bet it took all he could take. Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking. When I hear the silly things you say. I think somebody better put out the big light. Cause I can't stand to see you this way. Alison. I know this world is killing you. Oh, Alison. My aim is true"
(what's so funny 'bout) peace love and understanding,"As I walk through. This wicked world. Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.. I ask myself. Is all hope lost?. Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?. And each time I feel like this inside. There's one thing I wanna know. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. And as I walk on. Through troubled times. My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes. So where are the strong. And who are the trusted?. And where is the harmony?. Sweet harmony. 'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. So where are the strong?. And who are the trusted?. And where is the harmony?. Sweet harmony. 'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?."
beautiful,"Every day is so wonderful. And suddenly, it's hard to breathe. Now and then, I get insecure. From all the pain, I'm so ashamed. I am beautiful no matter what they say. Words can't bring me down. I am beautiful in every single way. Yes, words can't bring me down. So don't you bring me down today. To all your friends, you're delirious. So consumed in all your doom. Trying hard to fill the emptiness. The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone. Is that the way it is?. 'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say. Words can't bring you down. 'Cause you are beautiful in every single way. Yes, words can't bring you down. So don't you bring me down today. No matter what we do. No matter what we say. We're the song inside the tune. Full of beautiful mistakes. And everywhere we go. The sun will always shine. But tomorrow we might awake. On the other side. On the other side. We are beautiful in every single way. Words won't bring us down. We are beautiful in every single way. Yes, words can't bring us down. So, don't you bring me down today. Don't you bring me down today"
this is hell,"This Is Hell. . CHORUS:. This is hell, this is hell. I am sorry to tell you. It never gets better or worse. But you get used to it after a spell. For heaven is hell in reverse. The bruiser spun a hula hoop. As all the barmen preen and pout. The neon ""i"" of nightclub flickers on and off. And finally blew out. The irritating jingle. Of the belly-dancing phony Turkish girls. The eerie glare of ultra violet. Perfect dental work. CHORUS. The failed Don Juan in the big bow-tie. Is very sorry that he spoke. For he's mislaid his punch line. More than halfway through a very tasteless joke. The fré‹Ÿlein caught him peeking down her gown. He's yelling in her ear. And all at once the music stopped. As he was intimately bellowing ""My dear . ."". CHORUS. The shirt you wore with courage. And the violent nylon suit. Reappear upon your back. And undermine the polished line you try to shoot. It's not the torment of the flames. That finally see your flesh corrupted. It's the small humiliations that your memory piles up. This is hell, this is hell, this is hell.. ""My Favourite Things"" are playing. Again and again. But it's by Julie Andrews. And not by John Coltrane. Endless balmy breezes and perfect sunsets framed. Vintage wine for breakfast. And naked starlets floating in Champagne. All the passions of your youth. Are tranquillized and tamed. You may think it looks familiar. Though you may know it by another name. CHORUS."
when i was cruel no. 2,"I exit through the spotlight glare. I stepped out into thin air. Into a perfume so rarefied. ""Here comes the bride"". Not quite aside, they snide, ""She's number four"". ""There's number three just by the door"". Those in the know, don't even flatter her,. they go one better. ""She was selling speedboats in a tradeshow when he met her"". Look at her now. She's starting to yawn. She looks like she was born to it. But it was so much easier. When I was cruel. She reaches out her arms to me. Imploring: ""Another melody?"". So she can dance her husband out on the floor. The captains of industry just lie there where they fall. In eau-de-nil and pale carnation creation. A satin sash and velvet elevation. She straightens the tipsy head-dress of her spouse. While hers recalls a honey house. There'll be no sorrows left to drown. Early in the morning in your evening gown. But it was so much easier. When I was cruel. The entrance hall was arranged with hostesses and ushers. Who turned out to be the younger wives nursing schoolgirl crushes. Parting the waves of those few feint friends. Fingers once offered are now too heavy to extend. The ghostly first wife glides up on stage whispering to raucous talkers. Spilling family secrets out to flunkeys and castrato walkers. See that girl,. Watch that scene. Digging the ""Dancing Queen"". Two newspaper editors like playground sneaks. Running a book on which of them is going to last the week. One of them calls to me. And he says, ""I know you"". ""You gave me this tattoo back in '82"". ""You were a spoilt child then with a record to plug"". ""And I was a shaven headed seaside thug"". ""Things haven't really changed that much"". ""One of us is still getting paid too much"". There are some things I can't report. The memory of his last retort. But it was so much easier. When I was cruel. Look at me now. She's starting to yawn. She looks like she was born to it. Ah, but it was so much easier."
walk us uptown,Will you walk us uptown?. And wherever you go. You know we will follow. Will you walk us uptown?. And we'll stand in the light. Of your new killing ground. And we won't make a sound. Except to sing our sorrow. Will you walk us uptown?. While our tears run in torrents. To suffer in silence or pray for some solace. Will you wash away our sins. In the cross-fire and cross-currents. As you uncross your fingers. And take out some insurance. No matter what the price. It's your own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. Some hearts are sinking. And some hearts are a-flutter. Some scoop gold from the dirt in the gutter. Or swallow the earth. Pouring into your mouth. As they bury us upright saying. 'Everything's alright'. Will you walk us uptown?. Like some said that you could. We will feast on your flesh. And drink down your blood. Will you haul down that flag. And dishonour that vow. Cause we must not change. It's color now. Will you walk us uptown?. No matter what the price. Each crushed in the corner of their own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. That's always assuming. That you're partly divine and partly human. You're the king of our hearts. You're the clown with the drum. Will you walk us uptown?. If we promise not to run. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you gather us near. As cowards flee and traitors sneer. Keep a red flag flying. Keep a blue flag as well. And a white flag in case it all goes to hell
don't look now,"Don't look now, don't you dare. I'm not decent, go sit over there. Would you rather I was draped in priceless fur?. 'Cause there's nothing else to wear. Don't look now. I saw you shoot that glance. I said don't peek. At the sway of my dance. And the length of my limb. And the brush of my cheek. Okay, look at me now. What do you see?. I see you looking at me. Looking at how you looking at me. Oh, oh, oh. I know what you're thinking. I can read your mind. Oh, I promise, I'll be good this time. Now I wonder what you see. Will you be thinking of me?. Later on, when you're alone. Are you ever alone in longing?. I'll sit here silent and still. See if I'm breaking your will. I see you looking at me. Looking at how you looking at me. Oh, don't look at me now"
this year's girl,"See her picture in a thousand places. 'Cause she's this year's girl. You think you all own little pieces. Of this year's girl. Forget your fancy manners. Forget your English grammar. 'Cause you don't really give a damn. About this year's girl. Still you're hoping that she's well spoken. 'Cause she's this year's girl. You want her broken with her mouth wide open. 'Cause she's this year's girl. Never knowing it's a real attraction. All these promises of satisfaction. While she's being bored to distraction. Being this year's girl. Time's running out. She's not happy with the cost. There'd be no doubt. Only she's forgotten much more than she's lost. A bright spark might corner the market. In this year's girl. You see yourself rolling on the carpet. With this year's girl. Those disco synthesizers. Those daily tranquilizers. Those body building prizes. Those bedroom alibis. All this, but no surprises for this year's girl. All this, but no surprises for this year's girl. All this, but no surprises for this year's girl."
all the rage,"1-2-3,2-2-3. The twitching impulses to speak your mind. I'll lend you my microscope and maybe you will find it. Is it in that ugly place that's just behind your face. Where you keep my picture still despite the fact. That you had me replaced. CHORUS:. Say ""Goodbye"". Baby can't you act your age?. You know why. I'm going to give it to you straight. Although I'll never be. Unhappy as you want me to be. Still it's all the rage. I'll probably play along. Left to my own devices. Spare me the drone of your advice. The sins of garter and gin. Confession may delay. You know the measuring pole. The merry boots of clay. I've heard it all before. You'll say it anyway. CHORUS. Alone with your tweezers and your handkerchief. You murder time and truth, love, laughter and belief. So don't try to touch my heart, it's darker than you think. And don't try to read my mind because it's full of disappearing ink. CHORUS. Although I'll never be. Unhappy as you want me to be. Still it's all the rage."
human hands,"I've been talking to the wall and it's been answering me. Oh darling how I miss you. I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness. I crave the silhouette of your kiss. With only the blue light of the TV on. Lip reading threats and false alarms. There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself. And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn. Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt. That it's you that I'm dreaming about. Do I have to draw you a diagram?. All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands. With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze. Checkmate in three moves in your heyday. But the girls don't listen to your line anymore. Now you're part of someone else. On the factory floor and you still say ""Wheres the action?"". Now you manufacture happiness. And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction. (chorus). All you toy soldiers and scaremongers. Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder. In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before. Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly. You know I love you more than slightly. Although I've never said it like this before. (chorus)."
stripping paper,I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. It's amazin' what you will. find stripping paper. When you get down to the past. Back then we didn't have means. for fine decorations. So we painted while mixing wine. with flirtation. There in the mess of it all. He took me right there in the thrill. Not quite against my will. With my back to that rococo wall. We slipped right down to the floor. I can't close the door. he complimented my taste. I anointed his serious face. with wallpaper [pics?]. I wish we could laugh like that now. But what seemed to follow. That ended up hollow. [Was I there?]. Tear a strip or two. See what what came not much later. Here's a pony and a toy balloon. Behind the [violet?] all too soon. Here's the pencil of a measurin' mark. And the monsters you spied in the dark. Now I got no place in her heart. Let me go back to the start. I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. I've got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper
don't let me be misunderstood,"B.Benjamin/S.Marcus/C.Cadwell. Baby can you understand me now. Sometimes I feel a little mad. Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel. When things go wrong I seem to be mad. (Chorus). I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood. Baby sometimes I'm so carefree. With a joy that's hard to hide. Other times it seems that all I have to do is worry. And then I know you're bound to see my other side. Chorus. If I get mad at you I want you to know. That I never mean to take it out on you. Life has its problems and I get my share. But that is one thing I would never do 'cause I love you. Oh don't you know I'm human. I've got my faults just like any one. Sometimes I lie awake long regretting. Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done."
i wanna be loved,Why must I be so lonely?. When so many people pass me by. I've been waiting for oh so long now. And yet I'm unable to answer why. I can't be made to give up now. Can you find room for me. in your heart somehow?. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved. I guess I'm a victim of loneliness. But why should this be my destiny?. A foolish man for a lot of my life. Shouldn't there be someone. Someone for me?. I hope and I pray some happy day. That I'll be around to hear you say. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved. .
brilliant mistake,"He thought he was the King of America. Where they pour Coca Cola just like vintage wine. Now I try hard not to become hysterical. But I'm not sure if I am laughing or crying. I wish that I could push a button. And talk in the past and not the present tense. And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear. Like it was common sense. It was a fine idea at the time. Now it's a brilliant mistake. She said that she was working for the ABC News. It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use. Her perfume was unspeakable. It lingered in the air. Like her artificial laughter. Her mementos of affairs. ""Oh"" I said ""I see you know him"". ""Isn't that very fortunate for you"". And she showed me his calling card. He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two. He was a fine idea at the time. Now he's a brilliant mistake. He thought he was the King of America. But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams. A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals. The words of love in whispers. And the acts of love in screams. I wish that I could push a button. And talk in the past and not the present tense. And watch this lovin' feeling disappear. Like it was common sense. I was a fine idea at the time."
this house is empty now,"These rooms play tricks upon you. Remember when they were always filled with laughter?. But now they're quite deserted. They seem to just echo voices raised in anger. Maybe you will see my face. Reflected there on the pane. In the window of our poor. Forlorn and broken home. Still this house is empty now. There's nothing I can do. To make you want to stay. So tell me how. Am I supposed to live without you?. These walls were lined with pictures. Remember the glass we charged in celebration?. But now I fill my life up. With all that I can to deaden this sensation. Do you recognize the face. Fixed in that fine silver frame. Were you really so unhappy then?. You never said. So this house is empty now. There's nothing I can do. To make you want to stay. So tell me how. Am I supposed to live without you?. Oh, if I could just become forgetful. When night seems endless. Does the extinguished candle care. About the darkness?. It's funny how my mem’ry. Will bring you so close then make you disappear. Meanwhile all our friends must choose. Who they will favour, who they will lose. Hang the garland high or close the door. And throw away the key. This house is empty now. There's no one living here. You have to care about. This house is empty now. There's nothing I can do. To make you want to stay. So tell me how. Am I supposed to live without you?. This house is empty now. There's no one living here. You have to care about. This house is empty now. There's nothing I can do. To make you want to stay. So tell me how. Am I supposed to live without you?."
god give me strength,"Now I have nothing. So God give me strength. 'Cos I'm weak anyway. And if I'm strong I might still break. And I don't have anything to share. That I won't throw away into the air. That song is sung out. This bell is rung out. She was the light that I'd bless. She took my last chance of happiness. So God give me strength. God give me strength. I can't hold on to her. God give me strength. When the phone doesn't ring. And I'm lost in imagining. Everything that kind of love is worth. As I tumble back down to the earth. That song is sung out. This bell is rung out. She was the light that I'd bless. She took my last chance of happiness. So God give me strength. God if she'd grant me her indulgence and decline. I might as well. Wipe her from my memory. Fracture the spell. As she becomes my enemy. Maybe I was washed out. Like a lip-print on his shirt. See, I'm only human. I want him to hurt. I want him. I want him to hurt. Since I lost the power to pretend. That there could ever be a happy ending. That song is sung out. This bell is rung out. She was the light that I'd bless. She took my last chance of happiness. So God give me strength. God give me strength."

watch your step,Don't say a word. Don't say anything. Don't say a word. I'm not even listening. I read in the paper about their escape. They're just two BITTER kids WITH a bunch of sour grapes. You better watch your step. Watch who's knocking on your front door. Now you know that they're watching. What are you waiting for?. Think you're young and original. Get out before.... They get to watch your step. Ev'ry day is full of fun. And family spies. They're making heroes out of fall guys. They say it's good for business. From Singapore to Widnes. You better watch your step. Broken noses hung up on the wall. Back slapping drinkers cheer the heavy weight brawl. So punch drunk they don't understand at all. You better watch your step. Ev'ry night. Go out full of carnival desires. End up in the closing time choirs. When you're kicking in the courtroom. And you're drinking down the Eau de Cologne. And you're spitting out the Kodachrome. You better watch your step. Bye. I send you all my regards. You're so tough. You're so hard. Listen to the hammers falling in the breaker's yard. You better watch your step. You better watch your step.
i'll never fall in love again,What do you get when you fall in love?. A girl with a pin to burst your bubble. That's what you get for all your trouble. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. What do you get when you kiss a girl?. You get enough germs to catch pneumonia. After you do she'll never phone you. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. Don't tell me what it's all about. 'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out. Out of those chains those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you. What do you get when you give your heart?. You get it all broken up and battered. That's what you get a heart that's shattered. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. Out of those chains those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you. What do you get when you fall in love?. You only get lies and pain and sorrow. So for at least until tomorrow. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again.
under lime,"It's a long way down from the high. horse you're on. When you stumble and then you're thrown. The last time we say him he was. out in the rain. Watchin' that train roll down the track. Now he's back in showbiz. Peddlin' his comeback. . We know that he's desperate. and we know that he's broke. He's the mystery guest we'll puncture. They told a young girl with. a clipboard ""Just keep him amused"". Whatever you do, don't tell him your name. Whatever you say, don't let him drink. Under lime, under lime, under lime. . He whistles out of tune. His words don't always rhyme. ""But we will be right back. ""We're almost out of time"". Down a long corridor he's trying to impress. He was helpin' a showgirl fasten up her dress. . And the clock on the wall tick-tocked. the time away. And the band starts to play. . In the violent strip of an undressing room. She loosened his grip and started. Tell me your story, if you feel so inclined. He was a mess, almost resigned. Though she could guess, I think you will find. She thought, ""Oh you know, I wouldn't mind"". He asked he boyfriend's name. Then her whole family tree. She thought ""I can't believe it's. happening to me"". And upset, said ""Hey pet. ""Would you kindly pass that pill. And allow me to just dictate my dying will. And the clock on the wall tick-tocked. the time away. And the band starts to play. Jimmy was dreamin' as she uncrossed he legs. He shuttered his eyes discreetly. And he thought of a drummer. and considered a snare. But the beat of his heart. Said, ""Don't even start"". His conscience was bare. Said, ""Hey, don't even dare"". She's completely unaware. She forced a laugh or a sigh. At every alibi. Once every crime was confessed. He buttoned up his vest. Said ""Hey gal, you'r a pal. ""You've really been a sport. And you don't get a record. If you never get caught. And the clock on the wall. tick-tocked the time away. And the band starts to play. It's a long way down from the high horse. you're on. It's a long way back as you cover your track. Or you bury your crime. Under lime, under lime, under lime. under lime. It's a long way down from the high. horse you're on. It's a long way back as you cover your track. Or you bury your crime. Under lime, under lime, under lime. under lime.

high fidelity,Some things you never get used to. Even though you're feeling like another man. There's nothing that he can do for you. To shut me away as you walk through. Lovers laughing in their amateur hour. Holding hands in the corridors of power. Even though I'm with somebody else right now. High fidelity. Can you hear me?. There's a new kind of dedication. Maybe you'll find it down the tunnel. Maybe I got above my station. Maybe you're only changing channel. Even though you're nowhere near me. And I know you kiss him so sincerely now. Even though the signal's indistinct. And you worry what silly people think. Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out. I bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millions. I suppose he'll never know about.
imperial bedroom,"Everyone agreed that she looked delightful. Except for her sister, who was hateful and spiteful. Blushing bright red from her head to her feet. But rushing into her bridal suite. The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. Life turns out like a TV serial. A head full of daydreams, his hands full of material. She says it's nothing, he's messing up her hair. And still he looks so neat. Stepping into the bridal suite. The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. So the best man will do his best again. Now they're getting dressed again. Blushing bright red from her head to her feet. Sneaking out of the bridal suite. The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. We know who you're with and where you are. In the imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. Two names under the register. In the imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. Au revoir."
sugar won't work,Lightning Up!. And shake the ground. Is that a horn that's blowing?. Or a bell that's tolling?. Walls are falling. Ships pulled out from their mooring. Is that a river or just a road the storm has stolen?. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work. Lightning Up!. And fly the coop. Far from this tin-pan alley oop. Did you think I was your dupe?. I hear such lies and howlers. Words to pull out your molars. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work. Lightning Up!. Sugar the pill. A wall of ocean ten miles high. Metal darts torn from the sky. Like wanton boys make noise pull wings from flies. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work

So she swept it off her face. Let me find the words and say them. Like some softly whispered ""Amen"". But she starts to pull away. And the lights begin to dim. Is she thinking of me?. Or is she thinking of him?. She's pulling out the pin?. She's slipping off the hook. Unbuttoning her dress. She's slipping off the hook. There's just enough to make some man a mess. She tears away the veil. With her fingernails. She came out high and kicking. While the band played ""Hey, Good Looking"". Do you hear something ticking?. Did somebody tell her she could really be redeemed?. And could she actually be as desperate as she seems?. She's tearing at the seams. She's going to extremes. Nobody told her it was a sin. So she's pulling out the pin. She's taping up her hands just like a boxer will. And they started laughing. But if looks could kill. She'd take them down right now. She's covering her mouth. With some unholy vow. There's nothing more to say. This is her wedding day. Full of shattered glass and mayhem. Not some softly whispered ""Amen"". While the shock announcement dawns. And the smoke begins to thin. Where the world without ends. And the next one begins. She's pulling out the pin. She's pulling out the pin. She's pulling out the pin. She's pulling out the pin"
(the angels wanna wear my) red shoes,"Oh I used to be disgusted. and now I try to be amused.. But since their wings have got rusted,. you know, the angels wanna wear my red shoes.. But when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain,. that's when I knew that I could not refuse.. And I won't get any older, now the angels wanna wear my red shoes.. I was watching while you're dancing away.. Our love got fractured in the echo and sway.. How come everybody wants to be your friend?. You know that it still hurts me just to say it.. Oh, I know that she's disgusted (oh why's that). Cause she's feeling so abused. (oh that's too bad). She gets tired of the lust, (oh I'm so sad). but it's so hard to refuse.. How can you say that I'm too old,. when the angels have stolen my red shoes.. Oh, I said ""I'm so happy, I could die."". She said ""Drop dead,"" then left with another guy.. That's what you get if you go chasing after vengeance.. Ever since you got me punctured this has been my sentence.. Oh I used to be disgusted. and now I try to be amused.. But since their wings have got rusted,. you know, the angels wanna wear my red shoes.. Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes.."
(the) fall of the world's own optimist,"There's no charity in you. And that surprises me. I guess I thought you were a golden idol. 'Cause I called you majesty. On the balustrade. You watched me hunt for tips I was obliged to pick up. From the passing trade. [Chorus:]. Hey, kids - look at this. It's the fall of the world's own optimist. I could get back up if you insist. But you'll have to ask politely. 'Cause the eggshells I've been treading. Couldn't spare me a beheading. And I'll know I had it coming. From a Caesar who was only slumming. Hey, kids - look at this. It's the fall of the world's own optimist. Well, I could have objections. Which you could override. But what's the point - we're only flogging the horse. When the horseman has up and died. Once I testified. And swore I'd never leave a stone unturned -. I bet you're really glad that I lied. [Chorus]. Hey, kids - look at this. It's the fall of the world's own optimist. I could get back up if you insist. But you'll have to ask politely. Yes, you'll have to ask politely. Yes, you'll have to ask"
(what's so funny 'bout) peace love and understanding,"As I walk through. This wicked world. Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.. I ask myself. Is all hope lost?. Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?. And each time I feel like this inside. There's one thing I wanna know. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. And as I walk on. Through troubled times. My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes. So where are the strong. And who are the trusted?. And where is the harmony?. Sweet harmony. 'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. So where are the strong?. And who are the trusted?. And where is the harmony?. Sweet harmony. 'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?. What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?.

... this town ...,"That Charlie Sedarka was a-playing the piano. like he was pawing a dirty book. He bit a hole in his big bottom lip and gave his. very best little boy look. It was a song with a topical verse which I'm. afraid he then proceeded to sing. Something about the moody doomed love of. the Fish-Finger King. Chorus:. You're nobody in this town. You're nobody in this crowd. You're nobody 'til everybody in this town. knows you're poison,. Got your number knows it must be avoided. You're nobody 'til everybody in this town. thinks you're a bastard. Mr. Getgood moved up to Self-Made Man Row. Although he swears that he's the salt of the earth. He's so proud of the ""kick-me-hard"" sign that. they hung on his back at birth. He said ""I appreciate beauty, if I have one, then. it's my fault"". ""Beauty is on my pillow, beauty is there in. my vault"". Chorus. The girl with the eternity rock went down on. her bookie to buy some stock. Now all her signs in the shopping arcades say. ""The corporation thief is The New Jesse James"". Her clothes and her attention were scant, her. eyes were everywhere,. Her eyes were like abstinthe. The little green figures that dance on his screen. say everything you want to hear and nothing. they mean. They made love while she was changing her dress. She wiped him off she wiped him out and then. she made him confess. A little amused by the belief in her power. You must remember this it was the fetish of. the hour."
...and in every home,You turn to the sinister when you get the boot. Sliding down the banister in your Sunday suit. Lying on a slag heap of blankets and magazines. She's only thirty-five going on seventeen. You'd better roll over and go to sleep if you don't come clean. And in every home there will be lots of time. I will be all yours you might have been admired. (And in every home there will be lots of time). They say they're very sorry but you are not desired. Oh heaven preserve us. Oh heaven preserve us. Oh heaven preserve us. Because they don't deserve us. Holding your life in your hand. With an artificial limp wrist. And so a young blade becomes a has-been. Looking for a new twist. A year after the wedding he broke all their china plates. He's in prison now she's running with his mates. Sees him every Sunday. And he asks her where she's been. She's only thirty-five going on seventeen. She's going to cop a packet if he ever finds her. In between the sheets. (chorus). .
...dust,"If dust could only talk. What would we hear it say?. before it's brushed aside. Just as it's swept away. It's just the evidence. It's of no consequence. It's only flesh and bone. Why don't you leave it alone?. If dust could only gather into lines of chalk. Around a silhouette detective fiction walks. For it's the only witness that can testify. Can I spit out the truth. Or would you rather just swallow a lie?. Why did they dam the land?. How did they flood the plain?. Did they erase the name?. And wipe away the stain. You kept your mouth well shut. Appeared to turn your coat. Now there's a name for you but it's stuck in my throat. If dust could only mutter. Or in laughter trill. If it could warn and whisper from the windowsill. For it's the only witness that can testify. Can I spit out the truth?. Or would you rather just swallow a lie?. Here comes the juggernaut. Here come The Poisoners. They choke the life and land. And rob the joy from us. Why do they taste of sugar. When they are made of money. Here come the Lamb of God. And the butcher's boy, Sonny. If dust could only gather in a needle track. Then it would skip a beat and it would jump right back. If dust could only gather in a needle track. Then it would skip a beat. And all the sense I lack."
13 steps lead down,"When nobody knows she puts on secret clothes. And lies in the meadow with her hands tied behind her back. I won't refuse if you know how to use it. Just stop playing that ugly drug music. CHORUS:. Thirteen steps lead down. Thirteen steps lead down. There's commoners and kings. And everyone's a prisoner of. Paper and glue. And a decent pair of scissors. So tonight I'm drinking to your health. Because I just can't stand myself. Thirteen steps lead down [4x]. She stands and fails. On fashion fingernails. Her lovers have her walking 'round. On instruments of torture. And one of them is poisonous. The other is a thief they say. So what one could give to her. The other cannot take away. When nobody knows she puts on secret clothes. And lies in her splendour for a picture opportunity. Cover up that bruise, put on patent leather shoes. Just stop playing that bad mood music. CHORUS."
15 petals,15 Petals. One for every year I spent with you. Jewels and precious metals will never do. I love you twisted. And I love you straight. I'd write it down but I can't concentrate. Words won't me obey they do as they please. And all I am left with is these.... 15 Petals. One for every year I spent with you. Jewels and precious metals will never do. The thorn is blunted. And The perfume will fade. I stand where sun is set. I crave the shade. Down in the tavern with Mary and Joe. Palms reached for alms as they throw. 15 Petals.... One for every hour that we're apart. Tears and useless battles. I'll never start. Mussolini highway. There's a frankincense tree. I picked some up there to carry with me. You take me to places where I never go. I love you more than you know. 15 Petals. Scattered in the path where you will tread. 15 Petals. Of vivid red. One wine-bar vamp with the polythene. Ein Panzer Kommander with no hair in place.

And you're obsolete and they can't afford to educate you (20% amnesia). In his bedtime boot boy jersey. Ringing up some fantasy tart. Give me strength or give me mercy. Life intimidates art. CHORUS:. Give me strength or give me mercy. Don't let me lose heart. From rage to anaesthesia. Twenty percent amnesia. Were you passed out on the sofa (20% amnesia). While justice was bartered by a drunken oaf? (20% amnesia). This is all your glorious country thinks of your life (20% amnesia). Stripped Jack naked with a Stanley knife (20% amnesia). So the German Queen went home again. But she couldn't find forgiveness. They made a fist of her hand of friendship. But it's only business. CHORUS. The wine you drink has never seen a grape. And now your sci-fi suit has lost its shape. But its a dangerous game that comedy plays. Sometimes it tells you the truth, sometimes it delays it. Think back, think back if you still can. When the trumpet sounded and the world began. Somebody said ""We must have won"". So they started burying the boogeyman. Mister Gorbachov came cap in hand (20% amnesia). From a bankrupt land to a bankrupt land (20% amnesia). Mister Gorbachov and some other fella (20% amnesia). Were taken to a show called ""Cinderella"" (20% amnesia).

45,"Bells are chiming for victory. There's a page back in history. 45. They came back to the world that they fought for. Didn't turn out just like they thought. 45. Here is a song to sing to do the measuring. What you lose, what you gain, what you win?. Nine years later a child is born. There's a record, so you put it on. 45. Nine years more, if we're lucky now. Nine-year-old puts his money down. 45. Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat. Every breath that I held for you. 45. There's a stack of shellac and vinyl. Which is yours now and which is mine?. 45. Here is a song to sing to do the measuring. What you lose, what you gain, what you win?. Bass and treble heal every hurt. There's a rebel in a nylon shirt. But the words are a mystery, I've heard. 'Til you turn it down to 33 and 1/3. 'Cos it helps with the elocution. Corporations turn revolutions. 45. So don't you weep and shed. Just change your name instead. What you lose when it all goes to your head?. I heard something peculiar said:. ""Perhaps he's got a shot and now he's dead"". 45. Bells are chiming and tears are falling. It creeps up on you without a warning. 45. Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat. Every breath that I bless. I'd be lost, I confess."
5ive gears in reverse,Five gears in reverse. For girls looking at the big lift. Somebody send out for the night nurse. Please don't stick me on the late shift. If you don't know by now. Nobody's gonna tell you. If you don't know by now. The shock will probably kill you. But if your patience is corrupted and you still cannot decide. You're sitting in the garage contemplating suicide. And you have no motivation you can't even catch your breath. All of this acceleration is driving you to death. Five gears in reverse. You think I don't know what I'm doing. Another fashionable first. Like walking down the road to ruin. But if you're safe and sound. Don't let me interrupt you. And if you're gagged and bound. Well how can I corrupt you.
a town called big nothing,"Big nothing.. He stood in the road outside of town with a broken clockwork toy in. his hand: A graveyard for childish dreams in his palm; a broken lifeline.. Big nothing.. The mechanical amusement sputtered in his fist. As he clenched, it. whirred and died again. It was a cowboy who drew his gun, but the. pistol was welded to the holster by age and careless children, so it. struggled and strained and it unwound his own spring.. Big nothing.. He didn't need tattoos to show where he had been and who he had loved. It. was the same thing that men had cried for; that women had dyed their hair. for. The cellophane illusion of a starry sky stretched over an open sore.. Big nothing.. He thought about his lost daughter: the way her eyes would alight at the. greedy circus barker's blackmail song; how he wanted to smash her skull. when she parroted back, 'tell mommy; tell poppy; you need this little. dolly.'. Big nothing. (x2). The smoky voice of the petaled girl woke him long enough. There was too. much light in the room, so he unscrewed the bulb. She took him to bed like. an adopted dog.. Big nothing.. She lit sickly incense, as he tried to tell if the resemblance was pure. and coincidental. He unleashed his grip on the toy, all it meant to him,. and it wound down forever.. Big nothing.. He woke up in a sweat. The next day, with her smile still painted on his. mouth, he walked out of a town called Big Nothing.. Big nothing. (repeat until fade)."
abandoned masquerade,The glitter on a paint and plaster face. Is covering desire and disgrace. We could be lovers. But no one suspects at all. Once you're inside that costume ball. And now I'm sitting here before the mirror. I have the skill still to disguise my tears. Then as the magic starts to fade. I find myself abandoning the masquerade. Even though you're suffering. You try to hide it. And pretend you're so nonchalant. You can cry a pool of tears. And sit beside it. Then perhaps you'll know what you want. I hope you never feel this much despair. Or know the meaning of that empty chair. As the illusions that we made all fade away. In this abandoned masquerade
accidents will happen,"Oh I just don't know where to begin. Though he says he'll wait forever. It's now or never. But she keeps him hanging on. The silly champion. She says she can't go home. Without a chaperone. Accidents will happen. We only hit and run. He used to be your victim. Now you're not the only one. Accidents will happen. We only hit and run. I don't want to hear it. cause I know what I've done. There's so many fish in the sea. That only rise up in the sweat and smoke like mercury. But they keep you hanging on. They say you're so young. Your mind is made up but your mouth is undone. (chorus). And it's the damage that we do. And never know. It's the words that we don't say. That scare me so. There's so many people to see. So many people you can check up on. And add to your collection. But they keep you hanging on. Until you're well hung. Your mouth is made up but your mind is undone. (chorus). I know, I know, (repeat)"
after the fall,"In an anonymous rendezvous. Where the forbidden lovers repair. They're burning down another damn candle. They're melting the tables and chairs. Beneath them applause from the balcony. whenever they accomplished making love. Other times they thought they heard laughter. Coming from the balcony above. CHORUS. She lies to his right and she carelessly recites. All of her brand new appetites. She seems brittle and small, it don't sound like her at all. Since she came back to him after the fall. She said ""You never visit the countryside"". ""So I've made you a country to order"". She put up a little tent in the bedroom. Crickets played on a tape-recorder. The ceiling was festooned with phosphorous stars. She noticed his skin turning cold. Burning all his clothes on the bonfire. ""Relax"" she whispered and tightened the blindfold. CHORUS. You've changed but not for the better babe. I'd tell you why but what's the use. 'Cos it's the same kind of pity. A drunkard gives as his excuse. You were sharp and ideal as a bobby pin. Now your eyes are deserted and quiet. We both look like those poor shattered mannequins. Thrown through the window in the riot. She lies in his arms and without any qualms. Revels in shallow delights. She seems brittle and small, it don't sound like her at all."

alison,"Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long girl. And by the way look, I understand. That you are not impressed. But I heard you let that little friend of mine. Take off your party dress. I'm not gonna get too sentimental. Like those other sticky valentines. Cause I don't know if you are loving somebody. I only know it isn't mine. Alison. I know this world is killing you. Oh, Alison. My aim is true. Well I see you got a husband now. Did you leave your pretty fingers. Lying in the wedding cake. You used to hold him right in your hand. I bet it took all he could take. Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking. When I hear the silly things you say. I think somebody better put out the big light. Cause I can't stand to see you this way. Alison. I know this world is killing you. Oh, Alison. My aim is true"
all grown up,"""I'm trouble"" she said. Spread out on the floor of her father's house. Her promise was almost undone. Under her tongue, dissolving her responsibilities. To finally deny everyone with unflattering comparison. CHORUS. All grown up. And you don't care anymore. And you hate all the people that you used to adore. And you despise all the rumors and lies of the life you led before. Did I hear you right?. You're feeling hounded and pushed around. You want to just lay down and die. If all of this life has been such a big disappointment to you. Why don't you stop blaming some guy. And go give the next one a try. CHORUS. But look at yourself. You'll see you're still so young. You haven't earned the weariness. That sounds so jaded on your tongue. ""I'm weak"" she says. And blesses herself and gets into bed. Clutching the covers to her throat. ""So punish me now and let me go back to the sham of my life"". ""This night is the perfect antidote for all of the poison that. you wrote"". CHORUS."
all the rage,"1-2-3,2-2-3. The twitching impulses to speak your mind. I'll lend you my microscope and maybe you will find it. Is it in that ugly place that's just behind your face. Where you keep my picture still despite the fact. That you had me replaced. CHORUS:. Say ""Goodbye"". Baby can't you act your age?. You know why. I'm going to give it to you straight. Although I'll never be. Unhappy as you want me to be. Still it's all the rage. I'll probably play along. Left to my own devices. Spare me the drone of your advice. The sins of garter and gin. Confession may delay. You know the measuring pole. The merry boots of clay. I've heard it all before. You'll say it anyway. CHORUS. Alone with your tweezers and your handkerchief. You murder time and truth, love, laughter and belief. So don't try to touch my heart, it's darker than you think. And don't try to read my mind because it's full of disappearing ink. CHORUS. Although I'll never be. Unhappy as you want me to be. Still it's all the rage."
all this useless beauty,"It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit. If she wasn't so ladylike. She imagines how she might have lived. back when legends and history collide. So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly. slumped at her side. Those days are recalled on the gallery wall. And she's waiting for passion or humour to strike. What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?. All this useless beauty. Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time. 'Til he almost began to negotiate. She held his head like a baby and said ""It's okay if you cry"". Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess. He desires to impress his associates. But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased. So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny. Chorus. She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books. That were later disgraced to face celluloid. It won't even make sense but you can bet. If she isn't a sweetheart or plaything or pet. The film turns her into an unveiled threat. Nonsense prevails, modesty fails. Grace and virtue turn into stupidity. While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise. And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts. They still think they're the gods of antiquity. If something you missed didn't even exist. It was just an ideal -- is it such a surprise?. Chorus [x2]."

almost ideal eyes,"Here she comes with her almost ideal eyes. and her flawless skin and her petulant pout. The memory of such a long blond alibi. still makes me want to shout out loud. You ************ when you clear your head my dear. you can't come out here in those stolen clothes. Telling me all about some mystery. I hope she isn't one, I hope she isn't one of those. Almost ideal eyes. Viewed through a rosey hue. so beautiful, trusting. You find liberal is an insult now and care is what you pay for. Be sure of what you're wishing for, be careful what you pray for. When you look into those almost ideal. Love is smiles, he will hypnotize you wild. He tries to analyze your dreams. Fill you up with all his big ideas while he really wants to make you. Scream out loud at the phony innocence. and pained pretence and the dismal rage.. The vacant lot that thankfully time forgot. Where you never have to act, you never have to act your age. Almost ideal eyes. Viewed through a rosey hue. so beautiful, trusting. you find stupid is a compliment and thrill is what you play for. Be sure of what you're wishing for, be careful what you pray for. When you look into those almost ideal eyes. In the spirit(?) all your friends look uglier. and you find you're wearing an evening gown. Weeping over some tiny broken bird. while the sky is decorated. shocking pink and a dirty shade of brown. and you think you need to be tranquilized. a feat that may fit to your new career. Whatever you invent you'll never be content with. Almost ideal eyes. Viewed through a rosey hue. so beautiful, trusting. rebellion is just currency, the moon is what you pay for. be sure of what you're looking for, be careful what you pray for. when you look into those almost ideal eyes. Here she comes, here she comes now......"

Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you. I can't say more it would be telling. For if you don't what will become of you. Just isn't worth any king's shilling. I will answer when they make that call, pull upon this ragged uniform. Up 'til now I know it's been your trade. Spit and polish the potato parade. Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you. I can't say more it would be telling. For if you don't what will become of you. Just isn't worth any king's shilling. Please don't put your silly head in that pretty soldier's hat. You've done your duty, that's enough of that. I don't know if what I'm doing is right. I don't know if you should be forgiving. But for me it seems it means my life. While for you it could just be a living. Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you. I can't say more it would be telling. For if you don't what will become of you. Just isn't worth any king's shilling. Please don't put your silly head in that British soldier's hat. You've done your duty that's enough of that. You're a fine one, oh yes you are."
ascension day,"Not a soul was stirrin'. Not a bird was singin'. Least not within my hearin'. I was five minutes past carin'. Standing in the road just starin'. Thought I heard somebody pleadin'. Thought I heard someone apologize. Some fell down weepin'. Others shook their fists up at the skies. And those who were left. Seemed to be wearing disguises. Now there's a queen in waitin'. Not enough lovin' and too much hatin'. Was the prince hidden within her man?. Always seems to be hesitatin'. He said, ""Let her go, let her go, God bless her. She hasn't been gone long enough for me to miss her. Except every minute of every hour of every day. When I wish I could possess her"". 40 days passed by, 40 alibis. So carry on that way. And in time you'll pay. But we'll all be together. Come Ascension Day. Not a hound was howlin'. Or whimperin' or prowlin'. Now the wind had departed. Not a leaf was hangin' on the tree. Like when it started. But I know they will return. Like they've never gone away. Come Ascension Day"
b movie,"I found America hiding in the corner of my wallet. It's a well kept secret, thought that I had better swallow it. Before they make me spit out the truth. Before they find you're lying about your youth. B movie, that's all you are to me. Just a soft soap story. Don't want the woman to adore me. You can't stand it when it goes from real to reel. Too real too real. You can't stand it when I throw punch lines you can feel. All the time, there's a rule book in Brittania. That no one ever waives. And everybody's on the make. It's not your heart I want to break. Turn out the lights. I'm thinking that I want to go to sleep now. Just give me a promise that I'm supposed to keep now. I don't want some fool asking me why. When I find you're finally making me cry."
baby it's you,"(Sha, la, la, la...). It's not the way you look that touched my heart.. It's not the way you kissed me, baby, that tears me apart.. Many, many nights I tried. I sit alone at home and I cried over you.. What can I do? I can't help myself, cause baby, it's you.. You should hear the things they say about you.. They say you're never, ever, ever, ever gonna be true. Oh.. I don't listen to a word they say. I'm gonna love you any old way.. What can I do? It's true. I can't help myself, cause baby, it's you.. I don't listen to a word they say. I'm gonna love you any old way.. What can I do? It's true. I can't help myself, cause baby, it's you.. Baby, it's you.."
baby plays around,"It's not open to discussion anymore. She's out again tonight and I'm alone once more. She's all I have worth waiting for. But baby plays around. And so it seems I've always been the last to know. To hold on to that girl, I had to let her go. I wish to God I didn't love her so. 'Cos baby plays around. I try to be strong hold on to my pride. She doesn't even know it's wrong, how much I hurt Inside. And heaven knows I've tried. But baby plays around. just a plaything. It's hard to reconcile the facts I'm facing. It's not open to discussion anymore. She walks those shiny streets. I walk the worn out floor. She's all I have worth living for."
baby's got a brand new hairdo,"Baby's got a brand-new hairdo, and doesn't she look so nice?. She said everything that she cares to, she said it not once but twice. She said it doesn't matter unless it's her matters. Well, I don't care 'bout all. The girl that used to love it, and the girl I still hate. Baby's got a brand-new hairdo, and doesn't she look so fine?. She said everything that she used to,. Except she's picking your heart, not mine. She said ""it doesn't matter unless I say it matters"". She said pretty pink things on silver platters. I don't care about all the moms and dads. The girl that used to love it, and girl I still hate. She's the girl that used to love it, and the girl I still hate. Baby's got a brand-new hairdo, and doesn't she look so good?. She looks like Jennifer Harlow, said I wish you would. I wish you would. Baby's got a brand new hairdo , I wonder what's left inside. She used to meet me at The Mens room, before she learned how to be snide. She walks in the place and everybody scatters. I don't care about all the martin dress. She's the girl who used to love it and the girl I used to hate."
back on my feet,"How many days will the wet weather last?. I want to know will the clouds. When they roll back. Reveal a man in an old mac. Living on a park bench. Sitting on his own?. Cut to the rain as it runs down the glass. Eventually through the lightning and thunder. We see a man going under. This is how it happens. This is what he said. He said, ""I don't need love. Though temptation is sweet. Give me your hand. 'Til I'm back on me feet. You're always telling me about my misery. I've seen things you'll never see. Don't pity me."". Focus in on the breath of a man. Who takes a brown paper bag. From his knapsack. Between his whispers and wise cracks. He's looking for permission. Screaming at the sky,. ""I don't need love. though temptation is sweet. Give me your hand. 'Til I'm back on me feet. You're always telling me about my misery. I've seen things you'll never see. Don't pity me.. I'll be right again. Be upright without you. I'll stand up again. Kick up a fuss again too."". Cut back again to a girl walking by. Until the feet that are all shoes and no socks. Climb an invisible soap box. Laughing at the traffic. Shouting at the world:. ""I don't need love. though temptation is sweet. Give me your hand. 'Til I'm back on my feet. You're always telling me about my misery. I've seen things you'll never see. Don't pity me.. I'll stand up again. Kick up a fuss again too. I'll be right again. Be upright without you."". We see a life through the eyes of a man. As he live and he dies. By a simple tattoo. ""I'll be back again. When I land on my feet. I'll stand up again. Kick up a fuss again, wouldn't you?"". Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him. It's there on his face. He's a case where there's clearly no hope. ""Give me your hand again. 'Til I land again"". His face starts to fade. As we pull down the shade. And the picture we made. Is in glorious cinemascope."
bama lama bama loo,Bama Lama Bama Loo. Gotta girl named Lucinda. They call her the great pretender. Gotta girl named Lucinda. They call her the great pretender. And when she talks. She says a Bama Lama Loo. Chorus. Bama Lama Bama Loo. Bama Lama Bama Loo. Bama Lama Bama Loo. Bama Lama Bama Loo. Well I dig her style. She's bout to drive me wild. With Bama Lama Bama Loo. Well I asked my little baby for a kiss. She shook her head around like this. Well I asked my little girl for a kiss. She shook her head around like this. She said ..... (Chorus).
basement kiss,Lucy Grace can't show her face down in the North End Road. For in Belgravia. Rumours have been whispered and suggestions have been made. Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense?. You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense. You say you need the money. When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance. Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms. Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?. Only fingertips from forbidden bliss. Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?. Who's that sneaking 'round the door?. You can't come here no more. Can't you go home again?. She used to sit alone for hours. Spend her evenings watering dried flowers. When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed. Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head. She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead. Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat. It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that. She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes. Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom. And her ugly sister's tranquillizers. Why were you so tardy putting up your guard?. When you hurt so easily and you try so hard. Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms. Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?. Only fingertips from forbidden bliss. Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?
battered old bird,"The landlady's husband came up to town today. Since he left them both ten years ago to serve the ministry. The dark down road of his approach in constant rain was drenched. The tenant's boy said ""How d'ya do"" then swore in French. Did you teach this little child these curses on my soul. You should both be shut down in the coal-hole. That's the way to treat a child who cries out in the night. And a woman who teaches wrong from right. Chorus: He's a Battered Old Bird. And he's living up there. There's a place where time stands still. If you keep taking those little pink pills. ""Hush your mouth you hypocrite"". His humour cut her deep. The tight lipped leer of judgement. That had seen her love desert her just like sleep. ""Filthy words on children's lips are better, my dear spouse. Then if I were to speak my mind about this house"". Chorus. On the first floor there are two old maids. Each one wishing that the other was afraid. And next door to them is a man so mild. 'Til he chopped off the head of a visitor's child. He danced upon the bonfire. Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams. With a bottle of sweet sherry that everything redeems. Chorus. And on the second floor is the Macintosh Man. He's in his overcoats more than out of them. And the typewriter's rattling all through the night. He's burgundy for breakfast tight. He says ""One day I'll throw away all of my cares. And it is always Christmas in a cupboard at the top of the stairs"". Chorus. ""Well here's a boy if ever there was. Who's going to do big things. That's what they all say and that's how the trouble begins. I've seen them rise and fall. Been through their big deals and smalls. He'd better have a dream that goes beyond four walls"". You think he should be sent outside playing with the traffic. When pieces of him are already scattered in the attic."
beaten to the punch,You say that you can and then you run to get your mummy. And you're almost beaten to the punch. Looking for the man who sold you the dummy. And you're almost beaten to the punch. Laughing at the older guys who say it's just as well. Saved by the wedding bell. Almost beaten to the punch. You're looking for somebody new that you can knock around. You are almost beaten to the punch. If you've got a head for figures then you'd better count me out. You were almost beaten to the punch. You pulled the piece but you soon called it love. You go hand in glove. Almost beaten to the punch. Your body speaks much louder than your voice. You let it do the talking so I don't have any choice. Now you find the younger guys are putting up resistance. And you're almost beaten to the punch. You better get out now because you'll never go the distance. And you're almost beaten to the punch. You'll find a girl and you'll promise her anything. Even a wedding ring. Almost beaten to the punch. .
beautiful,"Every day is so wonderful. And suddenly, it's hard to breathe. Now and then, I get insecure. From all the pain, I'm so ashamed. I am beautiful no matter what they say. Words can't bring me down. I am beautiful in every single way. Yes, words can't bring me down. So don't you bring me down today. To all your friends, you're delirious. So consumed in all your doom. Trying hard to fill the emptiness. The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone. Is that the way it is?. 'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say. Words can't bring you down. 'Cause you are beautiful in every single way. Yes, words can't bring you down. So don't you bring me down today. No matter what we do. No matter what we say. We're the song inside the tune. Full of beautiful mistakes. And everywhere we go. The sun will always shine. But tomorrow we might awake. On the other side. On the other side. We are beautiful in every single way. Words won't bring us down. We are beautiful in every single way. Yes, words can't bring us down. So, don't you bring me down today. Don't you bring me down today"
bedlam,"I've got this phosphorescent portrait of gentle Jesus meek and mild. I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child. The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived. They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived. And they were surprised to see us. So they greeted us with palms. They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms. I might recite a small prayer. If I ever said them. I lay down on an iron frame. Found myself in bedlam. I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise. Wailing echoes down the corridors. I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial. I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye. And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme. Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams. Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi. For if I hold my hand outstretched. A little bird comes to me. I might recite a small prayer. If I ever said them. I lay down on an iron frame. Found myself in bedlam. Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars. Wailing echoes down the corridors. The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On"". Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem"". And in this pit of sadness. Where the rank of wretched plunge. We've buried all the innocents. Now we must bury revenge. They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a mustang. And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle. They dangled flags and other rags along a coloured thread of twine. And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine. Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces. Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces. Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance. Though I seemed a long way from my home. It really was no distance. And I might recite a small prayer. If I ever said them. I lay down on an iron frame. Found myself in bedlam. Bowing like an actor acknowledging applause. Playing the Crusader who was conquering the Moors. And he knew the consequences, but he won't accept the cause. Wailing echoes down the corridors"
beyond belief,History repeats the old conceits. The glib replies the same defeats. Keep your finger on important issues. With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues. I'm just the oily slick. On the windup world of the nervous tick. In a very fashionable hovel. I hang around dying to be tortured. You'll never be alone in the bone orchard. This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel. So in this almost empty gin palace. Through a two-way looking glass. You see your Alice. You know she has no sins. For all your jealousy. In a sense she still smiles very sweetly. Charged with insults and flattery. Her body moves with malice. Do you have to be so cruel to be callous. And now you find you fit this identikit completely. You say you have no secrets. And then leave discreetly. I might make it California's fault. Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault. Just like the canals of Mars and the great barrier reef. I come to you beyond belief. My hands were clammy and cunning. She's been suitably stunning. But I know there's not a hope in Hades. All the laddies cat call and wolf whistle. So-called gentlemen and ladies. Dog fight like rose and thistle. I've got a feeling. I'm going to get a lot of grief. Once this seemed so appealing. Now I am beyond belief.
big boys,"I am starting to function. In the usual way. Everything is so provocative. Very very, temporary. I shall walk (I shall walk). Out of this place (out of this place). I shall walk. Out on you. 'Cause you go silly. If she's willing. Trying so hard to be like the big boys. So you take her to the pictures. Trying to become a fixture. Inch by inch trying to reach her. All the way through the second feature. Worrying about your physical fitness. Tell me how you got this sickness, Oh ohhhh... I was caught in the suction. By a face like a truncheon. I was down upon one knee. Stroking her vanity. I was stuck on a hammerhead. I came alive and left for dead. As my face returned to red. Choking on my pride and pity. We can talk (we can talk). Until your face is blue ('til your face is blue). We can talk but she'll get to you. After you've been loved and hated. By the ones you've watched and waited. Found that they were overrated. She'll be the one - when the party's over. She'll be the one - when the girls have gone home. She'll be the one - that you'll wish you'd held onto. She'll be the one - but it's too late for you to. She'll be the one - who knows all your history. She'll be the one -. So you can cross her off your list. And you try so hard. And you try so hard. And you try so hard."
big sister,"Sheep to the slaughter. Oh, this must be love. All your sons and daughters in a strangle, all with a kid glove. Eyes like saucers; oh, you think she's a dish. She is the blue chip that belongs to the big fish. Big sister will be watching over you. Sister see, sister do. She's got to save me. She's got you playing Russian Roulette. Sport of kings, the old queen's heart. The prince of darkness stole some tart. It's in the papers, it's in the charts. It's in the stop press before it all starts. With a hammer and a slap 'n' tickle in inquisitive garments. With all the style and [finese] purchase of armaments. Compassion went out of fashion, that's all your concernment. Sweat it out for thirty seconds on all the prudeness. Big sister will be watching over you. Sister see, sister do. She's got to save me. She's got you playing Russian Roulette. She's got to save me."
big sister's clothes,"Sheep to the slaughter oh I thought this must be love. All your sons and daughters in a strangle hold with a kid glove. She's got eyes like saucers oh you think she's a dish. She is the blue chip that belongs to the big fish. Chorus:. But it's easier to say ""I love you,"". than ""Yours sincerly"" I suppose. All little sisters like to try on big sister's clothes. Big sister's clothes. The sport of kings, the old queen's heart. The prince in darkness stole some tart. And it's in the papers, it's in the charts. It's in the stop press before it all starts.. With a hammer on the slap and tickle under grisly garments. With all the style and finesse of the purchase of armaments. Compassion went out of fashion. That's all your concern meant. Sweat it out for thirty seconds on home improvements. Chorus."
big tears,"Everyone is busy with the regular routine. The sniper just takes his aim. Everyone is window shopping, no one is amazed. Even if he hit you, you'd still think it's just a graze. You go to a movie, you go to a show. You think that you're living, you don't really know. Big tears mean nothing. You can count them as they fall. Big tears mean nothing. When you're lying in your coffin. Tell me who's been taken in. Oh, you talk about the new boss automatic clause. But of course they make it all up for you. Always fascinated by the weird edge of town. Come home disappointed every time they put you down. Laughing with the old boys, saying that it's all noise. I suppose big tears mean nothing. You can count them as they fall. Big tears mean nothing. When you're lying in your coffin. Tell me who's been taken in. All the buttons of my overcoat. They have fallen off one by one. You wouldn't even like me if you'd never had a drink. You wouldn't even like me if you never stopped to think. Standing in the shadow, turning wives to widows. Don't you know big tears mean nothing. You can count them as they fall. Big tears mean nothing. When you're lying in your coffin. Tell me who's been taken in. Tell me, me or yous been taken in."
black and white world,I was looking at the black and white world. It seemed so exciting. If you'd only put me back to back with that girl. When the night's inviting. With just a little lighting. There'll never be days like that again. When I was just a boy and men were men. You never go from moment to moment. You're the living double of a single fiction. You're very colourful with your compliments. As you feel the finger's friction. It's a freeze-frame. Still it's real life. You don't want to look. Cause you've seen the film and you've read the book. I was looking at the black and white world. Trying to name some pin-up. Those days she was just a beautiful girl. Now she's framed and hung up. I thought she was young. Up until I saw her last night in close detail. Though they all fade away when you're so pale. It's more than just a physical attraction. It starts with a face and ends up a fixation. But you're never gonna feel a fraction. Of the way it used to work on your imagination. When you were looking at the black and white world.... .
black sails in the sunset,Vain boys are gonna have to swallow their pride this time. So let the punishment fit the crime. It's under the table. Under your skin. Into the cable. Is this the death of the glory you're in?. Chorus:. Black sails in the sunset. White noise going yakety-yak. All the money in the world will never bring your body back. Is it some mysterious dance nobody can do?. Thought I knew all the steps quite clearly. I don't have a clue. Oooh. You're Cinderella with a ball and chain. And the shoe seems to fit you. You tell the truth sometimes but. You wouldn't know it if it hit you. Is this some new trick. Wired up in your head?. Do you make me sick. Or was I just force fed?.
blame it on cain,"Once upon a time, I had a little money.. Government burglars took it long. before I could mail it to you.. Still, you are the only one.. Now I can't let it slip away.. So if the man with the ticker tape,. he tries to take it,. well this is what I'm gonna say.. Blame it on Cain.. Don't blame it on me.. Oh, oh, it's nobody's fault,. but we need somebody to burn.. Well if I was a saint with. a silver cup. and the money got low. we could always heat it up. or trade it in.. But then the radio TO heaven will be wired to your purse.. And then you can run down the wave band,. coast to coast, hand in hand.. Better or worse, curse for curse,. don't be dissatisfied.. So you're not satisfied.. . chorus. I think I've lived a little too long. on the outskirts of town. I think I'm going insane. from talking to myself for so long.. Oh but I've never been accused.. When they step on your face,. you wear that good look grin.. I gotta break out one weekend. if I do somebody in.. But every single time. I feel a little stronger,. they tell me it's a crime.. Well how much longer?. chorus."
blue chair,"Now it's just you and me, my blue friend. And you say that it's you that she's thinking of. And our affair must end. But if it's you that she's thinking of. I think my broken heart might mend. Chorus: Now it's my turn to talk and your turn to think. Your turn to buy and my turn to drink. Your turn to cry and my turn to sink down in the Blue Chair. Down in the Blue Chair. Now I've made up my mind I've made my mistake. And I know that she cries for you. When she's barely awake. Well she's going to bend your mind. Well I hope it don't break. Chorus. Down in the Blue Chair. We can watch our troubles rise. Like smoke into the air. And drift up to the ceiling. Down in the Blue Chair. You can feel just like a boy or a man. And next minute you can find yourself kneeling. Down in the Blue Chair. They're boasting of loving the daylights right out of her in the small hours. Down in the Blue Chair. You say that your love lasts forever when you know the night just hours. ANd still I want her right now. Not any minute, hour or day. And wherever she is tonight. I want her anyway. I suppose she never said to you,. You were just in the way. Chorus. Down in the Blue Chair. Down in the blue. Blue becomes you. Down in the Blue Chair."
boy with a problem,I feel like a boy with a problem. I can't believe what we've forgotten. And I even slapped your face and made you cry. It's the last thing I want to do. Pull the curtains on me and you. Pull the carpet from under love. Pull out like young lovers do. You swore you wouldn't shout. If it's not your punch then its your pout. Days in silence try my temper. Nights spent drinking to remember. How memories are always tender. I crept out last night behind your back. The little they know might be the pieces I lack. Came home drunk. Talking in circles. The spirit is willing but I don't believe in miracles. I've got a problem but let's go to bed. I can roll over and I can play dead. But here I am in the doghouse instead. I feel like a boy with a problem. I can't believe all you've forgotten. Sleeping with forgiveness in your heart for me.

bright blue times,"Alone in the crowd. Simply taking up space. You would never admit to tears. Till they're rolling down your face. Chorus:. One day, love, long from now. Maybe you'll leave that we. Live in bright blue times. Alone in the dark. There's a voice in your head. You would never admit your name. Could be someone else instead. Chorus."
brilliant disguise,"(Bruce Springsteen). I hold you in my arms. There's a band playing. What are those words whispered, baby. Just as you turn away?. Well I saw you last night. Out on the edge of town. I wanna read your mind and know just what I got in this. New thing I found. So tell me what I see. When I look into your eyes. Is that you, baby. Or just a brilliant disguise?. I heard someone call your name. Underneath my willow. I saw something tucked in shame. Underneath your pillow. Well I tried so hard, baby. But I just can't see. What a woman like you. Is doing with me. So tell me who I see. When I look into your eyes. Is that you, baby. Or just a brilliant disguise?. Now look at me, baby. Struggling to do everything right. And then it all falls apart. When out go the lights. I'm just a lonely pilgrim. I walk this world in wealth. I wanna know it's you I don't trust. 'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself. Now you play the lovin' woman. I play the faithful man. Just don't look too close. Into the palm of my hand. When we stood at the altar. The gypsy swore our future looked right. But in the wee, wee hours, maybe baby,. The gypsy lied. So when you look at me. You better look hard and look twice. Is that me, baby. Or just a brilliant disguise?. Tonight our bed is cold. I'm lost in the darkness of our love. God have mercy on a man. Who doubts what he's sure of."
brilliant mistake,"He thought he was the King of America. Where they pour Coca Cola just like vintage wine. Now I try hard not to become hysterical. But I'm not sure if I am laughing or crying. I wish that I could push a button. And talk in the past and not the present tense. And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear. Like it was common sense. It was a fine idea at the time. Now it's a brilliant mistake. She said that she was working for the ABC News. It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use. Her perfume was unspeakable. It lingered in the air. Like her artificial laughter. Her mementos of affairs. ""Oh"" I said ""I see you know him"". ""Isn't that very fortunate for you"". And she showed me his calling card. He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two. He was a fine idea at the time. Now he's a brilliant mistake. He thought he was the King of America. But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams. A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals. The words of love in whispers. And the acts of love in screams. I wish that I could push a button. And talk in the past and not the present tense. And watch this lovin' feeling disappear. Like it was common sense. I was a fine idea at the time."
broken,"If I am frightened then I can hide it. If I am crying, I'll call it laughter. If I am haunted, I'll call it my imaginary friend. If I am bleeding, I'll call it my wine. But if you leave me then I am broken. And if I'm broken then only death remains. If I am drifting, then I can fight it. If I am sinking, no-one will know it. If I am blinded I'll have my voices still to guide me. If they yet fled away I'd bless the silence. But if you leave me then I am broken."
brown to blue,"We stood there in the courthouse room so close but far apart. You brought along the lawyer and I brought a broken heart. The judge pronounced the words the way you wanted him to do. You changed your name from Brown to Jones and mine from Brown to Blue. I couldn't help my tears from falling on the courtroom floor. My love, they took away my right to love you anymore. My world just seemed to stop as I stood there so close to you. You changed your name from Brown to Jones and mine from Brown to Blue. The judge forgot to tell me how I'd live my life alone. What I would do without you after loving you so long. He didn't seem to care that I'm still in love with you. You changed your name from Brown to Jones and mine from Brown to Blue. I couldn't help my tears from falling on the courtroom floor. My love, they took away my right to love you anymore. My world just seemed to stop as I stood there so close to you. You changed your name from Brown to Jones and mine from Brown to Blue."
burnt sugar is so bitter,"She says what has her daddy done. That you want him to be punished. When she woke up one day to find. That he was starting to vanish. But _if you hope_ (?) to hear voices. You know you should not be listening. Push the vigilant lips. Make a slice of her face. Said the scandalous whispering. She's not on her own with the rest of her riches. As the kids paint him out of their refrigerator bitches. She picks up the bills and pays the babysitter. 'Cause everybody knows burnt sugar is so bitter. And once there was a time. Before you turned strange. She thought they'd be together. For more than a lifetime. Look at them now. My, how things have changed. He can tell his sweetheart. Out of any girl on just a whiff. And turn it from a candy to a caramel. And make her hate the silouette she used to feel. And say ""I know nothing about you."". Now what's left of the birthday cake. Smeared and beautifully frosted. An absent father picks up the phone. To find the number's unlisted. While the kids are distracted. She'll notice _she's nervous at all_ (?). But how long will it take. Not to make a mistake. When a gentleman comes to call. She's not on her own with the rest of her riches. As the kids tear down their refrigerator pictures. They already know how a woman may advance. From a pretty picture hat to a supermarket trance. Where it is unkind, she might as well forget it. 'Cause everybody knows burnt sugar is so bitter. Burnt sugar is so bitter. Burnt sugar. Burnt sugar. Burnt sugar. ."
busy bodies,"So you think that you have seen her. When you're lying in between her. And you tell me that you don't care. Busy bodies getting nowhere. Ev'rybody's getting meaner. Busy bodies. Caught in the concertina. You check her outline. Break her regulations. You watch her legs through several. Service stations. Busy bodies. Very busy. Getting nowhere. Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere. Now you're ready for the merger. With the company you're part of. And you do the dirty business. With your latest sleeping partner. You're becoming. Automatic. Busy bodies. Out playing with the traffic. You want attention. You try my patience. With the best intentions you are nothing but a nuisance. Busy bodies. Busy busy. Getting nowhere. Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere. Now you've given your performance. Though the matinee was idle. And you find that a wave of her right hand. Could seem so tidal. Just a second. Satisfaction. Busy bodies. Temporarily out of action. You wash and brush up. You want to dress up. You want to kiss her. But she's busy with her makeup. Busy bodies. Very busy. Getting nowhere. Nowhere (x6). ."

But you know I don't. Button my lip. 'Til I'm old enough. 'Til I'm smart enough. 'Til I'm?. Button my lip. Don't want to come at your beckoning. For any day they'll be a reckoning.

can you be true?,"Can you be true?. Can this possibly be real?. I knew quite suddenly. Do you sense how I feel?. I long to hear you whisper my name. 'Til you tell me. ""My Darling, you may be my man."". There will be days when you must go from my sight. There may be nights when clouds deny us starlight. Only time will tell us. I hope that it speaks gently if it isn't meant to be. Then again. By then we might not be listening so attentively. I will be there. If the days bring torments and trials. To close the distances only measured in miles. I long to hold you all through the night. And to tell you. ""My Darling, you make everything seem right"". And then I'll hear you calling in my name. And I'll answer."

charm school,Men made out of monkeys. Men made into mice. Happy days are here again. And all the drinks half price. A girl with a trick and a man with a calling. Trying to make a living out of your downfalling. TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING out of anything at all. Didn't they teach you anything except how to be cruel. In that charm school. You and I as lovers. Were nothing but a farce. TRYING TO MAKE A SILK PURSE. OUT OF A SOW'S ARSE. Saying 'Why don't you watch me'. Hardly speaking SOTTO VOCE. I've got a notion. I've got an angle. Take your dreams and promises. And put them through the mangle. They say it's hell to finance too. And I just want to romance you. In this perpetual nightclub. I'll be yours eternal. Though the hours are long. And the noise infernal. JUST ONE SHAMEFUL ACT OR SOMETIMES TWO. WE MAKE BELIEVE WE'RE MAKING DO.
cheap reward,"Oh, well, I feel so loose tonight I might fall to pieces. So be prepared to sweep me out the door. And I might be horizontal by the time the music ceases. So I think I'll get acquainted with the floor. Oh, I was trying to get away from the things that I always do. Hello, floorboards once again--how are you?. Lip Service--well, that's all you'll ever get from me. Well, how could you believe I'll take you seriously?. With your cheap rewards, your blackmail, and your comical rage. Just remember you'll only be the boss so long as you pay my wage. All the sign posts on this road that point one way. Don't act like you're above me, just look at your shoes. I'll turn the light out now 'cause there's nothing more to say. And it's all been lost before so there's nothing to lose. Oh, but you could say that you love me very painlessly. I would've done the same for you, oh, but you said to me:. Lip service--well, that's all you'll ever get from me. Well, how could you believe I'd take you seriously?. With your cheap rewards, your blackmail, and your comical rage. Just remember you'll only be the boss so long as you pay my wage."
chemistry class,"She throws back her hair [hands] and she shows you her mouth. The breath that I waste trying to ruin your life. Beauty's on a budget but you take it on the chin. 'Cause you have to do your duty taking orders from the kingpin. You've got a chemistry class I want a piece of your mind. You don't know what you started when you mixed it up with mine. Are you ready for the final solution? Oh. Oh.. [They] chopped you up in butcher's school. Threw you out of the academy of garbage. You'll be a joker all your life. A student at the comedy college. People pleasing people pleasing people like you. You've been around so long but you still don't know what to do. (Chorus). Sparks are flying from electrical pylons. Snakes and ladders running up and down her nylons. Ready to experiment, you're ready to be burned. If it wasn't for some accidents then some would never ever learn. (Chorus). ."
chewing gum,"With their cardboard hands by their sides,. here's a naked man and lady. And they're yours to cut out and keep. So you can dress them up maybe. They don't know just who they are, or who they're supposed to be. You can make them happy or sad. Or assume their identity. So here they are in the departure lounge. It's the ""Gateway to the East"". She is just another mail-order bride. She doesn't know he's a kinky beast. So he gives her a picture of Maradona and child. She wants to ""roll and rock"". As he spills his beer over her, bumps and he. grinds, as he repeats ""Bang-Cock"". Chorus:. There must be something that is better than this. It starts with a slap and ends up with a kiss. Begins with you bawling and it ends up in tears. Oh my little one, take that chewing gum out of your ears. She might as well be in the jungle. She might as well be on the moon. He's away on a business trip, in Dusseldorf, but she's becoming immune. To the lack of glamour and danger in a West-German city today. The nearest she comes to the ""Dynasty"" he promised her. Is a Chinese takeaway. Chorus. Though he only taught her three little words, it. doesn't matter if they're dirty or clean. He can only control what they look like. He can never possess what they mean. Now he wants to whisper in her ear. All the shrinking nothingness. But something always comes between them,. I wonder if you can guess. Chorus."
cinco minutos con vos,"I stood at the kerb trying not to disturb. The dark carnival crew and a glittering voice. Far off there said, ""Rejoice"". ""As the casualties are but few"". Going to tell you now. Before I forget myself. I could let you loose. But the key won't undo the lock. And the face of the clock. Seemed to merrily mock. These five minutes with you. Mi padre sabía. Y me lo susurro. Vete a Montevideo y espérame ahí. Por dónde empezar?. Escuchando siempre están. Por cinco minutos o mas. Si te atreves. La sirenas lamentan. La plaga que encuentran. Las balas caen. Y te harán desaparecer. El faro oscurece hay poca esperanza. Cinco minutos con vos. [English Version:]. My father would know. So he whispered it low. ""Go to Montevideo and wait for me there"". How can I begin?. They're always listening in. For five minutes or more if you dare. Now the sirens wail. There is a fever in the winding sheets. And the bullets hail. And they pull you right off the streets. Our chances are slim. but the searchlights will dim in five minutes for you. The propeller was droning, I woke up alone. They opened the door and they threw me through. And down I went down, like the twist of a screw. Down into the silver, above me the blue. And you stood there waiting but you never knew. Five Minutes With You. They can scatter the earth and find nothing of worth. Wipe out those years of triangular tears. The colours will fly. And the wild wind will cry I'm strapped to that mast. Knowing they wouldn't last for. Five Minutes With You"

Checking on a checkmate. Classing out a classmate. So beautiful and fortunate. He hates to love, you love to hate. He can fix you for good. 'Cause he is the neighborhood. You can't get money for blood. Blood money for doin' no good. But they won't take my love for tender. Payday's coming and we wash it away. Clean money, clean money. Payday's coming and we wash it away. Clean money, clean money. That's what I want to do. I want to spend it on you. Have you made your selection ?. Are you ready for correction ?.

clown strike,She'll fix you with an iron cross. And cover you up with petals. And hang you up with some amber beads. And four or five precious metals. And in that black flamingo chair. You'll sit among her trophies. And pray to be abandoned. Till you don't know what hope is. CHORUS:. But there's one thing that I had to keep inside. Because I was shaking. Why don't you get some pride. There was a clown strike. And the clowns threw down their tools. But you don't have to play so hard. And I'm nobody's fool. You don't have to go so far. 'Cause I love you as you are. The big top is deserted now. And the circus girl rehearses. She knows how to turn their heads. And not fall between two horses. But all that seems a simple step. If only I were able. To love you like I want to do. And not by some times table. CHORUS. And it's pandemonium. For the humble and the mighty. You don't have to tumble for me. Even a clown knows when to strike. Tell me what you want of me. Or are you terrified of failure?. You put on a superstitious face. Behind all this paraphernalia. We're not living in a masquerade. Where you only have three wishes. It isn't easy to see. In a lifetime of mistaken kisses. CHORUS. In this pandemonium. For the humble and the mighty. You don't have to tumble for me.

clubland,"With a handful of backhanders and a bevy of beauty. You're going off limits. Going off duty. Going off the rails. Going off with booty. They tell tales of fiction found on all the criminal types. Lead to a higher ranking man or a face with thin red stripes. Chorus:. The boys next door. The mums and dads. New weds and nearly-deads. Have you ever been had in Clubland?. There's a piece in someone's pocket to do the dirty work. You've come to shoot the pony. They've come to do the jerk. They leave him half way to paradise. They leave you half way to bliss. The ladies' invitation never seemed like this. Chorus. The long arm of the law slides up the outskirts of town. Meanwhile in Clubland they are ready to pull them down. Hey. The right to work is traded in for the right to refuse admission. Don't pass out now, there's no refund. (when) Did you find out what you were missing. The crowd is taking forty winks minus ten percent. You barely get required sleep to go lingering with contemptment. Thursday to Saturday. Money's gone already. Some things come in common these days. Your hands and work aren't steady. Chorus."
coal train robberies,"Yesterday's coal train came to rest in the bitter cutting. And as the signals took an age to change it was easy pickings. So you go to the movies where they smash it up. You want to feel your heart pumping it makes you feel good. All through the karaoke girls were squealing the hits. As another Mercedes-Benz gets blown to bits. While all the time in the camptown theatres of Piccadilly. They're going to throw a black-face minstrel show for the barefoot children. That they're always selling. They'll say ""It's quaint"" as the guilty ones faint and claim they ain't underneath this paint. We interrupt these liberal saints with their whips and watermelon. Reports are coming in of a coal-train robbery. It's like another world, or it had better be. So we return to whitewashed pout of his committed lips. Since he was declared the long lost fountain. of youth that drips and drips and drips. They'll be sending him round from door to door,. to sell you back what's already yours. ""So many good deeds, so little time"". Say the advertising agency swine. When man has destroyed what he thinks he owns. I hope no living thing cries over his bones. If you don't believe that I'm going for good. You can count the days I'm gone and chop up. the chairs for firewood. Reports are coming in of a coal-train robbery. It's like another world, or it had better be."
colour of the blues,"Up above me are the skies. Like the twinkle in your eyes. Blue must be the colour of the blues. In the mail, the letters came. But you can't pay for love the same. Blue must be the colour of the blues. The bluebird singin' in the trees. Seems to sympathize with me. 'Cause he's not singin' like he used to do. Pretty waters in the sea. Feel as cold as you left me. Blue must be the colour of the blues. Blue days come and blue days go. The way I feel, nobody knows. Life is finally empty without you. There's a blue note in each song. That I sing since you've been gone."
"come away, death","(Harle/Shakespeare). Come away, come away, death. And in sad Cyprus let me be laid. Fie away, fie away, breath. I am slain by a fair cruel maid. My shroud of white stuck all with you. O prepare it. My part of death no one so true. Did share it. Come away, come away, death. Not a flower, not a flower, sweet. On my black coffin let there be strewn. Not a friend, not a friend, greet. My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown. A thousand thousand sighs to say. Lay me over. Sad true lover never find my grave. To weep there. Come away, come away, death."

And said ""Let's go get stoned"". Will you be denying me?. Will you still come crying to me. Come The Meantimes. Are you still obeying me?. Will you still be praying to me?. Come The Meantimes. Will you sit in judgment then?. Be the first one to condemn. Come The Meantimes. Now you've got nobody else to blame. And trouble remembering my name. Will you still be cursing me. Come my anniversary. Come The Meantimes. He came back, (right back). And they followed and failed. He came back, (right back). He got hammered and nailed. He came back, (right back). And he wandered alone. They said let's gather some stones. And make them atone. Now I'm in a hall of mirrors. With my secret thoughts and terrors. Come The Meantimes. And I'm drinking to your health. Find I'm only talking to myself. Come The Meantimes. He came back, (right back). And nobody blinked. He came back, (right back). At least I think that he did. He came back, (right back).

complicated shadows,"Well you know your time has come. And you're sorry for what you've done. You should've never have been playing with a gun. In those Complicated Shadows. Well there's a line that you must toe. and it'll soon be time to go. but it's darker than you know in those Complicated Shadows. All you gangsters and rude clowns. Who were shooting up the town. When you should have found someone to put the blame on. Though the fury's hot and hard. I still see that cold graveyard. There's a solitary stone that's got your name on. You don't have to take it from me. But I know what I spake. You think you're like iron and steel. But iron and steel will bend and break. In those Complicated Shadows. Go!. Sometimes justice you will find. Is just dumb not colour-blind. And your poor shattered mind can't take it all in. All those phantoms and those shades. Should Jump up on Judgement Day. And say to the Almighty ""I'm still stinking of sin"". But the jury was dismissed. Took his neck and they give it a twist. So you see you won't be missed in those Complicated Shadows. You can say just what you like in a voice like a John Ford film. Take the law into your hands. You will soon get tired of killing. In those Complicated Shadows. Complicated Shadows. Complicated Shadows. Complicated Shadows"
couldn't call it unexpected no.4,"I saw a girl who'd found her consolation. She said ""One day my Prince of Peace will come"". Above her head a portrait of her father. The wilted favour that he gave her still fastened to the frame. ""They've got his bones and everything he owns. I've got his name"". Well you can laugh at this sentimental story. But in time you'll have to make amends. The sudden chill where lovers doubt their immortality. As the clouds cover the sky the evening ends. Describing a picture of eyes finally closing. As you sometimes glimpse terrible faces in the fire. We'll I'm the lucky goon. Who composed this tune. from birds arranged on the high wire. Who on earth is tapping at the window?. Does that face still linger at the pane?. I saw you shiver though the room was like a furnace. A shadow of regret across a young mother's face. So toll the bell or rock the cradle. Please don't let me fear anything I cannot explain."
couldn't you keep that to yourself,The tiny slip at midnight. A little sip at noon. You're tired and torn approaching dawn. My penitent buffoon. Wouldn't you think I'd know by now. I shouldn't have entertained it. Couldn't you keep that to yourself. You cried for my forgiveness. You say it sets you free. You summon dear the shameful tears. That spill all over me. Wouldn't you think I'd know by now. I shouldn't have entertained it. Couldn't you keep that to yourself. The penny rides at evening tide. The vain requests. The blush of the night. And the blooming bush. Where you failed every test. What should I believe of you?. What should I forget. Am I innocent yet. Is it the wife you would have beaten. Is it the child you couldn't bear?. I fear you have mistaken me. For somebody who cares. The sophisticated victim. That you skilfully request. You can hide behind your wishes. You can hide behind despair. And all the wretched syndroms. That carry away the blame. Couldn't you keep you keep that to yourself. And wouldn't you shouldn't you couldn't you. Keep that to yourself
country darkness,"This tattered document. A mystery you can solve. Some burnt out filament. Flies still buzzing around the bulb. Country Darkness. He thought of traveling. Heard an approaching train. Drown out his desperate pulse. A song with no refrain. Country Darkness. She daydreams of forbidden sins. There must be something more. The prison she lives in. The one with the open door. The veil is covering. A glistening and cruel blade. Suffer little children. Repent, unfaithful maid. Country Darkness"
crawling to the u.s.a.,"I thought I would go to the sea and shrink down very tiny. And slide inside the telephone wire that runs under the briny. Till I found there is a way of crawling to the U.S.A.. You had better not go too far. There's one way out, there's only one way. Leave your mother and your father. Crawling to the U.S.A.. Saw it late one night on a secret channel. It's farther on along the tunnel. It's way beyond the final station. That's the one they never mention. You had better not go too far. There's one way out, there's only one way. Leave your mother and your father. Crawling to the U.S.A.. You don't have to pay them that much. You had better bring your lunch. It's undercover, around the houses. Up your skirt and down your trousers. You had better not go too far. There's one way out, there's only one way. Leave your mother and your father. Crawling to the U.S.A.. She said, ""I catch you taking liberties and they do not impress me. Attach me to your credit card and then you can undress me. Everybody is on their knees except the Russians and the Chinese. You had better not go too far. There's one way out, there's only one way. Leave your mother and your father."
crimes of paris,"I thought it was you and your optimist's view of the clock. And how it's always another day. Just after twelve o'clock's struck. You said ""Now I only want you so I don't have to promise"". But tiny children in grown-up clothes whispered all the Crimes of Paris. Chorus: You're not the girl next-door or a girl from France. Or the cigarette-girl in the sizzle hot-pants. All the words of love seem cruel and crass. When you're tough and transparent as armoured glass. You're everywhere girl in an everyday mess. Who'll pay for the Crimes of Paris. I heard that you fell for the ""Hell or to Hammersmith Blues"". In the tiny torn up pieces of his mind he's irresistible too. Now it's hard to say now if he's only stupid or smart. When he crawled through the door. And poured out more of his creeping-Jesus heart. Chorus. And it's all here and now. She hit him with that paper-weight Eiffel Tower. And I tried to hold on to you but I don't know how. And I find it hard to swallow good advice. Like going down three times to only come up twice. She's so convenient, he's always stiff as hair-lacquer. It's hard to discover now he's in love with her. It was her way of getting her own back. You never did anything she couldn't do on her own. You're as good as your word and that's no good to her. You'd better leave that kitten alone. Chorus."
"cry, cry, cry","Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down. They say you only live to see the lights of town. I wasted my time when I would try, try, try. 'Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry. Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone. And you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone. You'll come to me but I'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye. When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry. You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone. When everyone's forgotten and you're on your own. You're gonna cry, cry, cry. I lie awake at night and wait till you come in. You stay a little while and then you're gone again. Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie. For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry. When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you. You'll come back to me for a little love that's true. I'll tell you no and you're gonna ask me why, why, why. When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry. You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there. It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been. You're gonna cry, cry, cry."
daddy can i turn this?,"There is a button and there's a switch. There is a needle and there's a dial. There is a lever I want to lift. And still you treat me like I'm a child. Daddy can I turn this?. Daddy can I turn this?. Will it be very dangerous?. Or will it taste nice?. You wash your hands with perfume and spice. I'll tell you when I want your advise. Daddy can I turn this?. Daddy can I turn this?. Is anybody acting your age?. You got a girl you keep in a cage. You give her presents after a while. A birthday cake containing a file. Daddy can I turn this?. Daddy can I turn this?. The flashing lights go running 'round and 'round. It spits out money. It tastes like honey. So drink it down. It leaves the slightest chemical taste. It could be most unfortunate. Earrings that jangle before they're seen. She slaps your face like a tambourine. Daddy can I turn this?. Daddy can I turn this?. Daddy can I turn this?. Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy...."
damnation's cellar,"Did anybody notice, over marmalade and eggs. In between the Princess' legs. What with wars and floods and beggars. Not to mention stocks and shares. If you have a moment to spare. Can you write and reassure me that I have seen. They're constructing a time machine. There will be no need for the obituary pages. We can have any hero from the bygone ages. 'Til the truth emerges, the argument rages. Chorus:. The major and the minor. Turn from tallow into tar. Should we leave them in their place?. Down in damnation's cellar. When any form of deity that you might enjoy. Can be conjured with a test-tube and a flame. If it's out there then science can explain it. Or at least remove the blame. And if theres is anyone you'd like to see again. The speak up quickly. Send us back Da Vinci then we don't have to ponder. The maddening smile of ""La Giaconda"". The critics say Nijinsky, the dancer, of course. While the punters would probably prefer the horse. You'll find it's quicker than history, cheaper than divorce. Chorus. Bring back Liberace or Ollie and Stan. Shakespeare will have to wait his turn. Elvis Presley and Puccini shall return. I suppose we live and learn, though it's hard to believe as we. cheerfully burn. It's curious. Some will call for justice.. There are murders to solve. What about Hitler? Or at least Lee Harvey Oswald. Give us this day and everything we squander. Anyone beautiful. Somebody blonder. They'll never please mankind, so lie back and enjoy it. Stop press: They've just decided to destroy it."
dancing in the moonlight,"We get it on most every night. When that old moon gets so big and bright. It's a supernatural delight. Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight.

Everybody's feelin' warm and right. It's such a fine and natural sight. Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight. We like our fun and we never fight. You can't dance and stay uptight.

"darling,you know i wouldn't lie","Here I am late again for the last time. And like I promised, I just told her goodbye. Please believe me 'cause this time, it's really over. And darling, you know I wouldn't lie. Didn't I come and tell you about her. How temptation lured she and I. Now I know it was only fascination. And darling, you know I wouldn't lie. I had to let her down easy as slow as I could. After all, she's got feelings too. But it took a little longer than I thought it would. But this time, she knows we're really through. She wanted to hold me forever. And this lipstick shows her final try. And these tears on my shoulder are proof that she failed. And darling, you know I wouldn't lie."

dear sweet filthy world,"Dear sweet filthy world, my wife or whoever reads this. I think that I've lived too long. With all of my promise unfulfilled. But there is a veil drawn over all of that. I know you'll probably say, ""Spare us the melodrama"". ""I don't know how he chose the pills or the stupid revolver"". I'm out of luck. I'm not that strong. My hands, your neck. I might have wrung. Don't try to find me. I'm not worth anything anymore. I am not leaving you with all of your problems. The biggest one is me. Life is dark. Cold as the sea. Embrace me in my anguish. Put seaweed in my hair and vow that you won't cry because. I've gone. I can't go on, I can't go on, I can't go on."
deep dark truthful mirror,"One day you're going to have to face. A deep dark truthful mirror. And it's going to tell you things that I still love you too much to say. The sky was just a purple bruise, the ground was iron. And you fell all around the town until you looked the same. Chorus:. The same eyes, the same lips, the same lie from. your tongue trips. Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror. Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror. Now the flagstone streets where the newspaper shouts ring to the boots of roustabouts. But you're never in any doubt, there's something happening somewhere. You chase down the road 'til your fingers bleed. On a fiberglass tumbleweed. You can blow around the town, but it all shuts down the same. Chorus. So you bay for the boy in the tiger-skin trunks. They set him up, set him up on the stool. He falls down, falls down like a drunk. And you drink 'til you drool. And it's his story you'll flatter. You'll stretch him out like a saint. But the canvas that he splattered will be the. picture that you never paint. Chorus. A stripping puppet on a liquid stick gets into it pretty thick. A butterfly drinks a turtle's tears, but how do you know he really needs it?. 'Cos a butterfly feeds on a dead monkey's hand,. Jesus wept he felt abandoned. You're spellbound baby there's no doubting that. Did you ever see a stare like a Persian cat?."
deep dead blue,Deep dead blue. Deep dead blue. Deep dead blue that nightly shades. I'm lost in deep dead blue. Deep dead blue.
different finger,Please put your rings on a diff'rent finger if you meet me tonight. 'Cause I can't stand those suspicious glances. 'Cause I know the things they're saying are right. They're saying why don't you straighten up. And see what you've got to lose. Put it all down to fate but you still got the chance to choose. I don't want to hear your whole life story. Or about my strange resemblance to some old flame. All I want is one night of glory. I don't even know your second name. Please put your rings on a diff'rent finger 'cause we've got so much at stake. I can't stand those suspicious glances. 'Cause they seem to cover ev'ry move I make. But if I can be alone with you completely tonight. Put your rings on a diff'rent finger. Before I turn out the light
dirty rotten shame,"I recall the good old days. But thankfully, they've gone. Now the ponies all are broken nags. That stumble as they groan. And throw the jockeys from their throne. When there are pitches left to dodge. And lions left to tame. But it's nothing but a dirty rotten shame. It's a dirty rotten shame. That when you're frivolous and strong. It isn't youth, its fearlessness. That has been wasted on the young. The cruel are in the cradle. And the bishop's in the bag. It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame. Now I find life a millionaire. That brags for rags and jewels. A snarling pup is wild enough. But as his anger proves. He's left to sharpen useless tools. That tear and graze and finer phrase. But few are worth the name. It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame. It's a dirty rotten shame. And that is not an idle boast. When all your courage and your strength. Will leave you as you need it most. When there are lamps to dampen. And cauliflowers to flip. It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame."
dishonor the stars,"If you wake and chance to look. Above you. There's one that I named to show how. Much I love you. Hanging up high. Poets long have written and. Have sung. Of moonlight and some. Distant satellite. And when we're young we wish. Upon them. Other men may only dream. To kiss you. But it's not a thrill like this. Put your lips a little closer to my. Cheek then whisper, then speak. So, tell me if you know. How deep can this thing go?. Honey will still desire the flowers. And there will be a love like ours. Until the sky dishonours the stars. What in the world would all this. Amount to?. If I can't tell you how much. I want you. On such a night the sky might. Dishonour the stars. Disown and dishonour the stars. Poets long have written and. Have sung. Of moonlight and some. Distant satellite. And when we're young we wish. Upon them. Other men may only dream. To kiss you. But it's not a thrill like this. Put your lips a little closer to my. Cheek then whisper, then speak. So, tell me if you know. How deep can this thing go?. Honey will still desire the flowers. And there will be a love like ours.

dissolve,"Sugar cube drop into a yellow cup. What makes the world just waking up. Resolve?. Dissolve. Who knows where on earth it's going to stop?. I can't hear you 'cos we're breaking up. Dissolve. And the stones in the track make work for the mechanic. The birds all fly from the branches in a panic. And a back-fire echoes down the hillside. As the last headline report dies. Dissolve. Ice is melting at the distant Pole. The gin and tonic glasses overflow. Dissolve. The precious little else that I could say. Yor stupid tears of laughter washed away. Dissolve. While the poisonous light pours from the picture palace. And it flickers on, tries so hard to be scandalous. A child keeps beating on a toy drum. And the tablets dropped on your tongue. Dissolve. ""So salute me in moving frame"". ""I might not be there when you look again"". The mourning border card behind the clock. The hour that he passed, unwound and stopped."
distorted angel,"Strange things seem to occur, somewhere behind the nursery door. Though I was just a bit of a kid, it was the bit that she was looking for. Now I don't know where to begin confessing. The way she's making me feel it can't be a sin. I was taught to believe you were looking down on everyone. And your benevolent face is beautiful to gaze upon. Now I just don't know who to tell to go to hell. Who put the old devil in the distorted angel?. Distorted Angel. Pure illuminated sweetness. Frightening small children is just about your only weakness. I thought that you would tell me what I'm living for. But I can't see you anymore. I don't know what we did but I'm sorry if it made you cry. And if there's any justice at all I'd be punished for it I'd surmise. It will mark the spot very well where I fell. Under the shadow of the distorted angel. Beneath the shadow of the distorted angel. Below the shadow of the distorted angel. Angel. Beneath the shadow of the distorted angel. Below the shadow of the distorted angel. Angel."
don't be careless love,"(McCartney/MacManus). Burn the midnight lamp. Down until the dawn. I'll keep watch. Until I'm sure you're coming home. Shadows play. And flicker on the bedroom wall. They turn into a bad dream overnight. Something could be terribly wrong. Don't be careless love. Don't be careless love. Don't be, don't be careless. In my dream you're running nowhere. Every step you've taken turns to glue. Walking down a spiral staircase. Failing through, failing through. Don't be careless love. Be careless love. The lamp burns down and out. I'm getting pretty tired of this. I feel so bad. Something might be going amiss. I won't be there. So look out for yourself. You're getting in deep whatever you do. Don't let me go back to sleep. Don't be careless love. Don't be careless love. Don't be, don't be careless. Saw your face in the morning paper. Saw your body rolled up in a rug. Chopped up into two little pieces. By some thug. Don't be careless love. Be careless love. But in the morning light. When I wake up again. You're by my side. And that's the way it's always been. But in the dark. Your mind plays funny tricks on you. Your mind plays funny tricks on you. Your mind plays funny tricks on you. Don't be careless love."
don't let me be misunderstood,"B.Benjamin/S.Marcus/C.Cadwell. Baby can you understand me now. Sometimes I feel a little mad. Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel. When things go wrong I seem to be mad. (Chorus). I'm just a soul whose intentions are good. Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood. Baby sometimes I'm so carefree. With a joy that's hard to hide. Other times it seems that all I have to do is worry. And then I know you're bound to see my other side. Chorus. If I get mad at you I want you to know. That I never mean to take it out on you. Life has its problems and I get my share. But that is one thing I would never do 'cause I love you. Oh don't you know I'm human. I've got my faults just like any one. Sometimes I lie awake long regretting. Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done."
don't look now,"Don't look now, don't you dare. I'm not decent, go sit over there. Would you rather I was draped in priceless fur?. 'Cause there's nothing else to wear. Don't look now. I saw you shoot that glance. I said don't peek. At the sway of my dance. And the length of my limb. And the brush of my cheek. Okay, look at me now. What do you see?. I see you looking at me. Looking at how you looking at me. Oh, oh, oh. I know what you're thinking. I can read your mind. Oh, I promise, I'll be good this time. Now I wonder what you see. Will you be thinking of me?. Later on, when you're alone. Are you ever alone in longing?. I'll sit here silent and still. See if I'm breaking your will. I see you looking at me. Looking at how you looking at me. Oh, don't look at me now"
dr. luther's assistant,"Everything seems so tranquil. Home movies with no subtitles. Don't you wish you knew what they were sayin'. When the film keeps playin', playin' ?. Oh, he's Doctor Luther's assistant. He'll close in when he seems so distant. Doctor Luther's assistant. He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance. Some say he is just a lackey. Changing words while the ink is still tacky. He's absolutely indispensable. He keeps the other boys in suspense. Oh, he's Doctor Luther's assistant. He'll close in when he seems so distant. Doctor Luther's assistant. He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance. Luther is locked in a broken-down cinema. Watches his wife with his video camera. Sees his best boy makin' her grin. Out of the kitchen, she's gone with the wind. Oh, Doctor Luther's assistant. He'll close in, when he seems so distant. Doctor Luther's assistant."
dust 2...,"If dust could only talk. What would we hear it say?. Before it's brushed aside. Just as it's swept away. It's just the evidence. It's of no consequence. It's only flesh and bone. Why don't you leave it alone?. If dust could only speak. Caught in a falling beam. If dust could only cry. If dust could only scream. For it's the single witness that might testify. Could I spit out the truth?. Or would you ather just swallow a lie?. But dust is always caught behind a coat of paint. Beneath the marble fingernails of kings and saints. And in the theatre curtain where they hang a drape. Or in the ticket pocket where your hands escape. Before they start to wander. Or they start to shrink. You rub your eye a little and appear to blink. And then she caught you staring. She knows just what you're thinking. What got into you was not a ghost as such. It was just dust. Here comes the juggernaut. Here come The Poisoners. They choke the life and land. And rob the joy from us. Why do they taste of sugar. Oh, when they're made of money. Here comes the lamb of God. And the butcher's boy, Sonny. Well I believe we just."
edith and the kingpin,"The big man arrives. Disco dancers greet him. Plainclothes cops greet him. Small town, big man. Fresh lipstick glistening. Sophomore jive. From victims. Of typewriters. The band sounds. Like typewriters. The big man. He's not listening. His eyes hold edith. His left hand holds. His right. What does that hand desire. That he grips it so tight. Edith in the ring. The passed-over girls. Are conferring. The man. With the diamond ring. Is purring. All claws for now withdrawn. One by one they bring. His renegade stories to her. His crimes. And his glories to her. In challenge they look on. Women he has wanted grow. Old too soon. He tilts. Their tired faces. Gently to the spoon. Edith in his bed. A plane in the rain. Is humming. The wires in the walls. Are humming. Some song-some. Mysterious song. Bars in her head. Beating frantic. And snowblind. Romantic and snowblind. She says-his. Crime belongs. Edith and the kingpin. Each with charm to sway. Are staring eye to eye. They dare not look away. You know they dare. Not look away"
eisenhower blues,"Hey everybody I'm a talking to you. I ain't telling you jealous. It's just the natural truth. Oh oh oh I got the Eisenhower Blues. Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?. My money's gone, the fun is gone. The way things look I can't be here long. Oh oh oh I got the Eisenhower Blues. Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?. Taking all my money to pay the tax. I'm telling you people the natural facts. I'm telling you people, in my belief. I am headed straight on relief. Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues. Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?. I ain't got a dime, ain't got a cent. Ain't got no money to pay my rent. She wants some clothes, she wants some shoes. I'm telling you people I don't know what to do. Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues. Talking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?. Taking all my money to pay the tax. I'm telling you people the natural facts. I'm telling you people, in my belief. I am headed straight on relief. Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues. Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?. Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues."
either side of the same town,"Nothing can ever be the same. All of the promises we made seem hollow. But there's still some streets in this town. Oh, they're marked, they're marked with your shadow. So if you see me, look surprised. Well, well, well, if you don't. Oh, just pass me by. And I may, I may even brush your sleeve. Oh, as you turn around, turn around and leave. Now it's hard to act like strangers. When we used to be so strong. Everything is changing. And most of it is wrong. What do we know of anything. Two fools of some renown. Either side, either side of the same town. Somewhere there's a light. Oh, I can sense it. Though I may fall back again. Oh, I know, yes, I know it's a fight. Oh, but I must, Lord, I must. Withstand the strain. Now it's hard to keep ignoring. Someone you recognise. And if I seem contented. Well, that's only my disguise. What do we know of anything. Two fools of some renown. Either side, either side of the same town. Oh, yeah, either side, either side of the same town"
episode of blonde,"I spy for the ""Spirit of Curiousity"". All the scandals of each vain monstrosity. I gossip and I pry and I insinuate. If the failure is great. Then it tends to fascinate. A tornado dropped a funnel cloud with twenty tons of rain. Though she had the attention span of warm cellophane. Her lovers fell like skittles in a 10-pin bowling lane. But nothing could compare with that explosion of fame. So you jumped back with alarm. Every Elvis has his army. Every rattlesnake its charm. Can you still hear me?. Am I coming through just fine?. Your memory was buried in a simple box of pine. Did her green eyes seduce you and make you get so weak?. Was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?. It's such a shame you had to break the heart. You could have counted onbut the last thing you need is another. ...Episode of blonde. Revolving like a jeweller's figure on a music box. Spangled curtain parted and a night-club scene unlocks. Pinned and fixed and fastened in a follow spot. Arms thrown out to everyone, she's giving all she's got. To the last gasp of a wounded bandeon. Tiny man imploring to the cieling fan. This stolen feeling. Amplified up through a busted speaker. Blaring, blasting, advertising, distorted beyond reason. Into the street where petty crime-coats shadow panic drunkards,. Half out of the taxi cab the barker seized my elbow. He thought I was another lonely, likely pilgrim looking for St.Telmo. Repeat chorus. I tried to keep a straight face but you know it never pays. He would stare into those eyes and then vacation in her gaze. She was a cute little ruin that he pulled out of the rubble. Noe they are both living in a soft soap bubble. The film producer's contemplating, entertaining suicide. The picture crumpled in his fist, his runaway child bride. The timepiece stretched across a wrist. She couldn't care less cast aside. The scent that so repelled him that he swore: ""insecticide"". And there's a farewell note to mother. That will conclude ""Your loving Son"". ""Oh, tell your other children not to do as I have done."". Chorus. So an artist drags a toothbrush across the first thing that he sees. And names the painting ""Christ's Last Exit into Purgatory"". Receiving secret messages from an alien intelligence. Paying off his stalker it's a legitimate expense. So paste up pictures of those shrill and hollow girls. With puckered lips. She's a trophy on your arm. A magnet for your money clip. The moral of this story is the sorry tale to say."
everybody's crying mercy,I can't believe the things I've seen. I wonder bout some things I've heard. Everybody's crying mercy. When they don't know the meaning of the word. A bad enough situation. Is sure enough getting worse. Everybody's crying justice. Just as long as there's business first. Toe to toe. Touch and go. Give a cheer. Get your souvenier. People running round in circles. Don't know what they're headed for. Everybody's crying peace on Earth. Just as soon as we win this war. Straight ahead. Knock em dead. Pack your kid. Choose your hypocrite. Well you don't have to go to off broadway. To see something played absurd. Everybody's crying mercy. When they don't know the meaning of the word. Nobody knows the meaning of the word. When they don't know the meaning of the word. Nobody knows the meaning of the word.
everyday i write the book,"Don't tell me you don't know what love is. When you're old enough to know better. When you find strange hands in your sweater.

expert rites,"I marvel at the wonder of it in our souless age. Fast flow the tears upon the page. Don't be alarmed I am her friend. Will I be excused if I presume. It's more than disappointment that we share. You share the same sorry life, the families fight,. that unhappy blade you both invite. This romantic ideal has a lonely appeal. I once loved someone the way that you do. But I had to let her go. I live with my regret."
fallen,"All the leaves are turning yellow, red and brown. Soon they'll be scattered as they tumble down. Although they may be swept up so invitingly. I never did what I was told. I trampled though the amber and the burnished gold. But now I clearly see how cruel the young can be. You can convince yourself of anything. If you wish both hard and long. And I believed that life was wonderful. Right up to the moment when love went wrong. I gaze up at the tree-tops and laugh. I need somebody to shake me loose. I want to know what happens next. 'Til I don't care at all. There I go."
favourite hour,"Figure hanging on a leather band. Cog consults the watch he cups in his hand. Bejewelled movement measures lost and vanished time. Pray for the boy who makes his bed in cold earth and quicklime. CHORUS:. So stay the hands, arrest the time. 'Till I am captured by your touch. Blessings I don't count. Small mercies and such. The flags may lower as we approach the favourite hour. Now there's a tragic waste of brutal youth. Strip and polish this unvarnished truth. The tricky door that gapes beneath the ragged noose. The crippled verdict begs again for the lamest excuse. CHORUS. Pull out my eyes so I may never spy. Waving branches as they're waving goodbye. Their vile perfume brings to my mouth a bitter taste. The murmuring brooks had best speak up, it's a terrible waste. CHORUS."
fire suite 1,I remember that dance. On the roof of my car. When St. Lucy's mad torch. Took away our best bar. Say we drank. And we prayed. Some just sat like a choir. Came the smoke. In the night. Came the heat. Came the fire. Ember glow lagered ash. I was pissed as a fart. Stricken some dumb plum numb. We was broken at heart. Say we drank. And we prayed. Some just sat like a choir. Came the smoke. In the night. Came the light. Came the fire
fire suite 3,That all could gather. That we could marry. Still. Faces absent. That she could see this. As if time hovered. That he'd caress him. That jars and lads and Carol Ann were. Shouts from brilliant corners. Word 'n tears confused. Sparks long sky bound. Long sky bound. Had I been wiser. And not so bleedin'. Still geezer poet. Wine cross the lips flow. Love through eyes goes. That he'd embrace him. That jars and lads and Carol Ann were. That all could gather. That we could marry. Still. Faces absent. That she could see this. As if time hovered. That he'd caress him. That jars and lads and Carol Ann were. Set by the bar so tender
fire suite reprise,Now you've heard our refrain. And this story must end. 'Cause the stars can't stay up. They can only descend. Say we drank. And we prayed. Some just sit like a choir.

fish 'n' chip paper,"When Sunday morning dandruff turns out to be confetti. And the cost of living in sin would make a poor man out of Paul Getty. The girl in your dreams would have you up on an under age charge. And the man of the moment is the lifer at large. Chorus:. If you've got something to hide, if you've got something to sell. If you've got somebody's pride she might kiss and tell. Or wind up with a fight fan in the Hammersmith Hotel. You better speak up now if you want your piece. You better speak up now. It won't mean a thing later. Yesterday's news is tomorrow's fish and chip paper. Your girl says she's leaving and this time she really means it. You can just look at the pictures, you don't actually have to read it. Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. There's a man in the launderette and he's looking through your underwear. for clues. And the milkman is working through the News of the Screws. He says.... Chorus."
for other eyes,"I don't know what I would do. If this letter should fall into. Other hands than it should pass through. For other eyes. He said, ""It was nothing...it's over and done"". But the rotten worm was burrowing still. Its spirit invades me bleeding me white. For other replies. I searched his pockets. I searched his eyes. I searched his wallet for clues and lies. And I found a number that I somehow dialed. A woman answered, a woman smiled. Then she hung up on the silence unperplexed. Innocently spun her rolodex. I dialed again I could not resist. Revealing just the dentist receptionist. One day we'll laugh about it or maybe we'll curse. But there is one thing that is making it worse. And it's the lack of forgiveness that I can't disguise. No matter how well he lies. Now we don't know each other anymore. And when we touch our lips feel sore. I question the longing left in his sighs."
for the stars,"The stars were so much brighter then,. they dim and die. So why pretend. the sky goes on forever.. But if they fade as science teaches,. Poets lose the power of speech. waste paper, ink and feather. If I'd taken up the trumpet. as I should have done. Then I wouldn't be. always losing sleep. while I'm trying to make this rhyme. For the stars were so much. they were so much brighter then. If I couldn't put a price on your head. What's the use of me trying. for the stars?. The morning comes. the days are just the time between. until the dusk. when we can be together. If I'd taken up the drums. and I could play in time.. If I had the power. Would I be wondering how. I'm ever going to be write this down.. For the stars wree so much. They were so much brighter then. If I couldn't put a price on your head. Then what's the use of me trying. for the stars?."
forgive her anything,"(Written by Elvis Costello, Transcribed by Craig Ciccone w/ Bolan's Corrections). Oh, a TV went off like three day old milk. That shook this town down better than most. And it always was less of idea and more of a boast. Oh, you're burning in the bloom of life. 'Til you're powder in the grave. Or you're pounding in the counter beggin' for more. 'Til you evaporate. . You'd forgive her anything. If you look like you, my pretty Miss. I wonder where you are tonight. And this place becomes pityless. . Oh, I couldn't sleep, but I can't complain. Oh, this won't hurt a bit, oh, this won't hurt again. When the roof comes down and the walls move in. Oh, he didn't know it could feel like that. And your face turned away and the day turned black. And the rain fell like a curtain. Oh, it's my turn to begin. To forgive her anything. . You'd forgive her anything. If you knew what I know. You'd forgive her anything. So where did all my pride go?. . Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. . Oh, oh, oh, oh, you'd forgive her anything. If you knew what I know. You'd forgive her anything. So where did all my pride go?."
forty-five,"Bells are chiming for victory. There's a page back in history - 45. They came back to the world that they fought for. Didn't turn out just like they thought - 45. Here is a song to sing to do the measuring. What did you lose, what did you gain, what did you win?. Nine years later a child is born. There's a record so you put it on - 45. Nine years more if we're lucky now. Nine year old puts his money down - 45. Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat. Every breath that I held for you - 45. There's a stack of shellac and vinyl. Which is yours now or which is mine? - 45. Here is a song to sing to do the measuring. What did you lose, what did you gain, what did you win?. Bass and treble heal every hurt. There's a rebel in a nylon shirt. But the words are a mystery I've heard. Till you turn it down to thirty-three and a third. 'Cause it helps with the elocution. Corporations turn revolutions - 45. I heard something peculiar said. ""Perhaps he's got a shot"" and ""Now he's dead"" - 45. So don't you weep and shed(?). Just change my name instead. But what do you lose when it all goes to your head?. Bells are chiming and tears are falling. It creeps up on you without a warning - 45. Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat. Every breath that I've blessed. I'll be lost I confess - 45 45 45."
from a whisper to a scream,Oh it's not easy to resist temptation. Walking around looking like a figment of somebody else's imagination. Taking ev'ry word she says just like an open invitation. But the power of persuasion is no match for anticipation. Chorus:. Like a finger running down a seam. From a whisper to a scream. So I whisper and I scream. But don't get me wrong. Please don't leave me waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Waitin' too long. Hey. Oh oh oh oh oh. Oh if the customers like it then they'll keep on paying. If they keep on drinking then they'll end up staying. I heard someone say where have we met before. But the one over the eight seem less like one or more like four. Chorus.
from head to toe,"Oh, well, now you're the girl I'm simply mad about.. Oh yes, I'm really glad it's been me. Oh yeah.. I hope that you've been getting ready,. 'Cause I'm gonna ask you to go steady with me.. I got two eyes that happened by ya,. And when they saw you, they said they knew you were fine.. I got two lips that long to kiss you,. And when they speak, they say they wish you were mine.. Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.. Oh, I got a little heart inside me beating. And when it speaks it keeps repeating your name all the time.. You better watch out 'cause of what I say. Cause baby, don't you know that I ain't playing a game?. Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.. All the way down from the top to the ground, sweet baby.. I got two legs and I got two feet that always take me to your street. Everyday, all the time.. No matter which way I try to go, my legs and my feet. They seem to know the way.. Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.. All the way down from the top to the ground. Hey, sweet baby.."
georgie and her rival,"Georgie grew to hate her name. It sounded like a tiny man. And the one she had said ""I can't see you, but I'll call you whenever I can"". Sometimes the phone would ring, when she was half-asleep. A voice would drag her down with its suggestions. Though she often felt cheated, she never felt cheap. CHORUS. Well heaven knows what fills the heart and makes you feel so alive. It's impossible to tear apart. Georgie and her rival. It was half-past February. And he hadn't called since New Year's Day. Maybe he'd found another woman to say those words no chapel girl should say. Her mother would phone and always keep talking. She'd try to be polite, making faces. But somewhere in the back of her mind, her rival was stalking. CHORUS. Her rival would always wait 'til the eighth or ninth bell. He'd be desperate anyway and drunk as well. She always liked to hurt him to prove he was prepared. To love her anyway that she wanted. So she could tell which she preferred. He sat up with his address book trying to think what mood he's in. His finger traced past Georgie's name to someone who needed less persuading. He didn't hear through her disguise he didn't leave her in a rush. Just like the promise that he left on her machine. That almost made her blush. The radio plays a lover's symphony. ""The number you have dialed has been re-directed"". Now she puts him on the speaker-phone. Whenever she has company."
get yourself another fool,"At last I've awakened to see what you've done.. All I can do is pack up and run.. Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.. You said that you loved me. I was yours to command.. Your kind of loving, my heart couldn't stand.. You played me for a fool. Find yourself another fool.. And now, now that we're through, you say you wished you'd be true.. Oh, but deep down in my heart, I know our love could never grow.. And now, now that we're through, you say you wished you'd be true.. Oh, but deep down in my heart, I know our love will never grow.. At last I've awakened to see what you've done.. All I can do is pack up and run.. Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.. Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.."
getting mighty crowded,"I'm packing up my memories. And I'm gonna move all out of your heart. I'm turning in my keys. And I'm gonna move all out of your heart. 'Cause there ain't room enough for two. In dreams that were made for me and you. I'm telling you, it's getting mighty crowded. Too crowded for me. It's getting mighty crowded. I'm gonna take these things of mine. And I'm gonna move all out of your life. Stop wasting my time. And I'm gonna move all out of your life. 'Cause there ain't room enough for three. In dreams that were made for you and me.

Too crowded for me, getting mighty crowded. Too crowded for me, getting mighty crowded."
ghost train,"Maureen and Stan were looking for a job. They got songs for every occasion. And a little limelight robbery. No one will employ them. There's nothing to decide. So he autographs his overdraft. While she goes out of her mind. Stuck on the wall with a thousand faces. Unwanted posters of the haunted places. Roll up for the ghost train. Non-stop through the city. Step right up and show your face. We only want the pretty ones. Roll up for the ghost train. Non-stop through the city. Step right up and show your face. We only want the pretty ones. Maureen and Stan at the skating rink. Looking for the drummer who threw up in the sink. Laughing and singing, dressed up like dice. Maybe they could freeze to death out there on the ice. Look at the graceful way she dances. On foot speaks, the other answers. Roll up for the ghost train. Non-stop through the city. Step right up and show your face. We only want the pretty ones. Roll up for the ghost train. Non-stop through the city. Step right up and show your face. We only want the pretty ones.

You can change your name but you can't change your face. While they make believe it's just another holiday. They turn on each other when they hear that joker say. Roll up for the ghost train. Non-stop through the city. Step right up and show your face. We only want the pretty ones. Roll up for the ghost train. We only want the pretty ones. ."
gigi,"Gigi. Am I a fool without a mind?. Or have I nearly been too blind to realize. Oh, Gigi. While you've been growing up before my eyes. Gigi. You're not all that funny or quick little girl I knew. No, overnight there's been a breathless change in you. Oh, Gigi. While you were trembling on the brink. Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star?. Oh, Gigi. Have I been standing up too close or back too far?. When did your sparkle turn to fire?. And your warmth become desire. Oh, what miracle has made you the way you are?. When did your warmth become desire?. And your sparkle turn to fire?. Oh, what miracle has made you the way you are?. Oh, Gigi."
girls talk,"There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder. I thought I heard you mention my name, can't you talk any louder ?. Don't come any closer, don't come any nearer. My vision of you can't get any clearer. Oh, i just want to hear girls talk. I got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk. But I can't say the words you want to hear. I suppose you're going to have to play it by ear. Right here and now. Girls talk and they want to know how. Girls talk and they say it's not allowed. Girls talk, if they say that it's so. Don't you think that I know by now. That the word up on everyone's lips. Stick that you're dedicated. Though you may not be an old fashioned girl. You're still going to get dated. Was it really murder ?. Were you just pretending ?. Lately I have heard you are the living end. Girls talk and they wanna know about her. Girls talk, they wanna know if I care. Girls talk and they wanna know where."
glitter gulch,Enter Madam X painted in a shocking pink spangled dress. Her teeth are perfect but her mouth is loose. Rubbing their hands together she persuades them that it's better to confess. Which unpleasant fate they'd like to choose. (chorus). Every step might be your last. Money signs are in your eyes sucker. You've been taken in this time. You might just get out alive if you're lucky. All the vultures tuning in to Glitter Gulch. Are looking in on you. And they're hungry. he stood five feet tall in his elevator shoes and stovepipe hat. He was known by several different names. Prompted by Madam X he answered all their questions. And then after that he said I'm sick and tired of stupid games. (chorus). We've got prizes if you can afford. Some small humiliation before you get your reward. And I'd rather be an outlaw than an inlaw to you. And to live my life in miserable poverty. Than to have to grovel to have some dream home hovel. So watch me while I get away with prime time robbery. As he enters Madam X he things of red raged faces and the sweet greenbacks. He climbed upon his honey and he covered her with money. As they do their victory dance. He thinks I hope they choke upon their laughter tracks. They can all go straight to hell while we howl down the whole hotel.
gloomy sunday,"Sunday is gloomy, my hours are slumberless. Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless. Little white flowers will never awaken you. Not when the black coach of sorrow has taken you. Angels have no thought of ever returning you. Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?. Gloomy Sunday. Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all. My heart and I have decided to end it all. Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad, I know. Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go. Death is no dream, for in death I am caressing you. With the last breath of my heart I'll be blessing you. Gloomy Sunday. Dreaming, I was only dreaming. I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart, deep. Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you. My heart is telling you how much I wanted you. Gloomy Sunday."
god give me strength,"Now I have nothing. So God give me strength. 'Cos I'm weak anyway. And if I'm strong I might still break. And I don't have anything to share. That I won't throw away into the air. That song is sung out. This bell is rung out. She was the light that I'd bless. She took my last chance of happiness. So God give me strength. God give me strength. I can't hold on to her. God give me strength. When the phone doesn't ring. And I'm lost in imagining. Everything that kind of love is worth. As I tumble back down to the earth. That song is sung out. This bell is rung out. She was the light that I'd bless. She took my last chance of happiness. So God give me strength. God if she'd grant me her indulgence and decline. I might as well. Wipe her from my memory. Fracture the spell. As she becomes my enemy. Maybe I was washed out. Like a lip-print on his shirt. See, I'm only human. I want him to hurt. I want him. I want him to hurt. Since I lost the power to pretend. That there could ever be a happy ending. That song is sung out. This bell is rung out. She was the light that I'd bless. She took my last chance of happiness. So God give me strength. God give me strength."
god's comic,"wish you'd known me when I was alive, I was a funny feller. The crowd would hoot and holler for more. I wore a drunk's red nose for applause. Oh yes I was a comical priest. ""With a joke for the flock and a hand up your fleece"". Drooling the drink and the lipstick and greasepaint. Down the cardboard front of my dirty dog-collar. Chorus:. Now I'm dead, now I'm dead, now I'm dead,. now I'm dead, now I'm dead. And I'm going on to meet my reward. I was scared, I was scared, I was scared, I was scared. He might of never heard God's Comic. So there he was on a water-bed. Drinking a cola of a mystery brand. Reading an airport novelette, listening to Andrew Lloyd-Webber's ""Requiem"". He said, before it had really begun, ""I prefer the one about my son"". ""I've been wading through all this unbelievable. junk and wondering if I should have given. the world to the monkeys"". Chorus. I'm going to take a little trip down Paradise's endless shores. They say that travel broadens the mind, 'til you can't get your head out of doors. I'm sitting here on the top of the world. I hang around in the longest night. Until each beast has gone bed and then I say. ""God bless"" and turn out the light. While you lie in the dark, afraid to breathe and you beg and you promise. And you bargain and you plead. Sometimes you confuse me with Santa Claus. It's the big white beard I suppose. I'm going up to the pole, where you folks die of cold. I might be gone for a while if you need me. Now I'm dead, now I'm dead, now I'm dead,. now I'm dead, now I'm dead and you're all. going on to meet your reward. Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared?. Are you scared?. You might have never heard, but God's comic."
good year for the roses,"can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray. Lyin' cold the way you left 'em, but at least your lips caressed them while. you packed. Or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't drink. But at least you thought you wanted it, that's so much more than I can say. for me. What a good year for the roses. Many blooms still linger there. The lawn could stand another mowin'. Funny I don't even care. As you turn to walk away. As the door behind you closes. The only thing I have to say. It's been a good year for the roses. After three full years of marriage, it's the first time that you haven't. made the bed. I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we. haven't said. While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind, I find I haven't said a word. >From the bedroom the familiar sound of one baby's cryin' goes unheard. What a good year for the roses. Many blooms still linger there. The lawn could stand another mowin'. Funny I don't even care. As you turn to walk away. As the door behind you closes. The only thing I have to say."
goon squad,"Mother, Father, I'm here in the zoo. I can't come home 'cause I've grown up too soon. I got my sentence. I got my command. They said they'd make me major if I met all their demands.

Goon squad. They've come to look you over and they're giving you the eye. Goon squad. They want you to come out to play. You'd better say goodbye. Some grow just like their dads. And some grow up too tall. Some go drinking with the lads. Some don't grow at all. And you must find the proper place. For everything you see. But you'll never get to make a lampshade out of me. I could join a chain of males or be the missing link. Looking for a lucky girl to put me in the pink. They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod. But I never thought they'd put me in the. Good squad ..... Mother, Father, I'm doing so well. I'm making such progress now that you can hardly tell. I fit in a little dedication. With one eye on the clock. They caught you under medication. You could be in for a shock. Thinking up the alibis that ev'ryone's forgotten. Just another mummy's boy gone to rotten. They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod. But I never thought they'd put me in the."
green shirt,"There's a smart young woman on a light blue screen. Who comes into my house every night.. And she takes all the red, yellow, orange and green. And she turns them into black and white.. But you tease, and you flirt. And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt. You can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it. Better cut off all identifying labels. Before they put you on the torture table. 'Cause somewhere in the ""Quisling Clinic"". There's a shorthand typist taking seconds over minutes. She's listening in to the Venus line. She's picking out names. I hope none of them are mine. But you tease, and you flirt.... Never said I was a stool pigeon. I never said I was a diplomat. Everybody is under suspicion. But you don't wanna hear about that. 'Cause you tease, and you flirt.... Better send a begging letter to the big investigation. Who put these fingerprints on my imagination?. You tease, and you flirt.... You can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it."
green song,"Fine rain was falling on the gravel and glades.. The last rays of September bejewelled broken blades.. But there's someone that I long for.. Oh, where have you been?. As the red earth lies under a covering of green.. Do you trip on the city's golden gutters and kerbs?. As the seasons grow wild and the ground undisturbed.. `Till you find what you are now. Is less than you've been;. As the red earth lies under a covering of green.. Is patience exhausted?. Are your pockets picked clean?. I was lost in the next world. Or somewhere in between.. And it's much as predicted,. They go down that same track.. They say they'll return. But they never come back.. Fine rain was falling on the gravel and glades.. The lest rays of September bejewelled broken blades.. Are you still restless'. Or are you serene?. As the red earth lies under just a covering of green."

harpies bizarre,"He selects the plainest face form a spiteful row of girls. Elegant insulted women, a flaw of cultured pearls. He drops a name or two, she fails to catch. At last he's met his match. Unspoiled and unaffected, he wants her so much. She puts up half-hearted resistance, like she was taught to do. She's heard some of those small town playboys but this is something new. His promise seems dangerous, she'd like to believe. He says ""You'd better leave"". ""You've only got yourself to blame, shame, or deceive"". The waiting lines are long. They never get too far. Everyone wearing that medal with pride. Harpies Bizarre. I looked on but hesitated. I failed to interrupt. You're so hard to tell the truth to. So easy to corrupt. I'll memorize your face. Your tragic smile. The hurt look in your eyes. As you betrayed yourself to the part of him that dies. The waiting lines are long. They never get too far. They're shining up their shoes to kick a falling star. You think you should be somebody. But you don't know who you are. Everyone wearing that medal with pride."

You couldn't guess at. I don't mean jewels. Although they were fine. A way to depart. One way to enter. A right to dismiss upon a whim. When I close the door and. You're supposing. I kick up my heels and then. I scream. ""Why was I chosen? "". You'll never know. What I give to him. He's given me things. You never thought of. Because they were not yours. To give. So take this pill. And tranquilize. And roll your eyes at. The husbands. Not the customers' wives. He's forgiven me trials and tears. And tantrums. And even all my false alarms. You sat there amused. While I was crying. And just seemed to sigh but. That's what money can buy. And now I know why I come. Back to him. And now I know why you'll. Never do. Who are you?. Out there with one penny. You are so many. And we are so few. So cover the canvas if. You're leaving. There's a bowl in the hallway. To wash your hands. If the water runs black. Please leave some silver. Then step past the glass and. Never come back. I'm living up here. And you can see me. Yes, you can look. But you can't touch. Cos you don't belong, the air. Is thin here. You may asphyxiate, my dear. For didn't you tell me. ""You should hold me"". ""Oh please, you must hold me. As if I were hung"". To think you were exciting. When love was frightening.

heart-shaped bruise,"Tell me now, or am I only dreaming?. Tell me now, or are you only teasing?. I felt the cold hard facts of life. Five degrees from freezing.

There's nothing else that I can lose. Except this heart-shaped bruise. It will fade from purple to black. It will fade just as the day was lost into twilight. Tell me now or am I only dreaming?. You said that you'd be mine for life. And now you say you're leaving. If I could hold you once more before you go. When I approach you you just lash out. Should I give up and let you....

hidden shame,"I'm sorry to say that you don't know me. I'm sad in ways you never understood. Each time I try to tell the ugly truth. You always let it pass you by. You said I 'd never tell you a lie. Just because I could. Did you really think I was a bad man?. You always said that that should be my middle name. But you don't know the half of it. You don't know how that name fits. You don't know my hidden shame. Hidden shame, shame, shame. That I can't get free. From the blame and the torture. And the misery. Must it be my secret for eternity?. Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me. Well, there's a different kind of prison. And it don't even have to look much like a cell. It's already on your mind. Boy, we can see it in your eyes. So, here's the bars and walls as well. Well, you know I'm never coming home, babe. You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name. Sure it's easy to be strong. When you know the charge is wrong. But the days and weeks get long. When you've got a hidden shame. CHORUS. I had a friend when I was just a boy. We were like brothers, we would run and hide. And we went walking on a high hillside. And I really don't how it happened. He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye. And not a single word was spoken. I must have pushed him, but I don't remember why. And all at once, he lay there broken. And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh. CHORUS. They say you always hurt the one you love. And I'm not saying if I did or if I didn't. But like my shame, that kind of love is always hidden. They locked me up here for the ideas in my head. They never got me for the thing I really did. CHORUS."
high fidelity,Some things you never get used to. Even though you're feeling like another man. There's nothing that he can do for you. To shut me away as you walk through. Lovers laughing in their amateur hour. Holding hands in the corridors of power. Even though I'm with somebody else right now. High fidelity. Can you hear me?. There's a new kind of dedication. Maybe you'll find it down the tunnel. Maybe I got above my station. Maybe you're only changing channel. Even though you're nowhere near me. And I know you kiss him so sincerely now. Even though the signal's indistinct. And you worry what silly people think. Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out. I bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millions. I suppose he'll never know about.
home is anywhere you hang your head,"Here comes Mr. Misery. He's tearing out his hair again. He's crying over her again. He's standing in the super-market shouting at the customers. Here comes Mr. Misery. He'll never be any good with a mouth full of gold and blood. He's contemplating murder again. He must be in love. Chorus: But you know she doesn't want you. But you can't seem to get it in your head. Oh and you can't sleep at night. And she haunts you when you go to bed. When you're tired of talking and you can't drink it down. So you hang around and drown instead. Home isn't where it used to be. Home is anywhere you hang your head. You hang your head. Home is anywhere. You hang your head. Home is anywhere. You hang your head. Home is anywhere you hang your head. Here comes Mr. Misery. Looking for a place for his mouth to shoot. Saying ""You'd look cute in your birthday suit"". You tore him out and screwed him up. Like a bad page in a naughty picture book. They day ended as it began. As he was seconds older than the man he was this morning. And the world has wiped it's mouth since then. Or maybe it was yawning."
home truth,I hung up the phone tonight. Just as you said I love you. Once this would have been coincidence. Now these things start to bother me. You still close your eyes when I kiss you. And I close mine too. But we didn't open them again. Quite as wide as we should. This is where the home truth ends. This is where the home truth ends. Does your touch feel the same as it should do. Or is it someone quite similar. Who killed me with kindness last night. Now do I look at all familiar?. But none of these things seem to matter. Since we've grown apart. I'd put back the pieces of what's shattered. But I don't know where to start. This is where the home truth ends. This is where the home truth ends. This is where the home truth ends. And I feel like a clown. It's tearing me up. It's tearing me down. You say which are the lies that you tell me. Well where do I begin?. So I turn on the TV again. And the world comes crashing in. Is it my shirt or my toothpaste. That is whiter than white?. Is it the lies that I tell you. Or the lies that I might?. This is where the home truth ends. This is where the home truth ends. Chorus.

Are taking turns at being you. Chorus: Well, well, well. You'd better make up your mind. Honey, are you straight or are you blind?. She's coming in between us you know that she is. I'm not holding on to her but one of us is. My hands are in my pocket, my face is in a book. She could walk 'round naked and I wouldn't sneak a look. Chorus. Honey are you straight or are you blind?. She walked in and your eyes flew out the door. You squeezed my hand 'til the circulation ceases. She's just a doll like so many more. She's the kind of doll that you'd like to pull to pieces. Chorus. Well, well, well. You'd better make up your mind. Honey are you straight or are you blind?."
hoover factory,"Five miles out of London on the Western Avenue. Must have been a wonder when it was brand new. Talkin' 'bout the splendour of the Hoover factory. I know that you'd agree if you had seen it too. It's not a matter of life or death. But what is, what is ?. It doesn't matter if I take another breath. Who cares ? Who cares ?. Green for go, green for action. From Park Royal to North Acton. Past scrolls and inscriptions like those of the Egyptian age. And one of these days the Hoover factory. Is gonna be all the rage in those fashionable pages. Five miles out of London on the Western Avenue. Must have been a wonder when it was brand new. Talkin' 'bout the splendour of the Hoover factory. I know that you'd agree if you had seen it too. It's not a matter of life or death. But what is, what is ?. It doesn't matter if I take another breath. Who cares ? Who cares ?."
how much i lied,"Darling, there is one thing I must tell you, you must know. It's so hard to say the words I feel. This fancy that I'm on's been going on too long. It's time to stop pretending things are real. 'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been living blind. And I just don't know what's right or wrong. To take a chance on losing you is such a silly thing to do. A chance I might wake up and find you gone. Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue. Any private flame could be a lie. Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you. But I know I'll only make you cry. A thief can only steal from you. He cannot break your heart. He can never touch the precious things inside. Someone like you should surely be. Miles and miles away from me. Then you'd never care how much I lied. So try to understand the pain. It takes so long when I explain. Please don't you forget how much I lied. How much I lied."
how to be dumb,"I was hell-bent on destroying my powers of concentration. While you were living like a saint. And all the time the very one you trusted was washing off. somebody else's paint. Now you've got yourself a brand new occupation. Every fleeting thought is a pearl. And beautiful people stampede to the doorway. of the funniest fucker in the world. They're here to help you. Satisfy your desire. There's a bright future for all you professional liars. CHORUS. Now you know how to be dumb. Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes?. Don't you know how to be dumb?. Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes. They emptied out all the asylums, they emptied out all the gaols. The ""New Bruise"" was the name of a dance craze. By ""Jesus Cross and the Cruel Nails"". Followed up by ""Torturing Little Beaver"". With their contraption of barbed wire. Between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require. They'll be howling by midnight, they'll be drooling by dawn. Skulls shrunk down to the size of their brains. Heads shaven and shorn. CHORUS. Trapped in the House of the Perpetual Sucker. Where bitterness always ends so pitifully. You always had to dress up your envy in some half-remembered. philosophy. Now you're masquerading as pale powdered genius. Whose ever bad intention has been purged. You could've walked out any time you wanted but face it you. didn't have the courage. I guess that makes you a full time hypocrite or some kind of. twisted dilettante. Funny though people don't usually get so ugly 'til they think. they know what they want. Scratch your own head stupid. Count up to three. Roll over on your back. Repeat after me. Don't you know how to be dumb?. Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes?. Don't you know how to be dumb?. Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes."
human hands,"I've been talking to the wall and it's been answering me. Oh darling how I miss you. I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness. I crave the silhouette of your kiss. With only the blue light of the TV on. Lip reading threats and false alarms. There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself. And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn. Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt. That it's you that I'm dreaming about. Do I have to draw you a diagram?. All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands. With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze. Checkmate in three moves in your heyday. But the girls don't listen to your line anymore. Now you're part of someone else. On the factory floor and you still say ""Wheres the action?"". Now you manufacture happiness. And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction. (chorus). All you toy soldiers and scaremongers. Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder. In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before. Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly. You know I love you more than slightly. Although I've never said it like this before. (chorus)."
human touch,"I know I've just gotta get out of this place. I can't stand any more of that mechanical grace. Though you say it's only industrial squeeze. It looks like luxury and feels like a disease. Oh give it to me, give it to me. I don't want to know much about much. Give it to me, give it to me. I need, I need, I need the human touch. Left with just a house to hold. Drinking your way to drydock. It's easy to break up a model citizen. Living in the state of shock. I just can't believe I am responsible for this. What the makeup hides can't be hidden with a kiss. When I'm talking in tongues I go where you lead. I don't make you plead, oh I need you. How I'd like to fix her in a picture of rage. How I'd like to catch her when she's acting her age. But when she's laying stretched out on the floor. It's no mystery to me anymore. Chorus. ."
hurry down doomsday,"The man in the corner of this picture has a sinister purpose. In the teeming Temple of the Railroad Kings. He's planting a trashy paperback book for accidental purchase. Containing all the secrets of life and other useless things. But I can't bring myself to look. Wake up Zombie write yourself another book. You want to scream and shout my little flaxen lout. Hurry down Doomsday the bugs are taking over. She sleeps with the shirt of a late, great country singer. Stretched out on her poor jealous husband's pillow. In time you can turn these obsessions into careers. While the parents of those kidnapped children start the bidding. for their tears. But I can't bring myself to look. Wake up Zombie. Get yourself off the book. You want to scream and shout my little waxen lout. Hurry down Doomsday the bugs are taking over. Forget about Beethoven, Rembrandt and rock and roll. Forget about Mickey Mouse, Marlboro and Coca Cola. Forget about Cadillac, Mercedes and Toyota. Forget about Buddha, Allah, Jesus and Jehovah. Hurry down Doomsday the bugs are taking over. Any day now a giant insect mutation. Will swoop down and devour the white man's burden. Starting out with all of the sensitive ones. Better make like a fly if you don't want to die. Look out there goes Gordon. But I can't bring myself to think. Wake up Zombie. Kick up a big stink. You want to scream and shout my little Saxon lout."
i almost had a weakness,"Thank you for the flowers. I threw them on the fire. And I burned the photographs that you had enclosed. GOD they were ugly children. So you're the little bastard of that brother of mine. Trying to trick a poor old woman. 'Til I almost had a weakness. Last week Cousin Florence. Bit your Uncle Joe. Hit him on the forehead with a knife and a fork. (She) said that he looked like the devil. Then she said... ""pass the vinegar,"" I'm beginning to think. (That) I'm the only one who hasn't taken to the drinking of it. Though I almost had a weakness. It pains me to mention. These varicose concerns. While I have to tolerate you family jewels. I really mustn't grumble. ('Cause) when I die the cats and dogs will jump up and down. And you little swines will get nothing."
i can't stand up (for falling down),I'm the living result. I'm a man who's been hurt a little too much. and I've tasted the bitterness of my own tears. sadness is all my lonely heart can feel. I can't stand up for falling down. I can't stand up for falling down. simple though love is. still it confused me. why I'm not loved the way I should be. now I've lived with heartaches. and I've roomed with fear. I've dealt with despair. and I've wrestled with tears. I can't stand up for falling down. I can't stand up for falling down. the vow that we made. you broke it in two. but that don't stop me from loving you. I can't stand up for falling down. I can't stand up for falling down.
i dreamed of my old lover last night,I dreamed of my old lover last night. I wonder if I spoke out loud. And if by chance my lover overheard. He put my face back in the crowd. His eyes were clear and gentle then. He kissed the troubles from my brow. I long to fall to sleep again. And I wonder how he would look now. Would our kids grow sullen or grow strong?. Would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun?. I like the way it feels but then. I rarely dream of anyone. I the songs of shame and the tales of dread. Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead. And all the vines wind through their eyes. Oh but no one knows this passion now. Oh no one knows this passion now. So I keep this fancy to myself. I keep my lipstick twisted tight. I long to fall to sleep again. I dreamed of my old lover last night. I long to fall to sleep again. 'Cause I dreamed of my old lover last night
i hope you're happy now,"He's a fine figure of a man and handsome too. With his eyes upon the secret places he'd like to undo. Still he knows who knows who and where and how. And I hope you're happy now. He's got all the things you need and some that you will never. But you make him sound like frozen food, his love will last forever. Still he know what you want and what you don't allow. And I hope you're happy now. I hope that you're happy now like you're supposed to be. And I know that this will hurt you more than it hurts me. He's acting innocent and proud still you know what he's after. Like a matador with his pork sword, while we all die of laughter. In his turquoise pajamas and motorcycle hat. I hope you're happy now because you'll soon put pay to that. I knew then what I know now I never loved you anyhow. And I hope you're happy now."
i just don't know what to do with myself,"(Burt Bacharach/Hal David). I just don't know what to do with myself. I just don't know what to do with myself. I'm so used to doing everything with you. Planning everything for two. And now that we're through. I just don't know what to do with my time. I'm so lonesome for you, it's a crime. Going to a movie only makes me sad. Parties make me feel as bad. When I'm not with you, I just don't know what to do. Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain. I need your sweet love to beat all the pain. I just don't know what to do with myself. I just don't know what to do with myself. Baby, if your new love ever turns you down. Come back, I will be around. Just waiting for you, I don't know what else to do. Don't know what else to do. I don't know what else to do. I'm still so crazy for you. Oh, oh, oh."
i let the sun go down,"Whenever I'm in the tightest corner. Whenever I feel forlorn. I think of the isle where. I was born. And the duty to which I've sworn. But I woke up in a nightmare. With a Union Jack and half. A crown. John Bull got caught with his. Pants down, again. That's inviting sundown. It's time to do or die. It's time to say ""Good-bye"". Cos I'm the man who lost the. British Empire. Yes I'm the one, I let the. Sun go down. Don't let the shadows lengthen. And cover my good intentions. They say that darkness brings. The right time. But it's also time for tears. I'm so sorry and sincere. Ahead of me a brilliant career. Now I'm going nowhere. It's time to do or die. It's time to say ""Good-bye"". Cos I'm the man who lost the. British Empire. Yes I'm the one I let the. Sun go down. Stay awhile. Delay the night. I'm too young for twilight. They'd tell the sun to hesitate. That's when Britain was Great. Now that the lights are flickering. My pulse is quickening. All over the world the lamps. Will dim. And never be seen again. The balloon's gone up. The night descends. As they lower the flag on. No-man's land. They'll take you down. A peg or two. This is the bitter end. I walk into darkness. It's time to do or die. It's time to say ""Good-bye"". Cos I'm the man who lost the. British Empire. Yes I'm the one, I let the. Sun go down. I let the sun go down. Don't let the sun go down. I let the sun go down"

i still have that other girl,"I have to say that we should finish it now. Before we weaken ’cause we already know this is wrong. I could give in, sometimes I think that I will. Despite the temptation I try to be very strong. In my reluctance seems a surprise. It's not ’cause I don't want you. But I just. Know I must... hesitate. Because I still have that other girl. In my head. I still have that other girl in my head. There may be ugly rumors that. I have been lying. There may be angry tears, but. They're never worth the crying. That is why. Sometimes I... hesitate. Because I still have that other girl. In my head. I still have that other girl in my head. I still have that other girl in my head."
i thought i'd write to juliet,"I thought I'd write to Juliet, for she would understand. And when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down. Instead I find myself talking to you, as my oldest friend. Tell me how I can advise someone, that I don't even know,. To welcome death. For I received a letter that is worth reporting. And though it may raise a cynical smile. It leaves a sinking feeling. Like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant.... ""Have you seen my pride and joy?..."". You know the rest...and it's no joke...Forgive me please as I quote.... ""This is a letter of thanks, as I'm so bored here in I can't. say where.. So I'm writing to people that I may never meet. And I was thinking if something you said..."". ""I'm a female soldier, my name is Constance.. I enlisted in the military needing funds for college. I'm twenty-three years old and if I do get home alive. I imagine I may think again..."". ""I'm sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack. Your words are a comfort, they're the best thing that I have. Apart from family pictures and, of course, my gas mask."
i threw it all away,I once held her. In my arms. She said she would always stay. But I was cruel. And I treated her like a fool. I threw it all away. Once I had mountains. In the palm of my hand. And rivers to drink through everyday. But I must have been mad. I never knew what I had. Until I threw it all away. Love is all there is. That makes the world go round. Love as only love. Can't be denied. Not matter what you think about it. Just won't be able to do without it. Take a tip from one who's tried. So when you find someone. Who gives you all of her love. Take it to your heart don't. Let is stray. Cause one thing for certain. You will surely be hurting. If you throw it all away. If you throw it all away.
i throw my toys around,I've got no time for fairy stories. I'm not a little girl. So you can leave me all alone. And turn off the lights as well. If you were frightened. Then listen:. But I don't think you'd like it. Such a nice kid. Nobody's lookin' now. I throw my toys around. Somebody's bein' very bad. I wonder who it can be. Somebody's goin' to get in trouble. I know it isn't me. I'm just a little angel. But you don't know what I've done. When your back's turned. Nobody's lookin' now. I throw my toys around. Pick up those building blocks. Chop off the baby's locks. Swing dolly by the hair. Put down that teddy bear. Slam dunk that happy clown. I throw my toys around. I've got no time for bedtime stories. I'm not a little child. Everything makes me furious. And everything makes me wild. If you were frightened. Then whistle:. And they'll come runnin' to you. As you boo-hoo. Nobody's looking now. I throw my toys around. I throw my toys around. [repeat and fade].
i turn around,"Sometimes I try so hard to resist, you say you will and I say you won't.. Sometimes I think that you don't exsist and sometimes you don't.. Pinch me 'cause I don't believe it.. Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit.. I turn around and you're not there.. Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?. You're determined to make me as miserable as you can.. You're like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man.. Count 10 and then down again.. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. Doing everything they say shouldn't be done,. more fun than you can have with your clothes on.. Pinch me 'cause I don't believe it.. Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit.. I turn around and you're not there.. Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?. You're determined to make me as miserable as you can.. You're like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man.. I turn around and you're not there.. Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?. The less I see of you, the more I care.. The less I see of you, the more I care.."
i wanna be loved,Why must I be so lonely?. When so many people pass me by. I've been waiting for oh so long now. And yet I'm unable to answer why. I can't be made to give up now. Can you find room for me. in your heart somehow?. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved. I guess I'm a victim of loneliness. But why should this be my destiny?. A foolish man for a lot of my life. Shouldn't there be someone. Someone for me?. I hope and I pray some happy day. That I'll be around to hear you say. I wanna be loved. I just wanna be loved. .
i want to vanish,I want to vanish. This is my fondest wish. To go where I cannot be captured. Laid on a decorated dish. Even in splendor this curious fate. Is more than I care to surrender. Now it's too late. Whether in wonder or indecent haste. You arrange the mirrors and the spools. To snare the rare and precious jewels. That were only made of paste. If you should stumble upon my last remark. I'm crying in the wilderness. I'm trying my best to make it dark. How can I tell you I'm rarer than most. I'm certain as a lost dog. Pondering a sign post. Chorus. I want to vanish. This is my last request. I've given you the awful truth. Now give me my rest.
i want you,"Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell. I don't think I can live without you. And I know that I never will. Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death. I can't say anymore than ""I love you"". Everything else is a waste of breath. I want you. You've had your fun you don't get well no more. I want you. Your fingernails go dragging down the wall. Be careful darling you might fall. I want you. I woke up and one of us was crying. I want you. You said ""Young man I do believe you're dying"". I want you. If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days. I want you. You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways. I want you. Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget. I want you. Since when were you so generous and inarticulate. I want you. It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for. It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for. I want you. It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing. It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing. I want you. He tossed some tatty compliment your way. I want you. And you were fool enough to love it when he said. ""I want you"". I want you. The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark. It scares you witless. But in time you see things clear and stark. I want you. Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop. I want you. I'm afraid I won't know where to stop. I want you. I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you. I want you. I want to know the things you did that we do too. I want you. I want to hear he pleases you more than I do. I want you. I might as well be useless for all it means to you. I want you. Did you call his name out as he held you down. I want you. Oh no my darling not with that clown. I want you. I want you. You've had your fun you don't get well no more. I want you. No-one who wants you could want you more. I want you. I want you. I want you. Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up. I want you. I'm going to say it once again 'til I instill it. I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it. I want you. I want you. I want you."
i'll never fall in love again,What do you get when you fall in love?. A girl with a pin to burst your bubble. That's what you get for all your trouble. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. What do you get when you kiss a girl?. You get enough germs to catch pneumonia. After you do she'll never phone you. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. Don't tell me what it's all about. 'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out. Out of those chains those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you. What do you get when you give your heart?. You get it all broken up and battered. That's what you get a heart that's shattered. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. Out of those chains those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you. What do you get when you fall in love?. You only get lies and pain and sorrow. So for at least until tomorrow. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again. I'll never fall in love again.
i'll wear it proudly,"I hate these flaming curtains they're not the color of your hair. I hate these striplights they're not so undoing as your stare. I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I wanna do is tear. I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here. [chorus]. Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down. And nail my feet up where my head should be. If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown. And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly. Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm. In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm. You have this expression dear no words could take its place. And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face. [chorus]. I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls. If you'll wear it proudly through the snakepits and catcalls. Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss. If you don't know what is wrong with me. Then you don't know what you've missed. We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight. When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright. But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess. And a handful of eagerness says ""What do you suggest?""."
i'm in the mood again,Hail to the taxis. They go where I go. Farewell the newspapers that know more than I know. Flung under a street-lamp still burning at dawn. I'm in the mood again. I walk the damp streets rather than slumber. Along the fine windows of shameless and plunder. But none of their riches could ever compare. I'm in the mood again. I don't know what's come over me. But it's nothing that I'm doing wrong. You took the breath right out of me. Now you'll find it in the early hours. In a lover's song. I lay my head down on fine linens and satin. Away from the mad-hatters who live in Manhattan. The Empire State Building illuminating the sky.
i'm not angry,"You're upstairs with the boyfriend while I'm left here to listen.. I hear you calling his name, I hear the stutter of ignition.. I could hear you whispering as I crept by your door.. So you found some other joker who could please you more.. I'm not angry, I'm not angry anymore.. I'm not angry, I'm not angry anymore.. Ooh, I know what you're doin'.. I know where you've been.. I know where, but I don't care,. 'cause there's no such thing as an original sin.. I've got this camera click, click, clickin' in my head.. I got you talking with your hands, got you smiling with your legs.. Spent all my time in a vanity factory,. wonderin' when they're gonna come and take it all back.."
i'm your toy,"You may be sweet and nice. That won't keep you warm at night. 'Cause I'm the one who taught you how. To do the things you're doing now. He may feel all your charms. He may hold you in his arms. But I'm the one who let you in. I was right beside you then. Once upon a time. You let me feel you deep inside. And nobody knew, nobody saw. Do you remember the way you cried?. I'm your toy, I'm your old boy. But I don't want no one but you to love me. Oh I wouldn't lie. You know I'm not that kind of guy. Once upon a time. You let me feel you deep inside. And nobody knew, nobody saw. Do you remember the way you cried?. I'm your toy, I'm your old boy. But I don't want no one but you to love me. Oh I wouldn't lie. You know I'm not that kind of guy. ."
i've been wrong before,"The night we met. The night that I won't forget. You've seen what I've been waiting for. But baby, I've been wrong before. You held me tight. And everything seemed just right. I couldn't ask for more. But baby, I've been wrong before. She used to smile at me. And hold my hand like you do. Then she left me. And broke my heart in two. See her face. And feel your warm embrace. You're all that I adore. But baby, I've been wrong before. Oh baby, I've been wrong before. ."
if i could believe,"If I could believe two and two is five. Two wrongs make a right. Well then, man alive. Lost in my insolence and sneers. That might sound like prayers. If I could believe. If I could believe. You were from heaven sent. Then just losing you. Would be my punishment. But in the hour of disgrace. I might see his face. If I could believe. If I could believe. Then I know I might. Sleep all through the night. But how many times must I wake in fright. Nagging doubts still tugging on my sleeve. If I could believe two and two is five. Two wrongs make a right. Well then, man alive. Lost in my insolence and sneers. That might sound like prayers. If I could believe. If I could believe"
imagination (is a powerful deceiver),"So you're trying to make connection, you heard whispers in the hall. She'll be out again this evening, when you come around to call. So, you dodge the lady-killer, who came creepin' 'cross the floor. Then you caught up in a whirlwind, you got blown right out the door. Oh, yes, it was a whirlwind, sweet romance was on your side. If you wanna dance on my face, you must tell me why ya' lied. Imagination is a powerful deceiver. When you try to believe her just a little too much. Imagination is a powerful deceiver. I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch. I see a look of recognition, so well hidden in your eye. And your peepshow regulations, they just don't seem to apply,. Well, did I see you in the circus, in the ring without a hand. Now you think that you can curse us, steal the show and stop the band. Oh, you can follow your dreams, oh but please don't lead me on,. If you wanna bleed in my face, you were here and now you're gone. Imagination is a powerful deceiver. When you try to believe her just a little too much. Imagination is a powerful deceiver. I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch. I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch."
impatience,"How long do I have to wait?. Before I can tell you the things I've been wanting to say. How long must I hesitate?. I know it makes sense but it's hard for me to stay away. But if this is how it has to be. Maybe it's just a feeling. That I could name. But I'd probably best blame...impatience. You can't miss - what you've never known. It's quite absurd how you started disturbing me so. Sometimes - when I am all alone. I lose my senses. I have no defences to go. But if this is how I lose my heart. Then I shall just embrace that. My pulse is racing still. I'm secretly thrilled. By the laughter that tumbled. And the tears that I spilled. As far as I know no one ever got killed. By impatience. Tell me - is there danger still?. I took no heed so a word might as well be deed. Although - I'd really like to see you now. I'm almost certain it can't be accomplished with speed. So, if this how I'll bide my time. Then I will set it down. Til we lose our caution. I'll honour your order. 'Cos it's such sweet torture. To carry this torch. In the light of temptation. Beyond conversation and all expectation. Pausing a moment or two just mention...."
imperial bedroom,"Everyone agreed that she looked delightful. Except for her sister, who was hateful and spiteful. Blushing bright red from her head to her feet. But rushing into her bridal suite. The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. Life turns out like a TV serial. A head full of daydreams, his hands full of material. She says it's nothing, he's messing up her hair. And still he looks so neat. Stepping into the bridal suite. The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. So the best man will do his best again. Now they're getting dressed again. Blushing bright red from her head to her feet. Sneaking out of the bridal suite. The imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. We know who you're with and where you are. In the imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. Two names under the register. In the imperial bedroom, the regal boudoir. This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir. Au revoir."
in the darkest place,"In the darkest place. I know. That is where you'll find me. Even though you didn't have to remind me. I shut out the lights. Your eyes adjust. They'll never be the same. You know I love you so. Lets start again. Since you put me down. It seems. I've been very gloomy. You may laugh, but pretty girls look right through me. They don't sense the faintest glimmering. That is the torch I bear. There's light enough for me to find my way. But I only have to tell myself that by now. You could be with someone else. Is there light beneath your door and. Laughter from within?. Do your friends come around. Saying, ""Try to find another lover""?. He won't love you like I do. In the darkest place. I'm lost. I have abandoned every hope. Maybe you'll understand I must. Shut out the light. Your eyes adjust. They'll never be the same. You know I love you so. Lets start again. Do your friends come around. Saying, ""Try to find another lover""?. He won't love you like I do. In the darkest place. That is where you'll find me. In the darkest place. That is where you'll find me."
inch by inch,"You can take a powder. You can take a drink. You can keep the shrink. And the kitchen sink. Write my name in heaven. in invisible ink. I just woke up from dreaming, I think. You can take me over. You can give me a lip. You can take me under. You can give me the slip. Take off everything or tear me off a strip. Like a lady in the chamber. and another in the clip. Chorus. Don't move a muscle baby. Don't even flinch. You can miss me by a mile. Or just inch by inch. Inch by inch. Inch by inch. Inch by inch. You can pull me up again. Inch by inch. Inch by inch. As pulses race. I long to see that look upon your face. You can take me outside. You can take me apart. You can take me upstairs. you can take me to heart. You made me love you when. you thought you were so smart. Don't try to stop me when. you told me to start. Chorus."
indoor fireworks,We play these parlour games. We play at make believe. When we get to the part where I say that I'm going to leave. Everybody loves a happy ending but we don't even try. We go straight past pretending. To the part where everybody loves to cry. (chorus). Indoor fireworks. Can still burn your fingers. Indoor fireworks. We swore we were safe as houses. They're not so spectacular. They don't burn up in the sky. But they can dazzle or delight. Or bring a tear. When the smoke gets in your eyes. You were the spice of life. The gin in my vermouth. And though the sparks would fly. I thought our love was fireproof. Sometimes we'd fight in public darling. With very little cause. But different kinds of sparks would fly. When we got on our own behind closed doors. (chorus). It's time to tell the truth. These things have to be faced. My fuse is burning out. And all that powder's gone to waste. Don't think for a moment dear that we'll ever be through. I'll build a bonfire of my dreams. And burn a broken effigy of me and you.
invasion hit parade,"Now that you set everybody free. What are you going to do about me?. Don't want to be treated like some poor grateful clown. I'd rather go back to the sweet underground. Where I can tell by the colour of my skin. And I know my neighbour 'cos he's the one, yes he's the one. Who always turns me in. A woman works the tunnel in the middle of the night. Picking up every lost object in sight. Handbags, toupees, lost legs and fingernails. The black market eats up all your failures. Her transistor offers no salvation or regrets. No pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Just non-stop Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes. CHORUS. There's no name, no name for the place or pain we'll cause you. again and again. If you do not co-operate with the Invasion Hit Parade. The liberation forces make movies of their own. Playing their Doors records and pretending to be stoned. Drowning out a broadcast that wasn't authorised. Incidentally the revolution will be televised. With one head for business and another for good looks. Until they started arriving with their rubber aprons and their. butcher's hooks. CHORUS. They're hunting us down here with Liberty's light. A handshaking double talking procession of the mighty. Pursued by a T.V. crew and coming after them. A limousine of singing stars and their brotherhood anthem. The former dictator was impeccably behaved. They're mopping up all the stubborn ones who just refuse to be saved"
isabelle in tears,"Isabelle in tears. Isabelle is ringing. Saying ""I need you near to me. But a telephone just isn't worth. The flinging. "". ""Like a book or that ashtray that. I aimed at your head. I'd rather see you dead"". But it's not as it appears. So I tripped up the stairs to find. Isabelle in tears. Isabelle remains Isabelle in tethers. Wears a flimsy negligee of. Innocence and feathers. She says, ""That's a good idea"" as. She pours herself a shot. But she can't get the genius back. Into the bottle. ""After you're kind you'll find that. No-one cares"". So her lovers and her fears leave a. Isabelle in tears. And I left her standing out there. In the rain. Calling my name. As I pulled away pretending that. I'd never met her. You never know the thrill. Of the Isabelle of memory. They say she was a bombshell. Who turned to an incendiary. 'Til the whole town burned down. And returned into the earth. Can you admit your love?. Can you confess her worth?. That slant of time obscures. But on certain nights appears. Like Isabelle in tears"
it tears me up,"I see you walk with him. I see you talk to him. It tears me up, oh, it tears me up. And I can't stop crying. Oh, baby, I can't stop crying. I see you kiss his lips. And squeeze his fingertips. It tears me up, oh, baby, it tears me up. And there's nothing I can do about it. Oh, baby, baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you. It's a faithless world we're livin' in. When I turn around and there you are with my best friend. Sometimes when you pass me on the street. You look at me as if to say I'm sorry my sweet. And being sorry might be enough. Then you look back at him and [ ? ] a smile. And that makes me feel kinda rough. Oh, darlin, it tears me up. I see you smile at him. You never tire of him. It tears me up. Oh, baby, it tears me up. There's nothing I can do about it. Baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you. Still hungry for something I can't have. Oh, it tears me up so bad. Still hungry for something I can't have. Tears me up so bad. Can't you see I'm still in love with you. Still hungry for something I can't have. Baby, please, please, please. I'm still hungry for something I can't have. It tears me up so bad. Oh, oh, it tears me up so bad. Tears me up so bad."
it's time,"The party's over. Your time is up. You've had your last pointless teardrop. Washed down in that broken coffee cup. This magic moment concludes when that cigarette ends. Did you get what you wanted?. Well I suppose that depends. Well I suppose that depends. If you go, if you go. Where passion is squandered and money is spent. It's time, it's time. It's time, it's time. It's time, it's time, it's time. You must see it's time that you went. You must see it's time that you went. Our brief acquaintance was such a mistake. Now it seems more like a sentence. Or something you always had to fake. This magic moment concludes when they turn out the light. It's not the days when you leave me. But all I fear are the nights. But all I fear are the nights. Chorus. You told the same joke to me too many times. I wish that someone would hit it. Just before you reach. Just before you reach. Just before you reach the punchline. The party's over. Time we broke up. It always seemed like a bad dream. One where I finally woke up. This magic moment concluding our mutual fate. But if you do have to leave me. Who will I have left to hate?. Who will I have left to hate?. Chorus."
jack of all parades,"When we first met I didn't know what to do. My old love lines were all worn out on you. And the world walked round at my mouth. They lit me up and they snuffed me out. [chorus]. And I was everybody's boy. But soon that thrill just fades. To be the love of one true heart. Or the Jack of all parades. You won't know who to thank. You won't know who to blame. It's just a part of the Murdering Game. 'Cos down in the fleshpots. Where they pay you in pounds. They're laughing like drains. And baying like bloodhounds. For the Jack of all parades. The Jack of all parades. Once I knew a girl. That looked so much like Judy Garland. That people would stop and give her money. And everybody was Frankie, Jimmy or Bobby. Not the Jack, the Jack of all Parades,. Oh the Jack, the Jack of all Parades,. Oh the Jack, of all Parades.. Now the way that I feel is no longer news. You know my love and how to refuse it. Cause you know where the door is. And how to use it. Oh you know you do. But from my chequered past. To this shattered terrace. Where you can't keep your mind off. the Crimes of Paris. And you can't keep your peace. And try to forget it. And I can't forgive you. For things you haven't done yet. Oh I was anybody's boy. But soon that thrill just fades. To be the love of one true heart. Or the Jack of all parades. When we first met I didn't know what to do. My old love lines were all worn out on you. And the world walked 'round my mouth. I didn't mean to say it. I just blurted it out. As you pretended not to notice. Or be taken aback. And I loved you there and then. It's as simple as that. Oh I was everybody's boy. But soon that thrill just fades. To be the love of one true heart. Or the Jack of all parades. To be the love of one true heart. Or the Jack of all parades."

joe porterhouse,The children sit upon the stairs. High above a valley of tears. Don't let them see you crying that way oh no. Oh no Joe Porterhouse. Is not gone forever. He'll be back another day. Don't let them see you crying that way. Chorus. Please don't wake him let him sleep. It's a moment she can keep. Like an old bus ticket or a photograph. Resting on the mantlepiece. While for the wicked there is no peace. She says it's not his time to go. Why we were nearly lovers years ago. Now what is left for me. Among the broken branches of the family tree. Heart like an anchor. Arms like cable. He stood all alone on an iron turntable. Don't let them see you crying that way oh no. The sun beats down. It's cracking the flags. Boys who should know better. Are stamping out fags. Don't let them see you laughing that way. Chorus. Oh no Joe Porterhouse. Is not gone forever. He'll be back another day. Don't let them see you crying that way.
jump up,"Everybody's talking like they can't sit down. And looking like they can't stand up. It must be the lastest style. And they've seen a lot of things that you never see. Back on the mile up to the hanging tree. Some people can't keep their fingers clean. Just clicking their heels to the beat of the scene. Trying to keep careen until the first edition of last night's obituries. Jump up--hold on tight. Can't trust the promise or a guarantee. 'Cause the man 'round the curve says that he's never heard. Of you or me. No tombstone would ever surprise me. When I'm locked in a room about half the size of a matchbox. Got holes in my socks. They match the ones that I got in my feet. I put my feet in the holes in the street and somebody paved me over. I was a statue standing on the corner. Tell me, how else can a boy get to see those pretty pleats?. Candidate talkin' on the radio from the ""Cheaters Jamboree"". It must be their lastest fool. 'Cause it's a two-horse race and he changed his bets. Like it was just another brand of cigarettes. Some people judge and they just guess the rest. They can't understand that don't mean that you're blessed. They ought to catch the Express Next Stop No Where. That way you can forget. Jump up--hold on tight. Can't trust the promise or a guarantee. 'Cause the man 'round the curve says that he's never heard."
just a curio,"In the cold pale sunlight that was slanting down, I spied. Frost reflecting on the glass and in the air outside,. Fond relations mouthing words of love and tragedy.. Though it's cold there's vapour rising from a moving stream.. In a narrow, shallow bed of fine linen and starch,. Where her long hair tumbled once upon her graceful arch,. Lace hung on the counters and the walnut cabinets,. Teeth ware chattering like schoolgirls clicking castanets.. There will be no light to guide as you ascend the stairs.. There may be a candle as you kneel and say your prayers.. Throw the window wide and open, keep this mark from me,. Just the letter ""T"" and its most dread companion ""B"".. How in heaven? Hadn't it been conquered long ago?. How did it come back again? It's just a curio."
just a memory,"Layin' about, lyin' in bed. Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said. With the tempo of today and the temptation of tomorrow. I don't know if I could give you anything but sorrow. They stay alive this late on Radio Five. But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth. 'Cause the moments that I can't recall. Are the moments that you treasure. Better take another measure for measure. Losing you is just a memory. Memories don't mean that much to me. Losing you is just a memory. Memories don't mean that much to me. Now you're here, I'm here too. Could be this easy for me and you. Losing you is just a memory. Memories don't mean that much to me. Losing you is just a memory. Memories don't mean that much to me. Lyin' about layin' in bed. Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said."
just about glad,"I'm just about glad that I knew you once. And it was more than just a passing acquaintance. I'm just about glad that it was a memory. That doesn't need constant maintenance. There are a few things that I regret. But nothing that I need to forget. For all of the courage that we never had. I'm just about glad. CHORUS:. Just about glad we didn't do that thing. Just about glad we didn't have that fling. Just about glad we didn't give it a try. Just about glad, is that a tear in your eye. And on the few times I rang to propose. There was a man there or so I suppose. The greatest lover that you never had. I'm just about glad. They called time and vodka and lime. In some far flung Canadian club. (Just about glad). And there I was just waiting to fall. Like a toe just aching to stub. (Just about glad). Later on I could never accept it. When you finally gave it all to him. (Just about glad). And you said that my nurse was sweet. But her lamp was just beginning to dim. I'm just about glad. That we never did that thing we were going to do. I'm just about glad I can look you in the eye. But I can't say the same for you. And though the passion still flutters and flickers. It never got into our knickers. For all of the courage that we never had. I'm just about, I'm just about. I'm just about, I'm just about. CHORUS. And it's all just a stupid creation. Of my feverous imagination. If I'm the greatest lover that you never had. I'm just about, I'm just about. I'm just about, I'm just about. CHORUS. Is that a tear in your eye [3x]."
kid about it,He saw no tears in her eyes. Say you wouldn't kid about it. She's telling all of those lies. She swore she'd never told before. But I doubt it. So he bit his tongue. And tried hard to capture his breath. When she said I waited all my life. For just a little death. Say you wouldn't kid about it. Say you wouldn't kid about it. Say you wouldn't kid about it. Sometimes he takes himself so seriously. She makes her movements mysteriously. Slow fast or furiously. It's a big responsibility. With a face full of mixed ability. Big dreams of elegance. Singing the leaving of Liverpool. And turning into Americans. Say you wouldn't kid about it. So what if this is a man's world. I want to be a kid again about it. Give me back my sadness. I couldn't hide it even if I tried girl. We fight so frail. Making love tooth and nail. You gave me the kiss of my life. I might even live to tell the tale. (chorus).
kinder murder,"Here in the bar, the boys like to have fun. There's a wager lost and an argument won. There's a stone-washed damsel on a junk food run. It's a kinder murder. There's a ladder to heaven from a battered stiletto. Spitting out the words that he put into her mouth. See her in silhouette going down south. It's a kinder murder. It's a kinder murder. She could have kept her knees together. Should have kept her mouth shut. It's a kinder murder. It's a kinder murder. Jimmy took her down to the perimeter fence. He was back in half an hour, he said he left her senseless. Then he went back to his regiment. It's a kinder murder. The officer said it has to be denied. There's a tear-stained would-be teenage bride. All the family pride in the little ram-rider. It's a kinder murder. It's a kinder murder. She could have kept her knees together. Should have kept her mouth shut. It's a kinder murder. It's a kinder murder. The child went missing and the photo fit his face. Dishonoured Jimmy just read about the case. He said that he was just taking up space. It's a kinder murder. Jimmy took his best friend's keys from the pile on the table in a flash. He was dreaming of the pigskin seats and the walnut dash. The knickers in her handbag and the one false eyelash. It's a kinder murder. It's a kinder murder. She could have kept her knees together. Could have kept her mouth shut."
king horse,"Cheap cut satin and bad perfume. Showtime is almost here. Teased up by a strip cartoon. Laughing up your sleeve. Sniggering in your beer. He'd seen the bottom of a lot of glasses. But he'd never seen love so near. He'd seen love get so expensive. But he'd never seen love get so dear. Now I know that you're all King Horse. Between tenderness and brute force (repeat). She can turn upon a sixpence in the mouth and trousers set. Hit the bill, ring the bell, never spill a sip. And still she knows the kind of tip that she is gonna get. A lot of loose exchanges, precious little respect. When it's someone else's weekend. That's the best you can expect. Chorus. So fond of the fabric. So fond of fabrication. From comic books to tragic. Through the heart of complications. Meanwhile back in some secluded spot. He says 'will you please?' and she says 'stop'. If I ever lose this good thing that I've got. I never want to hear the song you dedicated tonight. Cause I knew that song so long before we met. That it means much more than it might."
king of confidence,"She had her mind made up just like her face. She painted in the lines and shadows. She shaded color in that would express. The lonely mood that follows. Love, short and painful and tidy lies in self-defense. She just told a thing or two to the King of Confidence. You said that he could tell her anything. She even held him when he was crying. And made her feel she was the only one. You knew that he was lying when he said he was lying. Love is short and painful, that she finally made sense. Of the love he had for the one and only King of Confidence. It's hard enough to be your lover, let alone your confidant. You say you know what I need but you don't know who I want. It's just another tawdry morning now. another tarnished farewell. Your body's tired and complaining now. But you're too tore down to tell. Love is short and painful, all you kind ladies and gents. I spent years in a couple of days as the King of Confidence. It's hard enough to be your lover, let alone your confidant. You say you know what I need but you don't know who I want. It's just another tawdry morning now. another tarnished farewell. Your body's tired and complaining now. But you're too tore down to tell. Love is short and painful, all you kind ladies and gents. I spent years in a couple of days as the King of Confidence."
king of thieves,"I had forgotten all about 'The Case Of The Three Pins'. THEY SAID I MUST BE CRACKED. Until the brown paper parcel landed on my welcome mat. Even the pretty secretaries who wouldn't even. Let me HANG MY HAT. All recognize my handwriting. And return to sender as a matter of fact. If I were you I'd change my name again. They don't care what they do to you believe me. This is the coronation of the King of Thieves. His occupation is the King of Thieves. He can steal more than you can save. You can take him on, but you're not that brave. I'll tell your fortune in a minute or two. I might even tell you what comes next. The moguls want a HUMAN SACRIFICE. AND LOOK AT THAT GIRL, YOUNG HUNGRY AND PERPLEXED. They took away the best years of her life. Ah but it's all in good fun. And if you kept you nose clean. You can laugh now at the caring things they've done. I'll write this story down, but you'll never guess the. Final twist. Blow the whistle on the whole design. As they find my name on that fatal mailing list. I hear the clatter of a typewriter. Another rookie eating up the reams. I think it's time to place my feet under the desk. And PUT MY MARK ON ANOTHER MAN'S DREAMS. This is the coronation of the King of Thieves. And look at that girl. Look at that girl. LOOK AT THAT GIRL."
last boat leaving,"Hush my little one don't cry so. You know your Daddy's bound to go. They took his pride. They took his voice. Don't upset him now, don't make a noise. They said ""You're lucky son you've still got a choice"". Last boat leaving. Don't waste your tears. It's not as if I'm in chains. I don't want to go now, it would be better for. you, too, if I don't look back when we sail. Hush my dear, while I whisper it in your ear. We're not going to sail tonight. We're going to disappear. And it feels like a punishment, but I don't know what for. Take care of your mother, son, it's you that she adores. 'Cos no matter how long we sail we'll never reach the shore. Last boat leaving. So dry your tears. It's not as if I'm in chains. When you go to school, son, you'll read my story in history books. Only they won't mention my name. So hush now, my darling, my sweet little one. I hope that you never have to do what I've done. Do you know what I've done?. Why I'm going away? On the last boat leaving this stinking town. It's the last boat leaving, it's the last boat leaving. You've had my innocence, you've had my heartbreak. You've taken the place where I once belonged. Now what more can you take?."

lesson in cruelty,"(Words: Costello, music: Nieve). Here's a thought to dwell upon,. Daddy's girl is almost gone. Now there's just a vain princess. 'Her Ruthlessness'. Tearing up the nursery. Stars more used to glittering. Pictured in the guttering. Faces caught about to laugh. Torn in half. Slipping through your fingers. See them scatter. Maybe it doesn't matter. But I still really want to pick pieces up. You can't fool me. With this lesson in cruelty. It's not as if I was asking time to stop. In violent blue. Like roses red. She laughed as she tore off his head. The hours she gazed on her former champion. Now it's just a frame of sellotape and torn wallpaper. As she rips his pretty face to bits. -Chorus. It's too much too soon or so it seems. To put away these childish dreams. You'll find out soon enough that worship can be tough. Love is just a name to celebrate a vision. Or confetti littered with regrets.. See it scatter.... Dear heart to good to waste. But if some hot-head should claim it. Don't rush to his embrace. And it remains to say.... I'll love you just the same, whatever your decision. As you put the paper to the flame. (It's a lesson in cruelty)."
let him dangle,"Bentley said to Craig ""Let him have it Chris"". They still don't know today just what he meant by this. Craig fired the pistol, but was too young to swing. So the police took Bentley and the very next thing. Let him dangle. Let him dangle. Bentley had surrendered, he was under arrest,. when he gave Chris Craig that fatal request. Craig shot Sidney Miles, he took Bentley's word. The prosecution claimed as they charged them with murder. Let him dangle. Let him dangle. They say Derek Bentley was easily led. Well what's that to the woman that Sidney Miles wed. Though guilty was the verdict, and Craig had shot him dead. The gallows were for Bentley and still she never said. Let him dangle. Let him dangle. Well it's hard to imagine it's the times that have changed. When there's a murder in the kitchen that is brutal and strange. If killing anybody is a terrible crime. Why does this bloodthirsty chorus come round from time to time. Let him dangle. Not many people thought that Bentley would hang. But the word never came, the phone never rang. Outside Wandsworth Prison there was horror and hate. As the hangman shook Bentley's hand to calculate his weight. Let him dangle. From a welfare state to society murder. Bring ""back the noose"" is always heard. Whenever those swine are under attack. But it won't make you even. It won't bring him back. Let him dangle."
let me tell you about her,"I wasn't very indiscreet and yet. That is a notion that I might as well forget. Friends look at me these days with fond surprise. But when I start to speak they roll their eyes. Let me tell you about her. Hush now, I've said too much. There's something indescribable I can't quite catch. Let me tell you about her. The way that she makes me feel. Then draw a curtain on this scene I shan't reveal. Some things are too personal. Too intimate to spill. And gentlemen don't speak of them. And this one never will. I wasn't very conversational. Except to say that, ""You're sensational"". Friends now regard me with indulgent smiles. But when I start to sing they run for miles. Let me tell you about her. Hush now, I've said too much. There's something indescribable I can't quite catch. Let me tell you about her. The way that she makes me feel."
let them all talk,Hear what I say. See what I do. Believe me now I'm all over you. All over you. I know a place. A CERTAIN VERY TENDER SPOT. TO HAVE AND TO HOLD. TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. Listening to the sad song that the radio plays. Have we come this fa-fa-fa to find a soul cliche. Let them talk. Let them talk. Let them all talk. Oh yeah we're killing time. Just to KEEP YOU CLOCKING ON. These are the best years of your life. Now they're here and gone. Do the world a service. And you could do yourself a favour. WHOSE TONGUE NOW IS TASTING LAST WEEK'S FLAVOUR. Our day will come. When you have squandered all your youth. To have and to hold. A stranger to the truth. Listening to the sad song that the radio plays. Have we come this fa-fa-fa to find a soul cliche. Let them talk.
let's misbehave,"You could have a great career,. And you should;. Yes you should.. Only one thing stops you dear:. You're too good;. Way too good!. If you want a future, darlin',. Why don't you get a past?. 'Cause that fateful moment's comin' at last.... We're all alone, no chaperone. Can get our number. The world's in slumber--let's misbehave!. There's something wild about you child. That's so contagious. Let's be outrageous--let's misbehave!. When Adam won Eve's hand. He wouldn't stand for teasin'.. He didn't care about those apples out of season.. They say that Spring means just one little thing to little lovebirds. We're not above birds--let's misbehave!. It's getting late and while I wait. My poor heart aches on. Why keep the breaks on? Let's misbehave!. I feel quite sure affaire d'amour. Would be attractive. While we're still active, let's misbehave!. You know my heart is true. And you say you for me care.... Somebody's sure to tell,. But what the heck do we care?. They say that bears have love affairs. And even camels. We're men and mammals--let's misbehave!"
life shrinks,Shall I wear a buttonhole to jog your memory?. So you'll recall the promise. That I swore you made to me when we were younger. You look sorry for yourself but what about?. I'm some idea you're not without a doubt. So you can put away that tongue. I don't know who I'm trying to kid. I'll find another name for you. I'll try to put the blame on you. For everything we did. Life shrinks and before you know it. You have forgotten all the cuts and bruises. Just be thankful we were only fighting for buttons. And you know by now who loses. You're only half awake because you never go to bed. And when he hears about it. You know then the both of you's is dead and that's a promise. You'll be sorry because I won't tell you again. You'll stick like that one day. And if you don't believe me go and ask St. Thomas. I don't know where it's going to stop. Spend your whole time trying to stay. From breaking down or running away. Or trying to keep up.
lip service,You left the motor running.. But I know you're so attractive.. Getting in some sharp practice.. You better not do anything reckless.. But everybody is going through the motions.. Everybody is going through the motions.. Are you really only going through the motions?. Lip service is all you'll ever get from me.. Lip service is all you'll ever get from me.. Lip service is all you'll ever get from me.. But if you change your mind. you can send it a letter to me. Don't make any sudden movements.. These are dangerous amusements.. When did you become so choosy?. Don't act like you're above me;. just look at your shoes.. [Repeat bridge and chorus]. But if you change your mind. you can send it a letter to me. But if you change your mind. you can send it a letter to me. But if you change your mind.
lipstick vogue,Don't say you love me when it's just a rumour. Don't say a word if there is any doubt.. Sometimes I think that love is just a tumour;. you've got to cut it out.. You say you're sorry for the things that you've done.. You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it.. I wouldn't worry. I had so much fun.. Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being. It's you. not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue. It's you. not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue. oh yeah.. Get to the slot machine almost dead on arrival. Just hit me one more time with that live wire. Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million. You say I've got not feelings;. this is a good way to kill them.. Select the control and then insert the token. You wanna throw me away but I'm not broken.. You've got a lot to say. Well I'm not joking.. There are some words they don't allow to be spoken.. Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being. It's you. not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue.
little atoms,"I arose and Marigold lay down with Curious Iris. Cherry gave to Victor her prudence and her virus. FOr the sake of purity I can recall the time and place. Between wisdom and murder she gave up her. Immaculate face. My poor belated chastity fell foul. of grown up games. With false and lovely modesty. I can recall the names I'll miss. In the particle of me that cares for this. I betrayed those little atoms with a kiss. Patience has her virtue still but every grace. must have its price. I through some felicity may spin a tale. of constant vice. I took my better nature out, drowned it. in the babbling stream. Took the blossom of my youth. and blew it all to smithereens. My poor belated chastity fell foul. of grown up games. With false and lovely modesty. I can recall the names I'll miss. In the particle of me that cares for this. I betrayed those little atoms with a kiss. And if you still don't like my song. Then you can just go to hell. I don't care if I'm right or wrong or if. my typewriter can spell. But I cannot promise you I've said ""goodbye"". to childish things. There's still some pretty insults left. and such sport in threatening. My poor belated chastity fell foul. of grown up games. With false and lovely modesty. I can recall the names I'll miss. In the particle of me that cares for this. I betrayed those little atoms with a kiss. And for the sake of clarity. They are ""faith"", ""hope"", and ""charity"". In the particle of me that cares for this. I betrayed those little atoms with a kiss."
little goody two shoes,"You can take a powder, you can take a drink. You can keep the shrink and the kitchen sink. You can write my name in heaven in invisible ink. Just leave a feeling when there's no time to think. Little goody two shoes is here to clinch. You can miss by a mile or you can miss by an inch. Don't move a muscle, baby, don't even flinch. Or little goody two shoes will feel the pinch. You can tear me under, you can give me lip. You can tear me over, you can give me the slip. You can take off everything or tear me off a strip. With a bullet in the chamber and another in the clip. Little goody two shoes is here to clinch. You can miss by a mile or you can miss by an inch. Don't move a muscle, baby, don't even flinch. Or little goody two shoes will feel the pinch. Just when you thought you got what you deserved. Just when it's time to stop trying. A voice says, ""Boy, have you got a nerve--. Why do you have to keep crying and crying?"". You can take me outside, you can take me apart. You can take me upstairs, you can take me to heart. You can take the decision that it's time to depart. Don't try to stop me when you told me to start. Little goody two shoes is here to clinch. You can miss by a mile or you can miss by an inch. Don't move a muscle, baby, don't even flinch."
little palaces,"In Chocolate Town all the trains are painted brown. On the silver paper of the wrapper. There's a dapper little man. And he wears a wax moustache. That he twists with nicotine fingers. As he drops his cigarette ash. And someone comes and sweeps it up. And then he doffs his cap. And there's a rat in someone's bedroom. And they're shutting someone's trap. And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces. And the doors swing back and forward, from the past into the present. And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent.. And they're moving problem families from the South up to the North,. Mother's crying over some soft soap opera divorce,. And you say you didn't do it, but you know you did of course,. And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces.. It's like shouting in a matchbox, filled with plasterboard and hope,. Like a picture of Prince William in the arms of John the Pope.. There's a world of good intentions, and pity in their eyes,. The sedated homes of England, are theirs to vandalize.. So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,. And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.. And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.. You're the twinkle in your daddy's eye, a name you spray and scribble,. You made the girls all turn their heads, and in turn they made you miserable.. To be the heir apparent, to the kingdom of the invisible.. So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,. And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.."
little savage,I would have waited all my life. Just to make love out of something other than spite. But the beauty is the beast you're baiting. Should really be worth the waiting. You do something very special to. Mr. Average. Now the lamb lies with the lion. He's just a little savage. And so you turn your back on me. And all the hot air that only echoes stale tobacco. Actions speak louder now than words. By just a fraction. What's the use of saying I love you whe I'm drinking to distraction. We save our sanity. By saying such and such. After all its been discussed. You say you must be touched. (chorus).
little triggers,"Little triggers that you pull with your tongue.. Little triggers. I don't wanna be hung up, strung up,. when you don't call up.. Little sniggers on your lips.. Little triggers in your grip.. Little triggers. My hand on your hip.. Thinkin' all about those censored sequences,. worryin' about the consequences,. waiting until I come to my senses.. Better put it all in present tenses.. Worryin' about the common decency. when it is only a question of frequency. when you say O.K. But I gotta cheek to be."
living in paradise,"I don't like those other guys looking at your curves. I don't like you walking round with physical jerks. Everything they say and do is getting on my nerves. Soon the will be lucky to be picking up the perks. 'Cause when they pull the shutters down. and throw up in the dark,. they'll find that all the dogs outside. bite much worse than they bark.. Here we are living in paradise,. living in luxury.. Oh, the thrill is here but it won't last long. You better have your fun before it moves along. And you're already looking for another,. fool like me.. I call you Betty Felon 'cause you are a pretty villain. And I think that I should tell them that you'd. make a pretty killing. 'Cause meanwhile up in heaven they are waiting at the gate. saying 'We'd always knew you'd make it,. didn't think you'd come this late'.. And now it's much too dangerous to stop what you've begun. When everyone in paradise carries a gun. [Chorus]. Later in the evening when arrangements are made,. I'll be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door.. 'Cause I'm the first to know whenever the plans are laid. that never go further than floor to floor.. You think that I don't know the boy that you're touching,. but I'll be at the video and I will be watching."
london's brilliant parade,"Outside my window. Not long before sleep arrives. They come with their sirens. And they sweep away all the boys. Busy draining the joy from their lives. They never said their prayers out loud. And while I'm dreaming. There's a passing motor car. That broadcasts a popular song. And a girl appears to be saying. ""Do you think that I'm going to go far?"". FIRST CHORUS:. Just look at me. I'm having the time of my life. Or something quite like it. When I'm walking out and about. In London's brilliant parade. She's one of those girls that you just can't place. You feel guilty desiring such an innocent face. But of course they knew that when they cast her. Along with the red Routemaster. And the film takes place in an MGB. And a perfect re-creation of ""The Speakeasy"". Everybody looks happy and twisted. Though she probably never existed. For old times' sake. Don't let me awake. I wouldn't want you to walk across Hungerford Bridge. Especially at twilight. Looking through the bolts and the girders. Into the water below. You'll never find your answer there. They sounded the ""all-clear"" in the occidental bazaar. They used to call Oxford Street. Now the bankrupt souls in the city. Are finally tasting defeat. SECOND CHORUS:. Don't look at me. I'm having the time of my life. Or something quite like it. When I'm walking out and about. In London's brilliant parade. When I'm walking out and about. In London's brilliant parade. From the gates of St. Mary's, there were horses in Olympia. And a trolley bus in Fulham Broadway. The lions and the tigers in Regents Park. Couldn't pay their way. And now they're not the only ones. At the Hammersmith Palais. In Kensington and Camden Town. There's a part that I used to play;. The lovely Diorama is really part of the drama, I'd say."
long journey home,"(Composed: Elvis Costello/Paddy Moloney). If on every ocean the ship is a throne. And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown. Then I could believe that I'm bound to find. A better life than I left behind. But as you ascend the ladder. Look out below where you tread. For the colors bled as they overflowed. Red, white and blue. Green, white and gold. So I had to leave from my country of birth. As for each child grown tall. Another lies in the earth. And for every rail we laid in the loam. There's a thousand miles of the long journey home. But as you ascend the ladder. Look out below where you tread. For the colors bled as they overflowed. Red, white and blue. Green, white and gold."
lost in the stars,"(Kurt Weill/Maxwell Anderson). Before Lord God made the sea and the land. He held all the stars in the palm of his hand. And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand. And one little star fall alone. Then the Lord God hunted through the wild night air. For the little dark star in the wind down there. And he stated and promised he'd take special care. So it wouldn't get lost again. Now, man don't mind if the stars grow dim. And the clouds blow over and darken him. So long as the Lord God's watching over him. Keeping track how it all goes on. But I've been walking through the night and the day. Till my eyes get weary and my hair turns grey. And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away. Forgetting the promise that we heard him say. And we're lost out here in the stars. Little stars, big stars. Blowing through the night. And we're lost out here in the stars. Little stars, big stars. Blowing through the night. And we're lost out here in the stars."
lovable,(chorus). It's going round the town. It's going round the town. It's going round the town. You're so lovable. My baby gave me notice to quit. I just can't get used to it. She broke my little heart in two. Now somebody else is being the same old you. (chorus). My baby has Egyptian eyes. And a wicked look beyond compare. If you thought I was a fool for you. Then I must be a bigger fool for her. (chorus). He'd turn the flowers of springtime into a wreath. He says he'd love you eternally. I say please please can't you keep it brief. They say they're going to bury you. Because you're so lovable. Put your money where your mouth was. You're so lovable. Each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam. You're so lovable. The toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom. You're so lovable. You're so sweet. You're so honest. You say `I'll be true to you boy'. But I won't promise. Then you say you love me. Then you show me. As you lie there so lifelike below me.
love field,You lie so unfolded. In a love field. With your contempt for any modesty. In a love field. In a love field. In a love field. You yield with your lips still sealed. In a love field. Lost in a sea of imaginary women. Everything you'd want. from the dawn to the dimming. Breath comes sharp and heart beats faster. In a love field. Cold ground for a pillow. Under a blanket of stars. In a love field. In a love field. In a love field. Headlights that startled. This embrace of hours. In a love field. In a crooked house. Where things can be arranged. You think you're different from the rest. But you don't see how you've changed. Under an archway. On a road of white linen. In a love field. Feel the anxious rhythm of a functional stranger. In a love field. In a love field. In a love field. She's so tense but it's never mentioned. In a love field.
love for sale,"When the only sound on the empty street. Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet. That belong to a lonesome cop. I open shop. When the moon so long has been gazing down. On the wayward ways of a wayward town. That a smile becomes a smirk. I go to work. Love for sale. Appetizing young love for sale. Love that's fresh and still unspoiled. Love that's only slightly soiled. Love for sale. Who will buy? Who would like to sample my supply?. Who's prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise?. Love for sale. Let the poets pipe of love in their childish ways. I know every kind of love better far than they. If you want the thrill of love, I've been through the mill of love. Old love, new love. Every kind but true love. For sale. Appetizing young love for sale. If you want to buy my wares. Follow me and climb the stairs. Love for sale. Love for sale."
love for tender,"You won't take my love for tender. You can put your money where your mouth is. But you're so unsure. I could be a miser or a big spender. But you might get much more than you bargained for. Check in on a checkmate. Grassing on a classmate. So beautiful and fortunate. You're the one who hates to love. But he's the one who loves to hate. He can fix you all for good. Because he is the neighbourhood. You can get money for blood. Blood money for doing no good. Better tell me now, have you made your selection?. Are you ready for correction?. Cause the wages of sin are an expensive infection. It'll make you bankrupt. Better pay up now, don't interrupt. So in love, I'm so sincere. Just like a well-known financier. You know I've never been corrupt. I'll pay you a compliment. And you'll think I am innocent. You can total up the balance sheet. And never know if I'm a counterfeit. You won't take my love for tender...."
love went mad,I've looked at it every way I can. From under and above. And every chance I've had. My love went mad. Love went mad love went mad. You you feel like I feel?. Do you have a heart?. DO YOU HAVE A HEART OF IRON AND STEEL?. Are you a man now you wear a man's hat?. Are you a man now or are you a rat?. You go to church quiet as a mouse. You're a big cheese now in the workhouse. With these vulgar fractions of the treble clef. I wish you luck with a capital 'F'. A self-made mug is hard to break. A silent partner in someone else's mistake. Every day goes by without a hitch. YOU FEEL THE URGE BECOMING AN ITCH. The boys in blue are hard to catch. They're busy turning Piccadilly. Into Brands Hatch. But with your fingers in your ears. Feeling bright as a button. Thinking 'THANK GOD THERE'LL BE NO MORE. LAMB DRESSED AS MUTTON'. Playing family favourites on a tissue and a comb. DYING A THOUSAND DEATHS. IN THE SAFETY OF YOUR OWN HOME.
lover's walk,"I won't walk with my head bowed. (Be on) Beyond caution where lovers walk. My love walks where three's a crowd. Beyond caution where lovers walk. Lovers walk, lovers scramble. Beyond caution where the lovers walk. Lovers step, shuffle and gamble. Beyond caution where lovers walk. Lovers trip, lovers stumble. Lovers dip, lovers fumble. Lovers lip where love has crumbled. Beyond caution where lovers walk. Lovers strut, lovers stroll, lovers leap. Lovers late, lovers wait. Making promises that they can't keep. Lovers link up arm and arm. Lovers slink up, lovers charm. Lovers drink up and come to harm. Beyond caution where lovers walk. Love is gone and it's no one's fault. Love has stopped here, lovers halt. Lovers don't walk, lovers run. Will you look what love has done. Will you look what love has done. Will you look what love has done. Beyond caution where lovers walk. Now love's limping on a lover's crutch. Looking for a hand with a personal touch. Beyond caution where lovers walk. . ."
lovers that never were,"(McCartney/MacManus). I have always needed somebody, girl. But I close the doors to keep out the world. But for you. I would be here all alone. Locked in a photograph. All of the clocks have run down. Lover beware. We'll be the lovers that never were. I hang patiently on every word you send. Will we ever be much more than just friends?. As for you. You sit there playing this game. You keep me waiting. When all of the clocks have run down. All over the world. We'll be the lovers that never were. For as long as the sun shines. In somebody's eyes. I believe in you, baby. So don't tell me lies. For as long as the trees. Throw down blossoms and leaves. I know there will be. A parade of unpainted dreams. And I know, dear. How much it's going to hurt. If you still refuse to get your hands dirty. So you. You must tell me something...I love you. Say goodbye or anything. All of the clocks have run down. Time's at an end. If we can't be lovers we'll never be friends. For as long as the sun shines. In somebody's eyes. I believe in you, baby. So don't tell me lies. For as long as the trees. Throw down blossoms and leaves. I know there will be. A parade of unpainted dreams."
luxembourg,"Dressed up like a dog's dinner. Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth. If this is a dog's life. Then you're the cat's claws. They hire out your sons. And hire out your daughters. The man from abroad says he's already bought her. And now you look like a lover but you're only a tourist. Chorus:. You're either talking or yawning. You didn't listen to a thing you heard. Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg. You get over. You're worried by her body. She's worryin' about her bodily odour. You pull off. The pull over. You say that you love her when you really loathe her. Serves you right now she wants you to feed her and clothe her. Chorus. They're smiling sweetly while they're looking daggers. Kick you where it really matters. Send all your friends to Coventry. And look for your name in last night's obituaries. If you've got the Deutschmarks. If you've got the Yen, then. You get the shirt off her back and the clock off Big Ben. Somebody's soft touch. Struck all these bargains. In the drinking clubs with the council men making. plans to put lead back in their pencils again. Chorus."
man out of time,So this is where he came to hide. When he ran from you. In a private detective's overcoat. And dirty dead man's shoes. The pretty things of Knightsbridge. Lying for a minister of state. Is a far cry from the nod and wink. Here at traitor's gate. 'Cause the high heel he used to be has been ground down. And he listens for the footsteps that would follow him around. To murder my love is a crime. But will you still love. A man out of time. There's a tuppeny hapenny millionaire. Looking for a fourpenny one. With a tight grip on the short hairs. Of the public imagination. But for his private wife and kids somehow. Real life becomes a rumour. Days of dutch courage. Just three French letters and a German sense of humour. He's got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge. He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege. (chorus). The biggest wheels of industry. Retire sharp and short. And the after dinner overtures. Are nothing but an after thought. Somebody's creeping in the kitchen. There's a reputation to be made. Whose nerves are always on a knife's edge. Who's up late polishing the blade. Love is always scarpering or cowering or fawning. You drink yourself insensitive and hate yourself in the morning.
men called uncle,"Now there's newsprint all over your face. Well maybe that's why I can read you like a book. Just when I thought I was getting my taste to bite. I go and lose my appetite. Look at the man that you'd call uncle. They'd like to sink their teeth into you. For the pride and the pleasure. And the privilege of having you. If I say you're the one do you think that I'm serious. You get that kind of talk from older men. If I say I love you then I must be delirious. So why are you trying to put my temperature up again. Look at the man that you'd call uncle. Having a heart attack round your ankles. When you wake up with X-rated eyes. When you wake up still shaking. How can I apologize. As you check your effects and check your reflection. I'm so affected in the face of your affection. Look at the man that you'd call uncle. Having a heart attack round your ankles. I could swear, I could promise that I'll always be true to you. But we may not live to be so old. I could even say I'm going to do something new to you. Now the girls I see just leave me cold."
miracle man,"You never asked me what I wanted. You only asked me why.. I never thought that so much trouble was restin' on my reply,. I could say it was the nights when I was lonely. and you were the only one who'd come.. I could tell you that I like your sensitivity,. when you know it's the way that you walk.. Why do you have to say that there's always someone. who can do it better than I can?. But don't you think that I know that walking on the water. won't make me a miracle man?. Baby's gotta have the things she wants.. You know she's gotta have the things she loves.. She's got a ten-inch bamboo cigarette holder. and her black patent leather gloves.. And I'm doing everything just tryin' to please her,. even crawling around on all fours.. Oh, I thought by now that it was gonna be easy,. but she still seems to want for more.. (chorus). I hear they're givin' you a bad reputation. just because you've never been denied.. You try to say you've done it all before.. Baby, you know that you just get tired.. Yet everybody loves you so much, girl.. I just don't know how you stand the strain.. Oh, I, I'm the one who's here tonight,. and I don't wanna do it all in vain.. (chorus)."
mischievous ghost,"She came dancing right before my eyes. She said she'd came to warn me. Before it dawned on me. I went walking on the blank hillside. Where the sunset falls. Where the sunset dies. She gave me love, she told me lies. That most mischievous ghost. She was in disguise, she was in disguise, she was in disguise.. He started to whistle, they bought him a flute. He was talking in tongues, they swore he was mute. He scoffed and blasphemed, they said it was beautiful. Busted a button, they bought him a suitcase full. They coloured him cricket and laced him up tight. As he drew on their days resurrected his nights. He raved in the dark, he went out in a blaze. ""There you go,"" they said, ""he's good for nothing and lazy"". With scandal and shame they slandered his name. They told him to freeze, they damned him to roast. Disappointed that he passed away peacefully. Never [trying/dying] to be a mischievous ghost. They dug him up quick with a polish and lick. They powdered him up till he only looked sick. The hinge in his backbone would bend to applause. But his dancing was not quite as lively of course. These are the rewards immortality affords. Bullied and bribed and beaten to bliss. [Harrington slacks/Harrods in slacks] and tormental laments. Of going away and not being missed. With scandal and shame they slandered his name. They told him to freeze, they damned him to roast. Disappointed that he passed away peacefully. Never dying to be a mischievous ghost. With the green beer and the shamrock tattoos. Singing his songs of the battles we lose. And [when/will] you come home again so we can murder you. What would you do if they took his word. With forty-eight million to join in the toast. Move over my darling. Mischievous ghost. Mischievous ghost."
miss macbeth,"All the children testified that Miss Macbeth. wore a fishbone slide in her cobweb tresses. Her eyes were black like first foot coal, clutched as white as chalk-dust. Her fingers sweated india-ink and poison-pen letters. There is a hungry hanging tree, just below your bedroom window. You can hear her take a broom to beat out a tattoo on the ceiling. Her bloodless face ran red inside but was she. really evil, was she only pantomime. Now the chalk on the wall says that somebody. saves, that somebody's face has just been washed off the pavement. Into a puzzle where petrol will be poisoned by rain. Miss Macbeth saw her reflection. As confetti bled it's colours down the drain. Chorus:. And everyday she lives out another love song. It's a tearful lament of somebody done wrong. Well how can you miss what you've never possessed?. Miss Macbeth. Well we all should have known when the children paraded. They portrayed her in their fairytales, sprinkling Deadly Nightshade. And as they tormented her she rose to the bait. Even a scapegoat must have someone to hate. And everyday she lives out another love song. ""You're up there enjoying yourself, and I know it's wrong"". Well how can you miss what you've never possessed. Miss Macbeth. Sometimes people are just what they appear to be. With no redemption at all. We try to walk upright when we can't even crawl. Miss Macbeth has a gollywog she chucks under. the chin and she whispers to it tenderly Then sticks it on a pin. And It might be coincidence, but a boy down. the lane, that she said ""went white as he could do,"" then doubled over in pain."
miss mary,"Angels announce with trumpets. Crown you with jewels and stars. Hercules lives. Next door to Venus and Mars. Beside your pretty blue shoulder. something may trouble Jerome. Now that you're up with your friends. I know you'll never come home. Singing so babe, I know this song. Miss Mary I'm nothing without you. Everything I've done is wrong. Miss Mary I try not to doubt you. I walk in their brilliant parade. Banish the primitive gloom. Now I know where I can find you. Hung up in some Frenchman's room. Pitiful Magdalena for all to see. Must have been beautiful. So just show a little mercy to me. Hey babe, I sing this song. Miss Mary I'm nothing without you. Everything I've done is wrong. Miss Mary I try not to doubt you. There at the foot of your staircase. I stood to take in the scene. All the ashes of roses. The veined steps of marble. Purple, gold and green. Oh I wish you were my queen. They only want to possess you. Lock you away in a vault. Such a heavenly vision. And dress you up in blue. I guess it's not their fault. I know this song. Miss Mary I'm nothing without you. Everything I've done is wrong. Miss Mary I try not to doubt you. So babe, I sing this song. Miss Mary I'm nothing without you. Everything I've done is wrong. Miss Mary I try not to doubt you."
mistress and maid,"(McCartney/MacManus). She said, ""Come in, my dear,. You're looking tired tonight. Your bath is drawn, let me loosen your tie. And fix you your usual drink"". He settles back. Takes a magazine. Kicks off his shoes. As he studies the form. Of every appealing soubrette. But where are the flowers that he used to bring?. Every endearing remark. Reminds her of passionate promises. That he only made in the dark. In her bed. She wants to shout at the back of his head. Look at me, look at me, look at me. I'm afraid. See what it's come to. I'm just your mistress and maid. The wine is warm. But the dinner is cold. The look in his eye tells her it won't be long. Till the girls on the page come to life. And they'll get the flowers that he used to bring. With every endearing remark. And all of the passionate promises. He'll never fulfil in the dark. In their bed. She wants to shout at the back of his head. Look at me, look at me, now that I'm not afraid.. See what it's come to. I'm not your mistress and maid. See what it's come to. I'm not your mistress and maid."
monkey to man,"A long time ago, our point of view. Was broadcast by Mr. Bartholomew. And now the world is full of sorrow and pain. And it's time for us to speak up again. You're slack and sorry. Such an arrogant brood. The only purpose you serve is to bring us our food. We sit here staring at your pomp and pout. Outside the bars we use for keeping you out. You've taken everything that you wanted. Broke it up and plundered it and hunted. Ever since we said it. You went and took the credit. It's been headed this way since the world began. When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man. Monkey to Man. Every time man struggles and fails. He makes up some kind of fairytales. After all of the misery that he has caused. He denies he's descended from the dinosaurs. Points up to heaven with cathedral spires. All the time indulging in his base desires. Ever since we said it. He went and took the credit. It's been headed this way since the world began. When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man. Monkey to Man. Big and useless as he has become. With his crying statues and his flying bomb. Goes 'round acting like the chosen one. Excuse us if we treat him like our idiot cousin. He hangs up flowers and bells and rhymes. Hoping to hell someone's forgiven his crimes. Fills up the air with his pride and praise. He's a big disgrace to our beastly ways. In the fashionable nightclubs and finer precincts. Man uses words to dress up his vile instincts. Ever since we said it. He went and took the credit. It's been headed this way since the world began. When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man"
moods for moderns,Moods for moderns (x4). I get hit looking for a miss. I never thought that it would come to this. Moods for moderns (x4). Though we may never be the same again. I am so proud that you've been taken in vain. What if none of your dreams come true?. I can never run from you. There's never been a how d'you do. There's never been an ending. Soon you'll belong to someone else. And I will be your stranger just pretending. Moods for moderns. Memory lingers. I let you into. Foreign fingers. Moods for moderns (x4). I never thought that would see the day. I never thought that I would give you away. (Chorus). Moods for moderns. Let them break us. Strong and sudden. Foreign fingers.
motel matches,"Somewhere in the distance I can hear ""Who Shot Sam?"". This is my conviction, that I am an innocent man. Though you say I'm unkind. I'm being as nice as I can. Boys everywhere, fumbling with the catches. I struck lucky with motel matches. Falling for you without a second look. Falling out of your open pocketbook. Giving you away like motel matches. I wake with the siren in an emergency. Though your mind is full of love. In your eyes there is a vacancy. And you know what I'll do. When the light outside changes from red to blue. Chorus."
mouth almighty,This town belongs to you and your tricks of confidence. All the pavements for miles around are littered with your footprints. Now every girl I get close to seems to be wearing your perfume. And the clock strikes the letters of your name. Both midnight and noon. But I used to shoot my mouth off. Till you'd had enough of me. Once or twice nightly. I know I've got my faults. And among them I CAN'T CONTROL MY TONGUE. But if you didn't believe me. Why did you have to leave me. With my mouth almighty. Mouth almighty that's what I've got. Mouth almighty telling you what's what. Mouth almighty. I wish I'd never opened my mouth almighty. SO I THREW AWAY THE ROSE AND HELD ONTO THE THORN. Crawling round with my crooner cufflinks and my calling card cologne. But the realization of being replaced starts to tell tales across my face. Without a soul to talk to or a hair out of place. .
mr. & mrs. hush,"I tripped through a house. Of mirrors. Distorted my suspicions and fears. (I heard a whisper). There is a place where those. Secrets begin. (They had a list). I gave my name and they invited. Me in. (But here's the twist). A sign flickered and it started. To flash. ""Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Hush"". Haven't you tired of that. Darkness yet?. Didn't you cry your heart out?. It's only a dream. What is it about love you. Can't accept?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. To be. Mr. and Mrs. Hush. But it was something I just. Couldn't understand. Until I slipped my finger into. The band. Just think what those eyes. Might betray. Stare hard and now don't. Look away. Haven't you tired of that. Darkness yet?. Didn't you cry your heart out?. It's only a dream. What is it about love you. Can't accept?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. To be. Mr. and Mrs. Hush. I don't know if I'm deep down. Right inside her heart. Or outside her door. I don't know if I have the key. To either. Uncertain if I should take. Her hand or leave her. (I thought I saw her). It's a game of blindfold and bluff. (I thought I saw her). You know I love you. Is it ever enough?. (I thought I saw her). Oh, what did I know. (I thought I saw her). Heigh-ho and there you go. (I thought I saw her). A voice that caresses and heels. Like spurs. (I thought I saw her). What if you walked in with some. Other fella. (I thought I saw her). Heat is rising. And red is the colour. (I thought I saw her). Green is the colour of my true. Love's eyes. (I thought I saw her). And green is the colour of. Those jealous disguises. Haven't you tired of that. Darkness yet?. Didn't you cry your heart out?. It's only a dream. What is it about love you. Can't accept?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. Are you ready?. To be. Mr. and Mrs. Hush"
mr. feathers,"They looked. At her this way. Every since. She was a girl. Mr. Feathers. Mr. Feathers. The echo. In every smile. That would curl. Into a leer. Oh, my dear. (Oh, my dear). Mr. Feathers is near. (Oh, my dear). The counter is foreign. Something is spoiling. It's really appalling. You pleased. And you promised. You never saw it through. Nobody knows. Tthe damage that we do. Do you carry it with you?. She passed him out. In the street. He suddenly seems so frail. As her fast heart beat. She should kick him anyway. Sharpen her nails. For eyes that stray. Where hands. Should never stray. She thought. She was wanted. Ever since. She was a girl. Mr. Feathers. Mr. Feathers. The kindness. In every smile. That would curl. Into a sneer. Oh, my dear. Mr. Feathers is near. Her lover is calling. Something is spoiling. It's really appalling. You pleased. And you promised. You never saw it through. Nobody knows. The damage that we do. The damage that we do"
must you throw dirt in my face,"What is it that brings you to this part of town. Curiosity, conscience or fate. I know it's not love. Cause I once gave you love. And all you showed me was the gate. I got a feeling you've come back. To just rub it in. And to really put me in my place. You've already but big old tears in my eyes. Must you throw dirt in my face. Must you keep telling me that you've got a new love. I don't need you to remind me. Must you keep telling me how I look so lonely. And my better days are behind me. Must you keep showing me pictures of him. Boasting of his warm embrace. You've already put big old tears in my eyes. Must you throw dirt in my face. You've already left me. And broken my heart. Told me how much you don't want me. Believe me I'm happier when we're apart. Why must you come back now to haunt me. Must you keep showing me pictures of him. Boasting of his warm embrace. You've already put big old tears in my eyes. Must you throw dirt in my face. You've already put big old tears in my eyes. Must you throw dirt in my face."
my brave face,"(McCartney/MacManus). My brave, my brave, my brave face. I've been living in style. Unaccustomed as I am. To the luxury life. I've been hitting the town. And it didn't hit back. I've been doing the rounds. Unaccustomed as I am. To the time on my hands. Now I don't have to tell anybody. When I'm gonna get back. Ever since you went away I've had the sentimental inclination not to change a single thing. As I pull the sheet back on the bed I want to go bury my head in your pillow. Now that I'm alone again. I can't stop breaking down again. The simplest things set me off again. Take me to that place. Where I can find my brave face. Where I can find my brave face. My brave, my brave, my brave face. I've been living a lie. Unaccustomed as I am. To the work of a housewife. I been breaking up dirty dishes. And been throwing them away. Ever since you left I have been trying to compose a ""Baby, would you please come home"" note meant for you. As I clear away another untouched TV dinner from the table I made for two. Now that I'm alone again. I can't stop breaking down again. The simplest things set me off again. Take me to that place. Where I can find my brave face. Where I can find my brave face.

my dark life,"She says nobody wants to believe. You're the same as everyone.. What makes me unique?. My Dark Life. There was a kink in the world. Sent that statue tumbling. An invitation east. So we can watch it all crumbling. She came off like light and so softly she spoke:. ""You don't know, no you don't know about my dark life"". And you think you're a guest, you're a tourist at best. Peering into the corners of your dark life. Now that you tear your dreams from consumptive ballerinas. She'd stand on tiptoes for you in a grey and tattered tutu. She stays where she is because of voyeurs like these. With an accusative look that says. My Dark Life. Robber men await you then in each beguiling alley. To shake you and to pierce you and remind you of. My Dark Life. Enter the pious elite, in their preening finery. And bang the tambourine. They're dining on rice paper scenery. See how the villain attracts envious glances from everyone. She's waitressing by day. It doesn't bring in much money now. And his strong concealed arms set off bells and alarms. In the strangest locations of. My Dark Life. But the fantasy slipped as he tipped her in cigarettes. She tries to smile very graciously when she wants to kill him. Now the victory is sweet, you'll get down on your knees. It's the perfect position for kissing western leather. So they came from Ugly Texas and from Nameless Tennessee. From Peculiar Missouri and from places closer to me.. All the cream of heartless England, cheered the carnival is over. There are remnants of red army bandsmen. Played ""America The Beautiful""."
my funny valentine,"My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine. You make me smile with my heart. Your looks are laughable, unphotographable. But you're my favourite work of art. Is your figure less than Greek ?. Is your mouth a little weak ?. When you open it to speak. Are you smart ?. Don't change a hair for me. Not if you care for me. Stay little valentine, stay. Each day is Valentine's day."
my little blue window,"This is a calling card. Maybe it will be a farewell note. The poison fountain pen now requires the antidote. But if I avert your gaze. And I should become a shrinking flower. Just punch me on the arm. This could be our finest hour. 'Til now this was my view. But I'm counting on you. How am I ever going to make you see?. Nothing in this ugly world comes easily. I want you to be.... My lovely hooligan. Come by and smash my pane. 'Til I can see right through. My little blue window. This is a fingerprint. Maybe you will feel a fond caress. But when you start to speak. Are you tempted to confess?. Well, I was a gloomy soul. Never thought I'd see a brighter day. The dark interior. Blows those silver clouds away. 'Til now this was my view. But I'm counting on you. How am I ever going to make you see?. Nothing in this ugly world comes easily. I want you to be.... My lovely hooligan. Come by and smash my pane. 'Til I can see right through"
my mood swings,"She was smitten from the first. By a curious fellow. She said I love the way you talk. And with a flounce she then announces. I love the way that you pronounce it: ""Marshmallow"". So she liked to sing along. To her favourite song. From the year that she was born. She had mysterious affairs (?) (not sure this line is right). Until she woke up in the '80's. CHORUS:. So speak to me. Just like you should. And then you can say those wicked things. And if you want. We'll make it good. Before my mood swings. Well he looked like one of those. Who would take off his clothes. Like he would peel a tangerine. No-one's been known to decline this. Until I've found out what your sign is."
my new haunt,"My New Haunt. Gives me everything I want. My New Haunt. Gives me everything I want. And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind. If she turns out to be crazy in time. Bring me black strap molasses. Light me a burning witch. Bring me my bristle brushes. Bring me my tar and pitch. Bring me my feather pillow. And I'll unpick the stitch. We've lived too well. Too long. So long. So strong. My New Haunt. Brings me everything I want. And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind. If she turns out to be faithless in time. My New Haunt. Sometimes disappears. Then comes back in the night. And whispers in my ears. Saying ""Don't you know you little fool. You've nothing to fear. I'll tell you everything you want to know. Everything you want to hear"". And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind. Raise up that flaming torch. Watch as the ships approach. An invitation on her lips. The homeless, tempest-tossed, she grips. Make her beautiful. Make her dutiful and rich. Sing me a love song. So long. So strong. My New Haunt. Has just been repossessed. And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind. if I have to guess my next address. I'm out on the horizon. Just as the sun was rising. First rays bestow a kiss. So you would never guess. I'm sailing off a precipice. Dragons and gold down in the hold. Burning leaves and spices choking back the stench of piss. My New Haunt. Requires a coat of paint. And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind. If the walls are peeling. And the ceiling is revealing the stars out there reeling. My New Haunt. Sometimes disappears. Comes back in the night. And whispers in my ears. Saying ""Don't you know you little fool. You've nothing to fear. I'll tell you everything you want to know. Everything you want to hear"". And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind. At the end of the working day. He's tired of kneeling, and praying. ""As I lay down to die"". I can't remember why. Up on the silent screen. A cowboy ropes a trick. And in the second feature. Some lovely creature saved by a yankee dick. Make her beautiful. Make her dutiful and rich. Sing me a love song. So long. So strong. My New Haunt. The shiver of a chill. And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind. Start making babies. Beat out those bayonets. Stop making bullets. Reverse the planets. Pick all my pockets. Cut off those bracelets. Have you no remorse?. Peel off your corsets. Of course"
my science fiction twin,"My science fiction twin. Is doing better than expected. He captured a little blonde trophy wife. Who's really very well connected. And when he calls home with his alibi. She says ""Is this really necessary?"". But she knows that a man can't be a man. Unless he's punishing his secretary. He sips in the glow of a '61 vintage. Just as the day is dimming. With every intention of surrendering. To fifty-foot women. Who put the fascination back into my science fiction twin. My science fiction twin. Decided to become invisible. He has my eyes, my face, my voice. But he's only happy when I'm miserable. The words flew from his mouth. And they were gently gathered by reporters. Trying to frame his once infamous flame. With tattered pictures of her daughter. Her hair is all made out of porcupine. Her figure is fantastic. But as you know, they corrupted her. So they're being sarcastic. Who put the fascination back into my science fiction twin. He'll scream and shout. Everything is working out just as he predicted. Pride and position in the gallery of attempted people. Oh and the pain is so sweet. Better stamp his little feet. And you'll even have time to pity me. How can you feel content?. You wonder where this fellow went. My science fiction twin. Escorted by his lovely nieces. Filled up his purse dictating verse. While painting masterpieces. His almost universal excellence. Is starting to disturb me. They asked how in the world he does all these things. And he answered ""Superbly"". He's trapped in his own parallel dimension. That's why I'm so forgiving. But how could I possibly forget to mention those fifty-foot women. Who put the fascination back into my science fiction twin."
my shoes keep walking back to you,I might say that I don't care. Hold my head up in the air. Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call. But when the day is through. That's when my heartaches start anew. And that's when I miss you most of all. And my arms keep reaching for you. And my eyes keep searching for you. And my lips keep calling for you. And my shoes keep walking back to you. No matter how much I pretend. I wish I had you back again. 'Cause nothin' means half as much as you. My world just seemed to die. The day you said goodbye. And I can't forget no matter what I do. And my arms keep reaching for you. And my eyes keep searching for you. And my lips keep calling for you. And my shoes keep walking back to you. . .
my thief,"When I go to sleep, you become my thief. Why don't you steal what you can keep?. But you won't let me be. You break into my dreams. And every day seems different. Sometimes I pretend you'll come back again. And you'll console the heart you stole. Have pity on the man. Who knows that you have gone. And has begun to break down. I feel almost possessed. So long as I don't lose this glorious distress then. You can take all I have left. I know it's over. If you can't be my lover. Be my thief. I'm so drowsy now, I'll unlock the door. What fades in time will hurt much more. So here's that happy scene. Where you come back to me. It's only found in fiction. I feel almost possessed. So long as I don't lose this glorious distress then. You can take all I have left. I know it's over. If you can't be my lover. Be my thief. ""I didn't lead you on,. But there will always be. A little larceny in everyone. So hush and don't you cry. I'm trying to be kind. Because I have a perfect alibi""."
my three sons,"Day is dawning. Almost sounded like a warning. Wind was rushing through the trees almost falling. I never thought that I’d become. The proud father of my three sons. Years of fragment. Between the shame and the sentiment. For all the years that I might have been absent. I can’t do what can’t be undone. Oh no, my three songs. I love you more than I can say. What I give to one, the other cannot take away. I bless the day you came to be. With everything that is left to me. Here’s your pillow. Go to sleep and I will follow. May you never have anymore sorrows. That’s not something that you can count upon. Still I want it for my three sons. My, my, my three sons. Deep in the night I turn cold and sick. But I only curse arithmetic. I bless the day that you came to be. With everything that is left to me. Day is closing. Old men and infants are dosing. That’s the kind of life I’ve chosen. To see what I’ve become. The humble father of my three sons. The humbled father of my three sons"

needle time,"I wish that I didn't hate you. Least not as much as I do. And squander all my contempt for. A little nothing like you. Liars like you are ten-a-penny. Women would slap you, if you knew any. Sometimes I feel just like committing a crime. I've got this suitcase of phony wisdom to dispense. These twenty-seven or so years. You'd think I (would have) made them some cents. Now they want me fingerprinted. Like I was smuggling drugs. While the government does deals with the most convenient thugs. Sometimes I feel just like committing a crime. It's Needle Time. I'm trying not to despise you with a passion that is hard to extinguish. Or maybe I really love you. Although it's hard to distinguish. I wish I could be. A little more like a saint is. Forgiving those who trespass against us. Sometimes I feel just like committing a crime. I started talking nonsense, just like I did to begin with. Around the time I tired of those sour English. Sometimes I feel just like committing a crime. It's Needle Time"
new amsterdam,"You're sending me tulips mistaken for lilies. You give me your lip after punching me silly. You turned my head till it rolled down the brain drain. If I had any sense now I wouldn't want it back again. New Amsterdam it's become much too much. Till I have the possession of everything she touches. Till I step on the brakes to get out of her clutches. Till I speak double dutch to a real double duchess. Down on the mainspring, listen to the tick tock. Clock all the faces that move in on your block. Twice shy and dog tired because you've been bitten. Everything you say now sounds like it was ghost-written. Chorus. Back in London they'll take you to heart after a little while. Though I look right at home I still feel like an exile. Somehow I found myself down at the dockside. Thinking of the old days of Liverpool and Rotherhithe. The transparent people who live on the other side. Living a life that is almost like suicide. Chorus."
new lace sleeves,Bad lovers face to face in the morning. Shy apologies and polite regrets. Slow dances that left no warning of. Outraged glances and indiscreet yawning. Good manners and bad breath get you nowhere. Even presidents have newspaper lovers. Ministers go crawling under covers. She's no angel. He's no saint. They're all covered up with white washed grease paint. And you say.... Chorus:. The teacher never told you anything but white lies. But you never see the lies. And you believe. Oh you know you have been captured. You feel so civilized. And you look so pretty in your new lace sleeves. The salty lips of the socialite sisters. With their continental fingers that have. never seen working blisters. Oh I know they've got their problems. I wish I was one of them. They say daddy's coming home soon. With his sergeant stripes and his Empire mug and spoon. No more fast buck. And when are they gonna learn their lesson. When are they gonna stop all of these victory processions. And you say.... Chorus.
next time 'round,"As I stepped out upon the landing my heart was already down the stairs. She's in the bedroom with that boy of hers. Though her face is creased and her eyes seem strange. There's a second-hand emotion on battered forty-five. My tears were never enough to keep that girl alive. Now she seems contrite will she make the change. Chorus: The next time 'round. The next time 'round. You'll be someone else's baby. But I'll be underground. The Next Time 'Round. Then you took two steps forward and then one step on your back. Now it's a future for me and you that I lack. You'll be the one who'll stands out in the dark. Even when you're all dressed in black. Chorus. You've got something I want now. And I've got something I can't hide. I've got too much love for you now. Have you got too much pride. Sometimes I name and number all the things you gave to me. Your elastic love, this velvet-line purgatory. You used to take the breath out of me. Now I think you'll be the death of me. Chorus. You'll be in some sputnik baby. But I'll be underground. The Next Time 'Round."

Once he glanced at the jackets of some paperbacks.. Now he's read every one.. He's such a drag.. He's not insane.. It's just that everybody. has to feel his pain.. There's gonna be no dancing when they get home.. He's getting down on his knees.. He finds that her brother's not so easy to please,. After all, his nights were just a paper striptease.. She's caught it like some disease.. If he says no dancing,. there's gonna be no dancing on my own.. She can't even speak to him.. He can't face her now.. He says ""Even though I wanna shake your hand,. all I ever do is bow.. so know you see. how can it be?. Why can't you give me anythin' but sympathy?"". There's gonna be no dancing when they get home.. No dancing,. there's gonna be no dancing,."
no hiding place,"In the not very distant future. When everything will be free. There won't be any cute secrets. Let alone any novelty. You can say anything you want to. In your fetching cloak of anonymity. Are you feeling out of breath now?. In your desperate pursuit of infamy. Two lovers rocking up and down. In an elevator. 15 minutes later. They'll make a killing in the market. They knew how to work it. On that close circuit. My, my, it's a terrible disgrace. You'll find these days that there's. No hiding place. How proud are you. You have the knack. You're howling in a vacuum. Whatever I said about you. I didn't say it behind your back. I paid for my immortal sins. I know the enemy within you. As it seems these days. There is no hiding place. Next time someone wants to hurt you. Or set alight your effigy. Don't call on me to help you out. Don't come crying to me sympathy. You stay there with your daubs. And scratches. While I summon up the red machine. I'll handing someone matches. And carrying a can of kerosene. Walk up to me. And say what you said. See how brave you are. When I'm about this far away. You sit in judgment and bitch. Well, baby that's rich. You're nothing but a snitch. My, my, it's a terrible disgrace. You'll find these days that there's. No hiding place"
no wonder,"I stole a glance at my reflection,. Though these days I tend to hurry by.. How pale the rose of my complexion,. How strange the knowing look that's in my eye.. But when the springtime was ablaze,. You took my hand, you held my gaze.. There is no wonder there,. I learned my lesson well,. No need to wonder where that girl has gone.. There is a secret no one knows,. I set my face, I changed my clothes. I dreamed I stood as you were passing,. Just as the horse-drawn carriage sped away.. Of petticoats in puddles dragging,. And my highbutton boots were splashed with clay.. But when the summer was in flame,. You broke your word, denied my name.. There is no wonder there, etc.. But as the winter drags along,. It blurs your sense of right and wrong.. There is no wonder there, etc.."
north,The East has that Englishmen. And the rising sun. The West has the open plains. And how they were won. On Independence Day. For all it's worth. You can ring those southern belles. I'm going. North. Up were the rushing rivers run and salmon leap. I could even get there in my sleep. Give me the ice and snow. Time to go.... North. So run up a banner and we'll stand underneath. You gave me a starry flag. For one with a leaf. I'm on the borderline. I jump back and forth. There's nothing to stop me now. I'm heading.... North. Up where the polar bears and moose and geese will play. And some of them address you en franÃ§ais. Give me the ice and snow. Time to go.... North. And so I must leave you all. Alas and alack. And though we are parting now. I'll always come back. So as the compass points. That's where I'll be. But if you could only see. The perfection of.... North. It's something I will always carry in my heart. A place when dreams begin and life can start. Who cares what people know?. Let me go....
nothing clings like ivy,"Nothing clings like Ivy. Frightened by the dark. Though she cuts deep. It never leaves a mark. No one quite like Ivy. Ever gets it straight. What she believes. She won't negotiate. All the words of tenderness. That never quite got through. She said ""You know how young girls are. From my contempt for you."". Outside in the hollow. She may dare herself. For there may be. A serpent in the grass. Nothing clings like Ivy. Trying to scare herself. And it may strike or. Wait for her to pass. All the words of tenderness. That she never possessed. ""So what's the use of promises?. I had my fingers crossed."". All the words of tenderness. That never quite got through. She said, ""I laughed behind your back. When I told them to you."". Nothing clings like Ivy. Frightened by the dark. Though she cuts deep. It never leaves a mark"
"o, mistress mine","(Harle/Shakespeare). O, mistress mine. Where are you roaming?. O, stay and hear. Your true love's coming. That can save both high and low. Trip no further pretty sweeting. Journeys end in lovers meeting. Every wise man's son doth know. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Trip no further pretty sweeting. Journeys end in lovers meeting. Every wise man's son doth know. What is love?. 'Tis not hereafter. Present mirth. Hath present laughter. What's to come is still unsure. In delay there lies no plenty. Then come kiss me sweet and twenty. It's a stuff will not endure."
oh well,The ink is running. The words are taught. I'm sitting helpless with my paper and charts. I had to follow my passion. Oh well. I don't get paid that much for all I deserve. To waste a sentence or shatter my nerves. I had to follow my passion. Oh well. Sometimes I long to run outside. I'd give it all up but it's my pride. Oh well. Oh well. I had a dream once or so I thought. I'd be a pilot or an astronaut. I had a dream like that until I found. Even an astronaut goes into the ground. Life is just passing us bye-bye. Oh well. Oh well. Oh well
oliver's army,Don't start that talking. I could talk all night. my mind was sleep walking. While I was putting the world to rights. Call careers information. Have you got yourself an occupation. Olivers Army is here to stay. Olivers army is on their way. And I would rather be anywhere else. But here today. There was a checkpoint charlie. He didn't crack a smile. But it's no laughing party. When you've been on the murder mile. All it takes is one itchy trigger. One more widow one less white nigger. Olivers Army is here to stay. Olivers army is on their way. And I would rather be anywhere else. But here today. Hong Kong is up for grabs. London is full of Arabs. We could be in Palestine. Overrun by a Chinese line. With the boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne. But there's no danger. It's a professional career. Though it could be arranged. With just a word in Mr. Churchill's ear. If you're out of luck or out of work. We could send you to Johannesburg. Olivers Army is here to stay. Olivers army is on their way. And I would rather be anywhere else. But here today.
opportunity,"Born in the middle of a second big baby boom. Those noisy boys just might have spoken up too soon. Now I'm looking for a little girl, I wonder where she's gone. Big money for families having more than one. Opportunity, opportunity. This is your big opportunity. They shop around. follow you without a sound. Whatever you do now. Don't turn around. Whatever happened to the pride of the nation?. They say, ""just wait until you break formation"". She was sitting pretty on a velvet cushion. But her bedroom eyes were like a button she was pushing. She said, ""When they get to Dover they'll be be taking over"". I said I'd come to her defense and then she pulled me over. Chorus. I'm in the foxhole, I'm down in the trench. I'd be a hero but I can't stand the stench. The Fitness Institute was full of General Motormen. And the ""Hello House of Beauty"" wouldn't stand a chance with them. The chairman of this boredom is a compliment collector. I'd like to be his funeral director. Chorus."
our little angel,This is the place where I made my best mistakes. This is the place even angels don't understand. I've seen the disappointment in her face. And the collection of engagement rings on her right hand. She sits alone apart from the crowd. In a white dress she wears like a question mark. Friends speak of her fondly. Enemies just think out loud. You think you're man enough to please her. And you're fool enough to start. You're not going to do a thing to our little angel. There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change. Now the cabaret is frozen and the laughter comes in cans. And the lonely hearts club clientele don't know what to do with their hands. You think that you'll be sweet to her but everybody knows. That you're the marshmallow valentine that got stuck on her clothes. But you're not going to do a thing to our little angel. There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change. So you mix your drinks and words. You make bad jokes you make bad time. The floors are there to walk over. The walls are there to climb. You swear that you'll never go back again once you're inside. You're never the bridegroom she's always the bride. And you're not going to do a thing to our little angel. There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change. You'll come in a sweetheart and you'll go out a stranger. Well you try to love her but she's so contrary. Like a chainsaw running through a dictionary. So get your mind off the sweet behind of our little angel. You're not going to do a thing. You're not going to do a thing.
"pads, paws and claws","She's a feline tormentor, not any vaudeville wife. But with a drunk-town lament he leads her a miserable life. But when he's full of that beer-champagne. She pads, paws, pads, paws and claws. And if he should wake up in some terrible dive. And he don't know if he's so-so. But he's so surprised he's alive. ""Come on little honey, let me under your hive"". She pads, paws, pads, paws and claws. She pads, pads around the bedroom, practicing ways to flirt. He paws, pours another drink and anything in a skirt. Anything wearing a necklace. He thinks of claws scratching his back he's. going out there he's not coming back. She's got spider-leg fingers, sharpened whenever he strays. And she carries a bird-purse, with all of her womanly ways. 'Til he's drinking hairspray, she knows that he never would dare. She could be in pictures if she wasn't all covered in fur. He's coming home now and here's the surprise. You wouldn't believe the lies that he tries. She cut him down to her favourite size. She pads, paws, pads, paws and claws. She pads, paws, pads, paws and claws."
painted from memory,"Such a picture of loveliness. Didn't you notice the resemblance?. Doesn't it look like she could speak?. Those eyes I tried to capture. They are lost to me now forever. They smile for someone else. Funny, how looks can be deceiving. But she's not easily. Painted from memory. You'd think that I would know by now. Those eyes I tried to capture. They are lost to me now forever. They smile for someone else. And so this had to be. Painted from memory. She is gone, and I must accept it. She is lost to me now. But I can't look away just yet though. She smiles for someone else. And so this had to be. Painted from memory. Funny, now I can see. How looks can be deceiving. And so this had to be. Painted from memory. Funny, now I can see. How looks can be deceiving."
party girl,They say you're nothing but a party girl. Just like a million more all over the world. I know I shouldn't be raising my hopes so high. But I have seen the hungry look in their eyes. They'd settle for anything in disguise of love. Seen the party girls look me over. Seen 'em leaving when the party's over. They can't touch me now. You say you don't mind. We're so hard to find. I could give you anything but time. Give it just one more try. Give it a chance. Starts like fascination. Ends up like a trance. Oh you'll never be the guilty party girl. Maybe someday we can go hiding from this world. Maybe I'll never get over the change in style. But I don't want to lock you up and say you're mine. Don't want to lose you or say goodbye. I'm the guilty party and I want my slice. But I know you've got me and I'm in a grip-like vise.. They can't touch me now. You say you don't mind. We're so hard to find. I could give you anything. I would give you anything. I can give you anything but time. Give you anything but time (repeats).
party party,"We're gonna drink enough tonight to drown the average army. By New Year's Day the next door neighbour will be goin' barmy. The milkman arrives at midday with his usual wisecrack. Who knows a girl with Wednesday legs so when's they gonna snap?. Chorus:. Why does everybody have to be so hale and hearty. Can't they see we're tryin' to have a party party party party. The last thing I remember I was talkin' to some fellas. Then she said she'd have a word for me with her good-looking mate. And handed me a pint-pot filled with Advocaat and Tizer. And I woke up in the flowerbed fearing fertilizer. Chorus. Bridge:. So shift yourself and shake your bod. You got bullet proof insurance from fire, flood and Act of God. You got to learn from your mistakes. When you got a face like last week's Cornflakes. The doors and the window frames are by Pablo Picasso. The party decorations owned by Michelangelo. The fine music that you hear is by Stravinsky. with overall design by Leonardo daVinci. Chorus. Bridge:. So shift yourself and shake your bod. You got bullet proof insurance from fire, flood and Act of God. You got to learn from your mistakes. When you got a face like last week's Cornflakes. Two boys are upstairs in your bed. Three girls are downstairs cryin'. The Alka Seltzer in the glass is roarin' like a lion. You think you've aged 10 years tonight and still never been kissed. So you overdose on aftershave and try to slash your wrist. Chorus and fade"
passionate fight,Obscure the late afternoon with a drape. Don't let him follow her latest escape. Or the fanfare of taxis that needlessly played. As a forty watt bulb burns a hole in the shade. Then they got into a passionate fight. Now she's lost in the shadows thrown over at twilight. At the Empire Hotel they first came face to face. Pieces would fall off all over the place. And there in the debris they'd laugh and recline. Tell me my dear are you more or less mine. Then they got into a passionate fight. She says now this isn't love it's what you do in spite of it. And I can't go on with it night after night after night. Camphor and cigarettes perfume the scandal. Now he's counting the hinges and watching the door handle. As he hangs the clothes on the back of the door. Perfectly matching outfits that she wore. Women come quietly and some remain with their pity. But others know the pain of the passion of fight. Though the chance they will win is impossibly slight. He cowers before them so invitingly. And in the long run they'll be chastised and hated. Or walk out frustrated or humiliated. That is the pointless delight of a passionate fight. This isn't love what you do in spite of it. I can't go on night after night after night after night after night after night...
pay it back,"Stop thief; you're gonna come to grief. if you don't take a little more care.. You're gonna get more than the family plan. from this one shoestring affair.. I may be crazy but I can't contemplate. being trapped between the doctor and the magistrate.. One of these days I'm gonna pay it back, pay it back,. one of these days.. One of these days I'm gonna pay it back, pay it back,. one of these days.. And then they told me I could be somebody. if I didn't let too much get in my way.. And I tried so hard just to be myself,. but I keep on fading away.. Until the lights went out, I didn't know what to do.. If I could fool myself, then maybe I'd fool you too.. chorus.

payday,"Let's go out on the town tonight. My pockets are heavy with loot. And get drunk and blasted. (And loud in your dress of blue). I've been living from hand to mouth. It must be three or four weeks. And I can tell you one thing Jack. You listen when your stomach speaks. I feel good just like I knew that I would. And all on account of that wine that I bought today. I'm smiling so sweet. At every little girl that I meet. Some fools will try to tell you it's a sin to feel this way. It feels so funny having all of this money. I think I feel like dancing the night away. I think I feel like dancing the night away. I got me this long legged girl. To help me to spend my dough. Her heart as big as your mama's stove. And her body like Brigitte Bardot. I'm all ready for some Rock and Roll. With the guitar turned up loud. And the fancy footwork. And the (drunk) down, druged up crowd. I feel good just like I knew that I would. All on account of that wine that I bought today. I'm smiling so sweet. At every little girl that I meet. Some fools will try to tell you it's a sin to feel this way. It feels so funny having all of this money. I think I feel like dancing the night away."
peace in our time,"Out of the aeroplane stepped Chamberlain with a condemned man's stare. But we all cheered wildly, a photograph was taken,. as he waved a piece of paper in the air. Now the Disco Machine lives in Munich and we are all friends. And I slip on my Italian dancing shoes as the evening descends. And the bells take their toll once again in victory chime. And we can thank God that we've finally got. peace in our time. There's a man going round taking names no. matter who you claim to be. As innocent as babies, a mad dog with rabies,. you're still a part of some conspiracy. Meanwhile there's a light over the ocean. burning brighter than the sun. And a man sits alone in a bar and says ""Oh God,. what have we done?"". Chorus. They're lighting a bonfire upon every hilltop in the land. Just another tiny island invaded when he's got. the whole world in his hands. And the Heavyweight Champion fights in the. International Propaganda Star Wars. There's already one spaceman in the White. House what do you want another one for?. Chorus."
photographs can lie,"He was wired, dynamite. And she was rare as treasure. That's not the kind of story you deny. In a frame under glass. They'll always be together and so in love. But photographs can lie. Now they say. That I have the gaze. That must recall my father. Sayin' he's my knight [night?]. My bright morning sun. Now I am [?] everyone. See him now, know he cheats. Why can't she see through him?. He used to be more valiant than vain. Put him on a pedestal. And it's a long way down there. I'll never be his little girl again. Now they say. That I have the gaze. That must recall my father. Sayin' ""He's my knight. ""My bright morning sun"". Now I am mourning everyone. Someone else will look at me. And think he is my lover. Developing the image in his eye. In a frame under glass. We'll always be together and so in love. But photographs can lie"
pidgin english,"There's a young girl with her old man who's too sick to mention. She'll be turning twenty seven as she draws her widow's pension. But he couldn't catch a common cold he couldn't get arrested. Too terrified to answer back. Too tired to have resisted. Many hands make light work. Shorthand makes life easy. When he's out on night work. Make sure no one sees me. It all ends up in a slanging match with body talk and bruises. A change is better than a rest. Silly beggars can't be choosers. One of a thousand pities you can't categorize. There are ten commandments of love. When will you realise. There are ten commandments of love. I believe, I trust, I promise, I wish love's just a throwaway kiss. In this Pidgin English. If you're so wise use your lips and your eyes. Take it to the bridge she sighs. You go cheep cheep cheep between bulleyes and bluster. Stiff as your poker face. Keener than mustard. From your own back yard to the land of exotica. From the truth society to neurotic erotica. Silence is golden. Money talks diamonds and ermine. There's a word in Spanish. Italian and German. In sign language, morse code, semaphore and gibberish. Have you forgotten how to say it. In your Pidgin English?. (chorus). PS I love you."

We're going to melt them down for pills and soap. Four and twenty crowbars, jemmy your desire. Out of the frying pan into the fire. The king is in the counting house. Some folk have all the luck. And all we get are pictures of LORD AND LADY MUCK. They come from lovely people with a hard line in. hypocrisy. THERE ARE ASHTRAYS OF EMOTION FOR THE FAG ENDS OF THE. ARISTOCRACY. The sugar coated pill is getting bitterer still. YOU THINK YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU BUT YOU KNOW IT NEVER. WILL. So pack up your troubles in a stolen handbag. DON'T DILLY DALLY BOYS RALLY ROUND THE FLAG. Give us your daily bread in individual slices. And something in the daily rag to cancel any crisis"
playboy to a man,"You had your own way one too many times and now. you're going to find out what it's like. Just what it's like, now you're a mess. You wanted something you could never possess. You went your own way one too many nights. You treated her like some small oversight. What in the world makes her think that she can. Turn you from a playboy into a man. CHORUS. She's going to make you suffer tonight. To turn you from a playboy into a man. And when you're worthy of her then she might. Turn you from a playboy into a man.

If I call out your name like a prayer. Would you leave me alone with my tears. Knowing I need you so. Would you still turn and go. This time be different in some way. Don't go please stay. You took me away from the rest of the world. When you taught me to love you like this. Now I hang my head when I think how you lied. But I still can be saved by your kiss. I loved you before I even knew your name. I wanted to give you my heart. But when you came back after leaving me one time. Oh I knew, yes I knew that the heartaches would start. If I told you my life was a song. That was written for you, you alone. Would you hurt all my pride. Oh, till I cry this time be different. Please stay. Oh, this time be different in some way."
poison moon,"Cut loose in a nightmare, cast off in my dreams. If home is anywhere that I can hang my hat. Then it's coming apart at the seams. My luck is hanging upside down. I try to hold on tight. But money's rolling out of town. And love slips right out of sight. And these bones, they don't look so good to me. Jokers talk and they all disagree. One day soon, I will laugh right in the face of the poison moon. You look in the mirror. I'm sorry, but it can't be replaced. You're thrown straight out in that cruel parade. Buttoned down and laced. It starts like fascination, it ends up like a trance. You've gotta use your imagination on some of that magazine romance. And these bones--they don't look so good to me. Jokers talk and they all disagree. One day soon, I will laugh right in the face of the poison moon. One day soon, I will laugh right in the face of the poison moon."
poisoned rose,The poisoned rose. That you gave to me. It left me half alive. And half in ecstasy. But if half of your love. Is all I can win. Give me just a fraction. But no more medicine. The poisoned rose. On a Valentine card. That you take straight to the heart. That you call my junkyard. But if all I can do. is save pieces of you. The piece of your mind. The piece of your heart. Didn't tear me apart. Like the poisoned rose. I received from you. I don't know. How we came to grow. Into this very sad affair. Everytime we do the decent thing. Somebody spikes the drink. And a single becomes a pair. The poisoned rose. That you wear at your best. That I keep pressed between the white sheets. Where you lie half undressed. I threw away my shirt and shoes. You looked and I dived in. It's just you and me now. 'Cause I threw away the gin. I threw away your alibis. And all your worn-out clothes. I threw myself upon the floor. But I couldn't throw away. This poisoned rose. This poisoned rose.
pony street,"She lives on Pony Street. And they should scatter flowers at her feet. But when they come calling I think it's appalling. They're sober and they're polite. They're deeply respectful when I would expect them. To keep her out all night. That little martinet. Will get her own way yet. If you need instruction in mindless destruction. I'll show you a thing or two. You used to adore me but now my life flashes before me. For you to view. Oh mother, oh mother, sometimes you are so mortifying.

poor fractured atlas,"He's out in the woods with his squirrel gun. To try to recapture his anger. He's screaming some words at the top of his lungs. Until he begins to feel younger. But back at his desk in the city we find. Our trembling punch-drunken fighter. Who can't find the strength now to punish the length. Of the ribbon in his little typewriter. Poor fractured Atlas. Threw himself across the mattress. Waving his withering pencil as if it were a pirate's cutlass. I'm almost certain he's trying to increase his burden. He said ""That's how the child in me planned it. A woman wouldn't understand it"". I believe there was something that I wanted to say. Before I conclude this epistle. But you would forgive me for holding my tongue. 'Cause man made the blade and the pistol. Yes man made the waterfall and the dam. To temper his tantrum with magic. Now you can't be sure of that ten of azure. Since he punched a hole in the fabric. Poor fractured Atlas. Threw himself across the mattress. Waving his withering pencil as if it were a pirate's cutlass. I'm almost certain he's trying to increase his burden. He said ""That's how the child in me planned it. A woman wouldn't understand it""."
poor napoleon,"I can't lie on this bed anymore it burns my skin. You can take the truthful things you've said to me. And put them on the head of a pin. Poor Napoleon. You always look so disappointed when I take my stockings off. Don't you know the facts of life, boy. Don't you know what these things cost. She was selling stolen kisses to travelling salesmen and minstrel singers. You put a penny in the slot. She called you her Magic Fingers. Poor Napoleon. I bet she isn't all that's advertised. I bet that isn't all she fakes. Just like that place where they take your spine. And turn it into soapflakes. so good night little school boy, you'd better learn some self control. did you mess up your hairstyle, pour scorn in your begging bowl. Bare wires from the socket to the bed where you embraced that girl. Did you ever think there's far too many people in the world?. One day they'll probably make a movie out of all of this. There won't even have to be a murder just a slow dissolving kiss."
possession,"If there's anything that you want. If there's anything that you need. There's no need to be evasive. Money talks and it's persuasive. Possession. Now you're sending me your best wishes. Signed with love and vicious kisses. You lack lust, you're so lacklustre. Is that all the strength you can muster. Possession. Even when we are out of touch. Now I know that I've seen too much. Seen too much. So I see us lying back to back. My case is closed my case is packed. I'll get out before the violence. Or the tears or the silence. Possession."
pouring water on a drowning man,"You push me when I'm falling. And then you put me down. I guess I missed my calling. I should have been a clown. How much more. How much more can I stand. You're pouring water. On a drowning man. You put me on the right track. And then you put me down. You stab me in the back. Everytime I turn around. Criticize my lovin'. When I'm doing the very best I can. You're pouring water. On a drowning man. You're pouring water. On a drowning man. You treat me like. The fool that I am. You bet that I like everything you do. Put salt in my wounds. It's sad but it's true. You warm me with your kisses. Then you leave me in the cold. How can I know your wishes. When I've never been told. Won't you please forgive me. Just try and understand. You're pouring water. On a drowning man. You're pouring water. On a drowning man. You treat me like. The fool that I am. You bet that I like everything you do. Put salt in my wounds. It's sad but it's true. You warm me with your kisses. Then you leave me in the cold. How can I know your wishes. When I've never been told. Won't you please forgive me. Just try and understand. You're pouring water. On a poor drowning man. I got tears in my eyes. Oh, I'm a drowning man. I got tears in my eyes. You're pouring water. On a drowing man. You're pouring water. On a poor drowning man."
pretty words,"I ask you nicely. Get my face slapped under wraps. What's going on precisely. Is there something wrong perhaps?. Surprise, surprise (surprise, surprise). It's more like a booby trap than a booby prize. Civil disobedience from a soldier with a dirty rifle. You're loosening all the screws that hold the hinges of my life. Fat cats and army brats. Hep cats and dog tag pawing over girly mags. Chorus:. Pretty words don't mean much anymore. I don't mean to be mean much anymore. All I see are snapshots, bigshots, tender spots. (1) mug shots, machine slots. (2) machine slots, mug shots. 'Till you don't know what's what. You don't know what you got. Curious women running after curious men. Curiosity didn't kill the cat. It was a poisoned pen. But there's not much choice (it's Hobson's choice). Between a cruel mouth and a jealous voice. Got back to London. Picked a paper from the man. No words of consolation. Just cartoons and titter tatter. Well well, fancy that. Millions murdered for a kiss me quick hat. No backbone, blood and guts. Better keep your big mouth shut. Chorus. ."
psycho,"Can Mary fry some fish, mama. I'm as hungry as can be. Oh lord, how I wish, mama. You could stop the baby cryin'. 'Cause my head is killing me. I saw my ex again last night mama. She was at the dance at Miller's store. She was with that Jackie White mama. I killed them both. And they're buried under Jacob's sycamore. You think I'm psycho don't you mama. I didn't mean to break your cup. You think I'm psycho don't you mama. You better let 'em lock me up. Oh, don't hand me Johnny's pup mama. As I might squeeze him too tight. I'm havin' crazy dreams again mama. So let me tell you 'bout last night. I woke up in Johnny's room mama. Standing right there by his bed. With my hands around his throat mama. Wishing both of us were dead. You think I'm psycho don't you mama. I just killed Johnny's pup. You think I'm psycho don't you mama. You'd better let 'em lock me up. Oh you recall that little girl mama. I believe her name was Betty Clark. Oh don't tell me that she's dead mama. 'Cause I just saw her in the park. We were sitting on a bench mama. Thinking of a game to play. Seems I was holding a wrench mama. Then my mind just walked away. You think I'm psycho don't you mama. I didn't mean to break your cup. You think I'm psycho don't you mama. Mama why don't you get up?. ."
pump it up,"I've been on tenterhooks. ending in dirty looks,. list'ning to the Muzak,. thinking 'bout this 'n' that.. She said that's that.. I don't wanna chitter-chat.. Turn it down a little bit. or turn it down flat.. Pump it up when you don't really need it.. Pump it up until you can feel it.. Down in the pleasure centre,. hell bent or heaven sent,. listen to the propaganda,. listen to the latest slander.. There's nothing underhand. that she wouldn't understand.. Pump it up until you can feel it.. Pump it up when you don't really need it.. She's been a bad girl.. She's like a chemical.. Though you try to stop it,. she's like a narcotic.. You wanna torture her.. You wanna talk to her.. All the things you bought for her,. putting up your temperature.. Pump it up until you can feel it.. Pump it up when you don't really need it.. Out in the fashion show,. down in the bargain bin,. you put your passion out. under the pressure pin.. Fall into submission,. hit-and-run transmission.. No use wishing now for any other sin.. Pump it up until you can feel it.."
punishing kiss,"(Words MacManus/O'Riordan, music: Costello). I favour a good punishing kiss. it helps pass the lonely afternoon. another stiff drink, wipe off that lipstick. For when you reach a certain age. All the most villainous men can be found on Channel Ten. I make them dance in attendance. 'We will be back in a minute or two'. And he will punish that girl. Oh forget the reason. Just look at me I'm lost in a social whirl. She was never so witty. Always struggling to be full of fun. 'On weekdays. From mid-day to one'. In a little black cocktail dress everyone hates. She'll be saving the world inbetween fashion plates. I know what she gets up to in the back of that blacked out limousine. And I catch myself shouting at the screen. I think that it's time to turn over. They say it's harmless I know. A hundred and ten percent certain. Virtually real. If you need something to feel. Then favour a punishing kiss. It helps chase the wasted afternoons. The flowers and pearls. The long lost relations. That love sick tom-boy comes in bloom. The pointless heartache. That seems to belong in my blue room. Can't stand the suspense. The endless embraces. Each episode lends the silly pretence. Say I can look away when I will never miss it. Starts with a joke. And ends with a punishing kiss."
put your big toe in the milk of human kindness,"Put your big toe in the milk of human kindness. Have you ever seen the like of this mankind?. If a boy or girl is cute, we simply shoot to starry heights. Any maybe, any might. But always so capricious, in the face of wonder we're suspicious. And though we came from frogs and fishes. Our taste is far from fine. Put your big toe in the milk of human kindness. Put your big toe in the milk of human kindness. Have you ever seen the like of this mankind?. You take the Himalayas, you'll take Manhattan's finest mountain top. He wouldn't change his whiskey sour for any bitter crop. But always so contrary, from Father Christmas to the Virgin Mary. And though the moments of belief. Fly by before you find if you'd just unhand your mind. Put your big toe in the milk of human kindness. But always so contrary, from Father Christmas to the Virgin Mary. And though the moments of belief. Fly by before you find if you'd just unhand your mind. Put your big toe in the milk of human kindness."
radio radio,I was tuning in the shine on the light night dial. doing anything my radio advised. with every one of those late night stations. playing songs bringing tears to me eyes. I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver. when the switch broke 'cause it's old. They're saying things that I can hardly believe.. They really think we're getting out of control.. Radio is a sound salvation. Radio is cleaning up the nation. They say you better listen to the voice of reason. But they don't give you any choice. 'cause they think that it's treason.. So you had better do as you are told.. You better listen to the radio.. I wanna bite the hand that feeds me.. I wanna bite that hand so badly.. I want to make them wish they'd never seen me.. . Some of my friends sit around every evening. and they worry about the times ahead. But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference. and the promise of an early bed. You either shut up or get cut out;. they don't wanna hear about it.. It's only inches on the reel-to-reel.. And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools. tryin' to anaesthetise the way that you feel. [Chorus]. Wonderful radio. Marvelous radio. Wonderful radio.
radio silence,"Signal fading, listen to what I'm saying.. Testing, testing,. this better be worth all of the breath I'm wasting.. Maintaining radio silence from now on.. Barricaded in the talk radio station. Hostage taken. The red 'On Air' light shines on. Something cheaper than passes for free speech. Will have to do. Hear him coming through loud and clear. Trickling in your ear. He'll tell you anything you want to hear. The tape starts running. He's going to tell you something. Strings start strumming another humdrum conundrum.. Signing off now,. Maintaining radio silence from now on.. But there's one thing I should have said,. The hostage will end up dead.. It's just a comedy, the hostage is me.. So pay the ransom beyond the run-out groove and. Get my wife down here, a helicopter on the roof.. No police marksman. Maintaining radio silence from now on.. Mystery voices drowned out by too much choice. That's not to mention. The sad waste of this wonderful invention. Maintaining radio silence from now on.. Libraries filled up with failed ideas,. there's nothing more for me there.. I trust in tender ink and gentle airs.. Do those drug dealers still polish women made of wax?. Gangsters and world leaders require the same protection from attack.. From a distance it's hard to tell the difference. Between a king and a jack. Between a poet and a hack."
radio sweetheart,"My head is spinning and my legs are weak. Goose step dancing, can't hear myself speak. Hope in the eyes of the ugly girls. That settle for the lies of the last chancers. When slow motion drunks pick wallflower dancers. You come here looking for the ride to glory. Go back home with a hard luck story. I can hardly wait around until the weekend comes to town. Play one more for my radio sweetheart. Hide your love, hide your love. Though we are so far apart. You've got to hide your love. 'Cause that's the way the whole thing started. I wish we had never parted. When it's late and the night gets colder. Don't lay your head on any other shoulder. Some hire themselves out for a good time. But you and I, we have been sold. So I keep on saying.... Play one more for my radio sweetheart. Hide your love, hide your love. Though we are so far apart. You've got to hide your love. 'Cause that's the way the whole thing started. I wish we had never parted."
really mystified,"He will break your heart, if you go with him.. Tear it all apart, and that would be a sin.. I'm really mystified, I even sat right down and cried.. I'm the one that needs you, I love you constantly.. Answer me, I need you, I'm waitnig patiently.. I'm really mystified, I even sat right down and cried.. Darling, if I let you go by, I'll be living in a dream of emptiness.. The feeling in my heart, my mind and my soul, if you would surely cure my loneliness.. He will break your heart, if you go with him.. Tear it all apart, and that would be a sin.. I'm really mystified, I even sat right down and cried.. Darling, if I let you go by, I'll be living in a dream of emptiness.. The feeling in my mind, my heart and my soul, if you would quickly cure my loneliness.. He will break your heart, if you go with him.. Tear it all apart, and that would be a sin.. I'm really mystified, I even sat right down and cried.. Ooh Yeah, mystified.. Really mystified.. Really mystified.. ."
refuse to be saved,"Now that you set everybody free. What you going to do about me?. Don't want to be treated like some poor grateful clown. I'd rather go back in the sweet underground. Where I can tell the time by the colour of my skin. And I know my neighbour 'cos he's the one, yes he's the one. Who always turns me in. A woman works the tunnel in the middle of the night. Picking up every lost object in sight. Handbags, toupees, lost legs and fingernails. The black market eats up all your failures. Her transistor offers no salvation or regrets. No pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Just non-stop Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes. There's no name, there's no name. There's no name, there's no name. There's no name, there's no name. For the pain we'll cause you again and again. For the pain we'll cause you again and again. The Liberation Forces make movies of their own. Playing their Doors records and pretending to be stoned. Drowning out a broadcast that wasn't authorised. Incidentally the revolution will be televised. With one head for business and another for good looks. Until they started arriving with their rubber aprons. and their butcher's hooks. There's no name, there's no name. There's no name, there's no name. There's no name, there's no name. For the pain we'll cause you again and again. For the pain we'll cause you again and again. They're hunting us down here with Liberty's light. A handshaking double talking procession of the mighty. Pursued by a T. V. crew and coming after them. A limousine of singing stars and their brotherhood anthem. The former dictator was impeccably behaved. They're mopping up all the stubborn ones. who just refuse to be saved. I refuse to be saved"
remove this doubt,It's hurting me. It's hurting me. This doubt is hurting me. So remove this doubt. From my heart little girl. And let me live my life. Knowing you care. Remove this doubt. From my mind little girl. And let me breathe again. Feeling my love is shared. Each time we meet. You make me feel so incomplete. There's no joy in the air. I just don't think you care. Close the door. On doubt forever. And may it nevermore. Make me unsure. Turn the key. And lock away this doubt in me. Keep it in the dark. Not in my heart. Be more tender. Completely surrender. Your love to me. Is sweet and not discrete. Remove this doubt. From my heart little girl. And let me live my life. Knowing you care. Remove this doubt. From my mind little girl. And let me breathe again. Knowing my love is shared. Each time we meet. You make me feel so incomplete. There's no joy in the air. I just don't think you care. Remove this doubt from my heart (6X).
riot act,Forever doesn't mean forever anymore. I said forever. But it doesn't look like I'm gonna be around much anymore. When the heat gets sub-tropical. And the talk gets so topical. Riot act - you can read me the riot act. You can make me a matter of fact. Or a villain in a million. A slip of the tongue is gonna keep me civilian. Why do you talk such stupid nonsense. When my mind could rest much easier. Instead of all this dumb dumb insolence. I would be happier with amnesia. They say forget her. Now it looks like you're either gonna be for me or against me. I got your letter. Now they say I don't care for the colour that it paints me. Trying to be so bad is bad enough. Don't make me laugh by talking tough. Don't put your heart out on your sleeve. When your remarks are off the cuff.
rocking horse road,"The chains from the bridle and the reins fell from my hands. The engines are idle and the ship sails on dry land. I stood there stupefied, I thought I recognized. Walking down Rocking Horse Road, getting lost. Shot through Vaseline, he picks up the paper from the lawn. And tucks ""The Suburban Assassin"" underneath his arm. He smiles weakly and turns away. I know you'll never come to harm. Walking down Rocking Horse Road, it's so peaceful. It's like a photograph. From the other side of the world. I said ""I want you only"". And then I left you alone. Crying on Rocking Horse Road, or somewhere quite like it. The cemetery gardens, there are names not numbers on the gateposts. And the eyes in the curtain follow you like a smirking ghost. I know I must not look back. 'Cause part of me is waiting still. There on Rocking Horse Road for you. In a little dream house made for two. Well you were the one that made your escape. In your stocking feet and your sticky tape. All the way down [repeat to fade]."
romeo's seance,"Is anyone there I can talk to?. Give us a sign if you're with me. CAN'T you see that I'm dying to hear you. EVERYONE ELSE HAS LOST INTEREST. AND I'M ALL ALONE IN THIS DREAM HOUSE. Though you're gone. I don't feel like crying. Romeo is calling you. Knock once or twice if you're out there. Send me a message my sweetheart. When I'm out and about I'll be coming to see you. IT ISN'T EASY TO LIVE WITH THIS MATRONLY FACE. AT THE WINDOW. Try to contact me, if you can see how I'm suffering. Romeo is calling you. Scatter the paper and thimbles. You can take care of the candles. An unplugged radio plays. She is close NOW. Me and my hand-holding baby walking the floor and the. ceiling. THIS IS the song SHE dictated this evening.. Romeo is calling you. ROMEO IS CALLING YOU."
room with no number,Picture a hotel room. Clothes scattered across the floor. Covers pulled back from the pillow. A sign hung on the door. Two lovers locked up tight. Through the endless days and nights. Hiding something they can't show. Something no-one must know. Chorus. There's a room without a number. While the sign outside says there's. no vacancy as you take your key. They smile at you so understandingly. She cried out in the night. Woke the porter from his sleep. He grinned slyly to himself. As he went to fetch his keys. Look what love has brought them to. This terrible nightmare. His or hers he could not tell. As they were sleeping there. Chorus. And I wish he could be. The man he was before he was me. A girl arrived at first light. And enquired if they'd been seen. And why the numbers ran from twelve. Missing out thirteen. And they said oh my darling. Put it down to superstition. Try to avoid a scandal. And don't arouse suspicion. They re-arranged the furniture. They even papered over the door. There's a room without a number. While the sign outside says there's. no vacancy as you take your key. They smile just so so you know. Chorus. .
rope,"Down by the harbourside. A boat is fastened by a length of rope.. It was a perfect match,. Dreaming of escape,. Feeling almost detached.. Look beneath the waves -. The seabirds diving down into black water.. The morning bells begin,. Schoolchildren chant and spin.. A length of rope. Below a hanging tree,. Like cruel secrets some of us turn out to be.. Should our love increase,. We are all released like statues from marble.. While in a prison yard,. They're taking turns to guard. A length of rope.. Are you too weak to fight?. Picking up a thread and then stretching it tight.. Look beneath the waves -. The seabirds diving down into black water.. Still our love increased,."
running out of angels,"They say they're running out of angels. They say I'm running out of time. Oh you don't have to be lucky. It is easier than trying, now they're bringing down a. Hammer on anything that sells. I suppose you're a winner. Because they're running out of angels. And all the lies upon the tongues of all the girls upon the rails. Will ruin any man who moved too soon. All except the one who seems to know more than she tells. You know she looks just like an angel. but she sings so out of tune. They say they're running out of angels. They say I'm running out of time. Oh you don't have to be lucky. It is easier than trying, now they're bringing down a. Hammer on anything that sells. I suppose you're a winner. Because they're running out of angels. Oh."
running out of fools,Sure you haven't got the wrong number. Sure it's me you want to talk to tonight. Everyone in town's got your number. Everyone in town's got you pegged just right. Is that why you got in touch with me. I guess you must be running out of fools. Even when you left me there crying. Your goodbye was even colder than ice. You didn't care that you left me there crying. Now you wanna break my heart twice. Is that why you got in touch with me. I guess you must be running out of fools. I guess you got back to my name in your little black book. Hey guess what I bet you forgot how I even look. So go ahead with all your sweet talking. Go ahead for all the good it will do. Have yourself a dime's worth of talking. Then I'm gonna hang right up on you. Cause this time you're not getting through to me. I guess you must be running out of fools. Even fools like me. Even fools like me. I guess you're running out of fools.
sad about girls,"To all the girls that awake to escape in the morning. You want to leave him without even a warning, a trace, or a calling card. Sad about girls who know perfectly well why he's so sad about this girl. He's so mad about this girl tonight. So understanding--oh, she's so undemanding. So in control, so on the whole--she's so good to you until it gets to you. Sad about girls in your polythene world. Where you unwrap and rewrap and know when she leaves. That the next girl to suffer, putting you [posed?]. Unwrap and love you before she can know you. She's just got to show you the way that you're gonna be sad. Sad about girls that awake to escape in the morning. Get up and leave without even a warning. But no where is sad as the girls in the night. So ready to please you, so ready to bite. Sad about girls who know perfectly well he's so sad about this girl. You're so sad about your girl tonight. Sad about girls tonight. So sad about girls tonight. ."
satellite,"She looked like she learned to dance from a series of still pictures. She's madly excited now, she throws her hands up like a tulip. She looks like an illustration of a cocktail party. Where cartoon bubbles burst in the air,. champagne rolls off her tongue Like a second language. And it should have been her biggest night. The satellite looks down on her as she begins to cry. All over the world at the very same time people sharing the same sorrow. As the satellite looks down her darkest hour is somebody's bright tomorrow. He pulled on a cigarette, in the crook of his first finger. Felt the static electric charge of her perfect hour-glass figure. As he undressed her with his eyes her weakness was his talent. How could she know as she stepped through the lights, that her dress would become transparent. And with his face pressed to the screen,. he muttered words he'd never dare to say if she could see him. All over the world at the very same time. People sharing the same cheap sensation the. thrill of watching somebody watching those. forbidden things we never mention. Chorus:. The satellite looks down right now and forever. What it has pulled apart let no man tether his own body to his dream,. His dream to someone else. Oh no, oh no.. She went back to a pitiful compromise, He'd go back to his family. But for the matter of a thousand miles that separated them entirely. In the hot unloving spotlight, with secrets it arouses. Now they both know what it's like inside a pornographer's trousers. And in a funny way it's anonymous, the satellite. it blesses us and makes these dreams come. true... All over the world. Chorus."
secondary modern,This must be the place. Second place in the human race. Down in the basement. Now I know what he meant. Secondary modern. But there must be a problem till the girls go home. This is the hand that you never shook. You never gave me the chance that I took. Secondary modern. But there won't be a problem till the girls go home. Is it out of the question. Between you and me. Is it pleasure or business. Or a packet of three?. Nobody makes me sad like you. Now my whole world goes from blue to blue. Secondary modern. But there won't be a problem till the girls go home....
seconds of pleasure,"You say you don't desire me,. she's only a hired hand,. now you are tired of me.. Expensive care is meaningless,. feeling nothing and caring less..

And the lucky girl leads a life of leisure,. though she? with forty-five years. for seconds of pleasure.. I thought I knew you too well,. now I find the man is a mystery,. and the promises you made. are really only ancient history.. Everyday goes by without a hitch,. you say the urge becomes an itch.. You say that I'm no go for you, that's rich,. or am I being bitchy?. And the lucky girl leads a life of leisure,. though she forty-five years. for seconds of pleasure.. And the hands on the clock move so precisley,. You say you only kissed her once or twice.. You didn't do it for love, you didn't even do it with stealth.. I can't help you now,. I can't help myself.. Commited to life and then commuted to the outskirts.. I was living for thirty minutes at a time. with a break in the middle for adverts.. You treat me like a piece of human furniture.. You say when? you sad soul,. if you can look all that you like,. but I won't let you touch and poke.. And the lucky girl leads a life of leisure,. though she ? forty-five years. for seconds of pleasure.."
senior service,Chorus:. Senior service. Junior dissatisfaction. It's a breath you took too late. It's a death that's worse than fate. Senior service. Junior dissatisfaction. Though it may be second hand. It's by no means second rate. I want your neck. I want the seat that you sit at. I want your cheque. Because they told me I would get on. I wanna chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket. If you should drop dead tonight then they won't have to ask me twice. (Chorus). They took me in the office and they told me very carefully. The way that I could benefit from death and disability. (Chorus). I want your company car. I want your girlfriend and love. I want your place at the bar. Because there's always another man. To chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket. If you should drop dead tonight then they won't have to ask me twice.
seven day weekend,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.. Monday's calling you too early when you're sound asleep. Bells are ringing by your bedside and out in the street. Usually Monday's long enough, but this is just the start. Tuesday's just the same as Monday without the surprising part. Wednesday's point of no return. When you've squandered all you've earned. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, seven day weekend. (x2). This is all I'm thinking about as the days go by. Spend your life on holiday and even when I die. There could be but one inscription: ""This was not his day"". If it isn't Thursday anymore, it must be Friday. I can't wait until I maybe. Get off work and see my baby. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, seven day weekend. (x2). I can't wait until I maybe. Get off work and see my baby."
shabby doll,Giving you more of what for. Always worked for me before. Now I'm a shabby doll. What's going on behind the green elevator door. With just a shabby doll. There's a hit man facing. A compromising situation. With just a shabby doll. And a very neat line in character assassination. She's just a shabby doll. She's just a shabby doll. She's putting him off and putting you on. She's just the shabby doll. You're swearing upon you know in your heart. She's gone you know in your heart. She's just a shabby doll. There's a girl in this dress. There's always a girl in distress. She's just a shabby doll. She's so sure she's self-possessed. Then again she's half undressed. She's just a shabby doll. The boy that I used to be. Showed no sign of sympathy. For just a shabby doll. I have betrayed you and me. And paid for my own bribery. With just a shabby doll. (chorus). He's the tired toy that everyone enjoyed. He wants to be a fancy man but he's nothing but a nancy boy. He's all pride and no joy. And being what you might call a whore. Always worked for me before. Now I'm a shabby doll. Untie the gag the cat's out of the bag. But won't show his claws. He's just a shabby doll. She said you must be joking. Some things are left unspoken. You're just a shabby doll. He's lying limp and soaking. He was openly broken. By just a shabby doll.
shadow and jimmy,"Shadow and Jimmy were always yesterday's news. Jimmy's a bowler, Shadow rents out his green bowling shoes. Late Friday night when the bars are all shuttered and dark. He shadows back Jimmy to the lot in the lost trailer park. For shadow and Jimmy all the weekends end up the same. If it's Saturday night, then it must be the hockey game. After cold beer and barbecued ribs the night is complete. With wrestling stories and elegant bones. That are tired of walking and on their way home. Chorus. And they talk about the women. And they look at the girls. They'll never know the ways of the world. They've got a mouthful of much obliged. And a handful of gimme. And the love for each other. Of Shadow and Jimmy. For Shadow and Jimmy now the story is told. There's nothing to hold on to and no one to hold. Men without women are like fish without. water to swim in. With their eyes bugging out. They flop on the beach. And look up at the girls. Who are just out of reach."
shallow graves,"When I fall in endless sleep. I hope that I'll be buried deep. Let me be the one that fortune favours. Even good children got shallow graves. Throw another clown to the lions. Throw another Joan on the blaze. Cast me away on the cruel calm ocean. and leave me for days and days and days and days and days. I won't lie in this poor shallow grave. I won't lie, I won't lie in this poor shallow grave. Dig me down deep where the dead men sleep. I won't lie in this poor shallow grave. Bless the poor 'cos like the rich. They all end up in a ditch. In this world of fools and knaves. Even good children got shallow graves. The tinker, the tailor, the fabulous five. Nobody gets out of this alive. Chorus. Dig me down deep where the dead men sleep. I won't lie in this poor shallow grave. Dig me down deep where the dead men sleep. I won't lie in this poor shallow grave. Dig me down, dig me down, dig me down deep. I won't lie in this poor shallow grave."
shamed into love,"(Written by Elvis Costello, Submitted by Craig Ciccone). I fear, my dear. We've forgotten the things strangers do. If we could look back. To the terrible thrill that we knew. Am I imagining a world without you?. Must we be shamed into love?. What can I say?. Will you pardon my stupid embrace?. Sometimes I'm desperate. While you're wiping the smile from your face. Am I surrendering, or am I replaced?. Must we be shamed into love?. Shamed into love. You're once a fool for having it. Twice for letting it go. Somewhere, my love, there's a feeling deep inside of me. That I can't let go. Oh, you'll never know. But then, my darling. I've forbidden myself to confess. I've looked around now. But I always return to your face. In a world where everything. I once cursed, I bless. It must be you who shamed me into love. Must we be shamed into love?."
shatterproof,"I see those newly weds. Their eyes wide and believing. They bill and coo at the mention of Chez Nous. Appearances can be deceiving. It's just a door and a window. Four walls and a roof. But a home of your own would be shatterproof. A door and a window. Four walls and a roof. But a home of your own would be shatterproof. We papered over all the cracks. and painted a cat's lick and a promise. The landlord was a man of few words. and most of them were ominous. It's just a door and a window. Four walls and a roof. But a home of your own would be shatterproof. A door and a window. Four walls and a roof. But a home of your own would be shatterproof. It was nothing really to write home about. Then one day it all appears too much. Here comes my little hammer and its shatterproof touch. He said, ""Be practical,. These are most unreasonable demands.. Forget about the broken spectacles. and the damage to your hand."". It's just a door and a window. Four walls and a roof."
she,"She. May be the face I can't forget.. A trace of pleasure or regret. May be my treasure or the price I have to pay.. She may be the song that summer sings.. May be the chill that autumn brings.. May be a hundred different things. Within the measure of a day.. She. May be the beauty or the beast.. May be the famine or the feast.. May turn each day into a heaven or a hell.. She may be the mirror of my dreams.. A smile reflected in a stream. She may not be what she may seem. Inside her shell. She who always seems so happy in a crowd.. Whose eyes can be so private and so proud. No one's allowed to see them when they cry.. She may be the love that cannot hope to last. May come to me from shadows of the past.. That I'll remember till the day I die. She. May be the reason I survive. The why and wherefore I'm alive. The one I'll care for through the rough and rainy years. Me I'll take her laughter and her tears. And make them all my souvenirs. For where she goes I've got to be. The meaning of my life is. She, she, she"
she's pulling out the pin,"She's pulling out the pin. That lets her hair fall down. She shakes her head and. It goes tumbling. Her smile was out of place. So she swept it off her face. Let me find the words and say them. Like some softly whispered Amen. As she starts to pull away. And the lights begin to dim. Is she thinking of me. Or is she thinking of him. She's pulling out the pin. She's slipping off the hook. Unbuttoning her dress. There's just enough to make some man a mess. She tears away the veil. With her fingernails. She came out high and kicking. While the band played ""Hey good lookin'"". Do you hear something ticking?. Did somebody tell her?. You can really be redeemed. Could she actually be?. As desperate as she seems. She's tearing at the seams. She's going to extremes. Nobody told her it was a sin. So she's pulling out the pin. She's taping up her hands. Just as a boxer will. They started laughing. But if looks could kill. She'd take them down right now. She's covering her mouth. With someone or without. There's nothing more to say. This is her wedding day. Full of shattered glass and mayhem. Not one softly whispered amen. She's knocking down some doors. And the smoke begins to fill. Where the world without her ends. And the next one begins. She's pulling out the pin"
shipbuilding,Is it worth it. A new winter coat and shoes for the wife. And a bicycle on the boy's birthday. It's just a rumour that was spread around town. By the women and children. Soon we'll be shipbuilding. Well I ask you. The boy said 'DAD THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ME TO TASK. BUT I'LL BE BACK BY CHRISTMAS'. It's just a rumour that was spread around town. Somebody said that someone got filled in. For saying that people get killed in. The result of this shipbuilding. With all the will in the world. Diving for dear life. When we could be diving for pearls. It's just a rumour that was spread around town. A telegram or a picture postcard. Within weeks they'll be re-opening the shipyards. And notifying the next of kin. Once again. It's all we're skilled in. We will be shipbuilding. WITH ALL THE WILL IN THE WORLD. DIVING FOR DEAR LIFE.
shoes without heels,"This love of mine is packed with stepping stone. These shoes are made for walking in reverse. In the dead of night, you tiptoe out and leave me all alone. Putting on your satin slip-ons and your sultry French cologne.. She's wearing shoes without heels.. She's walking over the floor.. She's walking all over me. Weirder therein, you know how it feels. When she walks right out of the door.. Well, I thought that I was bigger than this town. I thought I'd spend a pace and go the distance. But she picked me out, she used me up, and then she put me down. Now I'm driven til I'm crying, or I'm dreaming 'til I drown.. She's wearing shoes without heels.. She's walking over the floor.. She's walking all over me. Weirder therein, you know how it feels. When she walks right out of the door.. While you're busy packing underwear and other worthless trinkets,. Spare a thought for worthless men who drag on women like they're. cigarettes, 'cause you watch him walk away from you. While he gets down and deals. Oh, he'll watch you walk away without heels. Oh, you think that he's a fool to tolerate. All the liberty you cherish and you roughly take. But to watch your love turn slowly from indifference to hate. Would hurt him more than any heart that you might care to break.. She's wearing shoes without heels.. She's walking over the floor.. She's walking all over you. But when she's finished, I know (?)."
shot with his own gun,"How does it feel now you've been undressed. by a man with a mind like the gutter press. So disappointed to find it's no big sin. Lying skin to skin. Chorus:. Shot with his own gun. Now dad is keeping mum. Shot with his own gun. Now somebody has to pay for the one who got away. What's on his mind now is anyone's guess. Losing his touch with each caress. Spending ev'ry evening looking so appealing. He comes without warning. Leaves without feeling. Chorus. On your marks, man, ready, set. Let's get loaded and forget. The little corporal got in the way. And he got hit by an emotional ricochet. It's a bit more now than dressing up dolly. Playing house seems so melancholy. Chorus. Oh it's too sad to be true. Your blue murder's killing you."
sittin' and thinkin',"I got loaded last night on a bottle of gin. And I had a fight with my best girlfriend. When I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend. So please baby wait for me until they let me out again. I know the same thing has happened before. And each time it happens, I hate it more & more. When I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend. So please baby wait for me until they let me out again. I spent a whole lotta time sittin' & thinkin'. Sittin' & just thinkin' 'bout you. If I didn't spend so much time sittin' & drinkin'. We'd still have the love I thought we knew. I won't promise the same thing won't happen again. But I can promise, it'll be a long, long time till then. 'Cause when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend. So please baby wait for me until they let me out again. ."
sleep of the just,"The soldier asked my name and did I come here very often. Well I thought that he was asking me to dance. In my HOLEY coat and hat and him in his red bonnet. We'd have made a lovely couple but we never had the chance. [chorus]. And now you say that you've got to go. Well if you must you must. I suppose that you need the sleep of the just. Well it was a powerful day and there were black crows in the road. And I kept my strong opinions to my chest. I suppose I should have told them that I was on fire for you. When the bus burst into flames outside some place, 'The Poet's Rest'. [chorus]. A girl woke up in a naked light and said ""Oh no not again"". He even looked like her brother in the army but she never mentions him. He'll be tucked up in his bed tonight with his dirty-pictures girl. Saying, 'You're some mother's daughter you know or is it. immaterial girl?'. Now she's pinned up upon the barracks wall in her home town. All the soldiers taking turns with their attentions. And as they speculate what she'd look like beneath that thin nightgown."
sleepless nights,"Through the sleepless nights. I cry for you. And wonder who. Is kissing you. Oh, these sleepless nights. Will brake my heart in two. Somehow, through the day. I don't give in. I hide the tears. That wait within. Oh, these sleepless nights. Will break my heart again. Why did you go?. Oh, why did you go?. Don't you know, don't you know. I need you?. Through the sleepless nights. I cry for you. And wonder who. Is kissing you. Oh, these sleepless nights. Will break my heart in two. Oh, oh, oh, oh, these sleepless nights. Will break my heart in two. Oh, oh, oh, oh, these sleepless nights. Will break my heart in two."
sneaky feelings,"Now everybody's breakin' up somebody else's home,. before somebody else starts breaking up their own.. I get you in my dreams.. You should hear the things you say.. I's not that it's so much fun,. but it's safer that way.. Sneaky feeling, sneaky feelings,. you can't let those kind of feeling show.. I'd like to get right through the way I feel for you,. but I've still got a long way to go.. Why don't we call it a day, and we can both confess.. You can force me to use a little tenderness.. White lies, alibis, anything but say that it's true.. Now we could sit like lovers, staring in each other's eyes,. but the magic of the moment might become too much for you.. Sneaky feeling, sneaky feelings,. you can't let those kind of feeling show.. I'd like to get right through the way I feel for you,."
so like candy,"Here lies the powder and perfume. The pretty clothes are scattered 'round the room. And it's so like Candy. Here lies the lipstick and the face. The coloured tablets keep it all in place. And it's so like Candy. So like Candy. CHORUS. What did I do to make her go. Why must she be the one. That I have to love. So like Candy. Here lies a picture of a girl. Her arms are tight around that lucky guy. And it's so like Candy. And in her eyes a certain look. I thought I'd seen the last of long ago. And it's so like Candy. So like Candy. CHORUS. I remember the day that picture was taken. We were so happy then. But that's so like Candy. She seemed so sweet to me I was mistaken. Oh no not that again. But that's so like Candy. She just can't face the day. So she turns and melts away. Here lie the records that she scratched. And on the sleeve I find a note attached. And it's so like Candy. ""My Darling Dear it's such a waste"". She couldn't say ""goodbye"", but ""I admire your taste"". And it's so like Candy."
so young,"Do.. Do do do do do.. So young, we've discovered. Got them so confused.. Don't mind putting the time in. It's shocking.. That's what they all say now when we're walking hand in hand. As one, you and I.. Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, you said it's timed out. We've got them hangin' on a string.. There's no time for compromises; we got that good old thing.. So young, so young. (x4). It's wrong to run for cover. We've got them in a spin.. You don't mind sticking the sticker in. It's too late.. That's what they all say now when we're walking hand in hand. As one, you and I.. Chorus.. Do do do do do. Do do do.. Chorus, again.. So young, so young.."
some took the words away,"Poor head. Can hardly move my lips for speaking. I said. So, what is this thing I cannot explain?. I'd blame all the things I feel but can't quite place. Perhaps they're written on my face. Someone took the words away. Why don't you speak up and say what you mean?. Summon my powers of conversation. I talk to myself,. I'm fine. When you're around,. Then I decline the invitation. It's strange to finally find myself so tongue-tied. A change has come over me. I'm powerless to express. Every thing I know but cannot speak. And if I try my voice will break. Someone took the words away."

soul for hire,"Hang my head and shut my eyes. What kind of justice is this?. Fool I was, I thought that you fought fire with fire. Got to be more than just a soul for hire. Speaking for myself I wouldn't take the fame,. the fees, the glory. For whoring in the practice of the law. I make my case stop and stutter. Soul comes unglued from the uppers. Blood is seeping in the hole. A mother's eye is weeping. I see every human kind. And still the truth is distant. I see every evil men do and desire. Got to be more than just a soul for hire. When it's time to give protection. To the ones who need it most, who are desperate. I get distracted from my job. Streams of ink and piles of paper. What are the breaks?. Jump out the window? Parole? Escape?. Blood is seeping in the hole. A mother's eye is weeping. Hang my head and shut my eyes. I can't see justice twisted. I see every evil men do and desire. Got to be more than just a soul for hire. When it's time to give protection. To the ones who need it most, who are desperate. I get distracted from my job. Streams of ink and piles of paper. To hand them over to dopers and kiddie-rapers. corrupt in every twisted grudge. And that is just the judge. Hang my head and shut my eyes. What kind of justice is this?. ."
sour milk-cow blues,"You like coffee and you like tea. Much more than you like me. And everybody says watch out yeah. For the sour milk-cow blues. You like your coffee just a little too sweet. Without your sugar life is incomplete. And everybody says watch out yeah. For the sour milk-cow blues. I think about you everyday. Something about you is not the same. Something about the things you say. Sounds like a different woman with a different name. Sour milk-cow blues. You wear a different size and style of shoe. I think that someone must be poisoning you. To replace you with a living double. Get out of my life right now and save them all of the trouble. They changed your complexion and your personality. Somebody's putting ideas in your head. They took the girl of my dreams and left you here instead. Sour milk-cow blues. You take your place in this parade of pleas. You dial a number and they offer relief. All alone with just your own device. They give you something and it isn't advice. To break the hearts of a million listeners. Start out as lovers and you end up as prisoners. Somebody's suffering from the things that you do. Somebody's suffering but you're glad it isn't you. Put your fingertips up to the screen. Repeat after me, wake at the count of three. Now I don't know which is worse. What they're doing to you or what you're doing to me. Sour milk-cow blues. ."
sparkling day,"Oh, it was such a sparkling day. That I should be singing its praises. Just to catch my senses as they slip away. But my sentences and phrases. Are about as worthless as wonder can be. And there are words that I could say. Perhaps I lack the sense of occasion. Seems that I've been looking down so long you see. That it seemed like up to me. I should be ashamed I'm sure you will agree. Pre Chrosus. So don't go calling out for Jude or Anthony. Maybe I was lost. I'm a hopeless case. So that every night I listen carefully. But there is no message from me. No message from me. Chorus. Sparkling day (x2). Things I never said. Some things you never heard. Sparkling day (x2). Now I wait in vain to see. That there was no message from me. When love is constant and content. You always fear some lingering temptation. Silhouettes escaping underneath locked doors. I'm astonished and amazed. Perhaps my message was erased.. Pre Chrosus. So don't go calling out for Jude or Anthony. Maybe I was lost. I'm a hopeless case. So that every night I listen carefully.

spooky girlfriend,"I want a girl to make a mess. To do no wrong she must confess. And then perhaps hitch up her dress. 'Cos when the flashbulbs explode. She's such a sensitive soul.... I want a girl who is helpless and frail. Who won't pull on my ponytail. I want a girl who has no past. She's made up now. But that won't last. 'Cos when she sits on my knee. And then she whispers to me. ""Can't you see. I could be. I could be. Your spooky girlfriend"". The broken toys are all scattered in the attic. Newspapers play with the words of the fanatic. While the greeting cards are your most poetic lyric. And the flat champagne is sweet sugar syrup. I want to paint you with glitter and with dirt. Picture you wit innocence and hurt. The shutter closes. Exposes the shot. she says, ""Are you looking up my skirt?"". When you say ""No"". She says ""Why not?"". I want a girl to turn my screw. To wind my watch, to buckle my shoe. And if she won't her mother will do. But when she does as she's told. We'll all turn platinum and gold. But when she sits on my knee. I hear her whispers to me. ""Can't you see?."
st. stephen's day murders,"I knew of two sisters whose name it was Christmas. And one was named Dawn of course, the other one was named Eve. I wonder if they grew up hating the season. Of the good will that lasts till the Feast of St. Stephen. For that is the time to eat, drink and be merry. 'Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey is flowed. And the whole family tree you neglected to bury. Are feeding their faces until they explode. [Chorus:]. There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias. Mixed up with that drink made from girders. And it's all we've got left as you draw your last breath. And it's nice for the kids as you've finally got rid of them. In the St Stephen's Day Murders. Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air. While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair. And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize. The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize. His gin-flavoured whispers and kisses of sherry. His best crimble shirt flung out over the shop. While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly. His face closes in like an old cold pork chop. And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast. May still be found haunting the kitchen. And there's life in it yet we may live to regret. When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'"
stalin malone(instrumental),"I'm going to make you even fear the dream you dream. So don't even think about it don't make a wish. You think that I don't see you as you trawl those young weak fish. Hooked on those poor wonders, 'til they want you alone. Though they can't tell a cuckoo-clock from the squeals of saxophones. That's when they'll fear my name. Stalin Malone. I'm telling you the day will come when this man gets what he merits. Though people still wear animal skins to ward off evil spirits. Only wife-swapping and witchcraft woke the dormitory town. 'Til horse's heads up in the trees came dripping down. Yes, horse's heads up hung in the trees after the bird had flown. Did you wonder of my whereabouts as the barrack-room was blown. Did anybody call my name?. Stalin Malone. In a room called creation, where you all obey my laws. Where Seconal is gravity and pain is like applause. You think that this phenomenon is some coincidence. But I've got people everywhere, you're under. my surveillance, in the pocket of my pants. Okay, she left me, but I'll soon get over that. Falling out of the ""Blood Tub"" and rolling, on my back. Waking up to the one o'clock gun with a Punch and Judy bird. Reaching out for a gelignite beer that fills me up with murder. To overhear forbidden songs her lover must have known. Between the pity and advice.... ""There's no one here to help you now, but speak after the tone"". Leave for me a message of hope. Stalin Malone. Now the church door is a roller-shutter with padlocks and keys. Just like all of the other dispensaries. The saloon is like a casket, stained wood and human dust. Stale with conversation that hangs on your clothes like smoke. The wooden clock said she would dance dressed only in flower. As the jazz band drowns the hysterical bird that it spits out on the hour. I'd drop out of sight and disappear, turn up in another town, but somehow. I just can't seem to put it down, put it down, put it down. I just want to hold her now in that I'm not alone. but do I have to see her fall into his arms before I can atone..."
starting to come to me,"It's started to come to me. Your new career would probably end like this. All that professional lipstick pressed into an amateur kiss. Farewell to the studied lines and carefully broken hearts. The overpowering perfume and the glimpse of her garter. Mingling with the sweet smoldering scent of the martyr. Well it's starting to come to me (come to me, come to me). Starting to come to me. So you began to recognize the well-dressed man that everybody loves. It started when you chopped off all the fingers of those pony skin gloves. Then you cut a hole out where the lovelight used to shine. Your tears of pleasure equal measure crocodile and brine. You try to laugh it off saying ""I knew all the time.... But it's starting to come to me"" (come to me, come to me). Starting to come to me. Sometimes you bring me down to play reluctant confidant. You say you may reward him if he gives you what you want. But these are days to treasure and to hold. They are much too precious to be sold. You'd probably play the pirate if you weren't so busy digging up the gold. Now you could tell he wanted you 'cause you almost taste it on his breath. But you always cheated life just like the bold dare-devil cheated death. Incidentally, late last night your understudy finally got what you deserve. In private she's seductive but in public she's prim, porcelain and nervous. Afraid someone will recognize the shame in her eyes. You've still got your dignity or the next best disguise. You never know when to say no and when to compromise. But it's starting to come to me (come to me, come to me). Starting to come to me (come to me, come to me). Starting to come to me."

Rest your head on my shoulder. And love me tonight. I'll always be here if you should need me. Night and day. Step inside love and stay. Step inside love. Step inside love. Step inside love. I want you to stay. When you leave me, say you'll see me again. For I know in my heart. We will not be apart. And I'll miss you till then. We'll be together now and forever. Come what may.

stick out your tongue,"They talked to the sister, the father and the mother. With a microphone in one hand. and a chequebook in the other. And the camera noses in to the tears on her face. The tears on her face. The tears on her face. You can put them back together with your paper and paste. Stick out your tongue. Drink down the venom. She sleeps with the shirt of a late, great country singer. Stretched out upon her poor jealous husband's pillow. In time you can turn these obsessions into careers. While the parents of those kidnapped children. start the bidding for their tears. What would you say?. What would you do?. Children and animals two by two. Give me the needle. Give me the rope. We're going to melt them down for pills and soap. Four and twenty crowbars, jemmy your desire. Out of the frying pan into the fire. The king is in the counting house. Some folk have all the might. And majesty will run on Bombay Gin and German spite. They come from lovely people. (They come from lovely people). With a hard line in hypocrisy. There are tears of mediocrity. For the fag ends of the aristocracy. What would you say?. What would you do?. Children and animals two by two. Give me the needle. Give me the rope. We're going to melt them down for pills and soap. Stick out your tongue. Stick out your tongue. Drink down the venom. The sugar-coated pill is getting bitterer still. You think your country needs you but you know it never will. So pack up your troubles in a stolen handbag. Don't dilly dally boys rally 'round the flag. Give us our daily bread in individual slices. And something in the daily rag to cancel any crisis. What would you say?. What would you do?. (Did you find out how to lie?). Children and animals two by two. (Did you find out how to cheat?). Give me the needle. (The elite bleat, they're obsolete). We're going to melt them down. Stick out your tongue. (We're going to melt them down for pills and soap). Now if you'd only genuflect. Stick out your tongue. Now if you'd only genuflect.

sticks and stones,"People talkin', tryin' to break us up. Why don't they let us be. Sticks and stones may break my bones. But talk don't bother me. (No) People talkin', tryin' to break us up.

I've been accused (I've been accused). I've been rebuked and I've been stomped. (Well) People talkin', tryin' to break us up. They're scandalizing my name. They'll say anything just to make me feel bad. They'll say anything to make me shamed. I've been abused (I've been abused). In my heart (I've been accused). I've been accused (I've been accused).

still,"These few lines I'll devote. To a marvelous girl covered up in my coat. Pull it up to your chin. I'll hold you until the day will begin. Still. Lying in the shadows this new flame will cast. Upon everything we carry from the past. You were made of every love and each regret. Up until the day we met. There are no words that I'm afraid to hear. Unless they are ""Goodbye, my dear"". Still. I was moving very fast. But in one place. Now you speak my name and set my pulse to race. Sometimes words may tumble out but can't eclipse. The feeling when you press your fingers to my lips. I want to kiss you in a rush. And whisper things to make you blush. And you say, ""Darling, hush. Hush."
still too soon to know,"Do you love him. Or is it still too soon to know?. When I think back a couple of days. Before I found you in his spell. Was there a warning?. What can I say. Should I look away. It's still too soon to know. Are you sorry. Or is it still to soon to know?. It didn't take much to break us in two. For it was in the way that he came close to touching you. The look in your eyes. I thought I recognised. It's still too soon to know. And it's still too soon to know. Will you stay or will you go?. It's still too soon to know. When I think back a couple of days. If I wasn't happy then, I never will be. I wonder was this ignorance or bliss?."
strange,"How many wrinkles in a pickle. How many hairs in a head. How many waves in the ocean. How many crumbs in bed. But last but not least, but baby most of all. Why do I mmmumble everytime you call. Chorus. Because you're strange to me baby. Oh, you're good to me mama. Well, I admit you are strange. But baby please don't change. I know I belong with you. How many bubbles in soap. How many chewings in gum. How many rolls in a wheel. Where did eyeballs come from. But last but not least. But baby most of all. Why do I mmmumble everytime you call. (Chorus). How many blanks in a blanket. How many cuts in a knife. How strong is a bedbug. And how deep is his bite. But last but not least. But baby most of all. Why do I mmmumble everytime you call.

Strange you got two left legs ...???. Strange there's something wrong with you I don't know what it is. Strange I'm gonna leave you alone, gonna leave you like this."
stranger in the house,This never was one of the great romances. But I thought you'd always have those young girl's eyes. But now they look in tired and bitter glances. At the ghost of a man who walks 'round in my disguise. I get the feeling that I don't belong here. But there's no welcome in the window anyway. And I look down for a number on my keychain. 'Cause it feels more like a hotel everyday. There's a stranger in the house; nobody's seen his face. But everybody says he's taken my place. There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see. But everybody says he looks like me. And now you say you've got no expectations. But I know you also miss those carefree days. And for all the angry words that passed between us. You still don't understand me when I say. There's a stranger in the house; nobody's seen his face. But everybody says he's taken my place. There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see.
strict time,"There's a hand on a wire that leads to my mouth. I can hear you knocking but I'm not coming out. Don't want to be a puppet or a ventriloquist. 'Cause there's no ventilation on a critical list. Fingers creeping up my spine are not mine to resist. Strict time. Chorus:. Toughen up, toughen up. Keep your lip buttoned up. Strict time. Oh the muscles flex and the fingers curl. And a cold sweat breaks out on the sweater girl. Strict time. Oh he's all hands, don't touch that dial. The courting cold wars weekend witch trial. Strict time. All the boys are straight laced and the girls are frigid. The talk is two-faced and the rules are rigid 'cause it's strict time. Strict time. Chorus. You talk in hushed tones, I talk in lush tones. Try to look Italian through the musical Valium. Strict time. Thinking of grand larceny. Smoking the everlasting cigarette of chastity. Cute assistants staying alive. More like a hand job than the hand jive. Strict time. Chorus. . ."

Back then we didn't have means. for fine decorations. So we painted while mixing wine. with flirtation. There in the mess of it all. He took me right there in the thrill. Not quite against my will. With my back to that rococo wall. We slipped right down to the floor. I can't close the door. he complimented my taste. I anointed his serious face. with wallpaper [pics?]. I wish we could laugh like that now. But what seemed to follow. That ended up hollow. [Was I there?]. Tear a strip or two. See what what came not much later. Here's a pony and a toy balloon. Behind the [violet?] all too soon. Here's the pencil of a measurin' mark. And the monsters you spied in the dark. Now I got no place in her heart. Let me go back to the start. I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. I got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper. I've got time on my hands. I'm just stripping paper
success,We used to go out walkin' hand in hand. You told me all the big things you had planned. It wasn't long till all your dreams came true. Success put me in second place with you. You have no time to love me anymore. Since fame & fortune knocked upon our door. I spend all my evenings all alone. Success has made a failure of our home. If we could spend an evening now & then. Perhaps we'd find true happiness again. You never hold me like you used to do. It's funny what success has done for you. You have no time to love me anymore. Since fame & fortune knocked upon our door. I spend all my evenings all alone. Success has made a failure of our home.
such unlikely lovers,"On a hot city day. When your white shirt turns to grey. That's when she'll arrive. When you look how you feel. Someone steps upon your heel. That's when she will come. Listen now. I'm not saying that there will be violins. But don't be surprised if they appear. Playing in some doorway. Still I can't believe that this is happening. We're such unlikely lovers. Though no one seems to notice as they hurry by. Ask me what I'm thinking, and I won't deny it. Can you believe it's happening?. Can you believe it's happening?. There were no magic spells. You can keep the flowers and bells. They just don't seem right. Can it actually be?. Me and you and you and me. Though we're like day and night. Listen now. I'm not saying that there will be violins. But don't be surprised if they appear. Playing in some doorway. Still I can't believe that this is happening. We're such unlikely lovers. Though no one seems to notice as they hurry by. Ask me what I'm feeling, and I won't deny it. Can you believe it's happening?. I am bewildered. Can you believe it's happening?. Somebody help me. Can you believe it's happening?."
suffering face,"Well, there's an old man's fantasy. Put in a young girl's mouth. Like cheap pink lipstick. Smeared on her wedding dress. Will you look what you've done to her. Will you look at this disgrace. Well, it's all over. Your suffering face. If we were chrome, we would be rusty. If we were thirst, we would be quenched. You don't need the same old rivet gun. You need a brand new wrench. Someone to pull you down on the ground. And cover you with kisses. Once I was the jewel of your heart. Now I'm only semi-precious. But if I seem so preoccupied. It's just my alibi--I'm all broken up inside. Even the words of love seem cruel and crass. When you're tough and transparent as armored glass. I prepared a bed for you. Then I sprayed perfume. Upon the wilted roses. That I'd scattered 'round the room. You came in gentle as a lamb. And turned into a terror. And you left your love and other threats. In the steam fading on my bathroom mirror. Well, it's an old man's fantasy. Put in a young girl's mouth. Like cheap pink lipstick. Smeared on her wedding dress. Will you look what you've done to me. Now you've put me in my place. Oh, it's all over. It's all over. It's all over. Your suffering face."
sugar won't work,Lightning Up!. And shake the ground. Is that a horn that's blowing?. Or a bell that's tolling?. Walls are falling. Ships pulled out from their mooring. Is that a river or just a road the storm has stolen?. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work. Lightning Up!. And fly the coop. Far from this tin-pan alley oop. Did you think I was your dupe?. I hear such lies and howlers. Words to pull out your molars. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work. Lightning Up!. Sugar the pill. A wall of ocean ten miles high. Metal darts torn from the sky. Like wanton boys make noise pull wings from flies. And this will predict the times these signs will bring. Me and my stupid heart. We were never apart. But now sugar won't work
suit of lights,"While Nat King Cole sings ""Welcome To My World"". You request some song you hate you sentimental fool. And it's the force of habit. If it moves then you fuck it. If it doesn't move you stab it. And I thought I heard ""The Working Man's Blues"". He went out to work that night and wasted his breath. Outside there was a public execution. Inside he died a thousand deaths. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they put him in a suit of lights. In the perforated first editions. Where they advocate the hangman's noose. Then tell the sorry tale of the spent Princess. Her uncouth escort looking down her dress. Anyway they say that she wears the trousers. And learnt everything that she does. And doesn't know if she should tell him yes. Or let him go. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they put him in a suit of lights. Well it's a dog's life in a rope leash or a diamond collar. It's enough to make you think right now. But you don't bother. For goodness sake as you cry and shake. Let's keep you face down in the dirt where you belong. And think of all the pleasure that it brings. Though you know that it's wrong. And there's still life in your body. But most of it's leaving. Can't you give us all a break. Can't you stop breathing. And I thought I heard ""The Working Man's Blues"". I went to work that night and wasted my breath. Outside they're painting tar on somebody. It's the closest to a work of art that they will ever be. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground. And they put him in a suit of lights."
sulky girl,"She wears a wedding ring her sister lent. To throw them off the scent. Just let them guess, it's what they expect. Who in the world has bitten her neck?. She's discovered wearing last night's dress. The carnal and cunning, she couldn't express. Who do you think she's trying to impress?. CHORUS:. I think you'd better hold your tongue. Although you've never been that strong. I'm sorry to say that I knew all along. You're no match for that sulky girl. She left her European town. Before she let the family down. She couldn't stand the Massacre Game. So she dyed her hair and adopted another name. With the evidence of passing out stamped on her hand. She glows in the dark. He thinks she's from another planet. CHORUS. Sulky girl. I'm sure you look a picture when you cry. Threatening the silent treatment doesn't qualify. It's like money in the bank. Your expression is blank. But while the chance appears. You'll be nearer to tears. Sulky girl [2x]. He said ""Hello, my pretty flower"". Just trying out his tycoon power. Avoiding the mirror, her pitying stare. She said ""You're mistaken, your money's no good in here"". Just some stupid little know-it-all. Who thought she looked easy; he's not that astute. He'll pay for the distance. Between cruelty and beauty. CHORUS. So I won't tell you again. What do you gain. By blackening her name. She's smarter than you. Oh isn't it a shame. You're gonna lose that sulky girl. Sulky girl. I saw you practising your blackmail faces. Suddenly you're talking like a duchess. But you're still a waitress. I saw through your pretence. But in my DEFENSE. There are a few events. I think will spare the censor."
sunday's best,"Sunday's Best. Times are tough for English babies. Send the army and the navy. Beat up strangers who talk funny. Take their greasy foreign money. Skin shop, red leather, hot line. Be prepared for the engaged sign. Bridal books, engagement rings. And other wicked little things. Chorus:. Standing in your socks and vest. Better get it off your chest. Every day is just like the rest. But Sunday's best. Stylish slacks to suit your pocket. Back supports and picture lockets. Sleepy towns and sleeper trains. To the dogs and down the drains. Major roads and ladies smalls. Hearts of oak and long trunk calls. Continental interference. At death's door with life insurance. Chorus. Sunday's best, Sunday's finest. When your money's in the minus. And you suffer from your shyness. You can listen to us whiners. Don't look now under the bed. An arm, a leg and a severed head. Read about the private lives. The songs of praise, the readers' wives. Listen to the decent people. Though you treat them just like sheep. Put them all in boots and khaki. Blame it all upon the darkies. Chorus. Sunday's best."
suspect my tears,"Do you remember how to say please?. You've had your own way for such a long time. Your lash is sweet now, I dry your cheek. You think I'm powerless when you weep. You may have something, I don't deny. You look too beautiful when you cry. If I seem unconcerned. Perhaps it's time you learned. I'll cry until you suspect my tears. I'll cry until you suspect my tears. You're not the only one who can turn it on. Where and when you need to. Do you remember how bad it felt?. Big eyes would fill up. That lip would tremble. You want to hurt me. Make me feel guilty. You always promise to lose control. I stole the trick that you used to play. I'm tired of you having it your own way. With the power to persuade. Beginning to cascade."
sweet dreams,"Sweet dreams of you, every night I go through. I should hate you girl the whole night through. Instead I'm having sweet dreams all about you. You don't love me it's plain. I should have known you'd never share my name. Why can't I forget you girl, start loving someone new?. Instead I'm having sweet dreams all about you. Why can't I forget my past, start loving someone new?. Instead I'm having sweet dreams all about you. Sweet dreams of you, every night I go through. I should hate you girl the whole night through. Instead I'm having sweet dreams all about you."
sweet pear,"Sweet pear, sweet pear. Those who say they love you would never dare. I'll watch out for you. I'll always be there. In the hour of distress you need not fear. In all the world there's only one true love. And finding it's hard enough. I bless whatever's in the sky above. For bringing you to me. But there's a void without your kiss. I wake on the precipice above the abyss. And though the touch of your lips these fears dismiss. Make no mistake there is an ache I have to live with. Was my grip too lose, my grip too strong. That made you want to run away. And now you're back where I pretend you belong. I wonder every night and day. How long. I swear this is my prayer. 'til we're burned and scattered in the atmosphere. Or lost in the world across a crowded room. I am your stupid lover, your wretched groom."
swine,You're a swine and I'm saying that's an insult to the pig. In the foul furrow that you dig. Why don't you lay your head down. In that unconsecrated ground. WAS she your MOTHER?. Or WAS she your bride. To defile and to blister. To gnaw at her side. Is this the end of the world?. Now that you've finished your life.
taking my life in your hands,"My dear impulsive darling I suspect my letter got to you too late. And it's really just a silly fragment of paper. But it means so much to those who wait. All the suffering days and nights 'til I dare dream again. There you suddenly stand and I'll be damned if you. didn't disappear with the dawn. Chorus:. Hours pass and darkness comes. Soon I will close my eyes. Will you return if you don't reply. You'll be taking my life in your hands. You'll be taking my life in your hands. Taking my life in your hands. I don't know why my dearest darling. I can't tell you how I feel when you are near. When I see you have returned my letters unopened. I will tear them up, your voice ringing in my ears. But you're kidding yourself if you think this. correspondence will end. I can always pretend words I don't have the courage to. send. Reach you."
talking in the dark,"I tried in vain to drive myself insane. I talk to myself but I don't listen. I found out what I was missing. I miss talking in the dark. Without you, I'm not conversational. Without the sense of the occasional. Without you, I miss talking in the dark. When the barking and the biting is through. We can talk like we're in love or talk like we're above it. We can talk and talk until we talk ourselves out of it. I look for the news, somebody to abuse. I look at myself but it's so chancy. I see things that I don't fancy. I miss talking in the dark. Without you, I'm not conversational. Without the sense of the occasional. Without you, I miss talking in the dark. Without you, I miss talking in the dark."
tart,"Hear silver trumpets will trill in the Arabic streets of Seville. Oranges roll in the gutter. And you pick them up. And peel back the skin. To the red fruit within. But the flavour is... Tart. And the flavour is.... Tart. Is it something you crave. And you say that you only feel bitterness. When you know it?s a lie, lie, lie?. Wild with a blackberry bush. there were blossoms of cherries to crush. There, at the edge of the asphalt tempting fingertips. They stain your hands, press too hard. They'll color your lips.... But the flavour is... Tart. And the flavour is.... Tart. Is it something you crave. 'Cos you say that you only feel bitterness. Would it kill you to show us a little sweetness?. Repeat chorus. Odd, where nothing else grows. It was something like love that she chose. Always a creature of habit. When pity would do. She wore down that heel with no feeling. She kept on her shoes. Repeat chorus. Nylon was hung from a peg. And a kohl black seam ran down her leg. Fishermen look for their nets. And send their regrets. But the bug lay there broken. She spoke, ""Is this some kind of joke?"". but the flavour is...."
tear off your own head (it's a doll revolution),"Who dries your eyes when you cry real tears?. Who knows or cares what an imitation is?. Only you do. You can paint his nails. Make him wear high heels. Why waste time altering the hemline?. Or do you?. Tear off your own head. Tear off your own head. It's a doll revolution. You can bat your lashes. You can cut your strings. You can pull his hair with your moveable fingers. It looks so real. If one won't do it, so collect the set. Dress him in pink ribbons. Put him in a kitchenette. How does this feel?. Tear off your own head. Tear off your own head. It's a doll revolution. What's that sound?. It will turn you around. It's a doll revolution. They're taking over. And they're tearing it down. It's a doll revolution. You can pull and pinch him. 'Till he cries and squeals. You can twist his body 'til it faces backwards. Those plastic features. You could make somebody a pretty little wife. But don't let anybody tell you how to live your life. Broken pieces. Tear off your own head. Tear off your own head. It's a doll revolution. Tear off your own head."
tears at the birthday party,"Think back now when we were young. There were always tears at the birthday party. You know how children can be. So cruel. That's how it starts, but. What if we never learn how to behave?. I did something, and you never forgave me. I never thought that it could be like this. But now I see. I see you share your cake with him. Unwrapping presents that I should have sent. What can I do?. Must I watch you?. Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles. So Happy Birthday again. And it's the same every year. Seems that I remember it as something more, but. You know how children can grow. So strange. I still adore you. What if we never learn from our mistakes?. But then, you'll never know how my heart aches. I never thought that it would be like this. But now I see. I see you share your cake with him. Unwrapping presents that I should have sent. What can I do?. Must I watch you?. Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles. So Happy Birthday again. Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles. So Happy Birthday again. One day I know he'll forget. To pay you the compliments you're after. You'll hang your sad, aching head. Behind a brittle smile or a shrill of laughter. What if we only get what we deserve?. Somehow I couldn't quite summon the nerve. Upon each anniversary. Then do you ever think of me?. Unwrapping presents that I should have sent. What can I do?. Must I watch you?. Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles. So Happy Birthday again. Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles. So Happy Birthday again. Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles. So Happy Birthday again. Close the door, dim the lights, blow out the candles. So Happy Birthday again."
tears before bedtime,I know the name on the tip of your tongue. And I know that accusing look. Everybody knows I've been so wrong. That's the problem and here's the hook. Tears before bedtime. There'll be trouble tonight. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I don't want to have another fight. I don't want to talk I don't want to fight. How wrong can I be before I am right. For the tears that you boo hoo hoo hoo. There can be no defence. You say you'll forgive and forget. But it's only a pretence. Either you can leave the past behind. Or give me something to disconnect my mind. I sleep with my fists clenched tight. When I don't lie awake all night. I guess time gave up the ghost too late. And the balance of our love. Very soon turns to hate. Darling your suspiciousness. Tortures me at night. But I can't excuse the cruel words. That I use whenever we fight. (chorus).
temptation,Who's this kid with his mumbo jumbo. Living in air-conditioned limbo. Though they treat him just like a guest. He's living under threat of arrest. Now that he's finally trying to make some sense. He drinks in self-defense. Give me temptation. The subtle touch of authority will. Take you anytime down to the station. You say that it's alright by me. Now you're living with the curse of sophistication. Now that you're shackled up to the rigmarole. With absolute control. I see you lying so wide awake. After I've given you all that you can take. So for heaven's sake. Give me temptation. Still you want to succeed so badly. Finding your life will not be deadly. You tell me you can take it or leave it. Sometimes I think that you really believe it. You're just itching to break her secret laws. As you go from claws to clause. Give me temptation. . .
that day is done,"I feel such sorrow, I feel such shame. I know I won't arrive on time. Before whatever out there is gone. What can I do, that day is done. It's just a promise that I made. I said I'd walk in her parade. Hot scalding tears I thought would flow. Still in my heart they'll never show. Chorus:. That day is done. That day is done. You know where I've gone I won't be coming back. That day is done. Well I recall the time and place. Where they announced her precious face. I thought at once my heart would burst. Still every time is like the first. There was applause as she stepped up. I wished that I could interrupt. I made no sign, I made no sound. I know I must stay underground. Chorus. That's why she walks, or so they say. She always knew just what I needed. But if she would just look my way. One time before they proceed. She sprinkles flowers in the dirt. That's when a thrill becomes a hurt. I know I'll never see her face. She walks away from my resting place."
the beat,"We're all going on a summer holiday. Vigilante's coming out to follow me.. Heard somebody say they're out to collar me.. Anybody wanna swallow me?. It takes two to tumble. It takes two to tango.. Speak up; don't mumble if you're in the combo.. On the beat, on the beat.. Till a man comes along and he says,. 'Have you been a good boy, never played with your toy?. Though you never enjoy, such pleasure to employ.'. See your friends in the state their in.. See your friends getting under their skin.. See your friends getting taken in.. Well, if you only knew the things you do to me.. I'd do anything to confuse the enemy.. There's only one thing wrong with you befriending me.. Take it easy. I think you're bending me.. I've been a bad boy with the standard leader.. My neighbor's revving up his Vauxhall Viva.. On the beat, on the upbeat.. Till a man comes along and he says,. 'Have you been a good boy, never played with your toy?. Though you never enjoy, such pleasure to employ.'. See your friends walking down the street.. See your friends never quite complete.. See your friends getting under their feet.. Oh, I don't want to disease you,. but I'm no good with machinery.. Oh, I don't wanna freeze you.. Stop looking at the scen'ry.. I keep thinking about your mother.. Oh, I don't wanna lick them.. I don't wanna be a lover.. I just wanna be your victim.. I don't go out much at night.. I don't go out much at all.. Did you think you were the only one. who was waiting for a call. On the beat, on the upbeat.. Till a man comes along and he says,. 'Have you been a good boy, never played with your toy?. Though you never enjoy, such pleasure to employ.'. See your friends treat me like a stranger.. See your friends despite all the arrangements.. See your friends Nothing here has changed.. Just the beat.."
the big light,"Well I had a little feeling to have a big night. And woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right. I had to face the who am I and where is she and what did I do. But worst of all I had to face the big light. <Chorus>. The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids. and it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did. I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications. And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration. When the hangover this morning had a personality. And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories. I didn't even touch the light switch so I knew I'd never see. The haggard face that would be staring back at me. <Chorus>. Well I had a little feeling to have a big time. And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime. I had to face the who am I and who is she and what did I do. But worst of all I had to face the big light. <Chorus>. Well, it's fine to go out and have a big night."
the birds will still be singing,"Summertime withers as the sun descends. He wants to kiss you. Will you condescend?. Before you wake and find a chill within your bones. Under a fine canopy of lover's dust and humourous bones. Banish all dismay. Extinguish every sorrow. Eternity stinks, my darling. That's no joke. Don't waste your precious time pretending you're. heartbroken. There will be tears and candles. Pretty words to say. Spare me lily-white lillies. With the awful perfume of decay. Banish all dismay. Extinguish every sorrow. If I'm lost or I'm forgiven. The birds will still be singing. It's so hard to tear myself away. Even when you know it's over. It's too much to say.. Banish all dismay. Extinguish every sorrow. If I'm lost or I'm forgiven."
the bridge i burned,"I'm walking down Times Square in the Electric Daylight. The sailors on shore leave stand out in their perfect white.. I'm up here with my spying glass at the window of the world. For better or for worse - it's a perverse universe, my love.. Now I know, I should have never walked over the bridge I burned. Now I know, somehow I don't feel so alone.. [the sermon]. You mutter underneath your breath - IT ECHOES ROUND THE WORLD. Everybody comes from nowhere.. There is hope, it loops up in the air. Now I know, I should have never walked over the bridge I burned. Now I know, somehow I don't feel so alone.. You said I used to be handsome if you screwed up your eyes. Professors and vampires drank up all the tears I cried.. Now there's a bird at my window, he feeds upon the pain. and sometimes he sings to me - a mocking bird in the twilight of infamy.. Now I know, I should have never walked over the bridge I burned. Now I know, somehow I don't feel so alone.. Now I know, I should have never walked over the bridge I burned. Now I know, they've burned one sinner and the others are set to follow. Now I know.. Now I know.."
the comedians,"I sat there alone upon the ferris wheel. A pastel-colored carriage in the air. I thought you'd leave me dangling for a little while. A silly twist upon a childish dare. Below I saw you whisper to another man. Who held the lever that could bring me down. He stopped the world from turning at your command. It's always something cruel when left to drown. Chorus. I can hardly hear the music from the carousel. The wind picks up, the carriage starts to sway. And one by one the lights go out, it's closing time. I see you take his hand and walk away. Walk away. They say that you are always the last to know. They say that all that glitters is not gold. It's not just that you're never coming back to me. It's the bitter way that I was told.."
the days take care of everything,"If you wanna feel sorry for yourself. Then go ahead, I'm not gonna stop you. Sometimes you're just like a petulant child. You seem to get so much satisfaction. Just from being denied. And now that he's taken. Everything you can give. You come to me asking. How can I continue to live. Chorus:. The days take care of everything. You've had your fling. You poor little thing. But don't despair. Yes the days take care of everything. You'll pass on the street. You'll know him from someplace. But you won't know where. The days take care of everything. We sat up all night and talked it through. You drank down the bottle. And I blew a lower note. I said "" Now I must be going now it' s getting late"". But what if I was less of a friend. And more of a traitor. But how could you know. How I was longing inside. Our eyes never met. And my hands stayed by my side. And as you gave me a rather. Affectionate kiss. How could you know. I had been waiting. For a chance like this. I've been an upstate conventional turn. I overheard a heavenly choir. And though you still turn to me. From time to time. One day you're up in the clouds. Next thing you're down with the. Sweet Adelines. And now I can see. It was not meant to be. You'll take him back. And never spare another thought. From me. Chorus"
the delivery man,"""Abel was able,"" so Vivian said. Her shoulders flung forward. Her lips in a purse. She talks like the beauty that she never was. Of the fabulous wild nights that she never has. In a certain light he looked like Elvis. In a certain way he feels like Jesus. Everyone dreams of him just as they can. But he's only the humble Delivery Man. Geraldine blushes and brushes away. The cigarette ashes that Vivian scatters. Stares out of the window at the things that she says. While gossip within her competes with the widow. Ever since he's gone, she feels like crying all the time. She knows for sure Vivian is lying. Now she has a daughter to raise as she can. She just wouldn't trust that Delivery Man. Ivy puts down the ghost story she's reading. Looks up at that face on the wall. Thinking about how her father lay bleeding. Shot in the back 'cos orders were misleading. And how a flag and a medal don't have any meaning. On the 5th of July as they tore down the fair. And he'd seen all the local girls who were worth kissing. With the smell of the gunpowder still in the air. They noticed that Abel and Ivy were missing. In a certain light he looked like Elvis. In a certain way he seemed like Jesus. He said ""Why can't we be kind to me like you were meant to be?. When they let me out, I had a brand new identity.. Now everyone dreams of me just as they can.. I want to be your Delivery Man."""
the deportees club,"In the Arrivederci Roma nightclub, bar and grill. Standing in the fiberglass ruins watching time stand still. All your troubles you confess to another faceless, backless dress. Schnapps, chianti, porter and ouzo. Pernod, vodka, sambuca--I love you so. Deportee. There's a tatty beauty talking in riddles. Rome burns down and everybody fiddles. Deportee. But a thousand dollars won't buy you a Yank, you wife, alas. There's a thousand years of history ground in this chaser glass. And how I wish that she was mine. I could have been the King in Six Eight Time. Deportee. Oh, it's a brittle charm, but she's had enough. Still she wrote her name upon his paper cuff. And you don't where to start or where to stop. All this pillow talk is nothing more than finally talking shop. When I came here tonight my pockets were overflowing. They took my return ticket without me even knowing. Well, I pray to the saints and all the martyrs. For the secret life of Frank Sinatra. But none of these things have come to pass. In America the law is a piece of ass. Deportee. So it's Schnapps, chianti, porter and ouzo. Pernod, vodka, sambuca--I love you so. Deportee. Deportee. Poor Deportee"
the element within her,"It's the element within her. Something under her skin. That is shining out through the face of the girl. Two sapphires and couple of rows of pearls. It's just a part of it. Like your fine tresses. You know what my guess is. La la la la la la la la la la la. He was a PLAYBOY. Could charm the birds right out of the trees. Now he says 'What do I do with these?'. La la la la la la la la la la la. This love in my heart. Let no-one set asunder. Sometimes I wonder. La la la la la la la la la la la. But back in the bedroom. With her electric heater. I SAY 'ARE YOU COLD?'. SHE SAYS 'NO, BUT YOU ARE LA'. ."
the fall of the world's own optimist,"There's no charity in you. And that surprises me. I guess I thought you were a golden idol. 'Cause I called you majesty. On the balustrade. You watched me hunt for tips I was obliged to pick up. From the passing trade. [Chorus:]. Hey, kids - look at this. It's the fall of the world's own optimist. I could get back up if you insist. But you'll have to ask politely. 'Cause the eggshells I've been treading. Couldn't spare me a beheading. And I'll know I had it coming. From a Caesar who was only slumming. Hey, kids - look at this. It's the fall of the world's own optimist. Well, I could have objections. Which you could override. But what's the point - we're only flogging the horse. When the horseman has up and died. Once I testified. And swore I'd never leave a stone unturned -. I bet you're really glad that I lied. [Chorus]. Hey, kids - look at this. It's the fall of the world's own optimist. I could get back up if you insist. But you'll have to ask politely. Yes, you'll have to ask politely. Yes, you'll have to ask"
the final mrs. curtain,"He was a plain piece of paper. An ordinary smith. The kind that you never. Trifle with. Drawn in wide-eyeliner. A solitary lass. Her beauty veiled by tortoiseshell. And tinted glass. She was a husband collector of. Impeccable taste. She said ""My hands are tied. But my glass is chaste"". He said, ""If I were him, I'd fill. That to the brim, so tell me more"". 'Cos that's the kind of talk. That I adore"". To lay with you. To lie with you. To live with you. Maybe die with you. As first love fades. Then two, then three. I'm certain to be. The Final Mrs. Curtain. There's not enough paper. There's not ink. There are not enough hours. Or poisons to drink. But there are too many. Teardrops still left to cry. And different kinds of kisses to. Help them dry. To lay with you. To lie with you. To live with you. Maybe die with you. As first love fades. Then two, then three. I'm certain to see. The Final Mrs. Curtain. To lay with you. To lie with you. To live with you. Maybe die with you. I'm the one who'll hold you. 'til we're through. The Final Mrs. Curtain"
the first to leave,"I should open with a kiss. For if you're reading this. You must have opened up your case. And found this letter where I placed it. In between the silk and lace. There were other clues, like your walking shoes. But I still refused to believe. That you were meant to be the first to leave. Everybody here sends you their love. How can I forget you still walk above. Or. below. Perhaps you'll never know this purgatory. We never could agree. There's a thought, there's a pause. No time to repent. Eternally yours. In a permanent lent. But if I should give you up. If you're right and life just stops. And I never see your face again. Then from unearthly pleasures, proud and plain. I shall abstain. Until you realise, my loss is your surprise. Unless you know otherwise. Then don't grieve."
the flirting kind,"She used to be the flirting kind. But the boy loved her anyway. He made up his mind. She said, What's a girl to do to be content?. Use your imagination. Time to experiment. Make love like a punishment. So they call her the flirting kind. The flirting kind. You better stop. Stop your running round. I got everything I wanted. I could make up for lost ground. With the flirting kind. The flirting kind. Your love is best. But I'll leave like the rest. The flirting kind. The flirting kind. They say that her fate is sealed. But she's much too beautiful to ever yield. She says, What's a girl to do to be content?. Use your imagination. Time to experiment. Make love like a punishment. So they call her the flirting kind. The flirting kind. She's crying in her sleep. For a man tone deaf. So is a man all over. He's all over, all over town. With the flirting kind. The flirting kind. Your love is best. But I'll leave like the rest. The flirting kind."
the great unknown,"They took old Danny Boy for a ride. From the arms of his bride to be. Threw him into the murky waters. By the dog biscuit factory. Quick dry the tears and stifle cheers. As he sinks just like a stone. Footprints set in sentimental cement. Now burden down his bones. Lest we forget. Here lies the Great unknown. My my my Delilah. Who's the butcher that you harbour. Take the rich man to the cleaners. And the strong man to the barber. From her face down to her torso. Sort of gruesome only more so. Hooks and eyes, fingers and thumbs. Ladies and gentlemen here she comes. The Great unknown. Where shall we sing. At a wedding or a wake. Whose name shall we cherish. And for whose sake. Now this year's cannon fodder. Tell the future general's jokes. They were keeping the home fires burning. As we slipped out for a smoke. Though the VIP's sang ""Wooden Heart"". The band played ""Hearts of Oak"". (Chorus). And here comes the day I shall perish all alone."
the greatest thing,EVERYONE STOPPED WHEN SHE WALKED INTO THE ROOM. Isn't this the greatest thing. Everyone own up but nobody could touch her. Isn't this the greatest thing. PUNCH THE CLOCK keep boxing clever. You'll be young enough for ever. Isn't this the greatest thing. Isn't this THE GREATEST THING. I heard some new confection. Said we can't afford to feel affection. And it's the lastest thing. In and out of matrimony. Never once removed the Sony. 'Cos it's a status thing. So girls like that above described. Are not to be so easily bribed. With a white frock and a ring. PUNCH THE CLOCK and in time you'll get pulled apart. IF YOU'RE MARRIED ON PAPER AND NOT IN YOUR HEART. But I won't be told that life with the one you love is sordid. Just because some authority says you can't afford it. Since nights were long and days were olden. Woman to man has been beholden. But since then times have been changing. She sends back HIS TRIBUTE OF A ROSE. And says this ring is better suited for the nose. He's always fingering. I PUNCH THE CLOCK and it's OK. I KNOW A GIRL WHO TAKES MY BREATH AWAY. And it's the greatest. And it's the greatest thing
the imposter,Trying to be too bad. Trying to talk too tough. Trying to jack the lad. You'd think he'd had enough. But he's not the man you'd think that he can be. I just don't know why you can't see. That he is only the imposter. That he is only the imposter. You've never been this far. You've always been too smart. And you know all our boys. Are really girls at heart. But he's not.... When I said that I was lying I might have been lying. Never let me hear you say you're not trying. This is your big decision. Hope you're not disappointed. He's got double vision. When you want him double jointed. And he's not.... He'll only bring you souvenirs. It's only gonna end in tears. And he is only the imposter. .
the invisible man,I WAS COMMITTED TO LIFE AND THEN COMMUTED TO THE OUTSKIRTS. With all the love in the world. Living for thirty minutes at a time with a break in the middle for adverts. But it's a wonderful world within these cinema walls. WHERE A SHOWER OF AFFECTION BECOMES NIAGARA FALLS. And you wish she could step down from the screen to your seat in the stalls. BUT IF STARS ARE ONLY PAINTED ON THE CEILING ABOVE. Then who can you turn to and who do you love. I want to get out while I still can. I want to be like Harry Houdini. Now I'm the invisible man. My head is spinning round faster and faster. Here I stand on the edge of disaster. I'm shattered like a piece of crystal porcelain or alabaster. Crowds surround loudspeakers hanging from the lampposts. Listening to the murder mystery. Meanwhile someone's hiding in the classroom. Forging books of history. NEVER MIND THERE'S A GOOD FILM SHOWING TONIGHT. WHERE THEY HANG EVERYONE EVERYBODY WHO CAN READ AND WRITE.
the judgement,"The accused will rise to be torn in two. guilty of nothing but loving you. this is the judgement. And I'm willing to plead. how you don't want me. hoping this torment will cease. Will I be released?. There'll be lies, there'll be tears. a jury of your peers. with a pitiful lack of experience. Hand down the judgement. And if I done wrong. and loved you too long. Stand up and just testify. How can I deny?. Objection overruled. I wait for my reprieve. with the trust of the deceived. the wisdom of the fool. It's his sorrowful face. too heavy for his head. cos he bowed it as something come over him. it was the judgement. He falls to his knees. Have mercy on me. He clings to the hem of her gown."
the king of the unknown sea,"(Words: Costello, music: Michael Thomas). Beneath the turquoise pools and emerald jewels. There lie the broken spines of seven ships. The skulls of careless fools and coins of gold. Pour from the banks that proffer puckered lips. I am the king of all of you. The timid land. The unknown sea. And all that lies between. So then come away you frail of breath. You feeling tired of life. And scared of death. You stain the air with your half hearted wit. A few steps more will make an end of it. -Chorus. She'll wander on a strand of dying light. She'll wonder who may answer whispered prayers. The coral and the pearl that hold you tight. May grace the throat of those the ocean spares."
the letter home,"c/0 St. Ignatus House, Willoughby Drive, Parrametta,. New South Wales. This fifth day of July, in the year of Our Lord nineteen. hundred and thirty five. Why must I apologize every time that I sit down to write. Through my own fault I may find. You're no longer living at this address. Please excuse the lack of news. The feeling of strange privilege. for the hour of trial, in these times of distress. Mean more than years imprisoned by etiquette.. I can remember when we were children. Though I could never imagine this day. Your brother told me we'd live forever. ""I'll go one better,"" I heard myself say. And it seems so strange, now that he's gone to recall all these. games. While the years have divided us. Friendships have strained and broken. Oh, by the way, how's that girl that you wed. I hated you then, but I'm over the worst of it. I can't come home, I might as well say, life is short. I shall not write again."
the long division,"Did somebody try to catch your eye. And almost change your sad expression?. Did somebody's hand linger too long?. Must I now make my confession?. But you'll never know. What suspicion is. Until you lie awake. And every night you ask yourself. ""What am I to do?"". Can it be so hard to calculate?. When three goes into two. There's nothing left over. How's it gonna feel? This time it's real. It's not a temporary fracture. This is what you get, the stage is set. For you and your attempted rapture. Is he gonna smile. That indulgent smile. When you come running home?. And every night you ask yourself,. ""What am I to do?"". Can it be so hard to calculate?. When three goes into two. There's nothing left over. What am I gonna say? You turn away. And you leave me here despairing. What am I going to do? I look at you. You seem to be so long past caring. Did somebody say,. ""Can we still be friends?"". Only to find out now that it's a joke. So ask yourself,. ""What am I to do?"". Can it be so hard to calculate?. When three goes into two. There's nothing left over. Did somebody say,. ""Can we still be friends?"". Did somebody say,. ""Can we still be friends?"". Did somebody say,. ""Can we still be friends?"". Did somebody say,. ""Can we still be friends?"". Did somebody say,. ""Can we still be friends?"". Did somebody say,. ""Can we still be friends?""."
the long honeymoon,All the bedroom lights go out. As the neighbourhood gets quiet. Everything in heaven and earth is almost right. But there's a wife whos wondering where her husband could be tonight. And when the phone rang only once she took a dreadful fright. Little things just seem to undermine her confidence in him. He was late this time last week. Who can she turn to when the chance of coincidence is slim. 'Cause the baby isn't old enought to speak. There's been a long honeymoon. She thought too late and spoke too soon. There's no money back guarantee on future happiness. There's been a long honeymoon. If he's out on a date then her life's in ruins. She never thought her love could ever be as strong as this. All the movies and the papers. Feature the murders of lonely women. If he isn't in by ten she'll call up her best friend. Why doesn't he come home. Why does her friends phone keep on ringing. Maybe she should just pretend. (chorus).
the loved ones,Don't get smart or sarcastic. He snaps back just like elastic. Spare us the theatrics and the verbal gymnastics. We break wise guys just like matchsticks. What would the loved ones say. Your pride and joy is all blown up. What would the loved ones say. The bride and boy are barely grown up. You're not my particular poison. I've got nothing against you myself. You could have been a danger to the boys and girls. Now you're a danger to yourself. Oh what would the loved ones say. What would the loved ones say. Oh what would the loved ones say. What would the loved ones say. The ugly little scenes run round your bed. The ugly little dreams you get the needle and no thread. They stitched you up this time. They say you'll do. They bitch about your pretty face turning ugly on you. The butcher the baker and the bassline maker. Say you can leave her I can take her. You live your whole life like a minute or two later. One day its going to end sooner than greater. What would the loved ones say. He'll be remembered young and pretty. What would the loved ones say. Now he's a hit in every city. Now there's a name well never forget. There's one born every minute. Dont pin a medal on me yet. They might be waiting for you. (chorus). PPS I love you.
the name of this thing is not love,"There's a part of this feeling that I just cannot kill. But the name of this thing is not love. And I can't take a potion, and I won't take a pill. So it tortures me still. But the name of this thing is not love. Then you start entertaining such a terrible thought. Life is so very short. And the name of this thing is not love. There's a bruise on her arm. And some blood on the floor. But the name of this thing is not love. And they're taunting some girl. That they claim to adore. She can't take anymore. But the name of this thing is not love. Who in the world do you think that you are?. That you pushed me this far. But the name of this thing is not love. He thinks of her still. Although you'd never guess. He's trying so to forget her. The occasional moments that he'll always bless. Watching her dress. For worse or better. He watched her pick over her broken playthings. What played on his mind is not love. The cast aside tokens and discarded rings. Over one of his flings. But the name of this thing is not love. Then he threw something down in the wild rushing river. And won't ever recover. But the name of this thing is not love. Then you start out pretending that you're so very tough. Life is not short enough. But the name of this thing is not love"

the night before larry was stretched,"The Night Before Larry Was Stretched. . Oh, the night before Larry was stretched. Well the boys they all paid him a visit. A bit in their sacks too they fetched. For they sweated their duds till they ris' it. For Larry was always the lad. When a boy was condemned to the Squeezer. Would fence all the duds that he had. For to help his poor friend to a sneezer--. -- And warm his ol' gob 'fore he died. Well the boys they came crowding in fast. And they threw all their stools 'round about him. Six glims round his trap-case was placed. For he couldn't be well-waked without them. When one of them asked, ""Could he die. Without having duly repented?"". Said Larry, ""That's all in me eye. And first by the clergy invented--. --For to get a fat bit for themselves"". ""Oh and I'll be cut up like a pie:. And me nob from me body be parted.. You're in the wrong box, then, says I,. For blast me if they're so hard-hearted. ""A chalk on the back of your neck. Is all that Jack Catch dares to give you. Then mind not such trifle's affect. Oh why should the likes of them grieve you?--. --And now boys, come tip us the deck."". Well the cards being called for they played. Until Larry found one of them cheated. A point in his napper was made. For the boy he'd been easily heated. ""Oh, hold me the hokey, you thief!. I'll scuttle your knob with me dodle!. You cheat me because I'm in grief. Ah, but soon I'll demolish your noddle--. --And leave you your claret to drink"". Then the clergy came in with his book. And he spoke him so smooth and so civil. Larry tipped him kill-sour look. And he pitched his big wig to the devil. Then sighing he threw back his head. For to get a sweet drop of the bottle. And dutiful sighing he said,. ""Oh the hempt 'twill be soon 'round me throttle--. --And choke me poor windpipe to death.. ""Oh then sure it's the best way to die. Oh the dead are no better the living. For now when the gallows is high. Our journey is shorter to heaven."". But what harasses Larry the most. And makes his soul poor melancholy. Is he thinks of the time when his ghost. It will come in a sheet to Sweet Molly--. --""Oh sure, it'll kill her alive"". So moving, these last words he spoke. We all vented our tears in a shower. For me own part I thought me heart broke. For to see him cut down like a flower. On his travels we watched him next day. The throttler I thought I could kill him. But Larry not one word did say. Nor change did he come to King William--. --And then did his color grow white.. When he came to the old Dublin Chit. He was tucked up so neat and so pretty. The rumbler jugged off from his feet. And he died with his face to the city. He kicked too, but that was all pride. For soon you might see 'twas all over. Soon after the noose was untied. In darkness we waked him in clover--. --And sent him to take his ground sweat. Oh, the night before Larry was stretched. Well the boys they all paid him a visit. A bit in their sacks too they fetched. For they sweated their duds till they ris' it. For Larry was always the lad. When a boy was condemned to the Squeezer. Would fence all the duds that he had. For to help his poor friend to a sneezer--. --And warm his ol' gob 'fore he died."
the only daddy that'll,"Everybody knows you been steppin' on my toes. And I'm gettin pretty tired of it. Keep steppin' outta line and messin' with my mind. If you had any sense, you'd quit. But ever since you were just a little bitty girl. Since I was the only man in this whole world. Now you better do some thinking then you'll find. You got the only daddy that'll walk the line. I keep workin' everyday, all you wanna do is play. I'm sick of stayin' out all night. You've been coming unglued from your funny little moods. So, honey-baby, that ain't right. 'Cause ever since you were just a little bitty girl. Since I was the only man in this whole world. Now you better do some thinking then you'll find. You got the only daddy that'll walk the line. Everybody knows you been steppin' on my toes. And still just puttin' me on. When I start-a-walkin', don't I hear you start-a-squawkin'. Beggin' me to come back home. 'Cause ever since you were just a little bitty girl. Since I was the only man in this whole world. Now you better do some thinking then you'll find."
the only flame in town,I know a girl got my mind in a mess. I never heard her say goodnight and God bless. She's not the only flame in town. And when we're alone we never quarrel. I'm miles away now here's the moral. She's not the only flame in town. She's not the only flame in town. She's got to stop thinking that I'm. carrying this torch around. He struck a match and it lit up her face. We should have struck a match girl. To burn down the whole place. Now you're not the only flame in town. But you blew hot and cold. Turned my heart to a cinder. And with each passing day. You'd be less tender and more tinder. Now you're not the only flame in town. She's not the only flame in town. She's got to stop thinking that I'm. carrying this torch around. Thought I saw your face in the fire. But it's so hard to remember. Even an inferno can cool down to an ember. Now you're not the only flame. You're not the only flame. You're not the only flame in town. .
the other end (of the telescope),"Shall we agree that just this once. I'm gonna change my life. Until it's just as tiny or important as you like?. And in time we won't even recall that we spoke. Words that turned out to be as big as smoke. As smoke that disappears in the air. There's always something that's smoldering somewhere. I know it don't make a difference to you. But oh! It sure made a difference to me. You'll see me off in the distance, I hope. At the other end. At the other end of the telescope.. The promise of indulgence in my confidential voice. Approached immortal danger but you'll never know how close. Then down the hall I overheard such a heavenly choir. They interrupted my evil designs. One day you are up in the clouds. The next thing you're down with the Sweet Adelines. (Chorus). Lie down baby now don't say a word. There there baby your vision is blurred. Your head is so sore from all of that thinking. I don't want to hurt you now. But I think you're shrinking. You're half-naked ambition and you're half out of your wits. Or several tiny fractions that this portrait still omits. And it's so hard to pick the receiver up when I call. I never noticed you could be so small. The answer was under your nose but the question never arose. I know it don't make a difference to you. But oh! It sure made a difference to me. 'Cause late in the evening as I sit here moping. With a bamboo needle on a shellac of Chopin. And the cast-iron heart that you failed to tear open. At the other end. At the other end of the telescope."
the other side of summer,"The sun struggles up another beautiful day. And I felt glad in my own suspicious way. Despite the contradiction and confusion. Felt tragic without reason. There's malice and there's magic in every season. CHORUS. From the foaming breakers of the poisonous surf. The other side of Summer. To the burning forests in the hills of Astroturf. The other side of Summer. The automatic gates close up between the shanties and the palace. The blowtorch amusements, the voodoo chalice. The pale pathetic promises that everybody swallows. A teenage girl is crying 'cos she don't look like a million dollars. So help her if you can. 'Cos she don't seem to have the attention span. CHORUS. Was it a millionaire who said ""imagine no possessions""?. A poor little schoolboy who said ""we don't need no lessons""?. The rabid rebel dogs ransack the shampoo shop. The pop princess is downtown shooting up. And if that goddess if fit for burning. The sun will struggle up the world will still keep turning. Madman standing by the side of the road saying. ""Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, look at my eyes, look at my eyes"". Now you can't afford to fake all the drugs your parents used to take. Because of their mistakes you'd better be wide awake. CHORUS. The mightiest rose. The absence of perfume. The casual killers. The military curfew. The cardboard city. And the unwanted birthday. The other side of summer. The dancing was desperate, the music was worse. They bury your dreams and dig up the worthless. Goodnight. God bless. And kiss ""goodbye"" to the earth."
the people's limousine,"It's a chilly Florentine evening. Two men in evening hats. Telling tales of the underground and. fishing for Reds. Policemen armed with Uzis. stand guard but they don't speak. Ain't seen no Michaeangelo. he'll be here next week.. The girl in the shoes. with the crystal heels went chaperoned by her brother. They raise a glass of amber wine. take pictures of each other. of the policemen in the fountains. and the sickle and the hammer. and they came with Uncle Romulus. with his walking cane and camera. She looked like someone's girlfriend. she looked like a dream. she looked as unlikely. as the people's limousine.. Come and sit by me, girl, before I breathe the breath out of you. Hush your mouth and cover your eyes for I'll tell your father of you. He paid to have you painted in the company of angels. Only to find you flirting anew with Chico Marx and perverted Engels. The patron saint of television smiles down from the shelf. Romulus can't criticize but he can't bless himself. He has a tin of pea-green paint and a big roll of black tape. To vandalize these obscenities then make his escape. She walked up to the nice policeman and asked him for a match. He saw Romulus approaching and slipped off the safety catch. Then cut down her uncle, he was painted red and green."
the puppet has cut his strings,"They pulled the stars down one by one. Hauled up the moon to shine upon. A velvet curtain rising. Now her puppet has cut his strings. The footlights glare. The trumpets blare. Why is your face drawn on so glum, old chum. Paintbrush dragging on a drum. The rimshot on the punchline that you fumbled. The crowd went home and left you. For dead. My old woodenhead. Took the thimble and the thread. Choked back tears like a cymbal. The breath is slow and shallow too. The sky is bright Venetian blue. The cardboard sun is all ablaze. The air is painted Clifford Brown. Caressing ""Yesterdays"". The steady gaze of your glass eye. Head in a basket smiling still. Free of will, free of wisdom. Can't feel my fingers anymore. Can't raise my hand and ask for more. Dance my doll across the floor. Or fire a flag from a pistol. (""Bang""). They pulled the stars down one by one. Hauled up the moon to wish upon. The puppet finally cut his strings. And free at last from earthly things. He's dancing on the ceiling. With a showgirl in a feather dress. Time is meaningless. We carried you on buckled limbs. Through mournful airs and martyrs hymns. Then one blue and one more yellow pill. One keeps you quiet. One keeps you still. You sang ""The Way You Looked Tonight"". Your voice is ringing true and clear. Then you wore them down like candlelight. And in the darkness. You'd best beware. And in the darkness. You'd best beware. You'd best beware. You'd best beware. I used to love him. When I used to care. Canopy. Satin trim. Slowly closing. The puppet has cut his strings"
the scarlet tide,Well I recall his parting words. Must I accept his fate?. Or take myself far from this place. I thought I heard a black bell toll. A little bird did sing. Man has no choice. When he wants everything. [Chorus:]. We'll rise above the scarlet tide. That trickles down through the mountain. And separates the widow from the bride. Man goes beyond his own decision. Gets caught up in the mechanism. Of swindlers who act like kings. And brokers who break everything. The dark of night was swiftly fading. Close to the dawn of the day. Why would I want him. Just to lose him again. [Chorus 2x]

the sweetest punch,"You only saw red. After I said, ""How can we continue?"". Hidden from your view. In the blue corner that I painted myself into. Then we started to fight. And it changed everything. Here's the ring. You dropped the band, I can't understand it. Not after all we've been through. Words start to fly, my glass jaw and I. Will find one to walk right into. You knocked me out. It was the sweetest punch. The bell goes.... I can hear it ringing, but I didn't see it coming. We all say things we don't mean. You can't take it back. Now the room is spinning, but was I the last to notice?. I can see I'll never win. So if you're going. Then you better go to him. Then you better go to him. I only saw stars. I dropped my guard, and that's how it ended. What was I to do. In the blue corner where I seemed to hang suspended?. Then with seconds to go. You delivered the blow. Here I go. You dropped the band, I can't understand it. Not after all we've been through. Words start to fly, my glass jaw and I. Will find one to walk right into. You knocked me out. It was the sweetest punch. The bell goes.... I can hear it ringing, but I didn't see it coming. We all say things we don't mean. You can't take it back. Now the room is spinning, but was I the last to notice?. I can see I'll never win. So if you're going. Then you better go to him. Then you better go to him."
the unfailing welcome to the voice,(Costello/Nieve). Above the tears. Before the scream. Invisible and secret scar. The true salvation is the human voice. Beloved voices of the past. The forever stiffled voice. Tender echoes. Lost cause. Miserable voice. Whispering voice. Incantations. Immaterial instrument. Attentive mothers. Darkness lighting lullabies. Stare of silence. Cruel disease. The ________ gag of hate. Unfailing welcome to the voice. Be welcome. Attractive red fruit of the mouth. Dangerous message on my skin. I feel so fluid. Lighter than air. Shy caress. A fleeting bride's veil on the throat. Forbidden kisses to drink. _______ siren. Virtuous sound. Vocal pleasure. Pleasure vocal. It's the real way to be drunk. To desert the common place. Sacred [bluesy prophet?]. I'm a slave to the voice. Unfailing welcome to the voice. In every tone a poignant oath. Voices to pray to fly to escape. [harmonized]. The sublimation of the hopes. The sublimation of the hopes. Spiritual vehicle of thought. The voice [is boundless?]. I love the voice.
the very thought of you,The very thought of you. And I forget to do. The little ordinary things. That everyone ought to do. I'm living in a kind of daydream. I'm happy as a king. And foolish though it may seem to me. That's everything. The mere idea of you. The longing year for you. You'll never know how slow the moments go. Till I'm near to you. I see your face in every flower. Your eye in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you. My love. The mere idea of you. The longing year for you. You'll never know how slow the moments go. Till I'm near to you. I see your face in every flower. Your eye in stars above. It's just the thought of you. The very thought of you.
the world and his wife,The family circle gather round from very far and near. To pass around the same remarks they passed away last year. The little girl you dangle on your knee without mishap. STIRS SOMETHING IN YOUR MEMORY. AND SOMETHING IN YOUR LAP. But it's a living. This is the life. For the world and his wife. The world and his wife. The kissing cousins slip outside to cuddle and confess. She says sweet nothing at all it's much more of a mess. The conversation melts like chocolate down their open jaws. As the juniper berry slips down just like last night's drawers. To tell the truth our Mum ran off with someone else's father. WENT FOR TWO WEEKS' HOLIDAY IN TARAMASALATA. Daddy went out with the rubbish and he kept on walking. Between Mum and the walls. God only knows who does the talking. But later on in the evening through the tears and fol de rol. Come the sentimental feelings for the lure of vitriol. Longing thoughts go hankering for the old home overseas. WITH A BLINDFOLD AND A NATIONAL ANTHEM. SUNG IN DIFFERENT KEYS.
the world and his wife (live),"(Alternate Slower Version, Submitted by Craig Ciccone). The family circle gathers 'round from very far and near. To pass around the same remarks they passed away last year. The little girl you dangled on your knee without mishap. Stirs something in your memory and something in your lap. (Chorus). The juniper berry has a very deadly kiss. I would say that something here is very much amiss. But it's a living and this is the life. For the world and his wife. The world and his wife. The kissing cousins step outside to cuddle and confess. She says sweet nothing at all, it's much more of a mess. She says, ""Our Mother and someone else's Father. Went for two weeks holiday in Tarmasalata."". Daddy went out the rubbish and he kept on walking. Between Mum and the walls, God only knows who does the talking. Chorus. The conversation melts like chocolate down our open jaws. Through the loud appeal of laughter and the counting of [?]. And later on in the evening, through the tears and fol de rol. Come the sentimental feelings for the lure of vitriol. Longing thoughts go hankering for the old home overseas. With a blindfold and a national anthem sung in different keys."
the world of broken hearts,"Every night you'll find me in the only world I own.. It's a crowded place that's filled with people all alone.. It's a place that I could write a book about.. When they let you in, you'll find there's no way out.. There you don't get in, 'cause there's no way out. There's just no way out.. No way out when your in a world of broken hearts,. in a world of broken hearts,. of broken hearts,. of broken hearts.. Those who enter here are told to leave their dreams behind.. You may never get to sleep again, but you don't mind.. It's a place that I could write a book about.. When they let you in, you'll find there's no way out.. There you don't get in, 'cause there's no way out. There's just no way out.. No way out when your in a world of broken hearts,. in a world of broken hearts,. of broken hearts,. of broken hearts..

there won't be anymore,"Don't wait for the telephone if you want a call from me. There won't be anymore, there won't be anymore. And don't wait for the mailman if you want a letter from me. There won't be anymore, there won't be anymore. All the love we had until you turn back. And it broke my lovin' heart in two. When you're heart is breakin' and you want some lovin' from me. There won't be anymore, it won't be like before. It won't be like before, there just won't be anymore. All the love we had until you turn back. And it broke my lovin' heart in two. When you're heart is breakin' and you want some lovin' from me. There won't be anymore, it won't be like before."
there's a story in your voice,"Once upon another time. If you had the need. I'd step right in the shoes that you've been walking. 'Cos someone put the hurt in you. For every one to see. And you only have to speak to tell your fortune. There's a story in your voice. Both by damage and by choice. It tells of promises and pleasure. And a tale of wine and woe. The uneasy time to come. And the long way 'round we go to get there. Once you told me fairytales. Everybody knows. But I didn't care for their prediction. Now you say you're leaving me. And packing up your clothes. I finally see you were a work of fiction. There's a story in your walk. Then you crumble just like chalk. And I could say that I was sorry. But I wouldn't mean it much. There are pages I can't touch. And something that's been torn out of this chapter. Far away, not far enough. 'Cos I can still recall. How it felt when I read that last sentence. Now I go inside some rooms with Gideon in them all. And hide myself from all hope of repentance. There's a story in your eyes. Cheap sunglasses might disguise. But when the bedroom light reveals. All that bravado and that fright. That you cover up in spite. Attempts to strip away this fabrication. There's a story in your voice. Both by damage and by choice. It tells of promises and pleasure. And a tale of wine and woe. The uneasy time to come. And the long way 'round we go to get there"
they'll never take her,"If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares. There is one who's smiling face the gods would see. For she'll walk along beside me up the golden stairs. Oh, they'll never, never take her love from me. What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave. And see her love turn into sympathy. It's the one regret I carry with me to my grave. Oh, they'll never, never take her love from me. I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness. That we shared together in the used to be. Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress. But, they'll never, never take her love from me. I thought I would make her happy if I stepped aside. But I knew her love would never set me free. And even on the morning she became another's bride. I said, ""They'll never, never take her love from me.""."
this house is empty now,"These rooms play tricks upon you. Remember when they were always filled with laughter?. But now they're quite deserted. They seem to just echo voices raised in anger. Maybe you will see my face. Reflected there on the pane. In the window of our poor. Forlorn and broken home. Still this house is empty now. There's nothing I can do. To make you want to stay. So tell me how. Am I supposed to live without you?. These walls were lined with pictures. Remember the glass we charged in celebration?. But now I fill my life up. With all that I can to deaden this sensation. Do you recognize the face. Fixed in that fine silver frame. Were you really so unhappy then?. You never said. So this house is empty now. There's nothing I can do. To make you want to stay. So tell me how. Am I supposed to live without you?. Oh, if I could just become forgetful. When night seems endless. Does the extinguished candle care. About the darkness?. It's funny how my mem’ry. Will bring you so close then make you disappear. Meanwhile all our friends must choose. Who they will favour, who they will lose. Hang the garland high or close the door. And throw away the key. This house is empty now. There's no one living here. You have to care about. This house is empty now. There's nothing I can do. To make you want to stay. So tell me how. Am I supposed to live without you?. This house is empty now. There's no one living here. You have to care about. This house is empty now. There's nothing I can do. To make you want to stay. So tell me how. Am I supposed to live without you?."
this is hell,"This Is Hell. . CHORUS:. This is hell, this is hell. I am sorry to tell you. It never gets better or worse. But you get used to it after a spell. For heaven is hell in reverse. The bruiser spun a hula hoop. As all the barmen preen and pout. The neon ""i"" of nightclub flickers on and off. And finally blew out. The irritating jingle. Of the belly-dancing phony Turkish girls. The eerie glare of ultra violet. Perfect dental work. CHORUS. The failed Don Juan in the big bow-tie. Is very sorry that he spoke. For he's mislaid his punch line. More than halfway through a very tasteless joke. The fré‹Ÿlein caught him peeking down her gown. He's yelling in her ear. And all at once the music stopped. As he was intimately bellowing ""My dear . ."". CHORUS. The shirt you wore with courage. And the violent nylon suit. Reappear upon your back. And undermine the polished line you try to shoot. It's not the torment of the flames. That finally see your flesh corrupted. It's the small humiliations that your memory piles up. This is hell, this is hell, this is hell.. ""My Favourite Things"" are playing. Again and again. But it's by Julie Andrews. And not by John Coltrane. Endless balmy breezes and perfect sunsets framed. Vintage wine for breakfast. And naked starlets floating in Champagne. All the passions of your youth. Are tranquillized and tamed. You may think it looks familiar. Though you may know it by another name. CHORUS."

this sad burlesque,I write in hopes that by the time you get this letter. We may live to see a change for the better. Or are we so devoted to these wretched selfish motives. When the cold facts and figures all add up. They cannot contradict this sad burlesque. This sad burlesque. With miserable failures making entertainment of our fate. Laughter cannot dignify of elevate. This sad burlesque. Now can they recall being young and idealistic. Before wading knee-deep in hogwash and arithmetic. The pitying smirk. The argument runs like clockwork. Will run down eventually and splutter to a stop. P.S. Well by now you know the worst of it. And we've heard all the alibis that they've rehearsed. The smug predictions. If it's not a contradiction. Keep faith in human nature. And have mercy on the creatures in this sad burlesque.
this year's girl,"See her picture in a thousand places. 'Cause she's this year's girl. You think you all own little pieces. Of this year's girl. Forget your fancy manners. Forget your English grammar. 'Cause you don't really give a damn. About this year's girl. Still you're hoping that she's well spoken. 'Cause she's this year's girl. You want her broken with her mouth wide open. 'Cause she's this year's girl. Never knowing it's a real attraction. All these promises of satisfaction. While she's being bored to distraction. Being this year's girl. Time's running out. She's not happy with the cost. There'd be no doubt. Only she's forgotten much more than she's lost. A bright spark might corner the market. In this year's girl. You see yourself rolling on the carpet. With this year's girl. Those disco synthesizers. Those daily tranquilizers. Those body building prizes. Those bedroom alibis. All this, but no surprises for this year's girl. All this, but no surprises for this year's girl. All this, but no surprises for this year's girl."
tiny steps,"Muscle baby won't let go. Weekend baby won't say no. Is she an active beauty ?. I should say so. Wooden bones and pretty lashes. Iodine for your baby's gashes. Little tombs for your baby's ashes. If something goes wrong. Tiny steps almost real. Tiny fingers you almost feel. Make her walk or make her kneel. Oh, she's almost human beneath that Cuban heel. Who's that down at the bottom of the garden ?. Who's that hiding underneath the sofa ?. Who gets blamed whenever you're in trouble ?. She's your friend and she's your double. Tiny steps almost real. Tiny fingers you almost feel. Make her walk or make her kneel. Oh, she's almost human beneath that Cuban heel. Pretty little fashion face. Pick anyone up off the shelf. Though you say it's a disgrace. You know you owe it to yourself. You can even shop around. Though you won't find any cheaper. She's your baby now. You can keep her. Tiny steps almost real. Tiny fingers you almost feel. Make her walk or make her kneel. Oh, she's almost human beneath that Cuban heel. ."
tko (boxing day),You can run all you like from the classroom or the cot. From a great big man or a tiny tot. But from this day everyday will be BOXING DAY. Don't need your indecision let there be no doubt. Don't need you permission I can count you out. TKO. They put the numb into number they put the cut into cutie. They put the slum into slumber and the boot into beauty. But from this day everyday will be BOXING DAY. It's a fight to the finish let there be no doubt. As the seconds turn into minutes I can count you out. TKO. You need a back to break or a back to stab. NOW YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT LOOKS DULL AND DRAB. But from this day everyday will be BOXING DAY.

tokyo storm warning,"The sky fell over cheap Korean monster-movie scenery. And spilled into the mezzanine of the crushed capsule hotel. Between the Disney abattoir and the chemical refinery. And I knew I was in trouble but I thought I was in hell. So you look around the tiny room and you wonder where the hell you are. While the K.K.K. convention are all stranded in the bar. They wear hoods and carry shotguns in the main streets of Montgomery. But they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday. Chorus: What do we care if the world is a joke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). We'll give it a big kiss. We'll give it a poke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke. (Tokyo Storm Warning). We're only living this instant. The black sand stuck beneath her feet in a warm Sorrento sunrise. A barefoot girl from Naples or was it a Barcelona hi-rise. Whistles out the tuneless theme song on a hundred cheap suggestions. And a million false seductions and all those eternal questions. Chorus. So they flew the Super-Constellation all the way from Rimini. And feasted them on fish and chips from a newspaper facsimile. Now dead Italian tourists bodies litter up the Broadway. Some people can't be told you know they have to learn the hard way. Holidays are dirt-cheap in the Costa del Malvinas. In the Hotel Argentina they can hardly tell between us. For Teresa is a waitress though she's now known as Juanita. In a tango bar in Stanley or in Puerto Margarita. She's the sweetest and the sauciest. The loveliest and the naughtiest. She's Miss Buenos Aires in a world of lacy lingerie. Chorus. Japanese got Jesus robots telling teenage fortunes. For all we know and all we care they might as well be Martians. They say gold paint on the palace gates comes from the teeth of pensioners. They're so tired of shooting protest singers. That they hardly mention us. While fountains fill with second-hand perfume. And sodden trading stamps. They'll hang the bullies and the louts that dampen down the day. Chorus. We braved the cold November air and the undertaker's curses. Saying ""Take me to the Folies Bergere and please don't spare the hearses"". For he always had a dream of that revolver in your purse. How you loved him 'til you hated him and made him cry for mercy. He said ""Don't ever mention my name there or talk of all the nights you cried. We've always been like worlds apart now you're seeing two nightmares collide""."
toledo,"All through the night you telephoned. I saw the light blinking red. Beside the cradle. But you don't know how far I've gone. Now I must live with the lie. That I made. But if I call, I know I won't have to say it. You'll hear my voice - something is bound to betray it. But do people living in Toledo. Know that their name hasn't travelled very well?. And does anybody in Ohio. Dream of that Spanish citadel?. But it's no use saying that I love you. And how that girl really didn't mean a thing to me. For if anyone should look into your eyes. It's not forgiveness that they're gonna see. You hear her voice - ""How could you do that?"". You hear her voice - ""How could you do that?"". So I walked outside in the bright. Sunshine and lovers pass by. Smiling and joking. But they don't know the fool I was. Why should they care what was lost. What was broken?. But if I call, I know I won't have to say it. You'll hear my voice - something is bound to betray it. But do people living in Toledo. Know that their name hasn't travelled very well?. And does anybody in Ohio. Dream of that Spanish citadel?. But it's no use saying that I love you. And how that girl really didn't mean a thing to me. For if anyone should look into your eyes. It's not forgiveness that they're gonna see. But do people living in Toledo. Know that their name hasn't travelled very well?. And does anybody in Ohio. Dream of that Spanish citadel?. But we still have Florence, Alabama. We don't have Paris, and we don't have Rome."
tommy's coming home,(McCartney/MacManus). She was counting out the window of the outbound train. All the poles of the telegraph. And the rock-a-bye rhythm in the song of the rails. Couldn't make the sweet bird laugh. Down down down so deep. Down down drowning in his sleep. Tommy's coming home again. And a hawk hovered high above a skinny jackrabbit. Pursued by a hungry fox. And a broker awoke her from a fitful slumber. Then consulted his shares and his stocks. Down down down they go. Down down how he'll never know. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. As he glanced on his paper looking through the veil (?). He could see she was really upset. As she tucked back the ribbon in a velvet box. As he offered her a cigarette. Down down down she took a drag. Now he's covered in a flag. Tommy's coming home again. And it's almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. But how could he know that only twelve months later. She would wear her skirt up over her knee. And in the very same carriage she'd be flattened with roses. And forget the tears of bigotry (?). Down down down they flow. Now now now it just don't matter anymore. Tommy made it home again. When it was almost April Fools' Day. Almost April Fools' Day. And the joke's on everyone. He had that premonition. Only dead men dwell upon. Tommy's coming home again. Tommy's coming home again.
tonight the bottle let me down,Tonight the bottle let me down. It let your memory come around. The one true friend I thought I'd found. Tonight the bottle let me down. I've always had a bottle I could turn to. And lately I've been turnin' every day. But the wine don't take effect the way it used to. And I'm hurtin' in old familiar ways. Tonight the bottle let me down. It let your memory come around. The one true friend I thought I'd found. Tonight the bottle let me down. Each night I leave the bar room when it's over. Not feeling any pain at closing time. But tonight your memory found me much too sober. I can't drink enough to keep you off my mind. Tonight the bottle let me down. It let your memory come around. The one true friend I thought I'd found. Tonight the bottle let me down.
too blue,"There may be a break in the road. The future looks drab and dreary. But if you were here with me, dear. I'd spin you a line that's far from cheer. There's always some scribe. Who's taken the bribe. Describing some Gentleman Jim. Who says he's in love with a beautiful girl. But she don't care about him. Say what you do. That sky is much to blue. You'll know sorrow. That's deeper than the ocean. It's a pitiful chain of events. You'd think that I might have more sense. He says. ""The birds in the braches may whistle and croon. ""But they're singing out of tune"". There may be bend in the track. But if you come back to see me. I'll be waiting patiently here. And if you believe that then I fear. There's always some clown. Who's bringing me down. By humming a tragic refrain. He says he's in love with a beautiful girl."
too far gone,I can tell somewhere there's someone you love more than me. Someone you love more than me. And it hurts to say it that you have a right to be free. I know that's the way it should be. Oh but I'm too far gone. Too far gone. I know I've loved you too much for too long. And I'm too far gone. If ever your new love should hurt you or make you feel blue. Hurt you or make you feel blue. Just remember your old love will still be around loving you. I'll be around loving you. Oh 'cause I'm too far gone. Too far gone. I know I've loved you too much for too long. And I'm too far gone.
town cryer,I'm the town crier. And everybody knows. I'm a little down. With a lifetime to go. Maybe you don't believe my heart is in the right place. Why don't you take a good look at my face. Other boys use the splendour of their trembling lip. They're so teddy bear tender and tragically hip. I'm never going to cry again. I'm going to be as strong as them. They say they'd die for love. And then they live it out. They'll give you something to cry about. And suddenly you really fall to pieces. I'm the town crier. And everybody knows. I'm a little down. With a lifetime to go. Maybe you don't believe my heart is in the right place. Why don't you take a good look at my face. Other boys use the splendour of their trembling lip. They're so teddy bear tender and tragically hip. Love and unhappiness go arm in arm. Long suffering friends of your fatal charm. Isn't it a pity that you're going to get hurt. Just a little boy lost in a big man's shirt. .
town where time stood still,"I made my selection from the lonely hit parade. In the town where time stood still. I was feeling very little pain. Until some joker played ""Almost Persuaded"". Now every girl I see. Looks so much prettier to me. My faithfulness has faded. And their looks established daggers. And the conversation heated. Since the boys had all been late. I found them walking round defeated. In the town where time stood still. Somebody in charge must have pretended. The future's been suspended. And I say I don't want trouble. But I find myself back in it. In the town where time stood still. I am the man of the minute. Teach me to say ""I love you"". I'll teach you to say ""You will do"". In the town where time stood still. A way that I can find a little girl. To wind me up with all the usual spells. There's nothing else to do but rearrange somebody's future. And check your figures in the till. The bar is full of girls just like the creature with the curse. And the food is just like cabaret and vice versa. In the town where time stood still. Just as my heart went down sinking. I found the town was shrinking. And suddenly I saw her through the smoke and empty beers. In the town where time stood still. She might have well have waited years. Now I suppose we did some things we used to do. But no amount of darkness could ever turn her into you. And so I woke up in the town where time stood still. With a headache and a heartache. And a handful of pills. A welcome mat, a scandal rag and unpaid bills. With her hand inside her handbag. The sign says ""please wait to be seated"". I only want a cup of coffee. I know you can't have your cake and eat it. In the town where time stood still. Did you hear the news today?. It's all bad; they'll be howling after sunset. With a headache and a heartache. And an hour or two to kill. I only wish we were together."
tramp the dirt down,"I saw a newspaper picture from the political campaign. A woman was kissing a child, who was obviously in pain. She spills with compassion, as that young child's. face in her hands she grips. Can you imagine all that greed and avarice. coming down on that child's lips. Well I hope I don't die too soon. I pray the Lord my soul to save. Oh I'll be a good boy, I'm trying so hard to behave. Because there's one thing I know, I'd like to live. long enough to savour. That's when they finally put you in the ground. I'll stand on your grave and tramp the dirt down. When England was the whore of the world. Margaret was her madam. And the future looked as bright and as clear as. the black tarmacadam. Well I hope that she sleeps well at night, isn't. haunted by every tiny detail. 'Cos when she held that lovely face in her hands. all she thought of was betrayal. And now the cynical ones say that it all ends the same in the long run. Try telling that to the desperate father. who just squeezed the life from his only son. And how it's only voices in your head and dreams you never dreamt. Try telling him the subtle difference between justice and contempt. Try telling me she isn't angry with this pitiful discontent. When they flaunt it in your face as you line up for punishment. And then expect you to say ""Thank you"" straighten up,. look proud and pleased. Because you've only got the symptoms,. you haven't got the whole disease. Just like a schoolboy, whose head's like a tin-can. filled up with dreams then poured down the drain. Try telling that to the boys on both sides,. being blown to bits or beaten and maimed. Who takes all the glory and none of the shame. Well I hope you live long now, I pray the Lord your soul to keep. I think I'll be going before we fold our arms and start to weep. I never thought for a moment that human life could be so cheap. 'Cos when they finally put you in the ground. They'll stand there laughing. And tramp the dirt down"
tripwire,"Just because you don't speak the language. Doesn't mean that you can't understand. Just because you don't speak the language. Doesn't mean that you can't understand.

And all of your fine clothes worn into rags. Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire. There's a tripwire. Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire. Don't open the door 'cos they're coming. Don't open the door 'cos they're here. Above there's an ominous humming. Below there's a murmur of prayer. Torn from the pages of scandal. Sprayed on a wall in the frays of the flag.

Thrown in the air like confetti in church. Far, far away there's a target. and the sound of an army just starting to march. Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire. There's a tripwire. Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire. Just because I don't read the language. Doesn't mean that I'm blind to the threat. Though I thought there was more to forgiveness. Than all we conveniently forget.

turning the town red,"You've been taught that this won't do. They put me in the picture but the film turned blue. A glimpse of you, Turning The Town Red.. A head full of brand new words and a mouth full of shocks. You're a big boy now, with a face to stop clocks.. Turning the Town Red. (x2). You made your bed, and now you better dream in it.. The word that you once whispered, now you're screamin' it.. Days drip down like bad wallpaper.. Pictures plastered on the ivy creeper between your old toy soldiers. and your mother's sleepers.. Turning the Town Red. (x2). You made your bed, you better face the consequence.. A black pool opened at my feet into a dream sequence.. Turning the Town Red. Aah. (x4). You know I heard her call my name. Least, I think that's what she said.. Surely I'm the correlation that's gonna cause her shame. So, what's she doing in my bed?. Turning the Town Red. Aah.."
twenty-five fingers,(McCartney-MacManus). Twenty five fingers baby. I love your nails I love your touch. I love to touch you baby. It never fails to kill me. Some say gimme five. But I'll give you ten. You could make it twenty. But you're holding out again. Think it over think it over baby. Well think it over think it over baby. I will always love you. That can't be denied. Love you up until the day. That heaven knows I've tried. For the time being I will tell you this. I'd love to love you love to love you. But there's something missing. Baby listen unconditionally. Put your hand in my hand and surrender to me. Think it over think it over baby. Well think it over think it over baby. Twenty five fingers feel so divine. Twenty five fingers wish you were mine. Wish you were mine. Well so our hands met and twenty fingers entwined. I couldn't help I couldn't help but see. She didn't quite believe me. She said listen cause there's one little thing. Where did you get that lovely wedding ring. Think it over think it over baby. Well think it over think it over baby. Some things are forbidden. Never meant to be. Well that might be all right for you. But not for you and me. Twenty five fingers feel so divine. Twenty five fingers wish you were mine. Wish you were mine.
twenty-five to twelve,"You say you don't desire me. You only tire me. Now you'll hire me. Expensive care is meaningless. Feeling nothing and caring less. Cut off at the pass. She knows where you're headed. She wants double time. Or a temporary wedding. Chorus:. And the lucky girl leads a life of leisure. With 45 years for seconds of pleasure. The hands on the clock move so precisely. And I only kiss but once or twice. I can't help you now,. I can't help myself. 'Cause the time's running out. And it's twenty-five to twelve. Crowds surround loudspeakers. On the lampposts. Listening to the murder mystery. Meanwhile someone's in the classroom. Busy forging books on history. Wouldn't give that man my hand. He'd steal my fingers. So the sleuth ends up in stitches. And your urges turn to itches. Chorus. I was committed to life. And then commuted to the outskirts. I was living for thirty minutes at a time. With a break in the middle for adverts. See the human furniture. But its only for show. Now you can look all that you like. But they only let you touch and go."
two little hitlers,"Why are we racing to be so old?. I'm up late pacing the floor. I won't be told. You have your reservations. I'm bought and sold. I'll face the music. I'll face the facts. Even when we walk in polka dots and chequer slacks. Bowing and squawking. Running after titbits. Bobbing and squinting. Just like a nitwit. Two little Hitlers will fight it out until. One little Hitler does the other one's will. I will return. I will not burn. Down in the basement. I need my head examined. I need my eyes excited. I'd like to join the party. But I was not invited. You make a member of me. I'll be delighted. I wouldn't cry for lost souls, you might drown. Dirty words for dirty minds. Written in a toilet town. Dial me a Valentine. She's a smooth operator. It's all so calculated. She's got a calculator. She's my soft touch typewriter. And I'm the great dictator. (Chorus). A simple game of self-respect. You flick a switch and the world goes off. Nobody jumps as you expect. I would have thought you would have had enough by now. You call selective dating. For some effective mating. I thought I'd let you down, dear. But you were just deflating. I knew right from the start. We'd end up hating. Pictures of the merchandise. Plastered on the wall. We can look so long as we don't have to talk at all. You say you'll never know him. He's an unnatural man. He doesn't want your pleasure. He wants as no one can. He wants to know the names of. All those he's better than. (Chorus). I will return. I will not burn. (repeats)"
uncomplicated,Blood and Chocolate. I hope you're satisfied what you have done. You think it's over now. But we've only just begun. I asked for water. And they gave me rose' wine. A horse that knows arithmetic. And a dog that tells your fortune. Chorus: It's in your eyes. Uncomplicated. I want to buy you. A big blue Diamel. Cheap white plastic shoes. That don't walk out and don't let in. I want to show you. How I love you. When you're over me. There's no-one above you. Chorus. You think it's over now. But this is only the beginning. Chorus. .
under lime,"It's a long way down from the high. horse you're on. When you stumble and then you're thrown. The last time we say him he was. out in the rain. Watchin' that train roll down the track. Now he's back in showbiz. Peddlin' his comeback. . We know that he's desperate. and we know that he's broke. He's the mystery guest we'll puncture. They told a young girl with. a clipboard ""Just keep him amused"". Whatever you do, don't tell him your name. Whatever you say, don't let him drink. Under lime, under lime, under lime. . He whistles out of tune. His words don't always rhyme. ""But we will be right back. ""We're almost out of time"". Down a long corridor he's trying to impress. He was helpin' a showgirl fasten up her dress. . And the clock on the wall tick-tocked. the time away. And the band starts to play. . In the violent strip of an undressing room. She loosened his grip and started. Tell me your story, if you feel so inclined. He was a mess, almost resigned. Though she could guess, I think you will find. She thought, ""Oh you know, I wouldn't mind"". He asked he boyfriend's name. Then her whole family tree. She thought ""I can't believe it's. happening to me"". And upset, said ""Hey pet. ""Would you kindly pass that pill. And allow me to just dictate my dying will. And the clock on the wall tick-tocked. the time away. And the band starts to play. Jimmy was dreamin' as she uncrossed he legs. He shuttered his eyes discreetly. And he thought of a drummer. and considered a snare. But the beat of his heart. Said, ""Don't even start"". His conscience was bare. Said, ""Hey, don't even dare"". She's completely unaware. She forced a laugh or a sigh. At every alibi. Once every crime was confessed. He buttoned up his vest. Said ""Hey gal, you'r a pal. ""You've really been a sport. And you don't get a record. If you never get caught. And the clock on the wall. tick-tocked the time away. And the band starts to play. It's a long way down from the high horse. you're on. It's a long way back as you cover your track. Or you bury your crime. Under lime, under lime, under lime. under lime. It's a long way down from the high. horse you're on. It's a long way back as you cover your track. Or you bury your crime. Under lime, under lime, under lime. under lime. It's a long way down from the high. horse you're on. It's a long way back as you cover your track. As you bury your crime. Under lime, under lime, under lime. under lime"
unwanted number,"You should hear the things that they say about me. They're saying ""She's no better than she needed to be"". They don't know that he was kind and strong and tender. And now I'll never be another Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number. How can I tell them?. How can I express?. How it felt to step out of this life and into his embrace. How can I tell them?. How can I explain?. All the love that I never had I found in him. There may be a stain on the family name. And if my father was here I think I know who he'd blame. Mama says that he just doesn't care to remember. And all he thinks of me is another Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number. (How can I tell her?. How can I express?. How it felt when he came to my room. And helped me to undress. What can she tell me?. How can I believe. That she really didn't hear me cry. When he wouldn't leave?). There's a local game where they whisper my shame. They say ""; He gave her his child. He wouldn't give her his name"". They will torture me from January till September. And soon there's going to be another Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number. Unwanted number. And I will give my love to another Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number. Unwanted Number"
upon a veil of midnight blue,Upon a veil of midnight blue. There hung a crescent moon. To light the view. But I don't whisper the words. When the moment arose. I wonder how he knows. You say your tongue is tied. Your words escape and hide. But he's so patient and kind. He's prepared to read your mind. That's very well till you find. Because of the wine you drank. Your mind is still a blank. I wonder how he knows. I guess I will wonder until. I pluck up the courage to tell him. How I feel. So close I can feel his heart tremble. That look in his eyes as they close. I wonder how he knows. I wonder how he knows.
veronica,"Is it all in that pretty little head of yours?. What goes on in that place in the dark?. Well I used to know a girl. And I could have sworn that. Her name was Veronica. Well she used to have. A carefree mind of her own and. A delicate look in her eye. These days I'm afraid. She's not even sure. If her name is Veronica. CHORUS:. Do you suppose,. That waiting hands on eyes,. Veronica has gone to hide?. And all the time she laughs. At those who shout. Her name and steal her clothes. Veronica. Veronica. Did the days drag by?. Did the favours wane?. Did he roam down the town. All the time?. Will you wake from your dream,. With a wolf at the door,. Reaching out for Veronica. Well it was all of sixty-five years ago. When the world was the street. Where she lived. And a young man sailed on. A ship in the sea. With a picture of Veronica. On the ""Empress of India"". And as she closed her eyes. Upon the world and. Picked upon the bones. Of last week's news. She spoke his name out loud again. Repeat chorus. Veronica sits in her favourite chair and. She sits very quiet and still. And they call her a name. That they never get right and. If they don't then nobody else will. But she used to have. A carefree mind of her own,. With devilish look in her eye. Saying ""You can call me. Anything you like,. But my name is Veronica"". Repeat chorus."
viceroy's row,"Now there's a crank in every crowd. Sprinkling gunpowder. Seems that everything is about to blow. They lit the burning paper. With a waxen taper. Sitting up here on Viceroy's Row. And they're gathering flowers. In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go. Watching the pipeline as it overflowed. Sitting pretty here on Viceroy's Row. He made a fortune out of barbed wire. In the last days of the Empire. Built a cast-iron curtain. Just to keep control. He was a tycoon, then a cheapskate. Went out looking for a keepsake. To tuck into his suitcase on Viceroy's Row. And they're gathering flowers. In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go. Watching the pipeline as it overflowed. Sitting pretty here on Viceroy's Row. He had a satchel full of cash. And dishes full of ashes. He went from boom to bust. In the blinking of a lash. Heard the rat-a-tat of the late patrol. Shooting out the lights up on Viceroy's Row. And they're gathering flowers. In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go. They're coming for him slowly. Now the war is over. Sitting up here on Viceroy's Row. The woman in a blindfold. She doesn't want her hand held. Walking through a minefield. Saying ""How does this feel? "". Stepping on the quicksand. Going down slow. Hiding up here on Viceroy's Row. Nothing satisfies. The ruins of his blue eyes. Like blood stains on a diamond mine. And deep within you felt. Not one measure of his guilt. Staring in the dark up on Viceroy's Row. Yet her penitent lover. Took a ribbon of rubber. Tied her to the bed made of silken thread. But without an ounce of mercy. They denounced him with a curse. Hammering on the door upon Viceroy's Row. Now his little concubine in her cemetery drag. Her face all smeared with charcoal. Is leaving all her cares, so. Take 500 acres and see what you can sow. We came to overthrow those on Viceroy's Row. They're gathering flowers. In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go. Watching the pipeline as it overflowed. Sitting up here on Viceroy's Row"
waiting for the end of the world,"The man from the television crawled into the train.. I wonder who he's gonna stick it in this time.. Everyone was looking for a little entertainment,. so they'll probably pull his hands off. when they find out his name.. And then they shut down the power all along the line,. and we got stuck in the tunnel where no lights shine.. They got to touching all the girls were to scared to call out.. Nobody was saying anything at all.. We were waiting for the end of the world,. waiting for the end of the world,. waiting for the end of the world.. Dear Lord I sincerely hope you're coming. 'cause you really started something.. Things got back to normal as the train began to roll again.. We got to the station about twenty minutes later.. The legendary hitchhiker says that he knows where it's at.. Now he'd like to go to Spain or somewhere like that,. with his two-tone Bible and his funny cigarettes,. his suntan lotion and his castanets.. He was waiting for the end of the world,. waiting for the end of the world,. waiting for the end of the world.. Dear Lord I sincerely hope you're coming. 'cause you really started something.. And then the bride, the groom, the congregation and the priest. all got onto the train when we were three stations east, yeah.. Hiding from a scandal in the national press,. they had been trying to get married since they stole the wedding dress.. You may see them drowning as you stroll along the beach,. but don't throw out the lifeline till they're clean out of reach.."
wake me up,"I've got this phosphorescent portrait. Of gentle jesus meek and mild. I've got this harlot that I'm stuck. With carrying another man's child. The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived. They'd throw us back across the border. If they knew that we survived. And they were surprised to see us. So they greeted us with palms. They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition. And small alms. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up. Wake me up, wake me up. With a slap or a kiss. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up. Wake me up, wake me up. There must be something better than this. I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial. I've got the ac. trained on the t. v. So it won't blow up in my eye. And everything that I thought fanciful or mocked. As too extreme. Must be family entertainment. Here in the strange land of my dreams. And I'm practising my likeness of st. francis of assisi. And if I hold my hand outstretched. A little bird comes to me. And I might recite a small prayer. If I ever said them. I lay down on an iron frame. And found myself in bedlam. Stepping on the fingers. That were stretching through the bars. Wailing echoes down the corridors. Wake me up, wake me up. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up. With a slap or a kiss. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up. Wake me up, wake me up. There must be something better than this. They've got this scared and decorated girl. Strapped to the steel trunk of a mustang. They drove her down a cypress grove. Where traitors hang and stars still spangle. They dangled flags and other rags. Along a coloured thread of twine. They dragged that bruised and purple heart. Along the road to palestine. Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces. Easter saw a slaughtering. Each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces. My thoughts returned to vengeance. But I put up no resistance. Though I seemed a long way from my home. It really was no distance. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up. Wake me up, wake me up. With a slap or a kiss. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up. Wake me up, wake me up. There must be something better than this. And the player piano picks out ""life goes on"". The ringtone rang out ""jerusalem"". Into the pit of sadness. Where the wretched plunge. We've buried all the innocents. We must bury revenge. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up. Wake me up, wake me up. There must be something better than this. There must be something better than this. There must be something better than this. In the name of the father and the son. In the name of gasoline and a gun. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up. Wake me up, wake me up"
walk us uptown,Will you walk us uptown?. And wherever you go. You know we will follow. Will you walk us uptown?. And we'll stand in the light. Of your new killing ground. And we won't make a sound. Except to sing our sorrow. Will you walk us uptown?. While our tears run in torrents. To suffer in silence or pray for some solace. Will you wash away our sins. In the cross-fire and cross-currents. As you uncross your fingers. And take out some insurance. No matter what the price. It's your own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. Some hearts are sinking. And some hearts are a-flutter. Some scoop gold from the dirt in the gutter. Or swallow the earth. Pouring into your mouth. As they bury us upright saying. 'Everything's alright'. Will you walk us uptown?. Like some said that you could. We will feast on your flesh. And drink down your blood. Will you haul down that flag. And dishonour that vow. Cause we must not change. It's color now. Will you walk us uptown?. No matter what the price. Each crushed in the corner of their own paradise. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you walk us uptown?. That's always assuming. That you're partly divine and partly human. You're the king of our hearts. You're the clown with the drum. Will you walk us uptown?. If we promise not to run. Will you walk us uptown?. Will you gather us near. As cowards flee and traitors sneer. Keep a red flag flying. Keep a blue flag as well. And a white flag in case it all goes to hell
walking on thin ice,"Walking on thin ice, I'm paying the price.. I'm throwing the dice in the air.. Why must we learn it the hard way. And play the game of life with our hearts?. I gave you my life, you gave me your life.. Like a gush of wind in my hair.. Why do we forget what's been said. And play the game of life with our hearts?. I may cry someday. A kiss will dry whichever way.. And when my heart returns to ashes, it will be just a story.. It will be just a story.. And you go and try to walk across the lake. Crossed it with winter and all of this is ice. A terrible thing to do. They say the lake is as thick as the ocean.. I wonder if she knew?."
watch your step,Don't say a word. Don't say anything. Don't say a word. I'm not even listening. I read in the paper about their escape. They're just two BITTER kids WITH a bunch of sour grapes. You better watch your step. Watch who's knocking on your front door. Now you know that they're watching. What are you waiting for?. Think you're young and original. Get out before.... They get to watch your step. Ev'ry day is full of fun. And family spies. They're making heroes out of fall guys. They say it's good for business. From Singapore to Widnes. You better watch your step. Broken noses hung up on the wall. Back slapping drinkers cheer the heavy weight brawl. So punch drunk they don't understand at all. You better watch your step. Ev'ry night. Go out full of carnival desires. End up in the closing time choirs. When you're kicking in the courtroom. And you're drinking down the Eau de Cologne. And you're spitting out the Kodachrome. You better watch your step. Bye. I send you all my regards. You're so tough. You're so hard. Listen to the hammers falling in the breaker's yard. You better watch your step. You better watch your step.

wave a white flag,"Take off your shoes, hang up your wings. Stack up the chairs, roll up the rug. Savor the things that sobriety brings. Drain in the last from a jug. But when I hit the bottle, there's no tellin' what I'll do. 'Cause something deep inside me wants to turn you black and blue. I can't resist you, I can't wait. To twist your loving arms 'til you capitulate. Beat me in the kitchen, and I'll beat you in the hall. There's nothing I love better than a free for all. To take your pretty neck and see which way it bends. But when it is all over we will still be friends. Wave a white flag, put away the pistol. Too many people just can't get kissed. But if there's nothin' I can do to make amends, baby. Hope you don't murder me. Oh, was it all right, or was it okay. I'll make it all up to you someday. Oh, but you didn't have to laugh that way. Oh, no, you didn't have to laugh that way. Wave a white flag, put away the pistol. Too many people just can't get kissed. But if there's nothin' I can do to make amends, baby.

wednesday week,"The movies save on conversation. And the TV saves on sight. We met in a head-on collision. So I would say our chances would be slight. You can lead and I will follow. See us dancing cheek to cheek. You'll remember me tomorrow. But you won't give a damn by Wednesday Week. Say you love me until you do so. Joso singing just like Caruso. Three little words roll off your tongue. Somehow your face just doesn't look so young. You say you want to strike a bargain. Now there is no need to speak. You say you want to learn the jargon. But you won't give a damn by Wednesday Week. You start acting like a zombie. Someone wants your piece of cake. You think you want to jump up on me. But you won't give a damn by Wednesday Week. Oh what a letdown when the battle was finally won. One little breakdown and then it was over and done. I wish I had your confidence. It's love and not coincidence. Do you say these words to everyone ?. You're fantastic, you're terrific. Your excellence is almost scientific. You took the words out of my mouth. You put the tongue into my cheek. But I'd better lose my memory by Wednesday Week."

With the fear that I'll live it all again. In my dreams. You're there to haunt me. When you say she doesn't want me. I've been hurt. Do you know what that means?. Weird nightmare.

what do i do now?,"(Wener). Quickly she came dressed up for fame. Riding her perfume downstairs. Make-up like glue, she danced round the room. To the sound of her corduroy flares. Let's go to town, taxis all round. We could stop for a couple of beers. He looks at it all stifles a yawn. She tries not to look like she cares. Chorus:. What do I do now? Are we going under?. What did I do wrong?. I thought we had it sorted out the other day. Maybe I'm just stupid. Can't we try again?. No one told me it was raining (raining, raining). Can't face a club, they walk to a nearby pub. Watch a couple of bands. Draining the glass they walk home at last. Reaching for each others hands. Nothing is said he goes to bed. Dreaming of her on his own. She stays up all week, watching him sleep. Scared that she'll wake up alone. Chorus. Oh I'll miss you every day of your life. Oh you'll feel it too, you're not that strong. You know I'm on to you. Oh I'll miss you every day of your life. Maybe when you're dead. I'll get some rest from holding onto you (holding onto you). What do I do now? Are we going under?. What did I do wrong?. Thought we had it sorted. Is there someone else? Am I too familiar?. Was it when I said I wanted to have children?. Tore up all your photos, didn't feel too clever. Spent the whole of Sunday sticking you together. Now I'd like to call but I feel too awkward. Some things need explaining. No one told me it was raining (raining, raining...)."
what's her name today?,"What's her name today?. What's her name today?. She could be anyone. I might have known you'd leave her crying. What's her name again?. You should be ashamed. How could you treat her so unspeakably?. Or did you think she was a different girl?. For as the radio played in the bedroom wall. What was that name you called her?. Was she the one who took away your pride. And your reason?. Oh, why did you decide that. You'd punish any girl you meet. To try and make that feeling go away?. What's her name today?. What's her name today?. Is her hair hanging down?. Or maybe it's fixed with a ribbon. Are her eyes still blue?. Should she trust in you?. Because it's a lonely world. She wants to believe for a while in all the things you say. But as the radio played in the bedroom wall. What was that name you called her?. Isn't her smile reminiscent of someone else?. Well, is it or isn't it?. Oh, why did you decide that. You'd punish any girl you meet. To try and make that feeling go away?. What's her name today?. Is she going to stay. So you can ruin her?. And soon she'll be twisted in chiffon. Dress her like a doll. String her like a pearl. She hears peals of bells, but it's hard to tell. Now that she's hung up like a chandelier. What's her name?. What's her name?. What's her name today?."
when did i stop dreaming?,"You appeared when I was lost in reverie. If this is not a dream, it's my mistake. And now I lie in wait for dawn to break. I'm fairly sure I'm wide awake. Pardon me, if I seem distant and strange. Just tell me when did I stop dreaming?. Let me get this straight. Did I hallucinate?. This fine and helpless feeling. Tell me when did I stop dreaming?. Let me know if you can help me explain. I didn't recognise the danger. But people will talk. Was I just sleepwalking?. Footprints left on the ceiling. Tell me when did I stop dreaming?. Then why should you care?. This is my nightmare. Was this one dream too deep?. Now if I could only sleep. Answer me, if you see the end in sight. I'm just a soul who's lost in limbo. Neither bad or good. I'd spare you now if I could. One more teardrop. Then I'll wake up."
when green eyes turn blue,"Every single time. It becomes too much. There's nothing I can say. Or I can touch. But the glory is, as it comes passing through,. I know I will be there. When green eyes turn blue. It's the same for me. Time appears to teach. There is nothing quite beyond our reach. Wits may sharpen up. Their cuts and clever flays. Let them squander all of them. You brighten up my darkest gaze. And as a consequence I can see out of the gloom. That I gathered about myself. That I thought would flatter me. What the hell was the matter with me. Every single time I approached despair. I thought of your name and you were there. I won't burden you. As promises will do. But I know I will be there."
when i was cruel no. 2,"I exit through the spotlight glare. I stepped out into thin air. Into a perfume so rarefied. ""Here comes the bride"". Not quite aside, they snide, ""She's number four"". ""There's number three just by the door"". Those in the know, don't even flatter her,. they go one better. ""She was selling speedboats in a tradeshow when he met her"". Look at her now. She's starting to yawn. She looks like she was born to it. But it was so much easier. When I was cruel. She reaches out her arms to me. Imploring: ""Another melody?"". So she can dance her husband out on the floor. The captains of industry just lie there where they fall. In eau-de-nil and pale carnation creation. A satin sash and velvet elevation. She straightens the tipsy head-dress of her spouse. While hers recalls a honey house. There'll be no sorrows left to drown. Early in the morning in your evening gown. But it was so much easier. When I was cruel. The entrance hall was arranged with hostesses and ushers. Who turned out to be the younger wives nursing schoolgirl crushes. Parting the waves of those few feint friends. Fingers once offered are now too heavy to extend. The ghostly first wife glides up on stage whispering to raucous talkers. Spilling family secrets out to flunkeys and castrato walkers. See that girl,. Watch that scene. Digging the ""Dancing Queen"". Two newspaper editors like playground sneaks. Running a book on which of them is going to last the week. One of them calls to me. And he says, ""I know you"". ""You gave me this tattoo back in '82"". ""You were a spoilt child then with a record to plug"". ""And I was a shaven headed seaside thug"". ""Things haven't really changed that much"". ""One of us is still getting paid too much"". There are some things I can't report. The memory of his last retort. But it was so much easier. When I was cruel. Look at me now. She's starting to yawn. She looks like she was born to it. Ah, but it was so much easier."
when it sings,All the words you say to me. Have music in them. All the sorrows and the joys like magnetism. And a selfish boy looks through a prism. And says what is. But never asks what isn't. But a voice contains many precious things. It laughs. And then it sings. And all the lies that we can tell. To our foolish selves. Maybe this is the love song that I refused to. Write her when I loved her like I used to. And I fear my heart may spin and fracture. Like tears of stone falling from a statue. But a voice contains all that's true and false. Then cries for someone else. And for some honest tenderness. So I must confess. All the words you say to me. Have music in them. All the sorrows and the joys like magnetism. And a selfish boy looks through a prism. And says what is.
when that i was and a little tiny boy,When that I was and a little tiny boy. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. A foolish thing was but a toy. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came to man's estate. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came alas to wife. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. By swaggering I could never fright. For the rain it raineth. Every day. But when I came unto my bed. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. With tosspots still a drunken head. For the rain it raineth. Every day. A great while ago the world began. With a Hey-ho. The wind and the rain. But that's all one our play is done. And we'll strive to please you. Every day.
white knuckles,"White knuckles came down to put the frighteners on. I believe she's the one that he's got his heart set on. It doesn't matter if your face doesn't fit. There's no charge for changing it. Oooh ooh. What are you doing. You see right through him. You don't have to take it when he gets cruel. Chorus:. White knuckles on black and blue skin. (1,4) You don't have to take it so you just give in. (2,3) He didn't mean to hit her but she kept laughing. White knuckles sweatin' on the headboard. He never found out what the kisser was for. Losing face with the boys while she's whispering in his ear. They never found out why they called it laughing gear. Maybe they weren't loved when they were young. Maybe they should be hung by their tongues. Oooh ooh. Under the blankets with the body jerk. He needs her like the axe needs the turkey. Making a mockery of his fancy footwork. Chorus. There's always someone new to toy with when the penny drops in the slot. Now it's all petty crime on the news at nine. But it's all she's got. Love on the never never dreams don't come cheap. I don't close my eyes when I go to sleep. Oooh ooh. It gets right under your skin. It makes you as miserable as sin but. you don't have to take it so you just give in. Chorus. Why don't you come round anymore. Mama said. He's using you. Sister said. I told you so too. When he goes through your head. You took him to be true."
who do you think you are?,"The hunted look, the haunted grace. The empty laugh that you cultivate. You fall into that false embrace. And kiss the air about her face. Who do you think you are?. The tres bon mots you almost quote from your. QUIVER of literary darts. A thousand or so tuneless violins thrilling your cheap. little heart. Who do you think you are?. My cigarette burns right down to the ash, my coffee. cup is unstained. The waiter hovers close at hand. His courtesy strained. Who do you think you are?. I close with my regards. Well I'm the red-face gentleman. Caught in this picture postcard. Who do you think you are?. Trying my best to make the best of your absence. Though the joke gets tired and sordid. Sea-shell hearts get trampled under foot. Punchlines unrewarded. But even at this distance it's not easy to accept. The vision that I chase returns when I least expect it. I've fallen from your tired embrace."
why can't a man stand alone?,"Why can't a man stand alone?. Must he be burdened by all that he's taught to consider his own?. His skin and his station, his kin and his crown, his flag and his nation. They just weigh him down. You know pride is a sin that we tend to forgive. But it gets hard to live. When you don't have the love in her heart to begin with. Why can't a man stand alone?. Why can't a woman be just what she seems?. Must she be tarnished by men who can only be men in their dreams?. When beauty meets ignorance they shout in the street. Repeating their offer to each girl they meet. The respect that she needs, it isn't a gift. But it gets hard to lift yourself up. When you don't have the strength to begin with. Why can't a woman stand alone?. Why can't a baby sleep at night and dream of the time to come. And never fear the world outside the touch of someone very near. Why can't a man stand up?. Why can't a man stand up?."
why don't you love me (like you used to do),"Why don't you love me like you used to do?. How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?. My hair is still curly and my eyes are still blue. Why don't you love me like you used to do?. Ain't had no lovin' like a-huggin' and a-kissin' in a long, long while. We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile. Why don't you be the sort you used to be?. How come you find so many faults with me?. I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through. Why don't you love me like you used to do?. Ain't had no lovin' like a-huggin' and a-kissin' in a long, long while. We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile. Why don't you spark me like you used to do?. Say sweet nothings like you used to coo. Somebody's changed, so let me give you a clue."

why?,Why is Daddy not here?. Are you crying?. Why?. Does he still love me?. Will you take care of me?. If you both love me so. Why don't you love each other. Mummy's gone missing. Daddy's on fire. Daddy's on fire.

withered and died,"This cruel old country has driven me down, teased me and lied.. I've only sad stories to tell to this town. My dreams have withered and died.. Once I was bending the tops of the trees,. Kind thoughts in my head, kind voices to hear.. Then I took up with a girl from the West.. They'd run and hide, they'd run and hide.. Count one to ten and she's gone like the rest.. My dreams have withered and died.. If I was a butterfly, lived for a day,. I could be free just blowing away.. Silver moon sailor and silver moonshine. On the water so wide, water so wide,. Slip from the bed of a good friend of mine. My dreams have withered and died.. Once I was bending the tops of the trees. Kind thoughts in my head, kind voices to hear.. This cruel country has driven me down, teased me and lied.. Teased me and lied.. I've only sad stories to tell to this town.. My dreams have withered and died. (x3)."
worthless thing,"How many times can you jump out of the cupboard. Before someone gets suspicious or someone gets discovered. You can live forever in a split second of fame. Come on down the price is right what's your name. While a crocodile makes good shoes and a dog may change his coat. I can't change what's written on your face tonight and I quote. Chorus. Oh I wish you could see. Quite how much you could mean to me. You worthless thing. If you were ten feet taller and almost handsome. I might pay this king's ransom. You worthless thing. They commit blue murder along Union Avenue. Then they sell you souvenir matches. Nightclubs full of grave robbers from Memphis, Tennessee. And Las Vegas body snatchers. And he's carrying a warning can't you see how his eyes glint. Keep your bloody hands off my life your affectionate fingerprint. Chorus. All the cars and pills and girls who tore his shirt to tatters. Do you know how tall he was 'cos that is all that really matters?. Do you know his mother's last name do you think that he's divine?. You've seen the film you've read the book. you're drinking vintage Elvis Presley wine. Bored out of your tiny mind while life is twice as large. They'll cut her down to size on television. She's available and beautiful, but with more time to devote. They're going to take this cable now and stick it down your throat. So this is an obituary which should be right and fitting. For every clockwork cat and conceivable kitten."
you belong to me,"What are you girls gonna tell your mother?. I don't want to hear another word about young lovers. or hiding your boyfriend in the cupboard.. She's been to see the doctor, so you hope that she recovers.. You act dumb.. You say you're so numb.. You say you don't come. under his thumb.. Don't wanna be a goody-goody.. I don't want just anybody.. No, I don't want anybody. saying 'You belong to me. You belong to me.'. Your eyes are absent, your mouth is silent;. pumping like a fire hydrant.. Things you see are getting hard to swallow.. You're easily led, but you're much too scared to follow.. You've been warned.. You're going to get torn.."
you bowed down,"I expect you're entitled to know why I'm making contact. With acquaintances scattered all over the land. I'd promise you now and again that I'd honour the contract. If it hadn't crumbled away in my hand. So we broke that vow independently now. But I don't know why you absolutely deny. You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down). You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down). When you first looked away I might say it was really a kindness. It must have hurt you to see how dreams sour. Now they say that justice and love are the next things to blindness. Well you're getting plenty of both of them now. And so you parade where appointments are made. And never meant to be kept. Unless you accept. You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down). You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down). You value the burnt amber of falling leaves. And you long to delay. As you feel their breath as they whisper. ""It won't hurt you now to betray. If you just bow down"". And now every time that we meet on the edge of hysteria. You're helping them sell off some new party line. I remember a time when you would have seemed so superior. Now you say ""Will you please meet this good friend of mine?"". So you're in demand as long as you kiss their hand. But all the applause is for their name not yours. You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down). You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down). You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down). You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down). You bowed down. You bowed down. You bowed down."
you left me in the dark,"See how the elements obey?. Eyes are blue. Skies are grey. Nothing I do can make you stay. I'm glad it will rain today. You left me standing alone. Although I thought that we could not be parted. But if I'd only known. That this would be the last loving remark. You left me in the dark. Then I awoke to my dismay. I thought we'd make it all the way. Allowing myself one more clichÃ©. The last hurrah, the first bouquet. You left me standing alone although. I thought that we could not be parted. But if I'd only known. That this would be the last loving remark."
you little fool,"Daddy's best girl in the world is not supposed to have a boyfriend. But she's never wanted at home. Other girls are allowed to wear their makeup. She sneaks out her lipstick powder and comb. She surrounds his name with hearts and flowers. Talks on the telephone for hours and hours. But with the bird in his hand. And two on a string. The words of love have an imitation ring. You little fool, you little fool. I suppose that your going to stay all night. You little fool. Don't look at me that way you know it isn't right. You little fool. They say no news is good news. The little girl wants information. Mother just gives her some pills to choose. And says go and use your imagination. Daddy's best girl in the world says just look what I have got. As she sits beside him on the high stool. With his arm around her neck snowball in one hand. And the other full of imitation jewels. She fingers a string of pearls. An imitation but he'll never know it. Imitation lashes flutter above. Looking for an imitation of love. You little fool. I suppose that your going to stay all night. You little fool. So don't look at me that way you know it isn't right. You little fool."
you shouldn't look at me that way,Am I fine? Am I pleasing?. Are you pitying? Are you teasing?. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Should a glance from you just shoot through me. If a glimpse of you could undo me. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Time among all of your enemies. Leaves you nothing but bitter memories. From the first splash of affection. To avoiding your own reflection. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Now the flashbulbs bedazzle. While you're figuring out the spasm. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Don't take more than I offer. All my love or I'll make you suffer. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. Time among all of your enemies. Makes disguises from drastic melodies. From the first splash of detection. To avoiding your own reflection. You shouldn't look at me. You shouldn't look at me that way. . You shouldn't look at me that way
you stole my bell,"There is a place. Underneath the staircase. Where I keep the evidence. Of what once would offer peace. In a deep blue velvet box filled with joy and pride. Should I pick the locks?. Should I peek inside?. Can I stand the sight of those happy days?. Should I strike a match, burn them all away?. Cos you stole my bell. And you broke my chime. And the clock spins round but it won't keep time. There are many lovely girls in this cold and loveless world. But not one is the equal of you, heaven knows how much I love you (x2). So here we are. But it's not quite like we thought. Those things were priceless then. Now I know they can't be bought. In a deep blue velvet box fastened with a pin. Should I lift the lid?. Should I look within?. Was it my last chance or my first mistake?. Is it just a step that we'll never take?. Cos you stole my bell. And you broke my chime. And the clock spins round but it won't keep time. There are many lovely girls in this cold and loveless world."
you tripped at every step,"Take your tiny feet out of your mother's shoes. Or there is going to be a terrible scene. It's not just the lipstick drawn on crooked. When they find how wicked we are. How wicked we have been. How I've been tempted. CHORUS:. How you tripped at every step. You tripped at every step, you tripped at every step. How you tripped at every step. There's a merry tune that starts in ""I"". And ends in ""You,"" like many famous pop songs do. You would sing along with little tell-tale staggers. While balancing on daggers. Though they were killing you. You looked so deadly. CHORUS. And I would try to catch you. Anytime you call. Only you drank that potion. And went out of control. There's nothing to stop you. So how can you fall?. Let me take your hand. Put down that frying pan. Darkness would become me underneath the table. As the fury raged around the house. Your despairing tread was angry and unstable. You never suspected. Just as that cartoon mouse. Went undetected. So you tripped at every step. In another world of gin and cigarettes. Those cocktail cabinets put mud in your eye. Maybe that is why you find it hard to see me. And if you don't believe me. Before you start to cry. ""Don't ever leave me"". As you start to lose your grip. (Once you start losing your grip). You will stumble as you slip. (And you will stumble and slip). As you tripped at every step. You tripped at every step, you tripped at every step."
you turned to me,You turned to me. And all at once. I knew I was betrayed. My eyes met yours just down the darkened path. Where both of us had strayed. Nothing good can come out of this. I know it may not be. But just then you turned to me. And I thought for a moment. Like the fool that I've become. I might be the one. To turn these lights back on. Just as I began to say. It's never worth the price you pay. I was going there anyway. You turned to me. And all at once. I knew that you had seen. How I was lost in something quite like love. When all I did was dream. Now as evening becomes the dawn. I wonder where you'll be.
you want her too,"She makes me go so wrong. (Yeah, you kept me away, you know you did). I've loved her oh, so long. (So why don't you come right out and say it, stupid?). She makes me do things I don't want to do. I don't know why I should be telling you. I know that you want her too. My intentions are quite sincere. (That's not what you said the other night). And all you can do is sneer. (So go ahead and kid yourself you're right). She makes me do things I don't want to do. I don't know why I should be telling you. I know that you want her too. I've got a better chance than you do. I know that you want her too. You're such a hopeless romantic. She told me you're so predictable and nice. She only did you a favor once or twice. Once or twice. She makes me go so wrong. (So why don't you lie back and enjoy it?). Oh, my conscience is clear and strong. (Yes, she says I'm just the boy for it). She makes me do things I don't want to do. I don't know why I should be telling you. I know that you want her too. I know that you want her too."
you'll never be a man,"You need protection from the physical art of conversation. Though the fist is mightier than the lip, it adds the aggravation. Bridge and Chorus:. I got the password. I got persuasion. A proposition for invasion of your privacy. Give yourself away and find the fake in me. You'll never be a man. No matter how many foreign bodies you can take. You'll never be a man. When you're half a woman and you're half awake. (1) With a face full of tears and a chemical shake. (2) Under the table with a chemical shake. Given half a chance, that I can take. Are you so superior, are you in such pain. Are you made out of porcelain?. When they made you they broke the cast. Don't wanna be first, I just want to last. You strike a profile on the low side of my imagination. My eyes climbed down to find the point of possible saturation. Bridge and Chorus."
you're no good,"Feeling better, now that we're through. Feeling better, cause I'm over you. I've learned my lesson, it left a scar. Now I see how you really are. You're no good, you're no good, you're no good. Baby, you're no good (I'm gonna say it again). You're no good, you're no good, you're no good. Baby, you're no good. I broke a heart, that's gentle and true. Yes, I broke a heart over someone like you. I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee. I wouldn't blame him if he said to me. You're no good, you're no good, you're no good. Baby, you're no good (I'm gonna say it again). You're no good, you're no good, you're no good. Baby, you're no good. I'm telling you now baby now, that I'm goin my way. Forget about me baby, cause I'm leaving this day. You're no good, you're no good, you're no good. Baby, you're no good (I'm gonna say it again). You're no good, you're no good, you're no good. Baby, you're no good"
your angel steps out of heaven,"You tell me you married an angel. She's made heaven out of your home. You say there couldn't be rainbows in heaven. 'Cause she's brought you happiness that you've never known. You may hate me for what I've to tell you. But you'll thank me for setting you right. While you work to keep angels in heaven. Your angel steps out of heaven each night. Her heaven's not the same as you're living in. It's any place where there's music and a free drink from him. So call her your angel, I won't say you're not right. But your angel steps out of heaven each night."
your mind is on vacation,"I see you laughin'. Right in my face. I guess I'm gonna have to. Put you in your place. Because if silence was golden. You couldn't raise a dime. Because your mind is on vacation. And your mouth is working overtime. You're quoting figures. And dropping names. You're tellin' stories. About the dames. You're over-laughin'. When things ain't funny. You're tryin' to sound. Like you're the big money, honey. If talk was criminal. You'd lead a life of crime. Because your mind is on vacation. And your mouth is working overtime. Life is short, talk is cheap. Don't go makin' promises that you can't keep. If you don't like this little song I'm singin'. Just grin and bear it. All I can say is if the rich shoe fits, wear it. If you must keep talkin', please try to make it rhyme. Because your mind is on vacation. And your mouth is working overtime. Well, I recall when we first met. It was on a Friday night. We spent two lovely hours together. And the world seemed all right. I'm beggin' you, baby, please stop that off-the-wall jive. 'Cause if you don't treat me no better. It's gonna be your funeral and my trial. Well, the Lord made the world and everything that's in it. The way my baby loves me, it's a sign that it's it [?]. She can love to heal the sick, she can love to raise the dead. You might think that I'm jokin', you better believe what I said. I'm beggin' you, babe, please stop that off-the-wall jive. Oh, if you don't treat me no better. It's gonna be your funeral and my trial. I see you laughin'. Right in my face. I guess I'm gonna have to put you in your place. 'Cause if talk was criminal. You'd lead a life of crime. Because your mind is on vacation."
