hotel california,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair. Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air. Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light. My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim. I had to stop for the night. There she stood in the doorway;. I heard the mission bell. And I was thinking to myself,. 'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'. Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way. There were voices down the corridor,. I thought I heard them say.... Welcome to the Hotel California. Such a lovely place. Such a lovely face. Plenty of room at the Hotel California. Any time of year, you can find it here. Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes-Benz. She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends. How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.. Some dance to remember, some dance to forget. So I called up the Captain,. 'Please bring me my wine'. He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty. nine'. And still those voices are calling from far away,. Wake you up in the middle of the night. Just to hear them say.... Welcome to the Hotel California. Such a lovely place. Such a lovely face. They livin' it up at the Hotel California. What a nice surprise, bring your alibis. Mirrors on the ceiling,. The pink champagne on ice. And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'. And in the master's chambers,. They gathered for the feast. The stab it with their steely knives,. But they just can't kill the beast. Last thing I remember, I was. Running for the door. I had to find the passage back. To the place I was before. 'Relax,' said the night man,. We are programmed to receive.. You can checkout any time you like,. but you can never leave!"
i want to break free,"I want to break free. I want to break free. I want to break free from your lies. You're so self satisfied I don't need you. I've got to break free.

God knows, God knows I've fallen in love.. It's strange but it's true. I can't get over the way you love me like you do. But I have to be sure. When I walk out that door. Oh how I want to be free, baby. Oh how I want to be free,. Oh how I want to break free.. But life still goes on. I can't get used to, living without, living without,. Living without you by my side.

I want, I want, I want, I want to break free."
emotion,"Its over and done,. But the heartache lives on inside. And who is the one you're clinging to,. instead of me tonight. And where are you now?. Now that I need you. Tears on my pillow. Wherever you go. I'll cry me a river. That leads to your ocean. You'll never see me fall apart. In the words of a broken heart. It's just emotion that's taken me over. Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul. But if you don't come back, come home to me darling. You know that there'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight. Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. I'm there at your side, a part of all the things you are. But you've got a part of someone else. You've gotta find your shining star. And where are you now?. Now that I need you. Tears on my pillow. Wherever you go. I'll cry me a river. That leads to your ocean. You'll never see me fall apart. In the words of a broken heart. It's just emotion that's taken me over. Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul. But if you don't come back, come home to me darling. You know that there'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight. Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight"
horse with no name,"On the first part of the journey. I was looking at all the life. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz. And the sky with no clouds. The heat was hot and the ground was dry. But the air was full of sound. I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la .... After two days in the desert sun. My skin began to turn red. After three days in the desert fun. I was looking at a river bed. And the story it told of a river that flowed. Made me sad to think it was dead. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la .... After nine days I let the horse run free. 'Cause the desert had turned to sea. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. there was sand and hills and rings. The ocean is a desert with it's life underground. And a perfect disguise above. Under the cities lies a heart made of ground. But the humans will give no love. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la ..."
glory of love,Tonight it's very clear. 'Cause we're both lying here. There's so many things I wanna say. I will always love you. I would never leave you alone. Sometimes I just forget.

have you ever seen the rain?,"Someone told me long ago. There's a calm before the storm. I know. It's been coming for some time. When it's over, so they say. It'll rain a sunny day. I know. Shinin' down like water. I wanna know. Have you ever seen the rain?. I wanna know. Have you ever seen the rain. Comin' down on a sunny day?. Yesterday and days before. Sun is cold and rain is hot. I know. Been that way for all my time. 'Til forever, on it goes. Through the circle, fast and slow. I know. It can't stop, I wonder. I wanna know. Have you ever seen the rain?. I wanna know. Have you ever seen the rain. Comin' down on a sunny day?. Yeah!. I wanna know. Have you ever seen the rain?. I wanna know. Have you ever seen the rain. Comin' down on a sunny day?"
wish you were here,"So, so you think you can tell. Heaven from Hell. Blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field. From a cold steel rail?. A smile from a veil?. Do you think you can tell?. did they get you to trade. Your heroes for ghosts?. Hot ashes for trees?. hot air for a cool breeze?. Cold comfort for change?. did you exchange. A walk on part in the war. For a lead role in a cage?. How I wish. How I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls. Swimming in a fish bowl. Year after year. Running over the same old ground. What have we found?. The same old fears. Wish you were here"
forever young,"Let's dance in style. let's dance for a while.. Heaven can wait. We're only watching the skies. Hoping for the best but expecting the worst.. Are you going to drop the bomb or not?. Let us die young or let us live forever. We don't have the power but we never say never.. Sitting in a sandpit. life is a short trip. The music is for the sad men.. Can you imagine when this race is won?. Turn our golden faces into the sun. Praising our leaders. we're getting in tune.. The music is played by the madmen.. Forever young. I want to be forever young.. Do you really want to live forever. forever - and ever?. Forever young. I want to be forever young.. Do you really want to live forever. forever, forever young.. Some are like water. some are like the heat. Some are a melody and some are the beat.. Sooner or later. they all will be gone.. Why don't they stay young?. It's so hard to get old without a cause. I don't want to perish like a fading horse.. Youth's like diamonds in the sun and diamonds are forever.. So many adventures couldn't happen today.. So many songs we forgot to play.. So many dreams swinging out of the blue - we'll let them come true.. Forever young. I want to be forever young.. Do you really want to live forever. forever - and ever?. Forever young. I want to be forever young.. Do you really want to live forever. forever, forever young.. Forever young. I want to be forever young.. Do you really want to live forever. forever - and ever?.

the logical song,"When I was young. It seemed that life was so wonderful. A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical. And all the birds in the trees. Well they'd be singing so happily. Oh joyfully, oh playfully watching me. But then they sent me away. To teach me how to be sensible. Logical, oh responsible, practical. And they showed me a world. Where I could be so dependable. Oh clinical, oh intellectual, cynical. There are times when all the world's asleep. The questions run too deep. For such a simple man. Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned. I know it sounds absurd. Please tell me who I am. Now watch what you say. Or they'll be calling you a radical. A liberal, oh fanatical, criminal. Oh won't you sign up your name. We'd like to feel you're. Acceptable, respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable. At night when all the world's asleep. The questions run soo deep. For such a simple man. Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned. I know it sounds absurd. Please tell me who I am, who I am, who I am, who I am"
baby i love your way,"Shadows grow so long before my eyes. And they're moving across the page. Suddenly the day turns into night. Far away from the city. Don't hesitate. 'Cause your love won't wait. Ooh baby I love your way. Wanna tell you I love your way. Wanna be with you night and day. Moon appears to shine and light the sky. With the help of some firefly. Wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine. I can see them under the pine. But don't hesitate. Cause your love won't wait. Ooh baby I love your way. Wanna tell you I love your way. Wanna be with you night and day. Well don't hesitate. Cause your love won't wait. I can see the sunset in your eyes. Brown and gray, blue besides. Clouds are stalking islands in the sun. I wish I could buy one. Out of season. Don't hesitate. Cause your love won't wait. Ooh baby I love your way. Wanna tell you I love your way. Wanna be with you night and day"
i just called to say i love you,"No New Year's Day to celebrate. No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away. No first of spring. No song to sing. In fact here's just another ordinary day. No April rain. No flowers bloom. No wedding Saturday within the month of June. But what it is, is something true. Made up of these three words that I must say to you. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care. I just called to say I love you. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. No summer's high. No warm July. No harvest moon to light one tender August night. No autumn breeze. No falling leaves. Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies. No Libra sun. No Halloween. No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring. But what it is, though old so new. To fill your heart like no three words could ever do. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care, I do. I just called to say I love you. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care, I do. I just called to say I love you.

wonderful tonight,"It's late in the evening. she's wondering what clothes to wear. She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair. And then she asks me, ""Do I look all right? "". And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight. "". We go to a party and everyone turns to see. This beautiful lady that's walking around with me. And then she asks me, ""Do you feel all right? "". And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight. "". I feel wonderful because I see. The love light in your eyes. And the wonder of it all. Is that you just don't realize how much I love you. It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head. So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed. And then I tell her, as I turn out the light. I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight. Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight. """
africa,"I hear the drums echoing tonight. But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation. She's coming in 12:30 flight. The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation. I stopped an old man along the way. Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies. He turned to me as if to say. ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"". It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa. Gonna take some time to do the things we never had. Oooh. The wild dogs cry out in the night. As they grow restless longing for some solitary company. I know that I must do what's right. As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengetti. I seek to cure what's deep inside. Frightened of this thing that I've become. It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa. Gonna take some time to do the things we never had. Oooh. Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you. It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa. I bless the rains down in Africa. I bless the rains down in Africa. I bless the rains down in Africa. I bless the rains down in Africa. Gonna take some time to do the things we never had. Oooh"
i don't wanna talk about it,"I can tell by your eyes that you've probably been crying forever. and the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you, they are mirror. I don't wanna talk about it, how you broke my heart. and if I stay here just a little bit longer. and if I stay here won't you listen to my heart, Oh, my heart. if I stand all alone will this shadow hide the colors of my heart. Blue for the tears, black for the night fears. the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you they are mirror. I don't wanna talk about it........"
i'll be over you,Some people live their dreams. Some people close their eyes. Some people's destiny. Passes by. There are no guarantees. There are no alibis. That's how our love must be. Don't ask why. [Bridge:]. It takes some time. God knows how long. I know that I can forget you. As soon as my heart stops breakin'. Anticipating. As soon as forever is through. I'll be over you. Remembering times gone by. Promises we once made. What are the reasons why. Nothing stays the same. [Bridge:]. There were the nights holding you close. Someday I'll try to forget them. Someday I'll be over you

goodbye yellow brick road,When are you gonna come down. When are you going to land. I should have stayed on the farm. I should have listened to my old man. You know you can't hold me forever. I didn't sign up with you. I'm not a present for your friends to open. This boy's too young to be singing the blues. So goodbye yellow brick road. Where the dogs of society howl. You can't plant me in your penthouse. I'm going back to my plough. Back to the howling old owl in the woods. Hunting the horny back toad. Oh I've finally decided my future lies. Beyond the yellow brick road. What do you think you'll do then. I bet that'll shoot down your plane. It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics. To set you on your feet again. Maybe you'll get a replacement. There's plenty like me to be found. Mongrels who ain't got a penny. Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

africa,"I hear the drums echoing tonight. But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation. She's coming in 12:30 flight. The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation. I stopped an old man along the way. Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies. He turned to me as if to say. ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"". It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa. Gonna take some time to do the things we never had. Oooh. The wild dogs cry out in the night. As they grow restless longing for some solitary company. I know that I must do what's right. As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengetti. I seek to cure what's deep inside. Frightened of this thing that I've become. It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa. Gonna take some time to do the things we never had. Oooh. Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you. It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.

all my love,"Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light. to chase a feather in the wind. within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight. There moves a thread that has no end.

All of my love, all of my love, all of my love to you...

i just called to say i love you,"No New Year's Day to celebrate. No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away. No first of spring. No song to sing. In fact here's just another ordinary day. No April rain. No flowers bloom. No wedding Saturday within the month of June. But what it is, is something true. Made up of these three words that I must say to you. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care. I just called to say I love you. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. No summer's high. No warm July. No harvest moon to light one tender August night. No autumn breeze. No falling leaves. Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies. No Libra sun. No Halloween. No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring. But what it is, though old so new. To fill your heart like no three words could ever do. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care, I do. I just called to say I love you. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care, I do. I just called to say I love you.

Someday I'll be over you

Beautiful mcmansions on a hill. That overlook a highway. With riverboat casinos and you still. Have yet to see a soul. Jesusland. Jesusland. Town to town. Broadcast to each house, they drop your name. But no one knows your face. Billboards quoting things you'd never say. You hang your head and pray. For jesusland. Jesusland. Miles and miles. And the sun goin' down. Pulses glow. From their homes. You're not alone. Lights come on. As you lay your weary head on their lawn. Parking lots. Cracked and growing grass you see it all. From offices to farms. Crosses flying high above the malls. A longer walk. Through jesusland. Jesusland"

show me the way,"I wonder how you're feeling. There's ringing in my ears. And no one to relate to except the sea. Who can I believe in?. I'm kneeling on the floor. There has to be a force. Who do I phone?. The stars are out and shinning. But all I really want to know. Oh, won't you show me the way everyday?. I want you, show me the way. Well, I can see no reason. You're living on your nerves. When someone drops a cup and I submerge. I'm swimming in a circle. I feel I'm going down. There has to be a fool to play my part. Well someone thought of healing. But all I really want to know. Oh, won't you show me the way everyday?. I want you, show me the way. Ohh, I want you day after day. I wonder if I'm dreaming. I feel so unashamed. I can't believe this is happening to me. I watch you when you're sleeping. And then I want to take your love. Oh, won't you show me the way everyday?. I want you, show me the way. One more time. I want you day after day, hey. I want you day after day, hey. I want you, show me the way everyday. I want you, show me the way night and day. I want you day after day hey, ohh"
skyline pigeon,"Turn me loose from your hands. Let me fly to distant lands. Over green fields, trees and mountains. Flowers and forest fountains. Home along the lanes of the skyway. For this dark and lonely room. Projects a shadow cast in gloom. And my eyes are mirrors. Of the world outside. Thinking of the way. That the wind can turn the tide. And these shadows turn. From purple into grey. For just a Skyline Pigeon. Dreaming of the open. Waiting for the day. He can spread his wings. And fly away again. Fly away skyline pigeon fly. Towards the dreams. You've left so very far behind. Just let me wake up in the morning. To the smell of new mown hay. To laugh and cry, to live and die. In the brightness of my day. I want to hear the pealing bells. Of distant churches sing. But most of all please free me. From this aching metal ring. And open out this cage towards the sun"

smoke on the water,"We all came out to Montreaux. On the Lake Geneva shoreline. To make records with a mobile. We didn't have much time. Frank Zappa and the Mothers. Were at the best place around. But some stupid with a flare gun. Burned the place to the ground. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. They burned down the gambling house. It died with an awful sound. Funky & Claude was running in and out. Pulling kids out the ground. When it all was over. We had to find another place. But Swiss time was running out. It seemed that we would lose the race. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. We ended up at the Grand Hotel. It was empty, cold and bare. But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside. Making our music there. With a few red lights and a few old beds. We made a place to sweat. No matter what we get out of this. I know we'll never forget. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky"

sunday bloody sunday,"I can't believe the news today. Oh, I can't close my eyes. And make it go away. How long. How long must we sing this song. How long, how long. 'cause tonight... we can be as one. Tonight. Broken bottles under children's feet. Bodies strewn across the dead end street. But I won't heed the battle call. It puts my back up. Puts my back up against the wall. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. And the battle's just begun. There's many lost, but tell me who has won. The trench is dug within our hearts. And mothers, children, brothers, sisters. Torn apart. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. How long. How long must we sing this song. How long, how long. 'cause tonight... we can be as one. Tonight... tonight. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Wipe the tears from your eyes. Wipe your tears away. Oh, wipe your tears away. Oh, wipe your tears away. (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes. (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). And it's true we are immune. When fact is fiction and Tv reality. And today the millions cry. We eat and drink while tomorrow they die.

tears in heaven,"Would you know my name if I saw you in Heaven?. Would it be the same if I saw you in Heaven?. I must be strong and carry on,. 'Cause I know I don't belong here in Heaven.. Would you hold my hand if I saw you in Heaven?. Would you help me stand if I saw you in Heaven?. I'll find my way through night and day,. 'Cause I know I just can't stay here in Heaven..

the boxer,"I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told.. I have squandered my resistance,. For a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises.. All lies and jest.. Still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.. When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy,. In the company of strangers,. In the quiet of a railway station, runnin' scared.. Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters,. Where the ragged people go.. Lookin' for the places, only they would know.. Lie-la-lie .... Asking only workman's wages I come lookin' for a job,. But I get no offers,. Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue.. I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome,. I took some comfort there.. Oooh la, la, la .... And the years are rollin' by me.. They are rockin' evenly.. I am older than I once was, and younger than I'll be.. That's not unusual.. It isn't strange,. After changes upon changes, we are more or less the same.. After changes, we are more or less the same.. Lie-la-lie .... Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,. Going home, where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me.. Leadin' me, to goin' home.. In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade,. And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down,. Or cut him 'til he cried out in his anger and his shame,. ""I am leaving, I am leaving."". But the fighter still remains."
the logical song,"When I was young. It seemed that life was so wonderful. A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical. And all the birds in the trees. Well they'd be singing so happily. Oh joyfully, oh playfully watching me. But then they sent me away. To teach me how to be sensible. Logical, oh responsible, practical. And they showed me a world. Where I could be so dependable. Oh clinical, oh intellectual, cynical. There are times when all the world's asleep. The questions run too deep. For such a simple man. Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned. I know it sounds absurd. Please tell me who I am. Now watch what you say. Or they'll be calling you a radical. A liberal, oh fanatical, criminal. Oh won't you sign up your name. We'd like to feel you're. Acceptable, respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable. At night when all the world's asleep. The questions run soo deep. For such a simple man. Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned. I know it sounds absurd. Please tell me who I am, who I am, who I am, who I am"

Riding out the day's events. The river. What you say about his company. Is what you say about society. Catch the mist. Catch the myth. Catch the mystery. Catch the drift. The world is the world is. Love and life are deep. Maybe as his skies are wide. Today's Tom Sawyer. He gets high on you. And the space he invades. He gets by on you. No, his mind is not for rent. To any god or government. Always hopeful, yet discontent. He knows changes aren't permanent. But change is. What you say about his company. Is what you say about society. Catch the witness. Catch the wit. Catch the spirit. Catch the spit. The world is the world is. Love and life are deep. Maybe as his eyes are wide. Exit the warrior. Today's Tom Sawyer. He gets high on you. And the energy you trade. He gets right on to. The friction of the day"
