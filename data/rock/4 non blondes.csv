Come follow me, you won't expect the illusion. You'll see, it's my imagination. Hand me your eyes. I will put them in front of mine. You'll see a little better. You'll see a little better. What a wonderful destination. Where I am now, I can no longer see. Dropped another pill just to kill me. Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep.
