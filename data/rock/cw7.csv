rolling in the deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart. Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark. Finally I can see you crystal clear. Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare. See how I leave with every piece of you. Don't underestimate the things that I will do. There's a fire starting in my heart. Reaching a fever pitch. And it's bringing me out the dark. The scars of your love remind me of us. They keep me thinking that we almost had it all. The scars of your love they leave me breathless. I can't help feeling. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. And you played it. To the beat. Baby I have no story to be told. But I've heard one of you. And I'm gonna make your head burn. Think of me in the depths of your despair. Making a home down there. As mine sure won't be shared. The scars of your love remind me of us. They keep me thinking that we almost had it all. The scars of your love they leave me breathless. I can't help feeling. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. And you played it. To the beat. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. But you played it. With the beating. Throw your soul through every open door. Count your blessings to find what you look for. Turned my sorrow into treasured gold. You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow. We could've had it all. We could've had it all. It all, it all it all,. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. And you played it. To the beat. We could've had it all. Rolling in the deep. You had my heart inside of your hand. But you played it. To the beat"
