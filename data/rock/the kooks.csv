violet hill,"Was a long and dark december. From the rooftops I remember. There was snow white snow. Clearly I remember. From the windows they were watching. While we froze down below. When the future's architectured. By a carnival of idiots on show. You'd better lie low. If you love me. Won't you let me know?. Was a long and dark december. When the banks became cathedrals. And a fox became god. Priests clutched onto bibles. Hollowed out to fit their rifles. And a cross held aloft. Bury me in armour. When I'm dead and hit the ground. My nerves are poles that unfroze. And if you love me. Won't you let me know?. I don't want to be a soldier. With the captain of some sinking ship. With stow, far below. So if you love me. Why'd you let me go?. I took my love down to violet hill. There we sat in snow. All that time she was silent still. Said if you love me won't you let me know?. If you love me won't you let me know?"

And oh so odd something new. Yes, I would like to walk away. Near your bosom I would gladly stay. But I'm only base in what I do. And if I was late then I'm sorry. And if I was you I'd be angry too. I'd be angry too but I'm not you. But if was late then I'm sorry girl. And if I was you I'd be angry too. I'd be angry too but I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. Loving me don't have to be hard.
