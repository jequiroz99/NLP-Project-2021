They took all his money and all that he had. But he smiled with his eyes. and his face was bright red. And spit would run from his mouth when he said. I wanna live till I die. 'Cause I am alive and there's blood in my arms. This is a day that is brighter than bombs. This is a day that is brighter than bombs. I will live till I die. Till I die. There's more inside of me than skin and bones. I am born again today and. all my sins are washed away. There's more inside of me than skin and bones. Jacob sat on the roof and he said. Some day the earth will cast out its dead. If you dwell in the dust then wake up and sing. I will live till I die. Jacob smiled when he said to me. I am not waiting on the Red Sea. To open up and rain pearls on me. I will live till I die. Till I die. There's more inside of me than skin and bones. I am born again today. and all my sins are washed away. There's more inside of me than skin and bones. As long as I live and there's blood in my arms. This is a day that is brighter than bombs. This is a day that is brighter than bombs.

song for jacob,"I saw Jacob, he lay in the street. He said the air out here is like amphetamine. And I never ever wanna sleep again. I wanna live till I die. They took all his money and all that he had. But he smiled with his eyes. and his face was bright red. And spit would run from his mouth when he said. I wanna live till I die. 'Cause I am alive and there's blood in my arms. This is a day that is brighter than bombs. This is a day that is brighter than bombs. I will live till I die. Till I die. There's more inside of me than skin and bones. I am born again today and. all my sins are washed away. There's more inside of me than skin and bones. Jacob sat on the roof and he said. Some day the earth will cast out its dead. If you dwell in the dust then wake up and sing. I will live till I die. Jacob smiled when he said to me. I am not waiting on the Red Sea. To open up and rain pearls on me. I will live till I die. Till I die. There's more inside of me than skin and bones. I am born again today. and all my sins are washed away. There's more inside of me than skin and bones. As long as I live and there's blood in my arms. This is a day that is brighter than bombs. This is a day that is brighter than bombs.
