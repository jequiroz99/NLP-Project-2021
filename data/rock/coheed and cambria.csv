in keeping secrets of silent earth: 3,"Broad incision sits across the evening. A victim to our fathers lost war. The restless children sit and mourn the graves. Of those they've never seen before. Will they be buried here among the dead,. In the silent secret?. The pioneers, in dealing with it they march for dawn. Of will and worthy. The truth be told the child was born. Man your own jackhammer. Man your battle stations. We'll have you dead pretty soon. Sincerely written from my brothers blood machine. Man your battle stations. We'll have you home pretty soon. A lurking motion with curious to curtain your first move. Oh through arms length they'll break protocol. Childish envy for the youngest one. To be the hero is all I'll ask. Can I be buried here among the dead?. With room to honor me here in the end. You'll be better off too soon. You'll be better off when you get home. The pioneers, in dealing with it they'll march for dawn. For will and worthy. The truth be told the child was born. Man your own jackhammer. Man your battle stations. We'll have you dead pretty soon. Sincerely written from my brothers blood machine. Man your battle stations. We'll have you home pretty soon. For you I'd do anything. Just to make you happy hear you tell me that your proud of me. For them I'd kill anything, cut the throats of babies. For them break they're hearts for they were them. Waiting for you to say... ""I love you too"". The navigator, the pilot, her favorite. The one they call the vision that bears the gift. The navigator, the pilot, her favorite. The one they call the vision that bears the gift. Will, do the children really understand the things you did to them?. And why, oh why should they conjure up the will,. For you my love I would kill... him. We're coming home pretty soon. Coming home.... In the seventh turning hour,. Will the victims shadow fall?. Should the irony grow hungry?. With the victory and all they sought for. we were one among the fence. One upon the fence. We're.... We're.... Coming.... Coming.... Now we're coming home.... Man your own jackhammer. Man your battle stations. We'll have you dead pretty soon now.... So tell me what for?. Why for this bloodless savior?. Man your battle stations. We'll have you home pretty soon. Till then...."
dark side of me,"In those discouraging days. I always missed the mark. When we were comfort and close. I would neglect to keep. Ooh, you safe and unexposed. A portrait of time repeats. This moment now replaced. With an empty wish to give. I give, I gave. I gave my everything. For all the wrong things. In this cold reality I made. This selfish war machine. Oh, this has become hell. How can I share this life. With someone else?. I promise you. There is no weight that can bury us. Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt. Here in the dark side of me. Here in the dark side of me. Now in your absence I wade. Through the coursing, lonely, lost. And in this tragic dismay. I never could believe what I became. I gave my everything. For all the wrong things. In this cold reality I made. This welcomed war machine. Oh, this has become hell. How can I share this life. With someone else?. I promise you. There is no weight that can bury us. Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt. [4x]. Here in the dark side of me. Here in the dark side of me. Ooh, I couldn't give you. What you needed. It's all my fault. Too coward to believe I lost it all. I gave my everything. For all the wrong things. In this cold reality I made. This selfish war machine. Oh, this has become hell. How can I share this life. With someone else?. I promise you. There is no weight that can bury us. Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt. [4x]. Here in the dark side of me. Here in the dark side of me. (By Daniel L. Gross)"
the broken,"I followed your every move. In a stride that wills disguise. A little markings clue defined. Your red lips speak of painted figures. The teeth of mangled little listeners. The thoughts that hide your rusty scissors in. And hold them in. Swinging honesty across this violence. Obscurity has no hero. The world looks better when you're falling. Grace to comfort enough to crawl in. Divided we must pray for the broken. no one could fix us. We are, we'll always be the wrong. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Your touch seeds of emptiness. The callous tips against the brush. The world's now breaking off to curse. The world looks better when you're falling. Grace to comfort enough to crawl in. Divided we must pray for the broken. no one could fix us. We are, we'll always be the wrong. We are conspiring. Where was your heart, when we needed it most?. Live in denial and I'll be your ghost. There is nothing to let go, only time will let you know. If you're worth anything, you'll know that I'm. Giving up way too early. let the axis turn you free. And destroy everything you love. The world looks better when you're falling. Grace to comfort enough to crawl in. Divided we must pray for the broken. no one could fix us. We are, we are. We are, we are. We are, we'll always be the wrong"

I'll live through this in a manner. cursed at my own accord. If my shame spills our worth across this floor. Then tonight, goodnight... I'm burning Star IV. Only I don't even think of you. No I don't want to think of you anymore. Goodnight, tonight, goodbye. Goodnight, tonight, goodbye. In my presence you might wake. Through this fiction I must fake.

From pressure to pain I wish to stay awake. In the measure I test with your love for me. So shout against these walls. With hope that one will break free. So hear me.... What is this that you keep selling me, boy?. I'm not gonna hold your hand here when you walk. You'll burn in hell while they're digging you out. You'll burn in hell while they're digging you out. I'm not gonna hold your hand here when you walk. You'll burn in hell while they're digging you out. You'll burn in hell while they're digging you out. So picture this face and burn it to flake. To shelter it at home at the fireplace. And all but memory will fade. With the flick of the flame. So I have a secret that no one should know. That I shouldn't tell. But of all the... but of all the worlds. This one won't feel.... This one just won't leave me well. What is this shit you keep selling me, boy?. I'm not gonna hold your hand here when you walk. You'll burn in hell while they're digging you out. You'll burn in hell while they're digging you out. I'm not gonna hold your hand here when you walk.

Breathe up through lust and I'll find your cure. In there I'll kill, kill. In there I'll kill, kill, kill. With your last breath of air. As the Earth comes trembling down. Would you give her this last night. And give up your life. With your last breath of air. As the Earth comes trembling down. Would you give her this last night. The love of your life.

fuel for the feeding end,"Is this what I wish for those and all they know?. Could depend on how cowardly I should act. If she won't give me the love I came here for. With pen I am armed here to react. Hey now, hey now what is it boy?. All the things that trouble you. So visit your mirror image. Of what might have once behaved. Hey now, hey now what is it boy?. But I won't rest till dead, till dead do you part. This is how I feel my God from what's been dealt. The flies that flutter fight tonight. Is it love that I'm feeling or is this hate the same. The emotion's enough to kill the sane. Hey now, hey now what is it boy?. All the things that trouble you. So visit your mirror image. Of what might have once behaved. Hey now, hey now what is it boy?. Besides, I only hope you know that I love you.. Oh I hope.. Feed little maggots off the Westside of your sin. Run little maggot do they learn of what you did. Feed little maggots off the Westside of your sin. Run little maggot do they learn of what you did. (Feliz sería que hora) [x4]. From start to finish I've made you feel this. Uncomfort in turn with the world you've learned. To love through this hate to live with its weight. A burden discerned in the blood you taste. Why would you deny me answers?. If I'm just a boy on the break of being. Horror and hell through its fires. Be brutally honest, was it better before me?. In the curve of your body. How I want, how I want her with me. The truth of the story. The Vishual, I wish you all. The better end of all to come. The truth be now here one by one. I am to you extend to none. The memory that fuels the fire. Watching his tale with the words he unfolds. Conscience and cold we'd never know. They scream as he laughs off the dust from his eyes. These words will now learn of the dreams in his mind. Could this be that hard for me?. To configure a new love in vain. To my new entity or banish it home to the grave. No one is safe. With the quickness strike out for the less of us doubt. Mercy of the man who put the pen in our mouth. Word write us well signed, ""Forgiveness for sale"". I'm through being full. Of all the might you want killed. The fiction will see the real. The answer will question still. In your body to blood as your parents once went. You will follow their lead one by one, every step. Could this be that hard for me?. To configure a new love in vain. To my new entity or banish it home to the grave. I will not save.... Your world. Your world in the end and you.. Your world. Your world. Te amo, Mary"

When she found it there in the cold, blue glare. The words distressed and unfamiliar where the feelings seared. An emptiness had hung, and in her chest, she clenched. Reality settled as the memories raced while on the screen he lived. She teared; ""Your selfishness has robbed you of the man you could've been. I wouldn't change a thing about you. I love you dearly, my friend"". If he's not here then where?. If he's not here then where?. My love, Been searching for my Afterman. If he's not here then where?. If he's not here then where?.

There is nothing to let go, only time will let you know. If you're worth anything, you'll know that I'm. Giving up way too early. let the axis turn you free. And destroy everything you love.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!. Here, emotions be whole. You've entered a hell where the devil is made of gold. Please, don't run your mouth. The questions before have no place in this haunted house. Reveal your selfish pleasure. One more time 'round for good measure. In the answer you hold. Time would be better off if our souls had been sold. Here where the Light only dies to remember. In a place where the blind truly can see. Hear my voice, dearly departed. I'll beg on my knees. It's been my pleasure. To serve your disease. Welcome home. Shed your skin and expose your bones. Take my hand. And follow us into the Black. So far that we can't get back. Here, dig me a grave. And toss in the lives that you can't be bothered to save. With their blood on your hands. You enjoy the sun while you shit in purest sand. Kiss your lover with that filthy mouth, you fucking monster. Here, his evil now gropes. It's caught us off guard with its hands reaching for our throats. Here where the Light only dies to remember. In a place where the blind truly can see. Hear my voice, dearly departed.

It's a shame, I fear. For men to start. We walk their lines. Born to play the fucking part. A shame, I fear. For men to start. We walk their lines. Born to play the fucking part. I fear we've got all we had wanted. Close your eyes and believe. It didn't happen. Now shut your mouth. Beyond your lies. The world knows to stay away from you. And the blood you let run. They march as you lead. We laugh in the sun. Maybe that's all we need. I. And I. And I'm sorry. You can't escape. Here where the Light only dies to remember. A place where the blind truly can see. Hear my voice, dearly departed. I'll beg on my knees. It's been my pleasure. To serve your disease. Welcome home. Shed your skin and expose your bones. Take my hand. And follow us into the Black.

Well if you're just, as I presumed. A whore in sheep's clothing. Fucking up all i do. The end, if so here we stop,. Then never again will you see. This in your life. Hang on to the glory at my right hand. Here lay to rest is a love ever long. With truth on the shores of confession. You seem to take privilege to all of these souls.. You stormed off to scar the armada. Like Jesus played martir. I'll drill through your hands. The stone for the curse you have blamed me. With love and devotion I'll die as you sleep. But if you could just write me out. To never mis-wonder her happy will I become. Be true that this is no option. So with it condemn you demon raiding in love.. Hang on to the glory at my right hand. Here lay to rest is a love ever long. With truth on the shores of confession. You seem to take privilege to all of these souls.. One last kiss for you. One more wish to you. Please make up your mind girl. I'd do anything for you. One last kiss for you. One more wish to you. Please make up your mind girl. Before I hope you die. by kenshindapri"
world of lines,"This is the hidden truth,. the world between the lines. Where there is no understanding us. These lines have marked divisions,. the weaker seek to malign. With this looming precious ending. there's no more room for reprimanding. Oh, when words are lightly thrown. In a world that's caught in a writer's web. humiliation reigns. Just leave us alone. If it's not worth the letting go. it's trouble, woah, woah. Just leave us alone. If it's not worth the letting go. it's trouble, woah, woah. Communications breaking up,. the static cutting the line. This lying liar's had his turn. You've managed nothing more. than a pathetic attempt at attack. This heart is everlasting,. pushing forward, never crashing. Just leave us alone. If it's not worth the letting go. it's trouble, woah, woah. Just leave us alone. If it's not worth the letting go. it's trouble, woah, woah. State your case and go hide. Leave us to your worst,. I will never give in. to the hurt of your lies. Cause' there is no hope. for all your jokes. and your plaguing insecurity. Now I'll play your enemy,. the only word you can find for me. Just leave us alone. If it's not worth the letting go. it's trouble, woah, woah. Just leave us alone. If it's not worth the letting go. it's trouble, woah, woah. (This world of lines, the strong will decide). Just leave us alone. If it's not worth the letting go. it's trouble, woah, woah. (This world of lines, the strong will decide). Just leave us alone. If it's not worth the letting go. it's trouble, woah, woah. (@rodrigoms)"
"you got spirit, kid","You...you keep on screaming from the top of your lungs. Mister Who-gives-a-shit, just shut up. Oh, the podium is all yours, go right ahead. The plastic king of castle polyethylene. Go on, time to be a good little pig. You're worth it or you're so, so. Cause when the rug gets pulled out from underneath. Just embrace the fall. Oh you got spirit, kid. You're number one. Go on living that farce. Cause nobody gives a fuck who you are. You...I'll never have the chance that you got. No, oh, I won't dwell. I'll just accept I'll be forgot...forgotten. Cause when the rug gets pulled out from underneath. Just embrace the fall. Oh you got spirit, kid. You're number one. Go on living that farce. Cause nobody gives a fuck who you are. So why are you crying?. So why are you crying?. When you've got the world. When you've got the world. To command. Cause when the rug gets pulled out from underneath. Just embrace the fall. Oh you got spirit, kid. You're number one. Go on living that farce. Cause nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, no-o-o. Nobody gives a fuck. Nobody gives. Nobody gives a fuck. Cause nobody gives a fuck who you are"
young love,"4 Am, blank t. v. Screen. Inside voice, the need to scream. The boards they creek, the wood it moans. These walls could share the things they know. Oh, I had to let you go. Leave you alone, this broken home. You gave us so much. You believed in us, and we broke your trust. We leave for the coast. In the wrong hands. You were bruised, disposed. Oh please try and understand. It was young love, learning its place. Running away. Goodnight moon, goodnight earth. This picture screams a thousand words. This portrait shows an unhappy man. Who did all he could, all he can. You gave us so much. You believed in us, and we broke your trust. We leave for the coast. In the wrong hands. You where bruised, disposed. Oh please try and understand. It was young love, learning its place. Running away. Running away. Running away. Running away"
