chasing rainbows,"They drag me underground. The lights are slowly fading. The world I thought I knew. I never knew at all. The dead don't make a sound. Unless you're chasing rainbows. And then they scream your name. Clawing at the gates. So pull me out. And hold me down. Let's find a way. To lose ourselves. Take me to the sun. I feel I'm chasing rainbows. And now I'm lost and all alone. Waiting for a chance to. Sink my teeth into. Another desperation. Now into your lonely. Paradise. Are we just dreaming. In the city that never sleeps?. 'Cause I can't be seeing. What my eyes tell me. Am I just dreaming?. This can't be in my veins. Everything I ever knew. Will never be the same. (So chew me up, and spit me out. Let's take a way to save ourselves). So pull me out. And hold me down. Let's find a way. To lose ourselves. Take me to the sun. I feel I'm chasing rainbows. And now I'm lost and all alone. Waiting for a chance to. Sink my teeth into. Another desperation. Now into your lonely. Paradise. And now I feel it. Yeah, I feel it in my blood. I can't fight this anymore. I've given up. I've given up. Take me to the sun. I feel I'm chasing rainbows. And now I'm lost and all alone. Waiting for a chance to. Sink my teeth into. Another desperation. Now into your lonely. Paradise. Take me to the sun. I feel I'm chasing rainbows. And now I'm lost and all alone. Waiting for a chance to. Sink my teeth into. Another desperation. Now into your lonely. Paradise"

the fox and the wolf,"You said you can't get to heaven unless you get high. But there's no word of hell on the way back down. You said it's now or never,. You only live once. Would you be so quick to walk over to my grave?. You said you'll never be younger than you are tonight. Now I've never felt weaker in all my life. You said it's only a one off, only a line. But now it's a circle, all of the time. Well, it's a one man cult and he's serving his line. It's a ""Lust For Life"" but it's a lifeless wine. He kissed her hand and then he found out her name,. It's Death and now he can't seem to wake. You can't run with the foxes and yet hunt with the wolf. Are you addicted?. Tell me the truth. I think I'm losing my mind. They say the poison's in the dosage and they must be right. Left with panic attacks and death riding our backs. It all looks so much worse on the way back down. I'm so fucked up since I hit the ground"
the house of wolves,"Show me a sign, show me a reason to give,. A solitary fuck about your god damn beliefs. I'm going blind, but one thing's clear. Death is the only salvation you'll fear. Brick by brick by brick. Brick by brick by brick. What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse. Cloak and daggers murder the truth. The bitter taste, there's nothing else. I'll bow for your king when he shows himself. Brick by brick by brick. These walls begin to cave in. The house of wolves you built. Whispers in a thousand tongues. Show me your face, show me a reason to think,. My soul can be saved if I sell you my sins. I'm going blind, but one thing's clear. Death is the only salvation for me. Brick by brick by brick. These walls begin to cave in. The house of wolves you built. Whispers in a thousand tongues. (The house of wolves you built). (The nest of wolves you built). The house of wolves you built. Will burn just like a thousand suns. So when you die, the only kingdom you'll see. Is 2 foot wide and 6 foot deep. Yeah!. And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see. Is 2 foot wide and 6 foot deep. And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see. Is 2 foot wide and 6 foot deep, Oh!. Brick by brick by brick. Brick by brick by brick. Brick by brick by brick. These walls begin to cave in. The house of wolves you built. Whispers in a thousand tongues. Brick by brick by brick. These walls begin to cave in. The house of wolves you built. Will burn just like a thousand suns. You said you want me. Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here. You said you want me. Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here."
the sadness will never end,"Our legs begin to break. We've walked this path for far too long. My lungs, they start to ache. But still we carry on. I'm choking on my words. Like I got a noose around my neck. I can't believe it's come to this. I can't believe it's come to this. And dear, I fear. That this ship is sinking tonight. I won't give up on you. These scars won't tear us apart. So don't give up on me. It's not too late for us. And I'll save you from yourself. And I'll save you from yourself. Our legs begin to break. We've walked this path for far too long. My lungs begin to ache. But still we carry on. I'm choking on my words. Like I got a noose around my neck. I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not coming home tonight. 'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear. I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not coming home tonight. 'Cause dear I fear. This ship is sinking. Is there hope for us?. Can we make it out alive?. I can taste the failure on your lips. Is there hope for us?. Can we make it out alive?. I can taste the failure. Close your eyes. There's nothing we can do. But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves. You're trapped in your past. Like it's six feet under. I won't give up on you. These scars won't tear us apart. So don't give up on me. It's not too late for us. I'll save you from yourself. I'll save you from yourself. I'll save you from yourself. I'll save you from yourself. Try to numb the pain. With alcohol and pills. But it won't repair your trust. You can't stand on two fucking feet. With a substance as a crutch. I won't give up. I won't give up on you. We'll play this symphony. I won't give up. I won't give up on you. We'll play this symphony of sympathy. I won't give up. I won't give up on you. We'll play this symphony of sympathy. I won't give up. I won't give up on you. We'll play this symphony of sympathy"

who wants flowers when you're dead? nobody,"This cherry sunset withers. Our words, as frail as paper. A dawn I thought we'd never see. Alone, on this silent beach. There is nothing we can do. There is nothing we can do. The sky, it burns itself out. The sky, it burns itself out. The sky, it burns itself out. The sky, it burns itself. The trees rot down to nothing. Throats dry out and corpses fill the sidewalks. These promenades, our graveyards. The sky, it burns itself out. The sky, it burns itself out. There is nothing we can do. The sky, it burns itself. And I think we're all about to fucking die. The trees rot down to nothing. Throats dry out, and corpses fill these sidewalks. These promenades, our graveyards. Kneeling down on what's left, sacrificed upon doom's day. Oh, if we could take it back and see one last twilight. Take a picture, take a picture. Take a picture, take a picture. Take a picture. Take a picture, take a picture. Take a picture, take a picture. It will last longer. Our hands in prayer formation. Our elbows on the bed. One last try for Heaven. Thinking who wants flowers when you're dead?. You're dead. When you're dead. Cherry, cherry. Cherry, cherry. Cherry, cherry. Cherry, cherry. Cherry. A cherry sunset"
