we belong,"Many times I've tried to tell you. Many times I've cried alone. Always I'm surprised how well you. Cut my feelings to the bone. Don't want to leave you really. I've invested too much time. To give you up that easy. To the doubts that complicate your mind. Chorus:. We Belong to the light. We Belong to the thunder. We Belong to the sound of the words. We've both fallen under. Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We Belong, We Belong. We Belong together. Maybe it's a sign of weakness. When I don't know what to say. Maybe I just wouldn't know. What to do with my strength anyway. Have we become a habit. Do we distort the facts. Now there's no looking forward. Now there's no turning back. When you say. (Chorus). Close your eyes and try to sleep now. Close your eyes and try to dream. Clear your mind and do your best. To try and wash the palette clean. We can't begin to know it. How much we really care. I hear your voice inside me. I see your face everywhere. Still you say. (Chorus). ."
love is a battlefield,"We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demands. Love Is A Battlefield. We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong. Searchin' our hearts for so long, both of us knowing. Love Is A Battlefield. You're beggin' me to go, you're makin' me stay. Why do you hurt me so bad?. It would help me to know. Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?. Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why. But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side. We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demands. Love Is A Battlefield. We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong. Searchin' our hearts for so long, both of us knowing. Love Is A Battlefield. We're losing control. Will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?. And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?. There's no way this will die. But if we get much closer, I could lose control. And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold. We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demands. Love Is A Battlefield. We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong. Searchin' our hearts for so long, both of us knowing. Love Is A Battlefield. We are young, heartache to heartache we stand. No promises, no demands. Love Is A Battlefield. We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong. Searchin' our hearts for so long, both of us knowing. Love Is A Battlefield."

Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away. Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know. Where all our Dirty Little Secrets go. Sometimes it hurt so bad that you cry. Then there's the times you wish you had died. Sometimes the truth is worse than the lie, sometimes. Sometimes it's best to lock it away. In a place that's secret and safe. Sometimes you just pretend you don't know. Sometimes it's best to let go. Sometimes I believed, what you had to say. Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away.

shooting star,"Description: Man loves woman. Man marries woman. Man and woman have children. Man leaves woman in search of self. Man realizes how important woman is and returns.. He was crazy of course. From the first she must have known it. But still she went on with him. And she never once had shown it. And she took him off the streets. And she dried his tears of grievin'g. She listened to his visions. She believed in his believin'. Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle. And she was the moon shining back his light a little. He was a shooting star. She was softer and more slowly. He could not make things possible. But, she could make them holy, holy.... He was dancin' to some music. No one else had ever heard. He'd speak in unknown languages. She'd translate every word. And when the world was laughing. At his castles in the sky. She'd hold him in her body. And he once again would fly. Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle. And she was the moon shining back his light a little. He was a shooting star. She was softer and more slowly. He could not make things possible. But, she could make them holy, holy.... But she gave him a daughter. And she gave him a son. She was a mother, and a wife,. And a lover when the day was done. Well, he was too far gone for giving love. What he'd offer in its stead. Was the knowledge she was the only thing. That was not in his head. He took off East one morning. In the rising sun's red glow. She knew he was going nowhere. But of course she let him go. As she stood and watched him dwindle. Much too empty to be sad. He reappeared beside her and said,. ""You're all I've ever had"". Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle. And she was the moon shining back his light a little. He was a shooting star. She was softer and more slowly. He could not make things possible. But, she could make them holy. Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle. And she was the moon shining back his light a little. He was a shooting star. She was softer and more slowly. He could not make things possible. But, she could make them holy. Holy.... From the album ""Harry Chapin Tribute"" (1990). Written by: Harry Chapin."
le bel age,"There comes a time, when you should see things clear. Free from my innocence, there is no circumstance too severe. Only the need for us, for us to believe again.

strawberry wine (life is sweet),"How am I supposed to make it through another day. What am I supposed to do now that you've gone away. Is there anything encouraging you can say to me. Did you really think my heart was made of stone. Maybe you never gave it any thought at all. How nice to go through live oblivious and free. Life is sweet, sweet as Strawberry Wine. And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine. And you are that, you are more than sublime. And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience. How am I supposed to ever feel the same. These kind of situations always have a way. Of screwing up your mind and messing with your sanity. How many days and nights will have to come and go. Before I realize what I already know. I'm better off without you like I thought I'd be. Life is sweet, sweet as Strawberry Wine. And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine. And you are that, you are more than sublime. And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience. (Spoken) Life is sweet. Life is sweet, sweet as Strawberry Wine. And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine.

Brings you back into my life, and turn this darkness into light. I'm all alone in this house, turn this house into a home. I need your touch to comfort me. Your tender, tender arms that once held me. Without your love, your love inside. This house is just a place to run and hide. 7 rooms, that's all it is. 7 Rooms Of Gloom. I live with emptiness, without your tenderness. Don't make me live from day to day. Watching a clock that ticks away. Another day, another way, another reason for me to say. I need you here, here with me. I need you darling, desperately. I'm all alone, all alone in this house that's not a home. I miss your love, I once had known. I miss your kiss that was my very, very own. In the silence that surrounds me, lonely walls - they stand. 7 rooms, that's all it is. 7 Rooms Of Gloom. I live with emptiness, without your tenderness. And all the windows are painted black. I'll wait right here until you get back. I'll keep waiting, and waiting, until your face again I see. Darling, Yeah Hea, Huh. I want you back now. I keep waiting, and waiting. I want you back now.

art of letting go,"(P. Brown, R. Feldman, M. Grombacher). Here we go again, 'round and 'round again, gettin' nowhere fast. It's the same old game, one more final same, never meant to last.

A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.. Black velvet if you please.. Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave.. White lightning, bound to drive you wild.. Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl.. ""Love me tender"" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle.. The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true.. Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for.. Black velvet and that little boy's smile.. Black velvet with that slow southern style.. A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.. Black velvet if you please.. Every word of every song that he sang was for you.. In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon, what could you do?. Black velvet and that little boy's smile.. Black velvet with that slow southern style.. A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.. Black velvet if you please.. Black velvet and that little boy's smile.. Black velvet with that slow southern style.. A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.. Black velvet if you please.. If you please.. If you please.. If you please."
bloodshot eyes,"Now just because your pretty, and you think you're mighty wise. You tell me that you love me, then you roll those big brown eyes. When I saw you last week, your eyes were turnin' black. Go find the guy that beat you up - ask him to take you back. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. I can tell you've been out on a spree. Well it's plain that you're lyin'. When you say that you've been cryin'. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. I used to spend my money, to make you look real sweet. I wanted to be proud of you when we walked down the street. Now don't ask me to dress you up, in satin and in silk. Your eyes look like two cherries in a glass of bottled milk. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. I can tell you've been out on a spree. Well it's plain that you're lyin'. When you say that you've been cryin'. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. So I guess our little romance has finally simmered down. You should join the circus, you make a real good clown. Your eyes look like a roadmap, I'm scared to smell your breath. You better shut your peepers before you bleed to death. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. I can tell you've been out on a spree. Well it's plain that you're lyin'. When you say that you've been cryin'. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me. From the album ""True Love""."
brave,"I remember the night. When destiny finally found us. I remember holding on. When the stars were crashin' all around us. We thought that the world was ending. But you know it wasn't true. â€˜Cause I still love you. I still love you. [Chorus]. I'll be brave for you. And every day I pray for you. We can be strong in each other's arms. And I'll be brave, I'll be brave for you. I know that you're afraid. You know that I'm afraid, too. But you gotta have faith; you gotta listen. To what your heart is telling you. You know love's a funny thing. You just gotta let it be. Like you and me; you and me. [Chorus]. Just look at the sky above us. Let the sun shine down on us. Stand with me here together. In the light of love now."
brokenhearted,"I see them everyday; they're like shadows. Tryin' to run from the pain. But you know the pain, it always follows. So there's nowhere to go, not really. Sometimes I want to touch them. Try and set them free. But I'm afraid I might know them. Or they will recognize me. Where do they go? The brokenhearted. Do they travel alone when they carry that weight. Do they disappear without a trace. Look into the eyes of those who know. Can you tell me, where do they go?. Is there a place that they go to. That's for them alone. Where memories are sacred. And heartache has no home. I see them here in the moonlight. Searching for a sign. That love is out there waiting. Waiting for the right time. Where do they go? The brokenhearted. Do they travel alone when they carry that weight. Do they try to return to where they started. Do they disappear without a trace. Look into the eyes of those who know. Can you tell me where do they go?. The power of love gives them strength to carry on."
cerebral man,"What's your line this time, Cerebral Man. Whenever you walk through my door, I start to sweat. I'm falling in slow motion, and I'm losing control. And the walls are too high to jump. The walls are to high to jump. I hear thunder, it's in my soul. Can you hear the thunder roar, you better get back. I hear thunder, who's in control. Can you hear the thunder roar. Better get back, Cerebral Man. The cutting edge, it hides behind those eyes of woe. Your tears won't make a bed of roses. What we had I cannot love. The walls are to high to jump. The walls are to high to jump. I hear thunder, it's in my soul. Can you hear the thunder roar, you better get back. I hear thunder, who's in control. Can you hear the thunder roar. Better get back, Cerebral Man. And the walls are too high to jump. The walls are to high to jump. I hear thunder, it's in my soul. Can you hear the thunder roar, you better get back.

cool zero,"Art attacks from subway walls. Sprayed like bullets into concrete face. Everywhere you turn, knuckles are crackin'. Suburban monkeys break ghetto habits. Body guns loaded for a dime. See `em shed their celebrity skin. For a life of trash and crime. Chorus:. Cool Zero. You wanna know where the wild ones go. Cool Zero. You wanna know where the bodies are burned. Crawlin' under every rock, you gotta see what time forgot. Cool Zero (Cool Zero) Cool Zero. Nothin' stops the hit parade. Money makers will be shaken down. Everywhere you go, fingers are snappin'. Commercial prophets shout revolution. Throwin' dirt upon a good mans name. Watch `em sell his soul for shoes. And dance upon his grave. (Chorus). In this junk food civilization. They will eat and not think twice. For a dance in the dragons jaws. They will gladly pay the price. An' eat their fill - Ooh, Ooh - Hey. Headlines turn in violent days. Run like blood across the printed page. Everywhere you look, atoms are smashin'. Politicians smilin' for the camera. And the pictures make you wanna scream. Maybe baby, we'll just play it cool. Like Elvis at 19. (Chorus). Cool Zero (Cool Zero) Cool Zero ..... From the album ""Wide Awake In Dreamland""."

diamond field,"From the top of the hill. You can see all the lights of the Diamond Field. The treasure buried in plain sight. Where one mans loss is another mans gain. And no one cares about anything, worth caring about. Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight. Tightrope walkin', in the web of light. Shall we go the Diamond Field and try. To seek the fortune in their eyes. One by one the lights go out. And the Diamond Field begins to fade. It turns back into cement and stone. Brick and asphalt, flesh and bone. Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight. Tightrope walkin', in the web of light. Shall we go the Diamond Field and try. To seek the fortune in their eyes. Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight. Tightrope walkin', in the web of light. Electric angles move against the night. Shining in the Diamond Field. From the album ""Tropico""."
dirty little secrets,"It seems I loved you for so long. It seems like all of my life. Just like a child who doesn't belong. You'd turn, 'til even the sun became your shadow. And I hate you in your innocence, you know. But I hate myself even more for lovin' you so. Sometimes I believed, what you had to say. Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away. Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know. Where all our Dirty Little Secrets go. Nobody's perfect, certainly not us. We've all got secrets to keep. I would have kept yours safe in my heart. You would have always known where to find me. And I know you better that I know myself, you know. So why pretend you've got somewhere else to go. Sometimes I believed, what you had to say. Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away. Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know. Where all our Dirty Little Secrets go. Sometimes it hurt so bad that you cry. Then there's the times you wish you had died. Sometimes the truth is worse than the lie, sometimes. Sometimes it's best to lock it away. In a place that's secret and safe. Sometimes you just pretend you don't know. Sometimes it's best to let go. Sometimes I believed, what you had to say. Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away. Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know. Where all our Dirty Little Secrets go."
disconnected,"The hammer lands, the verdict stands. The walls come crumblin' down. The color code, rule of thumb. Shadows on the sun. Can you tell me, where it's really at?. All around the world tonight. People watchin', people waitin'. All around the world tonight. People feelin' - Disconnected. (Somebody better plug me in). The jukebox plays a toxic waltz. A factory belches steam. A sidewalk ends in baby steps &. A widow maker screams. (And it sounds like this). Hear her call your name. All around the world tonight. People watchin', people waitin'. All around the world tonight. People feelin' - Disconnected. The page is turned, a city burned. The whole world falls apart. The plug is pulled, truth escapes. The space between our hearts. Space between our hearts. Space between our hearts. All around the world tonight. From the album ""Gravity's Rainbow""."
don't happen no more,"Well there used to be a time when a man was a king. To work for a man was a woman's only dream. Everything he did was perfectly alright.

girl,"Do you like the way it feels when you get hurt?. Maybe you should take a long hard look at your self-worth. There's an emptiness inside. It started many years ago. You always try to fill it up. It's a familiar place you go. One day you'll just have to wake up, girl. [Chorus]. You know you got a lot to learn. You've got to do it for yourself. Find your own direction, don't rely on someone else. You got to know it in your heart. You've got to build it up with love, it isn't hard to rise above. Wake up, you don't wanna make up. You've got to do it for yourself. I know it feels sometimes that loneliness is worse. And with every change there comes a melancholy search. Now you can walk away from this. It doesn't have to bring you down. Have faith in destiny you what goes around, comes around. You don't have to stay and take it, girl. [Chorus]. Got nowhere to run. Got nowhere to hide. These changes will come if you just open your eyes. Got nowhere to run. Got nowhere to hide. You gotta do it for yourself. You gotta know it in your heart."

have it all,"You think that you're the second coming. Sorry to say it doesn't do it for me. Must be a drag when you're so stunning. In all that you are. And all that you hope to be. [Chorus]. You can have it all, take it all. Break it all, forsake it all. Want it all, choose it all. Use it with no stake at all. Keep it all, trash it all. Lead it just like sheep it all.

hell is for children,"They cry in the dark, so you can't see their tears. They hide in the light, so you can't see their fears. Forgive and forget, all the while. Love and pain become one and the same. In the eyes of a wounded child. Because Hell. Hell Is For Children. And you know that their little lives can become such a mess. Hell. Hell Is For Children. And you shouldn't have to pay for your love with your bones and your flesh. It's all so confusing, this brutal abusing. They blacken your eyes, and then apologize. You're daddy's good girl, and don't tell mommy a thing. Be a good little boy, and you'll get a new toy. Tell grandma you fell off the swing. Because Hell. Hell Is For Children. And you know that their little lives can become such a mess. Hell. Hell Is For Children. And you shouldn't have to pay for your love with your bones and your flesh. No, Hell Is For Children. Hell.

here's my heart,"Our two worlds met in strange surprise. I hid my love in thin disguise. I tried to leave, how could I stay?. What if my heart gave me away?. I always thought I'd be prepared. But love just caught me unaware. You said the words and I believed. I fell so hard, I fell so deep. Love can't hide, though it tries. Hearts catch fire, so has mine. Here's My Heart. So true love triumphs once again. It always makes it in the end. And if you let the heart run free. It will return faithfully. Love can't hide, though it tries. Hearts catch fire, all the time. Helpless love walks the line. Hearts catch fire, the hour is fine. Here's My Heart. Ooh, Ooh. Love can't hide, though it tries. Hearts catch fire, all the time. Helpless love walks the line. Hearts catch fire, so has mine. Here's My Heart. Here's My Heart. Here's My Heart. Here's My Heart. Ooh... Hey, Hey, Hey. From the movie soundtrack ""Metropolis"" (1984).

Am I gone from your thoughts, forgotten somehow. When you be there with her. Does my memory stir, any part of you now. I know that I should concede, face the truth and all that. I know I should realize I'm not a part of your life anymore,. But I can't. I Don't Want To Be Your Friend. I just want to be your lover. I don't think I can pretend. That you mean nothing to me.

if you think you know how to love me,"A breathless drive on a downtown street. Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat. The dust that hung from the desert skies. Run, though we run it still burned our eyes. Oh, yes we can walk on the wild, wild side of life. And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side. And in the shadows of a promise, you can take my hand. And show me the way to understand. Chorus:. So If You Think You Know How To Love Me. And you think you know what I need. And if you really, really want me to stay. You've got to lead the way. Yes, If You Think You Know How To Love Me. And you think you can stand by me. And if you really, really want me to stay. You've got to lead the way. A reckless night in a nameless town. And we moved out of sight, with a silent sound. A beach that wept with deserted waves. That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe. Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me. But there's a lot I can learn, and a lot that I've yet to see. You know you've got my life lying in your hands. It's up to you to make me understand. (Repeat Chorus Twice). So If You Think You Know How To Love Me. And you think you know what I need. And if you really, really want me to stay. You've got to lead the way."
in my dreams,"I have been here in this lonely place. Longer than I care to think or say. Hopin' with a little luck. Maybe I'd find someone like you. I have watched you nearly every morning. Gettin' your coffee, stretchin', yawnin'. Doin' all the little things you do. To start your day. [Chorus 1]. In my dreams I hold your hand. Lay my cheek close to yours. And hold back as long as I can. Feel the sweet sting of your kiss as our lips combine. I know that you've seen me, too. Once you smiled when I looked at you. I wonder if you thought about me. The way I thought of you. Maybe I just make too much of passing glances. Fleeting touches, maybe I'm a dreamer. Maybe so are you. [Chorus 2]. In my dreams I hold you close. Love you the way that I'd hope. Say what you already know. In my dreams I pretend."
in the heat of the night,"In The Heat Of The Night, when you know it ain't right. But you do what you wanna do. You do what you feel, no one can feel like you. Out in the summertime city, ain't it a pity. There's so much to tie you down. You're leaving tonight to somewhere you can't be found. While down at the edge of town. At a pool hall where they all hang around. You hear them talkin' about the girls they knew. And talk about what they're gonna do. Then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?. Is it right, or is it wrong?. Does it matter what's right, In The Heat Of The Night?. Out in the streets tonight, under the neon lights. You're searchin' for something new. But nothin' is real, and no one can feel like you. They say that eagles fly in this red hot sky. But were they just passin' through. Or did they look down, and see what you found was true. But still in the back of your mind. You've got somethin' to believe in, but there's so much to find. As the bright lights dim, and the night closes in. You thought everything is ending, but it's yet to begin. And you ain't seen nothing yet!. But what you see you'll never forget, and you'll say. Why oh Why). Did it take you so long to want something more?. Why oh Why). Did you never get off on this before?. Why oh Why). Well, here it is, the love you've been waitin' for. Why oh Why). Standin' in front of you like an open door. And then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?. Is it right, or is it wrong?. Does it matter what's right, In The Heat Of The Night?. In The Heat Of The Night, when you know it ain't right. But you do what you wanna do. You do what you feel, `cause no one can feel like you."
in these times,"What's the use in staying. when everything's a lie. I hear what you're saying. And it makes me want to cry. You know the truth is so overrated. That should come as no surprise. It's all so complicated. Especially In These Times. Don't it make you crazy. Don't it make you ask yourself why. Nobody's got an answer. Especially In These Times. Life is like a puzzle. Best to chose the edges first. And work back to the middle. To the places where it hurts. Lately I've been thinkin'. Maybe there's a chance for us. If we take it slow now. And don't expect too much. Don't it make you wonder. Don't it make you ask yourself why. Nobody's got an answer. Especially In These Times. And don't it make you crazy. Don't it make you ask yourself why. Nobody's got an answer. Especially In These Times. Ooh, Ooh. (What's the use in stayin', when everything's a lie. And there's nothing sacred, especially In These Times). Hey don't it make you crazy. Don't it make you ask yourself why. Nobody's got an answer. Especially In These Times. And don't it make you wonder. Don't it make you ask yourself why. Nobody's got an answer.

That get harder, and harder, and harder, and harder, and harder. To remove. But we let it continue, like people in love always do. Ooh - Ooh. Ooh - Ooh. Ooh - Ooh. Lets not pretend that we're unique. Coz everybody's tasted loves illusion. We try to hide the fact that we. Got lost between the choas and confusion. And the love we feel.

out of the ruins,"It began as a summer just like the rest. Hopeful and filled with emotion. Lovers enjoying their sweet conquests. Pledging undying devotion. He felt the warm winds encircle his heart;. Softly, gently caressing all of his being. Every part, his love for her was unending. She was all that he dreamed of all of his life. For her there was no other. Happy were they as man and wife. Happy were they that summer. But all that it seemed was not meant to be,. The world was lost in indifference. And what began as a small incident ended up as hell. Then without warning all that they knew. Everything they'd been together was taken away,. Swift and cruel on that terrible night in summer. Out of the ruins he called her name. Echoing over and over. Silently waiting, but no one came. Out of the ruins that summer. But all that it seemed was not meant to be. The world was lost in indifference. And what began as a small incident ended up as hell. Out of the ruins he walked alone. Empty and broken forever. With nothing left but the sweet memory."

papa's roses,"I picked a rose this morning. And it was so fresh, it looked like it was crying. I thought how sad to be so beautiful. Only to wither and die. Like Papa's Roses soft and pale. Like petals thrown in the dirt. Only silence is spoken here. All that grows here is hurt. And Papa's Roses. Papa wasn't really a hardened man. He could be tender at times. I remember, it was like it holiday. When he was gentle and kind. He gave those roses his heart and soul. I wish he'd saved some for me. It would've been such a simple thing,. For me to be, like Papa's Roses. Like Papa's Roses soft and pale. Like petals thrown in the dirt. Only silence is spoken here. All that grows here is hurt. And Papa's Roses. Voices that whisper soft and low. Forever buried inside. Haunted by images dark and cold. Forever burned in your mind. But I dreamed I could fly away. Like an angel I'd fly. To the places where I could forget. Forget that I was like Papa's Roses. Like Papa's Roses soft and pale. Like petals thrown in the dirt. Only silence is spoken here. All that grows here is hurt. And Papa's Roses."

So we took a trip to Paris. Cause you swore that it would scare us out of our swift decline. All that I remember `bout those days in that September. Is the ""merci"" and the wine. Cut it out, drop it, count me out - baby stop it. Life is too short, so why waste Precious Time. Life is too short, so why waste. Precious Time, Precious Time, Precious Time. Oh, Precious Time. Life is too short, so why waste Precious Time. You talk on the telephone, long distance to New York or Rome. Some would say you got it made. Your home is like a fortress, no one comes in but the florist. The gardner, and the maid. You call me on the telephone, you say you feel so alone. Too tired to get dressed and get out. First you're happy, then you're sad. Somehow you always hang up mad. Excuse me if I shout. Cut it out, drop it, count me out - baby stop it. Life is too short, so why waste Precious Time.

prisioner of love,"Cold hard labor, it's a labor of love. Convicted of crimes, the crimes of passion. Caught in a chain gang, the chain of fools. Solitary confinement, confined by the rules. I'm just a Prisoner. An inmate of love. Oh I'm a Prisoner. Captured by love. With no escape. No where to go. No place to hide. Hey, I'm a Prisoner!. I'm just a Prisoner. Mending the wounds, the wounds of lament. The knife cut deep, deep into my heart. The romance is over, my passions remain. Still bound to love by this ball and chain. I'm just a Prisoner. An inmate of love. Oh I'm a Prisoner. Captured by love. With no escape. No where to go. No place to hide. Hey, I'm a Prisoner!. I'm just a Prisoner. Oh I'm a Prisoner. Hey, I'm a Prisoner!. Find an escape, a key to the door. I gotta get out, can't take anymore. Make a clean break, to bury the past. I'll shed these chains and be free at last. I'm just a Prisoner. A Prisoner Of Love.

promises in the dark,"Never again, isn't that what you said?. You've been through this before. An' you swore this time you'd think with your head. No one, would ever have you again. And if takin' was gonna get done. You'd decide where and when. Just when you think you got it down. Your heart securely tied and bound. They whisper, Promises In The Dark. Armed and ready, you fought love battles in the night. But too many opponents made you weary of the fight. Blinded by passion, you foolishly let someone in. All the warnings went off in your head. Still you had to give in. Just when you think you got it down. Resistance nowhere to be found. They whisper, Promises In The Dark. But promises, you know what they're for. It sounds so convincing, but you heard it before. Cause talk is cheap and you gotta be sure. And so you put up your guard. And you try to be hard. But your heart says try again. You desperately search for a way to conquer the fear. No line of attack has been planned to fight back the tears. Where brave and restless dreams are both won and lost. On the edge is where it seems it's well worth the cost. Just when you think you got it down. Your heart in pieces on the ground. They whisper, Promises In The -- Dark."
purgatory,"We will be the forgotten ones. They will shake their heads and pity us. We who sacrificed our sons and daughters. With the sweet taste of victory on our lips.

I am tired and I'm seeking restitution. Oh will you heal me, will you take away my pain. What I'm looking for is absolution. Getting out of Purgatory. Is no small accomplishment. And the price is high. And it comes with its own set of conditions. The choice is never clear and difficult to make. But it will not change them. They will just go on the way they always have.

red vision,"Firewalkers feel no pain from the coals. Ruled by passion beyond their control. Vengeance is king in the zone of Red Vision. Sparks fly and tempers flair. You see the enemy everywhere. Hate shines like burning bridges in your eyes. In love and war we stand alone. Trustin' nothin' but our own, Red Vision. Anger sharpens your point of view. Fans the fire in and around you. Farenheit in the realm of your senses. In love and war we stand alone. Trusting nothing but our own, Red Vision. Mind like a steel trap, heart like a prison. With tears of rage, we burn in our Red Vision. Once again, I'll walk the coals. Tiptoe through the minefields of your soul. I've come to take you home. Red Vision. Red Vision. Red Vision. Red Vision. Oh, Red Vision........ Written by: Neil Geraldo & Myron Grombacher."

He was crazy of course. From the first she must have known it. But still she went on with him. And she never once had shown it. And she took him off the streets. And she dried his tears of grievin'g. She listened to his visions. She believed in his believin'. Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle. And she was the moon shining back his light a little. He was a shooting star. She was softer and more slowly. He could not make things possible. But, she could make them holy, holy.... He was dancin' to some music. No one else had ever heard. He'd speak in unknown languages. She'd translate every word. And when the world was laughing. At his castles in the sky. She'd hold him in her body. And he once again would fly. Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle. And she was the moon shining back his light a little. He was a shooting star. She was softer and more slowly. He could not make things possible. But, she could make them holy, holy.... But she gave him a daughter. And she gave him a son. She was a mother, and a wife,. And a lover when the day was done. Well, he was too far gone for giving love. What he'd offer in its stead. Was the knowledge she was the only thing. That was not in his head. He took off East one morning. In the rising sun's red glow. She knew he was going nowhere. But of course she let him go. As she stood and watched him dwindle. Much too empty to be sad. He reappeared beside her and said,. ""You're all I've ever had"". Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle. And she was the moon shining back his light a little. He was a shooting star. She was softer and more slowly. He could not make things possible. But, she could make them holy.

silent partner,"Background voices calling from a distance. See no evil, hear no evil). Static on the line of least resistance. Don't say nothing at all. Don't say nothing at all. Don't say nothing at all. I'm hanging on a wire, waitin' on the word. I'm never seen, you're never heard. The object of desire is seldom ever clear. I reach for you but all I hear.

You know they don't say nothing at all. What about the things we never mention?. What about the things we never say?. Will we wind up targets of affection?. In silence, turning silent. The silent turn away. A paramour or less, is never really sure. Exactly what to listen for. In secret service to the things they never say. The Silent Partners fade away.

Here you make me bleed again. When I'm already drownin'. And out here where the air is thing. There's just no mercy. Maybe we could try again. Put the past behind us. And we'd be ready to pretend. And say we're sorry. I remember when you loved me. I remember how good it used to feel. Then we let it just slip away. We were dreamers. Pretending it wasn't real. Even if you go I will still remain.

strawberry wine (life is sweet),"How am I supposed to make it through another day. What am I supposed to do now that you've gone away. Is there anything encouraging you can say to me. Did you really think my heart was made of stone. Maybe you never gave it any thought at all. How nice to go through live oblivious and free. Life is sweet, sweet as Strawberry Wine. And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine. And you are that, you are more than sublime. And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience. How am I supposed to ever feel the same. These kind of situations always have a way. Of screwing up your mind and messing with your sanity. How many days and nights will have to come and go. Before I realize what I already know. I'm better off without you like I thought I'd be. Life is sweet, sweet as Strawberry Wine. And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine. And you are that, you are more than sublime. And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience. (Spoken) Life is sweet. Life is sweet, sweet as Strawberry Wine. And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine.

takin' it back,"When they found you, you were driven and hungry. You were playin' for your life then. You were livin' for the chance to be heard. What they promised, what they offered. Was more than you'd ever hoped for. To walk away, ya' know that would've been absurd. And talk about absurdity, it was madness. It was everything in excess.

Tell `em you're Takin' It Back. So they might as well get used to the idea. You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over. You got no one to blame but yourself. So don't put it on nobody else. Put it behind you, start over, today. There were parties and photos and televised award shows. And covers of magazines. There was gold and platinum and everyone was smiling. You were coming apart at the seems. There were jerk offs too numerous to mention. When everybody shared the dream. But when it came time to share the nightmare. They were conveniently nowhere to be seen. (Chorus). Oh they'll argue what they gave you was exactly what you wanted. And just to be fair, ya' know that some of it's true. That's why ya' gotta be careful, `bout your wishes. Take your time and think `em over. Sometimes those wishes just might come true. Tell `em you're Takin' It Back. So they might as well get used to the idea. You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over. Tell `em you've had enough, and if they don't like it it's tough.

Like verses whispered in some ancient ritual. That accusations fly, but we are no closer to the truth. [Instrumental]."

the effect you have on me,"There are people who have no trouble. In expressing what they feel. For me it's never been that bad. It's just the way I've always been. I often try to tell my friends. About the effect you have on me. I don't know why. I can't explain. When you are near. My heart is weak. It spins around my head and then. Recalls your fingers down my spine. It goes away, comes back again. Makes me cry, it makes me shy. You have in your hands, my light of love. And in your eyes, all that I've missed. What more could I expect from life. Than your loving and tender kiss. And they can talk about paradise. And all the dreams that are to be. I laugh and doubt it could compare. To the effect you have on me. There are no words, no reasons why. The tears that sometimes fill my eyes. They're only tears of happiness. It's only fear of losing you. I often try to tell my friends. About this effect you have on me. I don't know why. I can't explain. When you are near my heart is weak. It spins around my head and then. Recalls your fingers down my spine. It goes away, comes back again. Makes me cry, it makes me shy. Only your voice can bring me peace. Only your touch can bring me joy. What more should I expect from this life. When so many people. Still search for love. I know I never will explain. This effect you have on me. But if I have on you the same. We'll be in love"

the outlaw blues,"It was rainin' in heaven when you went down. You were better than the best. Stayed a notch above the rest. It was rainin' in heaven when you went down. Your mother cried, said she told you so. But you touched the devil and couldn't let go. (Yeah). No one controls the Outlaw. You wrote the story with the movie in mind. An angel face with a criminal side. Celebraed as the rebel kind. The Outlaw. I wonder if you knew. They would turn your bad deeds into good. Paint you as a modern robinhood. It's high noon. Everywhere you go. And the guilt you feel is the weary soul. (Yeah). Of the Outlaw. Hearts weren't made to be ruled. And rules weren't made to be broken. It's cold and lonely at the end of your life. And nobody sleeps `til they turn out the lights. For the Outlaw. Where you gonna go, where you gonna hide. It's cold and lonely for the Outlaw. Where you gonna go, where you gonna hide. As the Outlaw. From the album ""Tropico""."
the victim,"You've been set up one too many times. The perfect victim for the perfect crime. You left yourself wide open to the pain. So close your eyes now. You're out walkin' in the rain. You've got a burning desire to be The Victim. You're bleeding from the soul. You're hurting from the heart. Things you can't be told are gonna tear you apart. Your choice of lovers, never very bright. Your father worried, but even he gave up the fight. You always think their hearts are made of gold. And you're the savior, to coax the warmth out of the cold. You've got a burning desire to be The Victim. You're bleeding from the soul. You're hurting from the heart. Things you can't be told are gonna tear you apart. Cause you're The Victim. Break the pattern, you've gotta break away. Break the pattern before it gets too late. You've got a burning desire to be The Victim. You're bleeding from the soul. You're hurting from the heart. Things you're never told are gonna tear you apart. Cause you're The Victim."
ties that bind,"Anger shakes the house of cards. Loving cup upon the bars. We bend the truth to help us through the night. Tempers thrown against the wall. Shattered like an empty glass. Nothin' can save us from our own selves tonight. Anger is a might sword. Vengeance is our own reward. Love goes bling one eye at a time. Gonna cut away from the ties that bind. Hey, Hey. There's an edge within my voice. Helps me win when I should lose. We pick and choose our weapons carefully. Words are twisted like a fist. Behind our backs no slight of hand. No battle ever ended in a kiss. Anger is a might sword. Vengeance is our own reward. Love goes bling one eye at a time. Gonna cut away from the ties that bind. Hey, Hey. Anger shakes the house of cards. Loving cup upon the bars. We bend the truth to help us through the night. Anger is a might sword. Vengeance is our own reward. Love goes bling one eye at a time. Gonna cut away from the ties that bind. From the album ""Gravity's Rainbow""."
too long a soldier,"We were the children of `45. Loaded like pistols and taught how to die. We looked the enemy straight in the eye (And never surrender). Through trenches dug in the back of my mind. I go over the top time after time. Me and the ones we left behind (Faces I'll always remember). Now there's no fight left within me, but the writing of this wrong. As nations we're divided, but as people we are one. Like brothers in blood it seems that we've been -Too Long A Soldier. In the city of monuments, among the flags of all governments. The order of battle is written in the shadows of a hard black line. Where people cry for a nations scars. And heros sleep beneath a blanket of stars. Too young to die, but never too old to play the general's game. Now there's no life left within them, but the memory lingers on. As nations we're divided, but as people we are one. For brothers in blood we sing that we've been -Too Long A Soldier. Eternal flames blow in the wind, I've been Too Long A Soldier. Captain of the guard I'm coming in, Too Long, Too Long A Soldier. I've seen so much worth dying for, so little worth killing over. Hey, Hey. Eternal flames blow in the wind, I've been Too Long A Soldier. Captain of the guard I'm coming in, Too Long, Too Long A Soldier. I've seen so much worth dying for, so little worth killing over. Soldiers gone before me, I will surely fade away. My eyes have seen the glory, and the suffering and the pain. I've been Too Long A Soldier, Too Long, Too Long A Soldier. I've been Too Long A Soldier. Too Long A Soldier).

Never see the light 'til your - Tradin' Down. Work hard labor for your daily bread. While the golden dream spins around your head. Time gets money. money buys you time. For the foolish things that you left behind. Workin', workin' overtime. And Tradin' Down. It's gonna be alright, he said. It's gonna be alright. There's nothing that's here for us. That we won't mind missin'. Never see the light 'til your - Tradin' Down. There's no future for the workin' man. See him growin' old in the promised land. Nothin' to show for the wasted years.

true love,"Never been no fragile flower. I always got too much to say. Never had much luck with love and romance. I guess it's always been that way. But I've been seriously thinking. About slippin' on the velvet gloves. I know it's strange but my lucks about to change. Cause what we got here is True love, yeh, yeh. True Love, you can't buy it - no, no. You know it ain't like nothin' else. True Love, you really ought to try it. You owe it to yourself to get ya some - True Love. You know I wake up every morning. It's the first thing on my mind. This is a permanent condition, of the most serious kind. Now let me tell you baby. That you were sent from up above. Give me a sign - let's not waste any more time. Cause what we got here is True love, yeh, yeh. I called the man at the video store and I said. Cancel my membership, I won't be needing it no more. Found something else to occupy my nights. And baby it's just the right. Amount of True Love. I called the man at the video store and I said. Cancel my membership, I won't be needing it no more. Found something else to occupy my nights.

walking in the underground,"Cold sweat, sweat it out in the land of the midnight sun. Walk it off - sort it out, figure out what you're running from. I'm all alone on the outside of town. It's a wild night at the carnival of souls. They're strong armed in neon and out of control. It's late at night and no one's around. Walking In The Underground. Night calls, and the sound marks the start of the masquerade. Sirens flash, stains the glass as you pass in the street parade. Loose change losers are double parked. Faces marked like cards at the bottom of the deck. Readin' the future no one expects. They don't look up as they shuffle down. Walking In The Underground. Walking In The Underground. Walking In The Underground. Cold sweat, sweat it out in the land of the midnight sun. Walk it off - sort it out, figure out what you're running from. Nobody's children, more lost than found. Play in the shadows like beautiful dolls. Backlit in moonlight, steppin' on stars. A silent dance to an empty sound. Walking In The Underground. Walking In The Underground. Ooh, Walking In The Underground. Yeah walkin' Ooh, Ooh, Ooh,. Walk On. Ooh, Ooh.......... Yeah, Yeah........ Written by: Neil Geraldo & Myron Grombacher"
we belong,"Many times I've tried to tell you. Many times I've cried alone. Always I'm surprised how well you. Cut my feelings to the bone. Don't want to leave you really. I've invested too much time. To give you up that easy. To the doubts that complicate your mind. Chorus:. We Belong to the light. We Belong to the thunder. We Belong to the sound of the words. We've both fallen under. Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We Belong, We Belong. We Belong together. Maybe it's a sign of weakness. When I don't know what to say. Maybe I just wouldn't know. What to do with my strength anyway. Have we become a habit. Do we distort the facts. Now there's no looking forward. Now there's no turning back. When you say. (Chorus). Close your eyes and try to sleep now. Close your eyes and try to dream. Clear your mind and do your best. To try and wash the palette clean. We can't begin to know it. How much we really care. I hear your voice inside me. I see your face everywhere. Still you say. (Chorus). ."
we live for love,"Your love's contagious, one kiss is dangerous. But I have more to risk, than you to lose. I feel passion growing. I know that love is only just one inch away, from striking us. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. When we get tired, and watch the summer fade away. Will you think of romance, what will we do?. Is there a place where we can go?. Where time stands still for those who know?. Till eternity we'll fulfill our desires. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. I never planned to win the race. But you convinced me face to face. There was never a chance of losing at all. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. We Live For Love. We Live For Love (Fading)."
wide awake in dreamland,"Movin' light, dream machinery. Crashin' in, through my balcony - oh no. I shout down the line but could not get through. Cause the telephone never rings when you want it to. Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland. Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland. Words of love take your breath away. Just a game that you like to play - oh no. Sleepwalking through a world of pain. Just another pretty face, in the romeo rain. Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland. Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland. Chemical decisions never turn out like you planned. Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland. Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland. You know your paint by number life does not excite you. It's a watercolor world that you're livin' in. And when you close your eyes at night. You're wonderin', just where you've been. You were young when you heard the call. Saw it all in your crystal ball and chains. A problem child who can pick and choose. When the sandman calls your name, you cannot refuse. Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland - Ooh. Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland. Chemical decisions never turn out like you planned. Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland. In Dreamland. In Dreamland.
