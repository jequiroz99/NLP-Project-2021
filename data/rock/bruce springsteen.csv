This gun's for hire. Even if we're just dancing in the dark. You sit around getting older. There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me. I'll shake this world off my shoulder. Come on baby the laugh's on me. Stay on the streets of this town. And they'll be carving you up all right. They say you gotta stay hungry. Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight. I'm dying for some action. I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write. This book. I need a love reaction. Come on now baby gimme just one look. You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying. Over a broken heart. This gun's for hire. Even if we're just dancing in the dark. You can't start a fire worrying about. Your little world falling apart. This gun's for hire. Even if we're just dancing in the dark. Even if we're just dancing in the dark"
born in the u.s.a.,"Born down in a dead man's town. The first kick I took was when I hit the ground. You end up like a dog that's been beat too much. Till you spend half your life just covering up. Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.. I was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.. Got in a little hometown jam. So they put a rifle in my hand. Sent me off to a foreign land. To go and kill the yellow man. Born in the U.S..A..... Come back home to the refinery. Hiring man said ""Son if it was up to me"". Went down to see my V.A. man. He said ""Son, don't you understand"". I had a brother at Khe Sahn. Fighting off the Viet Cong. They're still there, he's all gone. He had a woman he loved in Saigon. I got a picture of him in her arms now. Down in the shadow of the penitentiary. Out by the gas fires of the refinery. I'm ten years burning down the road. Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go. Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.. Born in the U.S.A., I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A.. Born in the U.S.A., Born in the U.S.A..

streets of philadelphia,"I was bruised and battered. And I couldn't tell what I felt. I was unrecognizable to myself. I saw my reflection in a window. I didn't know my own face oh brother. Are you gonna leave me wastin' away. On the streets of Philadelphia. I walked the avenue till my legs felt like stone. I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone. At night I could hear the blood in my veins. Just as black and whispery as the rain. On the streets of Philadelphia. Ain't no angel gonna greet me. It's just you and I my friend. My clothes don't fit me no more. I walked a thousand miles. Just to slip the skin. The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake. I can feel myself fadin' away. So receive me brother with your faithless kiss. Or will we leave each other alone like this. On the streets of Philadelphia?"
i'm on fire,Hey little girl is your daddy home. Did he go away and leave you all alone. I got a bad desire. I'm on fire. Tell me now baby is he good to you. Can he do to you the things that I do. I can take you higher. I'm on fire. Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby. edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley. through the middle of my soul. At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet. and a freight train running through the. middle of my head. Only you can cool my desire. I'm on fire.
glory days,"I had a friend was a big baseball player. Back in high school. He could throw that speedball by you. Make you look like a fool boy. Saw him the other night at this roadside. Bar i was walking in. And he was walking out. We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks. But all he kept talking about was. Glory days well they´ll pass you by. Glory days in the wink of a young girl´s eye. Glory days, glory days. There's a girl that lives up the block back. In school. She could turn all the boys´heads. Sometimes on a friday i´ll stop by and have. A few drinks. After she put her kids to bed. Her and her husband bobby well they split up. I guess it´s two years gone by now. We just sit around talking about the old times. She says when she feels like crying. She starts laughing thinking about.. Glory days.... Think i´m going down to the well tonight. And I'm going to drink till i get my fill. And I hope when i get old. I don't sit around thinking about it. But i probably will. . Yeah just sitting back trying to recapture. A little of the glory of,. But time slips away and leaves you. With nothing mister but boring stories of. Glory days..."
born to run,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets. Of a runaway American dream. At night we ride through mansions of glory. In suicide machines. Sprung from cages on Highway 9. Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected. And steppin' out over the line. Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back. It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap. We gotta get out while we're young. 'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run. Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend. I wanna guard your dreams and visions. Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims. And strap your hands 'cross my engines. Together we could break this trap. We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back. Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire. 'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider. But I gotta know how it feels. I wanna know if your love is wild. Baby, I wanna know if love is real. Beyond the place hemi-powered drones. Scream down the boulevard. Girls comb their hair in rear view mirrors. And the boys try to look so hard. The amusement park rises bold and stark. And kids are huddled on the beach in the mist. I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight. In an everlasting kiss. One, two, three, four. Highway's jammed with broken heroes. On a last-chance power drive. Everybody's out on the road tonight but. There's no place left to hide. Together Wendy we can live with the sadness. I'll love you with all the madness in my soul. Oh, someday girl I don't know when. We're gonna get to that place where really wanna go. And we'll walk in the sun. But till then tramps like us, baby we were born to run. Tramps like us, baby we were born to run. Come on Wendy, tramps like us. Baby we were born to run. Whoa, ooh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa."
the river,"I come from down in the valley. Where mister, when you're young. They bring you up to do like your daddy done. Me and Mary we met in high school. When she was just seventeen. We'd drive out of this valley. down to where the fields were green. We'd go down to the river. And into the river we'd dive. Oh down to the river we'd ride. Then I got Mary pregnant. And, man, that was all she wrote. And for my 19th birthday. I got a union card and a wedding coat. We went down to the courthouse. And the judge put it all to rest. No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle. No flowers, no wedding dress. That night we went down to the river. And into the river we'd dive. Oh down to the river we did ride. I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company. But lately there ain't been much work. on account of the economy. Now all them things that seemed so important. Well mister they vanished right into the air. Now I just act like I don't remember. Mary acts like she don't care. But I remember us riding in my brother's car. Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir. At night on them banks I'd lie awake. And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take. Now those memories come back to haunt me. They haunt me like a curse. Is a dream a lie if it don't come true. Or is it something worse. that sends me down to the river. though I know the river is dry. That sends me down to the river tonight. Down to the river. My baby and I. Oh down to the river we ride"
secret garden,"She'll let you in her house. If you come knockin' late at night. She'll let you in her mouth. If the words you say are right. If you pay the price. She'll let you deep inside. But there's a secret garden she hides. She'll let you in her car. To go drivin' 'round. She'll let you into the parts of herself. That'll bring you down. She'll let you in her heart. If you got a hammer and a vise. But into her secret garden, don't think twice. You've gone a million miles. How far'd you get. To that place where you can't remember. And you can't forget. She'll lead you down a path. There'll be tenderness in the air. She'll let you come just far enough. So you know she's really there. She'll look at you and smile. And her eyes will say. She's got a secret garden. Where everything you want. Where everything you need. Will always stay. A million miles away"
my hometown,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand. Into the bus stop. To pick up a paper for my old man. I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and. Steer as we drove through town. He'd tousle my hari and say son take a. good look around this is your hometown. This is your hometown. This is your hometown. This is your hometown. In '65 tension was running high, at my high school. There was a lot of fights between the black and white. There was nothing you could do. Two cars at light on a Saturday night,. In the back seat there wasa gun. Words were passed, in a shotgun blast. Troubled times had come, to my hometown. My hometown. My hometown. My hometown. Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores. Seems like there ain't nobody. Wants to come down here no more. They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks. Foreman says these jobs are going boys. And they ain't coming back to your hometown. Your hometown. Your hometown. Your hometown. Last night me and Kate we laid in bed talking about getting out. Packing up our bags and maybe heading south. I'm 35, we got a boy of our own now. Last night I sat him up, behind the wheel. And said son take a goold look around,. This is your hometown."
tougher than the rest,Well It's Saturday night. you're all dressed up in blue. I been watching you awhile. maybe you been watching me too. So somebody ran out. left somebody's heart in a mess. Well if you're looking for love. honey I'm tougher than the rest. Some girls they want a handsome Dan. or some good-lookin' Joe on their arm. Some girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo.

my father's house,"Last night I dreamed that I was a child. Out where the pines grow wild and tall. I was trying to make it home through the forest. Before the darkness falls. I heard the wind rustling through the trees. And ghostly voices rose from the fields. I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path. With the devil snappin' at my heels. I broke through the trees, and there in the night. My father's house stood shining hard and bright. The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms. But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms. I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart. Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts. I got dressed, and to that house I did ride. From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light. I walked up the steps and stood on the porch. A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door. I told her my story, and who I'd come for. She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"". My father's house shines hard and bright. It stands like a beacon calling me in the night. Calling and calling, so cold and alone. Shining `cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned."
growin' up,I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade. I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade. I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch. I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Sit down' I stood up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing. I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could. sing. I pushed B-52 and bombed `em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on. standing. I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to. landing. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Come down' I threw. up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard. to hold your breath. I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared. I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress. Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little. place in the stars. I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said`Sit down'I stood up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. Ooh-ooh growin' up.

human touch,"You and me we were the pretenders. We let it all slip away. In the end what you don't surrender. Well the world just strips away. Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers. Ain't gonna find no miracles here. Well you can wait on your blesses my darling. I got a deal for you right here. I ain't looking for praise or pity. I ain't coming 'round searching for a crutch. I just want someone to talk to. And a little of that Human Touch. Just a little of that Human Touch. Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town. Ain't no bread from Heavenly skies. Ain't nobody drawing wine from this blood. It's just you and me tonight. Tell me, in a world without pity. Do you think what I'm askin's too much. I just want something to hold on to. And a little of that Human Touch. Just a little of that Human Touch. Oh girl that feeling of safety that you prize. Well it comes at a hard hard price. You can't shut off the risk and the pain. Without losing the love that remains. We're all riders on this train. So you've been broken and you've been hurt. Show me somebody who ain't. Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain. But, hell, a little touch up and a little paint.... You might need something to hold on to. When all the answers, they don't amount to much. Somebody that you could just to talk to. And a little of that Human Touch. Baby, in a world without pity. Do you think what I'm askin's too much. I just want to feel you in my arms. Share a little of that Human Touch. Feel a little of that Human Touch. Give me a little of that Human Touch."
no surrender,We busted out of class had to get away from those fools. We learned more from a three-minute record. That we ever learned in school. Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound. I can feel my heart begin to pound. You say you're tired and you just want to close. Your eyes and follow your dreams down. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrender. Now young faces grow sad and old and hearts. of fire grow cold. We swore blood brothers against the wind. I'm ready to grow young again. And hear yur sister's voice calling us home. Acroos the open yards. Believin' we could cut someplace of our own. With these drums and these guitars. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrender. Blood brother in the stormy night with a vow to defend. No retreat no surrender. Now on the street tonight the lights gro dim. The walls of my room are closing in. But it's good to see your smiling face. And to hear your voice again. We could sleep in the twilight. By the river bed. With a wide open country in our hearts. And these romantic dreams in our heads. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrende

The way I feel when I'm in your hands. Take me now as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. They can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. What I got I have earned. What I'm not I have learned. Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe.

fire,"I'm driving in my car, I turn on the radio. I'm pulling you close, you just say no. You say you don't like it, but girl I know youre a liar. `cause when we kiss, fire. Late at night I'm takin you home. I say I wanna stay, you say you wanna be alone. You say you don't love me, girl you cant hide your desire. `cause when we kiss, fire. You had a hold on me, right from the start. A grip so tight I couldnt tear it apart. My nerves all jumpin actin like a fool. Well your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool. Romeo and juliet, samson and delilah. Baby you can bet their love they didn't deny. Your words say split but your words they lie. `cause when we kiss, fire"
thunder road,"The screendoor slams, Mary's dress waves. Like a vision she dances across the porch. As the radio plays. Roy Orbison singin' for the lonely. Hey that's me and I want you only. Don't turn me home again I just can't face myself alone again. Don't run back inside, darlin' you know just what I'm here for. So you're scared and you're thinkin' that maybe we ain't that young anymore. Show a little faith, there's magic in the night. You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're all right. Oh, and that's all right with me. You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain. Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain. Waste your summer prayin' in vain for a savior to ride from these streets. Well now I'm no hero, that's understood. All the redemption I can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood. With a chance to make it good somehow. Hey what else could we do now. Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair. Well the night's bustin' open, these two lanes will take us anywhere. We got one last chance to make it real. To trade in these wings on some wheels. Climb in back heaven's waitin' down on the tracks. Oh, oh come take my hand. We're ridin' out tonight to case the promised land. Oh, oh thunder road. Oh, thunder road. Oh, thunder road. Lyin' out there like a killer in the sun. Hey I know it's late, we can make it if we run. Oh, oh thunder road. Sit tight, take hold. Thunder road. Well I got this guitar and I've learned how to make it talk. And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk. From the front porch to my front seat. The door's open but the ride ain't free. And I know you're hungry for words that I ain't spoke. But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken. There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away. They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets. They scream your name at night in the streets. Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet. And in the lonely cool before dawn. You hear their engines roarin' on. But when you get to the front porch, they're gone. On the wind. So Mary climb in. It's a town full of losers. And I'm pullin' outta here to win."
hungry heart,"Got a wife and kids in baltimore, jack. I went out for a ride and I never went back. Like a river that don't know where it's flowing. I took a wrong turn and I just kept going. Everybody's got a hungry heart. Everybody's got a hungry heart. Lay down your money and you play your part. Everybody's got a hungry heart. I met her in a kingstown bar. We fell in love I knew it had to end. We took what we had and we ripped it apart. Now here I am down in kingstown again. Everybody's got a hungry. Everybody needs a place to rest. Everybody wants to have a home. Don't make no difference what nobody says. Ain't nobody like to be alone. Everybody's got a hungry heart"
the rising,"Can't see nothin' in front of me. Can't see nothin' coming up behind. I make my way through this darkness. I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me. Lost track of how far I've gone. How far I've gone, how high I've climbed. On my back's a sixty pound stone. On my shoulder a half mile line. Come on up for the rising. Com on up, lay your hands in mine. Come on up for the rising. Come on up for the rising tonight. Left the house this morning. Bells ringing filled the air. Wearin' the cross of my calling. On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here. Come on up for the rising. Come on up, lay your hands in mine. Come on up for the rising. Come on up for the rising tonight. Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li. Spirits above and behind me. Faces gone, black eyes burnin' bright. May their precious blood forever bind me. Lord as I stand before your fiery light. Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li. I see you Mary in the garden. In the garden of a thousand sighs. There's holy pictures of our children. Dancin' in a sky filled with light. May I feel your arms around me. May I feel your blood mix with mine. A dream of life comes to me. Like a catfish dancin' on the end of the line. Sky of blackness and sorrow ( a dream of life). Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life). Sky of glory and sadness ( a dream of life). Sky of mercy, sky of fear ( a dream of life). Sky of memory and shadow ( a dream of life). Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight. Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life). Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life ( a dream of life). Come on up for the rising. Come on up, lay your hands in mine. Come on up for the rising. Come on up for the rising tonight. Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li."

We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night. We come home early burning, burning in some fire fight. I'm sick and tired of you setting me up. Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down. I pull you close but when we kiss I can feel a doubt. I remember back when we started. My kisses used to turn you inside out. I used to drive you to work in the morning. Friday night I'd drive you all around. You used to love to drive me wild. But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down."
30 days out,"We fell in love and I made you the world. I spent all my time tryin' to satisfy you, girl. Just one thing that I can't figure out [?]. Closer I get, farther baby I am out [?]. 30 days, 30 days out. Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out. 30 days, 30 days out. With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt. The roof was leakin' honey where we live. And I'm wonderin' what's that something that you won't give. I started loving you but I gotta stop. You got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop. 30 days, 30 days out. You keep me six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out. 30 days, 30 days out. With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt. Tried to talk about what's goin' on. You just smile and tell me ""Baby there ain't nothin' wrong"". In your smile there's a sign in red. It said ""Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead"". 30 days, 30 days out. Yeah I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out. 30 days, 30 days out. With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt. 30 days, 30 days out. Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out. 30 days, 30 days out. With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt."
"4th of july, asbury park (sandy)","Sandy the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight. Forcin' a light into all those stoned-out faces left stranded. on this Fourth of July. Down in town the circuit's full with switchblade lovers so fast. so shiny so sharp. And the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark. And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin. lovers along the shore. Chasin' all them silly New York girls. Sandy the aurora is risin' behind us, the pier lights our carnival. life forever. Love me tonight for I may never see you again, hey Sandy girl. Now the greasers they tramp the streets or get busted for trying to. sleep on the beach all night. Them boys in their spiked high heels ah Sandy their skins are so white. And me I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades bangin' them. pleasure machines. Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise. to unsnap their jeans. And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the south beach drag. I got on it last night and my shirt got caught. And that Joey kept me spinnin' I didn't think I'd ever get off. Oh Sandy the aurora is risin' behind us. The pier lights our carnival life on the water. Runnin' down the beach at night with my boss's daughter. Well he ain't my boss no more Sandy. Sandy the angels have lost their desire for us. I spoke to `em just last night and they said they won't set. themselves on fire for us anymore. Every summer when the weather gets hot they ride that road down from. heaven on their Harleys they come and they go. And you can see `em dressed like stars in all the cheap little seashore. bars parked making love with their babies out on the Kokomo. Well the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better. than they do. This boardwalk life for me is through. You know you ought to quit this scene too. Sandy the aurora's rising behind us, the pier lights our. carnival life forever. Oh love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever."
57 channels (and nothin' on),"I bought a bourgeois house in the Hollywood hills. With a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills. Man came by to hook up my cable TV. We settled in for the night my baby and me. We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past dawn. There was fifty-seven channels and nothin' on. Well now home entertainment was my baby's wish. So I hopped into town for a satellite dish. I tied it to the top of my Japanese car. I came home and I pointed it out into the stars. A message came back from the great beyond. There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on. Well we might'a made some friends with some billionaires. We might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs. All I got was a note that said ""Bye-bye John. Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on"". So I bought a .44 magnum it was solid steel cast. And in the blessed name of Elvis well I just let it blast. 'Til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet. And they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace. Judge said ""What you got in your defense son?"". ""Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on"". I can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone. Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on...."
a good man is hard to find,"It's cloudy out in Pittsburgh. It's rainin' in Saigon. Snow's fallin' all across the Michigan line. Well she sits by the light of her Christmas tree. With the radio softly on. Thinkin' how a good man is so hard to find. Well once she had a fella. Once she was somebody's girl. And she gave all she had that one last time. Now there's a little girl asleep in the back room. She's gonna have to tell about the meanness in this world. And how a good man is so hard to find. Well there's pictures on the table by her bed. Him in his dress greens and her in her wedding white. She remembers how the world was the day he left. And now how that world is dead. And a good man is so hard to find. She got no time now for Casanovas. Yeah those days are gone. She don't want that anymore, she's made up her mind. Just somebody to hold her. As the night gets on. When a good man is so hard to find. Well she shuts off the TV. And without a word. Into bed she climbs. Well she thinks how it was all so wasted. And how expendable their dreams all were. When a good man was so hard to find. Well it's cloudy out in Pittsburgh"

across the border,Tonight my bag is packed. Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks. That will lead me across the border. Tomorrow my love and I Will sleep 'neath auburn skies. Somewhere across the border. We'll leave behind my dear. The pain and sadness we found here. And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy water. Where the sky grows grey and wide. We'll meet on the other side. There across the border. For you I'll build a house. High upon a grassy hill. Somewhere across the border. Where pain and memory. Pain and memory have been stilled. There across the border. And sweet blossoms fill the air. Pastures of gold and green. Roll down into cool clear waters. And in your arms 'neath open skies. I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes. There across the border. Tonight we'll sing the songs. I'll dream of you my coraz_n. And tomorrow my heart will be strong. And may the saints' blessing and grace. Carry me safely into your arms. There across the border. For what are we. Without hope in our hearts. That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters. And eat the fruit from the vine. I know love and fortune will be mine. Somewhere across the border.
action in the streets,"Well don't move. Why don't you listen to what I'm saying. And hey you. You better get up if you plan to be staying. Get loose. You got to listen to what the band is playing.

adam raised a cain,In the summer that I was baptized my father held me to his side. As they put me to the water he said how on that day I cried. We were prisoners of love a love in chains. He was standin' in the door I was standin' in the rain. With the same hot blood burning in our veins. Adam raised a Cain. All of the old faces ask you why you're back. They fit you with position and the keys to your daddy's Cadillac. In the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name. You remember the faces the places the names. You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain. Adam raised a Cain. In the Bible Cain slew Abel and East of Eden he was cast. You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past. Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain. Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame. You inherit the sins you inherit the flames. Adam raised a Cain. Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream. Adam raised a Cain.
after the thunder,"An echo fades of sounds once heard. By thousands brought together for. His ringing voice, a soul that stirred. The faithful to a mighty roar.. For twenty years upon the stage. For twenty years upon the stage. The passion deep within his soul. Brought forth the anger and the rage. His vision locked upon one goal.. The promises of rock and roll could. Break the chains upon his life,. Guitar in hand he vowed he would. Be free from pain and inner strife.. He shook the rafters in the halls. And brought the faithful to their feet,. His river coursed through mighty walls. Across this land, down every street.. With flag unfurled he took the word. Across the seas to hungry youth. Who raised their hands when e'er they heard. His cries for faith, and hope, and truth.. Today he stands with inner peace. A man content with home and health,. Upon his brow a jagged crease. A symbol of success and wealth.. The thunder of his younger days. Has passed, and now his words reveal. A calmer soul in many ways. Fulfilled with satisfactions real.. His arms upraised against the light. He stands alone, his eyes look toward. The ground below, a bird in flight. Still searching for his true reward.. His mission done, he finds retreat. With children and a loving wife,. His body tired from the heat. The price he pays for touring life.. But deep within the longings stir. The music runs within him still,. His passions for the times that were. Are stronger than his iron will.. And all of us who know the man. Will come together when he cries. The message we all understand. The thunder in us never dies.."
ain't good enough for you,"Well you don't like, don't like the way I walk. And you don't like, don't like the way I talk. You criticize about me endlessly. Logic defies how you get stuck with me.

Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa). I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling). Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true. Ain't good enough for you. Hey! Hey! Hey!.

American beauty will you be mine. Out on this highway counting white lines. I remember last summer drifting through our eyes. We're in the high grass, my finger in your hemline. Boot heels click clacking, honey, when you shine. All them blue skies. American beauty wherever you'd sigh. Out on this highway counting white lines. Your hand cups your breast pledging your time. The things we carried, shining skylines. Falling sparrow, sky torn apart. Dark shining arrow, your kiss pierces my heart. American beauty forever mine. Out on this highway counting white lines"

He said: You can try Linda Lee,. Around the corner and across the sea. Oh word is out word is out she's fast. Oh blow me down Linda 'cause I'm sinkin' fast. Yes and them cats are sure getting fat. down in the train yard. And the sandman brings them dreams. to ship out in boxcars. The union says hold, break out the dice, break out the gold. It's lunchtime at last. And old Big Mama said: ""Georges Raft's tonight on the late show"". She sits straddlin' a kitchen chair, really gung-ho. She shivers with chills, wet with her slot-card thrills. Hypnotically lost in the glass. And we all sigh with the sunrise. As we watch the credits pass. And the little blue dot went away. And then the morning cloak fell down. like a hoax over Sleepytown. Them garbage truck vigilantes out making their last rounds. The inheritor he sipped his beer. And poked fun at the queer. And threatened to kick his ass. And the bell rings, a horn blows. And he's outside pumpin' gas. But the things were movin' so slow tonight. So the kid goes back inside the station. And turns on his radio to his local AM station. And then the band played. Right on the radio, it was alright. And the boys in the band sung. And the band played, everybody."
angelyne,"(cover: Gary U.S. Bonds. Written by Springsteen). He was a bouncer in a joint called Tony's Body Shop. She was a night cashier down at the Stop 'n' Shop. He was kinda good-lookin'. And she was kinda fun. They met 'neath that big oak tree. Out where the river runs. Little Angelyne, little Angelyne. As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines. Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined. Just Big Bill and little Angelyne. She was just in from Texas, didn't know her way around. So he took her to a roadhouse on the edge of town. In the beerhall light she looked so fine. And so he popped the question that was on his mind. It was a simple affair, only a friend or two. Preacher asked if they did, they said they do. She bought two tickets with her Daddy's American Express. And hopped a greyhound bus in her wedding dress. Little Angelyne, little Angelyne. As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines. Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined. Just Big Bill and little Angelyne. In a six dollar motel with the honey bun. With seven glorious days in the Nevada sun. He played the tables, she pumped the slots full of dimes. They came back broke but they had a good time. Now many fell apart in the years come and gone. But Big Bill and little Angel they'd last on and on. They held together when the times grew thin. A little boy that looked like her, and a girl that looked like him. So mister don't you pay it no mind. Let the sun go down and the moonlight shine. Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined. Just Big Bill and little Angelyne. Little Angelyne, little Angelyne. As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines. Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined. Just Big Bill and little Angelyne. Little Angelyne, little Angelyne. As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines. Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined. Just Big Bill and little Angelyne."
arabian nights,"Shrieks of Sheiks as they run across the movie screen. A thousand sand-dune soldiers led by an Arabian Queen. And the harem girls move like fancy (Clancy's) dancers. In my dirty dreams. And I wake up on the floor clutching the bed-lamp. And Mama comes in, she screams. ""Hey you been out with that tramp again last night. You know that silver-sequined Arab black bitch. The one that Mama don't like ?"". But Mama she sings me moontime melodies. With this great Top 40 hook. She shrugs her shoulders, she don't care. Papa just stares and says ""Mary, look the girl's alright. The girl's alright"". And there's a tenseness in the air He turns and says. Don't you know, can't you feel it ""Tell me son, what's the word ?"". Because there's something hanging there 'Cos you know he can't hear it. Pull back the mist and reveal it But don't go near it. And even if you fear what you near It's criticized as too absurd. Don't conceal it Even the animals fear it. 'Cos if what Mama feels is too real Papa says ""Fetch me my flashlight,. son"". She just claims she don't feel it And she stumbles out the front door. So come out from behind your bunkers. 'Cos the lift-off's been a bust. Oh Papa's Gone and Mama's dead. And buried in my rocket dust. You're alone now for the first time. Don't worry, 'cos that's all right. All fear will completely disappear. Come the Arabian Night. Well the soundman smiles and turns the dials. To set the meter readin' rising. He pulls the singer's voice from out of his pocket. To see if the audience likes it. Oh and in the very first row sits sweet Jenny Rue. With a bell on her shoe and she wants him to make it. He flicks a switch but Jenny moves too fast. And the audience sways to the sound of her shotgun blast. The manager comes running out from behind stage and says. Check the band's arms for bullet holes. Make that man roll up his sleeves"". The drummer shoots himself with cyanide. And then asks to be relieved. And me, I say ""Well, it's too crazy in here. Which is the stage door out, I gotta get up tomorrow morning for work"". And the promoter says ""Man, once you're in they all lead out. What's the matter man, ain't you heard ?. There's a war going on on the outside. And I'm paying you to sing like a bird. So get in and get tough or get up and get out. Because things aren't too tight"". I said ""Don't worry, man, everything's gonna loosen up. Come the Arabian Night"". Come the Arabian Night. So I get back in my bed. But outside my window I hear another gang fight. It's Duke and the boys against the Devil's best man. And both sides have drawn their knives. And Duke he's a well-known knife-fighter. And with one quick jab he brings the Devil down. He smiles 'cos he knows there's a high bounty on Devils. In any God-fearin' town. Well they say Duke sold the Devil to some priest in Pennsylvania. To exhibit on his altar Christmas Night. But the Devil's eyes they still burn red with fire. As long as Duke walks upright. And he swears there's a going to be a showdown. Come sundown on the Arabian night."

But I found out they tried to conceal. From you, that you were a woman. Well they brought you into their laboratory. And tried to get you to show and tell. They wanted to hear you say that you were sorry. And then they told you that you were conceived in hell. But Baby Doll, you knew. you knew that wasn't true. you knew that it was them. it wasn't you. Oh baby doll. It was so hard to know you. I could not tell, I couldn't show you. But I didn't have to, 'cause you already knew. Oh baby doll. They had to see by touching hands. We had to dance to a silent band. and you surprised me, being so graceful. I know you can't hear these songs I sing. But then they're more for me than they are for you. Because you don't need these songs, babe, like I do. Yeah, you knew the first time that I held you babe. You didn't have to hear how I love. Oh baby doll.

back in your arms,"In my dream our love was lost, I lived by luck and fate. I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late. Now I'm standin' on this empty road where nothin' moves but the wind. And honey I just wanna be back in your arms. Back in your arms again. Back in your arms. Back in your arms again. Once I was your treasure and I saw your face in every star. But the promises we make at night, oh that's all they are. Unless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as the howlin' wind. And honey I just wanna be back in your arms. Back in your arms again. Back in your arms. Back in your arms again. Back in your arms. Back in your arms again. You came to me with love and kindness. But all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness. I met you with indifference and I don't know why. Now I wake from my dream, I wake from my dream to this world. Where all is shadow and darkness andabove me a dark sky unfurls. And all the love I've thrown away and lost I'm longin' for again. Now darlin' I just wanna be back in your arms. Back in your arms again. Back in your arms. Back in your arms again. Back in your arms. Back in your arms again. Back in your arms. Back in your arms again"
backstreets,"One soft infested summer me and Terry became friends. Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in. Catching rides to the outskirts tying faith between our teeth. Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house getting wasted in the heat. And hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets. With a love so hard and filled with defeat. Running for our lives at night on them backstreets. Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing. Where desperate lovers park we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings. Huddled in our cars waiting for the bells that ring. In the deep heart of the night to set us loose from everything. to go running on the backstreets, running on the backstreets. We swore we'd live forever on the backstreets we take it together. Endless juke joints and Valentino drag where dancers scraped the tears. Up off the street dressed down in rags running into the darkness. Some hurt bad some really dying at night sometimes it seemed. You could hear the whole damn city crying blame it on the lies that killed us. Blame it on the truth that ran us down you can blame it all on me Terry. It don't matter to me now when the breakdown hit at midnight. There was nothing left to say but I hated him and I hated you when you went. away. Laying here in the dark you're like an angel on my chest. Just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness. Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see. Trying to learn how to walk like heroes we thought we had to be. And after all this time to find we're just like all the rest. Stranded in the park and forced to confess. To hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets. We swore forever friends on the backstreets until the end. Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets."
badlands,"Lights out tonight. trouble in the heartland. Got a head-on collision. smashin' in my guts, man. I'm caught in a cross fire. that I don't understand. But there's one thing I know for sure girl. I don't give a damn. For the same old played out scenes. I don't give a damn. For just the in betweens. Honey, I want the heart, I want the soul. I want control right now. talk about a dream. Try to make it real. you wake up in the night. With a fear so real. Spend your life waiting. for a moment that just don't come. Well, don't waste your time waiting. (Chorus). Badlands, you gotta live it everyday. Let the broken hearts stand. As the price you've gotta pay. We'll keep pushin' till it's understood. and these badlands start treating us good. Workin' in the fields. till you get your back burned. Workin' `neath the wheel. till you get your facts learned. Baby I got my facts. learned real good right now. You better get it straight darling. Poor man wanna be rich,. rich man wanna be king. And a king ain't satisfied. till he rules everything. I wanna go out tonight,. I wanna find out what I got. Well I believe in the love that you gave me. I believe in the love that you gave me. I believe in the faith that could save me. I believe in the hope. and I pray that some day. It may raise me above these. (Chorus). mmmmmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmmm. For the ones who had a notion,. a notion deep inside. That it ain't no sin. to be glad you're alive. I wanna find one face. that ain't looking through me. I wanna find one place,. I wanna spit in the face of these badlands."
balboa park,He lay his blanket underneath the freeway. As the evening sky grew dark. Took a sniff of toncho from his cocaine. And headed thru Balboa Park. Where the men in their Mercedes. Come nightly to employ. In the cool San Diego evening. The services of the border boys. He grew up near the Zona Norte. With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with. He swallowed their balloons of cocaine. Brought them across to the 12th streetstrip. Sleepin' in a shelter. If the night got to cold. Runnin' from the migra. Of the border patrol. Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks. And in thru the storm drain. They stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway. And each one took a name. There was X-man and Cochise. Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud. They come north to California. End up with the poison in their blood. He did what he had to for the money. Sometimes he sent home what he could spare. The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho. And jeans like the gavachos wear. One night the border patrol swept 12th Street. A big car came fast down the Boulevard. Spider stood caught in its headlights. Got hit and went down hard. As the car sped away=20. Spider held his stomachLimped to his blanket 'neath the freeway. Lay there tasting his own blood on his tongue. Closed his eyes and listened to he cars. Rushin' by so fast.

be true,Your scrapbook's filled with pictures of all your leading men. Well baby don't put my picture in there with them. Don't make us some little girls dream that can't ever come true. That only serves to hurt us and make you cry like you do. Well baby don't do it to me and I won't do it to you. You've seen all the romantic movies you dream you take the boys home. But when the action fades your left all alone. You deserve better than this little girl can't you see you do. Do you need somebody to prove it to you?. Well baby you prove it to me and I'll prove it to you.. Now every night you go out looking for true lust satisfaction. But in the morning you end up with second thoughts that came from your. actions. And another cameo roll with some big player your befriending. Your gonna go broken hearted looking for that happy ending. Well girl your gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold. Crying alone in the theater as the credits roll. You see I won't be like those other guys. Who filled your head with pretty lies. And dreams that can never come true. Well listen. Baby you be true to me and I'll be true to you. So how about it?. Is it a deal?.

They can't hurt you now. Because the night....
better days,"Well my soul checked out missing as I sat listening. To the hours and minutes tickin' away. Yeah, just sittin' around waitin' for my life to begin. While it was all just slippin' away.. I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come. Or that train to come roarin' 'round the bend.. I got a new suit of clothes a pretty red rose. And a woman I can call my friend. These are better days baby. Yeah there's better days shining through. These are better days baby. Better days with a girl like you. Well I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss. It's like eatin' caviar and dirt. It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending. A rich man in a poor man's shirt. Now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon. Your heart like a diamond shone. Tonight I'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms. Out of these heard luck bones. These are better days baby. These are better days it's true. These are better days. There's better days shining through. Now a life of leisure and a pirate's treasure. Don't make much for tragedy. But it's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin. And can't stand the company. Every fool's got a reason to feelin' sorry for himself. And turn his heart to stone. Tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell. And I feel like I'm comin' home. These are better days baby. There's better days shining through. These are better days. Better days with a girl like you. These are better days baby. These are better days it's true. These are better days. Better days are shining through."
bishop dance,"Bishop danced with a thumbscrew woman. Did a double-quick back-flip and slid across the floor. The Catholic traffic flowed freely across the river. And Fiddlestick fiddled quick out the front door. Baby dumpling, mama's in the back tree. If the bough breaks mama might fall. Little sad and only, baby don't be lonely. Mama knows 'rithmetic, knows how to take a fall. Mama knows 'rithmetic, knows how to take a fall. And the kids are crying. Flapjacks, make'em fat, early in the morning. Little Jack, grab your hat. hear the breakfast call. Muskrat, bad old cat, kick him in the fireplace. There's someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah on their. horn. There's someone in the kitchen blowing Dinah like they're. born. Maverick Daddy got one-night prize. The glides like a monkey-mule kickin' on the backslide. Over hill, over hill, Daddy don't you spill now. Papa got a switch-stick, he's pumping little Bill. Papa got a switch-stick, he's pumping little Bill. And Bill, he's crying. Tomahawk, tomahawk, Daddy better duck out. The Mohawks, the Mohawks, they're still out there in the woods. Molatar, Okenah, running through my dreams now. With fire on their fingertips and injun's screams. Fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams. Early in the morning the cannoneer cried. I seem the sailor's warning in the western sky. Oh mountain man, if you can, cut me down a fir tree. Branches full of candlesticks for baby and me. And my darling cried, she said, Honey, the weather vane. lately it's been pointin' the way to heaven. Scatterbrains, Scatterbrains, watch out where you fall Champagne, champagne,. a round for all the old choirboys. They're bustin' off the altar chasing. Dinah through the hall.

black cowboys,"Raney William's playground was among Haven's streets. Where he ran past melted candles and flower wreaths. Names and photos of the young black faces. Whose death and blood consecrated these places. Raney's mother said Raney stay at my side. For you are my blessing, you are my pride. It's your love here that keeps my soul alive. I want you to come home from school and stay inside. Raney'd do his work and put his books away. There was a channel showed a Western movie everyday. And that brought him home books on the black cowboys of the Oklahoma range. The Seminole scouts that fought the tribes of the Great Plains. Summer come and the days grew long. Raney always had his mother's smile to depend on. Along the street of stray bullets he made his way. To the warmth of her arms at the end of each day. Come the Fall, the rain flooded these homes. In Ezekiel's valley of dry bones. It fell hard and dark to the ground. It fell without a sound. And they took up with a man whose business was the boulevard. Whose smile was fixed in a face that was never off guard. In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his secrets are kept. In the day, behind drawn curtains in the next bedroom he slept. And she got lost in the days. The smile Raney depended on dusted away. The arms that held him were no more his own. He lay at night his head pressed to her chest listening to the ghost in her bones. In the kitchen, Raney slipped his hand between the pipes. From a brown bag pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side. Stood in the dark at his mother's bed. Brushed her hair and kissed her eyes. In the twilight Raney walked to the station on streets of stone. Through Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on. Through the small towns of Indiana the big train crept. As he lay his head back on his seat and slept. He woke and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green. Corn and cotton and endless nothing in between. Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun slipped and was gone. The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone"
blinded by the light,"Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat. In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat. With a boulder on my shoulder feelin' kinda older I tripped the merry-go-round. With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope crashed to the ground. Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot snappin' his fingers clappin' his hands. And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand. And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand. And some bloodshot forget-menot whispers daddy's within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band. And she was blinded by the light. Cut loose like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright. Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone preacher from the east. He says: ""Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least"". And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance. And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance. Yeah he was blinded by the light. Cut loose like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. He got down but she never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight. Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes. She said I'll turn you on sonny to something strong if you play that song with the funky break. And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside. And little Early-Pearly came in by her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride. Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier. Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent a dude with a calling card,. he said, do what you like, but don't do it here. Well I jumped up, spit in the air, fell on the ground, asked wich was the way back home. He said take a right at the light, keep going straight until right, and then boy you're on your own. And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune. Yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon. And some kidnapped handicap was complaining that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night. Well I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but he'd figured he'd be all right. He was just blinded by the light. Cut loose like a deuce. Another runner in the night. Blinded by the light. Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun. Oh but mama that's where the fun is."
blood brothers,"We played king of the mountain out on the end. The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men. Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away. We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take. We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other. We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers. Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away. Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make. And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray. We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay. And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover. With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother. On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks. Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back. Now I don't know how I feel, I don't know how I feel tonight. If I've fallen 'neath the wheel, if I've lost or I've gained sight. I don't even know why, I don't know why I made this call. Or if any of this matters anymore after all. But the stars are burnin' bright like some mystery uncovered. I'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart. My blood brother."
bobby jean,"Well I came by your house the other day, your mother said you went away. She said there was nothing that I could have done. There was nothing nobody could say. Me and you we've known each other ever since we were sixteen. I wished I would have known I wished I could have called you. Just to say goodbye Bobby Jean. Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their noise. We liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes. We told each other that we were the wildest, the wildest things we'd ever. seen. Now I wished you would have told me I wished I could have talked to you. Just to say goodbye Bobby Jean. Now we went walking in the rain talking about the pain from the world we hid. Now there ain't nobody nowhere nohow gonna ever understand me the way you did. Maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere. In some bus or train traveling along. In some motel room there'll be a radio playing. And you'll hear me sing this song. Well if you do you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between. And I'm just calling one last time not to change your mind. But just to say I miss you baby, good luck goodbye, Bobby Jean."
book of dreams,I'm standing in the backyard. Listening to the party Inside. Tonight I'm drinkin' in the forgiveness. This life provides. The scars we carry remain but the pain slips away it seems. Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams. I'm watchin' you through the window. With your girlfriends from back home. You 're showin' off your dress. There's laughter and a toast. From your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen. Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams. In the darkness my fingers slip across your skin. I feel your sweet reply. The room fades away and suddenly I'm way up high. Just holdin' you to me. As through the window the moonlight streams. Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams. Now the ritual begins. 'Neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers. The dance floor is alive with beauty. Mystery and danger. We dance out 'neath the stars' ancient light into the darkening trees. Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams.
border guard,"BORDER GUARD. Bless on the border guard so cold and alone. Bless on the child so far from his home. Pity the border guard who feels like a woman to cry. Pity the border guard whose life guards the line. A light is a funny thing. A border sometime. A light is a hurting thing. Use only to divine. I pity the refugee whose home lies behind. I pity the border guard and his border line. He keeps his machine gun nose pointed to the sky. The night time is his master. And you know the dawn light brings his captor. And I pity the border guard as he walks, well as he walks his own. The echo of his foot steps is all a friend would know. A home is a funny thing. You get tied to the earth. Like a love is a crazy thing. In the eye of a child. I Pity the border guard whose soul taken captive at birth. May the sweet brace of his grief and show him how to be so wild. Yes a light is a funny thing. A border sometimes. A light is a hurting thing. Used only to divine. He who made the open plains and the world one and all. Could not have conceived with a barbed wire brain. For the building of the wall and at night I keep my fire bright. So that I may be safe when I sleep. Till I wake on that wonderful morning with no more light well ooh."

born to run,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets. Of a runaway American dream. At night we ride through mansions of glory. In suicide machines. Sprung from cages on Highway 9.

'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider. But I gotta know how it feels. I wanna know if your love is wild. Baby, I wanna know if love is real. Beyond the place hemi-powered drones. Scream down the boulevard. Girls comb their hair in rear view mirrors. And the boys try to look so hard. The amusement park rises bold and stark. And kids are huddled on the beach in the mist. I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight. In an everlasting kiss. One, two, three, four. Highway's jammed with broken heroes. On a last-chance power drive. Everybody's out on the road tonight but. There's no place left to hide. Together Wendy we can live with the sadness. I'll love you with all the madness in my soul. Oh, someday girl I don't know when. We're gonna get to that place where really wanna go. And we'll walk in the sun. But till then tramps like us, baby we were born to run. Tramps like us, baby we were born to run.

cautious man,Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road. He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code. When something caught his eye he'd measure his need. And then very carefully he'd proceed. Billy met a young girl in the early days of May. It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away. In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim. He'd lay back in her arms and laugh what had happened to him. On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear. And in which hand he held his fate was never clear. Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride. And with own hands built a great house down by the riverside. Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right. He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights. Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray. For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay. One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name. She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep a thousand miles away. He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode. When he got there he didn't find nothing but road. Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name. Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain. At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white. Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light.

chimes of freedom,"Well, far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll. We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashin'. As majestic bells of boats struck shadows in the sun;. Sayin', it may be the chimes of freedom flashin'. Flashin' for the warriors whose strength is not to fight;. Flashin' for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight.. And for each and every underdog soldier in the night. We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'. Well, in the city's melted furnace unexpectedly we watched. With faces hidden here while the walls were tightenin'. As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain;. Dissolved into the wild bales of lightnin'. Yeah, tollin' for the rebel, yeah, tollin' for the raked. Tollin' for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked.. Yeah, tollin' for the outcasts burnin' constantly at stakes. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'. Oh yeah! (instrumental solo). And then through a cloud-like curtain in a far off corner flashed. There's a hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly liftin'. Well, electric light still struck like arrows. Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'. Well, tollin' for the searching ones on this speechless, secret trail. For the lonesome haunted lovers with too personal a tale.. And for each young heart for each channeled soul misplaced inside a jail. Yeah, we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'. Well, starry eyed and laughin' i recall when we were caught,. Trapped by an old track of vows for the hands suspended. As we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look. Spellbound and swallowed ""has the tollin' ended?"". Yeah, tollin' for the achin' ones whose wounds cannot be nursed. For the countless, confused, accused, misused strung out ones at worst.. And for every hung out person in the whole wide universe. We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'. Uh uh uh... (to end)"

cowboys of the sea,"They ride beneath the waves at 20,000 leagues. On stallions stitched to seaweed strands. So smiling, so smiling. They herd the fishes of the deep. They ride for you and me. They ranch the rich and the sunken soil. At the bottom of the sea. In the dead of night, alive in sleep. I hear them calling me. Them deep sea desperadoes. Them midnight maelstrom freaks. The cowboy of the sea. So on wings of sleep I pierce the deep. And ride like a hurricane. At midnight still I paid my bill. And turned my back on the land. With the help of Old Paint, that seaweed nag. It's just Jesse James and me. We ride the depths and rob the banks. At the bottom of the sea. With a seaman's grip on navigation. And some fired, hired hands. We set forth to confront the nation. And lend a cowboy's hand. We do the Dolphins' Dance duet. My mermaid babe and me. Then I ride of into the blue sunset. At the bottom of the sea. And with the seaman's grip on submarining. And some aqualung outlaws. Our guns are made of solid dreamin'. And bullets from a broken cause. And with hand held high to touch the sky. A good Texas Ranger I'll beBut sometimes I feel like a lone stranger. 'Midst the cowboys of the sea. Oh and men above he cannot make love. He's got to rape his mother the sea. And because of his greed. We're a vanishing breed. We cowboys of the sea."

devil´s arcade,"Devil's Arcade. Remember the morning we dug up your gun. The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun. Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin. The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in. The rush of your lips, the feel of your name. The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade. You said ""Heroes are needed, so heroes get made"". Somebody made a bet, somebody paid. The cool desert morning and nothing to save. Just metal and plastic where your body caved. The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray. In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name. Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade. You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James. And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin. [Instrumental]. Voice says ""don't worry, I'm here. Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear"". House on a quiet street, a home for the brave. A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face. Rising from a long night as dark as the grave. On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith. On a morning to order a breakfast to make. A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits. For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day. The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart. The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart. The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart. The beat of your heart, the slow burning away. Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade"

dollhouse,"Well ever since you were a little girl. You set the rules in your little world. But girls grow up and throw their toys away. You're a big girl now but you still wanna play.

But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down. Everything's as you dreamed it would be. But there's something wrong that you can't see. Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw. A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall. Something, girl, that will explain away. The hurt you feel, darling, when we play. Your little dolls they got a grip on you. Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too. We're living in a dollhouse. Girl, we're living in a dollhouse. Oh we're living in a dollhouse. We may feel safe and sound. But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down. Oh we're living in a dollhouse. Girl, we're living in a dollhouse. Yeah we're living in a dollhouse."
don't look back,"Cold rain running down the front of my shirt. I'm flat on my back wheels in the dirt. Angel makes her face up out on baker Street. She's straddlin; the shifter in my front seat. There's nothing to lose. It's a set-up (heartbreak). The deck's stacked. So put your foot to the floor. And darling don't look back. Well making night tracks through the blazing rain. Blow them pistons, work (move) in the fast lane. White line burning, pockets full of cash. Angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash. There's nothing to lose. It's a set-up (except a heartbreak) (just a bad break). The deck's stacked (baby we're back). Tonight we'll blow off the doors (Put your foot to the floor). And honey we won't look back (And darling don't look back). We held it in our hearts in the pouring rain. We made it through the heart of a hurricane. We tore it apart and put it together again. We'll wash out sins, girl down in the sea. Angel won't you believe in love for me. (Come on meet me tonight darlin' out in the street). We'll move with the city in the dark. You got to walk it talk it in your heart. There's nothin' to lose. It's a set-up (just a heartache). The deck's stacked. So put your foot to the floor (and) darling. Tonight we'll blow out (off) the doors darling (baby). Put your foot to the floor (we're gonna even the score). And darling don't look back (honey we won't look back). Don't look back. Ah, baby, don't look back."
down in the hole,"Sun comes every morning, but it ain't no friend. I get dressed and I go back again. The rain keeps on falling on twisted bones and dirt. I'm buried to my heart here in this hurt. The fire keeps on burning, you're waiting in the cold. Down in the hole, down in the hole. Dark and bloody autumn pierces my heart. The memory of your kiss tears me apart. The sky above is turning, the world below's gone gray. I thought that I could turn and walk away. But the fire keeps on burning, and I'm working in the cold. Down in the hole, down in the hole. Radio's crackling with the headlines. Wind in the phone lines. The sun upon your shoulder. Empty city skylines. The day rips apart, a dark and bloody pierced my heart. I got nothing but heart and sky and sunshine. the things you left behind. I wake to find my city's gone to black. Days just keep on falling. Your voice keeps on calling. I'm going to dig right here until I get you back. The fires keep on burning. I'm here with you in the cold. Down in the hole, down in the hole"
downbound train,"I had a job, I had a girl. I had something going mister in this world. I got laid off down at the lumber yard. Our love went bad, times got hard. Now I work down at the carwash. Where all it ever does is rain. Don't you feel like you're a rider on a downbound train. She just said ""Joe I gotta go. We had it once we ain't got it any more"". She packed her bags left me behind. She bought a ticket on the Central Line. Nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining. Feel her kiss in the misty rain. And I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train. Last night I heard your voice. You were crying, crying, you were so alone. You said your love had never died. You were waiting for me at home. Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods. I ran till I thought my chest would explode. There in the clearing, beyond the highway. In the moonlight, our wedding house shone. I rushed through the yard, I burst through the front door. My head pounding hard, up the stairs I climbed. The room was dark, our bed was empty. Then I heard that long whistle whine. And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried. Now I swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang. Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain. Now don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train."

drive all night,"When I lost you honey sometimes I think. I lost my guts too. And I wish God would send me a word send me something I'm afraid to lose. Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives. I get shivers down my spine and all. I wanna do is hold you tight. (Chorus). I swear I'll drive all night again just to buy you some shoes. And to taste your tender charms. And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms. Tonight there's fallen angels and they're waiting for us down in the street. Tonight there's calling strangers, hear them crying in defeat.. Let them go,. let them go,. let them go,. do their dances of the dead (let'em go right ahead). You just dry your eyes girl,. and c'mon c'mon c'mon let's go to bed,. baby, baby, baby. (Chorus).

Now-closer still now. Drop on down and cover me. On down and cover me."
dry lightning,I threw my robe on in the morning. Watched the ring on the stove turn red. Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee. Pulled on my boots and made the bed. Screen door hangin' off its hinges. Kept bangin' me awake all night. As I look out the window. The only thing in site. Is dry lightning on the horizon line. Just dry lightning and and you on my mind. I chased the heat of her blood. Like it was the holy grail. Descend beautiful spirit. Into the evening pale. Her appaloosa's. Kickin' in the corral smelling rain. There's a low thunder rolling'Cross the mesquite plain. But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line. It's just dry lightning and and you on my mind. I'd drive down to Alvarado Street. Where she'd dance to make ends meet. I'd spend the night over my gin. As she'd talk to her men. Well the piss yellow sun. Comes bringin' up the day. She said 'Ain't nobody can give nobody. What they really need anyway.'. Well you get so sick of the fightin'. You lose your fear of the end. But I can't lose your memory. And the sweet smell of your skin. And it's just dry lightning on the horizonline. Just dry lightning and and you on my mind.

evacuation of the west,"It was on the day the cowboys were abandoned from the ranch. Middle touch world as a master. They rode their ponies down in the cities of gold. To leave them for ever after.

fade to black,Sunday matinee. In a one dog town. You're two seats away. I move two seats down. Wipe the tears from your eyes. The first kiss i stole. I walk you home. The credits roll. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. I hear my voice. On the telephone. But I'm just running. The same old business. I feel like I'm off. Somewhere so alone. Just watching us both. Running the distance. Watching us both. Slowly pull back. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. I come home. Clothes all over the place. You're crying in the corner. Makeup running down your face. Your case is packed. The fight starts. I (?????) cursin'. Baby is this the scene. Which we been rehearsin'. Is this the one. Or have i lost track. Waitin' for us. To fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. A face wet with shame. Eyes filled with hurt. I scream out your name. You rip my shirt. A small bungalow. A late afternoon. The sunlight falls. Like a bright veil. A camera pans. An empty room. The picture dissolves. Slowly pulls back. Fade to black. Fade to black. Fade to black. . . . .

for you,"Princess cards she sends me with her regards. Barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard. Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted. To her Cheshire smile. I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted. But you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts. Honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back. You wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks. You said ""Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks"". But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too. I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency. I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long. emergency. And your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges free. Crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak. Reveal yourself all now to me girl while you've got the strength to speak. `Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks. But I could give it all to you now if only you could ask. And don't call for your surgeon even he says it's too late. It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate. Don't give me money, honey, I don't want it back. You and your pony face and your union jack. Well take your local joker and teach him how to act. I swear I was never that way even when I really cracked. Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?. And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive. You could laugh and cry in a single sound. And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds. Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god?. You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach. Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach. And the band they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek. They ragged, jagged melody she still clings to me like a leach. But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way. Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way. We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar. Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore. So you, left to find a better reason than the one we were living for. And it's not that nursery mouth I came back for. It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor. `Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors. And who am I to ask you to lick my sores? And you should know that's true. I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency. I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long. emergency. And your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges free."
frankie,"Dark weekends in the sun, out on Chelsea Row. Descending the stairs, Frankie my love. Check your make-up in the mirror. Come on, baby, let's go. We'll dance round this dirty town. 'Till the night is all done. Then all the finer things sleep alone tonight. Then all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight. Don't worry about me baby, I'll be alright. There's machines and there's fire. On the outside of town. Young boys for hire. Waiting to blow us all down. There are strange flashes in the sky up above. I'll spend the night at the movies. With my secret love. At dusk the stars all appear on the screen. Just like they do each night in my dreams. But tonight's no dream, Frankie. I can feel myself move. Living and dying. Like I was born to do. Walk softly tonight little angel. I wanna be alone with you. Talk softly to me tonight angel. Make all my dream-world come true. I remember standing in the freezing rain. Reading them ""Want"" ads out on Chelsea Row. Winging down the street in search of new games. Hustling through the night packs where the actors go. Frankie they are crazy, let's run and hide. In the darkness there'll be hidden worlds that shine. When all of the glory in this desperate land. Will rise like raindrops in the palm of our hands. Rise like the rain. Let your sadness rise. Walk softly tonight little angel. Into the shadows where the lovers go. Talk softly tonight angel. Whisper your secrets so soft and low."

freehold,"I was born right here on Randolph Street in Freehold. Here right behind that big red maple in Freehold. I went to school right here. Got laid and had my first beer. Here in Freehold. Well, my folks all lived and worked right here in Freehold. I remember running up the street past the convent to the church in Freehold. Chased my daddy down in these bars. First fell in love with this guitar. Here in Freehold. I had my first kiss at the YMCA canteen on a Friday night. Maria Espinoza baby where are you tonight. You were thirteen but way ahead of your time. I walked home with a limp but I felt just fine. That night in Freehold. Well now the girls at Freehold Regional yeah they all looked pretty fine. I had my heart broken at least half a dozen times. I wonder if they miss me if they still get the itch. Would they have dumped me if they knew I'd strike a rich. Straight out of Freehold. Well, a lot of good folks gave us kids a hand in Freehold. When we started up our rock and roll band in Freehold. Yeah we learned pretty quick how to rock. I'll never forget the feeling of that first five bucks in my pocket. That I earned in Freehold. Well, I got outta here hard and fast in Freehold. Everybody wanted to kick my ass back then in Freehold. Well if you were different or black or brown. It was a pretty redneck town. Back in Freehold. Well, now something broke my daddy's back in Freehold. He left for thirty years he'd never come back. 'cept once he drove from California in just three days. Called my relatives some dirty names. And pulled straight out of Freehold. Now heâ€™s there by the highway buried in the dirt. His ghost flippinâ€™ the bird to everybody in Freehold. Well my sister got pregnant at seventeen in Freehold. Back then people they could be pretty mean. Ah honey you had a rough road to go now you ain't made of nothin' but soul. I love you more than you'll ever know. We both survived Freehold. Well my buddy Mike he's the mayor now in Freehold. I remember when we had a lot more hair in Freehold. I left and swore I'd never walk those streets again Jack. Now all I can say is Holy shit I'm back. Back in Freehold. Well I read something in the papers a few weeks ago that was pretty funny. The town council is debating whether to put up a statue of me in my home town. But it cost too much money. Well Iâ€™d like to thank the town council my friends. For saving me from humiliation and displaying the good hard common sense. We learned in Freehold. Well, this summer everything was green. Rode my kids on the fire engine through the streets of Freehold. I bored 'em with where dad was born and raised. And first felt the sun on his face. In Freehold. Well I still got a lot of real good friends back there. And I can usually find a free beer somewhere. With free dinners I am blessed. Should I go crazy, blow all my money, hit the tabloids. Become fodder for moronic talk shows and turn my life into a complete fuckinâ€™ mess. Well, at least I'll never go hungry I guess. In Freehold. I got a good Catholic education in Freehold. Led to an awful lot of masturbation in Freehold. Well Father it was just something I did for a smile. Hell I still get a good one off once in a while. And dedicate it to Freehold. Don't get me wrong, I ain't puttin' anybody down. In the end it all just goes and comes around. In my hometown back in Freehold."

And brought his family to the promised land. Seabrook, Texas and the small towns in the Gulf of Mexico. It was delta country and reminded him of home. He worked as a machinist, put his money away. And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin. And together they harvested Galveston Bay. In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up. He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter. Steer out thru thechannel. And cast his nets into the water. Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company. In the highlands of Quang Tri. He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai. Shipped home in '68.

Billy sat in front of his TV as the South fell. And the communists rolled into Saigon. He and his friends watched as the refugees came. Settled on the same streets and worked the coast they'd grew up on. Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk. Of America for the Americans. Someone said 'You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out.'. And brought in the Texas Klan. One humid Texas night there were 3 shadows on the harbor. Come to burn the Vietnamese into the sea. In the fire's light shots rang out. 2 Texans lay dead on the ground. Le stood with a pistol in his hand. A jury acquitted him in self-defense. As before the judge he did stand. But as Le walked down the courthouse steps. Billy said 'My friend you're a dead man.'. One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside. Billy stood in the shadows. His K-bar knife in his hand. And the moon slipped behind the clouds. Le lit a cigarette, the bay was still as glass. As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket. Took a breath and let him pass. In the early darkness Billy rose up. Went into the kitchen for a drink of water. Kissed his sleeping wife. Headed into the channel. And cast his nets into the water.

It's a place where a man can really feel his succes. So he pulled his heart and soul down off the shelf. Packed them next to the faith that he'd lost in himself. Said his good-byes and when the dirty work was done. He turned his wheels into the fading sun. For seven days and nights like a black-top bird he sped. Maintained radio silence 'cept for in his head. And just like his folks did back in '69. He crossed the border at Needles and heard the promised land on the line. Now where the Transcontinental dumps into the sea. There's a bar made up to look like 1963. Girl in the corner eyed him like a hungry dog a bone. As he brushed the desert dust off that Mercedes chrome. Bartender said ""Hey, how's it hangin', tiger?"". He had a shot of tequila, smiled and whispered ""lighter"". He went down to the desert city where the rattlesnakes play. And left his dead skin by the roadside in the noon of day. Sun got so hot it almost felt like friend. It could burn out every trace of where you been. There was a woman he'd met in a desert song. A little while later a son come along. Looked at that boy's smile and called it home. And that night as he lay in bed the only voice he heard was his own"

I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch. I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Sit down' I stood up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing. I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could. sing. I pushed B-52 and bombed `em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on. standing. I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to. landing. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Come down' I threw. up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard. to hold your breath. I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared. I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress. Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little. place in the stars. I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said`Sit down'I stood up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. Ooh-ooh growin' up.
gypsy biker,"Gypsy Biker. The speculators made their money on the blood you shed. Your momma's pulled the sheets up off your bed. Profiteers on Jhames Street sold your shoes and clothes. Ain't nobody talkin' because everybody knows. We pulled your cycle up back the garage and polished up the chrome*. Our gypsy biker coming home. Sister Mary sits with your colors, but Johnny's drunk and gone. This old town's been rousted, which side you on?. They would march up over the hill, this old fools parade. Shouting victory for the righteous for you must hear the grace. Ain't nobody talkin', but just waiting on the phone. Gypsy biker coming home. Whoa!. [Guitar solo]. We rode into the foothills, Bobby brought the gasoline. We stood around the circle as she lit up the ravine. The spring hot desert wind rushed down on us all the way back home. [Harmonica bridge]. To the dead, well it don't matter much 'bout who's wrong or right. You asked me that question, I didn't get it right. You slipped into your darkness, now all that remains. Is my love for you brother, life's still unchanged. To him that threw you away, you ain't nothing but gone. My gypsy biker's coming home. And now I'm out countin' white lines. Countin' white lines and getting stoned. My gypsy biker's coming home. Whoa!. [Sax solo]. La la la la. La la la la. La la la la. La la la la. La la la la. La la la la. La la la la. La la la la.

gypsy woman,"From nowhere through the caravan. Round the campfire light. Lovely woman in motion. With hair as dark as night. Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark. that hypnotized me with love. She was a gypsy woman. She was a gypsy woman. She was a gypsy woman. She was a gypsy woman. She was a gypsy woman. She danced around and round. Guitar's melody. From the fire her face was aglow. How she enchanted me. I'd like to hold her near. And kiss her hair and whisper in her ear. I love you gypsy woman. I love you gypsy woman. I love you gypsy woman. I love you gypsy woman. All through the caravan. She was dancing with all the men. Waiting for the rising sun. Everyone was having fun. Hated to see her go. Knowing that she'll never know. that I love her. that I love her. I love you gypsy woman. I love you gypsy woman. I love you gypsy woman. I love you gypsy woman. Whoever compared it to Part Monkey Part Man hit the nail on the head. It has that same kind of dark, mysterious sound. The vocals are soft and understated, somewhat reminiscent to those on If I should fall behind or Pony Boy. The song is sung with that nasally twang Bruce has grown so fond of lately.."
happy,"Some need gold and some need diamond rings. Or a drug to take away the pain that living brings. A promise of a better world to come. When whatever here is done. I don't need that sky of blue. All I know's since I found you, I'm happy when I'm in your arms. Happy, darling, come the dark. Happy when I taste your kiss. I'm happy in a love like this. There's a house upon a distant hill. Where you can hear the laughter of children ring. Guardian angels, they watch from above. Watching over the love that they bring. But at night I feel the darkness near, I awake and I find you near. I'm happy with you in my arms. I'm happy with you in my heart. Happy when I taste your kiss. I'm happy in love like this. In a world of doubt and fear. I wake at night and reach to find you near. Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell. I want more than just a dream to tell. We're born in this world, darling, with few days and trouble never far behind. Man and woman circle each other in a cage. A cage that's been handed down the line. Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars. Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars. Happy in each other's arms. Happy baby, come the dark. Happy in each other's kiss. I m happy in a love like this."

To write your name up on the girls' room wall. And send you out to Maria. Who spoke of babies and all. And wanted to shoot your joy. It's a hard world when you're the new kid in town. Ain't it, Henry Boy. Well the North side is for diamond-studded woman. Subtly selling their wares. And the West side is for debutantes. And would be millionaires. Oh the East side is for lost boys.

Riding underground for the Pope. Gonna stand on the corner of Broadway. And scream: ""Up 'scope""."

highway 29,"I slipped on her shoe, she was a perfect size 7. I said ""There's no smokin' in the store ma'am""She crossed her legs and then. We made some small talk that's where it should have stopped. She slipped me her number, I put it in my pocket. My hand slipped up her skirt, everything slipped my mind. In that little roadhouse. On highway 29. It was a small town bank it was a mess. Well I had a gun you know the rest. Money on the floorboards, shirt was covered in blood. And she was cryin', her and me we headed south. On highway 29. In a little desert motel the air was hot and clean. I slept the sleep of the dead, I didn't dream. I woke in the morning, washed my face in the sink. We headed into the Sierra Madres 'cross the border line. The winter sun shot thru the black trees. I told myself it was all something in her. But as we drove I knew it was something in me. Something that had been comin' for a long time. And something that was here with me now. On highway 29. The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline. She wasn't sayin' nothin', it was just a dream. The wind was coming silent thru the windshield. All I could see was snow, sky and pines. I closed my eyes and was runnin'. I was runnin' then I was flyin'."

hollywood kids,They're the Hollywood kids each and every one. With a high class smile and a little baby's tongue. Lonely hard head losers dressed in the tinsel of the times. And learn all the latest lines and the order in which they come. So perfumed sweet and so obscene. Like the fancy dancers of our dirty green. Oh they knew hello and good bye but not what goes in between. Yea and its such a scene on Saturday night. Fifth avenue freaks strait off the racks. They swear you can buy and sell your soul on a good dat outside. They're the Hollywood kids each and everyone. And on Sunday back into their holes they run. And on Monday here I stand alone on this littered stage like an animal who. forgot he was in a cage. Just a restless soul. Just waiting for 'em to come. They're Hollywood kids each and everyone.
how can i keep from singing,"My life flows on in endless song. Above earth's lamentation.. I hear the real, thought far off hymn. That hails the new creation. Above the tumult and the strife,. I hear the music ringing;. It sounds an echo in my soul. How can I keep from singing?. What through the tempest loudly roars,. I hear the truth, it liveth.. What through the darkness round me close,. Songs in the night it giveth.. No storm can shake my inmost calm. While to that rock I'm clinging.. Since love is lord of Heaven and earth. How can I keep from singing?. When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,. And hear their death-knell ringing,. When friends rejoice both far and near,. How can I keep from singing?. In prison cell and dungeon vile. Our thoughts to them are winging.. When friends by shame are undefiled,. How can I keep from singing?"
human touch,"You and me we were the pretenders. We let it all slip away. In the end what you don't surrender. Well the world just strips away. Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers.

I just want someone to talk to. And a little of that Human Touch. Just a little of that Human Touch. Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town. Ain't no bread from Heavenly skies. Ain't nobody drawing wine from this blood. It's just you and me tonight. Tell me, in a world without pity. Do you think what I'm askin's too much. I just want something to hold on to. And a little of that Human Touch. Just a little of that Human Touch. Oh girl that feeling of safety that you prize. Well it comes at a hard hard price. You can't shut off the risk and the pain. Without losing the love that remains. We're all riders on this train. So you've been broken and you've been hurt. Show me somebody who ain't. Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain. But, hell, a little touch up and a little paint.... You might need something to hold on to. When all the answers, they don't amount to much. Somebody that you could just to talk to. And a little of that Human Touch. Baby, in a world without pity. Do you think what I'm askin's too much. I just want to feel you in my arms. Share a little of that Human Touch. Feel a little of that Human Touch. Give me a little of that Human Touch."
hungry heart,"Got a wife and kids in baltimore, jack. I went out for a ride and I never went back. Like a river that don't know where it's flowing. I took a wrong turn and I just kept going.

hunter of invisible game,"I hauled myself up out of a ditch. I built me an ark out of gopher wood and pitch. Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain. Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game. Well I woke last night to the heavy clicking and clack. And a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks. There were empty cities and burning plains. Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game. We all come up a little short and we go down hard. These days I spend my time skipping through the dark. Through the empires of dust I chant your name. Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game. Through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on. Down into the valley where the beast has his throne. I sing my song and I sharpen my blade. Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game. Strength is vanity and time is illusion. I feel you breathing, the rest is confusion. Your skin touches mine, what else to explain. Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game. Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall. When the hour of deliverance comes on us all. When high hope and faith and courage and trust. Can rise or vanish like dust and dust. Now there's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed. Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game. Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game. Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game"
i ain't got no home,"I ain't got no home, I'm just a ramblin' around. A hard working ramblin' man, I go from town to town. The police make it hard wherever I may go. And I ain't got no home in this world anymore. I was farmin' on the shares and always I was poor. My crops I laid into the banker's door. And my wife took down and died upon the cabin floor. And I ain't got no home in this world anymore. I ain't got no home, I'm just a ramblin' around. A hard working ramblin' man, I go from town to town. The police make it hard wherever I may go. And I Ain't Got No Home in this world anymore. Now as I look around it's mighty plain to see. This wide wicked world is a funny place to be. The gamblin' man is rich and the workin' man is poor. And I ain't got no home in this world anymore."

I wanna be with you. I wanna be with you. That's what I wanna do. Bedtime, hold tight, love me just a little bit. All night, a little bit more. Tonight, tonight .... Oh I don't know, I don't know. I don't understand itYou ain't pretty at all. But I come when you whisper. I run when you call. And baby I can't stand it. And baby that's all. Ridin' by your side in my car. Oh, oh I wanna be with you. I wanna be with you. Darlin' don't you know. Oh, oh I wanna be with you. I wanna be with you. Because I love you so."
i wanna marry you,"I see you walking, baby, down the street. Pushing that baby carriage at your feet. I see the lonely ribbon in your hair. Tell me I am the man for whom you put it there. You never smile girl, you never speak. You just walk on by, darlin' week after week. Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world. Must be a lonely life for a working girl. (Chorus). Little girl, I wanna marry you. Oh yeah, little girl, I wanna marry you. Yes I do. Little girl, I wanna marry you. Now honey, I don't wanna clip your wings. But a time comes when two people should think of these things. Having a home and a family. Facing up to their responsibilities. They say in the end true love prevails. But in the end true love can't be no fairytale. To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong. But maybe, darlin', I could help them along. (Chorus). My daddy said right before he died. That true, true love was just a lie. He went to his grave a broken heart. An unfulfilled life, makes a man hard. Oh, darlin'. There's something happy and there's something sad. 'Bout wanting somebody, oh so bad,. I wear my love darlin', without shame. I'd be proud if you would wear my name."
i want you,The guilty undertaker sighs. The lonesome organ grinder cries. The silver saxophone says. I should refuse you. The cracked bells and washed out horns. Blow into my face with scorn. But it's not that way. I wasn't born to lose you. I want you I want you. I want you so bad. Honey I want you. The drunken politician leaps. Upon the streets where mothers weep. And the saviors who are fast asleep. They wait for you. And I wait for them to interrupt. Me drinking from my broken cup. And ask me to open up. The gate for you. Now all my fathers. They've gone down. True love. They've been without it. But all their daughters. Put me down. 'Cause I don't. Think about it. Well I return to the queen of spades. And talk with my chamber maid. She knows that I'm not afraid to. Look at her. She is good to me and there's. Nothing she doesn't see. She knows where I'd like to be. But it doesn't matter. Now your dancing child with the chinese suit. He spoke to me I took his flute. No I wasn't very cute to him. Was I. But I did it because he lied. Because he took you for a ride. And because time was on his side. And because I. Want you I want you. I want you so bad. Honey I want you.
i wish i were blind,"I love to see the cottonwood blossom in the early spring. I love to see the message of love that the bluebird brings. But when I see you walking with him down along the strand. I wish I were blind when I see you with your man. I love to see your hair shining in the long summer's light. I love to watch the stars fill the sky on a summer night. The music plays, you take his hand. I watch how you touch him as you start to dance. And I wish I were blind when I see you with your man. We struggle here but all our love's in vain. And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty now fill me with pain. And the light that once entered here is banished from me. And this darkness is all, baby, that my heart sees. And though the world is filled with the grace and beauty of God's hand. Oh I wish I were blind when I see you with your man."
i'll work for your love,"I'll Work For Your Love. Pour me a drink Theresa in one of those glasses you dust off. And I'll watch the bones in your back like the stations of the cross. 'Round your hair the sun lifts a halo, at your lips a crown of thorns. Whatever the deal's going down, to this one I'm sworn. I'll work for your love dear. I'll work for your love. What others may want for free. I'll work for your love. The dust of civilizations and love's sweet remains. Slip off of your fingers and come drifting down like rain. The pages of Revelation lie open in your empty eyes of blue. I watch you slip that comb through your hair and this I promise you. I'll work for your love dear. I'll work for your love. What others may want for free. I'll work for your love. [Instrumental]. Well tears they fill the rosary, at your feet my temple of bones. Here in this perdition we go on and on. Now I see your pieces crumbled and our book of faith's been tossed. And I'm just down here searching for my own piece of the cross. In the late afternoon sun fills the room with a mist in the garden before the fall. I watch your hands smooth the front of your blouse and seven drops of blood fall. I'll work for your love dear. I'll work for your love. What others may want for free. I'll work for your love. What others may want for free. I'll work for your love. What others may want for free. I'll work for your love"
i'm a coward (when it comes to love),"I ain't afraid of no lions. I ain't afraid of no grizzly bear. I got in a wrestlin' match with old King Kong. He didn't even muss my hair. There's just one thing in the whole wide world. That make me doubt my stuff. I'm a coward when it comes to love. Now bring down old Hulk Hogan. King Kong Bundy too. Bring down old Big Mike Tyson. I'll show them what a real man can do. They say the tougher' get goin'. Now baby that's when the goin' get tough. But I'm a coward when it comes to love. I'm a coward when it comes to love. I'm a coward when it comes to love. You can bring on a different sexy girl. At every night of the week. Buddy that's okay. But I start tremblin', my knees get weak. Whenever I hear her say. ""Do you love me baby?"". ""Do you love me baby?"". ""Do you love me baby?"". I got a muscle of iron. I got another muscle made of steel. But when we start kissin' 'n' huggin'. You may be the bravest man in the whole wide world. But Buddy, that ain't enough. I'm a coward when it comes to love. I'm a coward when it comes to love. I'm a coward when it comes to love."
i'm a rocker,"I got a 007 watch and it's a one and only. It's got a I-Spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely. I got a Batmobile so I can reach ya' in a fast shake. When your world's in crisis of an impendin' heartbreak. Now don't you call James Bond or Secret Agent Man. Cause they can't do it, like I can. I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day. I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker. If you're hanging from a cliff or you're tied to the tracks, girl. Columbo split and you can't find Kojak. True love is broken and your tears are fallin' faster. You're sufferin' from a pain in your heart. or some other natural disaster. Now I don't care what kind of shape you're in. If they put up a roadblock, I'll parachute in. I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - I'm in love. I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day. I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - with you. So you fell for some jerk who was tall, dark and handsome. Then he kidnapped your heart and now he's holdin' it for ransom. Well, like a mission impossible I'm gonna go and get it back. You know I would'a taken better care of it, baby, than that. Sometimes I get so hot girl, well, I can't talk. But when I'm with you I cool off , and I walk. I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, and I talk. I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day. I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day."
i'm goin' down,"We sit in the car outside your house. I can feel the heat coming 'round. I go to put my arm around you. and you give me a look like I'm way out of bounds. well you let out one of your bored sighs. Well lately when I look into your eyes. I'm goin down. We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night. We come home early burning, burning in some fire fight. I'm sick and tired of you setting me up. Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down. I pull you close but when we kiss I can feel a doubt. I remember back when we started. My kisses used to turn you inside out. I used to drive you to work in the morning. Friday night I'd drive you all around. You used to love to drive me wild. But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down."
i'm on fire,Hey little girl is your daddy home. Did he go away and leave you all alone. I got a bad desire. I'm on fire. Tell me now baby is he good to you. Can he do to you the things that I do. I can take you higher. I'm on fire. Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby. edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley. through the middle of my soul. At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet. and a freight train running through the. middle of my head. Only you can cool my desire. I'm on fire.

iceman,"Sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge. Baby, this emptiness has already been judged. I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got. You're a strange part of me, you're a preacher's girl. And I don't want no piece of this mechanical world. Got my arms open wide and my blood is runnin' hot. We'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door. And even the white angels of Eden with their flamin' swords. Won't be able to stop us from hittin' town in this dirty old Ford. Well it don't take no nerve when you got nothin to guard. I got tombstones in my eyes and I'm runnin' real hard. My baby was a lover and the world just blew her away. Once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right outta my head. But baby they didn't know that I was born dead. I am the Iceman, fightin' for the right to live. I say better than the glory roads of heaven, better off ridin'. Hellbound in the dirt, better than the bright lines of the freeway. Better than the shadows of your daddy's church. Better than the waiting, baby better off is the search."
if i should fall behind,We said we'd walk together baby come what may. That come the twilight should we lose our way. If as we're walkin a hand should slip free. I'll wait for you. And should I fall behind. Wait for me. We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side. We'd help each other stay in stride. But each lover's steps fall so differently. But I'll wait for you. And if I should fall behind. Wait for me. Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true. But you and I know what this world can do. So let's make our steps clear that the other may see. And I'll wait for you. If I should fall behind. Wait for me. Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead. There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed. Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees. I'll wait for you. And should I fall behind. Wait for me. Darlin' I'll wait for you. Should I fall behind. Wait for me.
if i was the priest,"Part of the Hammond demos.. (recorded by Allan Clarke on solo album in 1975) written by Bruce. Well there's a light on yonder mountain. And it's calling me to shine. There's a girl over by the water fountain. And she's asking to be mine. And ain't that Jesus, he's standing in the doorway. With a buckskin jacket, boots and spurs, so really fine. He says ""We need you up in Dodge City, son. 'Cause there's oh so many bad boys (just too many outlaw). Tryin' to work the same line"". Well now if Jesus was the sheriff and I were the priest. If my lady was an heiress and my mama was a thief. Oh and Papa rode shotgun for the Fargo line. There's still too many outlaws. Tryin' to work the same line. Now old sweet Virgin Mary. She runs the Holy Grail saloon. Where for a nickel they'll give you whisky. And the personally blessed balloon. And the Holy Ghost, he's the host with the most. He runs the burlesque show. Where they let you in for free. But oh hit you for your soul when you go. And Mary serves Mass on Sunday. And then she sells her body on Monday. To the bootlegger who will pay the highest price. But he don't know he got stuck with a loser. Mary's a stone junkie, what's more she's a boozer. And she's only been made once or twice. By some kind of magic. Well things ain't been the same in Heaven. Ever since big bad Bobby came to town. He's been known to down eleven. And then ask for another round. And me I got scabs on my knees. From kneeling way too long. I gotta take a stand, be the man, up where you belong. And forget about the old friends and the old times. Because there's just too many new boys. Tryin' to work the same line. Well now if Jesus was the sheriff and I were the priest. If my lady was an heiress and my mama was a thief. Oh and Papa rode shotgun for the Fargo line.

He tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street,. But they said, ""Johnny, it falls apart so easy and you know hearts these days are cheap."". And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a cheater."". Well, the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a liar."".

independence day,Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late. Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now. I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate. We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow. `Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us. There's a darkness in this town that's got us too. But they can't touch me now and you can't touch me now. They ain't gonna do to me what I watched them do to you. So say goodbye it's Independence Day. It's Independence Day all down the line. Just say goodbye it's Independence Day. It's Independence Day this time. Now I don't know what it always was with us. We chose the words and yeah we drew the lines. There was just no way this house could hold the two of us. I guess that we were just too much of the same kind. Well say goodbye it's Independence Day. All boys must run away come Independence Day. So say goodbye it's Independence Day. All men must make their way come Independence Day. Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint. And the highway she's deserted down to Breaker's Point. There's a lot of people leaving town now. Leaving their friends their homes. At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone. Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late. Nothing we can say can change anything now. Because there's just different people coming down here now. And they see things in different ways. And soon everything we've known will just be swept away. So say goodbye it's Independence Day. Papa now I know the things you wanted that you could not say. But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day. I swear I never meant to take those things away.

May your love give us love. May your strength give us strength. May your faith give us faith. May your hope give us hope. May your love give us love.

it's a shame,"Well I walk the way you want me to. And I'll talk the way you want me to. And I've tried to do all I can just to please you. Well I work hard every day for you. And I brought home all my pay for you. And I've cried my tears through the rain night and again. And oh whoa girl, it's a shame. Oh whoa girl, it's a doggone shame. We worked so hard, but it's all in vain. Oh whoa girl, it's a shame. Now I bought your gold and diamond rings. And I brought you home your pretty things. And I thought I'd shown all the love I had for you, yes I did. But as hard as I try it all falls through. Well maybe I was born to be just your fool. Trying to satisfy your every desire, each need you require. Well oh whoa girl, it's a shame. Oh whoa girl, it's a doggone shame. I worked so hard, but it's all in vain. Oh whoa girl, it's a shame. Someone now!. Whoa!. Whoaaa, whoa-hoo. Whoa. Oh whoa girl, it's a shame. Oh girl, it's a doggone shame. We worked so hard, but it's all in vain. Oh whoa girl, it's a shame.

it's hard to be a saint in the city,"I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra. I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova. I could walk like Brando right into the sun. Then dance just like a Casanova. With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet. Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat. When I strut down the street I could feel its heartbeat. The sisters fell back and said ""Don't that man look pretty"". The cripple on the corner cried out ""Nickels for your pity"". Them downtown boys sure talk gritty. It's so hard to be a saint in the city. I was the king of the alley I could talk some trash. I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash. I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool. A backstreet gambler with the luck to lose. And when the heat came down it was left on the ground. The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street. Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat. I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat. It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy. And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead. As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead. They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread. But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat. You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat. Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet. Then you're outa that hole and back up on the street. And them South Side sisters sure look pretty. The cripple on the corner cries out ""Nickels for your pity"". And them downtown boys sure talk gritty. It's so hard to be a saint in the city."
jack of all trades,"I'll mow your lawn, clean the leaves out your drain. I'll mend your roof to keep out the rain. I'll take the work that God provides. I'm a Jack of all trades, honey, we'll be alright. I'll hammer the nails, and I'll set the stone. I'll harvest your crops when they're ripe and grown. I'll pull that engine apart and patch her up 'til she's running right. I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright. A hurricane blows, brings a hard rain. When the blue sky breaks, feels like the world's gonna change. We'll start caring for each other like Jesus said that we might. I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright. The banker man grows fatter, the working man grows thin. It's all happened before and it'll happen again. It'll happen again, they'll bet your life. I'm a Jack of all trades and, darling, we'll be alright. Now sometimes tomorrow comes soaked in treasure and blood. Here we stood the drought, now we'll stand the flood. There's a new world coming, I can see the light. I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright. So you use what you've got, and you learn to make do. You take the old, you make it new. If I had me a gun, I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight. I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright. I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright"
jackson cage,Driving home she grabs something to eat. Turns a corner and drives down her street. Into a row of houses she just melts away. Like the scenery in another man's play. Into a house where the blinds are closed. To keep from seeing things she don't wanna know. She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street. The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat. In the Jackson Cage. Down in Jackson Cage. You can try with all your might. But you're reminded every night. That you been judged and handed life. Down in Jackson Cage. Every day ends in wasted motion. Just crossed swords on the killing floor. To settle back is to settle without knowing. The hard edge that you're settling for. Because there's always just one more day. And it's always gonna be that way. Little girl you've been down here so long. I can tell by the way that you move you belong to. The Jackson Cage. Down in Jackson Cage. And it don't matter just what you say. Are you tough enough to play the game they play. Or will you just do your time and fade away. Down into the Jackson Cage. Baby there's nights when I dream of a better world. But I wake up so downhearted girl. I see you feeling so tired and confused. I wonder what it's worth to me or you. Just waiting to see some sun. Never knowing if that day will ever come. Left alone standing out on the street. Till you become the hand that turns the key down in. Jackson Cage. Down in Jackson Cage. Well darlin' can you understand. The way that they will turn a man. Into a stranger to waste away. Down in the Jackson Cage.

Until the sun honey's torn from the sky. 'Til every fear you've felt burst free. And gone tumblin' down into the sea. Listen to me. CHORUS"
janey needs a shooter,"Well janey’s got a doctor who tears apart her insides.. He investigates her and he silently bates her sighs.

jazz musician,"Well it's Saturday night in New Jersey. And you're feeling kinda wet. Now the summer heat is getting you worried. So you try to look as innocent as you can as you sweat. And you've got a woman on the other side of the law. But it ain't cool to go see her yet. Because her ex-old man's a city cop. Who thinks he's auditioning for Dragnet. So you stand on the corner looking kinda torn. And in the Blue Light Lounge. Where death was born. The jazz musician blows his horn. You pop a letter to your baby in Richmond. 'Cause you're feeling pretty down. She's kinda small but at least she's a rich one. Oh, and she needs you real bad. And sometimes that's all that counts. You had a teenage band and flying hands. And oh, you was pretty big, you were pretty big in the. South. But you passed out on stage and flew into a rage. And someone tried to revive you. mouth to mouth. You felt a pain in your chest. As you passed the crown. And in the Blue Light Lounge. The lights went down. And the audience slipped silently out of town. Well now the atheist he burns you for laughing out loud. Because he can't understand what you're saying. And the word's out when they pushed him in the hole. Everybody knows that he went out praying. Oh, now the park is dark but the sidewalk's bright. And alive with the light of the living. Oh and mama can I walk you home tonight. 'Cause it's a big bad city. And this boy's got a lot for the givingI'm stranded in the jungle. First stage witness at a company killing. I'm clutching my high school diploma, shuffling my feet. Promised sixty bucks a week. And guaranteed top billing. Well you can live a life of love in New York. Only if you don't, if you don't love living. And I met this taxi driver who drives me around town. Telling tales of his back seat women. And out on the corner there's no room to move. 'Cause everybody's trying so hard to groove. And in the Blue Light Lounge. The jazz musician plays his blues."

jesus was an only son,"Jesus was an only son. As he walked up Calvary Hill. His mother Mary walking beside him. In the path where his blood spilled. Jesus was an only son. In the hills of Nazareth. As he lay reading the Psalms of David. At his mother's feet. A mother prays, ""Sleep tight, my child, sleep well. For I'll be at your side. That no shadow, no darkness, no tolling bell,. Shall pierce your dreams this night"". In the garden at Gethsemane. He prayed for the life he'd never live,. He beseeched his Heavenly Father to remove. The cup of death from his lips. Now there's a loss that can never be replaced,. A destination that can never be reached. A light you'll never find in another's face,. A sea whose distance cannot be breached. Well Jesus kissed his mother's hands. Whispered, ""Mother, still your tears,. For remember the soul of the universe. Willed a world and it appeared"

jungleland,"The rangers had a homecoming in Harlem late last night. And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine over the Jersey state line. Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge. Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain. The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants. Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down Flamingo Lane. Well the Maximum Lawman run down Flamingo chasing the Rat and the barefoot. girl. And the kids round here look just like shadows always quiet, holding hands. From the churches to the jails tonight all is silence in the world. As we take our stand down in Jungleland. The midnight gang's assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night. They'll meet `neath that giant Exxon sign that brings this fair city light. Man there's an opera out on the Turnpike. There's a ballet being fought out in the alley. Until the local cops, Cherry Tops, rips this holy night. The street's alive as secret debts are paid. Contacts made, they vanished unseen. Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades hustling for the record machine. The hungry and the hunted explode into rock'n'roll bands. That face off against each other out in the street down in Jungleland. In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage. Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the D.J. plays. Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners. Desperate as the night moves on, just a look and a whisper, and they're gone. Beneath the city two hearts beat. Soul engines running through a night so tender in a bedroom locked. In whispers of soft refusal and then surrender in the tunnels uptown. The Rat's own dream guns him down as shots echo down them hallways in the. night. No one watches when the ambulance pulls away. Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light. Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz. Between flesh and what's fantasy and the poets down here. Don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it all be. And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment. And try to make an honest stand but they wind up wounded, not even dead. Tonight in Jungleland."
just like fire would,"One night in a motel room. Eyes cast like steel. I drank the wine they had left on my table. I knew the morning was too far. I smoke my last cigarette. Stay only to defy. The night was dark and the land was cold. It's frozen right to the bone. And just like fire would, I burn up. Just like fire would. Just like fire would, I burn up. Five hundred miles I have gone today. Tomorrow it's five hundred more. Outside my window the world passes by. It's stranger than a dream. Just like fire would, I burn up. Just like fire would. Just like fire would, I burn up. I go to work and I earn my pay load. My sweat, it falls to the ground. I see you now but we may never meet again, child. The ice is hanging on the door. One night in a motel room. Eyes cast like steel. I drank the wine they had left on my table. I knew the morning was too far. Just like fire would, I burn up. Just like fire would. Just like fire would, I burn up"
kingdom of days,"With you I don't hear the minutes ticking by. I don't feel the hours as they fly. I don't see the summer as it wanes. Just a subtle change of light upon your face. Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away. This is our kingdom of days. I watch the sun as it rises and sets. I watch the moon trace its arc with no regrets. My jacket 'round your shoulders, the falling leaves. The wet grass on our backs as the autumn breeze drifts through the trees. Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away. This is our kingdom of days. This is our kingdom of days. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I do. You whisper ""then prove it, then prove it, then prove it to me baby blue"". And I count my blessings that you're mine for always. We laugh beneath the covers and count the wrinkles and the grays. Sing away, sing away, sing away, sing away. Sing away, sing away, my darling, we'll sing away. This is our kingdom of days. This is our kingdom of days. This is our kingdom of days. This is our kingdom of days. This is our kingdom of days"

Well baby the dreamers ..... They ride down the streets with death in their eyes. And the new world's defeat, baby, it eats your eyes. Come on, come on, let's go tonight. I said come on, come on, let's go tonight. Well a man .... And he lost his wife. He walks down the streets babe, with death in his eyes. Well everybody wants heaven. But nobody wants to die.

life itself,"We met down in the valley where the wine of love and destruction flowed. There in that curve of darkness where the flowers of temptation grow. I left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else. You felt so good to me baby, good as life itself. You were life itself, rushing over me. Life itself, the wind in black elms,. Life itself in your heart and in your eyes, I can't make it without you. I knew you were in trouble anyone could tell. You carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell. You squandered all your riches your beauty and your wealth. Like you had no further use for, for life itself. You were life itself, rushing over me. Life itself, the wind in black elms,. Life itself in your heart and in your eyes, I can't make it without you. Why do the things that we treasure most, slip away in time. Till to the music we grow deaf, to God's beauty blind. Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart?. Till we fall away in our own darkness, a stranger to our own hearts. And life itself, rushing over me. Life itself, the wind in black elms,. Life itself in your heart and in your eyes, I can't make it without you. So here's one for the road, here's one to your health and to. Life itself, rushing over me. Life itself, the wind in the black elms,. Life itself in your heart and in your eyes, I can't make it without you. Life itself, life itself, life itself..."
lift me up,"I don't need your answered prayers. Or the chains your lover wears. I don't need your rings of gold. Or the secrets that you hold. Lift me up, darling. Lift me up and I'll fall. With you lift me up. Let your love lift me up. I don't need your sacred vow. Or the promise tomorrow brings. There, behind the morning clouds. I'll take the faith the daylight brings. Lift me up, darling. Lift me up and I'll fall. With you lift me up. Let your love lift me up. When the morning bright. Lifts away this night. And the light above. We will find our love. We will find our love. Your skin, your hand upon my neck. This skin, your fingers on my skin. This kiss, this heartbeat, this breath. This heart, this heart, this wilderness. Lift me up, darling. Lift me up and I'll fall. With you lift me up. Let your love lift me up.."
light of day,"Well I've been out of the woods for six days and nights now. I'm a little hot wired and I'm feeling alright now. I got some money in my pocket and I won't need a ride now. I got a big cherry car and my baby by my side now. (chorus). Well I'm a little hot-wired but I'm feeling ok. And I got a little lost along the way. And I'm just around the corner from the light of day. Just around the corner from the light of day. Well driving 500 miles got 100 to go, yeah. I've got rock and roll music on the radio. I've got a brother on the rig who's from the Gulf Coast. He said the girls down there are really the most, yeah. (chorus). Well I got thrown out of work on the Kokomo. Don't ask me what I'm doing cause I don't know. He wasn't joking when he wrote me that letter. Things can't get worse so they got to get better. (chorus)."
linda let me be the one,"Midnight boys are outside. Scrapin' tears up off the street. Standing guard over the window. Where the lonely Linda sleeps. There's a kid named Eddie. Walks like an angel in defeat. The ashes of a romance come. Traces Linda's name in a seat. Calls. Linda will you let me be the one. Linda will you, hey let me be the one. Linda will you let me be the one. Linda will you let me be the one. In a room full of contenders. Shadow boxin', Eddie's strong. Till he drops through a feigned surrender. To the canvas draped in scarves. Stole from Linda's bedroom. The night he laid at her feet. And the midnight boys were wasted. Down on King Street. He calls out. Linda will you let me be the one. Linda will you, hey let me be the one. Linda will you let me be the one. Linda will you let me be the one. Midnight's base is St Mary's. Midnight boys hide from the rain. Stay with the stolen sisters. Till the streets are dry again. Talking fast cars and chrome parts. Different worlds and strange girls. Empty homes, busted hearts. And kneeling with Linda in the dark. Linda will you let me be the one. Linda will you, hey let me be the one. Linda will you let me be the one."
lion's den,"You broke my heart, tore it apart. Thought it was cute, thought it was smart. But now I'm back and I've got the strength of ten. So I got a message for you my friend. CHORUS:. I'm Daniel waitin' in the lion's den. Daniel waitin' for that lion to come. Daniel waitin' in the lion's den. Dum dum dee dum dum dee dee dum dum. That old lion's mean and long in the tooth. And like you, baby, he's out on the loose. Messin' hearts up time and time again. Well it's time for that messin' to end. (CHORUS). At night I hear you out prowling around. Tearing guys up, scaring 'em down. Now all that growling's gonna come to no end. 'Cause I m just biding my time, my little friend. (CHORUS)."
little girl so fine,"After the music had stopped. I still heard it playing. I moved a little closer to hear. The words she was saying. She said I'll never break your heart. I'll never try to fake it. My love is here for you. All you have to do is take it. Kisses sweeter than wine. My little girl so fine. The night seemed to say it was right. But could I believe her. My heart said, it's time to go. But my eyes wouldn't leave her. There's always somebody trying to break your heart. Somebody trying to take it. My little girl tried so hard. To help me make it. Kisses sweeter than wine. My little girl so fine. Oh, oh, oh, oh, sha la la. Oh, oh, sha la la. So fine. Oh, oh, oh, oh, sha la la. Oh, oh, sha la la. So fine. When we danced. I forgot everything and whispered. Hold me tight. Take a chance. On what tomorrow brings. Won't you be mine, be mine. Be mine tonight. We walked away laughing together. Into the night for ever and ever and ever. Now I know. I'll never break me baby's heart. I'll never try to fake it. I'll give her all my love. All she has to do is take it. Kisses sweeter than wine. My little girl so fine. Kisses sweeter than wine. My little girl so fine. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Kisses sweeter than wine. My little girl so fine. Oh, oh, oh, oh, sha la la. Oh, oh, sha la la. So fine."
little things that count,"She said we could just sleep together,. There'd be nothing wrong.. We could just hold each other with our clothes on.. I went to answer, I don't think we should.. Then I heard a voice say, yeah, I guess we could.. She kissed me lightly and said you know sometimes when you're down,. . It's the little things that count. It's the little things that count. It's the little things.... She said it was too late, I really shouldn't try to drive.. She unbuttoned my shirt and whispered just close your eyes.. Here, let me take your boots off, you know sometimes when your luck's run out. . It's the little things that count. It's the little things that count. It's the little things.... Bridge: Her dress rode lightly as she walked. Then she pulled the covers down.. (harmonica break). Well I was so dry, she held a water glass to my lips,. And the polish on her nail was chipped.. She said she had a boyfriend that I reminded her of.. His hair was the same muddy brown; she stuck her tongue in my mouth...."
little white lies,"We met on open streets where we both had no place to go. I remember how my heart beat when you said. ""Oh Billy I love you so"". Now, standing in the doorway. did you ever think that we could look this old. Victims of the little white lies that we told. We did not count tomorrows. we took what we could and ran. There was no time for sorrow. every place you went I held your hand. And when the night closed in. I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know. But they never whispered the little white lies that we told. It was so good at the start, nothing could ever pull it apart. Running hand in hand through the rain. but soon the heart break, soon the pain, girl. There were no cold denials, nobody really lied. It wasn't in the things we said, girl. just time spent, promises implied. And when it began to fall apart. eaten quietly away from the inside. Bit by bit by those little white lies. Hey!. Hey!. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey hey hey!. Now standing in the doorway. did you ever think, ever think that we could look this old. Victims of the little white lies that we told. Now lying here in the dark. did you ever think, ever think that we could be this cold. Just as cold as the little white lies that we told. Little white lies. Little white lies. Little white lies. Little white lies. Little white lies"
livin' in the future,"Livin' In The Future. A letter come blowin' in. On an ill wind. Somethin' 'bout me and you. Never seein' one another again. And what I knew had come. Stars struck deaf and dumb. Like when we kissed. That taste of blood on your tongue. Don't worry, darlin'. No baby, don't you fret. We're livin' in the future. And none of this has happened yet. Don't worry, darlin'. No baby, don't you fret. We're livin' in the future. And none of this has happened yet. Woke up election day. Sky's gunpowder and shades of grey. Beneath the dirty sun. I whistle my time away. Then just about sun down. You come walkin' through town. Your boot heels clickin' like. The barrel of a pistol spinnin' round. Don't worry, darlin'. No baby, don't you fret. We're livin' in the future. And none of this has happened yet. Don't worry, darlin'. No baby, don't you fret. We're livin' in the future. And none of this has happened yet. The earth it gave away. The sea rose towards the sun. I opened up my heart to you. It got all damaged and undone. My ship Liberty sailed away. On a bloody red horizon. The groundskeeper opened the gates. And let the wild dogs run. [Instrumental]. Alone I limp through town. A lost cowboy at sundown. Got my monkey on a leash. Got my ear tuned to the ground. My faith's been torn asunder. Tell me is that rollin' thunder. Or just the sinkin' sound. Of somethin' righteous goin' under. Don't worry, darlin'. No baby, don't you fret. We're livin' in the future. And none of this has happened yet. Don't worry, darlin'. No baby, don't you fret. We're livin' in the future. And none of this has happened yet. None of this has happened yet. None of this has happened yet. None of this has happened yet. None of this has happened yet. [Instrumental]. Na na na na, na na na na-na. Na na na na, na na na na-na. Na na na na, na na na na-na.

living on the edge of the world,"Early North Jersey industrial skyline. I'm an all-set cobra jet creepin' through the night time. Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a pay phone. This turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone. I'm living on the edge of the world. Tryin' to get my girl on the line. Livin' on the edge of the world. But I think it's just a waste of my time. Some jerk keeps breaking my connection, girl. 'Cause I'm living on the edge of the world. Living on the edge of the world. Radio, radio, hear my tale of heartbreak. New Jersey in the morning like a lunar landscape. Got a counter girl at the Exit 24 HoJo. Down past the refinery towers where the great black river flows. I'm living on the edge of the world. Tryin' to get back to you, girl. Living on the edge of the world. Tryin' to get a message through. I gotta make a connection, girl. Because I'm living on the edge of the world. Living on the edge of the world. Radio's jammed with gospel stations. Lost souls callin' long distance salvation. Hey mister deejay gotta hear my last prayer. It's a hey ho rock and roll, deliver me from nowhere. I'm living on the edge of the world. Tryin' to get back to you, girl. Living on the edge of the world. Tryin' to get a message through. I gotta make some connection, girl. Because I'm living on the edge of the world. Living on the edge of the world. Now my boss don't dig me 'cause he put me on the night shift. It takes me two hours to get back to where my baby lives. In the wee wee hours my mind gets hazy. Relay towers, won't you lead me to my baby. 'Neath the overpass the trooper hits his party lights switch. Good night, good luck, one, two powershift."
living proof,Well now on a summer night in a dusky room. Come a little piece of the Lord's undying light. Crying like he swallowed the fiery moon. In his mother's arms it was all the beauty I could take. Like the missing words to some prayer that I could never make. In a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused. Searching for a little bit of God's mercy. I found living proof. I put my heart and soul I put 'em high upon a shelf. Right next to the faith the faith that I'd lost in myself. I went down into the desert city. Just tryin' so hard to shed my skin. I crawled deep into some kind of darkness. Lookin' to burn out every trace of who I'd been. You do some sad sad things baby. When it's your you 're tryin' to lose. You do some sad and hurtful things. I've seen living proof. You shot through my anger and rage. To show me my prison was just an open cage. There were no keys no guards. Just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars. Well now all that's sure on the boulevard. Is that life is just a house of cards. As fragile as each and every breath. Of this boy sleepin' in our bed. Tonight let's lie beneath the eaves. Just a close band of happy thieves. And when that train comes we'll get on board. And steal what we can from the treasures of the Lord. It's been along long drought baby. Tonight the rain's pourin' down on our roof. Looking for a little bit of God's mercy. I found living proof.
local hero,"I was driving through my hometown. I was just kinda killin' time. When I seen a face staring out of a black velvet painting. From the window of the five and dime. I couldn't quite recall the name. But the pose looked familiar to me. So I asked the salesgirl ""Who was that man. Between the doberman and Bruce Lee?"". She said ""Just a local hero"". ""Local hero"" she said with a smile. ""Yeah a local hero he used to live here for a while"". I met a stranger dressed in black. At the train station. He said ""Son your soul can be saved"". There's a beautiful women nights of low livin'. And some dangerous money to be made. There's a big town 'cross the whiskey line. And if we turn the right card up. They make us boss the devil pays off. And them folks that are real hard up. They get their local hero. Somebody with the right style. They get their local hero. Somebody with just the right smile. Well I learned my job I learned it well. Fit myself with religion and a story to tell. First they made me the king then they made me pope. Then they brought the rope. I woke to a gypsy girl sayin' ""Drink this"". Well my hands had lost all sensation. These days I'm feeling all right. 'Cept I can't tell my courage from my desperation. From the tainted chalice. Well I drunk some heady wine. Tonight I'm layin' here. But there's something in my ear. Sayin' there's a little town just beneath the floodline. Needs a local hero. Somebody with the right style. Lookin' for a local hero. Someone with the right smile. Local hero local hero she said with a smile. Local hero he used to live here for a while. Lisa Lowell, backing vocals.

loose change,"Met her at a friendly little bar down along the coast. She said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast. Drove around for a while, smoked a few cigarettes. Took her back to my place, she slipped off her party dress. She sat for a while on the edge of the bed just talkin'. Loose change in my pocket. Loose change in my pocket. Pint of gin in my boot cuff, I'm drivin' for a drink and a dance. Sittin' on the next stool, miss a little time on her hands. Yeah I knew she was trouble, but trouble sure was lookin' fine. And when I pulled her close what I knew kinda slipped my mind. We lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling. Loose change in my pocket. Loose change in my pocket. I pour another drink, wait for the night to get through. Stars are burning in that black void so far away and blue. Now I'm sittin' at a red light I feel somethin' tickin' way down. The night's moving like a slow train crawling through this shithole town. Got my bags packed in the back and I'm tryin' to get going again. But red just goes to green and green goes red and then. Then all I hear's the clock on the dash tick-tocking. Loose change in my pocket. Loose change in my pocket."
loose ends,"We met out on open streets. When we had no place to go. I remember how my heart beat. When you said ""I love you so"". Then little by little.

Darling to say when. Now baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end. We didn't count tomorrows. We took what we had and baby we ran. There was no place for sorrow. Every place we went I held your hand. And when the night closed in. I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know. But oh no. It was like we held a noose. and baby without check. we pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks. each one waiting for the other. darling to say when. oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end.

lost in the flood,"The ragamuffin gunner is returnin' home like a hungry runaway. He walks through town all alone. He must be from the fort he hears the high school girls say. His countryside's burnin' with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide. The hit and run, plead sanctuary, `neath a holy stone they hide. They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection. Nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception. And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood. Sticker smiles sweet as gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud. And I said ""Hey gunner man that's quicksand, that's quicksand that ain't mud. Have you thrown your senses to the war or did you lose them in the flood?"". That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced. Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight. He rides `er low on the hip, on the side he's got Bound For Glory in red, white and blue flash paint. He leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him Jimmy The. Saint. Well the blaze and noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin' point. He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point. And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell. That is, nothin' left that you could sell. Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell. And he said ""Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil that's blood"". I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm. Or was he just lost in the flood?. Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air. Some storefront incarnation of Maria, she's puttin' on me the stare. And Bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hard ware. Everything stops, you hear five, quick shots, the cops come up for air. And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street. And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose but he gets blown right off his feet. And some kid comes blastin' round the corner but a cop puts him right away. He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish. Still breathing when I walked away. And somebody said ""Hey man did you see that? His body hit the street with. such a beautiful thud"". I wonder what the dude was sayin' or was he just lost in the flood?. Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up. I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?."
love of the common people,"Livin' on free food, tickets. Water in the milk from the hole in the roof. Where the rain came through. What can you do? hmm. Tears from little sister cryin'. 'Cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch. For the party to go. Oh, but you know she'll get by. She is livin' in the love of the common people. Smiles from the heart of the family man. Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love her just as much as she can, she can. It's a good thing you don't have the bus fare. It would fall through the hole in your pocket. And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground. A walking to town to find a job. Trying to keep your hands warm. But the hole in your shoe let the snow come through. And it chills to the bone, boy. You'd better go home where it's warm. Where you can live in the love of the common people. Smiles from the heart of the family man. Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love her just as much as she can, she can. Livin' on dreams ain't easy. But the closer the knit the tighter the fit. And the chills stay away. You take 'em in stride family pride. You know that faith is your foundation. And with a whole lotta love and a warm conversation. And plenty of prayer. Making you strong where you belong. Where you can live in the love of the common people. Smiles from the heart of the family man. Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love her just as much as she can, she can..."

mansion on the hill,"There's a place out on the edge of town, sir,. Risin' above the factories and the fields. Now, ever since I was a child, I can remember. That mansion on the hill. In the day you can see the children playing. On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel. Steel gates that completely surround, sir,. The mansion on the hill. At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride. Through the streets of a town so silent and still. Park on a back road along the highway side. Look up at that mansion on the hill. In the summer all the lights would shine. There'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time. Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields. Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill. Tonight down here in Linden Town. I watch the cars rushin' by, home from the mill. There's a beautiful full moon rising. Above the mansion on the hill."

marie,"Marie, she comes to me in the twilight. When the wind blows down across the river. So cold, the fishermen cry. She rapes me in a rage of rainbow violence. Till my bare nerves, they sing. Like the strings of a violin. And the room seeps into a savage silence. Soaked in colours, red as blood, blue as night. And Marie she skins me alive. Carves her initials in my side. Lures me with her purrs and cuts me with her knife. And the horses pound like thunder. They bolt like lightning on her range. She feels she's going under and she zeros in the rein. She's so strange. Well, Marie, you know, she's the queen of all the stallions. And I'm her prince of mules. And one of her principal fools. Marie, she's got the claws of a falcon. And she's perched on my shoulder, and slowly digging in. But she, oh she can be so strange sometimes. Like at night .... Or when the neighbors come to dine. Marie, she skins me alive. Burns her initials in my hide and then leaves me all alone. Branded to the bone. And my heart pounds like her horses. Oh, stampeding on the range. Marie knows all the sources. And she shoots me with her pain. And for her, I take it, Lord, down in my veins. And I watch her dance like some berserk fairy. All across the concrete prairies of Bleecker Street. Marie, she can be so strangeBut she's the only lonely cowgirl on my range."

my beautiful reward,Well I sought gold and diamond rings. My own drug to ease the pain that living brings. Walked from the mountain to the valley floor. Searching for my beautiful reward. Searching for my beautiful reward. From a house on a hill a sacred light shines. I walk through these rooms but none of them are mine. Down empty hallways I went from door to door. Searching for my beautiful reward. Searching for my beautiful reward. Well your hair shone in the sun. I was so high I was the lucky one. Then I came crashing down like a drunk on a barroom floor. Searching for my beautiful reward. Searching for my beautiful reward. Tonight I can feel the cold wind at my back. I'm flyin' high over gray fields my feathers long and black. Down along the river's silent edge I soar. Searching for my beautiful reward. Searching for my beautiful reward.
my best was never good enough,"'Every cloud has a silver lining, every dog has his day.. 'She said 'Now don't say nothin'. If you don't have something nice to say. The tough now they get going when the going gets. tough.'. But for you my best was never good enough. 'Now don't try for a home run baby. If you can get the job done with a hit. Remember a quitter never wins. And a winner never quits. The sun don't shine on a sleepin' dog's ass.'. And all the rest of that stuff. But for you my best was never good enough. 'If God gives you nothin' but lemons then you make some lemonade. The early bird catches the fuckin' worm,=20. Rome wasn't built in a day. Now life's like a box of chocolatesYou never know what you're going to get. Stupid is as stupid does' and the rest of that shit. Come on pretty baby call my bluff. 'Cause for you my best was never good enough."
my city of ruins,"There is a blood red circle. On the cold dark ground. And the rain is falling down. The church door's thrown open. I can hear the organ's song. But the congregation's gone. My city of ruins. My city of ruins. Now the sweet bells of mercy. Drift through the evening trees. Young men on the corner. Like scattered leaves,. The boarded up windows,. The empty streets. While my brother's down on his knees. My city of ruins. My city of ruins. Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!. Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!. Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!. Now's there's tears on the pillow. Darlin' where we slept. And you took my heart when you left. Without your sweet kiss. My soul is lost, my friend. Tell me how do I begin again?. My city's in ruins. My city's in ruins. Now with these hands,. With these hands,. With these hands,. I pray Lord. With these hands,. With these hands,. I pray for the strength, Lord. With these hands,. With these hands,. I pray for the faith, Lord. We pray for your love, Lord. We pray for the lost, Lord. We pray for this world, Lord. We pray for the strength, Lord. We pray for the strength, Lord. Come on. Come on. Come on, rise up. Come on, rise up. Come on, rise up. Come on, rise up. Come on, rise up. Come on, rise up. Come on, rise up. Come on, rise up. Come on, rise up."
my father's house,"Last night I dreamed that I was a child. Out where the pines grow wild and tall. I was trying to make it home through the forest. Before the darkness falls. I heard the wind rustling through the trees. And ghostly voices rose from the fields. I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path. With the devil snappin' at my heels. I broke through the trees, and there in the night. My father's house stood shining hard and bright. The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms. But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms. I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart. Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts. I got dressed, and to that house I did ride. From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light. I walked up the steps and stood on the porch. A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door. I told her my story, and who I'd come for. She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"". My father's house shines hard and bright. It stands like a beacon calling me in the night. Calling and calling, so cold and alone. Shining `cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned."
my hometown,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand. Into the bus stop. To pick up a paper for my old man. I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and. Steer as we drove through town. He'd tousle my hari and say son take a. good look around this is your hometown. This is your hometown. This is your hometown. This is your hometown. In '65 tension was running high, at my high school. There was a lot of fights between the black and white. There was nothing you could do. Two cars at light on a Saturday night,. In the back seat there wasa gun. Words were passed, in a shotgun blast. Troubled times had come, to my hometown. My hometown. My hometown. My hometown. Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores. Seems like there ain't nobody. Wants to come down here no more. They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks. Foreman says these jobs are going boys. And they ain't coming back to your hometown. Your hometown. Your hometown. Your hometown. Last night me and Kate we laid in bed talking about getting out. Packing up our bags and maybe heading south. I'm 35, we got a boy of our own now. Last night I sat him up, behind the wheel. And said son take a goold look around,. This is your hometown."
my love will not let you down,"At night I go to bed. But I just can't sleep. I got something runnin' around my head. Ooh that just won't keep. In the silence I hear my heart beatin'. Time slippin' away. I got a time bomb tickin' deep inside of me. Girl all I want to say. I keep searchin' for you darlin'. Searchin everywhere I go. And when I find you there's gonna be just one thing that you gotta know. One thing you gotta know. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. At night I walk the streets lookin' for romance. But I always end up stumblin' in a half trance. I search for a connection in some new eyes. That hardly protect you from too many dreams passed by. I see you standin, across the room watchin' me without a sound. I'm gonna push my way through that crowd. I'm gonna tear your holy walls down. Tear all your walls down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. Well hold still now darlin'. Hold still for God's sake. Cause I got me a promise. I ain't afraid to make (I ain't afraid to make). My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down. My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down."
my loverman,"You treated me hard and made my heart ache. I know you're only human, and men they make mistakes. Your life with her turned to black. And now you want our love back. Well come into my arms and fall, my lover man. Was it a gypsy's curse or a hex sign. Or was it just that simple thing that led you from these arms of mine. Oh yes, I've had the days. To grow used to your foolish ways. And what is it really, after all, my lover man. I can see the change in your eyes. There's no need to apologize. We stood at the wishing well. Our dreams like coins into the water fell. The water so cold and black. There was no going back. I don't mean to cause you hurt or cause you pain. Life is short and love's a dirty game. Now there's no need for our game to end. Come close and we'll begin. To find our beautiful selves again, my loverman. My loverman. My loverman."
my lucky day,In the room where fortune falls. On a day when chance is all. In the dark of this exile. I felt the grace of your smile. Honey you're my lucky day. Baby you're my lucky day. When I've lost all the other bets I've made. Honey you're my lucky day. I've seen strong hearts give way. To the burdens of the day. To the weary hands of time. Where fortune is not kind. Honey you're my lucky day. Baby you're my lucky day. When I've lost all the other bets I've made. Honey you're my lucky day. I have waited at your side. I've counted the tears you've cried. But to win darling we must pay. So don't hide your heart away. Honey you're my lucky day. Baby you're my lucky day. When I've lost all the other bets I've made. Honey you're my lucky day
my oklahoma home,"When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip,. I wanted a place to call my own.. And so I made the race, and staked me out a place,. And settled down along the Cimarron.. It blowed away, it blowed away,. My Oklahoma home, it blowed away.. It looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there,. But my Oklahoma home, it blowed away.. I planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats,. Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face.. Got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow. And got a fancy mortgage on the place.. It blowed away, it blowed away,. All the crops I planted blowed away.. You can't grow any grain if there isn't any rain;. All except the mortgage blowed away.. It blowed away my rooster and it blowed away my hens;. The pigs and cattle went astray.. All the crops that I sowed went a-foggin' down the road.. My Oklahoma farm, it blowed away.. It blowed away, it blowed away,. Everything I owned blowed away.. I hollered and I cussed when my land went up in dust,. When my Oklahoma farm, it blowed away.. It looked so green and fair, when I built my shanty there,. I figured I was all set for life.. I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest. And went to town and picked me out a wife.. She blowed away, she blowed away. My Oklahoma woman blowed away.. Just as I bent and kissed her, she was picked up by a twister;. My Oklahoma woman blowed away.. Then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan. Of the wind around the corners of my shack;. So I took off down the road when the south wind blowed,. A-travelin' with the wind at my back.. I blowed away, I blowed away. Chasin' a dust cloud up ahead.. Once it looked so green and fair, now it's up there in the air;. My Oklahoma farm is overhead.. Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam,. For Oklahoma dust is everywhere.. Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my chickens squawkin'. I can hear my wife a-talkin' in the air.. It blowed away, it blowed away,. My Oklahoma home blowed away.. But my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere,. My Oklahoma home that blowed away.. I'm a roamin' Oklahoman, but I'm always close to home. And I'll never get homesick 'til I die.. No matter where I'm found, my home is all around;. My Oklahoma home is in the sky.. It blowed away, it blowed away,. My farm down upon the Cimarron.. But all around the world, wherever dust is whirled,. Some is from my Oklahoma home.. It blowed away, it blowed away,. My Oklahoma home blowed away.. Oh it's up there in the sky in that dust cloud rolling by,. My Oklahoma home is in the sky."

Sheriff when the man pulls. That switch sir and snaps my poor neck back. You make sure my pretty baby. Is sittin' right there on my lap. They declared me unfit to live. Said into that great void my soul'd be hurled. They wanted to know why I did what I did. Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world.

night,"You get up every morning at the sound of the bell. You get to work late and the boss man's giving you hell. Till you're out on a midnight run. Losing your heart to a beautiful one. And it feels right as you lock up the house. Turn out the lights and step out into the night. And the world is busting at its seams. And you're just a prisoner of your dreams. Holding on for your life `cause you work all day. To blow `em away in the night. The rat traps filled with soul crusaders. The circuits lined and jammed with chromed invaders. And she's so pretty that you're lost in the stars. As you jockey your way through the cars. And sit at the light, as it changes to green. With your faith in your machine off you scream into the night. And you're in love with all the wonder it brings. And every muscle in your body sings as the highway ignites. You work nine to five and somehow you survive till the night. Hell all day they're busting you up on the outside. But tonight you're gonna break on through to the inside. And it'll be right, it'll be right, and it'll be tonight. And you know she will be waiting there. And you'll find her somehow you swear. Somewhere tonight you run sad and free. Until all you can see is the night."
night fire,"Now you're running with the right crowd. Well you better watch the friends you're choosing. Girl I know you're a walking winner now. But you better keep your eye on who's doing the loosing. All the faces staring down your throat. All the eyes, darling, that never closed. In your sadness, girl. maybe there's something that you ought to know. Night fire, the night fire is out in the dark burning. Night fire, the night fire is down in the street yearning. You're running with the right crowd. Money and the wine are flowing. You found a place with the right crowd. But you forgot about that storm, that storm that's blowing. (Dance on) Let the music play. (Dance on) Let the night roll to day. (Dance on) Don't listen to what they say. Just keep moving to the beat, to the beat, to the big beat. Night fire, the night fire is out in the dark burning. Night fire, the night fire is down in the street yearning. Well they punch your ticket as you grow old. Do you really get used to being bought and sold. Does a brand new dress keep out the cold. Do your brand new friends help you to keep. Your pretty eyes from seeing what they shouldn't see. The sound of breaking glass and running feet. The sound of breaking glass and running feet. Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know. Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know. Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know. Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know. Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know.

no money down,"As I was motorvatin' back in town. I saw a Cadillac sign, said: No money down. Eased on my brakes, I pulled in the drive. Gunned my motor twice, then I walked inside. Dealer came to me, said trade in your Ford. I'll put you in a car that'll eat up the road. Tell me what you want, just sign that line. I'm gonna have it brought down to you. In a hour's time. Now I'm gonna buy a car. I'm gonna be headin' on down that road. 'No money down'. I won't have to worry baby. About my broken and ragged Ford. Yes, I want a yellow convertible, two door Deville. With a continental spare, white chrome wheels. I want power steering, Lord, I want power brakes. I want a powerfull motor with a jet off-take. Air conditioned, automatic heat. A full Murphey bed in my back seat. Short wave radio, Tv and a phone. I gotta talk with my baby when I'm ridin' alone. Now I'm gonna buy a car. I'm gonna be headin' on down that road. 'No money down'. I won't have to worry baby. About my broken and ragged Ford. I want four carburetors, two straight exhausts. Burnin' aviation fuel, no matter what it costs. Railroad airhorns, I want a military spot. I want a five year guarantee on everything I got. Ten dollar deductibles, twenty dolar notes. Thirty dollar liability, that's all she wrote. Now I'm gonna buy a car. I'm gonna be headin' on down that road. 'No money down'. I won't have to worry baby. About my broken and ragged Ford"
no need,"She's a broken winged angel. Refugee from things her mama knew. And she's done everything the Bible say not to do. Well I don't know if she believes in Jesus. The good book, or even Satan you see. I'm just trying to get her to believe in me. Oh, 'cause when I see her face. No matter where I am I'm in the right place. And the girls I left behind. Oh, they never satisfied me, it's so true. But baby, baby, you do. She's the belle of Eighth Street. High society's midnight vamp. Oh, she's my queen and I'm her tramp. Yes she's a free falling flyer. And she flows whichever way that the wind blows. And she's the only woman I never knew. Who could teach me more about me, bind me in chains. And still let me be free. My heart swells up inside. Starts beating like I'm gonna die. And my body breaks in pain. As she falls down on me like the rain. It's only her and my songs that keep me from going insane. And I guess I'm one of those people. Who measures love in pain. You see, I never had too much personal success. And to me there's nothing sweeter. Than a teardrop of rain. I just love that feeling of sadness. Oh and it worries me so .... She's my West Side angel. She looks so funky in her Hollywood wing. And she knows how I stumble when I talk. So she says: ""Don't talk, babe, just sing"". And I have seen her body in candle glow. In the deep heart of the night. When you finally let loose of everything. Oh, and she loves me like such a good woman. And still, oh, she's just a sweet young thing. And I know this might sound crazy. or just the words of a young fool. But I swear I'd be on the floor. And she ever walked out the door. I swear I'd wish that she would shoot me first. And I know that sounds insane but sometimes I believe it's true. And that's what scares me worst. 'Cause I dance for her. Take any chance for her. And I play for her. Lord God knows I play for her. And I need for her. And I bleed for her."
no surrender,We busted out of class had to get away from those fools. We learned more from a three-minute record. That we ever learned in school. Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound. I can feel my heart begin to pound. You say you're tired and you just want to close. Your eyes and follow your dreams down. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrender. Now young faces grow sad and old and hearts. of fire grow cold. We swore blood brothers against the wind. I'm ready to grow young again. And hear yur sister's voice calling us home. Acroos the open yards. Believin' we could cut someplace of our own. With these drums and these guitars. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrender. Blood brother in the stormy night with a vow to defend. No retreat no surrender. Now on the street tonight the lights gro dim. The walls of my room are closing in. But it's good to see your smiling face. And to hear your voice again. We could sleep in the twilight. By the river bed. With a wide open country in our hearts. And these romantic dreams in our heads. Chorus:. We made a promise we swore we'd always remember. No retreat no surrender. Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow. to defend. No retreat no surrende
none but the brave,"Tonight down on Union Street. I'm thinkin' back, baby, to you and me. To the way you used to be. And your words come back to me. From passing cars. Their voices sing out. In empty bars where guitars ring out. We'd be the lucky one to get out. You said, None baby but the brave. No one baby but the brave. Oh strong enough to save something. From what they gave. None baby but the brave. No one baby but the brave. Now in dreams these nights I see you my friend. The way you were back then. Ah, on a night like this. I know that girl no longer exists. Except for a moment in some stranger's eyes. Or in a nameless girl. In cars rushin' by. That's where I find you tonight. And in my heart it still survives. To none, baby, but the brave. No one baby but the brave. Oh strong enough to save. Something from the love they gave. Yeah, none baby but the brave. No one baby but the brave. Now tonight once more I search. Every face on that crowded floor. Looking for I don't know what for. Something that ain't there no more. There's a girl standin' by the band. She reminds me of you. And I asked her to danceAs the drummer counts his play. I take her hand and we move away. And tonight, now I'll see old friends. caught in things they got no chance to win. Just gettin' beaten, and then playin' again. 'Till their strength gives out. Or their hearts give in. Who's that man who thinks. he can decide whose dreams will live. And who(se) shall be pushed aside. Did he ever walk down this streets at night. And looked into the eyes. Baby, of none, baby, but the brave. No one baby but the brave. No, none baby but the brave. No one baby but the brave. No one baby,no one but the brave."
nothing man,"I don't remember how I felt. I never thought I'd live. To read about myself. In my hometown paper. How my brave young life. Was forever changed. In a misty cloud of pink vapor. Darlin' give me your kiss. Only understand. I am, the nothing man. Around here, everybody acts the same. Around here, everybody acts like nothing's changed. Friday night, the club meets at Al's Barbecue. The sky's still, the same unbelievable blue. Darlin' give me your kiss. Come and take my hand. I am, the nothing man. You can call me Joe. Buy me a drink and shake my hand. You want courage. I'll show you courage you can understand. The pearl and silver. Restin' on my night table. It's just me Lord, pray I'm able. Darlin, with this kiss. Say you understand. I am, the nothing man. I am, the nothing man."

One day when Jesus was praying to the masses. Lazarus passed away.. Mary she lost faith. She got sick at the heart. She didn't believe. Jesus came back. He told Mary, ""Don't you weep...

one step up,Woke up this morning my house was cold. Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'. Went out and hoped in my old Ford. Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'. We've given each other some hard lessons lately. But we ain't learnin'. We're the same sad story that's a fact. One step up and two steps back. Bird on a wire outside my motel room. But he ain't singin'. Girl in white outside a church in June. But the church bells they ain't ringing. I'm sitting here in this bar tonight. But all I'm thinkin' is. I'm the same old story same old act. One step up and two steps back. It's the same thing night on night. Who's wrong baby who's right. Another fight and I slam the door on. Another battle in our dirty little war. When I look at myself I don't see. The man I wanted to be. Somewhere along the line I slipped off track. I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back. There's a girl across the bar. I get the message she's sending. Mmm she ain't lookin' to married. And me well honey I'm pretending. Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms. The music was never-ending. We danced as the evening sky faded to black. One step up and two steps back
one way street,"If the sun should fall from the skytomorrow. If the rain brings the tears to your eye, I would share your sorrow. But you must go if you can't take the heat, our love was fine, our love was sweet. But we was walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street. Well I'm not with all those guys, who rode out in your eyes. Sometimes, ya sometimes, I can't forget your lines. But hold the train, just come today, and for your wrong, well you must pay. And we're walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street. If I'm old my darlin' eye, I must confess. That this can't be love, no I must be a man possessed. When I look in your eyes so bright, your walkin' and your dress fits you just right. But we were walkin' on a dead end, runnin' down a one way street. Well their's a man, could change the things, he feels inside. If for once I, could turn and make it swallow some of my pride. But for the wrongs, oh yes we must pay, so its bye bye baby today. And we'll go walkin' on that wildside, runnin' down a one way street. Yeah when I think, of all the girls, that I have I missed. Well I know I, would give them up, for just one kiss. That's nn..we, we are the same kind, and to leave you baby, I have to go blind. Oh when we're walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street.

open all night,"Well, I had the carburetor, baby, cleaned and checked. With her line blown out she's hummin' like a turbojet. Propped her up in the backyard on concrete blocks. For a new clutch plate and a new set of shocks. Took her down to the carwash, check the plugs and point. Well, I'm goin' out tonight. I'm gonna rock that joint. Early north Jersey industrial skyline. I'm a all-set cobra jet creepin' through the nighttime. Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a pay phone. This turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone. Gotta hit the gas, baby. I'm running late. This New Jersey in the mornin' like a lunar landscape. Now, the boss don't dig me, so he put me on the night shift. It's an all-night run to get back to where my baby lives. In the wee, wee hours your mind gets hazy. Radio relays towers, won't you lead me to my baby?. Underneath the overpass, trooper hits his party light switch. Good night, good luck. One, two power shift. I met Wanda when she was employed. Behind the counter at Route Sixty Bob's Big Boy Fried Chicken. On the front seat, she's sittin' in my lap. We're wipin' our fingers on a Texaco road map. I remember Wanda up on scrap metal hill. With them big brown eyes that make your heart stand still. Well, at five a.m., oil pressure's sinkin' fast. I make a pit stop, wipe the windshield, check the gas. Gotta call my baby on the telephone. Let her know that her daddy's comin' on home. Sit tight, little mama, I'm comin' `round. I got three more hours, but I'm coverin' ground. Your eyes get itchy in the wee, wee hours. Sun's just a red ball risin' over them refinery towers. Radio's jammed up with gospel stations. Lost souls callin' long distance salvation. Hey, mister deejay, won'tcha hear my last prayer?. Hey, ho, rock'n'roll, deliver me from nowhere."

out of work,"8 a.m. I'm up and my feet beating on the sidewalk. Down at the unemployment agency, all I get is talk. I check the want ads but there just ain't nobody hiring. What's a man supposed to do when he's down and he's. Out of work. I need a job, I'm out of work. I'm unemployed, I'm out of work. I need a job, I'm out of work. I go to pick my girl up. Her name is Linda Brown. Her dad invites me in. He tells me to sit down. The small talk that we're making. Is going pretty smooth. But then he drops a bomb. ""Son, what d'ya do ?"". I'm out of work. I need a job, I'm out of work. I'm unemployed, I'm out of work. I need a job, I'm out of work. Hey Mr President I know you got your plans. You're doing all you can now to aid the little man. We got to do our best to whip that inflation down. Maybe you got a job for me just driving you around. I'm out of work. These hard times, they're enough. To make a man lose his mind. I'm out of work. Up there you got a job but down here below. I'm out of work. I need a job, I'm out of work. I'm unemployed, I'm out of work. I need a job, I'm out of work. I'm out of work. I'm out of work.

outlaw pete,"He was born a little baby on the Appalachian Trail. At six months old he'd done three months in jail. He robbed a bank in his diapers and little bare baby feet. All he said was ""Folks my name is Outlaw Pete"". I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?. At 25 a Mustang pony he did steal. And he rode her 'round and 'round on heaven's wheel. Father Jesus I'm an outlaw, killer and a thief. And I slow down only to sow my grief. I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?. He cut his trail of tears across the countryside. And where he went women wept and men died. One night he awoke from a vision of his own death. Saddled his pony and rode out deep into the West. Married a Navajo girl and settled down on the res.. And as the snow fell he held their beautiful daughter to his chest. I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?. Out of the East on an Irish stallion came bounty hunter Dan. His heart quickened and burdened by the need to get his man. He found Pete peacefully fishing by the river. Pulled his gun and got the drop. He said ""Pete you think you've changed but you have not"". He cocked his pistol pulled the trigger and shouted, ""Let it start"". Pete drew a knife from his boot, threw it,. And pierced Dan through the heart. Dan smiled as he lay in his own blood dying in the sun. Whispered in Pete's ear ""We cannot undo these things we've done"". You're Outlaw Pete, You're Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?. For forty days & nights Pete rode and did not stop. Till he sat high upon an icy mountaintop. He watched a hawk on a desert updraft, slip & slide. Moved to the edge and dug his spurs deep into his pony's side. Some say Pete and his pony vanished over the edge. And some say they remain frozen high up on that icy ledge. A young Navajo girl washes in the river, her skin so fair. And braids a piece of Pete's buckskin chaps into her hair. Outlaw Pete, Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?"

over the rise,"I walk along the levee to see the gypsy man. The dirt 'neath my feet baby's turnin' to quicksand. He looked into my palm, then looked me in the eye. And told me you were gone, gone over the rise. Once we stood together at the wishing well. Our wishes like dreams, baby, into the water fell. Oh then I kissed your lips but when I looked into your eyes. They were gone, gone over the rise. Tonight the blackbirds fly low on the water's edge. Oh we walked this path not knowing where it led. Now at the bottom of the river deep lies something shiny and golden. Is a promise that love couldn't keep same as a promise broken*. Well I woke last night to the sound of rain. The wind rustling branches against the window pane. I searched the pillow beside me for the tears we cried. Baby they were gone, gone over the rise."
paradise,"Where the river runs to black. I take the schoolbooks from your pack. Plastics, wire and your kiss. The breath of eternity on your lips. In the crowded marketplace. I drift from face to face. I hold my breath and close my eyes. I hold my breath and close my eyes. And I wait for paradise. And I wait for paradise. The Virginia hills have gone to brown. Another day, another sun goin' down. I visit you in another dream. I visit you in another dream. I reach and feel your hair. Your smell lingers in the air. I brush your cheek with my fingertips. I taste the void upon your lips. And I wait for paradise. And I wait for paradise. I search for you on the other side. Where the river runs clean and wide. Up to my heart the waters rise. Up to my heart the waters rise. I sink 'neath the river cool and clear. Drifting down I disappear. I see you on the other side. I search for the peace in your eyes. But they're as empty as paradise. They're as empty as paradise. I break above the waves. I feel the sun upon my face"

pilgrim in the temple of love,"It was Christmas Eve, I was standin' in the parking lot. of ""Fabulous Girls, Nude - Nude - Nude"". In the car next to me there was a young lady givin' a blow-job. to a man in a Santa Claus suit. His beard was crooked, his hat askew. Embarrassed, I turned to go. When from the back seat of that Mazda I heard somebody shout ""Oh Baby, don't. stop"". And a merry ""Ho-ho-ho"". When I walked inside, I ordered a beer and a double shot of whisk. And in three minutes I had fallen in love. The DJ announced ""Ladies and gentlemen, from Forth Worth, Texas: Lady Godiva"". And I sat and worshipped 'neath the angel above. At the end of her set she brushed her hair. Came and sat on the stool to my right. And said ""Will you buy me a drink?"". My heart beats fast, my trousers grew tight. And wittily I replied ""Uhhh...."". She showed me a picture of her kid. Said during the day she's an art student. She dances six nights a week for slobs and idiots like this. Of course, present company excluded.. On Donner, on Dancer, on Comet, on Blitzen. I'm lost in the valley of the supervixens. Worshippin' at the feet of the goddess above. I'm a pilgrim in the temple of love, ma, just a pilgrim in the temple. of love. Well then Santa came stumblin' in, and somebody shouted. ""Hey Santa, where's your elves?"". He sat down on the stool to my left. And the bartender took a vodka bottle of the shelf. He asked if Mrs. Claus had called. To tell her he worked on the late shift at the mall. And he was sorry, but he just got through. I turned and I asked him:. ""How's the kid this year, Santa?"". Beneath his breath he whispered ""A merry fuck you"". Well then the owner come over and he was a short gfat ugly guy. With a funny kind of pushed-in face. He shook my hand and said it was the first time. They'd ever had a real superstar in this place. Lady Godiva bought me a few drinks. And words came out of my mouth. What they were, I couldn't guess. But it was something about showgirls, lapdancing, motley crue. You can guess the rest. Well I walked outside, snow was falling. I had some toys to put together - it was Christmas time. Santa followed me into the parking lot. And threw up on the hood of the car next to mine. I gave him my handkerchief, pulled out onto the highway. And as I sat at the light. I swear I saw a sleigh with a dozen of reindeers. Pull up out of the parking lot and cut across the mall. And a voice shouted ""Merry Christmas to all you assholes. and to all a good fucking night!""."

There ain't no secret about that. Well come on over here and hug me. And, baby, I'll spill the facts. Well, honey it ain't your money. Cause baby I got plenty of that.

Honey, I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac. Pink Cadillac. Well now way back in the Bible, temptations always come along. There's always somebody tempting you. Somebody into doing something they know is wrong. Well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold. And they tempt you with the pleasures that the flesh does surely hold. They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple. Man I ain't going for that. I know it was her pink Cadillac. Crushed velvet seats. Riding in the back, oozing down the street. Waving to the girls. Feeling out of sight. Spending all my money on a Saturday night. Honey, I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac. Now some folks say it's too big and uses too much gas. Some folks say it's too old and that it goes too fast. But my love is bigger than a Honda, it's bigger than a Subaru. Hey man there's only one thing and one car that will do. Anyway we don't have to drive it honey, we can park it out in back. And have a party in your pink Cadillac."

Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be. We were standin' at the bar it was hard to hear. The band was playin' loud and you were shoutin' somethin' in my ear. You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four. You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor. You just stood there and held me, then you started dancin' slow. And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go. Well I saw you last night down on the avenue. Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you. You were standin' in the doorway out of the rain. You didn't answer when I called out your name. You just turned, and then you looked away like just another stranger waitin' to get blown away. Point blank, right between the eyes. Point blank, right between the pretty lies you fell. Point blank, shot right through the heart.

queen of the supermarket,"There's a wonderful world where all you desire. And everything you've longed for is at your fingertips. Where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips. Where aisles and aisles of dreams await you. And the cool promise of ecstasy fills the air. At the end of each working day she's waiting there. I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. As the evening sky turns blue. A dream awaits in aisle number two. With my shopping cart I move through the heart. Of a sea of fools so blissfully unaware. That they're in the presence of something wonderful and rare. The way she moves behind the counter. Beneath her white apron her secrets remain hers. As she bags the groceries, her eyes so bored. And sure she's unobserved. I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. There's nothing I can say. Each night I take my groceries and I drift away. And I drift away. With guidance from the gods above. At night I pray for the strength to tell the one I love. I love I love I love her so. I take my place in the checkout line. For one moment her eyes meet mine. And I'm lifted up, lifted up, lifted up, lifted up. I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. Though a company cap covers her hair. Nothing can hide the beauty waiting there. The beauty waiting there. I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket. I'm in love with the Queen of the Supermarket. As I lift my groceries into my car. I turn back for a moment and catch a smile. That blows this whole fucking place apart. I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket"
racing in the street,"I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396. Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor. She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot. Outside the Seven-Eleven store. Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch. And he rides with me from town to town. We only run for the money got no strings attatched. We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down. Tonight tonight the strip's just right. I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat. Summer's here and the time is right. We're goin' racin' in the street. We take all the action we can meet. And we cover all the northeast state. When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street. From the fire roads to the interstate. Some guys they just give up living. And start dying little by little piece by piece. Some guys come home from work and wash up. Then go rain' in the street. Tonight tonight the strip's just right. I wanna blow 'em all out of their seats. Calling out around the world. We're going racin' in the street. I met her on the strip three years ago. In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.. I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away. But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes. And she cries herself to sleep at night. When I come home the house is dark. She sighs ""Baby did you make it all right"". She sits on the porch of her daddy's house. But all her pretty dreams are torn. She stares off alone into the night. With the eyes of one who hates for just being born. For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels. Rumbling through this promised land. Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea. And wash these sins off our hands. Tonight tonight the highway's bright. Out of our way mister you best keep. 'Cause summer's here and the time is right. We're goin' racin' in the street."
radio nowhere,"Radio Nowhere. I was tryin' to find my way home. But all I heard was a drone. Bouncing off a satellite. Crushin' the last lone American night. This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?. This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?. I was spinnin' 'round a dead dial. Just another lost number in a file. Dancin' down a dark hole. Just searchin' for a world with some soul. This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?. This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?. Is there anybody alive out there?. I just want to hear some rhythm. I just want to hear some rhythm. I just want to hear some rhythm. I just want to hear some rhythm. I want a thousand guitars.

But there was just time when I asked for too much.. She sighed because she could not give it.. We used to sit beneath the tree just the lady, the radio man and me.. And I think it was the winter of ’63 the man went away and let us be. It was early on an august day that the lady decided she must go away.. Her heart it seems could not pay the price for what her body was buying. I came home from school and I found the note went into the kitcken. And lit the old stone with songs set on overload.. I turned on the tv, spent the rest of the sfternoon watching. All my cartoons thru the hall. And across the porch was the sun surrendered like a crying torch."

reason to believe,"Seen a man standin' over a dead dog lyin' by the highway in a ditch. He's lookin' down kinda puzzled pokin' that dog with a stick. Got his car door flung open he's standin' out on Highway 31. Like if he stood there long enough that dog'd get up and run. Struck me kinda funny seem kinda funny sir to me.

She said ""Baby I'll work for you every day and bring my money home to you"". One day he up and left her and ever since that. She waits down at the end of that dirt road for young Johnny to come back. Struck me kinda funny seemed kind of funny sir to me. How at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe. Take a baby to the river Kyle William they called him. Wash the baby in the water take away little Kyle's sin. In a whitewash shotgun shack an old man passes away. Take his body to the graveyard and over him they pray. Lord won't you tell us tell us what does it mean. Still at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe. Congregation gathers down by the riverside. Preacher stands with his Bible groom stands waitin' for his bride. Congregation gone and the sun sets behind a weepin' willow tree. Groom stands alone and watches the river rush on so effortlessly. Lord and he's wonderin' where can his baby be. Still at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe."

remember when the music,Remember when the music. Came from wooden boxes. Strung with silver wires. And as we sang. The words would set our hearts on fire. To believe in things. So we'd sing. Remember when the music. Brought us all together. To stand inside the rain. And as we'd join hands. We'd meet in the refrain. With dreams to live. And hope to give. Remember when the music. Was the best that we'd dream of. For our's children's time. And as we'd worked we'd sing. Cause we knew time. Was just a lie. A gift to say. A gift that future gave. Remember when the music. Was a rock we could cling to. So we would not despair. And as we sang we'd knew. We'd hear an echo in the air. And if we weren't smiling then. We'd smile again. And all the times I listened. And all the times I heard. And all the melodies I'm missing. And all the magic words. All the beautiful words. All the beautiful voices. And all the choices we had thenI hope you find you got. Those kind of choices once again. Remember when the music. Brought the night. Across the valley. And as we hum the melody. We'd be safe within the sound. So we'd sleep. To awake with dreams. And promises to keep.

She unbuckled my belt, pulled back her hair. And sat in front of me on the bed. She said, ""Honey, how's that feel. Do you want me to go slow?"". My eyes drifted out the window. And down to the road below. I felt my stomach tighten. As the sun bloodied the sky. And sliced through hotel blinds. I closed my eyes. Sunlight on the Amatitlan. Sunlight streaming through your hair. In the Valle de dos Rios. The smell of mock orange filled the air. We rode with the vaqueros. Down into cool rivers of green. I was sure the work and the smile coming out 'neath your hat. Was all I'll ever need. Somehow all you ever need's. Never quite enough you know. You and I, Maria, we learned it's so. She slipped me out of her mouth. ""You're ready,"" she said. She took off her bra and panties. Wet her fingers, slipped it inside her. And crawled over me on the bed. She bought me another whisky. Said ""here's to the best you ever had"". We laughed and made a toast. It wasn't the best I ever had. Not even close"

roulette,"We left the toys out in the yard. I took my wife and kids and left my home unguarded. We packed what we could into the car. No one here knows how it started. But suddenly everything was just so out of control. Now I want some answers, mister, I need to know. I hear all the talk but I don't know what you're sayin'. But I think I got a good idea of the game that you're playin'. Roulette, that's the name now. Roulette, that's the game now. Roulette, I don't believe what they're sayin'. Roulette, and everybody's playin'. I grew up here on this street where nothin' moves, just a strange breeze. In a town full of worthless memories there's a shadow in my backyard. I've got a house full of things that I can't touch. Well all those things they won't do me much good now. I was a fireman out at Riker's, I did my job. Mister, I've been cheated, I feel like I've been robbed. I'm the big expendable, my life's just canceled, null and void. But what are you gonna do about your new boy. Roulette, you're playin' with my life. Roulette, with my kids and my wife. Roulette, every day the stakes get bigger. Roulette, a different finger on the trigger. Down by the river that talks the night speaks in searchlights. And shortwave radio squawk, the police patrol the streets. But I've left behind the man I used to be, everything he believed in and all that belonged to me. I tried to find my way out to somewhere where I thought it'd be safe. They stopped me at the roadblock they put up on the interstate. They put me in detention but I broke loose and then I ran. They said they want to ask me a few questions but I think they had other plans. Now I don't know who to trust and I don't know what I can believe. They say they want to help me but with the stuff they keep on sayin'. I think those guys just wanna keep on playin'. Roulette, with my life. Roulette, with my kids and my wife. Roulette, the bullet's in the chamber. Roulette, who's the unlucky stranger. Roulette, surprise, you're dead. Roulette, the gun's to your head. Roulette, the bullet's spinning in the chamber. Roulette, pull the trigger, feel the click. No further danger."
sad eyes,"Every day here you come walking. I hold my tongue, I don't do much talking. You say you're happy and you're doin' fine. Well go ahead baby, I got plenty of time. Sad eyes never lie.

Sad eyes never lie. Sad eyes never lie"
santa ana,">From a tin roof top. The little boy did watch. The procession down through town. Through the museum. Where Daniel walked with the Devil. With them boys from the Underground. Where the giants of science. Fight for tight control. Over the wild lands of New Mexico. Sam Houston's ghost's in Texas. Fighting for his soul. And the town folks rest uneasy. Beneath the guns of Kid Cole. And the Kid says: ""Hey, where's Santa Ana. He who could romance the dumb into talking. Take a chance with me tonight my Contessa,. If it don't work out, I ain't lame, I can walk"". Now some folks they just can't take it. To the streets of this town. But Sam easily can, and he lays his money down. Them cats in from the canyon. Strut their stuff in town. But there's only secret sinners here. Lord, there's only secret thieves. Only a fool would try to save. What the desert chose to leave. And now, hey there Senorita,. With your playboys in their Spanish bandanas. French cream won't soften them bullets baby. French kisses will not break your heart. Oh, painted night, set free with light. Glows outside the Rainbow Saloon. Match embraces with a Spanish lady. Beneath a graduation moon. No more colleges, no more coronations. Some punk's idea of a teenage nation. Has forced Santa Ana to change his stationFrom soldier to cartoon. And the giants of science. Spend their days and nights. Not with wives, not with lovers. But searching for the lights. They started in the desert on their helicopter flights. Just to be lost in the dust and the night. Ah, hey my Contessa. In your juke joint rides. You always bring candy for the kids. Come waltz with me tonight Senorita. 'Cause only fools are alone on a night like this."

silver palomino,"A mother dies, leaving her young son to come to terms with the loss. In remembrance of Fiona Chappel, for her sons Tyler and Oliver.. I was barely 13 years old. She came out of the Guadalupe's on a night so cold. Her coat was frosted diamonds in the sallow moon's glow. My silver palomino. Sixteen hands from her withers to the ground. I lie in bed and listen to the sound. Of the west Texas thunder roll. My silver palomino. I track her into the mountains she loved. Watch her from the rocks above. She'd dip her neck and drink from the winter flows. My silver palomino. Our mustaneros were the very best, sir. But they could never lay a rope on her. No corral will ever hold. The silver palomino. In my dreams bareback I ride. Over the pradera low and wide. As the wind sweeps out the draw. 'Cross the scrub desert floor. I'd give my riata and spurs. If I could be forever yours. I'd ride into the serrania where no one goes. For my silver palomino. Summer drought come hard that year. Our herd grazed the land so bare. Me and my dad had to blowtorch the thorns off the prickly pear. And mother, your hand slipped from my hair. Tonight I wake early the sky is pearl, the stars aglow. I saddle up my red roan. I ride deep into the mountains along a ridge of pale stone. Where the air is still with the coming snow. As I rise higher I can smell your hair. The scent of your skin, mother, fills the air. 'Midst the harsh scrub pine that grows. I watch the silver palomino. Mustaneros: Mustangers. Pradera: Prairie. Riata: Rope. Serrania: Sierra. Prickly Pear: Cactus"
sinaloa cowboys,"Miguel came from a small town in northern Mexico. He came north with his brother Luis to California three years ago. They crossed at the river Levee when Luis was just 16.

For everything the north gives it exacts a price in return.. ""They worked side by side in the orchards. From morning till the day was thru. Doing the work the hueros wouldn't. Word was out some men in from Sinaloa were looking for some hands. Well deep in Fresno county there was a deserted chicken ranch. There was a small tin shack on the edge of a ravine. Miguel and Luis stood cooking methamphetamine. You could spend a year in the orchards. Or make half as much in one ten-hour shift. Working for the men from Sinaloa. But if you slipped the Hydriodic acid. Could burn right thru your skin. They'd leave you spittin' up blood in the desert. If you breathed those fumes in. It was early one winter evening as Miguel stood watch outside. When the shack exploded lighting up the valley night. Miguel carried Luis' body over his shoulder down a swale. To the creekside and there in the tall grass Luis Rosales died. Miguel lifted Luis' body into his truck and then he drove. To where the morning sunlight fell on a eucalyptus grove. There in the dirt he dug up 10000 dollars all that they'd saved. Kissed his brother's lips and placed him in his grave."

Someday we'll be together. And the night will fall around us. This love will last forever. Someday we'll be together. Together. I can't sleep so I lay awake listenin' to the sounds of the city below.

something in the night,"I'm riding down Kingsley,. figuring I'll get a drink. Turn the radio up loud,. so I don't have to think,. I take her to the floor,. looking for a moment when the world seems right,. And I tear into the guts,. of something in the night.. You're born with nothing,. and better off that way,. Soon as you've got something the send. someone to try and take it away,. You can ride this road 'till dawn,. without another human being in sight,. Just kids wasted on. something in the night.. Nothing is forgotten or forgiven,. when it's your last time around,. I got stuff running around 'round my head. That I just can't live down. When we found the things we loved,. They were crushed and dying in the dirt.. We tried to pick up the pieces,. And get away without getting hurt,. But they caught us at the state line,. And burned our cars in one last fight,. And left us running burned and blind,. Chasing something in the night.."
song to the orphans,"The moltitude assembled and tried to make the noise. The black blind poet generals. and restless loud white boys. But time grew thin and the axis. Was left somehow incomplete. Where instead of child lions. We found aging junkie sheep. How many wasted have I seen signed ""Hollywood or bust"". Left to ride them ever ghostly Arizona gusts. Oh, cheerleader tramps and kids with big amps. Sounding in the void. High society vamps and ex-heavyweight champs. Mistaking soot for soil. So break me now Big Mama. As Old Faithful breaks the day. Believe me, my good Linda,. The aurora will shine your way. The Confederacy, she's in my name now. And the hounds are held at bay. The axis needs a stronger arm. Do you feel your muscles play?. The doorstep blanket weaver. Madonna she's pushing bells. From house to house to house to house. Giving last kisses and wishing well. To every gypsy, mystic and all star hero. That the kids might find the place. Who've been lost forever to papa and mama. On their weekends out in space. Now the sons they search for fathers. But their fathers have all gone. The lost souls search for saviors. But saviours don't last long. Those aimless, questionless renegade brats. Who live their lives in songs. They run the length of a candle. In a goodnight whisper and a puff they're gone. So break me now Big Mama. As Old Faithful breaks the day. Believe me, my good Linda,. The aurora will shine your way. The Confederacy, she's in my name now. And the hounds are held at bay. The axis needs a stronger arm. Do you feel your muscles play?. The missions are filled with hermits looking for a friend. The terraces are filled with cat-men looking for a way in. There are orphans junked on silver mountains. Lost in celestial alleyways. They wait for that old tramp Dog Man Moses. He takes in all the strays. ""Now, don't grow on empty legends. or lonely cradle songs. 'Cause Billy The Kid was just a bowery boy. Who made his living twirling his guns"". The night she's long, she's lanky. She speaks in her mother tongue. And lullabies the refugees. With an amplifier's hum. So break us now Big Mama. As Old Faithful breaks the day. Believe me, my sweet Linda,. Oh, help is sure on the way. The Confederacy, she's in my name now. And the hounds are held at bay. The axis needs a stronger arm. Do you feel your muscles play?. The Confederacy, she's in my name now. And the hounds are held at bay. The axis needs a stronger arm. Do you feel your muscles play?."
soul driver,"I rode through forty nights of the Gospels rain. 'neath black sky pouring snakes, frogs, and a love in vain. You were down where the river runs wide. Baby, let me be your soul driver. Well if something in the air feels a little unkind. Don't worry darling, oh it'll slip your mind. I'll be your gypsy joker your shotgun rider. Baby let me be your soul driver. Well now no one knows which way love's wheel turns. We may get rich or crash and burn. This fortune weight or just the black hand of fate. This love rushes over us and its ghostly voice. If the angels are unkind or if the seasons are dark. Or if in the air love just falls apart. Well then here's to our destruction. Baby let me be your soul driver. Yea here's to our destruction. Baby let me be your soul driver."
souls of the departed,"On the road to Basra stood young Lieutenant Jimmy Bly. Detailed to go through the clothes of the soldiers who died. At night in dreams he sees their souls rise. Like dark geese into the Oklahoma skies. Well this is a prayer for the souls of the departed. Those who've gone and left their babies brokenhearted. This is a prayer for the souls of the departed. Now Raphael Rodriguez was just seven years old. Shot down in a schoolyard by some East Compton Cholos. His mamma cried ""My beautiful boy is dead"". In the hills the self-made men just sighed and shook their heads. This is a prayer for the souls of the departed. Those who've gone and left their babies brokenhearted. Young lives over before they got started. This is a prayer for the souls of the departed. Tonight as I tuck my own son in bed. All I can think of is what if it would've been him instead. I want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down. Right here on my own piece of dirty ground. Now I ply my trade in the land of king dollar. Where you get paid and your silence passes as honor. And all the hatred and dirty little lies. Been written off the books and into decent men's eyes."
southern son,"Born on the Hudson, twenty-two years gone. Bred and raised in the City. From my daddy's knee I learned the Union songs. But Grandma sang lullabies of Dixie. And though the Northern winter fills my heart with joy. Oh it's a Southern sun that shines down. On this Yankee boy. Mama dreamed of Paris nights. And boatin' on the Seine. She said, we're gonna make it there too. Soon as Papa comes home again. And she'd speak to me in broken french. Dressed like a painting of Lautrec's. In the night she'd clutch me to her breast. And say, we'll make it outta here yet. And though Parisian women. Strut so fine down the Eiffel mall. It's a Southern one I sing my songs for. Well with the local bunch of do-good boys. And an old man from the West. We crossed the land in the caravan. Yes we traveled with the best. With circus acts and vaudeville hacks. And the Mississippi Delta Queen. She told me the news and sold me her blues. In an alley in New Orleans. And though the Western plains are still stained. With the blood of great cowboys. It's a Southern sun. That shine down on this Yankee boy."
spanish eyes,"Little Christine. We're takin' one more run. Secret heart, when the time has begun. Come to part. And hey, you're the one. And now we know. My heart is sold. And though we tried.

And all the bad that we've done. And all the times. we've rode on for glory. And .... And you took me with your spanish eyes. Stretch out baby. And call your daddy home. 'Cause I'm runnin' tonight. Couldn't be all alone. Yes I know how something died. But baby it was just for kicks. It was just for fun. Even with all the bad that we done. They can't say we didn't try. And I fell for your Spanish eyes. Saturday night special. Waitin' in the sheets. Oh come on. Talk to me, my sweet. And I'll try to make it complete this timeCome close and let me dry your eyes. Let me try to turn the lies. And let me kiss your spanish eyes. Let me kiss your spanish eyes. Let me kiss your spanish eyes. Let me kiss your spanish eyes. Come here, baby."
spanish harlem,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem. A rose that grows in Spanish Harlem. It's never seen the sun. It only comes up when the moon is on the run. And all the stars are leaving. Well, it grows right in the street. Up between the concrete. But soft and sweet, and (breathing??). There is a rose in Spanish Harlem. A rose that grows in Spanish Harlem. Oh, with eyes as black as coal. That reach down in my soul. And start a fire I can't control. I beg your pardon. Well, I want to pick that rose. And watch her as she grows. In my garden. There is a rose in Spanish Harlem. There is a rose in Spanish Harlem."

Spare parts and broken hearts. Keep the world turnin' around. Now Janey walked that baby across the floor night after night. But she was a young girl and she missed the party lights. Meanwhile in South Texas in a dirty oil patch. Bobby heard about his son bein' born and swore he wasn't ever goin' back. Spare parts and broken hearts. Keep the world turnin' around. Janey heard about a woman over in Calverton. Put her baby in the river let the river roll on. She looked at her boy in the crib where he lay. Got down on her knees cried till she prayed. Mist was on the water low run the tide. Janey held her son down at the riverside. Waist deep in water how bright the sun shone. She lifted him in her arms and carried him home. As he lay sleeping in her bed Janey took a look around at everything. Went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring. Took out her wedding dress tied that ring up in its sash. Went straight down to the pawn shop man and walked out with some good. cold cash. Spare parts and broken hearts. Keep the world turnin' around.

We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go. They're built like light. And they dance like spirits in the night (all night) in the night (all night). Oh you don't know what they can do to you. Spirits in the night, in the night. Stand up now and let it shoot through you. Well now Wild Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap. He said ""Trust some of this it'll show you where you're at or at least it'll help you really feel it"". By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers in the cake. I think I really dug her `cause I was too loose to fake. I said ""I'm hurt"" she said ""Honey let me heal it"". And we danced all night to a soul fairy band. And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can. She felt just right just like as sweet as a spirit in the night. In the night baby don't know what she do to you. Spirits in the night, in the night. Stand up now and let her shoot right through you. Now the night grew bright and the stars threw light in Billy and Davy. Dancin' in the moonlight. We were down near the water in a stone mud fight. Killer Joe'd passed out on the lawn. Well Hazy Davy got really hurt he crawled into the lake in just his socks and a shirt. Me and Crazy Janey were makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs. Janey said ""Hey little brother don't you think it's time now we go"". So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row felt just right. Together we moved like spirits in the night, all night. Baby don't know what it do to you. Spirits in the night, all night. Stand up now and let it shoot right through you."

Well, if you've lost control of the situation at hand,. Go grab a girl; go see a rock 'n roll band,. and stand on it.. Come on, man, stand on it!. Well now, Columbus, he discovered America. even though he hadn't planned on it.. He got lost and woke up one morning. when he's about to land on it..

stolen car,"I met a little girl and I settled down. In a little house out on the edge of town. We got married, and swore we'd never part. Then little by little we drifted from each other's heart. At first I thought it was just restlessness. That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep. In the end it was something more I guess. That tore us apart and made us weep. And I'm driving a stolen car. Down on Eldridge Avenue. Each night I wait to get caught. But I never do. She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote. When our love was young and bold. She said last night she read those letters. And they made her feel one hundred years old. And I'm driving a stolen car. On a pitch black night. And I'm telling myself I'm gonna be alright. But I ride by night and I travel in fear. That in this darkness I will disappear."

""Got a cold mind to go trippin' 'cross that thin line. I ain't makin' straight time. Eight years in it feels like you're gonna die. But you get used to anything. Sooner or later it just becomes your life. Kitchen floor in the evening tossin' my little babies high. Mary's smiling but she's watching me out of the corner of her eye. Seems you can't get any more than half free. I step out onto the front porch and suck the cold air deep inside of me. Got a cold mind to go trippin' 'cross that thin line. I'm sick of doin' straight time. In the basement huntin' gun and a hacksaw. Sip a beer and thirteen inches of barrel drop to the floor. Come home in the evening, can't get the smell from my hands.

stray bullet,In the tall grass we held hands. Down by the river we made plans. Of what would and would not be. It was impossible to see. Their black boots shone in the sun.

(to some far and distant shore). Down where this river meets the sea. (I'll make you mine forevermore). Over these dark hills I'd walk along. (just to hold you in my arms). To lie with you on a bed of stone. River blood red with the years. You can flood this valley with a thousand tears. Wash away all that's been found. But you'll never wash away the sound. Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down. (stray bullet shot my baby down). Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down. (stray bullet shot my baby down). Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down.

swallowed up (in the belly of the whale),I fell asleep on a dark and starlit sea. With nothing but the cloak of God's mercy over me. I come upon strange earth and a great black cave. I dreamt I awoke as if buried in my grave. We've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. Disappeared from this world. We've been swallowed up. The bones of sailors from the north and sailors from the east. Lay high in a pyre in the belly of a beast. A beast should you wander in its path upon your ship and your flesh he'll sup. You'll disappear from this world until you've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. Disappeared from this world. We've been swallowed up. We trusted our skills and our good sails. Our faith that with God the righteous in this world prevail. But we've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. Disappeared from this world. We've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. We've been swallowed up. Disappeared from this world. We've been swallowed up

take em as they come,"Last night I dreamed he was runnin' through the avalanche. Tears streamed your pretty face all burned red. Once your dead its done and not much remains. Down the highway another stranger comes. You gotta take em baby when they come. Little girl put on your red dress. Cause we're goin' out on the town tonight. And when I hold this switchblade. Lets be sure some fools gonna want to fight. You gotta take em baby as they come. You gotta take em. Take em as they come girl. Take em as they come girl. Take em as they come girl. Take em baby as they come. God save the rider in the black night. Save the man who taught that it was right. To do what they have dreamt of. So we come what we have become. You gotta take em baby when they come. Little girl gone are birthdays. Faded away into the clear blue night. And all the promises we made. Lie shattered and broken in the morning light. You gotta take em baby when they come. You gotta take em. Take em as they come girl. Take em as they come girl. Take em as they come girl. Take em baby as they come. I know your heart is breakin'. I can feel it too girl. Though my finger on the trigger is shakin'. There's just one thing you could do girl. There's winners and losers. All the same from the other side. But we could choose here girl. We could try, couldn't we hon. To take em baby when they come. Take em as they come girl. Take em as they come girl. Take em as they come girl.

taxi cab,"Taxicab, taxicab at the light. Won't you take me on a ride. Through this city at night. I got some money and I'm feelin' fine. I ain't no hurry so just take your time. Some people wanna die young and gloriously. Well taxicab driver, hey that ain't me. I got a cute little baby. down at 12th and Vine. And she opens for business just about closin' time.

tenth avenue freeze-out,"Tear drops on the city. Bad Scooter searching for his groove. Seem like the whole world walking pretty. And you can't find the room to move. Well everybody better move over, that's all. Cause I'm running on the bad side. And I got my back to the wall. Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out. I'm stranded in the jungle. Tryn to take all the heat they was giving. The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright. And lined with the light of the living. From a tenement window a transistor blasts. Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast. I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out. Tenth Avenue freeze-out. And I'm all alone, I'm all alone. And kid you better get the picture. And I'm on my own, I'm on my own. And I can't go home. When the change was made uptown. And the Big Man joined the band. From the coastline to the city. All the little pretties raise their hands. I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh. When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half. With a Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out. Tenth Avenue freeze-out...."
terry's song,"Well they built the Titanic to be one of a kind, but many ships have ruled the seas. They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone, but they could build another if they please. Taj Mahal, the pyramids of Egypt, are unique I suppose. But when they built you, brother, they broke the mold. Now the world is filled with many wonders under the passing sun. And sometimes something comes along and you know it's for sure the only one. The Mona Lisa, the David, the Sistine Chapel, Jesus, Mary, and Joe. And when they built you, brother, they broke the mold. When they built you, brother, they turned dust into gold. When they built you, brother, they broke the mold. They say you can't take it with you, but I think that they're wrong. 'Cause all I know is I woke up this morning, and something big was gone. Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold. Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold. Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth. And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and cursed. But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told. And when she built you, brother, she broke the mold. That attitude's a power stronger than death, alive and burning her stone cold. When they built you, brother"
that's what you get,"The moonlight dances on her face. I got my lips ????. I'm living the life of a lie. It was for me, for me that she died. That's What you get for loving me (repeated 4 times). ???? [whole line unintelligible]. True Love, unhappiness. I fall down on my knees and I cry. It's my way of saying goodbye. That's what you get for loving me (repeated 5 times). The moonlight is ?? on the ???. As I ??? (into my?) head. And I, I'm gonna cry. It's my way of saying goodbye. That's what you get for loving me (repeat to fade)."
the angel,"The angel rides with hunch-backed children, poison oozing from his engine. Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven. Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked. The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires strokes his precious pavement. The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes in Volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors. Followin' dead-end signs into the sores. The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore. Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain. She rubs against the weather-beaten frame and asks the angel for his name. Off in the distance the marble dome reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown. The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones."
the ballad of the architect angel,"The architect angel held <?> Juda ranch.. Just a dirty mile down on the borderline.. Where he mastered blastin' and hustled young cattle for slaughter. And dated Juda's daughter.. From the cellar aways to the attics and all across the plains. Broke electric static of religious strain,. And though he was never an addict, he wore scars on his veins.. Like a young girl holds her first pimp, he held his Bible in.. From desert bars and church bazaars, the hunger slowly came. With vulgar faces from vulgar places lookin' for a game.. Well, ivory gun handles and chamber grease. And souped-up hydroplanes.. The bullets burn from TV silver, bearin' great cowboys' names.. Now with 14 inches of gun barrel, smokin' from the lid,. Spurs on straight black bootheels, he said ""They call me the Brooklyn Kid."". And in his lonely Zenith nightmares, well that's just what they did.. Oh, how he played out his scenes, loaded on <?> dreams.. Well, his holster slung low like a hot kid-sister. Tied back to his leg like he gonna do.. He was stompin' the step he called the Quickman Twister.. His six-guns were pumpin' through.. His tongue hung low like sawdust scrapin' across the plains.. He crawled up outside the Juda Ranch.. And started callin' the angel names.. And now the architect angel stood, in one hand a staff, the other a gun.. He held the staff high in the wind. The gun was like a piece in the sun.. He started howlin' like a monsoon wind. Drew fast. The job was done.. At night the moon stretched tight light 'cross the plains,. As real cowboys sat around real campfire flames,. And the county wolf called as if to explain to his son. The way the West was won.. The West was finally won.. The way the West was won.."
the big muddy,"Billy had a mistress down on 'A' and 12th. She was that little somethin' that he did for himself. His own little secret didn't hurt nobody. Come the afternoon he'd take her wadin'. Waist deep in the big muddy. Waist deep in the big muddy. You start out standing but end up crawlin'. Got in some trouble and needed a hand from a friend of mine. This old friend he had a figure in mind. It was nothing illegal just a little bit funny. He said ""C'mon don't tell me that the rich don't know. Sooner or later it all comes down to money"". And you're waist deep in the big muddy. Waist deep in the big muddy. You start on higher ground but end up crawlin'. Well I had a friend said ""You watch what you do. Poison snake bites you and you're poison too""*. How beautiful the river flows and the birds they sing. But you and I we're messier things. There ain't no one leavin' this world buddy. Without their shirttail dirty. Or their hands bloody. Waist deep in the big muddy. Waist deep in the big muddy. You start on higher ground but end up somehow crawlin'. Waist deep in the big muddy."

the brokenhearted,"Well darling, oh won't you come a little closer. I promise pretty darling, I didn't know what I was saying. And now I'm praying that you won't say it's over. Come here pretty baby and rest your head upon my shoulder. Just one kiss and we started. Now don't leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted. And tell me that you need me. Well now baby, the lonely nights keep growing longer. And my love for you just keeps growing stronger. Like a wheel of chance so endlessly turning. My fate lay in your hands, my heart forever burning. In a sweet fire your kiss started. Now don't leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted. And tell me that you love me. Tell me that you want me, girl. The cruel mistakes I've made, the hard price that I've paid. For the good times and for laughter. Girl, I should've known for the indifference that I've shown. I'd pay forever after. And darling, now all I'm trying to say is passion. And love, they have a way of slipping into blackness. Uncared for of slipping away. The deck is cut, the cards turned, the hand is played. And all we ever hope for burns to ashes and drifts away. Now don't let our love slip into this darkness. Don't leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted. And tell me that you love me. Tell me that you need me. Tell me that you love me. Tell me that you want me. Tell me that you need me. Tell me that you want me. Tell me that you love me. Yeah tell me that you love me. Tell me that you love me. Tell me that you want me. And come on now daring.

the fuse,"Down at the court house they're ringing the flag down. Long black line of cars snaking slow through town. Red sheets snapping on the line. With this ring will you be mine. The fuse is burning, shut out the lights. The fuse is burning, come on let me do you right. Trees on fire with the first fall's frost. Long black line in front of Holy Cross. Blood moon rising in a sky of black dust. Tell me baby who do you trust?. The fuse is burning, shut out the lights. The fuse is burning, come on let me do you right. Tyres on the highway hissing something's coming. You can feel the wires in the tree tops humming. Devil's on the horizon line. Your kiss and I'm alive. Quiet afternoon, an empty house. On the edge of bed you slip off your blouse. The room is burning with the noon sun. Your bittersweet taste on my tongue. The fuse is burning, shut out the lights. The fuse is burning, come on let me do you right. The fuse is burning, shut out the lights. The fuse is burning, come on let me do you right. The fuse is burning, the fuse is burning. The fuse is burning, the fuse is burning."
the ghost of tom joad,"Men walkin' 'long the railroad tracks. Goin' someplace there's no goin' back. Highway patrol choppers comin' up over the bridge. Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge. Shelter line stretchin' 'round the corner. Welcome to the new world order. Families sleepin' in their cars in the Southwest. No home no job no peace no rest. The highway is alive tonight. But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes. I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light. Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad. He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag. Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag. Waitin' for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last. In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass. Got a one-way ticket to the promised land. You got a hole in your belly and gun in your hand. Sleepin' on a pillow of solid rock. Bathin' in the city aqueduct. The highway is alive tonight. Where it's headed everybody knows. I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light. Waitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad. Now Tom said ""Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy. Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries. Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air. Look for me mom I'll be there. Wherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand. Or a decent job or a helpin' hand. Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free. Look in their eyes Mom you'll see me."". Well the highway is alive tonight. But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes.

the hitter,"Come to the door ma and unlock the chain. Well I was just passin' through and got caught in the rain. There's nothing that I want, nothin' that you need say. Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way. I was no more than a kid when you put me on the Southern Queen. With the police on my back I fled to New Orleans. Well I fought in the dockyards for the the money that I made. I knew the fight was my home and the blood was my trade. Baton Rouge, Ponchatoula, and Lafayette town. They payed me their money, ma, I knocked the man down. Well I did what I did, yeah it come easily. Restraint and mercy were always strangers to me. I fought champion Jack Thompson in a field full of mud. Rain poured through the tent to the canvas and mixed with our blood. In the twelfth, I slipped my tounge over my broken jaw. I stood over him and I pounded his bloody body into the floor. Well the bell rang and rang and still I kept on. 'Til I felt my glove leather slip 'tween his skin and bone. Then the women and the money came fast and the days I lost track. The women red, the money green, but the numbers were black. I fought for the men in their silk suits to lay down their bets. Well I took my good share, ma, I have no regrets. I took the fix at the state armory with Big John McDowell. From high in the rafters I watched myself fall. As they raised his arm my stomach twisted and the sky it went black. I stuffed my bag with their good money and I never looked back. Understand, in the end, Ma, every man plays the game. If you know me one different then speak out his name. Ma, if my voice now you don't recognize. Then just open the door and look into your dark eyes. I ask of you nothin', not a kiss not a smile,. Just open the door and let me lie down for a while. Now the gray rain's fallin' and my ring fightin's done. So in the work fields and alleys I take all who'll come. If you're a better man than me then just step to the line. Show me your money and speak out your crime. Now there's nothin' I want, Ma, nothin' that you need say. Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way. Tonight in the shipyard a man draws a circle in the dirt. I move to the center and I take off my shirt. I study him for the cuts, the scars, the pain,. Man, nor time can erase. I move hard to the left and I strike to the face"
the honeymooners,"Two kids get married, same old thing. Folks congratulate you, church bells ring. Who's got the ring, who's gonna pay the priest. Get your name in the paper, picture or two at least. And at the reception all the old records play. ""Where you gonna live, are you gonna take her away?"". In a corner my new nephew's showin' me his knife. You swore that you'd love her for the rest of your life. Went to kiss you at the altar we bumped heads. Honeymoon night we figured we best shake on it instead. Dressed kinda funny, laughin' we hop in bed. You can wear it on your feet, you can wear it on your head. Come mornin' my new family's sitting on the front porch swing. Smilin' kinda funny, nobody says a thing. My new brother-in-law's throwin' a football, he tosses me a pass. We all sit down on the front stoop, everybody happy at last."
the iceman,"Sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge. Baby this emptiness has already been judged. I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got. You're a strange part of me you're a preacher's girl. And I don't want no piece of this mechanical world. Got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot. We'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door. And even the white angels of Eden with their flaming swords. Won't be able to stop us from hitting town in this dirty old Ford. Well it don't take no nerve when you got nothing to guard. I got tombstone in my eyes and I'm running real hard. My baby was a lover and the world just blew her away. Once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right out of my head. Well baby they didn't know that I was born dead. I am the iceman, fighting for the right to live. I say better than the glory roads of heaven. Better off riding hell-bound in the dirt. Better than bright line of the freeway. Better than the shadows of your daddy's church. Better than the hands of waiting (?). Baby better off is the search."
the last carnival,"Sundown, sundown. They're taking all the tents down. Where have you gone my handsome Billy?. Sundown, sundown. The carnival train's leaving town. Where are you now darling Billy?. We won't be dancing together on the high wire. Facing the lions with you at my side anymore. We won't be breathin' the smoke and the fire. On a midway. Hanging from the trapeze. My wrists waiting for your wrists. Two daredevils high up on the wall of death. You throwin' the knife that lands inches from my heart. Sundown. Moonrise, moonrise. The light that was in your eyes has gone away. Daybreak, daybreak. The thing in you that made me ache has gone to stay. We'll be riding the train without you tonight. The train that keeps on movin'. Its black smoke scorching the evening sky. A millions stars shining above us like every soul livin' and dead. Has been gathered together by a God to sing a hymn over your bones. Sun down, sun down. Empty are the fairgrounds. Where are you now handsome Billy?"
the line,"I got my discharge from Fort Irwin. Took a place on the San Diego county line. Felt funny bein' a civilian again. It'd be some time. My wife had died a year ago. I was still tryin' to find my way back whole. Went to work for the INS on the line. With the California border patrol. Bobby Ramirez was a ten year veteran. We became friends. His family was from. Guanajuato. So the job it was different for him. He said ""They risk death in the deserts and mountains. Pay all they got to the smugglers rings. We send 'em home and they come right back again. Carl hunger is a powerful thing."". Well I was good at doin' what I was to. l'd Kept my uniform pressed and clean. At night I chased their shadows. Thru the arroyos and ravines. Drug runners farmers with their families. Young women with little children by their sides. Come night we'd wait out in the canyons. And try to keep 'em from crossin' the line. Well the first time that I saw her. She was in the holdin' pen. Our eyes met and she looked away. Then she looked back again. Her hair was black as coal. Her eyes reminded me of what I'd lost. She had a young child cryin' in her arms. I asked ""Senora is there anything I can do?"". There's a bar in Tijuana. Where me and Bobby drink alongside. The same people we'd sent back the day before. She said her name was Louisa. She was from Sonora and had just come north. We danced and I held her in my arms. And I knew what I would do. She said she had some family in Madera county. If she her child and younger brother could just get thru. At night they come across the levee. In the searchlight's dusty glow. We'd rush 'em in our Broncos. Force 'em back down into the river below. She climbed into my truck. She leaned toward me and we kissed. As we drove her brother's shirt slipped open. And I saw the tape across his chest. We were just about on the highway. When Bobby's jeep come up in the dust on my right. I pulled over and let my engine run. And stepped out into his lights. I felt myself movin'. My gun restin' 'neath my hand. We stood there starin' at each other. As off thru the arroyo she ran. Bobby Ramirez he never said nothin'. 6 months later I left the line. I drifted to the central valley. And took what work I could find. At night I searched the local bars. And the migrant towns. Lookin' for my Louisa. With the black hair fallin' down."
the little things (my baby does),The way she kisses so tenderly. The way she gives her love to me. I been felt by the graces and angels up above. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. That make me love her. The way she sighs when I hold her tight. Good times and bad will be alright. Faces on the street they push hard and they shove. Disappear with the little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. I know I love her. The soft summer breeze fills her every sigh. Her eyes are bluer than the summer sky. I been felt by the graces and angels up above. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. That make me love her. And when the night closes in. I'm drifting and I can't find a friend. On the wings of the angels I'm saved by her love. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. That make me love her. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does. The little things my baby does
the long goodbye,My soul went walkin' but I stayed here. Feel like I been workin' for a thousand years. Chippin' away at this chain of my own lies. Climbin' a wall a hundred thousand miles high. Well I woke up this morning on the other side. Yeah yeah this is the long goodbye. Hey yeah this is the long goodbye. Same old faces it's the same old town. What once was laughs is draggin' me now. Wailin' on rain hangin' on for love. Words of forgiveness from some God above. Ain't no words of mercy comin' from on high. Oh no just a long goodbye. Yeah yeah just one long goodbye. Well I went to leave twenty years ago. Since then I guess I been packin' kinda slow. Sure did like that admirin' touch. Guess I like'd it a little too much. The moon is high and here I am. Sittin' here with this hammer in hand. One more drink oughta ease the pain. Starin' at that last link in the chain. Well let's raise our glass and let this hammer fly. Hey yeah this is the long goodbye. Hey yeah this is the long goodbye.
the man who got away,"Last night I went to the Coronado. I bought my ticket and I found my seat. It was a new adventure straight from Hollywood. Lights went down as I felt the heat. They went tearing from the final scene. Burning rubber, spilling gasoline. As the credits rolled away. They were still chasing the man who got away. Well, every night for weeks and weeks now. I beat the traffic, I beat the heat now. For two hours I can believe now. The man who got away was me. I went tearing from the final scene. Burning rubber, spilling gasoline. As the credits rolled away. They were still chasing the man who got away. Drove into Stockton, my radio went dead. That's when I heard what the newsman said. Said, ""armed robbery on the ten-hundred block. Was two men involved and one man shot. Well, while his accomplice made the payday. With a 45 he blew the cashier away way. Last seen headed on the State Highway. Driving a late model Chevrolet. I went screaming from the final scene. In a hail of bullets and flaming gasoline. As the credits rolled away. They were still chasing the man who got away. Man that got away. Man that got away. Man that got away. Whoa!"
the new timer,He rode the rails since the Great Depression. Fifty years out on the skids. He said 'You don't cross nobody. You'll be all right out here kid.'. Left my family in Pennsylvania. Searchin' for work I hit the road. I met Frank in East Texas. In a freight yard blown thru with snow. From New Mexico to Colorado California to the sea. Frank he showed me the ropes sir=20. Just till I could get back on my feet. I hoed sugar beets outside of Firebaugh I picked the peaches from the. Marysville trees. They bunked us in a barn just like animals. Me and a hundred others just like me. We split up come the springtime. I never seen Frank again. 'Cept one rainy night he blew by me on a grainer. Shouted my name and disappeared in the rain and wind. They found him shot dead outside of Stockton. His body lyin' on a muddy hill. Nothin' taken nothin' stolen. Somebody killin' just to kill. Late that summer was rollin' thru the plains of Texas. A vision passed before my eyes. A small house sittin' trackside. With the glow of the savior's beautiful light. A woman stood cookin' in the kitchen. Kid sat at a table with his old man. Now I wonder does my son miss me. Does he wonder where I am. Tonight I pick my campsite carefully. Outside the Sacramento yard. Gather some wood and light a fire. In the early winter dark. Wind whistling cold I pull my coat around me. Heat some coffee and stare out into the black night. I lie awake I lie awake sir. With my machete by my side. My Jesus your gracious love and mercy. Tonight I'm sorry could not fill my heart. Like one good rifle. And the name of who I ought to kill.
the price you pay,"You make up your mind, you choose the chance you take. You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks. Out on to an open road you ride until the day. You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay. Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies. And in one last breath they built the roads they'd ride to their death. Driving on through the night, unable to break away. From the restless pull of the price you pay. (Chorus). Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay. Now you can't walk away from the price you pay. Now they'd come so far and they'd waited so long. Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong. Where the dark of night holds back the light of day. And you've gotta stand and fight for the price you pay. (Chorus). Little girl down on the strand. With that pretty little baby in your hands. Do you remember the story of the promised land. How he crossed the desert sands. And could not enter the chosen land. On the banks of the river he stayed. To face the price you pay. So let the games start, you better run you little wild heart. You can run through all the nights and all the days. But just across the county line, a stranger passing through put up a sign. That counts the men fallen away to the price you pay,. and girl before the end of the day,. I'm gonna tear it down and throw it away."
the promise,"Johnny works in a factory and Billy works downtown. Terry works in a rock'n'roll band. Looking for that million-dollar sound. Me I don't do nothing much,. I spend a lot of time alone. Some nights I go to the drive-in,. And some night I stay home. I followed that dream. Just like those guys do way up on the screen. Drove a chopped up Challenger. down Route 9. Through the dead ends and all the bad scenes. And when the promise was broken. I cashed in a few of my dream. Well, I built that Challenger by myself. But I needed money and so I sold it. I lived a secret I should've kept to myself. But I got drunk one night and I told it. All my life I fought that fight. The one that no man can never win. And every day it just gets harder. To live the dream I'm believing in. Thunder Road .... I stay up every morning until it turns light. Thunder Road .... There's something dying out on the highway tonight. Well now I won big once and I hit the coast,. Oh but somehow I paid the big cost. Inside I felt like I was carrying. The broken spirits of all the other ones who lost. When the promise is broken you go on living. But man it takes something from down in your soul. Like when the truth is spoken, it don't make no. difference. Finally something in your heart turns cold. Yeah I followed that dream, me and some guysIn the dead ends and all the. two-bit bars. The night the promise was broken. I was drunk and far away from home,. Sleeping with a stranger. In the back seat of a borrowed car. Thunder Road .... Here's one for the lost lovers and all the fixed games. Thunder Road .... Here's one for the tires rushing by in the rain. Thunder Road .... I remember when me and Billy, we'd always say. Thunder Road .... We were gonna take it all, and throw it all away."
the promise ii,"Johnny works in a factory and Billy works downtown. Terry works in a rock 'n' roll band looking for that million-dollar sound. Me I got a little job down in Darlington but some nights I don't go. Some nights I go to the drive-in and some night I stay home. You see I followed that dream just like those guys do way up on the screen. With a built-up Challenger down route 9. Through the dead ends and all the bad scenes. And when the promise was broken I cashed in a few of my old dreams. You see I built that Challenger by myself. But I needed money and so I sold it. And I lived a secret I should have kept to myself. But I got drunk one night and I told it. All my life I fought that fight. The one that I can't ever win. And everyday it just gets harder to live. The dreams I'm believing in. Thunder Road. Oh baby you were so right. Thunder Road. There's something dying on the Highway tonight. Well now my Daddy taught me how to walk quiet. And how to make my peace with the past. And I learned real good to tighten up inside. And I don't say nothin' unless I'm asked. When the promise is broken you go on livin'. But it takes something from down in your soul. Like when the truth is spoken. And it don't make no difference. Something in your heart turns cold. You see I followed that dream, me and some guys. Through the dead ends and all the two-bit bars. When the promise was broken. I was drunk and far away from home. Sleeping with a stranger in the back seat of a borrowed car. Thunder Road. And when it washes away with the rain. Thunder Road. You learn to walk among the remains. Thunder Road. I remember when me and Terry we'd always say. Thunder Road. We were gonna take it all. And throw it all. Away."
the promised land,On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert. I pick up my money and head back into town. Driving cross the Waynesboro county line. I got the radio on and I'm just killing time. Working all day in my daddy's garage. Driving all night chasing some mirage. Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands. Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man. And I believe in a promised land. I've done my best to live the right way. I get up every morning and go to work each day. But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold. Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode. Explode and tear this town apart. Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart. Find somebody itching for something to start. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands. Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man. And I believe in a promised land. There's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor. I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm. Gonna be a twister to blow everything down. That ain't got the faith to stand its ground. Blow away the dreams that tear you apart. Blow away the dreams that break your heart. Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands. Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man. And I believe in a promised land.
the rising,"Can't see nothin' in front of me. Can't see nothin' coming up behind. I make my way through this darkness. I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me. Lost track of how far I've gone. How far I've gone, how high I've climbed. On my back's a sixty pound stone. On my shoulder a half mile line. Come on up for the rising. Com on up, lay your hands in mine. Come on up for the rising. Come on up for the rising tonight. Left the house this morning. Bells ringing filled the air. Wearin' the cross of my calling. On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here. Come on up for the rising. Come on up, lay your hands in mine. Come on up for the rising. Come on up for the rising tonight. Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li. Spirits above and behind me. Faces gone, black eyes burnin' bright. May their precious blood forever bind me. Lord as I stand before your fiery light. Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li. I see you Mary in the garden. In the garden of a thousand sighs. There's holy pictures of our children. Dancin' in a sky filled with light. May I feel your arms around me. May I feel your blood mix with mine. A dream of life comes to me. Like a catfish dancin' on the end of the line. Sky of blackness and sorrow ( a dream of life). Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life). Sky of glory and sadness ( a dream of life). Sky of mercy, sky of fear ( a dream of life). Sky of memory and shadow ( a dream of life). Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight. Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life). Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life ( a dream of life). Come on up for the rising. Come on up, lay your hands in mine. Come on up for the rising. Come on up for the rising tonight. Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li."
the river,"I come from down in the valley. Where mister, when you're young. They bring you up to do like your daddy done. Me and Mary we met in high school. When she was just seventeen. We'd drive out of this valley. down to where the fields were green. We'd go down to the river. And into the river we'd dive. Oh down to the river we'd ride. Then I got Mary pregnant. And, man, that was all she wrote. And for my 19th birthday. I got a union card and a wedding coat. We went down to the courthouse. And the judge put it all to rest. No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle. No flowers, no wedding dress. That night we went down to the river. And into the river we'd dive. Oh down to the river we did ride. I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company. But lately there ain't been much work. on account of the economy. Now all them things that seemed so important. Well mister they vanished right into the air. Now I just act like I don't remember. Mary acts like she don't care. But I remember us riding in my brother's car. Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir. At night on them banks I'd lie awake. And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take. Now those memories come back to haunt me. They haunt me like a curse. Is a dream a lie if it don't come true. Or is it something worse. that sends me down to the river. though I know the river is dry. That sends me down to the river tonight. Down to the river. My baby and I. Oh down to the river we ride"
the ties that bind,"You been hurt and you're all cried out you say. You walk down the street pushin' people outta your way. You packed your bags and all alone you wanna ride,. You don't want nothin', don't need no one by your side. You're walkin' tough baby, but you're walkin' blind. (Chorus). The ties that bind. Now you can't break the ties that bind. Cheap romance, it's all just a crutch. You don't want nothin' that anybody can touch. You're so afraid of being somebody's fool. Not walkin' tough baby, not walkin' cool. You walk cool, but darlin', can you walk the line. And face the ties that bind. The ties that bind. Now you can't break the ties that bind. I would rather feel the hurt inside, yes I would darlin',. Than know the emptiness your heart must hide,. Yes I would darlin', yes I would darlin',. Yes I would baby. You sit and wonder just who's gonna stop the rain. Who'll ease the sadness, who's gonna quiet the pain. It's a long dark highway and a thin white line. Connecting baby, your heart to mine. We're runnin' now but darlin' we will stand in time. To face the ties that bind. The ties that bind. Now you can't break the ties that bind. You can't forsake the ties that bind."
the time that never was,"Oh whoa whoa. Oh whoa. Oh whoa. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and it cuts me like a knife. I come face-to-face with my longing for another world, another life. And a time that never was. Oh a time that never was. We drove on, fueled not by the future but by a past we could never touch. Forced to run head-on collisions till we vanished in the dust. Of a time that never was. Whoa whoa whoa, the time that never was. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. So kiss me once more baby, one more kiss baby you must. Don't ever let me forget, girl, a time that never was. A time that never was. Oh whoa whoa, the time that never was. Oh whoa whoa, the time that never was. Oh whoa whoa, that never was. Oh whoa whoa whoa. Oh whoa whoa. Oh whoa whoa whoa"
the wall,"Cigarettes and a bottle of beer. This poem that I wrote for you. This black stone and these hard tears. Are all I've got left now of you. I remember you in your Marine uniform laughing. Laughing that you're shipping out probably. I read Robert McNamara says he's sorry. You and your boots and black t-shirt. Ah Billy you looked so bad. Ya, you and your rock and roll band. Was the best thing this shit town ever had. Now the man who put you here. He feeds his family in rich dining halls. And apology and forgiveness have no place here at all. At the wall. I'm sorry I missed you last year. I couldn't find no one to drive me. If your eyes could cut through that black stone. Tell me would they recognize me?. For the living, time must be served. Life goes on. Cigarettes and a bottle of beer. Skin on black stone. High School pictures, paper flowers. Ribbon, red as the blood. Ya, as the blood you spilled. In the Central Highlands mud. Now the limousines rush down Pennsylvania Boulevard. As the rain falls. And apology and forgiveness have no place here at all"
the way,"The way your heart beats when I hold you tight. The way you sigh when we kiss goodnight. The way the wind blows through the trees. Well hey, that's the way you belong to me. The way you warm me baby when I'm cold. The way you make me want you body and soul. The way the rivers run to the sea. Well hey, that's the way you belong to me. The way you soothe me when I'm in pain. The way you make the blood rush in my veins. The way the winds rush through the trees. Well hey, that's the way you belong to me. When I lose faith you take my hand. The way you make me feel like I'm a man. The way the sun belongs to the sea. Well hey, that's the way you belong to me. The way you make me feel like I belong. And if I could girl though I know it'd be wrong. I'd lock you deep inside. 'till the last rains fall. And hide you from the emptiness of it all. Sometimes at night I lie awake. I pull you close and feel each breath you take. The way the rivers belong to the seas. Well hey, that's the way you belong to me. Well hey, that's the way you belong to me."
the wish,"Dirty old street, all slushed up in the rain and snow.. Little boy and his ma,. standin' outside a run-down music store window.. On top of the Christmas tree shines one beautiful star,. and lyin' underneath, a brand new Japanese guitar.. I remember in the mornin' Ma, hearin' your alarm clock ring.. I'd lie awake and listen to you gettin' ready for work,. the sound of your makeup case on the sink.. And the ladies at the office, all silk stockin's and rustlin' skirts.. And how proud and happy you always looked, walkin' home from work.. Well if Pa's eyes were windows, into a world so deadly and true,. you couldn't stop me from lookin', but you kept me from crawlin' through.. Well it's a funny old world Ma,. where a little boy's wishes come true.. Well I got a few in my pocket, and a special one just for you.. It ain't no phone call on Sunday, flowers, or a Mother's day card.. It ain't no house on the hill, with a garden and a nice little yard.. I got my hot rod down on Bond Street,. I'm older but you'll know me at a glance.. We'll find us a rock 'n roll bar, baby we'll go out and dance.. Well it was me in my Beatle boots, you in pink curlers and matador pants,. gettin' up in the livin' room, to do the twist for my uncles and aunts.. Well I got a girl of my own now Ma,. yeah, we're doin' OK.. And I've been workin' up the nerve, to say what it is I got to say.. Last night we sat around laughin', at all those things that guitar brought. us,. and I laid awake thinkin' about the other things it's brought.. Well tonight I'm takin's requests here in the kitchen,. this one's for you, let me come right out and say,. that if you're lookin' for a sad song, well, I'm not gonna play."
the word,"Well you flash your tongue like diamonds. You tied me to your wildcat schemes. And you forced me into a power dive. And left your mark on my jeans. And I hear the word on your soldiers. And I hear the word on Jesus too. I heard the word on the country. But I never heard the word on you. Your love was like a machine gun. I wore your bugle in my belt. And I was your kid glove lover. All the cards were yours. You always dealt. And I stood before your soapbox. Noiseless and shoeless. Playing my pantry boy's games. You had your hands raised up to the sky. Shouting Oh Sunday deity. Oh Big Daddy Longlegs. Come down and bless your sister please. You were shoutin' orders about the construction. Going on down the highway. You were namin' names, blamin' blames. And you blamed me. You wore your heart like a challenge. Far and apart for anyone who came. Open and wide like the river. With rocks on both sides to keep the water tame. But I heard the word on your high tides. And I felt the pain when I tried. To rip your flood gates wide. And pull your body on over to my side. Where we both could hide. But you heard about the freedom ride. And you heard about the Highway Crew. Who could cut the light a little bit faster than you. So you left me just your shoes. And I hear the word on Jesus. And I hear the word on his marching troop. And I hear the word on the country. But I never heard the word on you."

Have you ever seen a one-legged man. trying to dance his way free?. If you've ever seen a one-legged man. then you've seen me"
then she kissed me,"She walked up to me and asked me if I wanted to dance. She looked kind of fine, so I thought that I might just take that chance. and when we danced she held me tight. when I walked her home that night. we stood beneath the moon so bright. and she kissed me. The first time I saw her I knew I had to see her again. I knew we was gonna be so much more than just friends. I didn't know just what to do so I whispered I love you. She said that she loved me too. and she kissed me. She kissed me in a way I've never been kissed before. She kissed me in a way I wanna be kissed forevermore. I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had. but I ain't the kinda guy she could take home to meet her dad. Run with me and I'll make you my bride.

this hard land,"Hey there mister can you tell me what happened to the seeds I've sown. Can you give me a reason sir as to why they've never grown. They've just blown around from town to town. Till they're back out on these fields. Where they fall from my hand. Back into the dirt of this hard land. Now me and my sister from Germantown. We did ride. We made our bed sir from the rock on the mountainside. We been blowin' around from town to town. Lookin for a place to stand. Where the sun burst through the cloud. To fall like a circle. Like a circle of fire down on this hard land. Now even the rain it don't come 'round. It don't come 'round here no more. And the only sound at night's the wind. Slammin' the back porch door. It just stirs you up like it wants to blow you down. Twistin' and churnin' up the sand. Leavin' all them scarecrows lyin' face down. Face down in the dirt of this hard land. From a building up on the hill. I can hear a tape deck blastin' ""Home on the Range"". I can see them Bar-M choppers. Sweepin' low across the plains. It's me and you Frank we're lookin' for lost cattle. Our hooves twistin' and churnin' up the sand. We're ridin' in the whirlwind searchin' for lost treasure. Way down south of the Rio Grande. We're ridin' cross that river. In the moonlight. Up onto the banks of this hard land. Hey Frank won't ya pack your bags. And meet me tonight down at Liberty Hall. Just one kiss from you my brother. And we'll ride until we fall. Well sleep in the fields. We'll sleep by the rivers and in the morning. We'll make a plan. We'll if you can't make it. Stay hard, stay hungry, stay alive. If you can. And meet me in a dream of this hard land."

As you slip into my car the evening sky strikes sparks. This life, this life and then the next. With you I have been blessed, what more can you expect. At night at my telescope alone. This emptiness I've roamed. Searching for a home. The stars a brief string of shining charms. Rushing in red out of our arms into the drifting dark. This life, this life and then the next. With you I have been blessed, what more can you expect. This life, this life and then the next. I finger the hem of your dress, my universe at rest. We reach for starlight all night long but gravity's too strong. Chained to this earth we go on and on and on. Then a million suns cresting where you stood. A beauty in the neighborhood. This lonely planet never looked so good. This life, this life and then the next. With you I have been blessed, what more can you expect. This life, this life and then the next. I finger the hem of your dress, my universe at rest"

thunder road,"The screendoor slams, Mary's dress waves. Like a vision she dances across the porch. As the radio plays. Roy Orbison singin' for the lonely. Hey that's me and I want you only. Don't turn me home again I just can't face myself alone again. Don't run back inside, darlin' you know just what I'm here for. So you're scared and you're thinkin' that maybe we ain't that young anymore. Show a little faith, there's magic in the night. You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're all right. Oh, and that's all right with me. You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain. Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain. Waste your summer prayin' in vain for a savior to ride from these streets. Well now I'm no hero, that's understood. All the redemption I can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood. With a chance to make it good somehow. Hey what else could we do now. Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair. Well the night's bustin' open, these two lanes will take us anywhere. We got one last chance to make it real. To trade in these wings on some wheels. Climb in back heaven's waitin' down on the tracks. Oh, oh come take my hand. We're ridin' out tonight to case the promised land. Oh, oh thunder road. Oh, thunder road. Oh, thunder road. Lyin' out there like a killer in the sun. Hey I know it's late, we can make it if we run. Oh, oh thunder road. Sit tight, take hold. Thunder road. Well I got this guitar and I've learned how to make it talk. And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk. From the front porch to my front seat. The door's open but the ride ain't free. And I know you're hungry for words that I ain't spoke. But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken. There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away. They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets. They scream your name at night in the streets. Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet. And in the lonely cool before dawn. You hear their engines roarin' on. But when you get to the front porch, they're gone. On the wind. So Mary climb in. It's a town full of losers. And I'm pullin' outta here to win."

tokyo,"The moon hung like a shadow on a rung over Shanghai. And the soldier boys were returning home screaming ""Bonzai!"". And the kids are still playing their games,. Getting hustled and rustled out in the rain. As I sat inside listening to the broadcast.. Oh save my soul sweet rock and roll 'cuz I'm sinking fast.. And then the band played.. (Out of nowhere). (Everybody). (Everybody). Well now the legendary chaplain of the fighting 51st. Was getting ready to go.. I said ""Padre do you know a cheap virgin who likes to tango?"". He said ""You can try Linda Lee;. Around the corner and across the sea.. Oh word is out, word is out she's fast."". Oh blow me down now Linda, 'cuz I'm sinking fast.. Yes and them cats are sure getting fat down in the trainyard.. And the sandman brings them dreams they ship out in boxcars.. The union says hold; break out the dice, break out the gold.. It's lunchtime at last.. And old big mama said George Raff's tonight on the late show.. She sits straddling the kitchen chair really gung-ho. She shivers with chills, wet with slotcar thrills. Hypnotically lost in the glass. And we all sighed.... With the sunrise. As we watched the credits pass.. And the little blue dot went away.. And then the morning cloak fell down like a hoax over sleepytown. And garbage truck Big Lenny's out drinking the last round. He hurriedly sipped his beer, and poking fun of the queer. And threatened to kick his ass.. And the bell rang. And the horn blows. And he's outside pumping gas. But things were moving so slow tonight. So the kid goes back inside the station. And turns on the radio to his local AM station. And the band played. Right on the radio. It's on the radio. And he listened to the bass line. And the boys in the band sang. Whoa, whoa whoa-wo. Whoa, whoa whoa-wo. (They're so excited about it). Whoa, whoa whoa-wo. (Everybody alright). Whoa, whoa whoa-wo. (And the band played). Whoa, whoa whoa-wo. (and the band played). Whoa, whoa whoa-wo.

tomorrow never knows,"Where the cold wind blows. Tomorrow never knows. Where your sweet smile goes. Tomorrow never knows. You and me, we been standing here my dear. Waiting for our time to come. Where the green grass grows. Tomorrow never knows. In the field your long hair flowed. Down by the Tildenberry tracks. There 'neath the water tower. I carried you on my back. Over the rusted spikes of that highway of steel. Where no more thunder sounds. Where the time goes. Tomorrow never knows. He who waits for the day's riches will be lost. In the whispering tide. Where the river flows. Tomorrow never knows"

trouble in paradise,"You do the drying, I'll do the dishes. Who'll do the crying when all the wishes don't come true. You do the washing, I'll do the folding. Whose heart is breaking. When whose arms are holding someone new. Sittin' on a peaceful lake sunnin'. Didn't hear the roar of the waterfall coming. When it's all a storybook story. When it's all so easy and nice. Here comes trouble in paradise. You did the dusting, I did the sweeping. You did the driving oh and I did the sleeping a little too long. On a picnic 'neath the sky so blue. We didn't see the rain and heartache coming through. When it's all an old black and white movie. And you're sure you've seen the ending twice. Here comes trouble in paradise. You said everything was fine. I'm sorry, baby, I didn't see the signs. Oh so beautifully you read your lines. But in a play where the hero has no vice. And love comes without a price. So does trouble in paradise. Don't matter who did the dusting or who did the sweeping. Who did the trusting or who did the cheating when it's all gone. Laying in a field on a summer's day. Waitin' for those gray skies to clear away. Knowing all love's glory and beauty. Can vanish before you think twice. Leaving trouble in paradise. Now we share the laughing, we share the joking. We do the sleeping with one eye open."
trouble river (i can't keep from crying),"Well, the river runs through this valley. Combing deep and black [?]. Coming like a tombstone's. Shadows across my back. Trouble River. Six foot high and risin'. Trouble River. I can't keep from cryin'. Woke up last night a'shakin'. Shakin' from a dream. All I seen was smilin' faces. Starin' back at me. Trouble River. Six foot high and risin'. Trouble River. I can't keep from cryin'. Snakes crawling in the house. I'm stuck in muddy ground. Tonight I'm gonna shed this skin. Cause water's risin' and I goin' down to. Trouble River. Six foot high and risin'. Trouble River. I can't keep from cryin'."
tunnel of love,Fat man sitting on a little stool. Takes the money from my hand while his eyes take a walk all over you. Hands me the ticket smiles and whispers good luck. Cuddle up angel cuddle up my little dove. We'll ride down baby into this tunnel of love. I can feel the soft silk of your blouse. And them soft thrills in our little fun house. Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us. You me and all that stuff we're so scared of. Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love. There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D. I'm laughing at you you're laughing at me. There's a room of shadows that gets so dark brother. It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love. it ought to be easy ought to be simple enough. Man meets woman and they fall in love. But the house is haunted and the ride gets rough. And you've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love.
tv movie,"I woke up last night shaking from a dream. For in that dream I died. My wife rolled over and told me. That my life would be immortalized. Not in some major motion picture.

Yeah they're gonna make a TV movie out of me. Well they can change my name or they can leave it. They can change my story too. Or they can make me black or Chinese. And do things that I never did do. They're gonna give my life a whole new ending. And put me in prime time first-run. And when it's over, what I did there will be what I done. Now I don't want my name in a history book. Nobody's ever gonna see. No, they're gonna make a TV movie out of me. (CHORUS). Well I'm a shoe-in for a sponsor. Goodyear blimp and radial wheels. Somebody had a meeting somewhere. Somehow somebody made a deal. Well I was one of them kinds of stories. That everybody liked to see. Yeah they're gonna make a TV movie out of me. Now I don't want no inscription on my gravestone. No long soliloquy. No they're gonna make a TV movie out of me. (CHORUS)."

two faces,I met a girl and we ran away. I swore I'd make her happy every day. And how I made her cry. Two faces have I. Sometimes mister I feel sunny and wild. Lord I love to see my baby smile. Then dark clouds come rolling by. Two faces have I. One that laughs one that cries. One says hello one says goodbye. One does things I don't understand. Makes me feel like half a man. At night I get down on my knees and pray. Our love will make that other man go away. But he'll never say goodbye. Two faces have I. Last night as I kissed you 'neath the willow tree. He swore he'd take your love away from me. He said our life was just a lie. And two faces have I. Well go ahead and let him try.
two for the road,"It's one for the money, one for the show. I got one kiss for you honey so come on let's go. I didn't see it coming but girl now I know. It takes one for the running but two for the road. One thousand dreams whispered in the dark. But a dream's just a dream in one empty heart. It takes more than one to rev it up and go. So let's get it running, we're two for the road. Two one-way tickets and a diamond ring. Hell it don't matter what the rain might bring. When this world treats you hard and cold. I'll stand beside you, we're two for the road. When you're alone my love will shine the light. Through the dark and starless night. I'll hold you close and never let you go. Come on now honey, we're two for the road. I'll stand beside you and I'll never go. Come on now girl, we're two for the road."
two hearts,I went out walking the other day. Seen a little girl crying along the way. She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again. Someday your crying girl will end. And you'll find once again. Two hearts are better than one. Two hearts girl get the job done. Two hearts are better than one. Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes. But I was living in a world of childish dreams. Someday these childish dreams must end. To become a man and grow up to dream again. Now I believe in the end. Two hearts are better than one.... Sometimes it might seem like it was planned. For you to roam empty hearted through this land. Though the world turns you hard and cold. There's one thing mister that I know. That's if you think your heart is stone. And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone. Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind. That's why I'll keep searching till I find my special one. Two hearts are better than one....
two hearts in true waltz time,"Well the first frame finds her running. But the night pushes her deep within the tunnel. She camouflages herself in dayglo paint. And she sings her love songs through a funnel. And she clings to the walls like a cat who calls. The shots for life and for death. Wearing nothing but the make-up she uses. To try and cover up for herself. Well if she can't hide her sword. She gives no terms for surrender. 'Cause she's living the Third World War. The Tunnel Police, they steadily increase. The search for where she hides her kid. She swings on a vine across the State Line. they measured the length of her skid. She never goes back to do something she didn't. Or undo something she did. Smoke streams from the street. And the night is complete. With a long and fiery belch. She's just another Orphan Annie cartoon and a Raquel Welch. She rides like Caesar, brandishing a whip. On the hood of his squad car. As the siren wails she silently sails. Leaving footprints in the tar. Oh she breaks with the dawn. And by morning she's gone. Leaving nothing but another night. She returns to her home. Like a dog returns to a bone. Another unsatisfied wife. And there's little Booth. Secure from the truth. He wants her more than he's got the guts to say. 'Cause as she needs to be real. He needs to conceal. The realness of his place. So he sings a little song. And in a chiffon sarong. She performs a black ballet in space. But she's another flop with a fancy name. And he's just another cop with a pretty face. So together they commit the ultimate crime. Two hearts locked in true waltz time."
used cards,"USED CARS. . My sister's in the front seat with an ice. cream cone. My ma's in the back seat sittin' all alone. As my pa steers her slow out of the lot. For a test drive down Michigan Avenue. Now, my ma, she fingers her wedding band. And watches the salesman stare at my old. man's hands. He's telling us all about the break he'd. give us. If he could, but he just can't. Well if I could, I swear I know just what. I'd do. Now, mister, the day the lottery I win. I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car. again. Now, the neighbors come from near and far. As we pull up in our brandnew used car. I wish he'd just hit the gas and let out. a cry. Tell `em all they can kiss our asses. goodbye. My dad, he sweats the same job from. mornin' to morn. Me, I walk home on the same dirty streets. where I was born. Up the block I can hear my little sister. In the front seat blowin' that horn. The sounds echoin' all down Michigan. Avenue. Now, mister, the day my numbers comes in. I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car. again."
valentine's day,I'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark. I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart. It's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through. And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you. A friend of mine became a father last night. When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light. Of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines. And that great jukebox out on Route 39. They say he travels fastest who travels alone. But tonight I miss my girl mister tonight I miss my home. Is it the sound of the leaves. left blown by the wayside. That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight. Is it the cry of the river. With the moonlight shining through. That ain't what scares me baby. What scares me is losing you. They if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed. But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head. And God's light came shinin' on through. I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew. It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me. It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true. It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms. No no baby it was you. So hold me close honey say you're forever mine. And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine.

vigilante man,"Rainy night down in the engine house. Sleepin' just as still as a mouse. A man came along and chase us out in the rain. Well was that a vigilante man?. Stormy days, we pass the time away. Sleeping in some good warm place. A cop come along we give him a little race. Say was that a vigilante man?. Well tell me why does a vigilante man. Tell me why does a vigilante man. Carry that sawed off shotgun in his hands. To shoot his brothers and sisters down that no good vigilante man. Well I ramble around from town to town.

visitation at fort horn,"Behind the walls where heat lightning falls. On five starred gnat-faced princess. The buffalo man shoots at the tin cats. Turns and shouts ""Children, blow your bridges"". On death row halls where dustmen stall. Where time's an enemy and a friend. At night jackals crawl from the cracks in the walls. And salvation is never spoken. Morning sickness breaks the garrison gate. The cavalry cries for treason. The soldier strokes his pony and goes to shine the Captain's sword. In this young boy's eyes lie reason. And the sergeant bursts in and cries ""I caught a prisoner, Captain,. A prisoner, what ho !"". The Captain looks up and says ""Let her go"". ""But Captain, she patrols the light ships that patrol the sea around. The rainbow tips, whose bagpiper wail unbroken. She haunts the night and the dawnin' light. On her sounds and words your cavalry chokin' "". The Captain says ""Have no fear, boys. For what you hear. Because danger can't be spoken "". The whirlwind crackles and I hear the rustle of shackles. From the stockade door bursts Merlin. His eyes red, and swollen, like they've been pushed into the sun. His robes aflame and burnin'. He jumps a horse, tries to get away. But he gets caught in his eyes, tangled in his eyes. He falls to the ground, his neck is broken. His spirit rises high in the western sky. The magician lies an empty token. the sergeant walks over and kicks his body. And says ""Captain, he's dead - What shall we do with him ?"". The Captain says ""Hang him. For though his live moments on this earth are well spent. And I can se his body is sure well bent. It's magic that must be broken "". Now night cradles low. The penniless weed plays wrath felt in the Captain's corner. With anvil spread wide, the Captain glides. Each blow to scare her, not to hurt her. She spits ""what truth"" at the Captain's boots. But he holds his rage suspended. The sergeant comes in stinkin' of soldier's gin. And cries ""Captain, the storm she blows unending"". Oh and the lightning cracked and the sky was hacked. By dagger rain it was torn. And the yard was charged into a raging sea. And the Captain ran crazily. For the first time in his life, in the Captain's heart. Fear was born. The Captain storms out on the stoop, panic strikes. He sees Merlin's hung body stretched by the neck. Silhouetted on his door. The sergeant screams ""Captain, look high, look to the sky !"". Some whirling, swirling emission .... But the Captain falls to his knees crying silent pleas. 'Cause he knows, he knows, and he thinks to himself. ""A Magician...""."

Wages of sin, you keep me paying. Wages of sin for wrongs that I've done. Wages of sin, you keep me paying. Wages of sin, one by one. I walk in the apartment, there's clothes thrown all over the place. You're crouched in the corner with makeup running down your face. I don't wanna believe what my heart keeps saying. You keep me on the line so you can keep me paying. Wages of sin, we keep paying. Wages of sin for the wrongs that we've done. Wages of sin, we keep paying. Wages of sin, that's how we have our fun. I remember when I was a little boy out where the cottonwoods grow tall. Trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls. Baby all the sounds I heard, even if they weren't real. I was running down that broken path with the devil snapping at my heels. I tried so hard, so hard in every way. Swore someday I'd grow up, just throw it all away. Cried all the tears, baby, that I could cry. Stomached all my fears till they came rushin' up inside. Darlin' I'm losin' and it's a mean game. Still I play on and on just the same. Wages of sin, I keep paying. Wages of sin for some wrong that I've done. Wages of sin, well I keep paying. Wages of sin, one by one."
waiting on a sunny day,"It's rainin' but there ain't a cloud in the sky. Must've been a tear from your eye. Everything'll be okay. Funny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze. Must've been you sighin' so deep. Don't worry we're gonna find a way. I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day. Gonna chase the clouds away. Waitin' on a sunny day. Without you I'm workin' with the rain fallin' down. Half a party in a one dog town. I need you to chase the blues away. Without you I'm a drummer girl that can't keep a beat. And ice cream truck on a deserted street. I hope that you're coming to stay. I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day. Gonna chase the clouds away. Waitin' on a sunny day. Hard times baby, well they come to tell us all. Sure as the tickin' of the clock on the wall. Sure as the turnin' of the night into day. Your smile girl, brings the mornin' light to my eyes. Lifts away the blues when I rise. I hope that you're comin' to stay"
walk liike a man,I remember how rough your hand felt on mine on my wedding day. And the tears cried on my shoulder I couldn't turn away. Well so much has happened to me that I don't understand. All I can think of is being five years old following behind you at the beach tracing your footprints in the sand. Trying to walk like a man. By Our Lady Of The Roses we lived in the shadow of the elms. I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church whenever she heard those wedding bells. Well would they ever look so happy again the handsome groom and his bride. As they stepped into that long black limousine for their mystery ride. Well tonight you step away from me and alone at the alter I stand. And as I watch my bride coming down the aisle I pray for the strength to walk like a man. Well now the years have gone and I've grown from that seed you've sown. But I didn't think there'd be so many steps I'd have to learn on my own. Well I was young and I didn't know what to do. When I saw your best steps stolen away from you. Now I'll do what I can. I'll walk like a man. And I'll keep on walkin'.
walking in memphis,"Put on my blue suede shoes. And I boarded the plane. Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues. In the middle of the pouring rain. W.C. Handy -- won't you look down over me.

But do I really feel the way I feel. Saw the ghost of Elvis. On Union Avenue. Followed him up to the gates of Graceland. Then I watched him walk right through. Now security they did not see him. They just hovered 'round his tomb. But there's a pretty little thing. Waiting for the King. Down in the Jungle Room. Then I'm walking in Memphis. I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. Walking in Memphis. But do I really feel the way I feel. They've got catfish on the table. They've got gospel in the air. And Reverend Green be glad to see you. When you haven't got a prayer. But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis. Now Muriel plays piano. Every Friday at the Hollywood. And they brought me down to see her. And they asked me if I would --. Do a little number. And I sang with all my might. And she said --. ""Tell me are you a Christian child?"". And I said ""Ma'am I am tonight"". Then I'm walking in Memphis.

walking in the street,"Oh Billy stares at Cherry in the hall. And walks out into the rain so blessed and tall. Standin' on the corner with a gun underneath his coat. Beneath the stars on the street. Oh on Lexington Avenue they stand. Velvet aces they case the promised land. Reachin' out across the hoods with both hands. Oh, tryin' to catch a ride. Tonight we're lovers in the cold. Running past the graveyards in the snow. Walking in the street with nowhere to go. And it's no, no, no. Oh and the getaway driver waits outside the store. He pulls away just as Billy runs out the door. Oh and Billy won't run anymore, no, no, no. Oh baby I can't lay the stars at your feet. Oh but I think we could take it all, just you and me. Oh come on, you'll see, there's a lot of room. For you baby, in this front seat. Tonight we're lovers on that road (in the snow). Running past the graveyards in the snow. Walking in the street with nowhere to go. And it's oh, oh, oh."
walking through midnight,Well I've been walking through midnight. And there's no trace of dawn. I'm stuck in this moonlight. It's leading me on. My body's on fire. And I can't stand the pain. This burning desire. I feel once again. Now I'm fighting with madness. As I move down the street. Surrounded by sadness. I can't take this heat. The streetlamps are glowing. Like coals in the mist. Their lights keep me moving. I just can't resist. Now there's peace in this valley. But none in my mind. Like a drunk in an alley. I'm stumbling blind. With no destination. At an unholy speed. I must keep on moving. Try to walk off this need.

war nurse,"She was just another war nurse. She could strike a noble pose. Caring for our young boys when a bullet laid them low. She would hover over them and cry. And pull the cover over them when they'd die. She was just another lonesome lady, lover, sister of the gun. And though France would call her darling,. She was a nurse 'neath the rising sun. She knew no hells or heavens, or harbors or havens. She was every mother, sister, wife and lover. Whose love a soldier boy was savin'. She believed in the birth of the broad sword. She was not a shielded one. Though France would call her darlin'. She was nurse 'neath the rising sun. She was a soldier's shrapnel sweetheart, direct from the combat zone. She was a reincarnation o fthe Virgin MAry. She was the hooker down in San Antone. And though her heart was somewhere in Iceland. Commanding the dawn patrol. Blessed in this blood and stitched into these bones. the war nurse left her soul. Blessed in this blood and stitched into these bones. the war nurse left her soul."
we are alive,"There's a cross up yonder up on Calvary Hill. There's a slip of blood on a silver knife. There's a graveyard kid down below. Where at night did come to life. And above the stars, they crackle in fire. A dead man's moon throws seven rings. Well, we put our ears to the cold grave stones. This is the song they'd sing. We are alive. And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark. Our spirits rise to carry the fire and light the spark. To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. A voice cried out, I was killed in Maryland in 1877. When the railroad workers made their stand. Well, I was killed in 1963 one Sunday morning in Birmingham. Well, I died last year crossing the southern desert. My children left behind in San Pablo. Well they left our bodies here to rot. Oh please let them know. We are alive. Oh, and though we lie alone here in the dark. Our souls will rise to carry the fire and light the spark. To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. Let your mind rest easy, sleep well my friend. It's only our bodies that betray us in the end. I awoke last night in a dark and dreamy deep. From my head to my feet, my body had gone stone cold. There were worms crawling all around me. Fingers scratching at an earth black and six foot low. And alone in the blackness of my grave. Alone I'd been left to die. Then I heard voices calling all around me. The earth rose above me, my eyes filled with sky. We are alive. And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark. Our souls and spirits rise. To carry the fire and light the spark. To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. We are alive"

who'll stop the rain,"Long as I remember. The rain been falling down. Clouds of myst'ry pourin'. Confusion on the ground. Good men through the ages. They try to find the sun. But I wonder, still I wonder. Who'll stop the rain. I went down Virginia. Seekin' shelter from the storm. Just caught up in the fable. I watched the tower grow. Five-year plan and new deals. Wrapped in golden chains. Still I wonder, yes I wonder. Who'll stop the rain. Heard the singers playin'. How we cheered for more. The crowd had rushed together. Tryin' to keep warm. Still the rain keeps falling. Fallin' through the years. And I wonder, still I wonder. Who'll stop the rain. I wanna know, baby I wanna know."

Fat lady, big mama, Missy Bimbo sits in her chair and yawns,. And the man-beast lies in his cage sniffin' popcorn and the midget licks his fingers and suffers Missy Bimbo's scorn. Circus town's been born.. And a press roll drummer go, ballerina to-and-fro cartwheelin' up on that tightrope,. With a cannon blast, lightin' flash, movin' fast through the tent, Mars bent,. He's gonna miss his fall, oh God save the human cannonball.. And the flying Zambini's watch Marguarita do her neck twist,. And the ringmaster gets the crowd to count along: 95, 96, 97..

winter songs,"From their northeast source the sour wind roars. Bear gifts fresh from the valley waters.. Hallow echoes strip Pennsylvania mountain walls. With their corsets and their old Betsy ruffle. And their slips with pearly white.. They stand bulging up against the screen door,. A banshee ""Good night."". Summer's sweet and she brings me water,. But give me Winter, that old icy whore.. While Summer lies meek and follows orders,. Winter cries ""Me!"" and pulls you through the door.. The limp milk tramp cries metal-flake tears.. They drip like honey down <soot?> momma's leg.. You lay watchin' them off. Eat a hole in his cloth.. He'll ask, but he don't beg.. Said I'd like to the mademoiselle. Who holds the keys to all these doors around the waist. And rings the bell.. Summer's sweet and she brings me water,. But give me Winter, that old icy whore.. Summer lies meek and follows orders,. Winter cries ""Me!"" and pulls you through the door.. With scufflin' sound, the knot-voiced matron makes her rounds,. Knockin' on each and every door.. With a look like white heat, she sways, salty, sweet. And leads me 'cross her Persian floor.. She squeeze' my hand and before her I stood.. I was scared. It was dark, but it was good.. Summer's sweet and she brings me water,. But give me Winter, that old icy whore.. While Summer lies meek and follows orders,. Winter cries ""Me!"" and pulls me through her door.."
with every wish,"Ol' catfish in the lake, we called him Big Jim. When I was a kid, my only wish was to get my line in him. Skipped church one Sunday and throw'd in my line. Jim took that hook, pole and me right over the side. Went drifting down past old tires and rusty cans of beer. The angel of the lake whispered in my ear. ""Before you chose your wish, son, you'd better think first. With every wish there comes a curse"". I fell in love with beautiful Doreen. She was the prettiest thing this old town'd ever seen. I courted her and I made her mine. But I grew jealous whenever another man'd come walkin' down the line. And my jealousy made me treat her mean and cruel. She sighed, ""Bobby, oh Bobby, you're such a fool. Don't you know before you chose your wish you'd better think first. With every wish there comes a curse"". These days I sit around and laugh at all the rivers I've crossed. But on the far banks there's always another forest where a man can get lost. Well there in the high trees love's bluebird glides. Guiding us 'cross another river on the other side. And there someone is waitin' with a look in her eyes. And though my heart's grown weary, and more than a little bit shy. Tonight I'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst. And leave the angels to worry. With every wish...."
without you,"Monday, I go to work. Tuesday, can't find my shirt. Wednesday, I'm feelin' blue. I'm helpless, darlin'. Without you, without you. Without you, without you. Thursdays, everything's fine. Friday, I'm out of my mind. Friday, I'm out of my mind. Saturday, Sunday too. It's hopeless, darlin'. Without you, without you. Without you, without you. Each and every night of the week. I toss and turn in my sleep. Worryin' if you're all right. Wonderin' where you are tonight."
working on a dream,"Out here the nights are long, the days are lonely. I think of you and I'm working on a dream. I'm working on a dream. Now the cards I've drawn's a rough hand, darling. I straighten my back and I'm working on a dream. I'm working on a dream. I'm working on a dream. Though sometimes it feels so far away. I'm working on a dream. I know it will be mine someday. Rain pourin' down, I swing my hammer. My hands are rough from working on a dream. From working on a dream. I'm working on a dream. Though trouble can feel like it's here to stay. I'm working on a dream. Our love will chase the trouble away. [whistling interlude]. I'm working on a dream. Though it can feel so far away. I'm working on a dream. And our love will make it real someday. The sunrise come, I climb the ladder. The new day breaks and I'm working on a dream. I'm working on a dream. I'm working on a dream. I'm working on a dream. I'm working on a dream. Though it can feel so far away. I'm working on a dream. And our love will make it real someday. I'm working on a dream. Though it can feel so far away. I'm working on a dream. And our love will make it real someday. Li li li li li li. Li li li li li li li. By Luiz Cláudio ;)"
working on the highway,"Friday night's pay night guys fresh out of work. Talking about the weekend scrubbing off the dirt. Some heading home to their families. Some looking to get hurt. Some going down to Stovell wearing trouble on their shirts. I work for the county out of 95. All day I hold a red flag and watch the traffic pass me by. In my head I keep a picture of a pretty little miss. Someday mister I'm gonna lead a better life than this. CHORUS:. Working on the highway laying down the blacktop. Working on the highway all day long I don't stop. Working on the highway blasting through the bedrock. Working on the highway. Working on the highway. I met her at a dance down at the union hall. She was standing with her brothers back up against the wall. Sometimes we'd go walking down the union tracks. One day I looked straight at ther and she looked straight back. CHORUS:. Working on the highway laying down the blacktop. Working on the highway all day long I don't stop. Working on the highway blasting through the bedrock. Working on the highway. Working on the highway. I saved up my money and I put it all away. I went to see her daddy but we didn't have much to say. ""Son can't you see that she's just a little girl. She don't know nothing about this cruel cruel world"". We lit out down to Florida we got along all right. One day her brothers came and got her and. They took me in a black and white. The prosecutor kept the promise that he made on that day. And the judge got mad and he put me stright away. I wake up every morning to the work bell clang. Me and the warden go swinging on the Charlotte County road gang. CHORUS:. Working on the highway laying down the blacktop. Working on the highway all day long I don't stop. Working on the highway blasting through the bedrock. Working on the highway. Working on the highway."
worlds apart,"I hold you in my arms, yeah that's when it starts. I seek faith in your kiss, and comfort in your heart. I taste the seed upon your lips, lay my tongue upon your scars. But when I look into your eyes, we stand worlds apart. Where the distant oceans sing, and rise to the plain. In this dry and troubled country your beauty remains. Down from the mountain roads where the highway rolls to dark. 'Neath Allah's blessed rain, we remain worlds apart. Sometimes the truth just ain't enough. Or it's too much in times like this. Let's throw the truth away, we'll find it in this kiss. In your skin upon my skin, in the beating of our hearts. May the living let us in, before the dead tear us apart. We'll let blood build a bridge, over mountains draped in stars. I'll meet you on the ridge, between these worlds apart. We've got this moment now to live, then it's all just dust and dark. Let love give what it gives. Let's let love give what it gives."
wreck on the highway,"Last night I was out driving. Coming home at the end of the working day. I was riding alone through the drizzling rain. On a deserted stretch of a county two-lane. When I cam upon a wreck on the highway. There was blood and glass all over. And there was nobody there but me. As the rain tumbled down hard and cold. I seen a young man lying by the side of the road. He cried Mister, won't you help me please. An ambulance finally came and took him to Riverside. I watched as they drove him away. And I thought of a girlfriend or a young wife. And a state trooper knocking in the middle of the night. To say your baby died in a wreck on the highway. Sometimes I sit up in the darkness. And I watch my baby as she sleeps. Then I climb in bed and I hold her tight. I just lay there awake in the middle of the night. Thinking 'bout the wreck on the highway."
