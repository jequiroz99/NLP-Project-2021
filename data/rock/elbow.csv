mcgreggor,"Oohhhh. There was lying at the table. Crying on the stairs. A raven on the gables singing. 'Jesus doesn't care'. A woman at the window. With her hands on her hips. Staring out across the ocean. Like the prow of a ship. No blinking or emotion. Like the prow of a ship. Just endevour and devotion. Like the prow of a ship, Ohhh rest in your bed. Oooohhh, McGreggor's dead. The kids were in the kitchen. Carving up the will. where/when the long line of limousines. Snake down the hill. They think they're winning. And shaking hands with the prodigal. And pompous who knew the man. Father figures and motherfuckers. Who knew the man. God's torment at the party. As if God knew the man. Ooohhh, rest in your bed. Ooohhh, McGreggor`s dead. Recall his lies. Pick up the pen. Record his reign. For the bitch that bore him. Is in heat again. Ooohhh"
magnificent (she says),"This is where, this is where the bottle lands. Where all the biggest questions meet. With little feet stood in the sand. This is where the echoes swell to nothing on the tide. And where a tiny pair of hands. Finds a sea-worn piece of glass. And sets it as a sapphire in her mind. And there she stands. Throwing both her arms around the world. The world that doesn't even know. How much it needs this little girl. It's all gonna be magnificent, she says. It's all gonna be magnificent. This is where it all began. To light your mother's cigarette. And I got to touch her hand. And my heart, there defrosting in a gaze. Wasn't built to be that way. Suddenly I understand. There on the sand. Throwing both her arms around the world. The world that doesn't even know. How much it needs this little girl. It's all gonna be magnificent, she says. It's all gonna be magnificent. It's all gonna be magnificent, she says. It's all gonna be magnificent. The echoes slow, the bottle lands. The echoes slow, and there she stands"
my sad captains,"I'm running out of miracles. ? Oh my soul. ? And the streets are lined with one-man shows. ? Oh my soul. ? Corner boys were moved along. ? Oh my soul. ? We're plummeting like crippled crows. ? Oh my soul. ?. ? Oh, long before. ? You and I were born. ? Others beat these benches with their empty cups. ? To the night and the stars. ? To be here, and now, and who we are. ?. ? Another sunrise with my sad captains. ? With who I choose to lose my mind. ? And if it's all we only pass this way but once. ? What a perfect waste of time. ?. ? The BMX apothecary. Oh my soul. The architect of infamy. Oh my soul. For each and every train we missed. Oh my soul. A bitter little Eucharist. Oh, long before.

Though a tiny part just did. And would you tell her. I'm from a long line of survivors. And I'll be swinging with the kids. Keep your sympathy. Don't need the healing to start. You've gone. Gone and made a beautiful hole in my heart. In the corner of the room. In the room we used to love. Of the love we should say this. There were switches never flicked. Long away and far apart.

an audience with the pope,"Sweet Jesus I'm on fire. She has the sweetest, darkest eyes. And when it comes into her eyes. I know iron and steel couldn't hold me. But god I'm easy bruised. But so often a moth to her flame. And the things that she's asked me to do. Would see a senior saint. forgetting his name. I have an audience with the pope. And I'm saving the world at 8. But if she says she needs me, she says she needs me. Everybody's gonna have to wait. Where could she be?. Was that a minute or an hour?. Where could she be?. She turns the hours into days.. Kill me phone, cover the cage. And wait for the doorbell to ring. Where could she be?. No she won't come running. Where could she be?. The world is turning at her pace.. Kill me phone, cover the cage. And wait for the doorbell to ring. I have an audience with the pope. And I'm saving the world at 8. But if she says she needs me, she says she needs me. Everybody's gonna have to wait"
an imagined affair,"A sky as black as regret. Is rolling aside for the blue. Impossible face to forget. These feelings belong in a zoo. She brings the morning. She, she brings the morning sun. So lost in the sound of her voice. I don't even hear the words. When she says, ""Come on get out.. The past will find us out.. Come on get out please. And don't breathe a word."". She brings the morning. She, she brings the morning sun. But all this an imagined affair. While sitting in a bar spilling in a bar. I drink until the doorman is a Christmas tree. And my speech is just a gas leak. She brings the morning. She, she brings the morning sun"

asleep in the back,Were you crushed. Did I rush you. All my time is yours. My twisted heart is yours. The faithless shit is yours. The shameless fits of love that only smother you for moments. Until I fold them up and leave. All yours. (chorus). Oh you had to ask didn't you (x2). Oh you had to know. Show your scars. Not to rush you. The hieroglyphic hints in all the toilet scrawl. Guilty little pins. And all the things I never talk about. Are spilling with the gin. Test how tough you are. All yours. (chorus).

Until you've given in to me. I'm a dog without a collar on. You're a girl in this vicinity. Bitten by the tail-fly. Too many times to change. It's a silent taxi ride away. But it's everything to get you there. You'll know when you are bitten-shy. But still you will return my stare. From a crush of blushing brides-to-be. You barely have a blossom on. Your eyes betray your diaries. I'm a dog without a collar on. I'll take you home. Get you on your own. Sweetness, don't be bashful."

When a tear is knocked. The colour field the colour field. All you need is a piece of mind. But even that is hard to find. It could be under or upper or. On me or down below. Rotting you lost all control. The dream's gotten cold. It's kind of sad. Search your soul. To the colour field the colour field"

A picket fence white 9-5 whos. Just alive. Beyond repair, there is nothing to say. Save some fading regrets. Yet I can't be without this. I want you to be around.. Spit-shone lies, juggled debts. Planted flags and made regrets.. Muddled through all the time. Forgetting you. Cut your teeth and breezed on to. another brothers fickle ways. So why amazed when it don't."

For the sails of a clipper. And the truth never frays a good yarn. But it struck me to say. While so far away. You were with me today. You are here in my head,. In my heart. Dear friends.

Saint Peter in satin, he's like Buddha with mace. He's so mercifully free of the pressures of grace. Saint Peter in satin, he's like Buddha with mace. No, I know I won't forget you.

I blow you a kiss. It should reach you tomorrow. As it flies from the other side of the world. From my room in my fugitive motel. Somewhere in the dust bowl. It flies from the other side of the world. 'I'm tired' I said. 'You always look tired' she said. 'I'm admired' I said. 'You always look tired' she said. Not 'til I can read by the moon.

To give up the ghost in this place. Give me strength.

Sharp blow to the bridge of the nose.
little fictions,A muffled battle cry across the kitchen table. A baffling contretemps. That shakes the day unstable. Confessions from the cab a habit. That I got from dad. The flurry of departure. In a cyclone of cologne. Would often devastate the gate and hedge. And set our tiny teeth on edge. I see it in me now and pledge. To knock it on the head that's what I'll do. A muffled battle cry across the kitchen table. Bridges up portcullis down. And round the tower of babel. I'm babbling in my dreams. Of blue berserkers coming at me. Eyes and tongues and rusty knives. And god almighty laughing at me. From a fat boy fishing chair. I wake to find you laughing there. It's nice to know how much you care. Decided I should spend my life with you.

The world that doesn't even know. How much it needs this little girl. It's all gonna be magnificent, she says. It's all gonna be magnificent. This is where it all began. To light your mother's cigarette. And I got to touch her hand. And my heart, there defrosting in a gaze. Wasn't built to be that way. Suddenly I understand. There on the sand. Throwing both her arms around the world. The world that doesn't even know. How much it needs this little girl. It's all gonna be magnificent, she says. It's all gonna be magnificent. It's all gonna be magnificent, she says. It's all gonna be magnificent. The echoes slow, the bottle lands. The echoes slow, and there she stands"

Staring out across the ocean. Like the prow of a ship. No blinking or emotion. Like the prow of a ship. Just endevour and devotion. Like the prow of a ship, Ohhh rest in your bed. Oooohhh, McGreggor's dead. The kids were in the kitchen. Carving up the will. where/when the long line of limousines. Snake down the hill. They think they're winning.

montparnasse,Hurt and baffled. I simmer and freeze. I'm squeezing my words. Like I'm icing a bomb. Blame me if it gets you to sleep. But mind how you go. As you get 'til you're gone. Your heart could easy power three of me. Should my love get lost in the delivery. May brings a supermoon gold and relentless. And the dog bats of melbourne fall from the blue. Swerving casinos and swatting at memories of you. Don't talk like we were stuck in a lift. Why would I be missing you so violently. We're all the hero when directing the scene. But therapy for liars is a giant ice cream. Your heart could easy power three of me. Should my love get lost in the delivery. The lights on your father's bridge on the harbour. Montparnasse dawn for the sleepless insane. Caught in our personal rain again and again. Serious love for the longest of lives. Not a regret when these mumbles are through. Gatecrashing weddings. And swatting at memories of you

our little boat,"Take a selfish lover for a while. And apply the tricks you learn to all you love. Convince yourself the research was worthwhile. And file it under ""N"" for ""No harm done"".

These are the things that will make you a man. Oh how can I tell you how sorry I am?. I took a selfish lover, no harm done. Forgetting all the gentle love she gave. The single indiscretion weighed a tonne. And it pushed our little boat beneath the waves"

Your sweetheart probably hates me. But I'll send you home. Your dome filled up with love. Love will find you out. Be sure love will find you out. As anybody with a kind word. Would know. It's gonna find you. Fill your boots. Fill your spine. Fill your dome. Fill your eyes. WITH LOVE...
