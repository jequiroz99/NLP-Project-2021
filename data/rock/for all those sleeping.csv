With her I'd spend forever. But she'd never wait. I know I should've walked away. But how could I. Every time I hear her say. One kiss and we'll live forever and always. One kiss and I'll never leave. If one kiss will always keep you here with me. Then I'll lean in, close my eyes and just believe. I used to know a girl. A girl I tried to save. She wore her broken wings. With an angel's grace. And the nights we spent together. Set the sky in flames. With her I'd spend forever. But she'd never wait. I know I should've turned away. But how could I forget all you promised me?. One kiss and we'll live forever and always. One kiss and I'll never leave. If one kiss will always keep you here with me.

2182,"Tonight is the night we become great. The stars will show us the way. Tonight is the night we become great. The stars are what gave us away. All hands on deck this is urgent. This struggle has just begun. The ocean air chills to the bones. The sea offers no mercy. It's so much harder to breathe. When every breath screams your name. The waves they pull me underneath. Not every wave is the same. Death can't reach me if I believe. If I, yes I believe. Now take a breath and fall asleep. Tonight is the night we become great. The stars are what gave us away. We're going down. We've done all that we can. We are buried beneath the waves. I can now only blame myself. What more could I ask. Do you believe your faults. Can be forgiven. Did you live your life. Based on regret. Inhale the salt. That surrounds you. I'm silently screaming. While I am underneath. Now fall asleep. It's so much harder to breathe. When every breath screams your name. The waves they pull me underneath. Not every wave is the same. Death can't reach me if I believe. If I, yes I believe. Now take a breath and fall asleep"
backstabber,Let's get this straight. You're reaching out for me. After all the times you watched me bleed. Now you expect me to put my hand out for you. I'll never stop. I'll never quit.

I'll set you straight. Do you think this is a game. After all the times you walked on me. How can you expect me to have sympathy. Is it so hard to understand. After all the lives you ruined. Some might want revenge. So go on keep smiling. We'll see who has the laugh last. Watch your back. After all the ones you stabbed. You know you're bound to make some enemies like me. It's to late for apologies. You may never regret what you've done. Buy you're going to regret me. I told you this wasn't a game. This is your judgement day. It's me you have to face. I'll never stop. I'll never quit. You deserve everything you're going to get
crosses,"Nothing matters. (Nothing matters). Nothing matters, but the voice inside. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. Nothing matters, in the great divide. Go!. It stars with a spark.

demons,"Why does it seem the songs about hating myself. Are the ones the kids look up to. Well you're in luck because I'm in hell. 'Cause it's not art if it's not dark. And shows the ugly truth. I write all of these songs for me. But the contract I signed sees things differently. But what if I'm not strong enough to be. The broken bastard that I am. And the hero that they need. Do you believe we all have demons?. Do you believe we all have secrets?. Time can feel like flame. But even stars burn out someday. So do you see the stars?. They shine for no one. Between the years of hiding my darkness underneath. And the quest for finding my identity. I can't sleep. Without the bottle to drown my anxiety. I can't sleep. And this insomni-addiction is killing me. Don't look up to me. 'Cause I can only look down on myself. And so would you, if only you ever really knew the real me. I tried to keep my burdens at bay. But a bend's about to break. Because my mouth's grown tired. Of the all the lies and smiles it fakes. But what if I'm not strong enough to be. The damaged desolate I am, and the hero that they need. Do you believe we all have demons?. Do you believe we all have secrets?. Time can feel like flame. But even stars burn out someday. So do you see the stars?. There's a hole at the bottom only I can see. Where my heart once was where it used to be. And now the choir sings. There's a hole at the bottom, time gave to me. Where a darkness grows and the light's fading. And now the choir sings, ""come home to the fire"". Come home to the fire (beg and burn). Do you believe we all have demons?. Do you believe we all have secrets?. Time can feel like flame. But even stars burn out someday. So do you see the stars?. They shine for no one"
drowning for now,"In this water's no reflection. I brace myself for what I see. Now the calm breaks around me and I'm standing face to face. As a bright light surrounds me with a cold embrace. I'll try and break the grasp of the storm raging within. You're drowning. Don't you pretend (that you're not shaking). That this isn't real. Don't you regret (your reflection is fading). The eyes that made you feel. And right before it hits the shore. My struggle begins. My limbs grow weak as I'm treading, defending. My lungs are filling, I've lost the feeling, I'm descending. My eyes swell shut and I can see through memories. Gently fading just release me, please release me. You're drowning. Don't you pretend (that you're not shaking). That this isn't real. Don't you regret (your reflection is fading). The eyes that made you feel. Now above me falling. Cold sweat runs down my face. My finger tips go numb. As I hold onto this place. So I close my eyes. And I collapse to my knees. It all comes over me. As the wind blows through the trees. In this water's no reflection. So I brace myself. And I cannot pretend. That these eyes they made you feel. Now I know what is real. And I know why I'm shaking. I'm alone in this struggle. In this world that I'm making. Don't you pretend. That this isn't real. Don't you pretend (that your not shaking). That this isn't real. Don't you regret (your reflection is fading). The eyes that made you feel. Now I'm letting go and I'm coming home"

We are not innocent. Time takes its time with us tonight. Just breathe. Bleed, like you mean it now. The tracks lead me to where you lay. In absence of light. Tainted snow shines in the night.

Come on baby get your empty lungs. And over the horizon is where you gave your last breath. So I ask you to breathe again breathe. Take a deep breath honey. Dont let this be our last goodbye. Dont let this be our last. Your the silence that ill hear forever"

you belong with me,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend. She's upset, she's going off about. Something that you said. She doesn't get your humor. Like I do. I'm in my room. It's a typical tuesday night. I'm listening to the kind of music. She doesn't like. She'll never know your story. Like I do. But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts. She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole. time. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So why can't you see me. You belong with me. You belong with me.. Walking the streets. With you and your worn out jeans. I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be. Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself. Hey, isn't this easy?. And you've got a smile. That could light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in a while. Since she brought you down. You say you're fine. I know you better than that. Hey what are you doing with a girl like that. But she wears high heels. I wear sneakers. She's cheer captain. I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day. When you wake up and find. That what you're looking for. Has been here the whole time. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So why can't you. See, you belong with me. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor. All this time. How could you not know baby. You belong with me. You belong with me.. Oh, I remember you. Driving to my house. In the middle of the night. I'm the one who makes you laugh. When you know you're about to cry. And I know your favorite songs. And you tell me about your dreams. Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me. Can't you see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So why can't you see?. You belong with me.. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor. All this time. How could you not know baby. You belong with me. You belong with me.. You belong with me. Have you ever thought. Just maybe. You belong with me. You belong with me"
