Until I took a step back, and looked where I was at.. I said ""I'm not really satisfied."". . CHORUS. I wanna' be wild like I'm supposed to be,. Strong and totally free.. I want to be wild [just like/because] I know I am,. Wild just like a natural man .... . Who was born to be wild.. . Wild, born wild, wild the young American style.. Together we are strong, my brother said there ain't no heaven.. There ain't no orders above us.. Now, I don't know why, can get by on a natural high.. My high is the strength of my nature it's a good vibration, now, feeling sensation.. . CHORUS. Who was born to be wild.. CHORUS. ."
winter and my soul,I see a pear falling down from the tree.. Winter is coming and it's plain to see.. I spend the cold nights in my lonely room.. Is it the winter to which I am doomed?. . Cold is the snow that will cover the ground.. I feel the presence of tears falling down.. Is it for pity or pain that I cry?. Color is gone and the grass it must die.. . Winter brings sadness that empties my soul.. Life is too short for a dog growing old.. He used to follow and play at my heels.. Love from his heart I no longer can feel.. .
