I'm gonna hear you saying please wait. You're gonna hear me saying that I waited too long. I'm gonna hear you saying you will pay. You're gonna hear me saying I'm not afraid at all. I need to run away. The joy that you gave me is so fake. Can't you see that I'm awake?. From this illusory dream that I lived for so long. (I cannot be your puppet for any longer)
