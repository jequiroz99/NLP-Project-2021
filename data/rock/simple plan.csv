welcome to my life,"Do you ever feel like breaking down?. Do you ever feel out of place?. Like somehow you just don't belong. And no one understands you. Do you ever want to run away?. Do you lock yourself in your room?. With the radio on turned up so loud. That no one hears you screaming. No you don't know what it's like. When nothing feels alright. You don't know what it's like.

And no one is there to save you. No you don't know what it's like. Welcome to my life. Do you wanna be somebody else?. Are you sick of feeling so left out?. Are you desperate to find something more. Before your life is over. Are you stuck inside a world you hate?. Are you sick of everyone around?. With their big fake smiles and stupid lies. While deep inside you're bleeding. No you don't know what it's like. When nothing feels alright. You don't know what it's like. To be like me.... To be hurt, to feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked when you're down.

No one ever lied straight to your face. And no one ever stabbed you in back. You might think I'm happy. But I'm not gonna be ok. Everybody always gave you what you wanted. You never had to work. It was always there. You don't know whats it's like. What it's like. To be hurt, to feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked when you're down. To feel like you've been pushed around. To be on the edge of breaking down. And no one is there to save you. No you don't know what it's like (what it's like). To be hurt, to feel lost. To be left out in the dark.

Tomorrow morning, different story, and he'll be a different guy. He'll justify her black eye with another lie. She packs her bags, in great temptation. He's on his knees, again he cries. A hug and a kiss and a don't know why as a tear drops from her swollen eye. Apologies until tonight and then another. Justified black eye"

I just can't breathe without you. I never should have let you go. What's on your mind. And tell me what do you see. And tell me who you think of. When you just can't fall asleep. And all the things I took for granted. Moments gone forever. Wasted all the stupid things I did. I'd take them back so tell. Me what to do to make you change your mind.

nostalgic,"I found your picture looking through a book. It was the one I took. When we were driving on Sunset. Descendentes playing on a mix Cd. That you just made for me. You wrote ""For when you miss me"" on it. I can't stop myself when I listen. I always sing along. Reliving every minute. And I just can't take it. I wish that I could forget you even exist. And find a way to, be without you. Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this. It's making me sick. Feeling nostalgic. Every year when October comes around. And it gets colder out. I grab my favorite hoodie. There's still a hole from when you borrowed it. You used to sleep in it. Cause it reminded you of me. Can't stop myself when I'm thinking. I only see your face. Reliving every minute. And I just can't take it. I wish that I could forget you even exist. And find a way to, be without you. Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this. It's making me sick. Feeling nostalgic. I wish that I could forget you even exist. And find a way to, be without you. Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this. It's making me sick. Feeling nostalgic. Maybe someday my heart will be over it. Maybe someday I'll be ok. But I miss you and I hate feeling like this. It's making me sick. Feeling Nostalgic"

I think of all the games that I have played. The unsuspected people that I've hurt. Deep inside I know I don't deserve. Another chance to finally make it work. But I'll try to never disappoint you. I'll try 'til I get it right. I've always been so reckless all of my life. But I'll try for you. I've been the best at letting people down. I've never been the kind of person you could trust. But if you give me half a chance I'll show. How much I can fix myself for you. And I'll try to never disappoint you. I'll try 'til I get it right. I've always been so reckless all of my life. But I'll try for you. This time I won't make up excuses (Cause I don't wanna lose you). Don't give up on me and I'll prove it. I can do this. And I'll try to never disappoint you. I'll try 'til I get it right. I've always been so reckless all of my life. But I'll try for you. Never been the best at honesty. You know that you can never count on me. If you give me half chance I'll show. There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you. I've always been so reckless all of my life. But I'll try for you
untitled,I open my eyes. I try to see but I'm blinded. By the white light. I can't remember how. I can't remember why. I'm lying here tonight. And I can't stand the pain. And I can't make it go away. No I can't stand the pain. How could this happen to me?. I've made my mistakes. Got nowhere to run. The night goes on. As I'm fading away. I'm sick of this life. I just wanna scream. How could this happen to me?. Everybody's screaming. I try to make a sound. But no one hears me. I'm slipping off the edge. I'm hanging by a thread. I wanna start this over again. So I try to hold on to. A time when nothing mattered. And I can't explain what happened. And I can't erase the things that I've done. No I can't. How could this happen to me?. I've made my mistakes. Got nowhere to run. The night goes on. As I'm fading away. I'm sick of this life. I just wanna scream. How could this happen to me?. I've made my mistakes. Got nowhere to run. The night goes on. As I'm fading away. I'm sick of this life. I just wanna scream. How could this happen to me?
vacation,"I know a girl. Who's obsessed with a guy. She talks for hours and still tomorrow. She'll call again. And when he thinks that this could be the end. She calls again. At six in the morning. She waits at the door. He tells her to leave. But still tomorrow she'll be there again. She won't let go. Can't you just go somewhere on vacation. I could book your flight and pack your bags if you want. A one way ticket out of my life. Watching you fly away. I never liked you. She doesn't care if he tries to ignore. He runs away but still she follows. She'll try again. She likes to think she'll get him in the end. Yeah.... Can't you just go somewhere on vacation. I could book your flight and pack your bags if you want. A one way ticket out of my life. Watching you fly away. I never liked you, I never wanted you, I never liked you,. I never wanted you.... Can't you just go somewhere on vacation. I could book your flight and pack your bags if you want. A one way ticket out of my life. Watching you fly away. I never liked you, I never wanted you, I never liked you,. I'm not in love with you"
welcome to my life,"Do you ever feel like breaking down?. Do you ever feel out of place?. Like somehow you just don't belong. And no one understands you. Do you ever want to run away?. Do you lock yourself in your room?. With the radio on turned up so loud. That no one hears you screaming. No you don't know what it's like. When nothing feels alright. You don't know what it's like. To be like me.... To be hurt, to feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked when you're down. To feel like you've been pushed around. To be on the edge of breaking down. And no one is there to save you. No you don't know what it's like. Welcome to my life. Do you wanna be somebody else?. Are you sick of feeling so left out?. Are you desperate to find something more. Before your life is over. Are you stuck inside a world you hate?. Are you sick of everyone around?. With their big fake smiles and stupid lies. While deep inside you're bleeding. No you don't know what it's like. When nothing feels alright. You don't know what it's like. To be like me.... To be hurt, to feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked when you're down. To feel like you've been pushed around. To be on the edge of breaking down. And no one is there to save you. No you don't know what it's like. Welcome to my life. No one ever lied straight to your face. And no one ever stabbed you in back. You might think I'm happy. But I'm not gonna be ok. Everybody always gave you what you wanted. You never had to work. It was always there. You don't know whats it's like. What it's like. To be hurt, to feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked when you're down. To feel like you've been pushed around. To be on the edge of breaking down. And no one is there to save you. No you don't know what it's like (what it's like). To be hurt, to feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked when you're down. To feel like you've been pushed around. To be on the edge of breaking down. And no one is there to save you. No you don't know what it's like. Welcome to my life. Welcome to my life, welcome to my life"

when i'm gone,"I look around me. And all I seem to see. Is people going nowhere. Expecting sympathy. It's like we're going through the motions. Of a scripted destiny. Tell me where's our inspiration. If life won't wait. I guess it's up to me. Whoahh. No we're not gonna waste another moment. in this town. Whoahh. We won't come back, the world its calling out. Whoahh. Leave the past in the past gonna find the future. And misery loves company. Well so long. You'll miss me when I'm gone. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone. Procrastination running circles in my head. While you sit there contemplating you'll wind up left. for dead (left for dead). Life it's what happens. While you're busy making your excuses. Another day, another casualty. But that won't happen to me. Whoahh. No we're not gonna waste another moment. in this town. Whoahh. We wont come back, the world its calling out. Whoahh. Leave the past in the past gonna find the future. And misery loves company. Well so long. You'll miss me when I'm gone. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone. You're gonna miss me when I'm goooone. When I'm gooone. Let's go...!. I won't look back. When I say goodbye. Gonna leave this world behind me. Gonna take what's mine tonight. 'cause every wasted day. Becomes a wasted chance.

when i'm with you,I'm taking my time. I'm trying to leave the memories of you behind. I'm gonna be fine. As soon as I get your picture right out of my mind. I wanna feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you. I wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to. But everytime I call you don't have time. I guess I'll never get to call you mine. You're nothing at all. I know there's a million reasons why I shouldn't call. Nothing to say. Could easily make this conversation last all day. I wanna feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you. I wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to. But everytime I call you don't have time. I guess I'll never get to call you mine. Another lesson. I didn't get to learn. You're my obsession. I got no where to run. I wanna feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you. I wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to. I wanna feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you. I wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to. I wanna feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you.

you don't mean anything,Maybe I'm just not good enough for you. And maybe I just don't wanna be like you. And maybe I just don't wanna know. how low you're ready to go. I'm not gonna change. You can't make me. You don't. You don't. You don't. You don't. You don't mean anything to me. You're what I never want to be. Tell me does it feel good to be like you.

you suck at love,"We started off incredible. Connection undeniable. I swear I thought you were the one forever. But your love was like a loaded gun. You shot me down like everyone. Cause everyone's replaceable. When you're just so incapable. Of getting past skin deep. (Chorus). Guess what, another game over. I got burned but you're the real loser. I don't know why I've wasted my time with you. You're bad news, a history repeater. You can't trust a serial cheater. You're good at hooking up but you suck at love. You played me like an amateur. then stabbed me like a murderer. I'm left for dead, another one of your victims. It's not like you're unpredictable. But your act is so believable. I know it's nothing personal. It's just business as usual. You're good at what you do. (Chorus). Guess what, another game over. I got burned but you're the real loser. I don't know why I've wasted my time with you. You're bad news, a history repeater. You can't trust a serial cheater. You're good at hooking up but you suck at love. Now I kinda feel bad for you. You're never gonna know. What it's like to have someone to turn to Another day, another bed. It's just a game inside your head. (Chorus). Guess what, another game over. I got burned but you're the real loser. I don't know why I've wasted my time with you. You're bad news, a history repeater. You can't trust a serial cheater. You're good at hooking up but you suck at love. (Chorus). Guess what, another game over. I got burned but you're the real loser. I don't know why I've wasted my time with you. You're bad news, a history repeater. You can't trust a serial cheater. You're good at hooking up. You messed this whole thing up. You were such an awesome fuck. But you suck at love. You suck at love"
your love is a lie,"I fall asleep by the telephone. It's two o'clock and I'm waiting up alone. Tell me where have you been?. I found a note with another name. You blow a kiss but it just don't feel the same. Cause I can feel that you're gone. I can't bite my tongue forever. While you try to play it cool. You can hide behind your stories. But don't take me for a fool. You can tell me that there's nobody else. (But I feel it). You can tell me that you're home by yourself. (But I see it). You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want. But I know, I know. Your love is just a lie (lie, lie). It's nothing but a lie (lie, lie). You look so innocent. But the guilt in your voice gives you away. Yeah, you know what I mean. How does it feel when you kiss. When you know that I trust you. And do you think about me when he fucks you. Could you be more obscene. So don't try to say you're sorry. Or try to make it right. And don't waste your breath. Because it's too late, it's too late. You can tell me that there's nobody else. (But I feel it). You can tell me that you're home by yourself. (But I see it). You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want. But I know, I know. Your love is just a lie (lie), lie (lie). It's nothing but a lie (lie), lie (lie). You're nothing but a lie. You can tell me that there's nobody else. (But I feel it). You can tell me that you're home by yourself. (But I see it). You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want. But I know, I know. Your love is just a lie. I know, it's nothing but a lie (lie), lie (lie). You're nothing but a lie (lie), lie (lie). Your love is just a lie"
