dead man's dance,"As the sun fades away from me. The air I breathe gets cold. But I know that my task is here. To protect and serve. (I'll) Take the chance to get along with this.

Justice bastard son. Here I stay. Waiting for the day. Here I stay. Stepping on my own grave. Now the criminal scum is here. Hungry for the gold. They don't know. They shouldn't mess with me.

fear of fear,"For now, there is no place to hide. All I need is to face my pride. Here I am, living day after day. Feeding, growing, running, digging in. Wasting all my life away. It's too cold outside. I didn't choose the hell inside. Surprise, it's doomsday. Take my soul and stay away. I hear voices in my head. And all I wish is to disappear. Last act, last scene. Nightmare wasn't just a dream. It looks pretty real to me. When the world is spinning. And there is nowhere to stay. The blackening begins. So hard to keep it. Seems life will drag me away. My last breath will escape. When walls are closing in. (They) will suffocate me again. Control denied state. Too hard to hold it. I'm going freaking insane. I hear a panic scream. Let me out, settle down. Fear of fear, it's over now. Let me out, settle down. Fear of fear, it's over now. Awakening a monster. Must kill it to live just another day. I've waited, I've wanted.

last day on earth,"So close to the end, now. Life is fading away. I'm not trying to figure out. What I've done is done 'till the grave. Now I can see through the ashes. Through the shades of grey. This cannot change. There is no one who's to blame. I'm losing my senses. In every breath that I take. All the sounds I'm hearing now. Are the dreams that I've left in my brain. Feeling numb in my hands. Out of blood in my veins. This cannot change. Am I falling from grace?. Last day on earth. Will I return?. My soul needs to rest. No links to the past. Death is my rebirth. Last day on earth. Will I return?. There's no need to ask. Let go of your past. Feel your soul burn. I know that I can't change what I am. I know that I can pray 'till the end. As I'm ending this journey. I'm looking back at my life. So many things I could have done. So vivid, burn in my eyes. Now the circle is done. My soul is free to live again. The name carved in the stone. Is now released from the chain. Last day on earth. Will I return?. My soul needs to rest. No links to the past. Death is my rebirth. Last day on earth. Will I return?. There's no need to ask. Let go of your past. Feel your soul burn. Let it burn. Free your soul"

same old song,"I don't wanna see. I don't wanna say. Time stands still. Never walks away. Everything I know. What I used to be. A man without a soul. Ghost memories. Let me out, let me go.

solitude,"Is the flame going to last. With all this cold inside my chest?. My fading soul can never rest. Emptiness has filled my past. My dying kingdom. Forever cursed with solitude. My happy ending. Has failed since I. Haven't found you. Haven't found you. Haven't found you. Haven't found you. A single voice inside my head. Begs the strength that once I had. My bitter tears fall in my bed. Where my dreams are lying dead. My dying kingdom. Forever cursed with solitude. My happy ending. Has failed since I. Here I stand in these dead remains. Of what once used to be a man. Can't clean all these dirty stains. Can't clean it. Here I stand in these dead remains. (The curse is done). Of what once used to be a man. (The sun has gone). Can't clean all these dirty stains. (And now I'm alone). Can't clean it. In my dying kingdom. ""From the same source I have not taken my sorrow. I could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone. And all I loved, I loved alone"" (Edgar Allan Poe). My dead empty eyes reflect despair inside. Struggling with the pain that follows me my whole life. As my perspectives die the sun no longer shines. Shadows embrace these lone forsaken sights. My dry lifeless heart has petrified with time. I can't break through these walls to see the other side. As I stare the remains I'm inert to the rain. Feels like falling over and over again. Here I stand in these dead remains. Of what once used to be a man. Can't clean all these dirty stains. Can't clean it. Here I stand in these dead remains. (The curse is done). Of what once used to be a man. (The sun has gone). Can't clean all these dirty stains. (And now I'm alone). Can't clean it. Here I stand in these dead remains. (The curse is done). Of what once used to be a man. (The sun has gone). Can't clean all these dirty stains. (And now we're alone). Can't clean it"
until the end,"(For those who have eyes to see. For those who have heart to bleed. For the rest of the humankind. This is a message for you to keep. We are dead stars. Looking back up to the sky. And now here we are. Completely lost, into the dark). In this trip around the sun. A billion years from nowhere. We are falling into the edge of the existence. Black holes can be a bridge to another reality. Somewhere there's another you. Here's your déjà vu. Through the unknown. That never ends. What lies beyond. Is in our hands. I saw. Maybe you will see. Until the end of time. Life must die to live. Dust clouds of infinity. Fluctuations of energy. Living legacy of the past. Missing parts of you and me. Nobody seems to understand. Every end shall be born again. We are the universe. And the universe is in us. Through the unknown. That never ends. What lies beyond. Is in our hands. I saw (I saw). Maybe you will see (Maybe you will see). Until the end of time. Life must die to live. What lies beyond the edge of the observable universe?. Could it be the end or the beginning of the route for us?. Singularity. Master of reality. We are the universe. Experiencing itself through consciousness. I saw (I saw). Maybe you will see (Maybe you will see). Until the end of time. Life must die to live. I saw (I saw). Maybe you will see (Maybe you will see). Until the end of time. Life must die to live.
