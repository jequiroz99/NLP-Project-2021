you know my name,If you take a life. Do you know what you'll give?. Odds are you won't like what it Is. When the storm arrives. Would you be seen with me?. By the merciless eyes I've deceived. I've seen angels fall from blinding heights. But you yourself are nothing so divine. Just next in line. (Chorus). Arm yourself because no one else here will save you. The odds will betray you. And I will replace you. You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you. It longs to kill you. Are you willing to die?. The coldest blood runs through my veins. You know my name. If you come inside. Things will not be the same. When you return to the night. And if you think you've won. You never saw me change. The game that we have been playing. I've seen those diamonds cut through harder men. Then you yourself but if you must pretend. You may meet your end. (Chorus). Try to hide your hand. Forget how to feel (forget how to feel). Life is gone. At just a spin of the wheel (spin of the wheel). (Chorus). )
nothing compares 2 u (feat. toni cornell),"It's been seven hours and fifteen days. Since you took your love away. I go out every night and sleep all day. Since you took your love away. Since you been gone I can do whatever I want. I can see who ever I choose. I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant. But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues. Cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. It's been so lonely without you here. Like a bird without a song. Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling. Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong. I could put my arms around every boy I see. But they only remind me of you. I went to the doctor and guess what it told me. guess what it told me. He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun. no matter what you do. "". But he's a fool. Cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. All the flowers that you planted, mama. In your back yard. All died when you went away. I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard. But I'm willing to give it another try. Cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you"
when bad does good,"Standing beside an open grave. You're fate decided, your life erased. Your final hour has come today. Lit by the fire of your temples burning. You were a child and so was I. Now you're a hunter but I am a lion. And I will cut you down like I've done so many times. But sometimes bad can do some good. Sometimes bad can do some good. Sometimes bad can do some good. And I heard you say that flesh sells by the pound. When blood is raining down it cuts a deep river. And I'm diving. Now shine a light down onto the earth. And shake this gold dust out, out of the dirt. No saints beside me and no prayers to guide me. Sometimes bad can do some good. Bad can do some good. Sometimes bad can do some good. (Rain down, heaven is falling). I've chosen a side and I will show no pity. (Rain down, heaven is falling). And spare no lives. For those who try me. (Rain down, heaven is falling). Let it be understood. Sometimes bad can do some good. (Rain down, heaven is falling). Sometimes bad can do some good. (Rain down, heaven is falling). Sometimes bad can do some good"

nearly forgot my broken heart,Every time I stare into the sun. Trying to find a reason to go on. All I ever get is burned and blind. Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain. When you came along the time was right. Pulled me like an apple and ripe. Wasn't very long you took a bite. And did me wrong and it serves me right. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how it broke apart. Here we go round again.... again. Every little key unlocks the door. Every little secret has a lie. Try to take a picture of the sun. It won't help you to see the light. Every little word upon your lips. Makes a little cut where blood pours out. Every little drop of blood a kiss. That I won't miss not for anything. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how it broke apart. Here we go round again. Every single feeling tells me. This is leading to a heart. In broken little pieces. And you know I need this. Like a hole in the head. Every single feeling tells me. This is leading to a heart. In broken little pieces. And you know I need this. Like a hole in the head. And I nearly forgot my broken heart. It's taking me miles away. From the memory of how broke apart. Here we go round again. Here we go round again. Here we go round again.

You're just gonna have to take it. With his arms around your love (x3). Oh, yeah. Pretend that you don't mind. But you know everything that you left behind. And it would have been alright.

seasons,"Summer nights and long warm days. Are stolen as the old moon falls. My mirror shows another face. Another place to hide it all. Another place to hide it all. And I'm lost, behind. The words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As seasons roll on by. Sleeping with a full moon blanket. Sand and feathers for my head. Dreams have never been the answer. And dreams have never made my bed. Dreams have never made my bed. And I'm lost, behind. The words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As the seasons roll on by. When I wanna fly above the storm. But you can't grow feathers in the rain. And the naked floor is cold as hell. This naked floor reminds me. Oh the naked floor reminds me. And I'm lost, behind. Words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As the seasons roll on by. If I should be short on words. And long on things to say. Could you crawl into my world. And take me worlds away. Should I be beside myself. And never even stay. And I'm lost behind. Words I'll never find. And I'm left behind. As the seasons roll on by"

Understand that I won't give one inch of ground. From beneath yours and my feet. Whatever the price happens to be. I may not be the keeper of the flame. But I am the keeper. Beauty and truth colliide where love meets genocide. Where laughter meets fear. Confusion all around as I try to feed these mouths. That have never known singing. And before I let one more tear hit the ground. I will be the one standing between you and the sound. Of the rounds echoing out. Out of the dark. The smoke and the spark. Aimed at the heart of the flame. I am the keeper. I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel tonight. My eyes are weary. And before I let one more life get erased. From the ashes I will rise for you and the ghosts. Of the names, faces, and frames. The love and the pain. For you I will remain. Though I'm not worthy of being the keeper of the flame. I am the keeper. Yeah. I am the keeper"
scar on the sky,"As I fall I leave this scar upon the sky. A simple note for you, I'll wait for your reply. And in your answer I'll regain my will to try. So hover in the diving light. We will rip the night. Out of the arms of the sun one more time. Close your eyes and we will fly. Above the clouded sky. And over the dumbstruck world we will run. In these hills they wash the golden grains away. To the valley under all of this I lay. And may you dig me out unearthed and saved. So hover in the diving light. We will rip the night. Out of the arms of the sun one more time. Close your eyes and we will fly. Above the clouded sky. And over the dumbstruck world we will run. We can rip the night. Out of the arms of the sun.

only these words,"In a castle. Down a long road. A little girl was born. To a king and. To a queen and. Her mother's eyes welled up with tears of joy. Staring at the tiny face. Of a miracle she made. She would say 'I love you'. She would say 'I love you'. Summer came and went. Unrolling trees all stripped to the bone. Daddy's little girl in his arms, well. They sit upon his throne. Who is that thief hiding in the dark?. Just a little girl who stole his heart. He would say 'I love you'. He would say 'I love you'. He would say 'I love you'. With only these three words repeating. A simple greeting but it's all you will keep. Clever lips can be misleading. A tongue can fly away. And won't come back. But it's only these words we recognize. Six o'clock a. m. The alarm rings out. Awoken from the dream. No more castle down a long road. No more kings and no more queens. But she's a princess nonetheless. And a handsome prince is what she'll get. He will say 'I love you'. He will say 'I love you'. He will say 'I love you'. He will say 'I love you'. He will say 'I love you'"

before we disappear,[Verse 1]. Time ain't nothing if it ain't fast. Taking everything that you ever had. And giving nothing in return. But a cold bed in a quiet earth. [Pre-Chorus]. But there's a door in every cell. A pearl inside of every shell. [Chorus]. How hard can it be. To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long when it feels like. We'll live forever I fear. That time will hide the years. [Verse 2]. Life ain't nothing if it ain't hard. It'll show you who you truly are. Knock you down when you get too tall. Till you spun around in a free fall. [Pre-Chorus]. But somewhere out there past the storm. Lies the shelter of your heart. [Chorus]. So how hard can it be. To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long when it feels like. We live for ever I fear. Like we were never here. So hold on tightly my dear. [Bridge].

two drink minimum,This open promise fades. And the sun forgets to rise. I'm lonely and I'm thirsty. But it's better I stay dry. No more than two drinks away from crying. Stare into the glass. And wait for the time to pass. And thank you for the offer. But you know I must decline. Never more than two drinks away from crying. There used to be a time. when I could hold my head up high. My life stretched out before me. Rivers flow with wine. I had my love beside me. And everything was fine. Now the ride is over. It's hard to say goodbye. This whole promise fades. And midnight turns to day. I'd love to drown my sorrow. But I cannot tell a lie. No more than two drinks away from crying
a day in the life (the beatles cover),"I read the news today oh boy. About a lucky man who made the grade. And though the news was rather sad. Well I just had to laugh. I saw the photograph. He blew his mind out in a car. He didn't notice that the lights had changed. A crowd of people stood and stared. They'd seen his face before. Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords.. I saw a film today oh boy. The English Army had just won the war. A crowd of people turned away. But I just had a look. Having read the book, I'd love to turn you on.... Woke up, fell out of bed,. Dragged a comb across my head. Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,. And looking up I noticed I was late.. Found my coat and grabbed my hat. Made the bus in seconds flat. Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,. And Somebody spoke and I went into a dream. I heard the news today oh boy. Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire. And though the holes were rather small. They had to count them all. Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.. I'd love to turn you on."
arms around your love,"With his arms around your love. Oh no, here comes the pain that you can't ignore. With his arms around your girl. He'll do all of the things you didn't do before. You had every chance, but you closed the door. Now you're just gonna have to take it. (Cause if you didn't know). She's gonna make you pay for it. (At a price you can't afford). You're just gonna have to take it. With his arms around your love (x3). Oh, yeah. Pretend that you don't mind. But you know everything that you left behind. And it would have been alright. If you'd gave half of the praise that you held inside. You thought she'd hang around for the ride. Now you're just gonna have to take it. (Cause if you didn't know). She's gonna make you pay for it. (At a price you can't afford). You're just gonna have to take it. With his arms around your love (x3). Coming clean feels so dangerous. Just a little bit would have been enough. But you never said all the words caught in your head. As if your heart was dead. Well now its surely bled and broken up. And it would have been alright. If you'd gave half of the praise that you held inside. You thought she'd hang around for the ride. Now you're just gonna have to take it. (Cause if you didn't know). She's gonna make you pay for it. (At a price you can't afford). You're just gonna have to take it. With his arms around your love"
before we disappear,[Verse 1]. Time ain't nothing if it ain't fast. Taking everything that you ever had. And giving nothing in return. But a cold bed in a quiet earth. [Pre-Chorus]. But there's a door in every cell. A pearl inside of every shell. [Chorus]. How hard can it be. To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long when it feels like. We'll live forever I fear. That time will hide the years. [Verse 2]. Life ain't nothing if it ain't hard. It'll show you who you truly are. Knock you down when you get too tall. Till you spun around in a free fall. [Pre-Chorus]. But somewhere out there past the storm. Lies the shelter of your heart. [Chorus]. So how hard can it be. To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long when it feels like. We live for ever I fear. Like we were never here. So hold on tightly my dear. [Bridge]. I'm not one to waste my time. Searching for something lightning. Somewhere out there lies the stone. Lies the shelter. Of your heart. [Chorus]. So how hard can it be (how hard). To share your love with me?. How hard can it be. To rise with me each morning. How long it feels like. We will live forever. But I fear. That time can hide the years. Like we were never here. So hold on tightly my dear. [Outro]. Before we disappear. Before we disappear
bend in the road,Put a bend in the road. I'm too lost and tired. To see where I'm going. What I left behind. And I'm moving so slow. Don't know when I'll arrive. So put a bend in the road. I'm growing tired of straight lines. I set off for the shore. And I finally slipped away. From the ones I adored. And the place I was raised. And I rode down the road. Just to watch it go by. And when and where is love?. Maybe nowhere tonight. Everyone needs a touch. Or a shoulder for crying. They say love is a crutch. They say love is blind. And that's all that she needed. But I could not supply. When a bend in the road. Put it out of my mind. There was a strange little girl. Who was everything I ever dreamed. I could love or be loved by. So put a bridge or a hill. Or a forest of pines. Or a river of blue. I can run along side. And I'll sleep when it's night. I follow all the signs. Just put a bend in the road. I'm growing tired of straight lines. Put a bend in the road. I'm growing tired of straight lines

black hole sun,"In my eyes. Indisposed. In disguise. As no one knows. Hides the face. Lies the snake. The sun. In my disgrace. Boiling heat. Summer stanch. 'Neath the black. The sky looks dead.

can't change me,She can do anything at all. About anything she pleases. If I were to change what she thinks is wrong. What could she want with me?. . But wait just one minute here. I can see that she's trying to read me. Suddenly I know. . She's going to change the world. But she can't change me. No she can't change me. . She has the daylight at her command.

circling,Night falls while drunken angels. Sleep by the side of the road. Now nodding in the stale world. Just trying to stay out of the cold. Circling around the drain. Can't find my way back home. The road is long and never ends. Dark is the heart that wanders. Light breaks in through the window. Takes a minute to know where I am. A dying blackbird gives his soul to the wind. On the roof of the house that I can see from my bed. Circling around the drain. Show me the way back home. The road is long and never ends. Dark is the heart that wanders. I crawl a hundred thousand miles. Just to see your two eyes look me over. I'd steal you flowers in the bloodshot light. Of the lonely hours of the moonless night. Just like a stray dog in the rain. I can run all night and get nowhere. I picture you out underneath the porch light. Calling my name and now you're waiting for me. I thought I heard your voice in the water. As I walked by a fountain uptown. Now I'm just an orphan left at the door of a church. Just watching the water calm down. Circling around the drain. Hope that I make it home. I've never felt so far away. Dark is the heart that wanders
cleaning my gun,"You and I went deeply, you and I went far and wide. You and I went gently, you and I went for a ride. But somewhere in the ashes of this burning lovers' game. Somehow you've decided that you would find another flame. And as you lay sleeping with your eyes softly shut. I will be cleaning my gun. Cleaning my gun. When heaven or hell takes this life. I'll be done. You never lied to me, never said you'd be around for long. But somehow I believed that you would be my only one. Cause you know where I'm going, and you know where I'm coming from. But now this train is slowly coming to its final destination. And as you lay sleeping with your eyes softly shut. I will be cleaning my gun. Cleaning my gun. When heaven or hell takes this life. I'll be done. Cleaning my gun. Cleaning my gun. When heaven or hell takes this life. I'll be done. And as you lay sleeping with your eyes softly shut. I know it ain't me that you're dreaming of. Mother always told me love would save me from myself. Daddy always said that love would take me straight to hell. Sometimes they were righteous and sometimes they were oh so wrong. Cause I'm cleaning my gun. Cleaning my gun. When heaven or hell takes this life. I'll be done. Cleaning my gun. Cleaning my gun. When heaven or hell takes this life. I'll be done. When heaven or hell takes this life. I'll be done"
climbing up the walls,"I KEEP SEEING your face. When my eyes are closed. I'm remembering how it use to go. Over medicated. Nearly comatose. Going out of your head. YOU'RE STILL ON that road.

dead wishes,Staring in the mirror with two borrowed eyes. Looking for a part of me that's still alive. Waiting for my chest to fall and rise. Standing on the corner with my shirt tucked in. Summer turns to autumn. winter turns to spring. And it all flies by. Like a speeding train. Dead wishes on a broken chain. White roses in a dead man's dream. Down and out. With everything to lose. If these long dead wishes. Never do come true. Waiting for the night to come and chase away. All the flies hovering around my head. With my memories for a pillow. And all my regrets for a bed. Standing on the corner now I'm passed surprise. Yelling out a warning to some passer by. I stand just as God made me. And I lie down in disguise. Dead wishes on a burning lake. White roses for my soul to keep. Diving down with everything to win. If my long since sunken ship. Ever does come in. Down and down we all fall down. And that's how ancient mountains crumble. Time keeps moving slower. Like falling from the sun. Come and knock me over. I keep getting up. Throw a line down to me. Keep hanging on. Standing on the corner don't apologize. You don't have to bow your head or raise your eyes. Or pretend that you don't see me. Dead wishes on a broken chain. White roses in a dead man's dream. Down and out. With everything to lose. If these long dead wishes. These long dead wishes. Ever do come true. Down and down we all fall down. And that's how ancient mountains crumble
disappearing act,come on now the curtain is drawn. and tomorrow stands before you. dressed and draped in a cold black cape. like a crow he ignores you. look again there's a beautiful girl. covers sin in a holy land shroud. it's the great disappearing act. done again for the marveled crowd. as we're chasing our tails. and biting our nails. so strong and frail. and we build and tear it down. with barely the time to say. how did it get so late. i'll never know. step outside and now the doors open wide. and the minions are eager to find him. put a million miles under your heals. and you're still behind him. cover your clocks with your chains and your locks. while the seasons get hotter and colder. stretch your faces and lie about your ages. and still you're going to get older. as we're chasing our tails. and biting our nails. so strong and frail. and we build and tear it down. with barely the time to say. how did it get so late. i'll never know. hang on till your fingers break. and your hands unwind. he will escape you every time. from under your pillows. through open windows. and out on the rails. and we build and tear it down. with barely the time to say. how did it get so late. i'll never know
disappearing one,What have you done my little spark. Cursing my name cause again I put you out. Falling apart you tell yourself you are. Dreaming only of the ones who never dream of you. I'm your disappearing one. Vanish when the curtains drawn. But I will come again and you will let me in. And you'll see I never disappear for long. Into your room I stumble now. Too tired to cower and it's too late to draw you out. And there you lie like a painting of Christ. Bleeding on the heads of the ones who nailed you down. I'm your disappearing one. Vanish when the curtains drawn. But I will come again and you will let me in. And you'll see I never disappear for long.
doesn't remind me,I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. With a graveyard tan carrying a cross. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like studying faces in a parking lot. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like driving backwards in the fog. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything.

Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues. Cause it doesn't remind me of anything. The things that I've loved the things that I've lost. The things I've held sacred that I've dropped. I won't lie no more you can bet. I don't want to learn what I'll need.... Bend and shape me. I love the way you are. Slow and sweetly. Like never before. Calm and sleeping. We won't stir up the past. So descretely. We won't look back. The things that I've loved the things that I've lost. The things I've held sacred that I've dropped. I won't lie no more you can bet. I don't want to learn what I'll need.... I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars.

Days. How would I know. That this could be. My fate
finally forever,On the silent night so out of place. I almost lost my nerve. When I saw you walk into my space. A woman like you I could not replace. And it took some patience to catch your eye. Patience to win your heart. Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all. It's finally forever. There's no hill I would not climb for you. No bridge I wouldn't cross. Not a moment passes in my life. That you're not on my mind. Together or apart. And it took some patience to catch your eye. Patience to win your heart. Now it feels like I don't have to worry at all.

And butterflies across your cheek. Forget how soon you become a fool for words when i. speak. Flutter Girl you don't wanna know what i live. You don't wanna take what I give.

follow my way,"Little one don't be a fool, I'm a wreck when I look mighty. In euphoria I'm bruised, in confusion next I'm lightning. In complacence I am small, through oblivion I charge. So follow my way, when I'm not leading anyone. Open and frayed, when you can see that I'm unsure. Out on my way, I'm only pure when I get lost. And you're only needing, when you're finding that I'm not. You're just looking for a boy, bathed in infrared and sunlight. I'm all polish and reward, when I'm confidant I'm hopeless. Just like everybody else, right before they fall apart. So follow my way, when I am falling from your heart. When I'm the pain, fever and sweet relief in one. Out on my way, though I'm not worthy of your trust. Follow me down into a swan dive, all eyes closed tightly. Lowly, slowly, now I know, I like where you go when you're gone. Warm your hands inside my veins, I might be contagious. Through oblivion I charge. Follow my way, when I'm useless to your cause. When I derail, calm in the patience of remorse. Out on my way, out on my empty open nerves. When all you know, is that I don't know where we are. When all you know, is that I don't know. Follow my way."

He doesn't live here anymore

Dying here on bended knees. Like a raven in a cage. Blood on my birth. Just won't wash away. Like a stitched together doll. My feet to the flame. As I follow the blame. For someone else's pain. For someone else's pain. Rivers of black ink flood. A tapestry of flesh and blood around my frame. A living shrine just for you of human mind. Golden pen upon your hand. Leave this endless winter behind. My sweet josephine. Won't you come and marry me?. I got every single kind of love. That you would ever need. Dying here on bended knees. Dying here on bended knees. Dying here on bended knees. My Josephine
just like suicide,Heard it from another room. Eyes were waking up just to fall asleep. Love's like suicide. Dazed out in a garden bed. With a broken neck lays my broken gift. Just like suicide. And my last ditch. Was my last brick. Lent to finish her. Finish her. She lived like a murder. How she'd fly so sweetly. She lived like a murder. But she died. Just like suicide. Bit down on the bullet now. I had a taste so sour. I had to think of something sweet. Love's like suicide. Safe outside my gilded cage. With an ounce of pain. I wield a ton of rage. Just like suicide. With eyes of blood. And bitter blue. How I feel for you. I feel for you
killing birds,"I learned long ago. 'bout a better way of killing birds. And what it means when they die in my hands. Like a strangled heart. It never made much sense to me.

Killing birds. You don't have to love the murderer I've become. If I could spin a web. I would sit and wait for you. I wouldn't need a stone, I'd just poison you and tie you up. And you would be a bird. A beautiful cresent one. And your eyes would beg. But i'm just doing my job. Standing here in front of you. Standing right in front of you. Standing here in front of you. Standing right in front of you. Standing here in front of you. Standing right in front of you. Standing here in front of you. Killing birds"
let your eyes wander,"When you find love. And it gets away. If it comes back to you. Then it will stay. Well maybe it's true. As dumb as it sounds. I ain't gonna stop you. From looking around. So let your eyes wander. Wild and free. Sooner or later. You will look back. To me. Love can be sharp. Make no mistake. Flatter a good heart. Then watch it break. It'll cut you to the bone.

And I'll look no further. You will come back one day. Followed every word that I have ever heard. And I still don't know what to say. I always think I'm losing. When my lips are moving. Time to shut up anyway. Followed every line. That I remember trying. But they never worked in the end. No more need for talking. If you feel like walking. You're gonna walk anyway. I know you can tell. The difference between. One lonely tear falling. And a season of rain. So let your eyes wander. Wander away. Your heart is young. And longing to stray. Let your eyes wander. Wild and free. Sooner or later. They will look back. They will look back. They will look back. To me"

Awoken from the dream. No more castle down a long road. No more kings and no more queens. But she's a princess nonetheless. And a handsome prince is what she'll get. He will say 'I love you'.

And put the grey back in the clouds. And send them packing with our bags. Of old regrets and sorrows. 'Cause they don't do a thing but drag us down. So far down. The past is like a braided rope. Each moment tightly coiled inside. I saw you suffering. Through the yellow window of a train. With everybody watching, yeah. Too tired for imagining. That you could ever love somebody else.

wave goodbye,Words get tangled on your tongue. And you stumble on your feet when you miss somebody. And everywhere you think you see them. Walking down the street when you miss somebody. When you miss somebody you tell yourself. a hundred thousand times. Nobody ever lives forever so you give it one more try. To wave goodbye wave goodbye. Every hurtful thing you ever said is ringing in your ear. When you miss somebody. And every thing of beauty that you see only brings a tear. When you miss somebody. When you miss somebody you tell yourself everything. will be alright. Try to stand up strong and brave when all you want to do. Is lay down and die. How long I've waited for an answer or a sign. Lonely and weary from this troubled task of trying. To wave goodbye. So now you start to recognize that every single path you see. Leads to a tear in your eye. So wave goodbye wave goodbye..

And I will replace you. You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you. It longs to kill you. Are you willing to die?. The coldest blood runs through my veins. You know my name. If you come inside. Things will not be the same. When you return to the night. And if you think you've won. You never saw me change. The game that we have been playing. I've seen those diamonds cut through harder men. Then you yourself but if you must pretend. You may meet your end. (Chorus). Try to hide your hand. Forget how to feel (forget how to feel). Life is gone. At just a spin of the wheel (spin of the wheel). (Chorus). )
you never knew my mind,"I know you feel the way I change. But you can't change the way I feel. Sometimes I'm a stranger to you. One of a kind. And I think someway you'll make it. Though you don't know how to take it. Sometimes you're a stranger to me. One of a kind. There were times of lots of laughter. And you felt you understood. We were carefree, open and honest. Loving easy, kind and true. And I suppose you never doubted. That we were all together fine. You never really knew my mind. You never really knew my mind. My silence holds the secrets. When I answer but don't answer. You did not see me well enough. To recognize the signs. You didn't want to notice. Or know that it was over. I did not see you well enough. To recognize the signs. And there were times of lots of laughter. And you felt you understood. We were carefree, open and honest. Loving easy, kind and true. And I suppose you never doubted. That we were all together fine. Then you saw the changes painfully. And you knew, you never really knew my mind. And I suppose you never doubted. That we were all together fine. Sometimes I'm a stranger to you. And sometimes you're a stranger to me. Sometimes, maybe all the time. You never really knew my mind. I never really knew your mind"
your soul today,Sleeping on the road that takes you home. Howling at the moon at midnight. I want the wrong that sets you right. I'll be praying at your bedside. How long i've been a soul in the gutter. I don't have a home or a mother or anywhere to lay my head down. Can I visit your arms?. Can i visit your legs?. I won't need your insults or praise. Won't burn in your heart. Don't worry your head. Yeah if you don't want a soul mate. I'm your soul today. Hanging on a rope from a burning tree. Singing on a broken headstone. Bleeding from an old wound. Swimming in the fever. Waiting for a ressurection. I know it's a miracle I've lived this long. I don't want to give the wrong impression. But I've come so far. Can I visit your arms?. Can I visit your legs?. I won't need your insults or praise. Won't burn in your heart. Don't worry your head. Yeah if you don't want a soul mate. I'm your soul today. Sleeping on the road that takes you home. Howling at the moon at midnight. I want the wrong that sets you right. I'll be praying at your bedside. How long I've been a soul in the gutter. Can I visit your arms. Can I visit your legs. I won't need your insults or praise. Won't burn in your heart. Don't worry your head. Yeah if you don't want a soul mate. Can I visit your arms?. Can i visit your legs?. I won't need your insults or praise. Won't burn in your heart. Don't worry your head. Yeah if you don't want a soul mate. I'm your soul today. Your soul today
