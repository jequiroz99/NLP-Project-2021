A misery show without an end. The masses follow the masses. The blind will lead the way. To see the colors that rest within your mind. The paradise we seek lies inside. Who's to blame, who will lose. Now the dice have been rolled. We must find the guilty ones. Instead of condemning what has been done. Who shall we praise now. When all our gods are gone. Living is not just to live. In a conrete or cardboard box. Think in a carbonized world. Where all has been done before. The thought of a perfect world. On the pile of broken dreams. To see the colors that rest within your mind.

From the smoking cities we shall rise. And on the ashes we will build. Praying for that one day"

Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes. In the wasteland that grows inside. Within me I shall find myself. For years of space technology. Still we haven't learned. Like children we explore. Things we can't yet comprehend. Open the doors of the past. With the beating of a heart. Dream as the years go by. Carrying our own cross. Seek the answers in the skies. As we don't even know ourselves."
gemini i,"On the day that you woke me up. From our dream to your nightmare. I didn't know it was possible to feel so alone being with you. I tried to move, but you glued me to your side,. With all that you gave me. Did you catch the moon together. When I saw the look upon your face. I knew we had lost precious hours through our days. Did her skin feel as soft as you always said. mine are to your fingers?. Did her eyes look as deep into your soul. as you always said mine did. Hunting down all my strength to reveal that. clouds have appeared for regression. I tried to move but you've glued me to. your side with all that you gave me. Will I find my way home. When I saw the look upon your face. I knew we had lost precious hours through our days"

golden grounds,As the sand. spreads wide open. and the glow of the sun. pearls the skin. All hope is craving fluids. and the yearning to where we've been. Golden grounds. so absorbing. When the heat of the sun. boils the skin. We have to stand the test of nature. to return to where we've been. Hold on my saviour. Keep my heart in holy dimensions. Drag me on your back. for one more day. One more day. One more day. You give. You learn. You live. You learn. I guess what ever you may find. It's all right to eat a piece of your mind.

great ocean road,It is all there. The earth and the ocean. They contain the power. of our lives. This beautiful city. that surrenders. to the nightfall. Carving the grounds. we walk upon. And the air. We all dare. to ride it somehow. Blue and black is the sky. While tumbling down. Trapped into the freedom. of an aeroplane. Deprived of sleep. we jump into the deep. With no knowledge whatsoever. There is no place. on the face. of this earth. Only silence. is the sound.

I curse the damned who just laugh in you face. Give me permission to rearrange. Just laugh in your face. Drawing blood from people. People that are in pain."
her last flight,"Can't do that, please forget. The things I need, there's more than only to breath. Twisted and dreams, crying and defeat. Love and fear, Buried beneath those facts. Which controle, it's all there. Sent me grief, sent me joy. To become myself, trying to gather the truth. Eternal faith, blame myself. Pleasing the one, from inside. Cause there is where it's at, take my breath. Wet my eyes, turn me inside out and never lie. And if you cry, I'll take the side. That needs in the first place. Be my guest, I will not push. I will not try to take more than you want. Cause what would you have done if the truth. was done wrong. And please forget, we can't have those thing. And please forget, we'll act like we've just met. And please forget, we can do it all over again. Please forget we'll act like we've just met. I don't wanna do it right."

In my universe where storms run. Falling, falling, falling, fall into me. I hear echoes of my speech. And I see shadows of my walk. I feel the past. I always look backwards. Fighting, floating. Tasting blood in my mouth. Ancient damp painting ruins. Feel the rising chill. I listened to the sound of your airs. We're watching stone saints fall over. While the black crows will be taking to the sky. Falling, falling, falling, fall into me. I hear echoes of my speech. And I see shadows of my walk. I feel the past. I always look backwards. (II). My heart is drifting through all shades of green. My head is thinking through meadows of the sea. Lonely as I am. Expanding the scene where I've never (ever) been. A promise at last to call back the past. To finish off with you - I'm finishing off with you. Sliding down"

His flowers, all are gone. Dreams are nothing but illusions. Illusions for one to see. It's the visual projection of our inside. And as empty as the heart in me."

saturnine,"The day you went away. You had to screw me over. I guess you didn't know. all the stuff you left me with. It's weigh too much to handle. But I guess you don't care. You don't need to preach. you don't have to love me, all the time. Whatever on earth possessed you. to make this bold decision. I guess you don't need me. While whispering those words. I cried like a baby. hoping you would care. You don't need to preach. you don't have to love me, all the time. You don't have to preach"
second sunrise,"What is left of our world, today. Walls have fallen with peace. But walls are build within our hearts. Wars are fought within. A cloak lies over our world. A misery show without an end. The masses follow the masses. The blind will lead the way. To see the colors that rest within your mind. The paradise we seek lies inside. Who's to blame, who will lose. Now the dice have been rolled. We must find the guilty ones. Instead of condemning what has been done. Who shall we praise now. When all our gods are gone. Living is not just to live. In a conrete or cardboard box. Think in a carbonized world. Where all has been done before. The thought of a perfect world. On the pile of broken dreams. To see the colors that rest within your mind. The paradise we seek lies behind. Who's to blame, who will lose. Now the dice have been rolled. We must find the guilty ones. Instead of condemning what has been done. From the smoking cities we shall rise. And on the ashes we will build. Praying for that one day"
share the wisdom,"Look at the sky, stars they fall. Peace between worlds, the universal wall. Advanced technologies left on earth. Forward step to a union birth. Circles in the ground, ufo's in the sky. No one ever knows the reason why. Upon horizons rising ships. Inherit what's rightfully theirs. Try to search in space, you lost your track. From this timeless desert, no way back. Feel this as a dream, flying empty massives. Diving skies of blessings, horizon expands. Primitive knowledge erased,. your mind is consuming. Intelligence is an illusion, illusions are created. Look at the sky, stars they fall. Peace between worlds, the universal wall. Advanced technologies left on earth. Forward step to a union birth.

shortest day,He's in a rush run. He has to hurry dash. He's in a rat race. Never at a slow pace. Forever dangerous. And never serious. Up on your energy. Expect no sympathy. Appreciation is overrated. Resting is for fools. He wants his blood boil. Always in turmoil. Blasting his everyway. Throughout the shortest day. Forever dangerous and never serious. Swimming against the stream. And steal all of your dreams. Aggravation is appreciated. He'll use you like a tool. Association is overrated. Friends are for fools. He's in a rush. Fever on his eyes. I do not dare and cross him. He'll smooch you with his lies. Ever so dangerous. He'll haunt you seriously. I wouldn't go within a mile. Radius of him. Aggravation is appreciated. He'll use you like a tool. Association is overrated. Friends are for fools. . (fonte: site oficial)
shot to pieces,What fine judgement I see. in the eyes of our world leaders. Oh how beautiful life could be. if it hadn't been shot to pieces. Shot to pieces. What secret music do I hear. upon the drums of my ear. What great pleasure I feel. I come from nowhere and I shall return. Because of you people I will flee.
shrink,To feel this great urge. to hold and embrace you. I slowly dry out. I shrink and shrink. until I'm gone. nothing to make out of me. oh what the hell went wrong. my heart gets pulled out. into your direction. it's no use. you have forsaken me
"six dead, three to go","Our footsteps in the snow, the blood that marks my hands. Dream of tales that I know as we’re marching to the promised land. From ruins of decayed earth, we came with the rising storm. Monuments of remaining hate in our dark and frozen hearts. Nine elements of light, six have felt our swords. Three get ready for the fight, in battle no place for words. The darkness will shine forever, the winter never ends. Controlling elements of black, the rotting stench is good. Bury the past. Await the new day. The world we lived"
sleepy buildings,Break yourself through the clouds. And build above those sleepy buildings. Mistified by your capabillities. All is yours if you can handle. Visable from higher than the sky. Plane and simple. The facts at your feet. Stones are snoring. Walls are breathing loud. Roofs are poking. Into cosmic mouth. Start the artifact. And build above those sleepy buildings. Only you. Know what is the absolute best. Stones are snoring. Walls are breathing loud. Roofs are poking. Into cosmic mouth
souvenirs,Jump in heat. Plunge to your truth. Agree with your youth. Consider defeat. Part and part. And separate. We will. Brand new paths. In ways to soothe. Never disagree with your youth. Part of your heart. Will separate. It will. The gift of your life. All what was concealed. No skin-deep a dive. Your childhood revealed. You jump in heat. Plunge to your start. Don't underestimate. You're own point of view. Don't part your art. Or hesitate. Your will. The gift of your life. All what was concealed. No skin-deep a dive. Your childhood revealed. You peel all the layers of forever. You start the beginning of the end. Breathing is bridging the gap. Between black and light. And now you feel alive!. And now you learn to dive you know!. Breathing is bridging the gap. Between black and light
stonegarden,And the dreamer sets his sails.... Avoiding all cliffs and stones. But the dreamer is never alone. Always trying to catch the moon. Sailing on the winds of desolation. Horizon's my destination. Through tears I see that. the moon slowly sets. And another attempt has failed.... The waves of the sea drawn to the moon. Like lovers they meet. Carry the light to a distant unknown. Catch it if you can. Always will there be the stars. Always will there be the moon. Always will there be the rocks
strange machines,"It has always been in the back of my mind. Dreaming about going to the corners of time. I always wanted to fly in strange machines. I wanna do centuries in a lifetime. And feel it with my hands. Touch the world war II and Cleopatra. Flying.... Could it be that my dream would come true. Building a machine that would actually do. What I want it to do. Russian revolution, let's do that in one day. Beethoven and Gershwin I think that would be o.k.. More than anything I wanna fly in strange machines. I wanna do centuries in a lifetime. And see it with my eyes. Watch Jesus rise, if he ever did. Flying.... I wanna do centuries in a lifetime. And feel it with my hands. Touch renaissance and Chaka Khan. Flying..."
subzero,"The bowels of my thoughts, icy lake. Drain emotions from my bleeding soul. Tears that follow burn my skin. Dread to see myself, I ain't me. The sun encircles my shape on the ice. In my shadow I see people below. Their frozen faces staring blank. All crying without a sound. Thousand degrees below. Ice age has begun, Subzero. Emotions running low. My heart is so cold, Subzero. Hatred in words, spewing from their mouths. Verbal injection of a freezing void. Sunrise in three directions. As all the faces turn to laugh. Thousand degrees below. Ice age has begun, Subzero. Emotions running low."
the big sleep,"Deprivation of my sleep. is so bad. I need to weep. myself into a coma. And drift far far away. from reality. sing me a lullaby. ""Summertime"". I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. Temporary failure to close my eyes. leeds to a final. loss of sanity. I need to slip. into a deep sunken sleep. And drift far, far away. from reality. I'm dreaming."
the blue vessel,"Its quest around the sun. Mankind on the run. Overwhelming indifference. Destruction fills my eyes. Blue and full of life. Wandering through time. Being outer space. It looks ya right in the face. The Vessel on its way. Saving the grace. Bright gentle face. A life saving case. Propulsion a mistery. Science, the missing link. But damage they cause. By inventing machinery. Inventing my greatest fear. There's so much to discover. Blaming each other tomorrow. Hurting each other today. Fading away. Denying the facts. Turning the Vessel into a wreck. Blowing prospect away. Not trying to save the day. Tomorrow fading away."
the earth is my witness,Mother earth look at her closely. she looks at her baby and she sighs. the slight breathing pause that she takes it builds her and. makes her strong. She refuses to give her up. and we close our eyes. Her hands touch the round stomach. and feel the kick. The eyes that have seen so much cry. with the water she starts to rinse her face. And refuses to give her up. And we close our eyes
the may song,I'm waiting for your hands. to fold around my wrist. I'm mellowing in warm grass. and the scent of you I've missed. And blue is representing. the draft in my heart. I'm wandering through thin skies. and the transparent air I've missed. Pale is my face. you might want to colour. while I breathe. I'm following large drops of rain. with my eyes on the sight of you I've missed. Pale is my face. you might want to colour
the mirror waters,"Slowly... Flying silent. Touching the wind as it sadly sings for me.. Aging on the outside. With my youth in my empty hands. Lost all that I was living for, live no longer. Couldn't resist looking in her eyes. I saw myself, tears were falling. The seas of her eyes reflected my old age. Youth grows old, like winter follows spring. Faster... Falling kingdom. Dancers on winter winds,. they dance... for me. Nature's ways. Life can't always be controlled. Controlled by fear. Scared of months and years, fear no longer. Time leaves it's mark. The years come but never go. Masked is my face. The mask of age will fall, hide no longer. Couldn't resist looking in her eyes. I saw myself, tears were falling. The seas of her eyes reflected my old age"
the sky people,Confidence and hope. I'm looking forward to future plans. Not able to realize yet. Makes me wanna take a rope. or swallow some pills any time. But let's have a look. In the distance I see light. Gives me satisfaction. Keeps me hangin' on. When stability is gone. I take my own life. I make the decisions. I have a goal. That's worth living. Confidence in what I do. realising my hope. That's the bright side I'm looking for. But I know how to take it. In times when my life looks shattered. and I'm not feeling to well. Confused when I think. Which direction not for sure. Dreams far away.
the west pole,As the late evening sun. Slides her way through copper clouds. Golden leaves from autumn. Play over a dusty breeze. I slide my way through the empty park. Weary eyes. Your memory fades. Like dust wake the shades. The still night comes breaking in. Dry raindrops on summer wind. As the late evening sun. Shines her way through aging sky. Closing in on autumn. As I watch the miracle. Of seasons changing. I saw the leaves die. Your memory fades. Like dust wake the shades. The still night comes breaking in. Dry raindrops on summer wind. But I can still see you and I can still hear you. You're spinning around in my head. I can still hear you and I can still see you. Tide is down. I thought I heard the perfect note. I thought I heard you call my name. Your memory fades. Like dust wake the shades. The still night comes breaking in. Dry raindrops on summer wind
these good people,"He worries no more than he. Necessarily needs to fill his void. As big as space never ending thrill. He meets his will by choosing hate. Why choosing?. Need us to smile too?. Alright. Struggling to prevail. Foretaste. The aftermath. Which will be black. As black as waste. We'll throw in an extra dance. For just a little over 5 pence. Need us to smile too?. You'll turn our limo into a hearse. Weighing just enough to run it over your curse. Need us to smile too?. You lie, you lie, you lie. [Anneke van Giersbergen]."
third chance,"Fear and sweat, my muscles ache. I smile, but it's just a fake. I fade away. It troubles me, what you're gonna say. Just a day away. And you will be here to stay. I wait and I wait. And what I really hate. Is the panic that stops me from breathing. My knees hit the floor. And I panic more. Until you open my door. This whole world could explode around us. Will they ever know. we had a third chance?"
travel,"Melodic stanzas. are symphonizing their way. through your weary head. To feed your distrust. And fill it's mouth with the desire. to soulfully be one with your creation. Not a subject to control. you call upon a higer power. for help and inspiration. The crowd waits. and turns their faces. towards you expectantly. you give them what they need. But their useless criticism. makes you die. a bit more inside. Not a subject to control. you call upon a higer power. for help and inspiration. Oh, I swoon. while loudspeakers play soft music. Leaning. over your fourtieth masterpiece. You must have loved. the colour of these violins. I wish I knew you. Your fit of insanity makes me sad. I wish you knew. your music was to stay forever. And I hope..... I have no clue. if you know how much it matters."
treasure,We found our stepping stone. Over darkest hours. We left no trace at home. But saw our footprints ahead. It was our dream stone. Stardust would shine our way. There was a beautiful vision that night. All shades were bright. With hope to catch the sight. Of northern lights. And touch a cooling star. We watched the moonstones. Swim in brightest colours. Reached for horizons. To touch the line that separates earth from sky. Stardust would shine our way. With hope to catch that sight of the northern lights. With hope to catch the sight. Of the northern lights. And touch a cooling star
waking hours,The eyes are made to see. They see the path of our lives. The heart is there to feel. It feels the energy of our time. I can see it. I can feel it. This is my waking hour. This is my place. I can hear it. I feel the power in my heart. And its my moment. It is right there. And its staring me in the face. The sky's in make believe. I see the end of all demise.

we just stopped breathing,Lying - down on. Sidewalk - lying. Running - tears down. His ears - lying. Lying - brought us fear. Where do we go from here?. One day - sixteen. Woke up - sixty. Gasping - hurry. Hurry. Where do we go from here?. (Zlaya Hadzich).

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting. with her cool things and her heaven. hey hey lover, you still burn me. you're a song yeah, hey hey. repeat. Sweet thing I watch you, hey hey"
you learn about it,". Now that we’re through. the hell with you. We don't mind. We just give it a sigh. We hardly knew. what you were capable. of doing. But why don’t you give it a try. Oh, you learn about it. Oh, you harvest (untill you can make no more). All that’s eating inside. All that’s eating inside. We hardly knew. what you were capable. of doing. But why don’t you give it a try. Oh, you learn about it. Oh, you harvest (until you can make no more). All that’s eating inside. All that’s eating inside. Can’t take no more...

you promised me a symphony,"It is 1pm. School bell's ringing. My heart beats fast. I better get on running. She shouldn't be alone. I should have been at home. Your guns, your lies, your cigarettes, your war. She kept us safe. Our hearts were filled with fear. Your prints left messy stains. But who was there to clear?. She shouldn't be alone. I should have been at home. My hope, my faith, your ignorance, your loss"
your troubles are over,Towards the light. I will move on. And so i learn. To move the one. Before the next. Steps i take. Will pave. The road. Ahead of me. I woke this morning. Wondering if i was alive. My head was spinning in circles. Turning to the other side. Apparent broken i hold on to walk. I stumbled over my body. I stumbled over my words. On control upon all wasted. As if i were beyond belief. Apparent broken i hold on to walk. Towards the light [but im afraid]. I will walk [behind the gate]. I will walk [to ride the rain]. Towards the light. I will walk [behind the frame]. I will walk [put up the gate]. Toward the light. Faster than. The speed of mind. Both my arms. Are wrapped around. This new experience. My head in clouds. My feet firmly on the ground. Towards the light. I will walk. I wrapped my arms. Around the ground. Beneath my feet. Towards the light. I will run. I will run. I will run. towards the light. Towards the light. I will move on. And so i learn. To move the one. Before the next. Steps i take. Will pave. The road. Ahead of me. . (fonte: site oficial)
