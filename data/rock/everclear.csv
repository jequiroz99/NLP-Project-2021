I've drifted all over from town to town to town. Every place I go it's always the same. I keep doing junk, I keep going down. My mama got religion and my sisters gave up. Man I just gave up too. I just died inside. Don't wanna die like George. Everybody says there's things to see. Everybody's pointing their fingers at me. I woke up driving. After another blackout from another bad drug. I can't shake this hell that I made for myself. For every other life I took. See my sister's son walk the line I walked. He's only sixteen. If he don't learn from my mistakes. He's gonna waste away.

liquid dreams,"Posters of love surrounding me. I'm lost in a world of fantasy. Every night she comes to me. And gives me all the love I need. Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl. She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine. And she's so fine, designed to blow your mind. She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen. Chorus:. I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child. Just little touch of Madonna's wild style. With Janet Jackson's smile. Throw in a body like Jennifer's. You've got the star of my liquid dreams. My liquid dreams. Angelina Jolie's lips to kiss in the dark. Underneath Cindy C's beauty mark. When it comes to the test, well, Tyra's the best. And Salma Hayek brings the rest. Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl. She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine. And she's so fine, designed to blow your mind. She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen. Chorus. Looks ain't everthing. She's got the sweetest personality. Like Halle B (Halle B). My mama thinks I'm lazy. My friends all think I'm crazy. But in my mind. I leave the world behind. Every night I dream. Liquid dreams. My liquid dreams. Waterfalls and streams. These liquid dreams. Chorus 3x. NOTE: This song is actually by O-Town. Whoever put it here is pretty stupid.."

Is the rain against my window as I pull you near. Don\'t give up on me. Baby, can\'t you you see?. We could make this be the way it used to be. Don\'t give up on me. I wish I could make you see. That I am changing everyday, trying to build a better me. We could make this be the way it\'s supposed to be. Don\'t give up on me. I stand out in the rain where I watched you drive away.

the boys are back in town (lynott),"Guess who just got back today?. Those wild-eyed boys that had been away. Haven't changed, haven't much to say. But man, I still think those cats are great. They were asking if you were around. How you was, where you could be found. I told them you were living downtown. Driving all the old men crazy. . The boys are back in town. . You know the chick that used to dance a lot. Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got. Man when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot. I mean she was steaming. . That night over at Johnny's place. Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face. Man we just fell about the place. If that chick don't want to know, forget her. . Friday night they'll be dressed to kill. Down at Dino's bar and grill. The drink will flow and blood will spill. If the boys want to fight, you'd better let them. . That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song. The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long. It won't be long till summer comes. Now that the boys are here again. . The boys are back in town."

Don't let me need you there. I know damn well you're not alone. Surrounded laughing by the death head grins. Of all my friends who've overdosed. Overdosed and died. And you know. That's the way we go. Back in your color room the shadows fall and break. We would waste away. Burning out, shooting up. I'm not gonna fall with you this time. I might not get up, I'm not strong enough. You know.... Can't you see it's killing me. I'm not gonna walk back into the pit for you. Yeah, not for you or anyone. I don't want the speed, I don't want the heroin. I'm not gonna break. I'm not gonna play your game. When you die alone in that pit of hell. Don't perpetuate the myth, don't romanticize. I'm not gonna watch you die again. I don't want to see. You know.... You don't wanna talk about it but you know. You sit and laugh at me. You'll die laughing. Yeah, you're all fucked up. Can't you see it's killing me.... I'm not gonna walk back into the pit.... For you."
the drama king,"She left him a note on the dining room table. She finally had the last word the day that she went away. She left him a note. She hated confrontation. It was impossible to say to him everything she had to say. I am losing my mind, nothing seems right. I do not know who I am anymore. I am losing the fight. I hate my life. I wish that it was easier to be in love. She cries herself to sleep on the floor of her apartment. She found herself a new place about a half a mile away. She drinks herself to sleep. She gets lost inside the darkness. She is making up for lost time every night and every day. I am losing my mind, nothing seems right. I do not know who I am anymore. I am losing the fight because I hate my life. I wish that it was easier to be in love. You make me want to scream sometimes. No more drama, no more pain. We argue about the same things over and over again. No more drama; I cant take the constant strain. I don't understand why being with you is so goddamned hard. So hard. He found the note when he came home to the empty house. He knew that this was coming the first time he had seen her face. He walked right out the front door in no particular direction. He had to find the reason why these things always end this way. I am losing my mind, nothing seems right. I don't know who I am anymore. I am losing the fight because I hate my life. I wish there was an easier way. to be in love. I am out of my mind, nothing seems right. I don't know who you are anymore. I am losing this fight because I hate my life. And even though I'm leaving. I am still in love with you. I am still in love with you. I am still in love with you. I am still in love with you"
the fire maple song,Turn away from the pain you don't want. Turn it down to avoid them when they call. Strange words I heard. A long long time ago. I wish I could go back to a summertime. I knew more than twenty years ago. Lay between the sheets. We lie underneath the maple tree. Now I can't smile. Lying down in the grass with the wind around us. As we smile and talk. Listen to your grandma sing those country songs. She'd tell us how the maple turns to fire. Every four years. We'd lay in the grass all summer just to watch the autumn come around. I can't smile. Now I can't smile. Now I live alone and you're so far away. I call you every year just around the holiday. I still see you in the night lying above me in the grass. I can't smile. Turn away from the pain you don't want. Turning down to avoid them when they call. I can't believe this letter that says you died. I think I'm gonna go back to the house in North Carolina. Lay in the back yard. Get drunk and let the leaves just bury me. Bury me. I can't smile. Now I can't smile. I don't know what's happened to me. I don't know what's happened to me. I can't smile.

under the western stars,"Paint the stars in the sky. On the ceiling above our bed. Roll through the night with your blood. Beating hard like a drum inside my head. Paint the stars in the sky.

The sex was not enough for you to make you want to stick around. You said that I made you feel weak. I made you feel like you couldn't do anything. I try to sing myself to sleep to the rythym of the sound of the boulevard cars. I lay awake with my eyes wide open underneath the western stars. Hard promises broken that should have never been made. You were cold in your anger. I was warm in the shame. I don't have any illusions of the good old days. If we make it through this then I know that. We can do anything. We can do anything. I'm going to walk all the steps and find a place where I can lie. Lay on my back in the grass and stare at the stars in the warm night sky. I'm going to find me a new blonde girl, hungry for the things that don't come easy in the real world. She will let me be myself. I know she will let me do anything. We can lose ourselves making love all night on a blanket in the neighborhood park. We can lose ourselves making love all night underneath the western stars. We can lose ourselves tonight underneath the western stars. Hard promises broken should have never been made. You were cold in your anger. I was warm in the shame. I don't have any illusions of the good old days. If I can make it through this then I know that I can do anything. I can do anything"

wonderful,"(spoken intro) Wonderful.....Isn't it wonderful now.... I close my eyes when I get too sad. I think thoughts that I know are bad. Close my eyes and I count to ten. Hope it's over when I open them. I want the things that I had before. Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door. I wish I could count to ten. Make everything be wonderful again. Hope my mom and I hope my dad. Can figure out why they get so mad. Hear them scream, I hear them fight. They say bad words and make me want to cry. Close my eyes when I go to bed and I. Dream of angels who make me smile. I feel better when I hear them say. Everything will be wonderful some day. Promises mean everything when you're little and the world's so big. I just don't understand how you can smile with all those tears in your eye. And tell me everything is wonderful now. Na na nana......... Please don't tell me everthing is wonderful now. Go to school and I run and play. I tell the kids that it's all ok. I laugh a lot so my friends wont know. But when the bell rings I just don't want to go home to my room and I close my eyes. I make believe I have a new life. I don't believe you when you say. Everything will be wonderful some day. Promises mean everything when you're little and the world is so big (so big). I just don't understand how you can smile with all those tears. in your eye when you tell me everything is wonderful now. Na na nana......... No. No. I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now. No. No. I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now. I don't to hear you say that I will understand some day.

your arizona room,"Just another night in a bar somewhere. Just another blonde girl. Such a pretty blonde girl. I saw a light behind those cold dark eyes that you show to a cold dark world. Then something came over me. When I touched your face. It took me to a place that I've been afraid to go. Everytime we talk I find another piece of the puzzle of me. That I never really got to know. Sometimes it is so easy to believe that a broken thing can never be whole. Just another night in a hotel room. Just another bad dream. Can you believe? I had another bad dream. We were high on a hill above a big black cloud that turned into a swarm of bees. Then something came over me. Then you held my hand and they faded into summertime when you smiled at me. Every time we talk, I find another piece of the puzzle of me. That I never really got to know. Sometimes it is so easy to believe that a broken heart can never be whole. Give your heart to me, I will give my heart to you. If you believe in me, I'll do anything you want me to do. We can stay in bed until the sun turns into the moon. I will hold you and smile safe in your Arizona room. Inside your Arizona room. There is nothing I'd rather do than be alone with you inside your Arizona room. There is nothing I'd rather do than waste away the day inside your Arizona room. There is nothing I'd rather do. There is nothing I'd rather do than spend the day alone with you. If you give your heart to me, I will give my heart to you. If you believe in me, I'll do anything you want me to do. We can stay in bed until the sun turns into the moon. I will hold you and smile safe in your Arizona room. Inside your arizona room. There is nothing I'd rather do. Inside your arizona room. There is nothing I'd rather do. We can waste away the day. We can waste away the day. Inside your arizona room. There is nothing I'd rather do. There is nothing I'd rather do than spend the day alone with you"
your genius hands,I have seen you shake. and I know what it cost you. I have heard your words now. I am big on your noise. my eyes aren't big enough. because I can't see your hands. I can't see what you hold. I am growing now. as I watch you fade. Now I know what you know and. I'll break the chains that you have made. These chains you've made for me. I will pull you down. I know I'll fail in style. I long to touch your genius hands. .
