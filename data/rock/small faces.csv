show me the way,"I’ve been walking with dawn. For my sleep hath been torn and my happiness gone. There’s an old man in me, who I talk to you see. He’s as old as the sun. Want to know just what I’ve been saying. Please, please, show me the way. All the truth I have known has been scattered and blown. I don’t know who I am. Someone else’s part I am playing. Please, please, show me the way"
something i want to tell you,I’ve got something I want to tell you. I’ve got something I want to say. All the things that you say and do girl. Don’t you know that they’re not my way. I don’t like what you’re running after. It’s not me that you’re thinking of. You forget what we’ve found together. You forget what we’ve found is love. The light in your eyes has faded. And your voice has another tone. I have cried all my tears already. Once again I am all alone. I got something I want to tell you. I got something I want to say
song of a baker,"From 'Ogdens Nut Gone Flake'. There's wheat in the field. And water in the stream. And salt in the mine. And an aching in me.. I can longer stand and wonder. Cos I'm driven by this hunger.. So I'll jug some water, bake some flour,. Store some salt and wait the hour.. When thinking of love,. Love is thinking for me. And the baker will come. And the baker I'll be. I'm depending on my labour,. The texture and the flavour. Hey!. I can no longer stand and wonder. Cos I'm driven by this hunger. So I'll jug some water, bake some flour.. Store some salt and wait the hour."
the autumn stone,"I was nowhere,. Till you changed my mind,. Love is sent through being good to you.. Then you were somewhere,. Somewhere hard to find,. Only what you always were, its true.. I'm looking for an open door,. Where I can sit, and play in peace with you.. Tomorrow changes. Fields of green today,. Yesterday is dead, but not my memory,. We were strangers,. And then you came to stay,. The sweetest spring dawn morning sings to me.. So now I've found a living sound,. That moves, that breathes and then makes love to me."
the hungry intruder,"Here am I. Tiny Fly. May I share your Shepherd's Pie? (English meal, mashed potato & mince. meat). What is this strange voice I hear?. Here I am. Look This Way. In the landscape on your tray. There's no need to ask a silly question. If I were you I hope you'd do the same. There's no doubt I'd help a hungry fly. To see you in a fix it's really such a shame. I'm so hungry. I could die. And now I'll a living fly. My name is Stan. I'm on a quest. Take your fill,. Take nothing less. I am that. That am I. And now I'll be a living fly"
the journey,"If tomorrow was today. It would yesterday. The sun is surely just a thought away. Where visions that men fail. To put to words to tale. And music that they try but cannot (p)lay. You're right it's just a dream, your company so kind. Hold very tightly please and we shall go out."
things are going to get better,"Things are going to get better. Times change, better later than never. Being true to myself. Makes me see all the more. Things are going to get better. Times fly, so don’t you upset her. And I know how I feel. And it’s time for a change. Things are going to get better. I said I knew it, I want to tell everybody. The moment that I met her. And it seems that my mind. Has survived on its own. Things are going to get better"

Tell me what's on your mind. With a little understanding. Everything will be just fine. [Ad lib to end]"
universal,"There's such a lot of good ways to be bad. And so many bad ways to be good, haven't paid my rent yet. I tell them sorry but I haven't got the money anymore.

That's the sea in the trees in the morning. Hello the Universal. Good morning Steve, well you won't believe me today. Working doesn't seem to be the perfect thing for me so I'll continue to play. And if I'm so bad why don't they take me away?. Well a hippy trippy name dropper came through my door. He said: I just bumped into Mick he told me you know where to score?. No not me friend, I mind my own and my own minds me. Well my love is at the foot of your hand come what may. But if June comes first please won't you take me away"
up the wooden hills to bedfordshire,"When you’re slipping into sleep, that’s the time to unwind. Sinking down into the deep, that’s the time of no time. When you’re slipping into sleep. All the sounds around you seem to have a new meaning. Leave your body behind you with a different feeling. When you’re slipping into sleep. The day is night, the night is day. So please out the light as I slip away. Up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire. Up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire. When you’re slipping into sleep, there’s a world you will find.
