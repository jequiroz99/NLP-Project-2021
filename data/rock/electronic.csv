prodigal son,You may be a star in your own mind but you're greatly deluded in my mine I heard reports that you drink and you take drugs most of the time and that your life is in danger And that you were involved in a crime Is it over is it over will you come home now is it over is it over don't you let me down you're the architect of your own excess join the queue At the start of the line In a wilderness with an empty sky the clouds are gone and the dessert is dry the prodigal son is returning he shouldn't be walking the streets they tell me that children are starving He's got everything that he needs is it over is it over will you come home now is it over is it over is it over is it over now Won't you come home now won't you come home now won't you come home now won't you come won't you come home won't you come home now Won't you come home now won't you come home now won't you come won't you come home.
reality,"You keep calling but I'm not at home'. To give me your explanation. I'm not waiting by the telephone. With a feeling of frustration. I always thought that if you understood. You'd clean up this mess and you'd do me some good. I don't need you anymore. I'm not the man you're looking for. Can't you see there's nothing in your head. And your body's on vacation. I keep hearing what I never said. You got me in your conversation. Now it's too late and you get what you see. I don't like this hatred, it just isn't me."
second nature,I used to think that I was lonely. When I was a young boy. Doinâ€™ what they told me. Too many lessons in the school class. Stated my allegiance. Mixing with the wrong class. I lived at home with all my family. Even had my own key. It was given to me. I like to be alone. There was never any friction. Starring in my own film. It was my addiction. *You don't have to wait. The world will carry on. They stare in your face. But it won't stay for long. Blessed be our nation. And sit upon her throne. (But) Don't ever hesitate. Just carry on. (*Repeat). Your older boys were rather surly. Livinâ€™ in the wrong place. Made me grow up early. But it was my home. As I complete my own existence. Staring at my own life. Fading in the distance. Down I stand in time. Smiling faces of the neighbors. Proud of their endeavors. Gonna play forever. Watch tv at home. (*Repeat). **You don't have to wait. The world will carry on. They stare in your face. But it won't stay for long. Blessed be our nation. And sit upon our throne. (But) Don't ever hesitate. Donâ€™t get it wrong. . Don't ever wait. Don't hesitate. Donâ€™t ever wait. Donâ€™t hesitate. (**Repeat 2 times). Don't wait just carry on. Don't wait we'll get along. Blessed be our nation. And sit upon her throne. Don't ever hesitate. Just carry on. Na na na na na na. (Repeat and fade).
second to none,What you need. Love is satisfaction. Is so unreal. I like the feel. But it goes away. It comes too soon. Life is satisfaction. Me and you. We could be in harmony. Love is satisfaction. There is a place. If we must believe. When people go wrong. Our children will see. The color of us. And what we've become. You think we are first. We're second to none. We're second to none. Why does it take. An eternity. Five seconds late. And I could be free. It's what you need (love is satisfaction). Me and you (love is satisfaction). It comes too soon (love is satisfaction). For me and you. There is a place. If we must believe. When people go wrong. Our children will see. The color of us. And what we've become. You think we are first. We're second to none.
some distant memory,"I don't know. If we could get lost. In a city this size. If we wanted to. . And I don't know. If I could survive. Without seeing you. And every time I see your face. I feel out of place. . It's so easy,. Why are you leaving?. Is it just because. I've grown afraid of you?. I wish we were. At the beginning. It would be so good to be with you. . See that girl?. She's over there. I don't need her,. She don't care. I could be one in a million. It would be so good to start again. . It's so easy,. Why are you leaving?. Is it just because. I've grown afraid of you?. I wish we were. At the beginning. It would be so good to be with you"
soviet,"Is it any wonder how the world spins its lonely days for me, like a record with its bruises skips a beat of history. In between the grooves is where I lie, wondering where this lover hides.. To the girl with the marble eyes, can it be that you've taken me by surprise, the wind and rain have carried your fame to my front door in spite of my heart's refrain. Capulet and Montegue, never even heard of me and you. I'll keep this secret of how I adore, this passion girl that I was looking for.. Somehow here we are standing i the rain again, if we could only run away, take this train to better days.. To the girl with the marble eyes, can it be that you've taken me by surprise, the wind and rain have carried your fame to my front door in spite of my heart's refrain. Capulet and Montegue, never even heard of me and you. I'll keep this secret of how I adore, this passion girl that I was looking for.. Can I feel that it's all around, in your eyes there lies this perfect sound.. Uhhmmm . . I digress.."
the patience of a saint,"Talking of my attributes, the things I do so well. As anyone who's in cahoots with me will readily tell. I've lived up here, I've been down there, I've bought so I could sell. And if I drove a faster car, I'd drive it bloody well. How can I change? I live without restraint. And I would try the patience of a saint. Thinking of my attitudes, talking one on one. I may disagree with you, but look where you've come from. And all that you've got, I thought that I would faint. But I would try the patience of a saint. And I would try the patience of a saint. I would try the patience of a saint. I'm talking to myself (to myself). I'm talking to the one that I know best. Bury me with gratitude, you can go to hell. Why should I care? I'd rather watch drying paint. But I would try the patience of a saint. And I would try the patience of a saint. I would try the patience of a saint. And I would try the patience.... ...of a saint."
tighten up,It's never too late I heard you say. How can you turn and go away. I'm staking my claim to some degree. Don't bring the secret home to me. Better to live than to know. Better the noise that we love than hate. Remember the moments we've got. Whenever I feel like I CAN'T ESCAPE.. There used to be a way but there ain't no more. Tell me why because we need it. I used to run away but I can't no more. 'Cause I feel that I can beat it. There used to be a way but there ain't no more. How can we be free? We both need each other like. Sister and brother. You mean that much to me. Better to live than to know. Better the noise that we love than hate. Remember the moments we've left. Whenever I feel I CAN'T ESCAPE.. I'm never gonna do what you want me to. .
time can tell,"You're voice is breaking up. Get off the phone. Come and see me. These times are hard enough. To be alone, I want you with me. And much to my regret. Itâ€™s you i can't forget. Tears on your shoulder. Don't look too far. Surrender me my heart. Then come with me. *Will we still be together. In a year from now. Or do we hate each other. We're gonna get through somehow. Has it turned the world. Into a nightmare. Will it be farewell. Only time can tell. (*Repeat). You'd make the angels wait. And stop the sun if I let you. What good is two. When its reduced by one. How will you value your love. You'd better save your breathe. Give us both a rest until tomorrow. This second you want me. You know I'll come. You are the one."
try all you want,"It's the perfect situation. I'm trying hard to understand. You make my life a celebration. And then you never let me down. If you want to go, I just can't say no. You've got me hanging on a string. I find it hard to turn the other cheek. You know it doesn't mean a thing. I could be through with you within a week. It's the perfect situation. I'm trying hard to understand. Is it still infatuation. Between a woman and a man?. There never was a minute on my own. I never felt I needed anyone. It's the perfect situation. I can't hope to understand."
twisted tenderness,You must think that i'm a fool this twisted tenderness just leaves me cool you've got me in a mess you know it's true out in the wilderness here without you right outside it's a cruel world something happening it's distracting you're just bad news girl. Never let that feeling die all you've got to do is tell a little lie don't you know it's true i will never let you down spread this message all around that i hope and that i pray you can turn my life around. Take a look out there we're under house arrest and you don't care we could always be friends but you were careless right till the end.

until the end of time,"Not a trace of emotion remains inside. Two hearts broken lay down by the riverside. Single handed they tried to escape from me. With a turn of the wheel It was wrong with me. *Drivinâ€™ me crazy, oh baby. You're driving me crazy, oh baby. You're driving me crazy, oh baby. You're driving me crazy, oh baby. **This love was born instead of hate. Celebrate our love (celebrate). Let me feel the right vibration. Celebrate our love (celebrate). And until the end of time. Celebrate what's mine. Make it good and let it shine. Celebrate our love. Revelation. A fate that you can't decide. They lay drown in the flow of the rising tide. There's a side of your life that you never see. It is real this I feel. And drivinâ€™ me-. (*Repeat). ***Gotta find, gotta find, some peace within our time. Until the end of time, until the end of time. (celebrate). Gotta find, gotta find, some peace within our time. Until the end of time, until the end of time. (celebrate). (**Repeat with***). (**Repeat)."
visit me,Early morning with a sigh. She opens both her eyes. Praying for a safe return. Lost in the darkest night. This day the jury has adjourned. Her love has taken flight. *She is coming home. To visit me tonight. She is coming home. To visit me tonight. **Taken from the arms of another. Woken from the deepest dream. Patiently she waits for her lover. Perhaps her life is not what it seemed. Come to me and see my endeavor. Like a leaf she falls to the ground. In the dust that gathers forever. We are spirits making no sound. (*Repeat). (**Repeat 2 Times).
vivid,"My imagination wants to see. The vivid colours of reality. There's a place out there beyond my grasp. A revolution in a looking glass. I've got to get this problem off my chest. I'm sick and tired of being second best. I'll rearrange my credibility. A fundraiser for a restless sea. Don't ever doubt me. What's come over you?. Won't you forgive me?. What are you gonna do?. Don't ever doubt me. What's come over you?. Won't you forgive me?. What are you gonna do?. What will you do?. I can't contain what's inside my head. I'm using words that I must have read. Do you remember the time we spent?. It seems that we were the main event. Have you a reason to behave like this?. Maybe you need a psychoanalyst. If you keep pushing me out of the door, for sure. You'll never see me again. No one to talk to. What am I gonna do?. You're never there. Right when I need you. Give me a cause. Give me a reason. For your applause. I'll commit treason. And in my mind. I know I'm right. It's the same thing every night. You're not to blame. So don't you cry. You don't need me. So hurt my pride. And all the time. I know we tried. Line by line and side by side. And still I pray. That we'll get by. But it don't seem real. And I don't know why. And in my mind. I know I'm right. It's the same thing every night. You're not to blame. So don't you cry. You don't need me. So hurt my pride. And in my mind. I know I'm right. It's the same thing every night. Why do you cry?. You're not to blame. When will you change this sad refrain?. This sad refrain.... Oh, when will you change. This sad refrain?. When will you change this sad refrain?."
warning sign,"Fate just took a wrong turn,. It would appear that we don't agree,. And without warning sign I stopped just in time,. When you ran straight in front of me.. Well I don't listen to the rumours,. And I don't care who you have for tea,. I think you'll find that the thief commits the crime,. At the end of the book you'll see.. You tore me right down,. You've got a hold on me,. I can't believe it's true,. But I believe in me.. It's been so long,. It's been so long.. Don't ever talk to strangers,. You never know what they're gonna say,. And it may be a surprise right in front of your eyes,. They get up, and they walk away.. So the next time you see me listen,. Cos I've got something I want to say,. You've got the wrong attitude and you act like a fool,. And you will pass by within a day.. You tore me right down,. You've got a hold on me,. I can't believe it's true,. But I believe in me.. You tore me right down,. You've got a hold on me,. I can't believe it's true,. It's just the end of time.. You tore me right down,. You've got a hold on me,. I can't believe it's true,. But I believe in me.. You tore me right down,. You've got a hold on me,. I can't believe it's true,. But I believe in me.. It's been so long,. It's been so long.. It's been so long,. It's been so long.."
when she's gone,"I'm shaking like a leaf on a tree do you understand, will you come with me don't make a sound don't even breathe they'll understand why don't we leave We can steal a ride on a bus drive down a road all covered in dust head north by north west till we reach the coast we'll find an address that don't get the post When she's gone even though she won't be long it just tears my world apart puts a hole right through my heart She let me see her new tattoo it was my name written in blue a mark of pain across her chest I was the lover on her breast So come with me and don't be afraid we could be free out of the shade your life has begun come on lets run over the ground in an air raid we've got the gun don't be afraid When she's gone even though she won't be long it just tears my world apart puts a hole right through my heart Only when this girl has gone will I know if I am wrong who would choose a life of one I can't carry on when she's gone.."
