we are,"Echoes of despair. Rride along these. Ripples of air. Subatomic music. Eternally weaved. Into our presence. Those of us that abide. By the laws of harmony. Vibrate at the rate of nature. We are harmony, harmony. The hidden messages they hide. Resonate so deep inside. Apollo's legacy remains. In wordless tounges. Words of silence. Echo through the space. Subatomic music. Eternally weaved. Into our presence. Those of us that abide. By the laws of harmony. Vibrate at the rate of nature. We are harmony, harmony. The lines on your face. Are just the linear code. To a life thats been lived. Through your eyes. And bodies of lead. Were never meant to float. The voiceless rise unified. Through dissonant cries. Echoes resonate unified. From deafening. To nothing. Subatomic music. Eternally weaved. Into our presence. Those of us that abide. By the laws of harmony. Vibrate at the rate of nature. We are harmony, harmony"

weave on,"Weave on. Sisters of the night. On your loom of pain. Try to stitch the darkness through the light. Weave on proverty and crime. The wars and waste. Gives our souls a break from the hunger. For the prophets and the saints. Stitch it on. The weapons drawn. And the children's splayed. And the fathers found. In unmarked graves. With your fingers pale and numb. Just braid. Oh you sisters weave on. Let the blood run through your thread. Oh you sisters weave on. With your stitching. Purple, blue and red. Oh you sisters weave on. Let the blood run through your thread. Just you still weave on. Feed on, sorry sons of state. Preaching salvation. While we fall. With such amazing grace. Feed on love of money. Love of race. Disrespect of country. And of neighbor's. Neighbored in our hate. Stitch it on. The brothers gone. And the lives they gave. To their foreign graves. With your fingers pale and numb. Just braid, just braid. Oh you sisters weave on. Let the blood run through your thread. Oh you sisters weave on. Weave your stitching. Purple, blue and red. Just you sisters weave on. Let the blood run through your thread. All you sisters weave on. These are the plans. The words we hear from mind deranged. You there who share his pain. Withdraw from this place and speedily. Lest the harsh, spite your mind also with madness. How dare, you urge us to cowardice. I'm ready to endure. With him whatever must be. I am ready to endure. With him whatever must be. Oh you sisters weave on. Let the blood run through your thread.
