only women bleed,Man's got his woman to take his seed. He's got the power - oh. She's got the need. She spends her life through pleasing up her man. She feeds him dinner or anything she can. She cries alone at night too often. He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Man makes your hair gray. He's your life's mistake. All you're really lookin' for is an even break. He lies right at you. You know you hate this game. He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain. She cries alone at night too often. He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Black eyes all of the time. Don't spend a dime. Clean up this grime. And you there down on your knees begging me please come. Watch me bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed. Only women bleed.

pick up the bones,Collecting pieces of my family. In an old pillow case. This one has a skull. But it don't have a face. These look like the arms of father so strong. And the ring on this finger. Means my Grandmother's gone. Here's some legs in a pile. Where my sister once played. Here's some mud made of blood. And these teeth are decayed. The ear of my brother. The hand of a friend. And I just can't. Put them back together again. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. There are stains on the floor. Where the kitchen once stood. There are ribs in the fireplace. Mixed with the wood. There are forces in the air. Ghosts in the wind. Some bullets in the back. And some scars on the skin. There were demons with guns. Who marched through this place. Killing everything that breathed. They're an inhuman race. There are holes in the walls. Bloody hair on the bricks. And the smell of this hell. Is making me sick. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. Now maybe someday. The suns gonna shine. Flowers will bloom. And all will be fine. But nothing will grow. On this burnt cursed ground. Cuz the breath of the death. Is the only sound.

brutal planet,"We're spinning round on this ball of hate. There's no parole, there's no great escape. We're sentenced here until the end of days. And then my brother there's a price to pay. We're only human, we were born to die. Without the benefit of reason why. We live for pleasure - to be satisfied. And now it's over there's no place to hide. Why don't you, come down to. It's such a brutal planet. It's such an ugly world. Why won't you, come down to. ""This world is such perfection"" (What a sight). ""It's just like paradise"" (For my eyes). ""A truly grand creation"" (What a sight). ""From up here it looks so nice"" (For my eyes). It's such a brutal planet. It's such a living hell. It was a holy garden. That's right where Adam fell. It's where the bite was taken. It's where we chose to sin. It's where we first were naked. This is where our death begins. We took advice from that deceiving snake. He said don't worry it's a piece of cake. And sent us swimming in a burning lake. Now we're abandoned here for heaven's sake. Why don't you, come down to. It's such a brutal planet. It's such an ugly world. Why won't you, come down to. ""This world is such perfection"" (What a sight). ""It's just like paradise"" (For my eyes). ""A truly grand creation"" (What a sight). ""From up here it looks so nice"" (For my eyes). Here's where we keep the armies. Here's where we write their names. Here's where the money god is. Here's our famous hall of shame. Here's where we starve the hungry. Here's where we cheat the poor. Here's where we beat the children. Here is where we pay the whore. Why don't you, come down to. It's such a brutal planet. It's such an ugly world. Why won't you, come down to. ""This world is such perfection"" (What a sight). ""It's just like paradise"" (For my eyes). ""A truly grand creation"" (What a sight). ""From up here it looks so nice"" (For my eyes). Right here we stoned the prophets. Built idols out of mud. Right here we fed the lions. Christian flesh and Christian blood. Down here is where we hung ya. Upon an ugly cross. Over there we filled the ovens. Right here the holocaust."

die for you,"A hundred numbers on my wall. Some with names I sometimes call. I drop a coin and watch it fall. Tryin' to get connected to you. A thousand hours all alone.

I'm like a broken toy forgotten on the shelf. Baby, I could have been someone. I could have been something. It would have been nothing to die for you. Baby, you're going to need me. You'd better believe me It would have been easy to die for you. A million memories flood my brain. Drown my sorrow. Kill my pain. Whets my thirst for you again. Just another night to get through. All my neighbors scream for quiet at my door. Shattered glass and torn up photos on the floor. Well, I couldn't stand to see your pictures anymore. Baby, I could have been someone. I could have been something. It would have been nothing to die for you. Baby, you're going to need me. You'd better believe me It would have been easy to die for you. These cuts are deep but you plead innocent. Are you hell or are you heaven-sent. You're much to cold to know how much. You meant to me, yeah. A billion tear drops fallen from my eyes. But it's just a joke now. And I'm laughing at your lies. You make me hard as rock and now I realize. Baby, I could have been someone. I could have been something. It would have been nothing to die for you. Baby, you're going to need me. You'd better believe me It would have been easy to die for you."

Former Lee Warmer pulls up the covers to hide in his wrinkled bed. No dreams go in, no dreams go out of the hole in his wrinkled head. Former Lee Warmer. When I hear him play in his twisted key. That's the way he calls to me. On a silver tray, I keep the master key. In every way, he depends on me. Former Lee Warmer, an old smoking jacket - holes in his satin sleeves. Candle lit puddles, arthritic fingers, yellow stained ivory keys. In an upstairs room under lock and key. It's my brother, Former Lee. And after all these years, I've never heard him speak. I wonder what he thinks of me. Former Lee Warmer peeks out the window. When he feels really brave. Former Lee Warmer waves at his father. Out in the family grave. He's flesh and blood to me. I love him brotherly. But, I don't want to be Former Lee."

freedom,"We the people of the United States. In order to form a more perfect union. Stop pretending that you've never been bad. You're never wrong and you've never been dirty. You're such a saint, that ain't the way we see you. You want to rule us with an iron hand. You change the lyrics and become Big Brother. This ain't Russia, you ain't my Dad or Mother.

Freedom, raise your fist and yell. Freedom to rock, freedom to talk. Freedom-ring. You're playing God from your ivory tower. Back off preacher, I don't care if it's Sunday. I ain't no angel, but I never felt better. We're a make-up metal degeneration. We're not as stupid as you want to make us. You better leave us man. 'Cuz you sure can't take us. Nobody better tell you how to live your life. You gotta do it on your own. Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell. Freedom to rock, freedom to talk. Freedom, raise your fist and yell. Freedom to rock, freedom to talk. Freedom-ring. Cuz I never walk away from what I know is right. But I'm gonna turn my back on you. Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell.

fresh blood,"All the neighbours never see me. But they wonder why I walk around at night. He gets hungry - I go hunting. In the moonlit streets. For somebody that's right. Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast Is all he's living for. And he craves it more and more. Showgirls, businessmen in suits in the midnight rain. If they walk alone are never seen again. In the paper, seems a florist. Found in Lincoln Park, died of some anemia. No one raped her, poor Doloris. Just detained her and drained her on the spot. Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast. Is all he's living for. And he craves it more and more. Old men, ladies of the night walking in the rain. If they walk alone are never seen again. Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me. Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me. Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me. Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me. No one calls and no one visits. We're like a couplet out of Desolation Row. We don't want them to want to know us. 'Cause when they do, they get a little bit too close. Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast is all I'm living for. And I crave it more and more. Bad girls, cops on the beat in the midnight rain. If they're out alone, are never seen again. Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me. Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me. Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me. Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me. Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me. Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me. Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me. Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me. Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me. Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me, cry to me.

from the inside,I got lost on the road somewhere. Was it Texas or was it Canada. Drinking whiskey in the morning light. I work the stage all night long. At first we laughed about it. My long-haired drunken friends. Proposed a toast to Jimmy's ghost. I never dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end. I'm stuck here on the inside looking out. I'm just another case. Where's my makeup where's my face on the inside. All got your kicks from what you saw up there. Eight bucks even buys a folding chair. I was downing seagrams on another flight. And I worked that stage all night long. You were screaming for the villain up there. And I was much obliged. The old road sure screwed me good this time. It's hard to see where the vicious circle ends. I'm stuck here on the inside looking out. That's no big disgrace. Where's my makeup where's my face on the inside.
gail,A tree has grown on the spot. Where her body did rest. Blood seeped into the soil. From the knife in her chest. The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail. I wonder how the bugs remember Gail. What a lovely young girl. Everybody would say. You can still hear her laugh. In the shadows on a cold winter's day. A dog dug up a bone and wagged it's tail. I wonder how the dog remembers Gail. The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail. I wonder how the bugs remember Gail.

I need a preacher breathing fire. To burn away my sins. And I can't help the victims. On the side of the road. And I can't stop the cyclone. That's about to explode. Thunder lightning. The wind outside is so damn frightening. But it's alright, all right. Stand clear. You're living in the hurricane years. In the hurricane years. Turn my eyes to heaven.

The taste can leave cold. You know I hate it. But I cannot refuse to capture control. How it seems. There's no way out. I guess I never knew. Emptiness has left no doubt. Now I want you. Baby I miss you. When are you coming home. No matter where you are. I hate being alone. Baby I miss you. When are you coming home. No matter where you are. I hate being alone. Baby I miss you.

i'll bite your face off,"She was a dirty dream, cool and clean. With seduction dancing in her eyes. She turned around, looked me up and down. She took me by surprise. I tried to run, tried to hide. But my feet were made of clay. Looked in her eyes, I was paralyzed. I just couldn't get away. She licked her lips, they were bloody red. She had the heart of the living dead. She pushed me down on a burning bed. Thought I was in heaven, but instead. She turned her head and she softly said. I'll bite your face off. I'll bite your face off. I'll bite your face off -- little man. I'll bite your face off -- you know that I can. She put the whip into cream. She was a sinner's queen, oh a delicious angel face. She'd invite you in, c'mon and lick my skin. You'd sell your soul for another taste. She took my heart, my resistance fled. I loved each lie that I was fed. She pushed me down on a burning bed. Thought I was in heaven, but instead. She turned her head and she softly said. I'll bite your face off. I'll bite your face off. I'll bite your face off -- little man. I'll bite your face off -- you know that I can. She pushed me down on a burning bed. Thought I was in heaven, but instead. She turned her head and she softly said. I'll bite your face off.

i'll still be there,"I lay in bed and in my head. There's work that must be done. There are flies to kill and blood to spill. And webs that must be spun. Change your face, your name, your number. Cut your hair. Bolt your doors and lock your windows. I'll find you there. Can't eat, can't sleep. This city creeps with sacrificial sheep. Well I thought of grace for mercy's sake. But that will go away. Change your face, your name, your number. Dye your hair. Bolt your doors and lock your windows. I'll find you there. Hold your breath, I still can hear you. Anywhere. Fake your death, I?m always near you. I'll be there. Somewhere in there, my clouded brain. A voice says I'm insane. Disguise your eyes. No, you can't hide. Shake up your make-up. Or you'll never wake up. You may not wake up (you can't hide). You'll never wake up (you can't hide). You'll never wake up (I'll always be there).

i'm alive,"I was just kicking down the street. And the sun was in my eyes. So I couldn't see the truck. That was sixty times my size. And just seconds off from splattering me. Let me tell you. I was so scared I couldn't move. Like my boots were full of glue. Then I felt a little tug. And I thought of good Old Blue. And he pulled me from that catastrophe. That was the day. My dead pet returned to save my life. I'm alive. He's alive. I'm alive. I was spitting in the canyon. Near the cliff up on the mountain. When an unexpected sneeze. Hung me in the breeze. At forty five degrees in the sky. Suddenly I felt something. Had me by the belt. And in between my praying. Swore I heard a stallion neighing. Was the ghost of my horse. And I cried, yes I cried. That was the day. My dead pet returned to save my life. That was the day. My dead pet returned to save my life. I'm alive. He's alive. Hey, I'm alive. Things were getting gory. Got caught on territory. Belonging to the Crutches. In an alley in their clutches. Looking kind of dismal that night. Well the leader's name was Fats. Swinging broken baseball bats. Things got really frantic. Starting jumping in their panic. That was the day. My dead pet returned to save my life. That was the day. My dead pet returned to save my life. I'm alive, I'm alive, real alive. That was the day my dead pet returned. That was the day my dead pet returned. That was the day my dead pet returned. That was the day my dead pet returned. To save my life. Hallucinating billions of rats. Lots of rats. I'm alive, I'm alive. He's alive, he's alive, he's alive. I'm alive, yeah. He's alive, he's alive. I'm alive, real alive.

i'm always chasing rainbows,"At the end of the rainbow, there's happiness. And to find it how often I've tried. But my life is a race just a wild goose chase. And all my dreams have been denied. Why have I always been a failure. What can the reason be. I wonder if the world's to blame. I wonder if it could be me. I'm always chasing rainbows, watching clouds drifting by. My schemes are just like all my dreams. Ending in the sky. Some fellows look and find the sunshine. I always look and find the rain. And some fellows make a winning sometime. And I never even make a gain. I'm always chasing rainbows waiting to find the little bluebird in vain.."

inmates (we're all crazy),"It's not like we did something wrong. We just burned down the church. While the choir within sang religious songs. And it's not like we thought we was right.

levity ball,I got my invitation to the annual levity ball. Seeing the location is within the mirrored room. Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find. I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind. I sat down on the stairway seven hours at a time. Writing all of this poetry that I knewq would never rhyme. The memory I knew I must have had when I came in. Was of some varied places where I've never ever been. And then in came a cake all decorated in my name. With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name. The clock was passing out from time to time I saw it all. The beginning of the ending of my first levity ball
life and death of the party,"You walk into the room, everybody stares. The talking stops, there's a silence there. The room is yours, you own it now. You're in control and everybody down here knows.

You're the life and the death of the party. You got my heart right by the throat. You're the life and the death of the party. When the stage lights rise. You start and stop the show.

When the stage lights rise. You start and stop the show."
little by little,"Black leather gloves and your lipstick shines. Bright as moonlight glows. My wildest rose cuts so fine and deep. It hurts but never shows. You're bad, you're so hardcore. Pull me down here on the killing floor. Little by little we cross the line. Little by little the ties that bind. Little by little by little by little. Little by little tonight. Your sugar tongue speaks hot and sweet. Lying just for fun. Push and shove. Sex is sex But honey, love is love. We're not sick insane. Just another lovers' game. Little by little we cross the line. Little by little the ties that bind. Little by little by little by little. Little by little tonight. I'm all undone. My pretty one. Don't slap my face. Unless you kiss me.

living,Living is only one part of being. Believing is to know just what you're feeling. You and some positive think you know you had. I'm sure you knowing you're growing and it's you. Thinking is you're own world of living. Dreaming is the one way to feeling. Your mind and your eye can see everything that you. The only real person you need to know is you.

long way to go,We still got a long way to go. We still got a long way to go. We all got a long way to go. What's keeping us apart isn't selfishness. What's holding us together isn't love. Listen to the man who's been. Touched all his life. Yes he's the one they call the fool. Where is the saviour of the sidewalk life. And the road that takes us to the crusades. I've seen the shadows. As they're moving in my sleep. Leading the blind poet to his grave. We still got a long way to go. We still got a long way to go. Yes we all got a long way to go. Please don't waste your energy on me my friend. Cause we still got a long way to go. We'll meet again some day. But right now just go away. Cause I still got a long way to go. The silence is speaking. So why am I weeping. I guess I love it. I love it to death. We still got a long way to go. Yes we still got a long way to go. Yes we all got a long way to go.

love should never feel like this,"Somebody told me love`s a beautiful thing. And when I found it all the bells would just ring. The sun would shine and all the birds would sing. Then I met you. I searched the planet for that magical girl. I walked a million miles all over the world. I found the oysters, but never the pearls.. Then I met you.... I can`t eat. I can`t sleep. I feel sick. I`m so weak. Love should never feel like this. I must be doing something wrong. I`ve never felt this way before. Walk in the bathroom and I take a deep breath.

love's a loaded gun,"Somebody saw you at the station. You had your suitcase in your hand. You didn't give no information. You walked off with another man. I'm always standing in the shadows, baby. I watched you give yourself away. You take them home into your bedroom. You had another busy day. I tried to look the other way and fake it. You push me to the limits. I can't take it. One down, one to go. Just another bullet in the chamber. Sometimes love's a loaded gun. Red lights, stop and go. Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger. Sometimes love's a loaded gun. And it shoots to kill. Someday they'll put me in a squad car. Someday they'll throw away the key. But 'til that day I'll be a mad dog. Cuz that's what you taught me to be.

lullaby,"I was the boy who said all of my prayers. Laid my clean face on the pillow. Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure. Through the night. I heard a noise, it was probably nothing. It pulled me right out of a dream. If I knew it was you. I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream. I am the one who growls in your closet. I am the one who lives under your bed. Get down - back where you started. Get down - back into hell. Your black soul, you know you're. Black hearted. I smell your sulfurous smell. All of my things that I play with in daylight. You turn into monsters at night. My toys were my friends. Until you taught them all how to bite. You showed me things little boys. Shouldn't see. You scared me with visions of fire. You danced on my bed. With the flames on your head dancing higher. I am the one who growls in your closet. I am the one who lives under your bed. Get down - back where you started. Get down - back into hell. Your black soul, you know you're. Black hearted. I smell your sulfurous smell. I tell ya right now. I don't want your reptile embrace. I don't want to follow you down. To your place. I don't want to be a child of disgrace. You can take your whiskey soaked, foaming. at the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup. spewing, sweating blood demon breath out. of my face. Get down - back where you started. Get down - back into hell. Your black soul, you know you're. Black hearted. I smell your sulfurous smell. I was the boy who said all of my prayers. Laid my clean face on the pillow. Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure. Through the night."
luney tune,"I slipped into my jeans. Lookin hard and feelin mean. I took a spit at the moon. It's all in this luney tune. Just a little insane. A couple shots, I can't feel no pain. Hey, where have I been?. And who are these scary men?. Is this all real?. Is this all necessary?. Or it this a joke?. Many know I don't regret at all. They locked me up for good. Pinned me against the wall. I can't find the exit. I quit lookin for doors. I stole a razor from the commissary. I just couldn't take it no more. I'm swimmin in blood. Like a rat on a sewer floor. No longer insane. Just part of this crazy dream."
make that money (scrooge's song),"When I was a boy. I never played with toys. Never had a friend. Never laughed or cried much. And when I was a boy. My father was a man. With a strict and sturdy hand. No soft touch. Make that money, make that money. Make that money run like honey. On your tongue. Gotta make that money. Make that money, listen sonny. Learn to sting before your stung. Now that I'm a man. Every penny has been planned. I'm financially grand. And perfectly greedy. Sentimental fools. I make all your rules. I've got your cash, got your jewels. They're all mortgaged to me. Make that money, make that money. Make that money run like honey. On your tongue. Gotta make that money. Make that money, listen sonny. Learn to sting before your stung. And I know. 'Cause he told me so. Told me so I believe him. I still believe.... Give me that money. Controlling all your cash. I could make you live in trash. I eat pheasant, you eat hash. No philanthropy. But when it's time for me to croak. Bury me with all my dough. And where there should've been an oak. My private money tree will grow. Make that money. Said make that money. Make that money run like honey. On your tongue. Told me so. Told me so. He told me so."

my god,"If I should find myself in blackest night,. And fear is stabbin' me all over,. A tiny prayer cracks the dark with light,. And I here sounds behind my wall.. Inside, a still small voice, it calls and calls.. Then like a thunder bolt it falls and falls:. My God!. When life becomes more real than children's games,. Or we've become too old to play them,. We'll grow old gracefully,. We'll hide our shame. but there's that voice behind the wall.. And like my conscience, it is still and small.. Each word is mercy, protects us all:. My God!. ""Et in lux perpetuo"". ""Deu domine"". ""Et in pax aeternus"". ""Deu domine"". I was a boy, when tempted, fell sometimes,. And fell so low, no one could see me,. Save for the eyes of Him that sees my crime.. When sheep, like me, have drifted lost,. All frightened children who are tempest tossed,. Down flies His wrath like an albatross:. My God!."

She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality. She said ""Come and lay down on the floor with me. It's warmer here by the fire"". She didn't know that there was more of me. She'd have to learn to love all four of me. 'Cause I'm in no man's land. I'm lookin' for the real me. If only I could feel me. You know I'm in no man's land. Sometimes I gotta play me.

nurse rozetta,I'm a shepherd for the pentecost. I got my scriptures and my wires crossed. I got no kids and I got no home. They want us holy men to live alone. Since I've been here for a little stay. I see Rozetta day by day. She turns my head makes me cough. I want to tear my collar off. I just can't sleep at night. Rozetta dressed in white. She's got the Devil's light. Shining in her eyes. Screamed my sermon damning sin and vice. When underneath I was a regular guy. My pulpit melted like a block of ice. When a bolt of lightning hit me from the sky. From my stretcher when they wheeled me in. I stared directly in the eyes of sin. Nurse Rozetta standing over me. And I was helpless as a man of God could be. Nurse Rozetta I won't let her. Catch me peering down her sweater. Fantasizing silk suspenders on her thighs. Nurse Rozetta make me better. Secretly my eyes undress her. Let me feel your tongue depressor. I'm suddenly twice my size. My pants are all wet inside. She's so creative with a bar of soap. And so inventive with a stethoscope. To check my pulse she gotta hold my hand. I blow the fuse on the encephalogram. Satan sent her from the bowels of hell. I should have recognized old Jezbel. I surrendered to the urges felt. She popped the buckle on my bible belt. I just can't sleep at night. Rozetta dressed in white. She's got the Devil's light. Shining in her eyes. I'd lick her nylon seams. Like a hungry cat with cream. Oh what a vivid scene. And I can't hold back no more.

pick up the bones,Collecting pieces of my family. In an old pillow case. This one has a skull. But it don't have a face. These look like the arms of father so strong. And the ring on this finger. Means my Grandmother's gone. Here's some legs in a pile. Where my sister once played. Here's some mud made of blood. And these teeth are decayed. The ear of my brother. The hand of a friend. And I just can't. Put them back together again. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. There are stains on the floor. Where the kitchen once stood. There are ribs in the fireplace. Mixed with the wood. There are forces in the air. Ghosts in the wind. Some bullets in the back. And some scars on the skin. There were demons with guns. Who marched through this place. Killing everything that breathed. They're an inhuman race. There are holes in the walls. Bloody hair on the bricks. And the smell of this hell. Is making me sick. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. Pick up the bones. And set them on fire. Follow the smoke going higher and higher. Pick up the bones. And wish them goodnight. Pray them a prayer and turn out the light. Now maybe someday. The suns gonna shine. Flowers will bloom. And all will be fine. But nothing will grow. On this burnt cursed ground. Cuz the breath of the death. Is the only sound.

the quiet room,The California air. Your nightgown on the stairs. I remember every night. Scenes from home in the Quiet Room. How long have I been gone. Did winter kill the lawn. And all those polaroids you sent. Are on the wall in the Quiet Room. They've got this place. Where they've been keeping me. Where I can't hurt myself. I can't get my wrists to bleed. Just don't know why. Suicide appeals to me. The Quiet Room. Is sterilized and white. It's like a tomb. With just a moth stained naked night. Plastic forks and spoon. No laces in my shoes. They all know what I tried to do. Outside the Quiet Room. This quiet place. It ain't so new to me. It's haunted atmosphere. Has heard so many scream. My home from home. My twilight zone. My strangest dream. My confidant. I have confessed my life. The Quiet Room. Knows more about me than my wife. They've got this place. Where they've been keeping me. Where I can't hurt myself. I just can't I just can't get these damn wrists to bleed. A mattress on the floor. No handles on the door. I really need nothing here. I'm alone.

the song that didn't rhyme,"Wrote a song, it was wrong from it`s very first conception. Seemed I struggled on every line. It wasn`t fast, wasn`t pretty, wasn`t serious or witty. The song that didn`t rhyme. The band couldn`t wing it, the singer couldn`t sing it. The Drummer's always out of time. The DJ`s were offended, my union card suspended. Billboard declared it a crime. The melody blows in a key that no one can find. The lyrics don`t flow but I can`t get it out of my mind. A three minute waste of your time. On a song that didn`t rhyme. It was bland, it was boring, all the groupies there were snoring. The first time we played it live. All the record guys got fired, the president retired. But somehow the song survived. The melody blows in a key that no one can find. The lyrics don`t flow but I can`t get it out of my mind. The melody blows in a key that no one can find. The lyrics don`t flow but I can`t get it out of my mind. A three minute waste of your time. No redeeming value of any kind. But thanks for the twelve ninety nine. On a song that didn`t rhyme."

zombie dance,"Walkin' through the tombstones. Go there everyday. Stood damn still I got a chill. Someone walked across my grave. Stroll across the killing fields. In the middle of the night.

Sneak up on the bonfire. Watch the zombies dance. My tongue is hot and burnin'. When I try to speak. Spirit is so willing. My flesh is gettin' weak. Yeah, it's gettin' weak. Now I ain't superstitious. Don't roll no juju bones. Someone calls in the middle of the night. And no one's on the phone. Black cat crossed my pathway. Winks her juju eye.

zorro's ascent,"Zorro lies dying. In the Spanish sun. All the women crying,. Especially the pretty ones. He drew his sword.... They came with guns. Stealing is stealing,. I've done lots of that.

You need not bother. 'Cause I am the fox. And I go where I want. If heaven ignores me. The devil adores me. Yes, I am the fox. And I go where I want. Padre, don't it seem. Hundred years ago. Before I donned the mask. I'm Don Diego. Now there's only minutes left. For the cunning El Zorro. Go fetch my sword... my horse. I'll ride out death Diablo. So pray for him father,. You need not bother. 'Cause I am the fox. And I go where I want. If heaven ignores me. The devil adores me. I am the fox. And I go where I want. Death you're running closer. And I can't keep this pace. Sir, I'm disadvantaged. And should I lose this race. Hand to me your deadliest wine. I'll give you back a taste. Before you burn your mark on me. I'll carve mine in your face. So pray for him, father. You need not bother. 'Cause I am the fox. And I go where I want. When Satan annoys me. Then heaven employs me. 'Cause I am the fox. And I go where I want to go. El Zorro."
