Some of them here, the same as you and I. The differences are all but left behind. So I need you now. Rescue me. In the middle of the ocean. Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe. Some say ""it's hard to make the changes"". Rescue me and I'll never be the same. Rescue me. In the middle of my darkest hour. Time will tell. I never really had the power. Some say ""it's easier to give up on it"". I say ""it's time to rescue me"". We gotta get out. How foolish have we been. To say it's all been a waste of time?. We may lose, and we may win. But like the sun we will rise again. But until then. Rescue me. In the middle of the ocean. Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe. Some say ""it's hard to make the changes"". Rescue me and I'll never be the same. Rescue me. In the middle of my darkest hour. Time will tell. I never really had the power. Some say ""it's easier to give up on it"".

life after you,"Ten miles from town and I just broke down. Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road. I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home. To tell you I was wrong but you already know.

I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after. After the life we've been through. 'Cause I know there's no life after you. Last time we talked, the night that I walked.

long live rock and roll,"Well I was born. The year that disco died. And U2 was in high school. Thank the Lord that they survived. Got my first taste, on a seger 45. And since that Kiss. I've rocked all day, and partied every night. And we still argue 'bout who's better. Elton John or Billy Joel. And we still wonder. If Kurt really wrote the song. She sang in Hole. No, we'll never stop believing. It's the journey of our lives. So won't you help me pour some sugar. On these memories tonight?. Singin'. Long live Rock, long live Roll. Long live big guitars and music for the soul. Sayin'. Don't give up, don't grow old. Long live crazy nights and records made of gold. Long live rock and roll. Summer of 96, I got my first guitar. And played it 'til my fingers said. ""You're gonna be a star"". Grunge was everything, at least, it was to me. A Marshall in my Chevy Sprint. Just running down a dream. We still argue 'bout who's better. Mötley Crüe or GnR. And we still can't believe Van Helen. Turned into Van Hagar. Now the record shops are gone for good. And no one seems to care. But me and you, and all our friends. Keep living on that prayer. Singin'. Long live Rock, long live Roll. Long live big guitars and music for the soul. Sayin'. Don't give up, don't grow old. Long live crazy nights and records made of gold. Long live rock and roll. Went to bed in Cleveland. Woke up in Tenessee. No matter where I roam tonight. I'm chasing history. We still argue 'bout who's better. The Beatles or the Stones. They're forever 27. Jimi, Janis, Brian Jones. And we stand here in their memory. 'Cause the songs, they still survive. So throw your lighters up. And darling sing with me tonight. Come on. Long live Rock, long live Roll. Long live big guitars and music for the soul. Sayin'. Don't give up, don't grow old. Long live crazy nights and records made of gold. Long live rock and roll. Long live Rock, long live Roll. Long live big guitars and music for the soul. Sayin'. Don't give up, don't grow old.

But the thought of staring back at you. Is more than I can face. And its a long way now. Where I used to rest my head. And Its safe and sound. If only I could turn around. Theres no direction where I stand. Just dead end signs and wasted land. And its a long way now to you. Trusted hope. She left me standing by. To find what's lost. Is it in her eyes. Pulling me back to the place. Just thinking of myself without you. Is more than I can take. And its a long way now. Where I used to rest my head. And Its safe and sound. If only I could turn around.

louder than ever,"Heard that song on the radio,. And it got my gears turnin'. Like a real life time machine.. You were there in the front seat,. Windows down we were burning,. It was just like a movie scene,. Those dashboard lights,. And your pale blue eyes cutting through me.. Two hearts on the getaway,. Feels just like yesterday,. Young love on the freeway,. Singing louder than ever.. Those nights we used to sing along,. We were living a love song,. Those days might be gone,. But I hear it louder than ever.. We spent that whole summer long,. You and me and the moonlight,. Chasing dreams in a fast machine,. No way it could go wrong,. When it all felt so right,. Feeling like california queen,. I cannot get all of the ways that you loved me.. Two hearts on the getaway,. Feels just like yesterday,. Young love on the freeway,. Singing louder than ever.. Those nights we used to sing along,. We were living a love song,. Those days might be gone,. But I hear it louder than ever.. I can't help but turn it up,. No it can't get loud enough,. Yeah, I just wanna' hear it,. Over and over,. Over and over,. Heard that song on the radio,. And it got my gears turnin'. Like a real life time machine.. Two hearts on the getaway,. Feels just like yesterday,. Young love on the freeway,. Singing louder than ever.. Those nights we used to sing along,. We were living a love song,. Those days might be gone,. But I hear it louder than ever.. Two hearts on the getaway,. Feels just like yesterday,. Young love on the freeway,. Singing louder than ever.. Those nights we used to sing along,. We were living a love song,. Those days might be gone,.

lullaby,"I can't wait to see your faces. I can't wait to hold your hands. I can't wait to take you places. And watch you try to understand. But until I do. Yeah, until I do. I'll be right here waiting for you. I can't wait to see your faces. And I can't wait to hold your hands. When you get here, it's off to the races. And we'll tackle all life's demands. But until I do. Yeah, until I do. I'll be right here singing for you. Soon I will see your faces. And I'll get to hold your hands. I know I'll have trouble trying to explain. The things I don't understand. And until I do. Since I won't have a clue. I'll just sing this song for you. Yeah, until I do. And this is you-know-who. And daddy's right here singing for you"
maybe we're already gone,"Our time's just another let down. White lies tearin' up a small town. Lost cause, someone's gotta break through. Coin toss, give away your next move. So much talkin', left with walkin'. Is this really what we wanted?. I don't think we'll ever know. Know you're sayin' hell we're payin'. Everything we want is fadin'. Faster than you'll ever know. Can you see the signs?. Have we lost our minds?. Looks like we've fallen. Feels like we've fallen. Down and down we go. Never felt so low. Can't hear you callin'. So maybe we're already gone. Maybe we're already gone!. Caught up, temporary meltdown. So what, it doesn't matter right now. Right now, anyhow. After somethin', all or nothin'. Goes right by ya, sends no motion. Why we let it take control?. Know you're sayin' hell we're payin'. Everything we want is fading. And all is lost and heaven knows. Can you see the signs?. Have we lost our minds?. Looks like we've fallen. Feels like we've fallen. Down and down we go. Never felt so low. Can't hear you callin'. So maybe we're already gone. Maybe we're already gone!. We'll make it through. Yeah, there's nothing else that we can do. Can you see the signs?. Have we lost our minds?. Looks like we've fallen. Feels like we've fallen. Down and down we go. Never felt so low. Can't hear you callin'. So maybe we're already gone. Can you see the signs?. Have we lost our minds?. Looks like we've fallen. Maybe we're already. Down and down we go. Never felt so low. Can't hear you callin'. So maybe we're already gone"
no surprise,"I've practiced this for hours, gone round and round. And now I think that I've got it all down. And as I say it louder I love how it sounds. Cause I'm not taking the easy way out. Not wrapping this in ribbons. Shouldn't have to give a reason why.... It's NO SURPRISE I won't be here tomorrow. I can't believe that I stayed till today. Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow. But I know in time we'll find this was NO SURPRISE. It came out like a river once I let it out. When I thought that I wouldn't know how. Held onto it forever just pushing it down. Felt so good to let go of it now. Not wrapping this in ribbons. Shouldn't have to give a reason why. It's NO SURPRISE I won't be here tomorrow. I can't believe that I stayed till today. There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow. There's nothing here in this soul left to say. Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow. God know we tried to find an easier way. Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow. But I know in time we'll find this was NO SURPRISE. Our favorite place we used to go. The warm embrace that no one knows. The loving look that's left your eyes. That's why this comes as no, as NO SURPRISE. If I could see the future and how this plays out. I bet it's better than where we are now. But after going through this, it's easier to see the reason why. It's NO SURPRISE I won't be here tomorrow. I can't believe that I stayed till today. Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow. But I know in time we'll find this was NO SURPRISE. The kiss goodnight, it comes with me. Both wrong and right, our memories. The whispering before we sleep, j. Just one more thing that you can't keep. Our favorite place we used to go. The warm embrace that no one knows. The loving look that's left your eyes. But I know in time we'll find this was NO SURPRISE"
on the inside,Your life is like a crack in the mirror. 7 years of bad luck it aint getting better now. Not till all is said and done. Reflection in the window is the same old face. Background small town everywhere you look around. Tell me what you're runnin from. Flip a coin and let it land in your hand. Heads you gonna stay but its tails. [Chorus]. So you can move to another town. Hide where you're sure you wont be found. But its still just you on the inside. You can pretend it'll be alright. Said it to yourself but you know its just a lie. Cause its still just you on the inside. Still you on the inside.... [Verse 2]. Nothin faster than the speed of your leavin. A hundred miles an hour and there aint no slowin down. But you can't outrun yourself. Hey you can say you fit in like a joker in the deck. But now you're skipping like a broken record goin round. You're the last to ask for help. You flip a coin and let it land in your hand. Heads you gonna stay but its tails. [Chorus]. So you can move to another town. Hide where you're sure you wont be found. But its still just you on the inside. You can't pretend it'll be alright. Said it to yourself but you know its just a lie. Cause its still just you on the inside. Still you on the inside. [Bridge]. Its never really been a question of how far. And at the end of every destination there you are. [Ending chorus]. You can move to another town. Hide where you're sure you won't be found. But its still just you on the inside. You can pretend it will be alright. No matter how you sell it. When you tell it its a lie. Cause its still just you on the inside. Still you on the inside (you can go and change and to me you'll always be the same). Still you on the inside (you can try and run and know you'll always be the same inside). Still you on the inside (you can go and change and to me you'll always be the same). Still you on the inside (you can try and run and know you'll always be the same inside). Still love you on the inside.

open up your eyes,A single rose left to remember. As a single tear falls from her eye. Another cold day in december. A year from the day she said goodbye. It seems it's only been a moment. Since the angels took him from her arms. She was left there. Holding on to their tomorrow. But as they lay him in the ground. Her heart would sing without a sound. For the first time you can open your eyes. And see the world without your sorrow. Where no one knows the pain you left behind. And all the peace you could never find. It's waiting there to hold and keep you. Welcome to the first day of your life. Just open up your eyes. Eyes. A single lifetime lays behind her. As she draws her final breath. Just beyond the door he'll find her. Taking her hand he softly says. For the first time you can open your eyes. And see the world without your sorrow. Where no one knows the pain you left behind. All the the peace you could never find. It's waiting there to hold and keep you. Welcome to the first day of your life. Just open up your eyes. As I lay you down tonight. Safe on the other side. No more tears to cry. For the first time you can open your eyes. And see the world without your sorrow. Where no one knows the pain you left behind. Or the peace you could never find. It's waiting there to hold and keep you. Welcome to the first day of your life. Just open up your eyes. Eyes. Eyes. Eyes
outta my head,I thought it would be easy. But it ain't for me. It's kinda hard when you lay your heart. On a one-way street. I really thought by now. You would've slipped my mind. But the kind of love sent from above. Is the killing kind. Put my mind to rest and try to sleep it off. It'll be alright when the morning comes. Or am I wrong?. Ain't no doubt about it. I can't live without it. Tried to forget you. But I can't get you outta my head. Just when I think you're gone. You come back and turn it on. And just like a simple song. I can't get you outta my head. Well I saw you dancin'. Dancin' in my dreams. I saw your face and I can't erase. All the things I've seen. Even if I try. Cause Lord knows I've tried. I can't escape. And I can't shake the pain inside. Crazy when she comes and crazy as she goes. I'm holding out my hands with nothing left to show. Guess that's the way it goes. Ain't no doubt about it. I can't live without it. Tried to forget you. But I can't get you outta my head. Just when I think you're gone. You come back and turn it on. And just like a simple song. I can't get you outta my head. Can't get you outta my head. Can't get you outta my head. Crazy when she comes and crazy as she goes. I'm holding out my hands with nothing left to show. Guess that's the way it goes. Can't get you outta my head. Ain't no doubt about it. I can't live without it. Tried to forget you. But I can't get you outta my head. Just when I think you're gone. You come back and turn it on. And just like a simple song. I can't get you outta my head. Can't get you outta my head. Can't get you outta my head
over you,"Now that it's all said and done,. I can't believe you were the one. To build me up and tear me down,. Like an old abandoned house.. What you said when you left.

And I never thought I'd doubt you,. I'm better off without you. More than you, more than you know.. I'm slowly getting closure.. I guess it's really over.. I'm finally getting better.. And now I'm picking up the pieces.. From spending all of these years. Putting my heart back together.. 'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through,. I got over you.. You took a hammer to these walls,. Dragged the memories down the hall,. Packed your bags and walked away.. There was nothing I could say.. And when you slammed the front door shut,. A lot of others opened up,. So did my eyes so I could see. That you never were the best for me.. Well, I never saw it coming.. And I should've started running. A long, long time ago.. And I never thought I'd doubt you,. I'm better off without you. More than you, more than you know.. I'm slowly getting closure.. I guess it's really over.. I'm finally getting better..

what have we become,"All those years. One day changes everything, and. Gone and your life and the passion fades away. Saving for something. That you'll never see in your days. Shutting out everything that you need. (Looking through distorted eyes). Beautiful disaster. (Adding up a million lies). So much for ""ever after"". Building up your wall. Everything you wanted. Fit the pieces into holes we used to crowd away. Giving in or leaving this now. Now we have what we have become. All the tears. We never thought we'd see the day when. The trappings of your life would seem to disappear. Goin through the vacancy you leave behind. Not what you have promised,. Not what you believed. (Looking through distorted eyes). Beautiful disaster. (Adding up a million lies). So much for ""ever after"". Building up your wall. Everything you wanted. Fit the pieces into holes we used to crowd away. Finding out the truth, when nothing really matters. Chase the light that's blinding even as you crowd away. Now we have what we have become. Now you fight to ease your pain. Now you know it's not the way out. Now you know it's not the way out. Not the way out. Building up your wall. Everything you wanted. Fit the pieces into holes we used to crowd away. Finding out the truth, when nothing really matters. Chase the light that's blinding even as you crowd away. Now we have what we have become"
what i meant to say,"I woke up today. Sinkin' like the stones that you have thrown. Wounded by the same old shots you take. It's easier to kick me when I'm low. And I just thought that you should know. That i've been holding on while you've been letting go. Well, it's not too late to say it right this time. 'Cause I know I said I'm sorry. But that's not what I meant to say. Strong enough to say. That I don't wanna take the high road now. S-S-So typical of you to walk away. When your perfect little world is burning down. And I just thought that you should know. That I've been holding on while you've been. letting go. Can I be so bold. 'Cause all this sucking up to you's just getting old. Well it's not too late to say it right this time. 'Cause I know I said I'm sorry. But that's not what I meant to say. Ah,. What I really meant to say. With every little breath I take. I'm not the only one who makes mistakes. Just think of all the ones you've made. And I just thought that you should know. That I've been holding on while you've been. letting go. Can I be so bold?.

what i want (feat. slash),"It always seemed that I was sorry for the things that I did. But never did a thing about it 'til I let you in. It's kinda funny about the time that I was falling apart. You came and put me back together, now. 'Cause what I want. And what I need. Has now become the same thing. You've been offering. As days go by. I've finally become what you want me to be. I still remember all the stupid things that I've said and done. But still, you stuck around with me. When all your friends said, ""Run!"". Givin' me a name, I found myself inside all the flames. Becoming everything for you again. What I want. And what I need. Has now become the same thing. You've been offering. As days go by. I've finally become what you want me to be. Don't tell me you saw it all along. God help me, I never knew it alone. Guess I was wrong. What I want. And what I need. Has now become the same thing. You've been offering. As days go by. I've finally become what you want me to be. And what I need. Has now become the same thing. You've been offering. You've taken me. And shape me to what you want me to be"
white flag,"I lost my words lingering in the dark. Hard times, don't you know we've seen them all. Ain't one to preach. Ain't one to speak on what I don't know. I lay that burden down. With one hand, we're reaching for the sky. And one hand, holding on for life. I won't raise my, I won't raise my white flag. In this life. The moment I surrender, bury me in the ground. I'd die before you see me take a bow. You know we all got, you know we all got. You know we all got a lot to lose. I won't surrender, praise the lord but soul to take. Thank God I live to die another day. You know we all got, you know we all got. You know we all got a lot to lose. I won't raise my white flag. 'Till I'm through. I found my way following a trail of hurt. 'Cause my name ain't no stranger to the dirt. It's been dragged around, it's been kicked around. They left it lyin' there for dead, whoa. But I defy before I lose the right. And take the time to watch the river rise. I won't raise my, I won't raise my white flag. In this life. The moment I surrender, bury me in the ground.

I never will forget the disgrace on. your face so full of love. Will it ever be enough?. Ten feet tall and bullet proof,. I never thought that I had a thing to lose. Well it looks like after all.
