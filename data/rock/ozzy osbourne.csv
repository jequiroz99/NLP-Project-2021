in my life,There are places I remember. All my life though some have changed. Some forever not for better. Some have gone and some remain. All these places have their moments. With lovers and friends I still can recall. Some are dead and some are living. In my life I've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers. There is no one compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning. When I think of love as something new. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life I love you more. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them.

But just like the wounded. And when it's too late. They'll remember. They'll surrender. Never a care for the people who hate. Underestimate me now. But a shot in the dark. One step away from you. A shot in the dark. Nothing that you can do. A shot in the dark. Always creeping up on you. All right.

May not have mattered. Take another point of view. Doubts will arise though. Like chasing a rainbow. I can tell a thing or two. That's true. You've got to believe in yourself. Or no one will believe in you. Imagination like a bird on the wing. Flying, free for you to use. OK baby. I can't believe they stop and stare. And point their fingers doubting me. Their disbelief suppresses them. But they're not blind. It's just that they won't see. I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver. Mountains move before my eyes. Destiny planned out I don't need no handout. Speculation of the wise."

bark at the moon,"Screams break the silence. Waking from the dead of night. Vengence is boiling. He's returned to kill the light. Then when he's found who he's looking for. Listen in awe and you'll hear him. Bark at the moon. Hahaha. Years spent in torment. Buried in a nameless grave. Now he has risen. Miracles would have to save. Those that the beast is looking for. Listen in awe and you'll hear him. Bark at the moon. Hey yeah bark at the moon. They cursed and buried him. Along with shame. And thought his timeless soul had gone. In empty burning hell - unholy one. But he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong. Oh yeah baby. Howling in shadows. Living in a lunar spell. He finds his heaven. Spewing from the mouth of hell. Those that the beast is looking for. Listen in awe and you'll hear him. Bark at the moon. Hey yeah. Bark at the moon. Hey yeah bark at the moon. Oh oh yeah bark at the moon. (Auuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu)"
believer,"Watching time go and feeling belief grow. Rise above the obstacles. People beseech me. But they will never teach me. Things that I already know. I know. Dreams that I have shattered. May not have mattered. Take another point of view. Doubts will arise though. Like chasing a rainbow. I can tell a thing or two. That's true. You've got to believe in yourself. Or no one will believe in you. Imagination like a bird on the wing. Flying, free for you to use. OK baby. I can't believe they stop and stare. And point their fingers doubting me. Their disbelief suppresses them. But they're not blind. It's just that they won't see. I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver. Mountains move before my eyes. Destiny planned out I don't need no handout. Speculation of the wise."

diary of a madman,Screaming at the window. Watch me die another day. Hopeless situation. Endless price I have to pay. Sanity now it's beyond me there's no choice. Diary of a madman. Walk the line again today. Entries of confusion. Dear diary I'm here to stay. Manic depression befriends me. Hear his voice. Sanity now it's beyond me. There's no choice. A sickened mind and spirit. The mirror tells me lies. Could I mistake myself for someone. Who lives behind my eyes. Will he escape my soul. Or will he live in me. Is he tryin' to get out or tryin' to enter me. Voices in the darkness. Scream away my mental health. Can I ask a question. To help me save me from myself. Enemies fill up the pages. Are they me. Monday till Sunday in stages. Set me free.
diggin' me down,"You're saving the saved, men and women enslaved. Propagating the messiah conception. The rich getting richer, paint You into the picture. Give the poor immaculate deception. Where are You father, why don't You save us?. The fallen are dying alone. How can You turn off their cries?. Ignore a new genocide. So come on, Jesus. We're all here waiting just for You. How long must we keep on waiting?. The faithful and blind are keepin' me keepin' me down. How long 'cause my faith is breaking. The pure and divine are diggin' me diggin' me down. Do You live in the light or in the dead of the night?. Sanctimonious promises broken. Hypocritical sin dying slowly within. Is the sacred truth forever unspoken?. Life ever after bohemian rapture. Beware the dark side of the son. You're just a self-made messiah. Selling brimstone and fire. So come on, Jesus. Don't keep us waiting just for You. How will I know You Mr. Jesus Christ?. Have You already been here once or twice?. The son of man or obsolete facade. How will I know that You're the son of God?"

Nowhere you can hide. So don't blame me. There's no guarantee, what you get is what you see. Don't try to find it, just don't try. Don't try living in the past if you want your dreams to last. Don't hide behind the mask of lies. Like goin' nowhere. Like goin' nowhere baby. Nowhere baby. Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere. It's a vision, not religion. And the truth is plain to see. It's a feeling, it's revealing. So don't blame me. Don't blame me. Don't blame me. Don't blame me. Deep inside of me lives a hunger to be free. I know I'll have to pay the price.

You think i'm kinda crazy, but i gotta few regrets. Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits. We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget. I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect. Like willie mays. My eyes purple haze, my solar razor burn through shades. My grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page. I glide like, hovercrafts on the everglades. Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher. Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture. Limited edition composition spark friction. Non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant. Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence. Wu original, true colors step from the melanin. The most high, most try, to get close by. And overthrow i, but choke, with they hopes up high. I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the richter. Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga. The crowd seducer black your third eye before i lose ya. Verbal high i leave stars in the eyes of medusa. Top ten, parley like cochran, it's often. Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman. Murder rap, kill you soft like roberta flack. Words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks. You think i'm kinda crazy, but i gotta few regrets.

A spark that surges through the undergrowth. Overwhelmin the populace from the entry. The wu-tang dynasty, has emerged. From this elite fleet. I was appointed to strike the vital nerve. Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words. Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe. Seeds of mc's at these fake ass industry niggaz. Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off and spray. An array of shots that travel downwind. Just respect pyrhiffic pen. As i send, the minds of the weak. To rise and take power i blew tower-ing over the land. As we stand, expanding our cream. A dollar to every grain of sand. Let the mind use the physical as planned. You think i'm kinda crazy, but i gotta few regrets. Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits. We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget. I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect. Beirut. Try to comprehend check out my new suit. Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction. Dissapear from here, my year, drop the stupid lp's everywhere. Fallin out the sky tall sniper. Raps by cappadonna hit the countryside. Poetry whirlpool, rza and true collide. We produce article exception to the rule. We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled. Cats that made that watergate thing go spoiled. The heavy-handed, locked down stranged with cyrus. Wu pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes. Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers. Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers. Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven. Slang reverand, put the best work in. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Wu, yo. Oh, baby"

i ain't no nice guy,"When i was young i was the nicest guy i knew. I thought i was the chosen one. But time went by and i found out a thing or two. My shine wore off as time wore on. I thought that i was living out the perfect life. But in the lonely hours when the truth begins to bite. I thought about the times when i turned my back & stalled.. I ain't no nice guy after all. When i was young i was the only game in town. I thought i had it down for sure. But time went by and i was lost in what i found. The reasons blurred, the way unsure. I thought that i was living life the only way. But as i saw that life was more than day to day. I turned around, i read the writing on the wall.. I ain't no nice guy after all. I ain't no nice guy after all. In all the years you spend between your birth and death. You find there's lots of times you should have saved your breath. It comes as quite a shock when that trip leads to a fall.. I ain't no nice guy after all. I ain't no nice guy after all"

in my life,There are places I remember. All my life though some have changed. Some forever not for better. Some have gone and some remain. All these places have their moments. With lovers and friends I still can recall. Some are dead and some are living. In my life I've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers. There is no one compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning. When I think of love as something new. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life I love you more. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life I love you more. In my life I love you more...
in the end,"It Starts with one thing. I don't know why. It doesn't even matter how hard you try. Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme. To explain in due time. All I know. Time is a valuble thing.

Trying to hold on. But didn't evn know. I wasted it all just to watch you go. I kept everything inside. And even though I tried, It all fell apart. What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when. I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter. I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter. One thing. I don't know why. It doesn't even matter how hard you try. Keep that in mind. I designed this rhyme. To remind myself how i tried so hard. In spite of the way you were mocking me. Acting like I was part of your property. Remembering all the times you fought with me. I'm surprised it got so far. Things aren't the way they were before. You wouldn't even reckognize me anymore. Not that you knew me back then. But it all comes back to me in the end. I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart. What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when. I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter. I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter. I put my trust in you. Pushed as far as I could go. For all this, there's only one thing you should know. I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter. I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter"

life won't wait,"I watch it all change. Take the news of the day. And throw it away. Time will kill all the pain. Fate will cure the decay. Of all this blind ambition. The greed brings us together. Stay strong. Stay true. Be brave. It all comes down to you. Try to just let it go. Know that justice moves slow. But it comes in the end. Rise, the guilty will fall. Stay, they can't take it all. They want the unimportant. It's love they leave behind. Stand up. Aim true. Keep heart. The future looks to you. Every second you throw away. Every minute of every day. Don't get caught in a memory. Life won't wait for you. No life won't wait for you my friend. I'm watching the change. Who will carry the flame?. It all feels very strange. Dreams that men can be good. Faith to live as we should. And know we're all connected. We give ourselves the power. Stay strong. Stay true. Be brave. It all comes down to you. Every day that you wait. You're falling faster. No slight of hand, no twist of fate. No ever after. When it's gone it's gone. A fight 'til the bitter end. Life won't wait for you no. Life won't wait for you my friend.

Tell your mamma that you're gonna be late. But not to worry we'll just be rockin' all night. The lighting strikes before you hear the thunder roar. We're becoming the children of the night. I'm not apologizing. I am what I am. There is no compromising. I don't give a damn. Until I feel the thunder boiling in my veins. I won't stop. Rockin' all night, rockin' all night.

Until the lightning strikes again. Rockin' all night, rockin' all night. Until the lightning strikes again"

I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through.. I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now. I told them I had ridden shooting stars. And said I'd show them how.. Over and over always tried to get away. Living in a daydream only place I had to stay. Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide. People around me talking to the walls inside. I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now. I told them I had ridden shooting stars. And said I'd show them how.. Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me. You don't need a ticket to ride with me - I'm free.. Over and under in between the ups and downs. My mind's carpet magic ride goes round and round.. Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds. Watching my body disappear into the crowd.. Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me. You don't need a ticket to fly with me - I'm free."

planet caravan,"We sailed through endless skies. Stars shine like eyes. The black night sighs. The moon in silver trees. Falls down in tears. Light of the night. The earth, a purple blaze. Of sapphire haze in orbital ways. While down below the trees. Bathed in cool breeze. Silver starlight breaks dawn from night. And so we pass on by. The crimson eye of great god Mars. As we travel the universe"

rock 'n' roll rebel,They couldn't see what I though would be so obvious. They hide behind the laws that they make for all of. us. The ministry of truth that deals with pretense. The ministry of peace that sits on defense. I'm washing my hands of what they're tryin' to do. I'm breaking the rules and its for me and for you. I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel. I'll tell you no lies. They think I worship the devil. They only see through his eyes. I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel. They live their lives in fear and insecurity. And all you do is pay for their prosperity. The ministry of fear that won't let you live. The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive. Do what you will to try and make me conform. But I'll make you wish that you had never been born. Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel. I'll do as I please. I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel. I'm as free as the breeze. I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel. They'll try playin with your heart. The know it rules you head. They only feel what bigotry feels. They won't fool with me again (oh no). . God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious. Is it because that they manifest the incubus. The ministry of war that got caught in the draught. The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed. When it's all boiled down and the days at an end. I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend. Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel. I'll tell you no lies. They say I worship the Devil. Why don't they open their eyes....I'm just etc..

s.a.t.o.,Now I'll find peace of mind. Finally found a way of thinking. Tried the rest found the best. Stormy day won't see me sinking. I can't conceal it like I know I did before. I got to tell you now the ship is ready. Waiting on the shore. Dare to look face the test on the eve. When you set sailing. What you've learned what you've earned. Ship of joy will stop you failing. I can't conceal it like I know I did before. I got to tell you now the ship is ready. Waiting on the shore. Wind is high so am I. As the shore sinks in the distance. Dreams unfold seek the gold. Gold that's brighter than sunlight. Sail away see the day. Dawning on a new horizon. Gold's insight shining bright. Brighter than the sun that's rising. 3000 sails on high are straining in the wind. A raging sea below. Is this voyage coming to an end.

snowblind,"What you get and what you see. Things that don't come easily. Feeling happy in my vein. Iceciles within my brain. Something blowing in my head. Winter's ice, it soon will spread. Death would freeze my very soul. Makes me happy, makes me cold. My eyes are blind but I can see. The snowflakes glisten on the tree. The sun no longer sets me free. I feel there's no place freezing me. Let the winter sun shine on. Let me feel the frost of dawn. Fill my dreams with flakes of snow. Soon I'll feel the chilling glow. Don't you think I know what I'm doing. Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong. You're the one who's really a loser. This is where I feel I belong. Crystal world with winter flowers.

soul sucker,"The cold words deafen. And silence long forgotten. The logic never reclaimed. The anger rises. Sometimes there's no surrender. No white flag flies. You won't like me when I'm angry. Stop talking to me. Just like I don't even bleed. This cross is heavy when. You're my soul sucker. Get out of my face. The past is running in place. The silvers cut me as you. Suck the soul right out of me. Soul sucker. You bite down deeper. Your tongue can cut a heart out. You've passed the point of return. The storm lightens. Get ready for the whiplash. Don't think don't speak. Don't, my patience turns to violence. Stop talking to me. Just like I don't even bleed. This cross is heavy when. You're my soul sucker. Get out of my face. The past is running in place. The silvers cut me as you. Suck the soul right out of me. Soul sucker. I'm just a solitary man who wants to live. A quiet life before when I cease to exist. I don't need resistence for the things I can't control. Just turn away and let it go. Stop talking to me. Just like I don't even bleed. This cross is heavy when. You're my soul sucker. Get out of my face. The past is running in place. The silvers cut me as you. Suck the soul right out of me. Soul sucker"
spiders,Spiders in the night. Creeping round the walls. Now you'll feel him crawling over you. Creepy crawly things. Filling up your bed. Soon you'll feel him crawling through your. Brain. You think he's there. Beware his bite. But when you look. The spider's not in sight. Spiders reappear. Taking people's names. Everything is taken down in sane. There's no way out. And there's no key. But here's a clue. The spider's really me. You're written in his book. The spiders won't forget. You won't forget the spiders in the night. The end is growing nigh. Eensy weensy friends. The spider's disappearing from the night. You think he's gone. You think he's dead. There's no escape. The spider's in your head.

suicide solution,"Wine is fine. But whiskey's quicker. Suicide is slow with liquor. Take a bottle drown your sorrows. Then it floods away tomorrow. Away tomorrow. Evil thoughts and evil doings. Cold, alone you hang in ruins. Thought you'd escape the reaper. You can't escape the master keeper. 'Cause you feel life's unreal. And you're living a lie. Such a shame who's to blame. And you're wondering why. Then you ask from your cask. ""Is there life after birth""?. What you sow can mean hell on this earth. Hell on this earth. Now you live inside a bottle. The reaper's traveling at full throttle. It's catching you but you don't see. The reaper is you and the reaper is me. Breaking laws,. Knocking doors. But there's no one at home. Make your bed,. Rest your head. But you lie there and moan. Where to hide,. Suicide is the only way out. Don't you know what it's really about. Wine is fine. But whiskey's quicker. Suicide is slow with liquor. Take a bottle drown your sorrows. Then it floods away tomorrow."

Seventh night the unicorn is waiting in the skies. A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies. Yeah. Take my hand, my child of love come step inside my tears. Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years. When our love will ride away into eternal skies. A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies. Yeah.

We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love."

that i never had,All these tears I cry. Don't you wonder why. Is it all a dream. Never what it seems. Gets under my skin. Should I let you in. Don't you think it's bad. To give me something that I never had. Every word I say. Everytime I pray. Look into my eyes. Distant voices cry. Is there light in me. Tell me what you see. You are what I have. Can't get something that I never had. Can't get something that I never had. Should I think about tomorrow ohh. Should I live for just today. Take the light that burns inside you. Let it burn away. Let it burn away. Let it burn away. Will I see the day. Will I have to pay. What's inside of me. You will never see. Won't you let me in. Don't you let me see. Do you think I'm bad. Cause I want something that I never had. Cause I want something that I never had. Give me something that I never had. Give me something that I never had.
the liar,"You ask me the time of day. I tell you I don't know. In darkness I'm light years away. The voices come and go. Save me, all my life I've been a liar. Burning bridges in the rain. The crying embryo. I seem so blissfully insane. But still the pain won't go. Save me, all my life I've been a liar. Sacred words the angels wait for me. They'll set me free. But I can see the joke's on me. Babies crying other peoples tears. And in their eyes. They have reflected wasted years. You ask me who I really am. I still say I don't know. The doors have all been tightly slammed. The poison seeds are sown. Save me, all my life I've been a liar. Dying angels falling from above. I've had enough I cannot laugh. The joke's on me. Shattered dreams you cannot realize. Won't sympathize, it's in your eyes. Why can't you see?. Am I the liar?. Tell me who's the liar"
the ultimate sin,Overkill enough is enough. There's nothing left of me to devour. You've had your fill I'm all I have left. What can stop your hunger for power. 'Cos you took advantage of things that I said. Now the feeling is dead. And that's the ultimate sin. And that's the ultimate sin. Anyway I look at it now. The doors are closed and cannot be opened. Bury your anger and bury your dead. Or you'll be left with nothing and no one. There's no point in screaming 'cos you won't be heard. Now that tables have turned. It was the ultimate sin. It was the ultimate sin. It was the ultimate sin. I warned you then and I'm warning you now. If you mess with me you're playing with fire. Winds of change that are fanning the flames. Will carry you to your funeral pyre. It's pulling you down. It's your final descent. It's too late to repent. When it's the ultimate sin. When it's the ultimate sin. When it's the ultimate sin. When it's the ultimate sin
the wizard,"Misty morning, clouds in the sky. Without warning, the wizard walks by. Casting his shadow, weaving his spell. Funny clothes, tinkling bell. Never talking. Just keeps walking. Spreading his magic. Evil power disappears. Demons worry when the wizard is near. He turns tears into joy. Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by. Never talking. Just keeps walking. Spreading his magic. Sun is shining, clouds have gone by. All the people give a happy sigh. He has passed by, giving his sign. Left all the people feeling so fine. Never talking. Just keeps walking. Spreading his magic."

thunder underground,"Your thoughts are compromising. Self-centered patronized. Your image supersedes your soul. You find me mystifying. Subhuman, so annoying. You can't have me under control. You think you live forever. You don't find that profound. You won't think you're so clever. When you hear thunder underground. All right now. Your morbid fear of losing. Destroys the lives you're using. You only have one point of view. The stigma of delusion. Confirms your self illusion. And after all this could be you. When you hear thunder underground. Here we go now. Could it be that I have found my mind. Or have I gone insane. Roller coaster of the madness and there's only me to blame. The ever faithful hand of doom will take the pain away. I'll never know the answer to it all 'til my dying day. Your bullshit culture licking. Can't stop the deathwatch ticking. You're only mortal after all. Your appetite for power. Subverts your every hour. But every time the mighty fall"

Start living for today. This life fading away. This life tickin' like a time bomb. Ready to blow your tortured mind. I know it's wasting away. We don't plan for when it goes wrong. The time that we lose we will never find time. Just live every moment of each day. 'Cause death is the price we all must pay. This life fading away. This life tickin' like a time bomb. Ready to blow your tortured mind. I know it's wasting away. We don't plan for when it goes wrong. The time that we lose we will never find time. This life fading away.

time after time,Time after time. I guess that love is blind. I couldn't read you mind. Line after line. Line after line. It was written in your eyes. I guess it's no surprise. Time after time. I can hear them whispering. Shadows in the rain. Thinking how it might have been. Time after time. Line after line. You broke me. Day after day. I watched love fade away. I wanted love to stay.

You better start to worry,. 'Cause I may not make it back. All right now. You don't have to leave the lights on. I'm so used to being blind,. One good reason to blow me away. So it's,.

tonight,"Now I'm back out on the streets again. It never rains unless it pours. Try to get back on my feet again. I hear the raging thunder as it roars. Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody. Or am I right. Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery. I just can't fight no more. I hear the questions surface my mind. Of the mistakes that I have made.. Times and places have left behind. And am I ever gonna make the grade. Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody. Or am I right. Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery. I just can't fight no more. As I beat my head against the wall. Running around in circles in vain. I'm feeling three foot tall. You don't understand I'm fading away. Don't want your pity or your sympathy. It isn't gonna prove a thing to me. Good intentions pave the way to hell. Don't worry when you hear me sing. Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody. Or am I right. Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery. I just can't fight no more."
trap door,"Can you see your reflection. False strength, hollow protection. Run from pain and rejection. The truth stabs again. Till the skin is broken. And the cut is open. And the words once spoken. Just fade away. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door. Big head leads to confusion. Strong heart pumps up delusion. Tough talk, one voice communion. Medicate the pain. Justify your ego. Living with denial. And the thoughts so vile. Won't fade away. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door. It's coming. You're falling. You're on your own with no one left to blame. Can't sleep? 'cause you've made your own bed. The sentence of the helpless. Sink deep to the trial in your head. The court of the selfish. Why? Tell me why?. Can't evade or escape the reality. A true lie and a broken promise. A Judas and a doubting Thomas. A tragedy just to keep you honest. Guilty always fall. Through the trap door. Fear the trap door. Through the trap door. The trap door, the trap door. No fear, too scared to look up. Can't win, nothing but bad luck. Clock ticks, your time to face up. You can't run for long. When your world is broken. Your trap door is open. The very words you choke on. Just fade away. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door. Too late, standing on the trap door"

waiting for darkness,"Waiting for darkness. Doesn't anybody see. Deafened by silence. Doesn't anybody hear. (I'm waiting for darkness). Playing with fire. But they're screaming. When they're burned. Out of the sunlight. Hasn't anybody learned. I know what they find. Is in their mind. It's what they want to see. spare me from the light. Here comes the night. And here I'll stay. Waiting for darkness. Promise me rebirth. And then you tear me from the womb. Give me my freedom. And then you lock me in a tomb. I'm waiting for darkness. You gotta believe, you gotta believe it's true. I'm waiting for darkness. I just can't conceive why darkness is overdue. Who knows the answers. Is it friend or is it foe. Don't ask me questions. There are things you shouldn't know."
