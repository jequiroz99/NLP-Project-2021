fireside,I can't explain but I want to try. There's this image of you and I. And it goes dancing by in the morning. And in the night time. There's all these secrets that I can't keep. Like in my heart there's that hotel suite. And you lived there so long. It's kinda strange now you're gone. I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found. Has it gone for good?. Or is it coming back around?. Isn't it hard to make up your mind?. When you're losing and your fuse is fireside. There's all those places we used to go. And I suspect you already know.

Your thoughts bearing up with mine. And when you're so pretty and I'm so shy. You probably didn't give me the eye. But I'm sure you did. Well I went outside. Couldn't say I tried. And I felt regret. Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in. Cause the ship hasn't sailed yet. But when I did I couldn't see your face. I could see your mates but that wouldn't do.

a certain romance,"Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks. Or knackered Converse. Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks. But all of that's what the point is not. The point's that there isn't no romance around there. And there's the truth that they can't see. They'd probably like to throw a punch at me. And if you could only see them, then you would agree. Agree that there isn't no romance around there. You know. it's a funny thing you know. We'll tell them if you like. We'll tell them all tonight. They'll never listen. Cause their minds are made up. And course it's all okay to carry on that way. Over there there's broken bones. There's only music, so that there's new ringtones. And it doesn't take no Sherlock Holmes.

temptation greets you like your naughty friend,"""I don't ever want to hate you so don't show me your bed. the only roads are cul-de-sac's"". The first thing that she said. ""Temptation greets you like your naughty mate. the one that used to get you in bother. But one you can't never bring yourself to hate. "". And she said. ""We've got that spark, but it only lights a fuse. helps you see in the dark. But it's a sight you'll lose when. The temptation greets you like your naughty friend"". I don't ever want to hate you. so don't show me your bed. the only roads are cul-de-sacs. the only ends are dead. Temptation, greets you like your naughty mate. the one that made you steal and set things on fire. the one you havent seen of late. I said ""that kind of talk only adds intrigue. to the cauldron of thought?. that's already exceeding temptation"". The very thing that held her back. I don't ever want to hate you. so don't show me your bed. the only roads are cul de sacs. the only ends are dead. i don't ever want to hate you. it's not part of the plan. so keep your charm where i can't see it. and your arms where i can. [ (Dizzee Rascal) ]. We used to be tight. Me and my naughty friends. Caused pure madness in the ends. I mean day and night. We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight. Smoking, drinking, joyriding. Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding. Reckless youngsters, no direction. No sign of correction. But then I switched it up, changed my ways. Got in the area like, ""Oh my days"". But not my naughty friends, they're not fazed. Can't believe that this music pays. See no reason why we can't do. All the things that we've always done. Still in my heart I know that's just wrong. But it's hard to fight the temptation, son. The panic will fall down around you. If you dont do what i say. I don't ever want to hate you. so don't show me your bed. the only roads are cul de sacs. the only ends are dead. I don't ever want to hate you. it's not part of the plan. so keep your charm where I can't see it. and your arms where you can"

But it,s alright. She's sayin that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me. He's not the jealous type. And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away. But when there's no excuses.

She murmors things to confirm that the tragedy is true. And I knew how could she could have anyone she wants. And I'm strugglin to think of an immediate response. Like ""I don't mind. Be a big mistake. For you to wait. And let me waste your time. Really love, it's fine"". Said ""really love, it's fine"". And then the first time it occured. That there was something to destroy. I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy. Oh, but she carried on suggestin. A struggle to refuse. She said ""it's the red wine this time"". But that is no excuse"
the bakery,I wish you would have smiled in the bakery. Or sat on a tatty seatee. At a mutual friends gathering. And the more you keep on looking. The more it's hard to take. Love we're in stalemate. To never meet is surely where we're bound. There's one in every town. Just there to grind you down. I wish I would have seen you in the post office. Well maybe I did and I missed it.

the lovers (cover),"Up from the pastures of boredom. out from the sea of discontent. they come in packs like hungry hounds. the seekers of the dark enchantment.. They haunt the boulevards and bars. they pray to wishing wells and stars. they ride the hurricane of hope. not looking back but on they go. toward the distance and deceiving. and all the while they keep believing. they are special and apart. the lovers, the lovers of the heart. the lovers.. And when they pair off two by two. they feel they are the chosen few. and though their beds are made of straw. they feel like velvet in the night. and so the night is never ending. it's made of distance and pretending.

And when love comes again. and when love comes. hello!. rises from their throats like singing. catches in their hearts like wind. the good things. strangers in their arms are bringing. makes life all right... again.. They turn their faces to the light. no longer hiding in the night. so unashamed and unafraid. that they can face each others faults. and though the waltz will have it's ending. there is no harm in just pretending. that they are special and apart. the lovers, the lovers of the heart. the lovers."

I flew in some spiked meniscus. and he bought his own rope. and skipped against the rode. did start not to find the dark lead and catch that man i hope. devices man are closed. he lost all his foot holes. and with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face. he followed with obedience and fell in the nettles. Fell in the nettles, fell in the nettles. he was a toothpick and the garlic. And the cinder upon the pub. failed to blunt or hinder, a slow collapse. and clinging to the door frame he was trapped. after a reminder of where he had been. with a smile in his pocket and a scowl on his face. there was nowhere to flee. just had to tent in the nettles"
the ultracheese,"Still got pictures of friends on the wall. I suppose we aren't really friends anymore. Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing. friendly at all.

In a booth like we usually were. Every time there was a rocket launch. or some big event. What a death I died writing that song. From start to finish, with you looking on. It stays between us, Steinway, and his sons. Because it's the ultracheese. Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk. Dressed like a fictional character. From a place they called. America in the golden age. Trust the politics to come along. When you were just trying to orbit the sun. When you were just about to be. kind to someone. Because you had the chance.

And they're all looking quite full on. In bunny ears and devil horns. I want to see all of the things that we've already seen. I want to see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine. And put it all back in. You've got to understand it you can never beat the bandit. And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked. When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock.

And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end. Looking for trouble and there's lovers to be had. Those ones next to us are such lovely lads. Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze. And the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways. And we're forever unfulfilled. Can't think why. Like a search for murder clues. In dead man's eyes. Forever unfulfilled. And can't think why. Like a search for murder clues. In dead man's eyes. The more you open your mouth. The more you're forcing performance. All the attention is leading me to feel important. (completely obnoxious). Now that we're here, we may as well go too far. Wriggling around just so that you won't forget. There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect. Aimlessly gazing at the blazers in the queue. Struggling with the notion that it's life not film. This house is a circus, berserk as fuck. We tend to see that as a perk though. Look. What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend. And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end"
too much to ask,"The smiles as she walked in the room. Have all turned into frowns. Am I too quick to assume. That the love is no longer in bloom?. The tantrums and the tears. Play a very different tune to what they did before. Her heads red raw. And the ending doesn't sound like. They're happiest around. When you sobbed before it felt much more. Like the product of a squabble. Now there's reason for it to be something more. And no would be, oh, it's uncertain. Whether the curtain has shut for good. She says, ""See if it's still raining. I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me"". And I interrupt to receive the scowl and stare. But still decided to stop her there. Would it be outrageous to say. We're either shouting or we're shagging?. Locked in tempestuous phase. At least that's how we felt yesterday. The eyes are getting heavier. And whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery. Would a kiss be too much to ask?. When you fit me as Sunday's frozen pitch. Fits the thermos flask. It's a pity, it just hit me, we can't go back. To the chest touching on the back"

At the cemetery gates. 'Cause you're so dark, babe. But I want you hard. You're so dark, babe. You're so dark. You're so dark. You're so dark. And you're so mysterious. Got that obsession with death. I saw you driving your Prius. And even that was Munster Koach-esque. You watch Italian horror and you listen to The Scores. Leather-clad and spike collar. I want you down on all fours. 'Cause you're so dark, babe. But I want you hard. You're so dark, baby. I know you're nothing like mine. 'Cause she's walking on Sunshine. And your love would tear us apart. And I know I'm not your type. 'Cause I don't shun the daylight. But baby, I'm willing to start. (Ooh). You're so dark. Got your H. P. Lovecraft. (Lovecraft). Your Edgar Allan Poe. (Poe). Got your unkind of ravens. (Ravens). Got your murder of crows. You're so dark, babe. But I want you hard. You're so dark, baby. But I want you hard. You're so dark, oh. But I want you hard. You're so dark, baby"
