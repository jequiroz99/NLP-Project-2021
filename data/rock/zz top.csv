el diablo,"(Gibbons, Hill, Beard) 4:20. Did you ever hear the story. That happened not long ago. 'bout the man with a tan:. El diablo de Mexico?. And this man played his hand. And he lived by the luck of the draw;. Now and then and again,. Found him steppin' outside of the law. Hey, hey!. And his fortune he had made. let him live high on the hog. Til the day of the raid. When they hunted him like a dog.. He was out on the run,. Knowing he could get by,. 'Cause the men killed in sin. were not there to testify.. Hey, hey!. He was caught, he was bound. In La Casa de Calaboose.. He was tried; he was found. And readied for the noose.. But the break he would make,. It didn't turn out so well.. And the hombre called ""Diablo"". Bid his last farewell.."
enjoy and get it on,"(Gibbons, Hill, Beard) 3:23. Oh I'm makin' my way back home. Least that's what I told her on the phone. Been a while since I made her smile. And I know she gonna dig my style. Could you enjoy baby. Really enjoy gettin' it on. Could I get some pie ala mode. When I come in off the road. Do she still have her fightin' gear. Just one look is gonna make it clear. If she would enjoy baby. Really enjoyed gettin' it on. How does it feel holdin' me again. She's holdin' on like it gonna never end. Well I'm home thinkin' I should stay. While I'm here just let me hear you say. Say you enjoyed baby. Really enjoyed gettin' it on."
esther be the one,"Esther be the one that shoots a machine gun. Whether you like it or not.. Midnight or daylight, stay out of her sight. 'Cuz I heard she's one heck of a shot.. Esther be the one, she's the only one.. She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.. And you will feel her love bullets when you look her in the eyes.. There ain't no way to escape.. And that's when her fever will materialize,. But it ain't no unfortunate fate.. Esther be the one, she's the only one.. She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.. If she gets you in a corner, don't let her mess you 'round. And don't let her blow you away.. If you can't dig on Esther, you turn and leave town. 'cause if you think she's bad you ought to see her sister.. Esther be the one, but she's not the only one.. She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon."

funky cold medina,"So...cold cooling at a ball. and im looking for some action. but like Mick Jagger said. I can't get no satisfaction. the girls are all around. but none of them wanna get with me. my threads are fresh and I'm looking def. yo, wassup with the l-o-c. the girls are all jocking. at the other end of the bar. having drinks with some no-name chump. when they know that I'm the star. so I got up and strolled over. to the other side of the cantina. I asked the guy, ""why you so fly?"". he said ""funky cold medina"". this brother told me a secret. on how to get more chicks. put a little medina in your glass. and the girls'll come real quick. it's better than any alcohol. or afrodesiac. a couple of sips of this love potion and she'll be on your lap. so I gave some to my dog, when he began to big. and then he licked his bowl and he looked at me. and did the wild thing on my leg. he used to scratch and bite me. before he was much much meaner. but now all the poodles run to my house for the funky cold medina. you know what I'm saying. I got every dog in my neighborhood breaking down my door. I got Spuds McKenzie, Alex from Strolls. they won't leave my dog alone with that medina thing. I went up to this girl. she said ""Hi, my name Sheena"". I thought she'd be good to go with a little funk cold medina,. she said ""I'd like a drink"", I said ""ok, I'll go get it"". and then a couple of sips, she cold licked her lips and I knew that she was. with it. so I took her to my crib. and everything went well as planned. but when she got undressed it was big old mess. Sheena was a man. so I threw him out. I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer weiner. you must be sure that the girl is pure for the funky cold medina. you know,. ain't no plans with a man,. this is the 80s and I'm down the ladies,. break it down,. back in the saddle, looking for a little affection. I took a shot, I thought I'd test it on the Love Connection. the audience guests voted, and you know, they picked a winner. I took my date to the Hilton ford. media had some dinner. she had a few drinks, I'm thinking soon what I'd be getting,. but that's when she starting talking 'bout plans for a wedding,. I said ""wait, slow down love, not so fast, I'll be seeing ya"",. that's why I found you don't play around with the funky cold medina. you know what I'm saying. that medina's a monster y'all"

girl in a t-shirt,"Some girls gotta get coco chanel. Some get the luck of the draw. I got a girl lookin' naturally well. Hippest chick you ever saw. She like wearin' powder and paint. Wheelin' in a big Seville. She's big cheese with the maitre D's. Down at the bar and grill. Just a girl in a t-shirt. Girl in a t-shirt. Her reputation precedes her. In every boutique around. They get down on their knees to please her. She's throwin' that money down. Now don't get it wrong, please understand. She's barely keepin' up with the rent. But the finer labels and her car phone. Kepp her down to her very last cent. Just a girl in a t-shirt. Girl in a t-shirt. Everybody digs her, everybody try. Once you get past that femme fatale. Everybody knows she's fine. I had to get it and quit it and keep a cool head. It took me a pass or two. But her code's done cracked I want you to know. She's my baby through and through. Just a girl in a t-shirt. Girl in a t-shirt."

goin' down to mexico,"Words and music by Billy Gibbons, Bill Ham, Dusty Hill.. I was on my way down to Mexico,. there was trouble on the rise.. It was nothing more than I'd left behind,. which was much to my surprise.. I turned around and lit a cigarette. wiped the dust off of my boots.. When up ahead I saw the crowd,. I knew it was no use.. I'ts been the same way for Oh so long,. it looks like I'm singing the same old song.. A fine and fancy man was he,. doing good things for the poor.. Givin' rides in his rockin' Eighty-eight for free.. They could not hope for more.. When it came my turn he said to me,. ""Have I seen your face before?"". I said, ""Oh no, you must be wrong,. I'm from a distant shore.. So if you don't mind, I'll just move along. but it looks like I'm singin' the same old song."". A Nineteen Forty movie star. with a long forgotten name.. She was a sexy mess in her pleated dress,. still hangin' on to fame.. With forgotten lines she missed her cue. and left a glass of wine at home.. She was singin' the same song that I was.. Could we both be wrong?. So hand in hand we walked along,. each of us singin' the same old song.."
goin' so good,"Just when I have enough money to spend. And I was always thinking it would never end. Then the time came to the end of the game. Don't you know. And just when the sky got shiny and bright. There never seemed to be an end to the light. Then the clouds came, it started to rain. Don't you know. Just when it was goin'. Just when it was goin' so good. Just when it. Just when it was goin' so good. Just when the highway straightened out for a mile. And I was thinkin' I'd just cruise for a while. A fork in the road brought a new episode. Don't you know. Just when it. Just when it was goin' so good. Just when it was goin'. Just when it was goin' so good. Baby don't you worry. I said baby don't you cry. We're gonna get it together. And I know you're askin' why. Just when it. Just when it was goin' so good. Just when it was goin'. Just when it was goin' so good. Yeah.

He had slammed the door but I said no more. and I thought I'd breathed my last breath.. We was out in the sticks down Highway Six. and the crowd was just about right.. The speed was too, so out I flew. like a stick of rollin' dynamite.. When I hit the ground you could hear the sound. and see the sparks a country mile.. End over end I began to spin. but the ball started runnin' wild.. But it was too late as I met my fate. and the ball started gettin' hot.. But through the sparks and the flame I knew that the claim. of the Master of Sparks was gone.. - Billy Gibbons."

He winked; Said, ""Take a chance."". Don't you know, it happens ev'ry day.. I said it happens ev'ry day.. Mister Ten Dollar Man with that gun in your hand,. Can I get a case of those tonight?. And now you've got the order;. I said it's time to slip the border. Don't you know it happens every day. I said it happens every day."

two ways to play,"Somethin' crossed my mind again. You were in my eyes. It was somewhere out by Bombay. And I'm tellin' all those lies. I've been there and you've been there. And there ain't no mistake. We could take it anyway. But the one thing we can't fake. There's just two ways to play. Just two ways to play. And I don't want to stay. There's just two ways to play. And I'm gonna play it right, this time. Yeah. There's always the easy numbers. There's those hard ways too. There's those cheaters blunders. It's either one of two. But fortune telling's mezmorizing. In the game of chance. But rollin' dice ain't sympathizing. When you play romance. There's just two ways to play. Just two ways to play. And I don't want to stay. There's just two ways to play. I can't control the numbers. I can't control your sexy ways. I can't control my inner thunder. It makes me want????????. Two ways to play. There's Just two ways to play. There's just two ways to play. There's just two ways to play. I'm gonna play it right this time. There's two ways to play. There's just two ways to play. Two ways to play.

And out con nalgas fried. Night descends, and the fun begins. Way out the other side. But, I didn't say it. Oh, no. Vincent Price said it's alright. Vincent Price said it's OK. There's a very cherry charmer. Oozin' groovin' grease. She come in with the graveyard shift. A pleasin' teasin' squeeze. El jeffe [sic] holler mucho mas. Get some sucker's ass inside. I think you'll know you gotta go. To get some satisfy. But, I didn't say it. Oh, no. Vincent Price said it's alright. Vincent Price said it's OK. I've dined at Spago and Eclipse. And Whataburger too. I've had Mescal with lotsa gals. Along 5th Avenue. I always shot the best they got. Dinero no problema. Ain't no quarter south-the-border. In this off the wall cantina. But, I didn't say it. Oh, no.

What's up with that. What's up with that. What's up with that. What's up with that. Everybody want a little more. Than they think they got. But what you might think it is,. Might really not be, baby. Pick it up or leave it lay. It always seem to slip away. What's up with that. What's up with that. What's up with that. What's up with that. Now how high will a river get. Before it overflows. And how long is the hole to China. It don't really know. This is what it's all about. There's always gonna be a doubt. What's up with that. What's up with that. What's up with that. What's up with that."

world of swirl,"I hit the street running, had an angle in mind. Looking for a shelter, doing double overtime. I get a little crazy, but I won't be denied. Gotta find the time that takes the inside outside. Tumbling, in a world of swirl. Rumbling, in a world of swirl. In a world of swirl. Everything's hazy, everything's a blur. Isn't it amazing? checking outta where we were. It's so unpredictable, at the end of my rope. Gotta skate the ledge outta this kaleidoscope. Tumbling, in a world of swirl. Rumbling, in a world of swirl. In a world of swirl. In this cloud of dust, you've got to keep steady. Hang on you must, you better get ready. Over the ledge, ripping the curl. Riding the edge off into to twirl. Tumbling, in a world of swirl. Rumbling, in a world of swirl. In a world of swirl."

Just pull the old switch-a-roo. He/she done got a brand-new glistening zipper job. Oh yes, a zipper job. Flip, strip, zip, trip a talon-42. Timing is everything. For kings, queens, and in-betweens.
