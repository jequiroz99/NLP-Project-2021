17,"Seventeen, seventeen. Seventeen, seventeen. He was working at the record shop. I would kiss him in the parking lot. Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop. Seventeen. He would tell me I was beautiful. Sneaking in the neighbors' swimming pool. Yeah he taught me how to break the rules. Seventeen. Hey, these days are long gone. And when I hear this song. It takes me back. We were on top of the world. Back when I was your girl. We were living so wild and free. Acting stupid for fun. All we needed was love. That's the way it's supposed to be. Seventeen. Stealing beers out of the trailer park. Flicking lighters just to fight the dark. My favorite place was sitting in his car. Seventeen. Laid a blanket on the roof top. That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop. The nights were cold, but we kept them hot. Seventeen. Hey, these days are long gone. And when I hear this song. It takes me back. We were on top of the world. Back when I was your girl. We were living so wild and free. Acting stupid for fun. All we needed was love. That's the way it's supposed to be. We were running red lights. We were going all night. Didn't care about anything. It was you and me. We were living our dream. And we were seventeen. Oh oh oh oh oh oh (seventeen). Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh (seventeen).

23 april 2003 kathy's song,"When I heard that you died. I was stabbled inside. I'll never be the same again. I've lost a stranger yet I somehow lost a friend. Even though I never knew you. From the moment I heard I knew. So shorty was the passage between life and death. That I needed to some time to take a breath. So young girl this song's for you. And your life lost, so young, so new. And you never realized. That so many would lose their sleep tonight. Chorus:. So don't tell me. Not to cry. Cuz I'm hurting. Inside, outside. Young girl, you're to young to die. I heard your amibition's high. Now look me in the eye. And tell me that I shouldn't cry. I was there from the start. When I heard, I gave my heart. I can't connected how I feel. With what happened,or what's real. You felt the fear and then the blow. You couldn't say goodbye before you go. I can't sweep aside what I feel. I can't sweep aside it's so real. The cruel world let you die. So why do I feel like I shouldn't cry. I was shocked up inside. The day that you died. Chorus. I'm feeling like I've got no right. When there's others who won't sleep for nights. I'm feeling like I'm daft to feel this way. But I can't hold it back another day. These tears, this song's for you. There's nothing I wouldn't do. To let you know I care. But I stab to my heart unprepared. Left me feeling outta life. The day that you died. Chorus x2. Everytime I read those words. My heart gives in. I'll never get over it. It won't kick in. That you're gone. I'm sorry that you're gone. Dedicated to Kathy. 23 April 2003. Harriet if you read this I'm sorry"

The earth is moving,. I feel it under my feet,. And I'm still proving,. That I can stand my ground,. And my feet are there, haven't washed my hair. To be lost before you are found,. Don't mean you are losing. I'm falling down,. I'm falling down..I'm falling down.... I'm falling..."

When you turn off the lights. I get stars in my eyes. Is this love?. Maybe someday. I've got the scene in my head. I'm not sure how it ends. Is it love?. Maybe one day. So don't turn on the lights. I'll give you what you like. I'll give you one last chance to hold me. If you give me one last cigarette. By now it's early in the morning. Now that I gave you what you want. All I want is to forget. When you turn off the lights. I get stars in my eyes. Is this love?. Maybe someday. I've got the scene in my head. I'm not sure how it ends. Is it love?. Maybe one day. So don't turn on the lights. I'll give you what you like"

head above water,I've gotta keep the calm before the storm. I don't want less. I don't want more. Must bar the windows and the doors. To keep me safe to keep me warm. Yeah my life is what I'm fighting for. Can't part the sea. Can't reach the shore. And my voice becomes the driving force. I won't let this pull me overboard. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. So pull me up from down below. ‘Cause I'm underneath the undertow. Come dry me off and hold me close. I need you now I need you most. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Keep my head above water above water. And I can't see in the stormy weather. I can't seem to keep it all together. And I can't swim the ocean like this forever. And I can't breathe. God keep my head above water. I lose my breath at the bottom. Come rescue me. I'll be waiting. I'm too young to fall asleep. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Keep my head above water above water
headset,"See I got a little bit of a problem. Back where I come from,. Feels like five people in my population. And no one ever leaves there. I'm gonna be the first one. 'cause my papa always told me the way it was,. And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't. (ah ah ah). Chorus. But I've got my head set on california. I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya. And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off. I've got my head set on California. See, I got what you would call an obsession. It feels like i think sane. The limits of a small town. Frustrating my brain,. Might leave some roots there,. But my head's on the next plane. 'cause my daddy always told me the way it was,. And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't. (ah ah ah). Chorus. But I've got my head set on california. I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya. And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off. I've got my head set on California. Papa always told me the way it was,. And my mama think she knows me, i know she doesn't. But I've got my head set on new york city. I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even miss me. And I'll get a big boyfriend, just to piss you off. Chorus. But I've got my head set on california. I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya. And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off. I've got my head set on California. Here I come, here I come"

my world,"Please tell me what is taking place,. Cause I can't seem to find a trace,. Guess it must have got erased somehow,. Probablly cause I always forget,. Everytime someone tells me their name,. It's always gotta be the same.. Never wore cover up,. Always beat the boys up,. Grew up in a 5000 population town,. Made my money by cutting grass,. Got fired by fried chicken ass!. All in a small town, Napanee. You know I always stay up without sleeping,. And think to myself,. Where do I belong forever,. In whose arms, the time and place?. Can't help it if I space in a daze,. My eyes tune out the other way,. I may switch off and go in a day dream,. In this head my thoughts are deep,. But sometimes I can't even speak,. Would someone be and not pretend. I'm off again in my World. I never spend less than an hour,. Washin' my hair in the shower,. It always takes 5 hours to make it straight,. So I'll braid it in a zillion braids,. Though it may take a friggen day,. There's nothing else better to do anyway. When you're all alone in the lands of forever,. Lay under the milkyway,. On and on it's getting too late out,. I'm not in love this time, this night.. Can't help if I space in a daze,. My eyes tune out the other way,. I may switch off and go in a daydream,. In this head my thoughts are deep,. But sometimes I can't even speak,. Would someone be and not pretend. I'm off again in my World. (la la la la). Take some time,. Mellow out,. Party up,. I don't fall down,. Don't get caught,. Sneak out of the house.. Can't help if I space in a daze,. My eyes tune out the other way,. I may switch off and go in a daydream,. In this head my thoughts are deep,. But sometimes I can't even speak,. Would someone be and not pretend. I'm off again in my World. Can't help if I space in a daze,. My eyes tune out the other way,. I may switch off and go in a daydream,. In this head my thoughts are deep,. But sometimes I can't even speak,. Would someone be and not pretend. I'm off again in my World"

o holy night (feat. chantal kreviazuk),"O holy night,. The stars are brightly shining;. It is the night of. Our dear savior's birth!. Long lay the world. In sin and error pining,. Till he appeared. And the soul felt its worth.. A thrill of hope,. The weary world rejoices,. For yonder breaks. A new and glorious morn.. Fall on your knees,. O hear the angel voices!. O night divine,. O night when christ was born!. O night divine, o night,. O night divine!. Truly he taught us. To love one another;. His law is love and. His gospel is peace.. Chains shall he break. For the slave is our brother. And in his name. All oppression shall cease.. Sweet hymns of joy in. Grateful chorus raise we,. Let all within us. Praise his holy name!. Christ is the king. Then already already praises we. His power and glory evermore proclaim. His power and glory. Evermore proclaim"

touch the sky (stephen medd feat. avril),"I used to carry this big old world. On my shoulders and back. I used to lie inside my room. Wondering where I'm at. I felt a chill running through my veins. And wondered, would I be saved?. I felt the ice building in my soul. Would it melt away?. He's a warm breeze. Breathing life into me. He's the sunlight. Shining down on me. I used to worry my life away. Counting every dime. Shutting out the ones I loved. Never finding the time. And then one day I was overcome. By loneliness and dispair. And deep inside I thought I heard. ""Lean on me, I'm here"". He's a warm breeze. Breathing life into me. He's the sunlight. Shining down on me. I pulled the burden from off my back. And tossed it into the wind. And stretched my arms toward the sky. And let my life begin. And like a tree, I have measured up. Best when I've been cut down. And like a tree, I can touch the sky. With my feet on the ground. He's a warm breeze. Breathing life into me. He's the sunlight. Shining down on me. He's a warm breeze. Breathing life into me. He's the sunlight. Shining down on me, yeah. Shining down on me. Shining down, shining down. Shining down on me"

Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown.

I'm too young to fall asleep. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown.

17,"Seventeen, seventeen. Seventeen, seventeen. He was working at the record shop. I would kiss him in the parking lot. Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop. Seventeen. He would tell me I was beautiful. Sneaking in the neighbors' swimming pool. Yeah he taught me how to break the rules. Seventeen. Hey, these days are long gone. And when I hear this song. It takes me back. We were on top of the world. Back when I was your girl. We were living so wild and free. Acting stupid for fun. All we needed was love. That's the way it's supposed to be. Seventeen. Stealing beers out of the trailer park. Flicking lighters just to fight the dark. My favorite place was sitting in his car. Seventeen. Laid a blanket on the roof top. That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop. The nights were cold, but we kept them hot. Seventeen. Hey, these days are long gone. And when I hear this song. It takes me back. We were on top of the world. Back when I was your girl. We were living so wild and free. Acting stupid for fun. All we needed was love. That's the way it's supposed to be. We were running red lights. We were going all night. Didn't care about anything. It was you and me. We were living our dream. And we were seventeen. Oh oh oh oh oh oh (seventeen). Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh (seventeen).

23 april 2003 kathy's song,"When I heard that you died. I was stabbled inside. I'll never be the same again. I've lost a stranger yet I somehow lost a friend. Even though I never knew you. From the moment I heard I knew. So shorty was the passage between life and death. That I needed to some time to take a breath. So young girl this song's for you. And your life lost, so young, so new. And you never realized. That so many would lose their sleep tonight. Chorus:. So don't tell me. Not to cry. Cuz I'm hurting. Inside, outside. Young girl, you're to young to die. I heard your amibition's high. Now look me in the eye. And tell me that I shouldn't cry. I was there from the start. When I heard, I gave my heart. I can't connected how I feel. With what happened,or what's real. You felt the fear and then the blow. You couldn't say goodbye before you go. I can't sweep aside what I feel. I can't sweep aside it's so real. The cruel world let you die. So why do I feel like I shouldn't cry. I was shocked up inside. The day that you died. Chorus. I'm feeling like I've got no right. When there's others who won't sleep for nights. I'm feeling like I'm daft to feel this way. But I can't hold it back another day. These tears, this song's for you. There's nothing I wouldn't do. To let you know I care. But I stab to my heart unprepared. Left me feeling outta life. The day that you died. Chorus x2. Everytime I read those words. My heart gives in. I'll never get over it. It won't kick in. That you're gone. I'm sorry that you're gone. Dedicated to Kathy. 23 April 2003. Harriet if you read this I'm sorry"

To analyze my dreams. She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down. I went to a whore. She said my life's a bore. And quit my whining cause it's bringing her down. Sometimes I give myself the creeps. Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. It all keeps adding up. I think I'm cracking up. Am I just paranoid?. I'm just stoned. Grasping to control.

But, when I tried to speak out. Felt like no one could hear me. Wanted to belong here. But something felt so wrong here. So I'd pray. I could break away.

But, I won't forget all the ones that I love. I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Wanna feel the warm breeze. Sleep under a palm tree. Feel the rush of the ocean. Get onboard a fast train. Travel on a jetplane, far away. And break away. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky. And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Out of the darkness and into the sun. I won't forget all the ones that I love. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Buildings with a hundred floors. Swinging round revolving doors. Maybe I don't know where they'll take me. But, gotta keep moving on, moving on. Fly away, break away. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta. Take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Out of the darkness and into the sun. But, I won't forget the place I come from. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And break away. Break away. Break away"

When you turn off the lights. I get stars in my eyes. Is this love?. Maybe someday. I've got the scene in my head. I'm not sure how it ends. Is it love?. Maybe one day. So don't turn on the lights. I'll give you what you like. I'll give you one last chance to hold me. If you give me one last cigarette. By now it's early in the morning. Now that I gave you what you want. All I want is to forget. When you turn off the lights. I get stars in my eyes. Is this love?. Maybe someday. I've got the scene in my head. I'm not sure how it ends. Is it love?. Maybe one day. So don't turn on the lights. I'll give you what you like"

head above water,I've gotta keep the calm before the storm. I don't want less. I don't want more. Must bar the windows and the doors. To keep me safe to keep me warm. Yeah my life is what I'm fighting for. Can't part the sea. Can't reach the shore. And my voice becomes the driving force. I won't let this pull me overboard. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. So pull me up from down below. ‘Cause I'm underneath the undertow. Come dry me off and hold me close. I need you now I need you most. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Keep my head above water above water. And I can't see in the stormy weather. I can't seem to keep it all together. And I can't swim the ocean like this forever. And I can't breathe. God keep my head above water. I lose my breath at the bottom. Come rescue me. I'll be waiting. I'm too young to fall asleep. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Keep my head above water above water

All in a small town, Napanee. You know I always stay up without sleeping,. And think to myself,. Where do I belong forever,. In whose arms, the time and place?. Can't help it if I space in a daze,. My eyes tune out the other way,. I may switch off and go in a day dream,. In this head my thoughts are deep,. But sometimes I can't even speak,. Would someone be and not pretend. I'm off again in my World. I never spend less than an hour,. Washin' my hair in the shower,. It always takes 5 hours to make it straight,. So I'll braid it in a zillion braids,. Though it may take a friggen day,. There's nothing else better to do anyway. When you're all alone in the lands of forever,. Lay under the milkyway,. On and on it's getting too late out,. I'm not in love this time, this night.. Can't help if I space in a daze,. My eyes tune out the other way,. I may switch off and go in a daydream,. In this head my thoughts are deep,.

o holy night (feat. chantal kreviazuk),"O holy night,. The stars are brightly shining;. It is the night of. Our dear savior's birth!. Long lay the world. In sin and error pining,. Till he appeared. And the soul felt its worth.. A thrill of hope,. The weary world rejoices,. For yonder breaks. A new and glorious morn.. Fall on your knees,. O hear the angel voices!. O night divine,. O night when christ was born!. O night divine, o night,. O night divine!. Truly he taught us. To love one another;. His law is love and. His gospel is peace.. Chains shall he break. For the slave is our brother. And in his name. All oppression shall cease.. Sweet hymns of joy in. Grateful chorus raise we,. Let all within us. Praise his holy name!. Christ is the king. Then already already praises we. His power and glory evermore proclaim. His power and glory. Evermore proclaim"
