memories,"My day has gone. The night is bringing. Memories of past. Memories of you. Don't think that I've forgotten you. I'm right here. Sleepless and cold. It's 4:10. Only 4:10 at dawn. It's all right. I'm drinking a coffee. I get up. Open the window. And I scream out loud, loudly. Wherever you are. I will be. Hoping that you will. Be waiting for me. And you must be sure. I'm really your friend. Forever your friend. I'm very glad. It's only midday. Of a rainy weekend. I was in bed. But I woke up. Put on some pants. I pack my bags. Grab my old guitar. Look, I'm right behind you. Where you are. I will be. Hoping that you will be waiting for me. And you must be sure. I'm really your friend. Forever your friend. I'm so glad. Then I realized. That the peace I didn't have. Was here inside. And I was lost in a castle of illusions. And with my mind clear. I'm coming back home. Because today I live. 'Cause where you are. I will be. Hoping that you will be waiting for me. And you must be sure. I'm really your friend. Forever friend. I'm very glad. Yeah, there was a castle of illusion. In a castle of illusion"
no matter what,"You could give me a broad smile. And there is nothing else to add. Today I live without emptiness. Now everything has sense. If my patience far away goes. I can hear 'Stay a little longer'. The deep eco that your voice makes. Gives more reasons to be, so well. Everything I have. To you I give, no matter what. Everything you have. I want to be mine. No matter what. And this way I live happily. I have only changed the way I see. And this little has become a lot to me. I can't never forget, I can't. Where I came from and who I am. It's that I returned. I learned on the road the price that I paid. For everything not lived"
open your eyes,"All this feels strange and untrue. And I won't waste a minute without you. My bones ache, my skin feels cold. And I'm getting so tired and so old. The anger swells in my guts. And I won't feel these slices and cuts. I want so much to open your eyes. 'Cause I need you to look into mine. Tell me that you'll open your eyes x4. Get up, get out, get away from these liars. 'Cause they don't get your soul or your fire. Take my hand, knot your fingers through mine. And we'll walk from this dark room for the last time. Every minute from this minute now. We can do what we like anywhere. I want so much to open your eyes. 'Cause I need you to look into mine. Tell me that you'll open your eyes x8. All this feels strange and untrue. And I won't waste a minute without you"
without you,"All my life, all my history. Just made sense when I met you. Your eyes, your face. Just take me beyond what I thought. If I sometimes hide on you I find myself. I can't even pretend. I need to say: I miss you, you. There's no way to explain. It was without you that I understood. That is not easy to live without you. My broken heart says that I can not. I can not live never more without you. Without you. All my life, all my history. Just made some sense when I met you. Your eyes, oh, your holy face. Just take me beyond what I thought. If I sometimes hide on you I find myself. I can't even pretend. I need to say: I miss you, you. There's no way to explain. It was without you that I understood. That is not easy to live without you. My broken heart says that I can not. I can not live never more without you. Without you. Never without you. Without you. Without you. I am nothing without you. Without you"
