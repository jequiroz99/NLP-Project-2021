sultans of swing,"You get a shiver in the dark. It's raining in the park but meantime. South of the river you stop and you hold everything. A band is blowing Dixie double four time. You feel alright when you hear that music ring. Well now, you step inside. but you don't see too many faces. Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down. Competition in other places. But the horns be blowing that sound. Way on downsouth way on downsouth london town. You check out guitar George he knows all the chords. Mind he's strictly rhythm. He doesn't want to make it cry or sing. And an old guitar is all he can afford. When he gets up under lights to play his thing. And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene. He's got a daytime job he's doing alright. He can play honky tonk like anything. Saving it up for friday night. With the sultans... with the sultans of swing. And a crowd of young boys. They're fooling around in the corner. Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies. And their platform soles. They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band. It ain't what they call rock and roll. And the sultans... yea the sultans played creole... creole. Then the man he steps right up to the microphone. And says at last just as the time bell rings. 'goodnight, now it's time to go home'. And he makes it fast with one more thing. 'we are the sultans... we are the sultans of swing'"

brothers in arms,These mist covered mountains. Are a home now for me. But my home is the lowlands. And always will be. Some day you'll return to. Your valleys and your farms. And you'll no longer burn. To be brothers in arms. Through these fields of destruction. Baptism of fire. I've witnessed your suffering. As the battles raged higher. And though they did hurt me so bad. In the fear and alarm. You did not desert me. My brothers in arms. There's so many different worlds. So many different suns. And we have just one world. But we live in different ones. Now the sun's gone to hell. And the moon's riding high. Let me bid you farewell. Every man has to die. But it's written in the starlight. And every line on your palm. We're fools to make war. On our brothers in arms

your latest trick,"All the late night bargains have been struck. Between the southern beaus and their belles. And prehistoric garbage trucks. Have the city to themselves. Echoes and roars of dinosaurs. They're all doing the monster mash. And most of the taxis, most of the whores. Are only taking calls for cash. I don't know how it happened. It all took place so quick. But all I can do is hand it to you. And your latest trick. My door was standing open. Security was laid back and lax. But it was only my heart got broken. You must have had a pass key made out of wax. You played robbery with insolence. And I played the blues on twelve bars. down on Lover's Lane. And you never did have the intellegence to use. The twelve keys hanging off my chain. I don't know how it happened. It all took place so quick. But all I can do is hand it to you. And your latest trick. Now it's past last call for alcohol. Last drinker has been here and gone. The landlord finally paid us off. Seven tenners made us put away them horns. And we're standing outside of this wonderland. Looking so bereaved and so bereft. Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands. The bottle's empty and there's nothing left. I don't know how it happened. It was faster than the eye could flick. But all I can do is hand it to you. And your latest trick"

Says something like, 'You and me babe, how about it?'. Juliet says, 'Hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack'. He's underneath the window, she's singing, 'Hey la, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here, singing up to people like that'. Anyway, what you gonna do about it?. Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start,. And I bet, then you exploded into my heart,. And I forget, I forget, the movie song. When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?. Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame,.

When you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold. You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold. You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah. Now you just say, 'Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him. Juliet, when we made love you used to cry. You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die. There's a place for us, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?. I can't do the talks, like they talk on the TV. And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you.

why worry,"Baby I see this world has made you sad. Some people can be bad. The things they do, the things they say. But baby I'll wipe away those bitter tears. I'll chase away those restless fears.

love over gold,You walk out on the high wire. You're a dancer on thin ice. You pay no heed to the danger. And less to advice. Your footsteps are forbidden. But with knowledge of your sin. You throw your love to all the strangers. And caution to the wind. And you go dancing through doorways. Just to see what you will find. Leaving nothing to interfere. With the crazy balance of your mind. And when you finally reappear. At the place where you came in. You've thrown your love to all the strangers. And caution to the wind. It takes lover over gold. And mind over matter. To do what you do that you must. When the things that you hold. Can fall and be shattered. Or run through your fingers like dust.

Scarred for life ... nocompensation. private investigations.

The pleasure and the pain. Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete. And it's your face I'm looking for on every street. A ladykiller - regulation tattoo. Silver spurs on his heels. Says - what can I tell you, as I'm standing next to you. She threw herself under my wheels. Oh it's a dangerous road. And a hazardous load. And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat. And it's your face I'm looking for on every street. A three-chord symphony crashes into space. The moon is hanging upside down. I don't know why it is I'm still on the case. It's a ravenous town. And you still refuse to be traced. Seems to me such a waste. And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet. And it's your face I'm looking for on every street"

down to the waterline,"Sweet surrender on the quayside. You remember we used to run and hide. In the shadow of the cargoes I take you one time. And we're counting all the numbers down to the waterline. Near misses on the dogleap stairways. French kisses in the darkened doorways. A foghorn blowing out wild and cold. A policeman shines a light upon my shoulder. Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the night. Over my shoulder all you can see are the pilot lights. No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn. Your hands are cold but your lips are warm. She can see him on the jetty where they used to go. She can feel him in the places where the sailors go. When she's walking by the river and the railway line. She can still hear him whisper. ""Let's go down to the waterline"""

I've been too long lonely and my heart feels pain. Crying out for some soothing rain. I believe I have taken enough. Yes, I need a little water of love. Water of love deep in the ground. No water here to be found. Some day baby when the river runs free. It'll carry that water of love to me. There's a bird up in tree sitting up high. Waiting for me to die. If I don't get some water soon. I'll be dead and gone in the afternoon. Once I had a woman I could call my own. Once I had a woman now woman is gone. Once there was a river now there's a stone. You know it's evil when you're living alone"

iron hand,"With all the clarity of dream. The sky so blue, the grass so green. The rank and file and the navy blue. The deep and strong, the straight and true. The blue line they got the given sign. The belts and boots march forward in time. The wood and leather the club and shield. Swept like a wave across the battlefield. Now with all the clarity of dream. The blood so red, the grass so green. The gleam of spur on chestnut flank. The cavalry did burst upon the ranks. Oh the iron will and iron hand. In England's green and pleasant land. No music for the shameful scene. That night they said it had even shocked the queen. Well alas we've seen it all before. Knights in armour, days of yore. The same old fears and the same old crimes. We haven't changed since ancient times."

brothers in arms,These mist covered mountains. Are a home now for me. But my home is the lowlands. And always will be. Some day you'll return to. Your valleys and your farms. And you'll no longer burn. To be brothers in arms. Through these fields of destruction. Baptism of fire. I've witnessed your suffering. As the battles raged higher. And though they did hurt me so bad. In the fear and alarm. You did not desert me. My brothers in arms. There's so many different worlds. So many different suns. And we have just one world. But we live in different ones. Now the sun's gone to hell. And the moon's riding high. Let me bid you farewell. Every man has to die. But it's written in the starlight. And every line on your palm. We're fools to make war. On our brothers in arms

down to the waterline,"Sweet surrender on the quayside. You remember we used to run and hide. In the shadow of the cargoes I take you one time. And we're counting all the numbers down to the waterline. Near misses on the dogleap stairways. French kisses in the darkened doorways. A foghorn blowing out wild and cold. A policeman shines a light upon my shoulder. Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the night. Over my shoulder all you can see are the pilot lights. No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn. Your hands are cold but your lips are warm. She can see him on the jetty where they used to go. She can feel him in the places where the sailors go. When she's walking by the river and the railway line. She can still hear him whisper. ""Let's go down to the waterline"""

I was made to go with my girl. Like a saxophone was made to go with the night. And she can raise one eyebrow. Put her hand on my hip. And I close one eye now. Sweat on her lip. And I surrender to the fever. I surrender to the will of the night. She love me so tender I got to believe her. Love ? Expresso love's alright. I don't want no sugar in it. Thank you very much. All wired up on it all fired up on it. Expresso touch. Hey maestro expresso. It's just another one just like the other one. Hey maestro expresso. Is this another one just like the other one.
fade to black,I wonder where you are tonight. You're probably on the rampage somewhere. You have been known to take delight. In gettin' in somebody's hair. And you always had the knack. Fade to black. I bet you already made a pass. I see a darkened room somewhere. You run your finger round the rim of his glass. Run your fingers through his hair. They scratch across his back. Fade to black. Well maybe it's all for the best. But I wish I'd never been lassoed. Maybe it's some kind of test. I wish I'd never been tattooed. Or been to hell and back. Fade to black

Rain come down forgive this dirty town. Rain come down and give this dirty town. A drink of water a drink of wine. If I been hard on you I never chose to be. I never wanted no one else. I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to. Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to. As you'd sleep I'd think my heart would break in two. I'd kiss your cheek I'd stop myself from waking you.

Yes and if my love's in vain how come my love is so strong ?. Now you and me go parallel together and apart. And you keep your perfect distance and it's tearing at my heart. Did you never feel the distance. You never tried to cross no line. Now it's another dirty river and another dirty scar. And I don't know who's kissing you and I don't know where you are. So far from home don't you thing of me sometime. Sky is crying see the streets are full of tears. Rain coming down to wash away my fears. And all this writing on the wall. Oh I can read between the lines.

Yes, if you wanna run cool, you got to run. On heavy, heavy fuel"

in the gallery,Harry made a bareback rider proud and free upon a horse. And a fine coalminer for the NCB that was. A fallen angel and Jesus on the cross. A skating ballerina you should have seen her do the skater's waltz. Some people have got to paint and draw. Harry had to work in clay and stone. Like the waves coming to the shore. It was in his blood and in his bones. Ignored by all the trendy boys in London and in Leeds. He might as well have been making toys or strings of beads. He could not be in the gallery. And then you get an artist says he doesn't want to paint at all. He takes an empty canvas and sticks it on the wall. The birds of a feather all the phonies and all of the fakes. While the dealers they get together. And they decide who gets the breaks. And who's going to be in the gallery. No lies he wouldn't compromise. No junk no bits of string. And all the lies we subsidise. That just don't mean a thing. I've got to say he passed away in obscurity. And now all the vultures are coming down from the tree. So he's going to be the gallery.
industrial disease,"Warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control. Somebody threw a spanner and they threw him in the hole. There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town. Somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down. There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell. There's leaking in the washroom there's sneak in personnel. Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze. 'Gooness me could this be Industrial Disease ?'. The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post. They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most. The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got the fleas. And everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease. There's panic on the swichboard tongues are ties in knots. Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots. Some blame the management some the employees. And everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease. The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks. Innocence is injured experience just talks. Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees. That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'. On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse. Philosophy is useless; theology is worse. History boils over there's an economics freeze. Sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'. Doctor Parkinson declared 'I'm not surprised to see you here. You've got smokers cough from smoking brewer's droop from drinking beer. I don't know how you came to get the Bette Davis knees. But worst of all young man you've got Industrial Disease'. He wrote me a prescription he said 'you are depressed. But I'm glad came came to see me to get this off your chest. Come back and see me later - next patient please. Send in another victim of Industrial Disease'. I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck. They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks. Two men say they're Jesus, one of them must be wrong. There's a protest singer singing a protest song - he says. 'They wanna have a war to keep their factories. They wanna have a war to keep us on our knees. They wanna have a war to stop us buying Japanese. They wanna have a war to stop Industrial Disease. They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind. They wanna sap your energy incarcerate your mind. They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three. Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'. Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'll cure it soon. Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'. The other one's out on hunger striker he's dying by degrees. How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease?."
iron hand,"With all the clarity of dream. The sky so blue, the grass so green. The rank and file and the navy blue. The deep and strong, the straight and true. The blue line they got the given sign. The belts and boots march forward in time. The wood and leather the club and shield. Swept like a wave across the battlefield. Now with all the clarity of dream. The blood so red, the grass so green. The gleam of spur on chestnut flank. The cavalry did burst upon the ranks. Oh the iron will and iron hand. In England's green and pleasant land. No music for the shameful scene. That night they said it had even shocked the queen. Well alas we've seen it all before. Knights in armour, days of yore. The same old fears and the same old crimes. We haven't changed since ancient times."
it never rains,I hear the Seven Deadly Sins. And the Terrible Twins came to call on you. The bigger they are babe. The harder they fall on you. And you you're always the same you persevere. On the same old pleasure ground. Oh and it never rains around here. It just comes pouring down. You had no more volunteers. So you got profiteers for to help you out. With friends like that babe. Good friends you had to do without. And now they're taken the chains and the gears. From off your merry-go-round. Oh and it never rains around here. It just comes pouring down. And your new Romeo. Was just a gigolo when he let you down. See the faster they are babe. The faster they get out of town. Leaving make up stains and the tears. Of a clown. Yes and it never rains around here. It just comes pouring down. Oh you were just a roller coaster memory. I don't know why I was even passing through. I saw you making a date with Destiny. When he came around here asking after you. In the shadow of the Wheel Of Fortune. You're busy trying to clear your name. You say ' I may be guilty yeah that may be true. But I'd be lying if I said I was to blame. See we could have been major contenders. We never got no money no breaks '. You're got a list of all the major offenders. You got a list of all their major mistakes. And he's just standing in the shadows. Yes and you smile that come-on smile. Oh I can still hear you say as clear as the day. ' I'd like to make it worth your while '. Ah but it's sad reminder. When your organ grinder has to come to you for rent. And all you've got to give him. Is the use of your side-show tent. Yes and that's all that remains of the years. Spent doing the rounds. And I never never rains around here. Well it just comes pouring down. Now you know what they say about beggars. You can't complain about the rules. You know what they are about beggars. You know who's the first to blame his tools. You never gave a damn about who you pick up. And leave laying bleeding on the ground. You screw people over on the way up. Because you thought that you were never coming down. And he takes you out in Vaudeville Valley. With his hand up smothering your screams. And he screws you down in Tin Pan Alley. In the city of a billion dreams

lions,Red sun go down way over dirty town. Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals. A girl is there high heeling across the square. Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles. Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light. She looks around to find a face she can like. Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong. Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays. They're all in the station praying for trains. Congregation late again. It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days. Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright. He's crazy lion howling for a fight. Strap hanging gunshot sound. Doors slamming on the overground. Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone. Her evening paper is horror torn. But there's hope later for Capricorns. Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home. Then she's reading about a swing to the right. But she's thinking about a stranger in the night. I'm thinking about the lions tonight. What happened to the lions.
love over gold,You walk out on the high wire. You're a dancer on thin ice. You pay no heed to the danger. And less to advice. Your footsteps are forbidden. But with knowledge of your sin. You throw your love to all the strangers. And caution to the wind. And you go dancing through doorways. Just to see what you will find. Leaving nothing to interfere. With the crazy balance of your mind. And when you finally reappear. At the place where you came in. You've thrown your love to all the strangers. And caution to the wind. It takes lover over gold. And mind over matter. To do what you do that you must. When the things that you hold. Can fall and be shattered. Or run through your fingers like dust.

But the horns be blowing that sound. Way on downsouth way on downsouth london town. You check out guitar George he knows all the chords. Mind he's strictly rhythm. He doesn't want to make it cry or sing. And an old guitar is all he can afford. When he gets up under lights to play his thing. And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene. He's got a daytime job he's doing alright. He can play honky tonk like anything. Saving it up for friday night. With the sultans... with the sultans of swing. And a crowd of young boys. They're fooling around in the corner. Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies. And their platform soles. They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band. It ain't what they call rock and roll. And the sultans... yea the sultans played creole... creole. Then the man he steps right up to the microphone. And says at last just as the time bell rings.

Here come Johnny with the power and the glory. Backbeat, the talkin' blues. He got the action, he got the motion. Yeah, the boy can play. Dedication devotion. Turning all the night time into the day. He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman. He do the song about the knife. And he do the walk, he do the walk of life. Yeah, he do the walk of life. Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies. Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say. Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman. Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay. He got the action, he got the motion. Oh yeah, the boy can play. Dedication devotion. Turning all the night time into the day. And after all the violence and double talk. There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife. You do the walk, you do the walk of life. Hm, you do the walk of life"
water of love,"High and dry in the long hot day. Lost and lonely every way. Got the flats all around me sky up above. Yes, I need a little water of love. I've been too long lonely and my heart feels pain. Crying out for some soothing rain. I believe I have taken enough. Yes, I need a little water of love. Water of love deep in the ground. No water here to be found. Some day baby when the river runs free. It'll carry that water of love to me. There's a bird up in tree sitting up high. Waiting for me to die. If I don't get some water soon. I'll be dead and gone in the afternoon. Once I had a woman I could call my own. Once I had a woman now woman is gone. Once there was a river now there's a stone. You know it's evil when you're living alone"
what it is,"The drinking dens are spilling out. There's staggering in the square. There's lads and lasses falling about. And a crackling in the air. Down around the dungeon doors. The shelters and the queues. Everybody's looking for. Somebody's arms to fall into. And it's what it is. It's what it is now. There's frost on the graves and the monuments. But the taverns are warm in town. People Curse the government. And shovel hot food down. The lights are out in the city hall. The castle and the keep. The moon shines down upon it all. The legless and asleep. And it's cold on the tollgate. With the wagons creeping through. Cold on the tollgate. God knows what I could do with you. And it's what it is. It's what it is now. The garrison sleeps in the citadel. With the ghosts and the ancient stones. High up on the parapet. A Scottish piper stands alone. And high on the wind. The highland drums begin to roll. And something from the past just comes. And stares into my soul. And it's cold on the tollgate. With the Caledonian Blues. Cold on the tollgate. God knows what I could do with you. And it's what it is. It's what it is now. What it is. It's what it is now. There's a chink of light, there's a burning wick. There's a lantern in the tower. Wee Willie Winkie with a candlestick. Still writing songs in the wee wee hours. On Charlotte Street I take. A walking stick from my hotel. The ghost of Dirty Dick. Is still in search of Little Nell. And it's what it is. It's what it is now. Oh what it is. What it is now. (by: UUalmerson)"
what's the matter baby?,There's a shadow hanging over the valley. A total eclipse of the moon. Closing up the gates of the city. The wind it plays a wild tune. Don't you put a lock on your window. Don't you put the bar on your door. Don't you cry for the rain in the sky. You've seen the storm before. . Yea now what's the matter with you baby. Baby what's the matter now. What's the matter your running in the shadows. Everytime you hear the wild man yell. Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby. Baby what's the matter now.

Don't you flinch don't give a inch. Just a let the flood come down. . Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby. Baby what's the matter now. What's the matter your running in the shadows. Everytime you hear the wild man yell. Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby. Baby what's the matter now. What's the matter your running in the shadows. Everytime you here the wildman yell
when it comes to you,"If we can't get along we oughtta be apart. And I'm wondering where'd you get that cold, cold heart. Set me free - sign my release. I'm tired of being the villain of the piece. You been givin' me a bad time. Tell me what'd I do. How come I always get a hard time. Honey when it comes to you. Sayin' things that you didn't have to. How come I always get a hard time.

I think a you don't know. You got no way of knowing. There's really no place you can go. I understand your changes. A-long before you reach the door. I know where you think you're going.

But you still find cause to doubt me. If you ain't with me girl. You're gonna be without me. Where d'ya think you're going. Don't you know it's dark outside. Where d'ya think you're going. I wish I didn't care about my pride. And now I'm sick of joking. You know I like you to be free. A-where d'ya think ya going. I think you better go with me girl.
why aye man,"We had no way of staying afloat. We had to leave on the ferry boat. Economic refugees. On the run to Germany. We had the back of Maggie's hand. Times were tough in Geordieland. We got wor tools and working gear. And humped it all from Newcastle to here. Why aye man, why aye, why aye man. Why aye man, why aye, why aye man. We're the nomad tribes, travelling boys. In the dust and dirt and the racket and the noise. Drills and hammers, diggers and picks. Mixing concrete, laying bricks. There's English, Irish, Scots, the lot. United Nation's what we've got. Brickies, chippies, every trade. German building, british-made. Why aye man, why aye, why aye man. Why aye man, why aye, why aye man. Nae more work on Maggie's farm. Hadaway down the autobahn. Mine's a portacabin bed. Or a bunk in a nissen hut instead. There's plenty deutschmarks here to earn. And German tarts are wunderschön. German beer is chemical-free. Germany's alreet with me. Sometimes I miss my river Tyne. But you're my pretty fraulein. Tonight we'll drink the old town dry. Keep wor spirit levels high. Why aye man, why aye, why aye man. Why aye man, why aye, why aye man"
why worry,"Baby I see this world has made you sad. Some people can be bad. The things they do, the things they say. But baby I'll wipe away those bitter tears. I'll chase away those restless fears. That turn your blue skies into grey. Why worry, there should be laughter after pain. There should be sunshine after rain. These things have always been the same. So why worry now. Baby when I get down I turn to you. And you make sense of what I do. I know it isn't hard to say. But baby just when this world seems mean and cold. Our love comes shining red and gold. And all the rest is by the way. Why worry, there should be laughter after pain. There should be sunshine after rain. These things have always been the same. So why worry now"
wild west end,Stepping out to Angellucci's for my coffee beans. Checking out the movies and the magazines. Waitress she watches me crossing from the Barocco Bar. I'm getting a pickup for my steel guitar. I saw you walking out Shaftesbury Avenue. Excuse me talking I wanna marry you. This is seventh heaven street to me. Don't be so proud. You're just another angel in the crowd. And I'm walking in the wild west end. Walking with your wild best friend. And my conductress on the number nineteen. She was a homey. Pink toenails and hands all dirty with money. Greasy hair easy smile. Made me feel nineteen for a while. And I went down to Chinatown. In the backroom it's man's world. All the money go down. Duck inside the doorway gotta duck duck to eat. Right now fells alright now. You and me we can't beat. And a gogo dancing girl yes I saw her. The deejay he say here's Mandy for ya. I feel alright to see her. But she's paid to do that stuff. She's dancing high I move on by. The close ups can get rough. When you're walking in the wild west end.
you and your friend,Will you and your friend come around. Are you and your friend gonna get on down. Will you and your friend come around. Or are you and your friend gonna let me down. If you talk to one another. I'm a hungry man. Let me know one way or the other. So I can make my plans. Will you and your friend come around. Or are you and your friend gonna get on down. Will you and your friend come around. Or are you and your friend gonna get on down. I relive the situation. Still see it in my mind. You got my imagination. Working overtime.
your latest trick,"All the late night bargains have been struck. Between the southern beaus and their belles. And prehistoric garbage trucks. Have the city to themselves. Echoes and roars of dinosaurs. They're all doing the monster mash. And most of the taxis, most of the whores. Are only taking calls for cash. I don't know how it happened. It all took place so quick. But all I can do is hand it to you. And your latest trick. My door was standing open. Security was laid back and lax. But it was only my heart got broken. You must have had a pass key made out of wax. You played robbery with insolence. And I played the blues on twelve bars. down on Lover's Lane. And you never did have the intellegence to use. The twelve keys hanging off my chain. I don't know how it happened. It all took place so quick. But all I can do is hand it to you. And your latest trick. Now it's past last call for alcohol. Last drinker has been here and gone. The landlord finally paid us off. Seven tenners made us put away them horns. And we're standing outside of this wonderland. Looking so bereaved and so bereft. Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands. The bottle's empty and there's nothing left. I don't know how it happened. It was faster than the eye could flick. But all I can do is hand it to you. And your latest trick"
