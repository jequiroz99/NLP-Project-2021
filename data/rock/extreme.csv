Where there's smoke. There's fire. What you sow is what you will reap. Slippery when wet. Skating on thin ice. Caution falling rocks. Give a hoot don't pollute. Surgeon General's warning. Don't you drink and drive. Saying no to drugs. Hazardous to your health. Out of reach from children. Fatal if you swallow. Keep away from heat. Pull in case of fire. Rain dance Howthafukowee.

song for love,"I lie awake with open eyes. My love just died. I'm cold inside. Can't face the thought to be alone. All by myself on my own. Love's come and gone. I look around and see. The hearts that still are broken. I can't believe all of our hearts remain unopened. We can't go go on and on. With that same old song. So wipe off the frown. And turn around and face each other. Come on, come on. Let's sing a song. A song for you, a song for me, a song for love. All for one and one for all together. Singing a song for love. You and I are none without the other. Singing a song for love. You let the time pass by. Big boys don't cry. Believe that lie. A broken heart that never mends. Is this the end. Listen my friend. These walls of hate. That separate one from the other. Time to rebuild bridges of love. One to another. Come on, come on. Let's sing a song. A song for you, a song for me, a song for love. All for one and one for all together. Singing a song for love. You and I are none without the other. Singing a song for love."
