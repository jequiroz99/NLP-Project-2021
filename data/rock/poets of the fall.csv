cradled in love,"You had the blue note sapphire eyes, to back up all those gazes. To pierce my guard and to take my soul off to faraway places. Told me I'll never be alone, cos you're right there.

I kept the love you gave me alive, and now I carry it with me. I know it's just a tear drop from mother earth, but in it. I can hear a dolphin sing. Telling me I'll never be alone, I know you're right there. So with the fire still burning bright, I wanna gaze into your light. If I could see my fortune there,. you know how flames can hypnotize. Do I even dare to speak out your name. for fear it sounds like, like a lover. So don't cry for your love, cry tears of joy. Cos you're alive cradled in love. Don't cry for your love, cry tears of joy. Cos you're alive. Cradled in love"

false kings,"Getting lost singing their song. Caught up in all I've done. It's all I know, but not what I need. Cut by my love, cut till I bleed. So I want to run to your shelter tonight. Run to the shelter tonight. United in silent resistance. Of bowing to false kings. So let me run to your shelter tonight. Run from this meaningless pantomime.

children of the sun,"Parallel to life. There's a wisdom that seems out of reach. Like a figure of speech. In a maze of white lies. So elusive it's hard to recognize. With naivety's eyes. It's like running with a knife. The thought steals away with your peace. And high on that trapeze. You hold on to me. You hold on to me. And I'll be singing you. Songs of tomorrow. And then dawn will follow. And our sorrows all undone. When you're done with all the strife. When they echo the minds in the streets. You know your heart beats. A solitary call.

And I'll be singing you. Songs of tomorrow. And then dawn will follow. And our sorrows all undone. Yeah, I'll be singing you. Songs of tomorrow. And then dawn will follow. We are children of the sun.

moonlight kissed,I see shadow and light. Stroking the mist. And I hear voices take flight. And send out our wish. Of peaceful dreams on a night. Moonlight kissed. Tendrils of smoke lash the street. And shamelessly court. Disguised honey sweet. To cater all sorts. And hushed tones all agree. And the world distorts. Wishing on a speck of dust. In this crazy ocean of fate. An echo of a memory. And maybe just a little too late. Fingers of blue on the snow. Reaching to touch. The warm light still aglow. Across the porch. We watch the scene die untold. Outside our window. For my words are the salt of lust. On that ivory skin. Difficult to hear at all. Through the everyday din. What is this if not some witchcraft?. Wrapped up widdershins. To lead us all astray. Hook in mouth. On through such webs of lies. Truth's a distant star. In our eyes. Moonlight kissed. New day comes again. And it laughs in your face. Whispering secrets of pain. By all its names. What flame could burn out the stain. Of a life misplaced?. But summer's scent still lingers. In your hair. Despite the ache. There's magic everywhere. Out the window run rebellion. Rapt with all you find. For seeking something new. Play in the ponds like summer's wind. Dance with the trees melding with mist. Beyond their flower field like. You're moonlight kissed
the poet and the muse,Theres an old tale wrought. With mystery Town. The poet and his muse. And the magic lake. Which gave a life. To the words the poet used. Now the muse she was his happiness. And he rhymed about her grace. And told her stories of treasures. Deep beneath the blackened waves. Till in the stillness of one dawn. Still in its mystic crown. The muse she went down to the lake. And in the waves she drowned. And now to see your love set free. You will need the witches cabin key. Find the lady of the light gone mad with the night. Thats how you reshape destiny. The Poet came down to the lake. To call out to his dear. When there was no answer. He was overcome with fear. He searched in vain for his treasure lost. And too soon the night would fall. And only his own echo. Would wail back at his call. And when he swore to bring back his love. By the stories hed create. Nightmares shifted endlessly. In the darkness of the lake. And now to see your love set free. You will need the witches cabin key. Find the lady of the light still ravin in the night. Thats how you reshape destiny. In the dead of night she came to him. with darkness in her eyes. Wearing a mourning gown. Sweet words as her disguise. He took her in without a word. For he saw his grave mistake. And vowed them both to silence. Deep beneath the lake. Now if its real or just a dream. One mystery remains. For it is said. On moonless nights. they may still haunt this place. And now to see your love set free. You will need the witches cabin key. Find the lady of the light gone mad with the night. Thats how you reshape destiny. And now to see your love set free. You will need the witches cabin key. Find the lady of the light still ravin in the night. Thats how you reshape destiny. By: VaaL Silva
brighter than the sun,"I'm in way too deep like a poser. And falling for the dream's just. The ground getting closer. I guess it's how our lives get painted in scars.

I want you to touch me, just to know I still feel, oh. Like a miracle you change me, raise me. Brighter than the sun till I'm ready to be me. And your love is the reason, yeah. Like a miracle you wake me, make me. Brighter than the sun when it used to blind me. I know your love is the reason. Love never goes out of season. I got nothing to call a solution. Not a penny to my name, just riding the motion. Yet like a child I still reach for the stars. But if this darkened hole is my conclusion. And the mother of pearl world is just a notion. I lose for playing out my part in this farce. I need you to find me, I can no longer breathe. And I want you to touch me, just to know I still feel, oh. Like a miracle.

the labyrinth,"Down on your knees to find your way. Through this labyrinth of whys. Time and again, rig and replay. When nothing justifies. Or leaves a trace to tell. A way out of your shell. To sample life. Time is a wraith. At the point of no return. A memory of the light of day. Time is ablaze. And so we burn. Until the ashes of our lives. Are blown away.

And against all odds. Still survive. Time is a wraith. At the point of no return. A memory of the light of day. Time is ablaze. And so we burn. Until the ashes of our lives. Are blown away. Wish I had the power to make you stay. For the sake of thrill. Would you own the kill?. Would you impose your will. On another still?. Time is a wraith. At the point of no return. A memory of the light of day. Time is ablaze. And so we burn. Until the ashes of our lives. Are blown away. Wish I had the power to make you stay"

So when I'm crying alone. Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone. Grow me a garden of roses. Paint me the colors of sky and rain. Teach me to speak with their voices. Show me the way and I will try again. I've heard the rumors, started fires,. I sowed a sordid lot of plays for keeps for what I need, behold the demons that I freed. I've tried my best at wearing the hard hat,. but healing doesn't seem to happen when you hide away the seed. And so I came across the medicine man, and he showed me what I'd forlorn.

nothing stays the same,I've talked to the ladies down the walk. I've drunk in tattoos that have brought the world to my eyes. Understanding opens doors. To the intricate weave of how good tomorrow could be. Been doused in elixir to numb my pains. And black and white thoughts have all bowed to me. As I've walked through their unlit corridors. And weak as I am you're like an angel standing by me. When sorrow calls my name. I know nothing stays the same. I've talked to the men of high regard. In rooms ever white and my soul grew. Dark by their words. Softly sweet as kissing lips. A kaleidoscope of no consolation at all. I've bargained my bit with fate and all. With no preconceptions of immortality. I rolled the dice uncompromised. And lost as I am you're my good samaritan. When sorrow calls my name. I know nothing stays the same

Would it fill our hearts. If I instilled a faith to guide us. Blind and sweet like free flow. A seed in every word. Could we lose the facades. Are we just jealous gods. With every wall ablaze around us. Calling out your name like it's now and never surrender. Victory is yours to claim. By every trick of light by sleight of hand. That makes a miracle reality right where you stand. They got their claws in good and deep. So you see there ain't no placing the blame. And so I'll build a bridge between us. Arcs of soaring rainbows. Strength of mother earth. For a brand new start. And instil new faith to guide us. Blind and sweet like free flow. With every single word. We won't go down as frauds. Like jealous gods. Like jealous gods. We are the perfect flaws. Perfect with our flaws. Just jealous gods. Just jealous gods. We're the perfect flaws. The perfect flaws. I can sense your apprehension. Fear for naught for I'm here and I'm made of your love. Found in the quick of things. And we can walk the bridge between us. Arcs of soaring rainbows. Strength of mother earth. Let it fill our hearts. And instil a faith to guide us. Blind and sweet like free flow. There's a joy for every hurt. Forgiveness in the flaws. Even for jealous gods"
daze,"Rolling down the freeway, master to the speed of light. Screaming up in the air, bursting through the night. No rest, I've stayed here too long, it's time to move on. Reality's a three way, a scenery defined. By tomorrow dubbed a mystery and the past just blurry lines. If there's ever been injustice in my name, I bow unto blame. And you can give me everything I need this way. We'll be loving till the first light of the day. Set the world on fire with bittersweet desire. To chase away the night, let the whole world burn. Set the world on fire for bliss in sweet denial, oblivion and peace. Will you let me burn?. Drifting like a cast off, the shadows got it good. With constant companions, would that I could. Further afield my nemesis on stilts is gaining on me. So I crawl across the state line, to another state of being. Holding on for dear life to the better days I've seen. Long for the comfort of your loving arms, your passions, your charms. And you can give me everything I need this way. Set the world on fire. Did you ever feel your love eclipsing the sun. I give you the reason I'm still on the run. Disappear in the heavy glare of neon. Set the world on fire"
15 min flame,"The reaper's kneeling at your field taking in what you've sown. Can't help feeling apprehension. No point in waiting, for a rating for what you have grown. Look for liquid consolation. If I act accordingly will it save my humanity. You're either you or a loyalty disowned. Well excuse me. Who was it who wanted every sec of the fifteen minute flame of fame. A name to last for all eternity. Who was it who wanted ingratiation beyond definitions. When love alone is enough to set you free. No escaping though you're running, you cannot find home. Drowning in your desperation. Conviction seems to follow accusations alone. No place here for an easy redemption. If I lack your tears of joy, please forgive my heartless ploy. Said the fool to his majesty dethroned. Now excuse me. Who was it who wanted every sec of the fifteen minute flame. To name a love to last through all your infamy. Who was it who wanted ingratiation in their definitions. When name alone can jail eternally. Who was it who wanted every sec of the flame. Who was it who wanted every sec of the fifteen minute flame of fame. A name to last for all eternity. Who was it who wanted ingratiation beyond definitions. When love alone is enough to set you free"

Not a penny to my name, just riding the motion. Yet like a child I still reach for the stars. But if this darkened hole is my conclusion. And the mother of pearl world is just a notion. I lose for playing out my part in this farce. I need you to find me, I can no longer breathe. And I want you to touch me, just to know I still feel, oh. Like a miracle.

How your own choices make your dream. Come out shining true all around you. My worth is the look in your eyes. My prize the smile playing tricks on your lips and I wonder again. Do you ever dream of the world like I do. I too fear the change coming on. Rolling out of the blue like a storm. Can you hear it scream at the hurt that I knew. How I wish you'd only see.... What is this chill at my heel. That makes the protections I've built around my pseudo world premiere. Tearing my utopian fiction apart as it happens to just pass along. I feel a change coming on. Rolling out of the blue like a storm. Crashing against my delirious thoughts where humanity's waiting alone. How I wish you'd only see..."

choice millionaire,"Cars in the night, cut through the mist. Baby suns for eyes, diamonds on your wrist. Twist in the scheme, a permeating theme. A violin crescendo. Dark violet skies over seas of lead. Hard violent fights, red sun will set. Like a rivulet, like a tear beget. A clear innuendo. Silence of the mind ever deafening. Rain on the roof ever prattling. Straddling truth for the pain you gain for pain. Some bill of rights. Daring getaways, steamy masquerades. Famine of all wars, whores and escapades. Jack of spades in silk brocades. Velvet nights in city lights. It's a wide wide world out there. And life can be a love affair. Or a cage of sheer despair. You're a choice millionaire. It's a wide wide world out there. You can travel in your easy chair. So build your castles in the air. You're a choice millionaire. Because no one needs. Any more confessions. Shadows cast without a streak of fear. Moments past, held so dear. A lock of hair, a touch of lip. A lashing whip. Subliminal love for the ones you hate. Lol as I abbreviate. Alleviate if you can relate to the pink slip. Of love unzipped. Minutes burning till seconds pop. Silhouettes dancing till the curtains drop. Stop before you lose your mojo. Your fear of heights. Hot passion flares every pipe dream. Concussion, blindness of a regime. A scream incites, the air ignites. The city lights. It's a wide wide world out there. So put a lacquer on your hunger. Parade the sky that you're under. Without heedless impressions. No one needs more confessions. It's a wide wide world out there"

I'll never be the one, no. To regret the things that. I have never done. And I'll reason with, with myself. Till I no longer feel the need to justify. I can't fight it. It takes me back.

dying to live,"Tell me this, would you miss it, trying on another face again to see if it's you. N' wondering where you've been and where you're gonna find yourself before the night is through. I know the way you go cos I've been the same for too long. Like I'm fearful that my choices are all wrong. I know the way you go cos I've lived your life of make believe. Dying to live. Tell me this, is it lonely in the shadow of a masquerade for life you hide behind. What's the deal with your reasons to run away and let your feelings leave you undefined. I know the way you go.... Behind me now the winding road they sing of. I've come to stand before a silent wall. Finally a chance to find a question. To point out the right answer after all ...this time. So rid us of the plight, the plight of self affliction. Generations choice the drug of self deception. I know the way you go..."

Run to the shelter tonight. United in silent resistance. Of bowing to false kings. So let me run to your shelter tonight. Run from this meaningless pantomime.

moonlight kissed,I see shadow and light. Stroking the mist. And I hear voices take flight. And send out our wish. Of peaceful dreams on a night. Moonlight kissed. Tendrils of smoke lash the street. And shamelessly court. Disguised honey sweet. To cater all sorts. And hushed tones all agree. And the world distorts. Wishing on a speck of dust. In this crazy ocean of fate. An echo of a memory. And maybe just a little too late. Fingers of blue on the snow. Reaching to touch. The warm light still aglow. Across the porch. We watch the scene die untold. Outside our window. For my words are the salt of lust. On that ivory skin. Difficult to hear at all. Through the everyday din. What is this if not some witchcraft?. Wrapped up widdershins. To lead us all astray. Hook in mouth. On through such webs of lies. Truth's a distant star. In our eyes. Moonlight kissed. New day comes again. And it laughs in your face. Whispering secrets of pain. By all its names. What flame could burn out the stain. Of a life misplaced?. But summer's scent still lingers. In your hair. Despite the ache. There's magic everywhere. Out the window run rebellion. Rapt with all you find. For seeking something new. Play in the ponds like summer's wind. Dance with the trees melding with mist. Beyond their flower field like. You're moonlight kissed

And this is one sacrifice I don't want to make. If there's no end. There can be no beginning, there can be no beginning. If there's no end. It feels like forsaking the dawn, we awaken and still we don't see. I am still secretly grateful you're living this moment with me. We can see where it leads. It's like you can't, can't kill the monster that feeds on you. No matter what you do it seems to get you every time. And that's a predicament if I know anything. If there's no end. There can be no beginning, there can be no beginning. If there's no end. It feels like forsaking the dawn, we awaken and still we don't see. I'm still secretly grateful you're living this moment with me. Secretly grateful you're sharing this moment with me. If it's just one life we're given, one time you're living. I feel your touch light up a wild desire. Borne on my ache to take us ever higher. In our love we are birds of prey. Every cry serves to lead astray. So carry my ache and you will know the feeling. Inside I am weak but for this love I'm bearing. So breathe your life in my shades of grey. Or kill the lights and we'll fade away. By: VaaL Silva"
nothing stays the same,I've talked to the ladies down the walk. I've drunk in tattoos that have brought the world to my eyes. Understanding opens doors. To the intricate weave of how good tomorrow could be. Been doused in elixir to numb my pains. And black and white thoughts have all bowed to me. As I've walked through their unlit corridors. And weak as I am you're like an angel standing by me. When sorrow calls my name. I know nothing stays the same. I've talked to the men of high regard. In rooms ever white and my soul grew. Dark by their words. Softly sweet as kissing lips. A kaleidoscope of no consolation at all. I've bargained my bit with fate and all. With no preconceptions of immortality. I rolled the dice uncompromised. And lost as I am you're my good samaritan. When sorrow calls my name. I know nothing stays the same
once upon a playground rainy,"Hello old lovers of mine. My little boy wishes. Of fortune's kisses. Now dreams cast aside. In the fading light. Your crown of thorns. Becomes a halo. Of branching horns. And yet so beautiful. . I see you gently swaying. In a sea of seesaws. Slumming in the shack. Tony built last year. I know you'll be holding. Court with jackdaws. Crying when nobody. Ever sees your tears. When no one sees your tears. What used to fly us from here. To the stratosphere?. What became of our passion. Is there no one who cares?. Hear the soft minor key. Of the one-time me. Still the acrobat. With my heart on my sleeve. And it's so beautiful. . I see you gently swaying. In a sea of seesaws. Slumming in the shack. Tony built last year. I know you'll be holding. Court with jackdaws. Crying when nobody. Ever sees your tears. When no one sees your tears. . Out back. When the gates are closed. Like a pitiful skeleton pose. We held our first line of defense. Saw our likeness. And it made no sense. Toy soldiers in the muck and dirt. Salvation in your every word. Lost in the fray of everyday. . I see you gently swaying. In a sea of seesaws. Slumming in the shack. Tony built last year. I know you'll be holding. Court with jackdaws. Crying when nobody. Ever sees your tears. When no one sees your tears. . You're still fighting, I see. Like a modern day Bruce Lee. Standing proud in this parody"

passion colors everything,"This is my toothpaste moment,. Oh, I'll need to flash a smile.. I'll be the super-absorbent-man,. Watch them flock to me in single file.. And I'll need to do it with style,. I need to keep me up to date. Swallowing the sun, run another mile,. It's overrated how we underrate.. I dance in tune with what I fear. To do adrenaline.

Everything, everything, everything.... I have a mind for simple things,. But things are not of mind to simplify;. There's always some loophole technicality. You buy into and pay until you die.. And money doesn't bring me joy,. It's more a darling dead weight. And I seem to have lost my appetite,. It's underrated how we overrate.. I dance entangled with my dear,. She pulls my every string. Completely trapped yet never here,. When passion colors everything.... And when I'm finally brought to my senses,. Parade the rain on my parade.. Before I'm back to my defenses. To watch the whole thing escalate"
psychosis,"Well it's a different man in your face. And so out of place. That you can see anything there that you wish. Kiss my bliss.... It's like I'm a welcoming freakshow doormat. Held in awe while growing fat in the head. This is where we all should see red. A big fat wet slab of red.. And I see that it makes me anti-everything. And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin.... Revelation leading to my psychosis and inspiration. Digest another hallucination psychosis by recreation. Happy till the next deterioration.. Psychosis.... For you it's a different notion of music and motion. A dance of lights,. A prosaic ocean ,. A delicate nearly transparent creation of somebody's. Soul on the screen has caught you in between. Of somebody's life on the stage and somebodys life on. The frontpage and this is where we all should see red. A big fat laughing mouth of red!. And I see that it makes me anti-everything. And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin.... I think I'm gonna start my own religion. Seems to be the recipe for a new sensation. Think it's gonna make a trendy revolution. Quite the contribution to the unnatural selection..."
rebirth,"What is beauty compared to grief. What is joy in league with sorrow. A dead rushes' fleet drifting on a quiet tide. N' does a sunset know its worth. Making yesterday tomorrow. Is there a silence on this earth. Before every tear's been cried. For you, for you. I would bring down the heavens on this earth. For you, for you. I would even trust the devil for rebirth. With every road once paved with gold. Both hands with a heart to hold. How could we look past all the stories we have told. Could we lose ourselves again. In a childlike faith. Trust the wishing well, dance like tinker bell. For you, for you. I would walk forever through this barren land. For you, for you. I would hold a deadly viper in my hand. For you, for you. I would bring down the heavens on this earth. For you, for you. I would even trust the devil for rebirth"

rewind,"What do we have but illusions where one man's absolute is another's choice. Giving in to confusion, till love and hate both tempt with the same voice. Won't you take me to a higher ground, I need to see again the way I'm bound. N' choose the uneasy redemption, run by fear and the flaws of attraction. Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side. So I'll know it will not leave me wanting, I see my heart, waving me bye-bye. Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side. If life itself has a meaning, is it anything more than what we choose to call it.

N' give in to the rumor seduction, run by fear and all the good intentions. Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side. So I'll know it will not leave me wanting, like my love, kissing me good bye. Rewind, I wanna go it again, light up the dark, halo on the side. If this is how we think we make amends.

roses,"I've walked the distance,. I paid my dues and tried to have a go at what I thought I knew was real, held no appeal. I've been to places, I've seen the tidings,. I bought a book of rules for every coin that I could steal. And so I came to gaze upon the stars, when they were yet unborn. And consequently, tear at my old scars, and the mask I had outworn. So when I'm crying alone. Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone. Grow me a garden of roses. Paint me the colors of sky and rain. Teach me to speak with their voices. Show me the way and I will try again. I've heard the rumors, started fires,. I sowed a sordid lot of plays for keeps for what I need, behold the demons that I freed. I've tried my best at wearing the hard hat,. but healing doesn't seem to happen when you hide away the seed. And so I came across the medicine man, and he showed me what I'd forlorn. For if I'm stayed it happens by my own hand, and my own voice full of scorn. So when I'm crying alone. Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone. Grow me a garden of roses. Paint me the colors of sky and rain. Teach me to speak with their voices. Show me the way and I will try again. Without you I'm nothing at all. And life has the face of a morbid game. With you nothing is impossible. It all seems to fit the frame. So when I'm crying alone. Yeah, when I'm cold as a dying stone. Grow me a garden of roses. Paint me the colors of sky and rain. Teach me to speak with their voices. Show me the way and I will try again"

N' I know they would steal your heart. To see my love tortured. Render trust a hostage to fortune. Rumors seduce like fire. Seducing illusions driving the chariot. Of hearts astray. Standing silent vigil over the moments. Of ease that still remain. With a thorn to the side for every good deed. N' I know they would steal your heart. Every day is a day we awake into this life. Another chance another line to define. And we will dance, we will play. And experience a lifetime. Every day is a day we die. Cos I know they would steal your heart. N' I know they would steal. Your heart to see my love tortured. Render trust a hostage to fortune. Rumors seduce like wildfire. Steal your heart to see my love tortured"

smoke and mirrors,"I danced a tango with my hubris high on youth. We swept across the dance floor to subjective truth. But there was no harmony there. No reason for coexistence. Nothing to span the distance, now. Do we even know who we are. Living like all life is forfeit. Like we can just go redefine it. Regardless what we broke. Who died and made us stars. With our intellectual gambits. Our millionaire flair and our antics. We're like mirrors seen through smoke. I tried a shanty with the fool to find my pace. Anything from puns to jests to intertwine our ways. But there was no loyalty to hope. And funny the need for mercy. How it makes us bleed all mercy, now. Do we even know who we are.... Now the melody's void of sympathy. cos that shit's in byte size bits on YouTube. so tell me what am I supposed to do. When the malady's no remedy. Till we reach the lowest absolute. And necessity will finally force something through what's walling you. Do we even know who we are..."

the ballad of jeremiah peacekeeper,He stares out the window. Blank as a canvas. Made up in the sunlight. And swirling smoke and ash. He waits for a breath now. Takin' his time. He sees an eternity. In the blink of an eye. And for him this life is made of time and choices. An endless blend of vistas. Painted bright with memories. The here and now will bow to him. To only serve one purpose. To keep your peace. He takes on the world all in a stride. And your wounds will be his scars. So won't you remember when the night comes. He will need your open arms. For to be invincible he needs your love. He stands in the doorway. Quiet like yesterday. With forgotten thoughts become a mystery. And nightmares locked away. He looks like a gunman. But his view is much too wide. For Such a solution. So he fights. Without a six gun on his side. And all the while his stars and moon shine brightly. Outside the desert wails a curse of rage and jealousy. And yet tomorrow comes along. And shapes to serve his purpose. To keep your peace. He takes on the world all in a stride. And your wounds will be his scars. So won't you remember when the night comes. He will need your open arms. For to be invincible he needs your love. He takes on the world all in a stride. And your wounds will be his scars. So won't you remember when the night comes. He will need your open arms. For to be invincible he needs your love. He takes on the world all in a stride. And your wounds will be his scars. So won't you remember when the night comes. He will need your open arms. For to be invincible he needs your love. For to be invincible he needs your love
the beautiful one,"Flies with a broken wing, she's ever so graceful, so like an angel,. but I see, tears flow quietly.. The struggle she's seen this spring, when nothing comes dancing,. paying a handsome fee, and still she smiles at me.. And I can't take it, no I can't help but wonder.... Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?. How do you break a heart of gold?. Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?. Heroes of tales unsung, untold.. Sweet as an angel sings, she gives though she has none left but the. last one, free, unhesitatingly.. And I am humbled, I'm a broken mirror, and I can't help but wonder.... Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?. How do you break a heart of gold?. Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?. Heroes of tales unsung, untold.. Why do we sacrifice the beautiful ones?. Why when they walk with love alone?. Why do we sacrifice our beautiful souls?. Just trying to find their way home."
the child in me,Some people never. Settle for the one. One love forever. Searching for the sun. Heat-blasted faces. Promises at dawn. A constant flux of stages. Before they're gone. . How do you live so gracefully?. (And would you show me). How can I save the child in me?. (A world the child would see). How do you fault so gracefully?. Serenity in a shattered world. The child in me. Harlos by the half-moon. Charlatans by wine. Seeking out your pleasure. The sweet concubine. That abrasive acquaintance. It's a wonder how we fall. Stopping at these stations before they're gone. . How do you live so gracefully?. (And would you show me). How can I save the child in me?. (A world the child would see). How do you fault so gracefully?. Serenity in a shattered world. The child in me. I've been waiting. Feel the love rebuilding. Off the edge now. Falling down. 'Cause I've been waiting. I've been biding my time. On the edge now. Falling down. . How do you live so gracefully?. (And would you show me). How can I save the child in me?. (A world the child would see). How do you fault so gracefully?. Serenity in a shattered world. The child in me. The child in me. The child in me
the distance,"Is this really how quickly it goes away?. I can't feel my emotions right today. Cuz I still love how you say my name. I still touch your kiss and my pain away. Still see your tears through the rain. This burning sensation so strange. Feel the distance, bring us closer. Won't anyone come a soothe. We can touch now. Just a little now. We just will never burn again. I've seen this yearning day go on the right number. The memory of you will meet your modestly lingers on. Still love how you say my name. I still touch your kiss and my pain away. Still see your tears through the rain. This burning sensation so strange. Feel the distance, bring us closer. Won't anyone come and soothe my pain. We can touch now. Just a little now. We just will never burn again. Don't you worry. There'll be a time when I'll speak the same. Led life caring. Across the distance I still see your flame. Don't you worry. There'll be a time when I'll speak the same. Led life caring. Still love how you say my name. I still touch your kiss and my pain away. Still see your tears through the rain.

the game,"She's plastic. She's speed-read. A classic line between the lines. Fantastic and half-dead. His tactic blind to warning signs. Her clashes of colors. Are flashes of society. In ashes. His dollars like posters of a tragic love story. . See the puppet master laugh. Astride a pale horse. And take another photograph. For selfie intercourse. Reading out the epitaph. Of our pointless wars. For love we will tear us down. He's shooting at shadows. Portraying a proper soldier boy. She's thinking in logos. Still searching for the real Mccoy. Broadcasters, they've got this. Disasters a wasp of a satire. Like actors who French kiss. Right after someone stole their fire. . See the puppet master laugh. Astride a pale horse. And take another photograph. For selfie intercourse. Reading out the epitaph. Of our pointless wars. For love we will tear. Us down that beaten path she treads. Mirage the blushing bride he weds. Yesterday's diamonds and pearls. Now worthless trinkets in their world. The salty tang of blood. Sensations running hot. Snow blindness in pitch darkness. Mindless rage. And then you. . See the puppet master laugh. And take another photograph. . See the puppet master laugh. Astride a pale horse. And take another photograph. For selfie intercourse. Reading out the epitaph. Of our pointless wars. When love. Love could be our crown"

the labyrinth,"Down on your knees to find your way. Through this labyrinth of whys. Time and again, rig and replay. When nothing justifies. Or leaves a trace to tell. A way out of your shell. To sample life. Time is a wraith. At the point of no return. A memory of the light of day. Time is ablaze. And so we burn. Until the ashes of our lives. Are blown away. Wish I had the power to make you stay. Out through the frozen haze of grey. If constellations align. More brutally sliced by lie than blade. Three acts of cruel design. Disconnect the dots. And against all odds. Still survive. Time is a wraith. At the point of no return. A memory of the light of day. Time is ablaze. And so we burn. Until the ashes of our lives. Are blown away. Wish I had the power to make you stay. For the sake of thrill. Would you own the kill?. Would you impose your will. On another still?. Time is a wraith. At the point of no return. A memory of the light of day. Time is ablaze. And so we burn. Until the ashes of our lives. Are blown away. Wish I had the power to make you stay"
the lie eternal,"I'm here, tonight. The passion of your life. To all the stakes you will be. Let me in time. So let me come inside. Your heart, your mind, lie to you. To see yourself in a different light. Where my hungry desire finds oblivion. In your embrace, all mistakes forgiven. In your embrace. I'm here, I'm now arrived. I fell into your love. I fell into your lie eternal. I'm here, I'm now survived. I fell into your love. I fell into your lie. You're my sweet tribe. All my vestatives of hope. Pin wishes upon this. To prove I can be right. For you and me, this old damn controversy. Will shift its course, for better or for worse. In your embrace, all illusions broken. In your embrace. I'm here, I'm now arrived. I fell into your love. I fell into your lie eternal. I'm here, I'm now survived. I fell into your love. I fell into your lie. If you didn't desire me, my world could never feel more surreal. Cuz you told me you can touch me deep enough to heal. And if you didn't inspire me then on my knees I would fall like rain. Cuz you told me you can calm me with your touch. Your voice so softly whisperin'. I'm here, I'm now arrived. I fell into your love. I fell into your lie eternal. I'm here, I'm now survived. I fell into your love. I fell into your. I'm here, I'm now arrived. I fell into your love. I fell into your lie eternal. I'm here, I'm now survived. I fell into your love. I fell into your lie"
the poet and the muse,Theres an old tale wrought. With mystery Town. The poet and his muse. And the magic lake. Which gave a life. To the words the poet used. Now the muse she was his happiness. And he rhymed about her grace. And told her stories of treasures. Deep beneath the blackened waves. Till in the stillness of one dawn. Still in its mystic crown. The muse she went down to the lake. And in the waves she drowned. And now to see your love set free. You will need the witches cabin key. Find the lady of the light gone mad with the night. Thats how you reshape destiny. The Poet came down to the lake. To call out to his dear. When there was no answer. He was overcome with fear. He searched in vain for his treasure lost. And too soon the night would fall. And only his own echo. Would wail back at his call. And when he swore to bring back his love. By the stories hed create. Nightmares shifted endlessly. In the darkness of the lake. And now to see your love set free. You will need the witches cabin key. Find the lady of the light still ravin in the night. Thats how you reshape destiny. In the dead of night she came to him. with darkness in her eyes. Wearing a mourning gown. Sweet words as her disguise. He took her in without a word. For he saw his grave mistake. And vowed them both to silence. Deep beneath the lake. Now if its real or just a dream. One mystery remains. For it is said. On moonless nights. they may still haunt this place. And now to see your love set free. You will need the witches cabin key. Find the lady of the light gone mad with the night. Thats how you reshape destiny. And now to see your love set free. You will need the witches cabin key. Find the lady of the light still ravin in the night. Thats how you reshape destiny. By: VaaL Silva
the ultimate fling,"Today, it's in the air again today,. Another incident that just went off. No way, this time I will not take blame,. Its pretty obvious who needs to shut up. Ashtrays filled with. The fruits of our transgressions,. Here and there sarcasm overflows. Do stay, I'll need this. Sitcom to be re-run. Till I get the gist of just how it goes. What would you have me do. Gimme a reason,. C'mon now make my day. 'cause I'm out of cheeks to turn the other way. Ask yourself just how. Lucky do you feel. Somehow I've been blindsided. By my own kindhearted notion. Of just who we are. No doubt we'd. Have collided anyway. With me indicted and you raising alarm. First round I'll take. My bows into my corner. Take my vows, regroup and run back again. Bloodhound and of no better pedigree. Than what you see so you could not offend. Did I act like a fool. 'cause I didn't know what to do. When you gave me just a little bit. More than I bargained for. A little too much in my hands. When my hands are tied. It's the ultimate fling. To go frolicking. Licking the muck from. The soles of the boots of your pride. Everytime you lied. Gimme a reason,. C'mon now make my day. 'cause I'm out of cheeks to turn the other way. Ask yourself just how. Lucky do you feel. Gimme a reason,. C'mon now make my day. Spoken my pleas now someone's gotta pay. Ask yourself just how. Lucky do you feel. Oh, yeah, gimme a reason. You make my day. Cause someone's gotta pay. Can you gimme a reason,. Movin' into grey. Something I can hold on. To at the end of the day. 'cause I can't move on till. I know what's the deal. Gimme a reason,. C'mon now make my day. 'cause I'm out of cheeks to turn the other way. Ask yourself just how. Lucky do you feel. Gimme a reason,. C'mon now make my day. Spoken my pleas now someone's gotta pay. Ask yourself just how. Lucky do you feel"
war,Do you remember standing on a broken field. White crippled wings beating the sky. The harbingers of war with their nature revealed. And our chances flowing by. If I can let the memory heal. I will remember you with me on that field. When I thought that I fought this war alone. You were there by my side on the frontline. When I thought that I fought without a cause. You gave me a reason to try. Turn the page I need to see something new. For now my innocence is torn. We cannot linger on this stunted view. Like rabid dogs of war. I will let the memory heal. I will remember you with me on that field. When I thought that I fought this war alone. You were there by my side on the frontline. And we fought to believe the impossible. When I thought that I fought this war alone. We were one with our destinies entwined. When I thought that I fought without a cause. You gave me the reason why. With no-one wearing their real face. It's a whiteout of emotion. And I've only got my brittle bones to break the fall. When the love in letters fade. It's like moving in slow motion. And we're already too late if we arrive at all. And then we're caught up in the arms race. An involuntary addiction. And we're shedding every value our mothers taught. So will you please show me your real face. Draw the line in the horizon. Cos I only need your name to call the reasons why I fought. When I thought that I fought this war alone...
where do we draw the line?,"On your palm an endless wonder. Lines that speak the truth without a sound. In your eyes awaits the tireless hunger. Already looks for prey to run down. So why do we keep up this charade. How do we tell apart the time to leave from the time to wait. What does tomorrow want with me. What does it matter what I see. If it can't be my design. Tell me where do we draw the line. The dance of flames and shadows in the street. Make poetry nobody's ever heard. The weight of loneliness stands on your feet. The cage already there around the bird. So why don't we join the masquerade. Before it all falls apart before our love becomes insatiate. What does tomorrow want with me. What does it matter what I see. If I can't choose my own design. Tell me where do we draw the line. Where's the cooling wind. Where's the evergreen field. Where's my mother's open arms. Where's my father lionheart. S'like the sun's gone down. Sleeps in the hallowed ground now. With the autumn's browns leaves. With the one who never grieves. What does tomorrow want with me. What does it matter what I see. If we all walk behind the blind. Tell me where do we draw the line. Whatever tomorrow wants from me. At least I'm here, at least I'm free. Free to choose to see the signs. This is my line"
you're still here,"Mercury dances in its skyscraper cell, rising and falling like rhapsody. And I see winter's broken like lace, in time for a celebration. Thaw wails inside the walls and laughs in the corners, delighting in its evident victory. Till I feel springtime counting its days of flaunting a novel sensation. Like it's leaving, leaving behind the weight vying for yesteryear. Leaving promises in its wake, whispering, my love, you're still here. Hold on to your memories of sundogs and rainbows, as time writes a premature eulogy. And I feel summertime passing in haste, like running out of patience. Quilted with knit and umbrellas and scarfs and a mild understanding of irony. I feel autumn leaving the race, all done with the exhilaration. It's leaving, leaving behind the weight vying for yesteryear. Leaving promises in its wake, whispering, my love, you're still here. Mercury dances in its skyscraper cell, rising and falling in harmony. And I feel winter stealing my days, to herald another creation"
