The moon you have embraced you left him spell-bound, staggered, in his starry, starry place. Round, round, round, he's spinning round you, round you. Dancing, twirling, in a wild lunar chase. Though the moon's all but eclipsed tonight. By curtains and candlelight he's tapping at me through the window pane. In his top hat and cane..."
