have you passed through this night?,"This great evil - where's it come from?. How'd it steal into the world?. What seed, what root did it grow from?. Who's doing this?. Who's killing us, robbing us of life and light, mocking us with the sight of what we mighta known?. Does our ruin benefit the earth, aid the grass to grow and the sun to shine?. Is this darkness in you, too?. Have you passed through this night?"
