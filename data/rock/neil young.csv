I want to see you dance again. Because I'm still in love with you. On this harvest moon

And put the last bullet between your eyes"

But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper.. So all you critics sit alone. You're no better than me for what you've shown.. With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams. We could get together for some scenes.. Well, I'm up in T.O. keepin' jive alive,. And out on the corner it's half past five.. But the subways are empty. And so are the cafes..

Who can tell you you're just pissin' in the wind.. I never knew a man could tell so many lies. He had a different story for every set of eyes.. How can he remember who he's talkin' to?. 'Cause I know it ain't me, and I hope it isn't you"

pocahontas,"Aurora borealis. The icy sky at night. Paddles cut the water. In a long and hurried flight. From the white man to the fields of green. And the homeland we've never seen.. They killed us in our tepee. And they cut our women down. They might have left some babies. Cryin' on the ground. But the firesticks and the wagons come. And the night falls on the setting sun.. They massacred the buffalo. Kitty corner from the bank. The taxis run across my feet. And my eyes have turned to blanks. In my little box at the top of the stairs. With my Indian rug and a pipe to share.. I wish a was a trapper. I would give thousand pelts. To sleep with Pocahontas. And find out how she felt. In the mornin' on the fields of green. In the homeland we've never seen.. And maybe Marlon Brando. Will be there by the fire. We'll sit and talk of Hollywood. And the good things there for hire. Like the Astrodome and the first tepee. Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me. Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me"

all those dreams,"When the morning comes and you're still sleeping. With all those dreams in your pretty head. I light a fire while the sun comes creeping. All across the meadow bed. The old clock has stopped, no longer ticking. No longer counting every second. Out by the car, our snowman's melting. Nothing can bring 'em back now. His smile a twig and his nose a cucumber. His eyes two pinecones looking out. We got pictures of him like two little kids laughing. In the snow we were walking hand in hand. We went looking for a big surprise. And when we found before our eyes. Two white elks grazing on the green. We heard the honkers coming. Landing on the lake of summer. Nesting there and waiting for a dream. When the morning comes and you're still sleeping. With all those dreams in your pretty head. I light a fire and the sun comes creeping. All across the meadow bed"

ambulance blues,"Back in the old folky days. The air was magic when we played.. The riverboat was rockin' in the rain. Midnight was the time for the raid.. Oh, Isabela, proud Isabela,. They tore you down and plowed you under.. You're only real with your make-up on. How could I see you and stay too long?. All along the Navajo Trail,. Burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails.. Waitresses are cryin' in the rain. Will their boyfriends pass this way again?. Oh, Mother Goose, she's on the skids. Sure ain't happy, neither are the kids.. She needs someone that she can scream at. And I'm such a heel for makin' her feel so bad.. I guess I'll call it sickness gone. It's hard to say the meaning of this song.. An ambulance can only go so fast. It's easy to get buried in the past. When you try to make a good thing last.. I saw today in the entertainment section. There's room at the top for private detection.. To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter,. But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper.. So all you critics sit alone. You're no better than me for what you've shown.. With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams. We could get together for some scenes.. Well, I'm up in T.O. keepin' jive alive,. And out on the corner it's half past five.. But the subways are empty. And so are the cafes.. Except for the Farmer's Market. And I still can hear him say:. You're all just pissin' in the wind. You don't know it but you are.. And there ain't nothin' like a friend. Who can tell you you're just pissin' in the wind.. I never knew a man could tell so many lies. He had a different story for every set of eyes.. How can he remember who he's talkin' to?. 'Cause I know it ain't me, and I hope it isn't you"

big green country,Across the plain flew the lone grey rider. Leather bang pounding on his back. Above the clouds the moon was climbing higher. A pack of wolves wanted their money back. With folded arms the chief stood watching. Painted braves slipped down the hill. In his ears the spirit talking. As they closed in. For an easy kill. At the house the door was wide open. Wind blew curtains off the rod. She was waiting and hoping. She was praying to her god. He was luckier than most men. He was barely in his prime. As she stood their in the doorway. Her long dress flowing. Would he make it this time. . Over the hill in the big green country. That's the place where the cancer cowboy rides. Pure as the driven snow before it got him. Sometimes I feel like he's all right. Sometimes I feel like a piece of paper. Sometimes I feel like my own name. Sometimes I feel different later. Sometimes I feel. I feel just the same.

born in ontario,"You might see me down in Alabama. Or Baton Rouge down in Louisiana. I might make it up to Detroit City. Where people work hard and life is gritty. It don't really matter where I am. It's what I do, it's what I can. This old world has been good to me. So I try to give back and I want to be free. I was born in Ontario. I was born in Ontario, Ontario, Ontario, Ontario. [Guitar solo]. I still like to sing a happy song. Once in a while and things go wrong. I pick up a pen, scribble on a page. Try to make sense of my inner rage. One cold winter we went down south. With daddy's typewriter for a couple of months. And I was born in Ontario. I was born in Ontario, Ontario, Ontario, Ontario. [Guitar solo]. I was born in Ontario. Where the black fly bites. And the green grass grows. That's where I learned most of what I know. Cause you don't learn much. When you start to get old. I left home at a tender young age. Cause mom and daddy never liked to stay. In any one place for very long. We just kept moving, moving on. I was born in Ontario. I was born in Ontario, Ontario, Ontario, Ontario"
borrowed tune,"I'm climbin' this ladder,. My head in the clouds. I hope that it matters,. I'm havin' my doubts.. I'm watchin' the skaters. Fly by on the lake.. Ice frozen six feet deep,. How long does it take?. I look out on peaceful lands. With no war nearby,. An ocean of shakin' hands. That grab at the sky.. I'm singin' this borrowed tune. I took from the Rolling Stones,. Alone in this empty room. Too wasted to write my own.. I'm climbin' this ladder,. My heads in the clouds. I hope that it matters.."
bound for glory,"Out on the trans-Canada highway. There was a girl hitchhiking with her dog. Fireflies buzzin' round her head. Like candles in the fog.. He was three miles down the road. Tryin' to stay up, but he knew that he couldn't. She was looking for a ride through the night. But out there, who wouldn't.. They were bound for glory. Bound for living on the edge. They were bound for each other. Like two comets heading for a bed.. She had a new way of living. New way of looking at life. He had an '84 International and two kids. He left back home with his wife.. He was tired of writin' letters to himself. And living in the dark. She was open to suggestions. And some say she had a broken heart.. He had everything he wanted. 'Til it all turned out to be a job. One fallen asleep trucker. And a girl hitchhiking with her dog.. They were bound for glory. Bound for living on the edge. They were bound for each other. Like two comets heading for a bed.. She had a new way of living. New way of looking at life. He had an '84 International and two kids. He left back home with his wife.. Out on the trans-Canada highway. The sun came climbing up the cab. By the time it hit the window they were wakin' up. From what little sleep they had.. When that heat hit the blankets. They were looking for love at second sight. Just starin' in each others' eyes. Findin' it in the mornin' light.. They were bound for glory. Bound for living on the edge. They were bound for each other. Like two blankets layin' on a bed.. She had a new way of living. New way of looking at life. He had an '84 International and two kids. He left back home with his wife.."

bringin' down dinner,"The evening fog was rollin' in. It was gettin' hard to see. The old white car edged down the road. Headed for the Double â€˜E'. She was bringin' down dinner for Grandpa. It was crawling with vitamins. And tender as a mother's love. Tender as a mother's love. When she saw the TV vans. The side door was open. There were three TVs. Grandpa's face was on every one. He was talkin' to a woman with a microphone. She was sexy and her hair was all done. Sun Green came down and met Grandma then. ""My you're such a beautiful girl.. Mother Earth needs more like you.. You should go out now and see the world.. ""What's Grandpa doin' on TV?. I got his dinner in the car.. All these vans have blocked our way. But we can carry it,."

Did you see him, did you see him?. Did you see him in the river?. He were there to wave to you.. Could you tell that the empty quivered,. Brown skinned Indian on the banks. That were crowded and narrow,. Held a broken arrow?. The streets were lined for the wedding parade,. The Queen wore the white gloves, the county of song,. The black covered caisson her horses had drawn. Protected her King from the sun rays of dawn.. They married for peace and were gone.. Did you see them, did you see them?. Did you see them in the river?. They were there to wave to you.. Could you tell that the empty quivered,. Brown skinned Indian on the banks. That were crowded and narrow,. Held a broken arrow?."
buffalo springfield again,"Used to play in a rock 'n roll band,. But they broke up. We were young and we were wild. It ate us up. Now I'm not saying who was right or wrong. Looking out on a big green lawn,. Girls and boys. Playing in the afternoon sun,. And life's a joy. I heard an old song playing on a radio. Buffalo Springfield again. Like to see those guys again. And give it a shot. Maybe now we can show the world. What we got. But I'd just like to play for the fun we had. Buffalo Springfield again."

Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.. Even Richard Nixon has got. Soul.. The podium rocks in the crowded waves.. The speaker talks of the beautiful saves. That went down long before he played this role. For the hotel queens and the magazines,. Test tube genes and slot machines. Where even Richard Nixon got soul.. Even Richard Nixon has got it,. Soul.. Hospitals have made him cry,. But there's always a free way in his eye,. Though his beach just got to crowded for his stroll.. Roads stretch out like healthy veins,. And wild gift horses strain the reins,. Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.. Even Richard Nixon has got. Soul.. I am a lonely visitor.. I came too late to cause a stir,. Though I campaigned all my life towards that goal."

captain kennedy,I am a young mariner headed to war. I'm thinkin' 'bout my family and what it was for. There's water on the wood and the sails feel good. And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good.. My father was a sailor named Captain Kennedy. He lost his wooden schooner to the Germans on the sea. Exploded on the water for everyone to see. And humiliate that American Captain Kennedy.. I saw him in Nassau in 1971. His strength was failin' but he still ran a run. He worked 'til his fingers wore to the bone. To buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own.. He was known in the islands as hundred foot iron. That steel hull freighter was passin' its time. And time flew by faster with life on the sea. And the days grew shorter for Captain Kennedy.. I am a young mariner headed to war. I'm thinkin' 'bout my family and what it was for. There's water on the wood and the sails feel good. And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good..

Said the widow's best friend, Ann,. ""I'll just take it and go."". ""I'll give her the money later. Say it was in his shoe. That way she'll never find out. That'll do."".

To be heard."". ""Well, thank you, Chief, I sure would.. Carmichael was a partner of mine.. He was always very careful.. And he played it straight down the line."". One by one, the officers spoke. And the service came to a close. He had no living relatives but his wife. And she never showed. She just couldn't face the men. They all understood. They got in their cars. And drove home as directly as they could. ""Carmichael, you asshole,"". the new widow sobbed beneath her veil. ""Shot down in the line of duty. Is that how justice never fails?"". ""I wish that things were better. When we said goodbye today. But we had our share of good times though. Along the way.. ""Remember, hey Mr. Las Vegas,. You used to be so cool. We met Wayne Newton down at Pebble Beach. And you acted like a fool?. ""We just couldn't stop laughing. It seemed so funny to us. We left our luggage back in the hotel. And almost missed the bus..

For one year nobody parked a car."

changes,"Sit by my side, come as close as the air. Share in a memory of gray. Wander in my words, dream about the pictures. That I play of changes. Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall. To brown and to yellow they fade. And then they have to die, trapped within. the circle time parade of changes. Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind. Visions of shadows that shine. Til one day I returned and found they were the. Victims of the vines of changes. The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark. Swings through a hollow of haze. A race around the stars, a journey through. The universe ablaze with changes. Moments of magic will glow in the night. All fears of the forest are gone. But when the morning breaks they're swept away by. golden drops of dawn, of changes. Passions will part to a strange melody. As fires will sometimes burn cold. Like petals in the wind, we're puppets to the silver. strings of souls, of changes. Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else. One last cup of wine we will pour. And I'll kiss you one more time, and leave you on. the rolling river shores of changes"

And a new Rolling Stone.. Yeah.. There's still crime in the city,. Said the cop on the beat,. I don't know if I can stop it. I feel like meat on the street. They paint my car like a target.

But that's the way all my friends are. Except maybe one or two. Wish I could see him this weekend. Wish I could walk in his shoes. But now I'm doin' my own thing. Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad. Although my home has been broken. It's the best home I ever had. Yeah.. Well, I keep gettin' younger. My life's been funny that way. Before I ever learned to talk. I forgot what to say. I sassed back to my mom. I sassed back to my teacher. I got thrown out of Bible school. For sassin' back at the preacher. Then I grew up to be a fireman. Put out every fire in town. Put out anything smokin'. But when I put the hose down. The judge sent me to prison. He gave me life without parole. Wish I never put the hose down."

But I believe in action. When push comes to shove. ""Who cares what you believe,"". Said the captain, amazed. ""If you stood in my shoes. Your eyes would be glazed"". So, my fair damsel. Won't you take your leave. Are you headed for the country?. Where you wear the greensleeves. And the children laugh. And the old folks sing. And the church bell tolls. For a miraculous thing. Where the big red furnace. Just blooms and glows. Where the big heart beats."

If love is a piece of dust shining in the sun,. All I want is a song of love. Song of love to sing to you. All I need is this song for love. To sing for you. Song of love. Song of love."

In the early morning rain. With no place to go. Out on runway number nine. Big seven-o-seven set to go. But I'm stuck here in the grass. Where the cold wind blows. Now the liquor tasted good. And the women all were fast. Well there she goes my friend. Well she's rollin' down at last. Hear the mighty engines roar. See the silver bird on high. She's away and westward bound. Far above the clouds she'll fly. Where the mornin' rain don't fall. And the sun always shines. She'll be flyin' o'er my home. In about three hours time. This old airport's got me down. It's no earthly good to me. 'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground. As cold and drunk as I can be. You can't jump a jet plane. Like you can a freight train. So I'd best be on my way.

eldorado,In the crystal ball. The gypsy sees the villa. The riders on the hill. The fire in the fields. She sees the mission bell. Swinging in the silence. Now the shooting starts. The bullets pierce the hearts. The seqoritas crying at the well.. Up in the Gold Hotel. The money hits the table. The heavies all are there. That's why the deal's goin' down. Beautiful women all dressed in. Diamonds and sable. Down upon the street. Beside a garbage heap. A Mariachi band begins to play.. Somewhere a blues guitar. Plays echoes in the alleyway. The Tijuana dawn. Claims another day. The golden sun. Rises on the runway. The pilot understands. The money changes hands. Inside the jet the briefcase snaps. Goodbye.. In Eldorado town. There lives a great bullfighter. His eyes are screaming blue. His hair is red as blood. And when the gate goes up. The crowd gets so excited. And he comes dancin' out. Dressed in gold lami. He kills the bull and lives another day..

falling from above,"Grandpa said to cousin Jed. Sitting on the porch,. ""I won't retire. But I might retread."". Seem like that guy singin' this song. Been doing it for a long time. Is there anything he knows. That he ain't said?. Sing a song for freedom. Sing a song for love. Sing a song for depressed angels. Falling from above.. Grandpa held the paper. Pretending he could see. But he couldn't read. Without his glasses on. ""How can all those people. Afford so many things?. When I was young we wore. What we had on."". Mamma said, ""A little love and affection. In everything you do. Will make the world a better place. With or without you.. ""A little love and affection. In everything you do. A better place. With or without you."". Slamming down some late night shots. The artist and the hero compare. Those envisions and afterthoughts. For the twenty first century.. But mostly came up with nothing. So the truth was never learned. And the human race just. Kept rollin' on.. Rollin' through the fighting. Rollin' through the religious wars. Rollin' down the temple walls. And the churches' exposed sores.. Rollin' through the fighting. Through religious wars. Mostly came up with nothing.... ""Grandpa, here's your glasses;. You'll see much better now,"". Said that young girl. Of Edith and Earl's.. But Grandpa just kept starin'. He was lost in some distant thought. Then he turned and he said. To that young girl,. ""A little love and affection. In everything you do. Will make the world a better place. With or without you.. ""A little love and affection. In everything you do. A better place. With or without you."". Hear the rooster crowin'. Down on the Double E. It's a new morning. Breaking on the green.. Bouncing off the Towers,. The sun's heading for the street. The business meeting. Window shades are drawn.. Another morning edition. Is headed for the porch. Because Grandma puts down the paper. Before Grandpa raises his fork.. A little love and affection. In every thing you do. A better place."

Bailout coming but it's not for you. Got my flat screen. Got it repo'd now. They picked it up. Left a hole in the wall. Last Saturday. Missed the Raiders game.

four strong winds,"Think I'll go out to Alberta,. Weather's good there in the fall.. I got some friends that I can go to working for,. Still I wish you'd change your mind. If I asked you one more time,. But we've been through that a hundred times or more.. Four strong winds that blow lonely,. Seven seas that run high,. All those things that don't change, Come what may.. If the good times are all gone,. And I'm bound for moving on.. I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.. If I get there before the snow flies,. And if things are looking good,. You could meet me if I send you down the fare.. But by then it would be winter. Not too much for you to do. And the wind sure can blows cold way out there. Four strong winds that blow lonely,. Seven seas that run high,. All those things that don't change, Come what may.. If the good times are all gone,. And I'm bound for moving on.. I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.. Still I wish you'd change your mind. If I asked you one more time,. But we've been through that a hundred times or more..

from hank to hendrix,From Hank to Hendrix. I walked these streets with you. Here I am with this old guitar. Doin' what I do.. I always expected. That you should see me through. I never believed in much. But I believed in you.. Can we get it together. Can we still stand side by side. Can we make it last. Like a musical ride?. From Marilyn to Madonna. I always loved your smile. Now we're headed for the big divorce. California-style.. I found myself singin'. Like a long-lost friend. The same thing that makes you live. Can kill you in the end.. Can we get it together. Can we still stand side by side. Can we make it last. Like a musical ride?. Sometime it's distorted. Not clear to you. Sometimes the beauty of love. Just comes ringin' through.. New glass in the window. New leaf on the tree. New distance between us. You and me.. Can we get it together. Can we still walk side by side. Can we make it last. Like a musical ride?. .
fuckin' up,"Mindless drifter on the road. Carry such an easy load. It's how you look, and how you feel. You must have a heart of steel.. Why do I keep fuckin' up?. I can see you on a hill. Comatose but walking still. Curves beneath your flowing gown. Only I could bring you down.. Why do I keep fuckin' up?. Dogs that lick and dogs that bite. Hounds that howl through the night. Broken leashes are all over the floor. Keys left hanging in a swinging door.. Why do I keep fuckin' up?. Keep fuckin' up!. ."

Well, I worked so hard I flunked out of school. And everybody said I was a teenage fool. Meanwhile I wrote me a new set of rules. 'Bout how to get gone and how to be cool.. Well, we hit the road like a ton o' bricks. With an old guitar and a few hot licks. We were rockin' in the city and rockin' in the sticks. Didn't make much money but we had a lotta kicks.. Get gone, get gone. Get gone, oh yeah, get gone. Get gone, get gone. Get gone, oh yeah, get gone.. Well, then one day a city slicker walked up. Said, Son, I'm gonna make you a million bucks. Gonna fly around the country in a big ol' plane. Gonna get a lotta drugs, gonna feel no pain.. Well, I knew we were breakin' that highway rule. When we pulled outta town a little low on fuel.

Please see for me if her hair hangs long. If it rolls and flows all down her breast. Please see for me if her hair hangs long. That's the way I remember her best. I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all. Many times I've often prayed. In the darkness of my night. In the brightness of my day. So if you're travelin' in the north country fair. Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline. Remember me to one who lives there. She once was a true love of mine"

glimmer,"When I'm riding down the road in my car. Traveling without you. I can still see you sittin' there, right by my side. With the headlights of the oncoming cars. Flashing in the windshield. There's a glimmer of everything that I once saw in you. Tough love can leave you almost alone. But new love brings back everything to you. All the feelings in you heart come re-awakened. Like a forest without leaves on its trees. standing in the desert. Like the light that still leaks through. when you close the door. Like the changes in our life that hits so hard. That day I couldn't find you. There's a glimmer of everything good. that once came before. Tough love can leave you almost alone. But new love brings back everything to you. All the feelings in you heart come re-awakened. And there's a glimmer of everything good. that once came before. There's still a glimmer of everything that I first saw in you"

goin' back,In a foreign land. There were creatures at play. Running hand in hand. Leading nowhere to stay. Driven to the mountains high. They were sunken in the cities deep. Livin' in my sleep.. I feel like goin' back. Back where there's nowhere to stay. When fire fills the sky. I'll still remember that day. These rocks I'm climbin' down. Have already left the ground. Careening through space.. I used to build these buildings. I used to walk next to you. Their shadows tore us apart. And now we do what we do. Driven to the mountains high. Sunken in the cities deep. Livin' in our sleep.. I feel like goin' back.
goin' home,"GOIN' HOME. On the hill where Custer was making his last stand. With the Indians all around and his gun in his hand. Such a wind was blowing that day through the battleground. I could feel it in my hair as I turned towards downtown. Weaving through the buildings, cutting though the streets. Slicing through the culture, piling on the weeks. Going home, I'm going home. Going home, I'm going home. Going home. Dropping in on you, my friend, is just like old times. Said the fool who signed the paper to assorted slimes. It's hard to get blood from a stone but for you I'll give it a try. To provide your accommodations and leave you satisfied. You'd think it was easy to give your life away. To not have to live up to the promises you made. Going home, I'm going home.. Going home, I'm going home.. Going home.. Elusively she cut the phone and moved from cell to cell. Really looking remarkable and obviously doing well. She made a turn on a wooden bridge into the battleground. With a thousand warriors on the ridge, she tried to turn her radio down. Battle drums were pounding all around her car. She saw her clothes were changing into sky and stars. Going home, I'm going home. Going home, I'm going home. Going home, I'm going home. Going home, I'm going home. Going home"

I can't reach out and touch you. You're hung up on the line. I'm your disconnected number now. And you're a private line.. Well, I used to be so happy,. When you gave good 'phone.. I could call you up from anywhere. For a little bit of home. But now my heart is aching. After every call. By the way you talk you'd think. You never gave good 'phone at all.. Let your fingers do the walking. Call me up some time. I'm listed under Broken Hearts. Looking for a good time.. I can't reach out and touch you. You're hung up on the line. I'm your disconnected number now. And you're a private line.. Let your fingers do the walking. Call me up some time. I'm listed under Broken Hearts.. Looking for a good time..

grandpa's interview,"""Grandpa, here's your coffee"". said Edith, as she filled his cup. ""Nobody'll find you here. and Earl is glad you guys showed up"". "" The way things are downtown. you might have to stay for awhile. There was a helicopter hovering over your house. when I talked to your neighbor, Kyle"". ""Who the hell do they think they are. Invading our home like that?. Grandma and I had to leave so fast. We couldn't even catch the cat"". ""The helicopter scared the shit out of him. and it took off down a trail. down past the railroad track. towards the county jail"". ""Jed, you really screwed up now!. What did you have to do that for?. Everybody wants to hang your ass. and here's a note from Lenore"". Sun touched the cold steel bars. as she pushed the paper in. Jed took it up and read it. and he couldn't hide a grin. Outside the jail window. a crow flew across the sky. completely disappearing behind each bar. then a helicopter flew by. ""Say hi to Earl and Edith. Tell 'm I'm doing fine. Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now. they should cut the line"". ""Can grandma come and see me?. I got a new song to sing. it's longer than all the others combined. and it doesn't mean a thing"". The noise was unfamiliar. generators whirling. walkie-talkies screaming. vans parked in the open field. TV crews and cameras. they wanted to interview grandpa on the porch. They came through the gate and across the lawn. knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch. And grandpa saw them there. looking through the venetian blind. ""Those people don't have any respect. so they won't get any of mine"". ""I don't wanna talk about Jed. I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9. I don't have time to talk that fast. and it ain't my crime"". ""It ain't a privilege to be on TV. and it ain't a duty either. The only good thing about TV. is shows like 'Leave it to Beaver"". ""Shows with love and affection'. like mama used to say. A little Mayberry living. could go a long way"". He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet. loaded up both barrels. Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off. and up walked a woman named Carol. ""Susan Carol from Early Magazine. I got some questions to ask"". ""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine! "". grandpa said with a gasp. Then he fell face first and let out a sigh. and Edith ran out in shock. He was looking at her from down on the floor. Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk. ""That guy just keeps singin'!. Can somebody shut him up?. I don't know for the life of me. where he comes up with that stuff. "". They laid his head on a newspaper. with a picture of Carmichael on the front page. posing with the little league baseball team. and a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle. Grandpa died a hero. Trying to stop the media. Fighting for freedom of silence. Trying to be anonymous. Share your loving and you live so long. Share your loving and you live so long. Share your loving and you live so long"
grey riders,"The night was cold. And the wind was howling. I was awaken by the sound. Of hoof beats pounding.. Outside the window, on the ground. Our hound dog was growling. Grey Riders flew across my lawn. I looked again and they all were gone.. That voice was calling. And it cut through the night. Come on boys, let her go.. Up on a hill. They rode in one long column. They were freezing with the chills. Of the new day dawning.. Their hair long and grey. They heard just one voice calling. Grey Riders on the morning sky,. The sun made diamonds of their road-weary eyes.. That voice is calling. And it cut through the night. Come on boys, let her go.. The night was cold. And the wind was howling. I was awaken by the sound. Of hoof beats pounding.. Outside the window, on the ground. Our hound dog was growling. Grey Riders flew across my lawn. I looked again and they all were gone..

Spotlights flashed on a silver cape. And a blue-haired lady screamed. He was the King. The last time I saw Elvis. He was fronting a three-piece band. Rocking on the back of a flatbed truck. With an old guitar in his hand. He was the King. The last time I saw Elvis. The last time I saw Elvis. He was riding in a pink Cadillac. Wind was blowing through his hair. And he never did look back. He was the King. Thank you very much. The last time I saw Elvis. He was singing that gospel song. You could tell that he had the feeling. And the whole world sang along. He was the King.

here we are in the years,Now that the holidays have come. They can relax and watch the sun. Rise above all. of the beautiful things. They've done.. Go to the country take the dog. Look at the sky without the smog. See the world laugh. at the farmers feeding hogs. Eat hot dogs.. What a pity. That the people from the city. Can't relate to the slower things. That the country brings.. Time itself is bought and sold.. The spreading fear of growing old. Contains a thousand foolish games. That we play.. While people. planning trips to stars. Allow another boulevard to claim. A quiet country lane. It's insane.. So the subtle face is a loser. This time around.. Here we are in the years. Where the showman. shifts the gears. Lives become careers. Children cry in fear. Let us out of here!.

hippie dream,Take my advice. Don't listen to me. It ain't paradise. But it used to be. There was a time. When the river was wide. And the water came running down. To the rising tide. But the wooden ships. Were just a hippie dream. Just a hippie dream.. Don't bat an eye. Don't waste a word. Don't mention nothin'. That could go unheard. 'Cause the tie-dye sails. Are the screamin' sheets. And the dusty trail. Leads to blood in the streets. And the wooden ships. Are a hippie dream. Capsized in excess. If you know what I mean.. Just because it's over for you. Don't mean it's over for me. It's a victory for the heart. Every time the music starts. So please don't kill the machine. Don't kill the machine. Don't kill the machine.. Another flower child goes to seed. In an ether-filled room of meat-hooks. It's so ugly. So ugly.. .

hitchhiker,When I was a hitchhiker on the road. I had to count on you. But you needed me to ease the load. And for conversation too. Or did you just drive on through.. You didn't see me in Toronto. When I first tried out some hash. Smoked some then and I'll do it again. If I only had some cash. Only had some cash.. Then I tried amphetamines. And my head was in a glass. Taped underneath the speedometer wires. Of my '48 Buick's dash.. But I knew that wouldn't last.. Then came California. Where I first saw open water. In the land of opportunity. I knew I was getting hotter. I knew I was getting hotter.. But the neon lights. And the endless nights. The neon lights. And the endless nights. The neon lights. And the endless nights. The neon lights. And the endless nights. They took me by surprise. The doctor gave me valium. But I still couldn't close my eyes. I still couldn't close my eyes.. Then came paranoia. And it ran away with me. I couldn't sign my autograph. Or appear on TV. Or see or be seen. See or be seen. Or see or be seen.. Living in the country. Sounded good to me. Smoking grass while the summer lasts. In the real organic sea. Where everything was green. Everything was green.. Then we had a kid and we split apart. I was living on the road. A little cocaine went a long long way. To ease that different load. But my head did explode. My head did explode.. I wish I was an Aztec. Or a runner in Peru. I would build such beautiful buildings. To house the chosen few. Like an Inca from Peru.. When I was a hitchhiker on the road. I had to count on you. But you needed me to ease the load. And for conversation too. Or did you just drive on. Did you just drive on. Did you just drive on through.. Or did you just drive on. Did you just drive on. Did you just drive on through..

i wonder if i care as much,"(chorus). I wonder if I care as much. As I did before. Last night I cried myself to sleep. For the one that makes me weep. I dried my eyes to greet the day. And wondered why I have to pay. The tears that I have shed by day. Give relief and wash away. The mem'ry of the life before. I wonder if I'll suffer more. (chorus). I wonder if I care as much. As I did before. My pride is made to say forgive. And take the blame for what you did. It's your mistake I'm thinkin' of. I wonder if I'm still in love. My heart can't thrive on misery. My life it has no destiny. When things get more. Than I can bear. I ask myself ""do I still care? "". (chorus). I wonder if I care as much. As I did before"

Down the dusty road. To the forest church. Let wander there. Let me wonder why. On the ocean wave. In the billowing sky. Let wander there. Let me wonder why.. Let the angels ring the bells. In the holy hall. Let them hear the voice that calls.. For the love of man. Who will understand. It's alright. But I wonder why.. I wonder why.. I wonder why.. I wonder why..

And I'll protect you from the things that come. I'm glad I found you. The other day when you took my hand. We walked away to the promised land. When I feel your soul in mine. I'm glad I found you. Glad I found you in this sad world. Where so many things have gone wrong. It took me so long just to find you. Right where we belong. I'm glad I found you in this mad world. You're a lifeline to me. And when I hold you I will shield you. From the things that we both see. So many people don't understand. What it's like to be like me. But I'm not different from anyone else. I'm glad I found you.

i'm the ocean,I'm an accident. I was driving way too fast. Couldn't stop though. So I let the moment last. I'm for rollin'. I'm for tossin' in my sleep. It's not guilt though. It's not the company I keep. People my age. They don't do the things I do. They go somewhere. While I run away with you. I got my friends. And I got my children too. I got her love. She's got my love too. I can't hear you. But I feel the things you say. I can't see you. But I see what's in my way. Now I'm floatin'. Cause I'm not tied to the ground. Words I've spoken. Seem to leave a hollow sound. On the long plain. See the rider in the night. See the chieftain. See the braves in cool moonlight. Who will love them. When they take another life. Who will hold them. When they tremble for the knife. Voicemail numbers. On an old computer screen. Rows of lovers. Parked forever in a dream. Screaming sirens. Echoing across the bay. To the old boats. From the city far away. Homeless heroes. Walk the streets of their hometown. Rows of zeros. On a field that's turning brown. They play baseball. They play football under lights. They play card games. And we watch them every night. Need distraction. Need romance and candlelight. Need random violence. Need entertainment tonight. Need the evidence. Want the testimony of. Expert witnesses. On the brutal crimes of love. I was too tired. To see the news when I got home. Pulled the curtain. Fell into bed alone. Started dreaming. Saw the rider once again. In the doorway. Where she stood and watched for him. Watched for him. I'm not present. I'm a drug that makes you dream. I'm an aerostar. I'm a cutlass supreme. In the wrong lane. Trying to turn against the flow. I'm the ocean. I'm the giant undertow. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the giant undertow. I'm the ocean. I'm the giant undertow. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean. I'm the ocean

Do you think that. she'd like to do anything. I would, or would she leave me?. Lately I've found myself. losing my mind. Knowing how badly I need her. It's something hard to find.. What if she came to me. Would she be kind?. And if she stayed with me. Do you think that she'd. like to do anything. I would, or would she leave me?. If I could have her tonight. Does she want to go?. Look at those eyes. Does she want it?. If I could have her tonight. If I could have her tonight. If I could have her tonight."
if i don't know,"If I don't know what I'm doin'. And all my big ideas fail. Like build a dam against the water so the river dies. Veins, the Earth's blood. And if I don't know what I'm sayin'. And all the world's dreams come true. Like finding oil and shooting poison in the ground. Veins, Earth's blood. And if the melodies stay pretty. And the songs are not too long. I'll try to find a way to get them back to you. Veins, the Earth's blood"
if you could read my mind,"If you could read my mind love. What a tale my thoughts could tell. Just like an old time movie. 'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well. In a castle dark or a fortress strong. With chains upon my feet. You know that ghost is me. And I will never be set free. As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see. If I could read your mind love. What a tale your thoughts could tell. Just like a paperback novel. The kind that drugstores sell. When you reach the part. Where the heartaches come. The hero would be me. But heroes often fail. And you won't read that book again. Because the ending's just too hard to take. I'd walk away like a movie star. Who gets burned in a three way script. Enter number two. A movie queen to play the scene. Of bringing all the good things out in me. But for now love, let's be real. I never knew I could act this way. And I've got to say that I just don't get it. I don't know where we went wrong. But the feelin's gone. And I just can't get it back. If you could read my mind love. What a tale my thoughts could tell. Just like an old time movie. 'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well. In a castle dark or a fortress strong. With chains upon my feet. But stories always end. And if you read between the lines. You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand. The feelin's that we lack. I never thought I could feel this way. And I've got to say that I just don't get it. I don't know where we went wrong. But the feelin's gone. And I just can't get it back"
if you got love,When you walk in a room. You hold your head up high. You talk to people eye to eye. There's nothing to hide. You're feeling so complete inside. Your heart feels so complete inside. 'Cause you got love.. If you got love. You know you got it. If you got love. Can't live without it. If you got love. The world you're walking in. Is at your command. You're staring in the face of scorn. You know your spirit can't be torn. You're living like a satellite. Maintain your distance through the night. You know that something isn't right. Your heart tells you it's just not right. 'Cause you got love.. If you got love. You know you got it. If you got love. Can't live without it. If you got love. The world you're walking in. Is at your command.. If you got love. The world you're walking in. Is at your command. If you got love. To share. If you got love. To share..
inca queen,"Once there was an Inca Queen. She gazed at her sundial. All around her workers raised. Golden idols to her smile. The waiting years weren't hard to see. Behind the tears of Mercury.. She spoke of silver from the sky. And many floating safety boats. To pick them up when they would fly. Far above their dreams and hopes. And they a mountain city raised. Where their queen above the clouds. Could watch out.. Inca Queen has, Inca Queen has, Inca Queen has come. Inca Queen has, Inca Queen has, Inca Queen has come.. Out in the jungle the drums were heard: Inca Queen has come. From the biggest elephant to the smallest bird: Inca Queen has come. She spoke of silver from the sky, Inca Queen has come. To pick them up when they would fly, Inca Queen has come.. Once there was an Inca Queen. She gazed at her sundial. All around her workers raised. Golden idols to her smile. And though the air was thin and cold. Soon the day would come the queen had told.. Inca Queen has, Inca Queen has, Inca Queen has come.."
indian givers,There's a battle raging on the sacred land. Our brothers and sisters have to take a stand. Against us now for what we all been doing. On the sacred land there's a battle brewing. I wish somebody would share the news. Now it's been about 500 years. We keep taking what we gave away. Just like what we call Indian givers. It makes you sick and gives you shivers. I wish somebody would share the news. Big money going backwards and ripping the soil. Where graves are scattered and blood was boiled. When all who look can see the truth. But they just move on and keep their groove. I wish somebody would share the news. Saw Happy locked to the big machine. They had to cut him loose and you know what that means. That's when Happy went to jail. Behind big money justice always fails. I wish somebody would share the news. Bring back the days when good was good. Lose these imposters in our neighborhood. Across our farms and through our waters. All at the cost of our sons and daughters. Our brave songs and daughters. We're all here together fighting poison waters. Standing against the evil way. That's what we have at the end of day. I wish somebody would share the news
interstate,"Children are laughing in the sun. I count the voices one by one. But I'm not there to share the fun. I'm out on the interstate. I can hear a soft voice calling. Calling me to bring my guitar home. I'm happy singing in a crowd. The lights are bright, the music's loud. I like to look in every face. But out on the interstate. I can hear a soft voice calling. Calling me to bring my guitar home. Out in the dusty desert wind. The fox goes looking for a friend. She sees a light around the bend. I'm out on the interstate. I can hear a soft voice calling. Calling me to bring my guitar home"
it's a crime of the heart,"When I think about love. Honey, you always come across my mind. Is it the way that you hold me. Or the way that you told me love is blind. Well, it's a crime of the heart. These things I'm thinking to myself. But I can't forget you, babe. Just can't seem to think of nothing else.. Got a woman at home. A family to feed. Three fine children. They think the Lord of me. Now I'm standing at the crossroads. Looking for a sign of true love.. Well, I heard that song. Says girls just wanna have fun. Well, I guess I bought my ticket, honey. 'Cause it feels as if the ride has just begun. Well, there's two kinds of love. One is wrong and one is right. But I can't forget you baby. Can't forget the way you hold me tight.. I got a woman at home. A family to feed. Three fine children. They think the Lord of me. Well, I'm standing at the crossroads. Looking for a sign of true love.. When I think about women. Honey, you always come across my mind. Is it the way that you told me. The way you told me love is blind. Well, it's a crime of the heart. These things I'm thinking to myself now. Can't forget you, babe. Can't forget the way you make me feel.. I got a woman at home. A family to feed. Three fine children. At the crossroads."
it's a dream,In the morning when I wake up and listen to the sound. Of the birds outside on the roof. I try to ignore what the paper says. And I try not to read all the news. And I'll hold you if you had a bad dream. And I hope it never comes true. 'Cause you and I been through so many things together. And the sun starts climbing the roof. It's a dream. Only a dream. And it's fading now. Fading away. It's only a dream. Just a memory without anywhere to stay. The Red River stills flows through my home town. Rollin' and tumblin' on its way. Swirling around the old bridge pylons. Where a boy fishes the morning away. His bicycle leans on an oak tree. While the cars rumble over his head. An aeroplane leaves a trail in an empty blue sky. And the young birds call out to be fed. It's a dream. Only a dream. And it's fading now. Fading away. It's only a dream. Just a memory without anywhere to stay. An old man walks along on the sidewalk. Sunglasses and an old Stetson hat. The four winds blow the back of his overcoat away. As he stops with the policeman to chat. And a train rolls out of the station. That was really somethin' in its day. Picking up speed on the straight prairie rails. As it carries the passengers away. It's gone. Only a dream. And it's fading now. Fading away. Only a dream. Just a memory without anywhere to stay. It's a dream. Only a dream. And it's fading now. Fading away. It's only a dream. Just a memory without anywhere to stay. It's a dream. Only a dream. And it's fading now. Fading away
it's so hard to wait,I just can't seem to get movin'. Love me enough to begin. And I'll never forget you. I hope that you care. More than a little for me. It's so hard to wait.. If I should stand and stare. Don't be alarmed at me. It's so hard to wait.. I just can't seem to get movin'. Love me enough to begin.

last of a dying breed,"Well I hate to say the farmer was the last of a dying breed. Living off the land and taking what he needs. Don't say much for the future when a family can't survive.

Yeah they wanna feed the world, but for power and for greed. Then they'll cut off the supply until they get what they need. Well I dreamed I saw a dustbowl where the farmers used to live. Earth was flying thru the sky, it had nothing left to give. Tractors were burning on the White House lawn. Just woke up one morning and the farmers all were gone. Well I hate to say the farmer was the last of a dying breed. Living off the land and taking what he needs. Don't say much for the future when a family can't survive.

leave the driving,"Out on the old coast highway. Flying through the night. Jed got stopped by the CHP. For speedin' and no brake lights. Rolled down the driver's window. Slipped his gun down under his seat. The glove-box was full of cocaine. The trunk was full of weed. ""Driver's license and registration,"". Said the officer with his flashlight. Search around the floor, look hard. Smellin' like something ain't right. Jed's life flashed before him. Like a scratchy old super-8. He heard the sound of the future. On an RPM 78. Nothing was still, all was moving. When the flashlight found the gun. Then Jed pulled the trigger. In a split-second tragic blunder. ""It makes you think about living. What life has to tell,"". Said Jed to Grandpa. From inside his cell. Camouflage hung in his closet. Guns all over the wall. Plans for buildings and engineers. And a book with no numbers at all. The whole town was stunned. They closed the coast highway for twelve hours. No one could get in. Jed was one of ours. Meanwhile across the ocean. Living in the internet. Is the cause of an explosion. No one has heard yet. But there's no need to worry. There's no reason to fuss. Just go on about your work now. And leave the drivin' to us. And we'll be watching you. No matter what you do. And you can do your part. By watchin' others too. Grandpa put down the paper. Staring in disbelief. Jed had always been good to him. Never gave him any grief. The moral of this story. Is try not to get too old. The more time you spend on earth. The more you see unfold. And as an afterthought. This must, too, be told. Some people have taken pure bullshit."

Let me hear you whisper that you love me too.. Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true.. Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you.. Longing for you all the while, More and more;. Longing for the sunny smile, I adore;. Birds are singing far and near, Roses blooming ev'rywhere. You, alone, my heart can cheer; You, just you.. Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you.. Let me hear you whisper that you love me too.. Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true.."

let's impeach the president,Let’s impeach the president for lying. And leading our country into war. Abusing all the power that we gave him. And shipping all our money out the door. He’s the man who hired all the criminals. The White House shadows who hide behind closed doors. And bend the facts to fit with their new stories. Of why we have to send our men to war. Let’s impeach the president for spying. On citizens inside their own homes. Breaking every law in the country. By tapping our computers and telephones. What if Al Qaeda blew up the levees. Would New Orleans have been safer that way. Sheltered by our government’s protection. Or was someone just not home that day?. Let’s impeach the president. For hijacking our religion and using it to get elected. Dividing our country into colors. And still leaving black people neglected. Thank god he’s racking down on steroids. Since he sold his old baseball team. There’s lot of people looking at big trouble. But of course the president is clean. Thank God
let's roll,I know I said I love you. I know you know its true. I got to put the phone down. And do what we got to do. Oneâ€™s standing in the aisle way. Two more at the door. We got to get inside there. Before they kill some more. Time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll. Time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll. . No time for indecision we got to make a move. I hope that we're forgiven for what we got to do. How this all got started Iâ€™ll never understand. Hope someone can fly this thing and get us back to land. Time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll. Time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll. No one has the answer but one thing is true. You got to turn on evil when itâ€™s coming after you. You gotta face it down and when it tries to hide. We gotta go in after it and never be denied. Time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll. Lets roll for freedom. Lets roll for love. Going after Satin on the wings of a dove. Lets roll for justice. Lets roll for truth. Lets not let our children grow up fearful in their youth. Time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll. Time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll.
life in the city,"People sleepin' on the sidewalks. On a rainy day. Families livin' under freeways. It's the American way. Starvin' in the city. While the farm goes to seed. Murder in the home. And crime on the streets.. Don't that trouble you brother?. Don't that trouble you pal?. Don't that trouble you sister?. Well, that's life in the city.. All our old hangouts. Are boarded up and closed. Or being sold to someone. Nobody knows. I got a woman that loves me. And I love her so. She's all dressed up now. With nowhere to go.. Don't that trouble you brother?. Don't that trouble you pal?. Don't that trouble you sister?. Well, that's life in the city.. That's life in the city.. Listen to me people. Hear what I have to say. Ever since I was knee high. I rocked my blues away. But people sleepin' on the sidewalks. And families in need. Murder in the home. And crime on the streets.. Don't that trouble you brother?. Don't that trouble you pal?. Don't that kill you sister?."
light a candle,Instead of cursing the darkness. Light a candle for where we're goin'. There's something ahead worth looking for.. When the light of time is on us. We will see our moment come. and the living soul inside will carry on.. It's a chance to give new meaning. to every move we make. Through the caverns in the caves. where we come from.. When the light of dawn is on us. We will see what we can be. and the ancient ones can sleep an easy sleep.. In the hallways of the ages. on the road to history. What we do now will always be with us. It's a chance to give new meaning. to every move we make. In the caverns in the caves. where we come from.. Instead of cursing the darkness. Light a candle for where we're goin'. There's something ahead worth looking for.. When the light of time is on us. We will see our moment come. and the living soul inside will carry on.. Light a candle in the darkness. so others might see ahead. Light a candle in the darkness when you go.

I want to love you but I get so blown away.. I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream,. You could have been anyone to me.. Before that moment you touched my lips. That perfect feeling when time just slips. Away between us on our foggy trip.. You are like a hurricane. There's calm in your eye.. And I'm gettin' blown away. To somewhere safer where the feeling stays.. I want to love you but I'm getting blown away.. You are just a dreamer, and I am just a dream.. You could have been anyone to me..

Says that Detroit can't make good cars any more.. Motor City.. Who's driving my car?. Who's driving my car now?. Who?. My army jeep is still alive. Got locking hubs and four wheel drive. Ain't got no radio, ain't got no mag wheels. Ain't got no digital clock. Ain't got no clock.. The paint job is lookin' blue. The white walls are missing too. But I guess until I get my car back. This will do.. Who's driving my car now?. Who's driving my car now?. Who?. Who's driving my car now?."

mr. disappointment,"Where did all the feelings go?. What about that happy glow?. Was that so long ago. When we were first in love?. I didn't feel the change. Everything was still the same. And when that moment came. I didn't know. I miss the feeling. I miss the light. But I got faith in something. I'll never give up the fight. Why's it so heavy, this love of mine?. I lost the feeling, I lost the time. I'd like to shake your hand, Disappointment.. Looks like you win again. But this time might be the last. Let's say I got a habit. Let's say it's hard to break. Let's say we got to do something. Before it's just too late. I want to get you back. I don't know how to do that. I miss you loving me. The way you used to. I'm taking the blame myself. For livin' my life in a shell. And now I'm breakin' out. But will you still be there?. Let's say that love is blind. Let's say that time is kind. Let's say that it's not over 'til it's over. I'd like to shake your hand, Disappointment.. Looks like you win again. But this time might be the last. I'm saving the best for last. Let's leave this all in the past. The beauty of loving you. Is what we've both been through. So now it's up to me. To set your spirit free. So you can swing again on our gate. I'd like to shake your hand, Disappointment.. Looks like you win again. But this time might be the last"
mr. soul,"Oh, hello Mr. Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason. For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season. Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'. I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on.. I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter. I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her. Any girl in the world could have easily known me better. She said, You're strange, but don't change, and I let her.. In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?. Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster. For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster. Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?."
music arcade,Have you ever been lost. Have you ever been found out. Have you ever felt all alone. At the end of the day. Yeah I'm talkin' bout gettin' down. Take it easy - there's no one around. Just a mirror and you and me. And the TV sky. I was walkin down main street. Not the sidewalk but main street. Dodgin' traffic with flyin' feet. That's how good I felt. Took a spin in the laundromat. Played a game in the music arcade. Kept winnin' while the band played. That's how good I felt. (chorus). Have you ever been singled out. By a hungry man. You're listening to the radio. He's washin' your window. When you look in those vacant eyes. How does it harmonize. With the things that you do?. That's how good I felt. (chorus). There's a comet in the sky tonight. Makes me feel like I'm alright. I'm movin' prety fast. For my size. I really didn' mean to stay. As long as I have.

It's not too late, it's not too late. I've got to get somewhere. This time I will take the lead somehow. This time you won't have to show me how. When dreams come crashing down like trees.

my hometown,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand. Into the bus stop. To pick up a paper for my old man. I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and. Steer as we drove through town. He'd tousle my hari and say son take a. good look around this is your hometown. This is your hometown. This is your hometown. This is your hometown. In '65 tension was running high, at my high school. There was a lot of fights between the black and white. There was nothing you could do. Two cars at light on a Saturday night. In the back seat there wasa gun. Words were passed, in a shotgun blast. Troubled times had come, to my hometown. My hometown. My hometown. My hometown. Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores. Seems like there ain't nobody. Wants to come down here no more. They're closing down the textile mill. across the railroad tracks. Foreman says these jobs are going boys. And they ain't coming back to your hometown. Your hometown. Your hometown. Your hometown. Last night me and Kate we laid in bed. talking about getting out. Packing up our bags and maybe heading south. I'm 35, we got a boy of our own now. Last night I sat him up, behind the wheel. And said son take a goold look around. This is your hometown"

A natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to nature.. Amazon. You had so much and now so much is gone. What are you gonna do. With your life?. What a lucky man..

A natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to nature. Don't start yourself too short, my love. Or someday you might find your soul endangered. A natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to nature.. Went to the rodeo today. I saw the cowgirls lined up on the fence. A brand new Chevrolet. A brand new pair of seamless pants.. We watched the moment of defeat. Played back over on the video screen. Somewhere deep inside. Of my soul.. A natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to nature.. ."
needle of death,"When sadness fills your heart. And sorrow hides the longing to be free. When things go wrong each day. You fix your mind to 'scape your misery. Your troubled young life. Had made you turn. To a needle of death. How strange, your happy words. Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone. How tears have filled the eyes. Of friends that you once had walked among. Your troubled young life. Had made you turn. To a needle of death. One grain of pure white snow. Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain. In peace your mind withdraws. Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain. Your troubled young life. Had made you turn. To a needle of death. Your mother stands a'cryin'. While to the earth your body's slowly cast. Your father stands in silence. Caressing every young dream of the past. Your troubled young life. Had made you turn. To a needle of death. Through ages, man's desires. To free his mind, to release his very soul. Has proved to all who live. That death itself is freedom for evermore. And your troubled young life. Will make you turn. To a needle of death"

night song,"Tell me where. Does it say. When you're lost you stay that way. Why a forest of fools getting in the way. Cannot hear, cannot fade with the nightsong. Nightsong, from my heart. Why can't we. Sing this nightsong. All alone. I reflect on my demons in the night. Some are wise. Some are good. Some are not so bright. I can't hear. Sing along with the nightsong. Nightsong, from my heart. Why can't we. Sing this nightsong. Why not keep on singing anyway?. Run away. I don't know what it was. Led you astray. Just because you're too much like I am anyway.

no more,"Livin' on the edge of night. You know the sun won't go down slow. You don't know which drug is right. Can't decide which way you wanna go. I feel the way you feel. 'Cause not so long ago. It had a hold on me. I couldn't let it go. It wouldn't set me free. It wouldn't set me free. No more, no more, no more.. Seemed like the easy thing. To let it go for one more day. Like singin' the same old song. And twistin' the words. In a different way. Where did the magic go. I searched high and low. I can't find it no more. I can't get it back. I can't find it no more. I can't find it no more. No more, no more, no more, no more.. Searchin' for quality. Havin' to have the very best. Now scroungin' for quantity. Never havin' time. To do the test.

no wonder,"See the bluebird fly easy as a dream. Dipping and bobbing in the sun. Could she be the one I saw so long ago. Could she be the one to take me home. This pasture is green. I'm walking in the sun. It's turning brown. I'm standing in the rain. My overcoat is worn. The pockets are all torn. I'm moving away from the pain. Tick-tock. The clock on the wall. No wonder we're losing time. Ring, ring. The old church bell. The bride and her love. Seeking guidance from above. Amber waves of grain bow in the prairie wind. I'm hearing Willie singing on the radio again. That song from 9/11 keeps ringing in my head. I'll always remember something Chris Rock said. Don't send no more candles. No matter what you do. Then Willie stopped singing. And the prairie wind blew. The green kept rolling on. For miles and miles. Fields of fuel rolling on for miles. Tick-tock. The clock on the wall. No wonder we're losing time. Toll, toll. The fallen soldier bell. The old church on the hill. Still standing when so many fell. Back when I was young, the birds blocked out the sun. Before the great migration south. We only shot a few. They last the winter through. Mother cooked them good and served them up. Somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair. Behind a big wooden desk. The caribou we killed mean nothing to him. He took his money just like all the rest. Tick-tock. The clock on the wall. No wonder we're losing time. Ring, ring. Ring the wedding bells. The bride takes the ring. And the happy people sing"
nothing is perfect,"There's plenty of food on the table. Lots of love in the house. The children all do what they're able to do. We got so much to be happy about.. I got a woman standing beside me. She really knows how to stand by her man. She's strong and she's soft and she's honest to me. She really helps me to be a good man.. But nothing is perfect in God's perfect plan. Look in the shadow to see. He only gave us the good things so we'd understand. What life without them would be.. There's plenty of wheat on the prairies. Lots of coal in the mines. We got soldiers so strong they can bury their dead. And still not go back shooting blind.. There's women and men on the workforce. Doing forty hours plus overtime. So the hostages held at the airport. Can come home to something worthwhile.. But nothing is perfect in God's perfect plan. Look in the shadow to see. He only gave us the good things so we'd understand. What life without them would be.. And there's plenty of food on the table. Lots of love in the house. The children all do what they're able to do.

nowadays clancy can't even sing,"Who's that stomping all over my face?. Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace?. Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung. And taking my gypsy before she's begun. To singing the meaning of what's in my mind. Before I can take home what's rightfully mine.. Joinin' and listenin' and talkin' in rhymes. Stoppin' the feeling to wait for the times.. Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,. 'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.. And who's all hung-up on that happiness thing?. Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings?. And who's in the corner and down on the floor. With pencil and paper just counting the score?. And who's trying to act like he's just in between?. The line isn't black, if you know that it's green.. Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see. Who's coming on like he wanted to be.. Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,. 'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.. And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five?. Who's got the feeling that he came alive,. Though havin' it, sharin' it ain't quite the same. It ain't no gold nugget, you can't lay a claim. Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor. There it is baby, don't you worry no more. Who should be sleepin', but is writing this song. Wishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damned wrong.. Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,."

ordinary people,"In a dusty town a clock struck high noon, two men stood face to face.. One wore black and one wore white, but of fear there wasn't a trace.. Two hundred years later two hot rods drag through the very same place,. And a half a million people. Moved in to pick up the pace, a factory full of people.. Makin' parts to go to outer space, a train load of people.. They were aimin' for another place, out of town people.. There's a man in the window with a big cigar, says everything's for sale.. The house and the boat and the railroad car, the owner's gotta go to jail.. He acquired these things from a life of crime, now he's selling them to raise his bail.. He was rippin' off the people.. Sellin' guns to the underground, tryin' to help the people.. Lose their ass for a piece of ground, rippin' off the people.. Skimmin' the top when there was no one around, tryin' to help the people.. He was dealing antiques in a hardware store but he sure had a lot to hide.. He had a backroom full of the guns of war and a ton of ammunition besides.. Well, he walked with a cane, kept a bolt on the door with five pit bulls inside,. Just a warning to the people. Who might try to break in at night, protection from the people.. Selling safety in the darkest night, tryin' to help the people.. Get the drugs to the street all right, ordinary people.. Well, it's hard to say where a man goes wrong, might be here and it might be there.. What starts out weak might get too strong, if you can't tell foul from fair.. But it's hard to judge from an angry throng of hands stretched into the air,. The vigilante people.. Takin' law into their own hands, conscientious people.. Crackin' down on the druglord's land, government people.. Confiscatin' all the dealer's land, patch-of-ground people.. Down at the factory, they're puttin' new windows in.. The vandals made a mess of things, and the homeless just walked right in.. Well, they worked here once, and they live here now, but they might work here again,. They're ordinary people.. And they're livin' in a nightmare, hard workin' people.. And they don't know how they go there, ordinary people.. And they think that you don't care, hard workin' people.. Down on the assembly line, they keep puttin' the same thing out.. But the people today, they just ain't buyin', nobody can figure it out.. Well, they try like hell to build a quality end, they're workin' hard without a doubt,. They're ordinary people.. And the dollar's what it's all about, hard workin' people.. But the customers are walkin' out, Lee Iacocca people.. Yeah, they look but they just don't buy, hard workin' people.. Two out of work models and a fashion slave try to dance away the Michelob night.. The bartender poured himself another drink, while two drunks sat watchin' the fight.. The champ went down, then he got up again, and then he went out like a light,. He was fightin' for the people.. But his timing wasn't right, for Las Vegas people. Who came to see a Las Vegas fight, high rollin' people.. Takin' limos though the neon night, fightin' for the people.. And then a new Rolls Royce and a company car they went flyin' down the street.. Each one tryin' to make it to the gate before employees manned the fleet.. The trucks full of products for the modern home, set to roll out into the street. Of downtown people.. Tryin' to make their way to work, nose-to-the-stone people.. Some are saints, and some are jerks, hard workin' people.. Stoppin' for a drink on the way to work, alcoholic people.. Yeah Yeah, they're takin' it one day, one day at a time.. Out on the railroad track, they're cleanin' up number nine.. They're scrubbin' the boiler down, well, she really is lookin' fine.. Awe, she's lookin' so good, they're gonna bring her back on line,. Ordinary people.. They're gonna bring the good things back, nose-to-the stone people.. Put the business back on track, ordinary people.. I got faith in the regular kind, hard workin' people,. Patch-of-ground people.. ."
out of control,"Once high on a hill. There was a song. Nothing was wrong. That's when time stood still. Now lovers are caught. Left in their thoughts. Tied to their dreams. Bound by the depth of their love. If I can't hold on to you. If I can't hold on to you. There'll be a sky of fire and hell of blue. If all of our dreams won't come true. I'll cover you, I'll cover you. Sky is fire, Hell is blue. That's why I'm out of control. Build myself up, tear myself down. Build myself up again. I'm talking to you. Trying to get through. Don't wanna hide. Lost in the mirror of love. If I can't hold on to you. If I can't hold on to you. If the sky is wide and heavens good. If all of our dreams won't come true. I'll cover you, I'll cover you. Sky is fire, Hell is blue. Somewhere near the end. Lovers pretend. Lose what they feel. Keep what they get from love. Start missing the drive. Staying alive. Four out of Five. Without the feeling of love. If I can't hold on to you. If I can't hold on to you. If this heart is fire and hell is blue. If all of our dreams won't come true."
out of my mind,"Out of my mind. And I just can't take it anymore. Left behind. By myself and what I'm living for. All I hear are screams from outside the limousines. That are taking me. Out of my mind. Through the keyhole in an open door. Happy to find. That I don't know what I'm smiling for. Tired of hanging on,. If you've missed me, I've just gone. Cause they're taking me. Out of my mind. Out of my mind. And I just can't take it anymore. Left behind. By myself and what I'm living for. All I hear are screams from outside the limousines. That are taking me. Out of my mind."
out on the weekend,"Think I'll pack it in and buy a pick-up. Take it down to L.A.. Find a place to call my own and try to fix up.. Start a brand new day.. The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up. But I'm so down today. She's so fine, she's in my mind.. I hear her callin'.. See the lonely boy, out on the weekend. Trying to make it pay.. Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and. Can't begin to say.. She got pictures on the wall, they make me look up. From her big brass bed.. Now I'm running down the road trying to stay up. Somewhere in her head.. The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up. But I'm so down today. She's so fine she's in my mind.. I hear her callin'.. See the lonely boy, out on the weekend. Trying to make it pay.. Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and. Can't begin to say.. ."
over and over,"At night when the sky is clear and the moon is shining down. My heart goes running back to you. I love the way you open up and let me in. So I go running back to you,. Over and over again.. Over and over again my love. Over and over again with you. Over and over again my love. Over and over again with you.. Remember the nights of love and that moment on the beach. That wasn't really too long ago. But we paid the price of time, and now it's out of reach. And so the broken circle go,. Over and over again. Over and over again my love. Over and over again with you. Over and over again my love. Over and over again with you.. Somewhere in a fire of love, our dreams went up in smoke. We danced beneath silver rain. Upon the fields of green, where time was just a joke. And now the feeling's just the same,. Over and over again.. Over and over again my love. Over and over again with you. Over and over again my love."
pardon my heart,"It's a fallen situation. When all eyes are turned in. And a love isn't flowing. The way it could have been.. You brought it all on. Oh, but it feels so wrong. You brought it all on. No, no, no, I don't believe this song. You brought it all on.. It's a sad communication. With little reason to believe. When one isn't giving. And one pretends to receive.. You brought it all on. Oh, but it feels so wrong. You brought it all on. No, no, no, I don't believe this song. You brought it all on.. Pardon my heart. If I showed that I cared. But I love you more than moments. We have or have not shared.. You brought it all on. Oh, and it feels so good. You brought it all on. When love flows the way that it should. You brought it all on.. It feels so good. It feels so good."
passenger,"I'm just a passenger on this old freight train. I ride the boxcar through the night. I doesn't matter where I might get off. I doesn't matter where I lie.. I've been to cities, I've been to countries. I've left a lover in many towns. I don't care if I ever get back to. Where I'd already been around.. I'm like an eagle, I like to fly high. I'm like a snake, I like to lay low. I'm like a black man, I'm like a white man. Maybe a red man, I don't know.. I'm just a passenger on this old freight train. I ride the boxcar through the night. I doesn't matter where I might get off."

I never hear my record on the radio.. Well, here's three thousand, that ought to get it on.. Well, thanks a lot man! I love your new song.. Payola blues. No matter where I go. I never hear my record on the radio.. And it goes like this.. I got a brand new record company, new manager too.. Got a great new record, I can't get through to you.. Payola blues. No matter where I go. I never hear my record on the radio.. How about this new Mercedes Benz, that ought to get it on.. Well, thanks a lot man! I'll play it all day long.. Payola blues. No matter where I go. I never hear my record on the radio.. I've got the payola blues, payola blues. I'm paying those payola blues. No matter where I go."
peace and love,Some lyrics by Eddie Vedder.. . Peace and love. Flying so high. Peace and love. Too young to die. Peace and love. Now you decide. Stay for the children. You don't really want to go. Can't feel it pulling like you did. Peace and love. Peace and love. Only a ride. Strength is gone. Dying inside. Tell me now. What did you find. Found love in the people. Livin' in a sacred land. Found love in the people. Peace and love. . Found love (found ...?). Saw my mistake. Broke walls of pain to walk again. I saw the dream. I saw the wake. We shared it all. But not the take. Peace and love. Lennon's goodbye. Over Now. Living in time. A broken bell. A nursery rhyme. Deserted by heroes. Strangers in your own land. No way to deny you. No way to deny you. Peace and love. I took it all. I took the oath. I took it all. Til I had most. I took what's left. I gave it breath. I had it all once. I gave it back.
peace of mind,"You know it takes a long, long time. You know it takes a long, long time. You love her so and still you know. That you will never want to let her go. Unless you leave her first. Then you come out on top. But, still there's just one thing. You haven't got.. Peace of mind. Like when you treated her kind. It's hard to face that open space.. You know it takes a long, long time. You know it takes a long, long time. When first you gave and shared your soul. Showed her all those things that take their toll. She knows your weak spot. But, she still gets you hot. So you do it again. Reveal what lies within.. And go for peace of mind. Like when you treated her kind. It's hard to face that open space.. You're lookin' for peace of mind. Anywhere you can find. Still searchin' for peace of mind.. You know it takes a long, long time."
peaceful valley boulevard,"One day shots rang across the peaceful valley. God was crying tears that fell like rain. Before the railroad came from Kansas City. And the bullets hit the bison from the train. Shots rang across the peaceful valley. White man laid his foot upon the plain.. The wagon train rolled through the dusty canyon. The settlers full of wonder as they crossed. A gentle creek where two old oaks were standing. Before the west was won there was a cost. A rain of fire came down upon the wagons. A mother screamed and every soul was lost.. Change hit the country like a thunderstorm. Ancient rivers soon began to boil. People rushed like water to California. At first they came for gold and then for oil. Fortunes were made and lost in lifetimes. Mother earth took poison in her soil.. An electro cruiser coasted towards the exit. And turned on Peaceful Valley Boulevard. ""People make the difference"" read a billboard. Above a long line of idling cars.. Who'll be the one to lead this world. Who'll be the beacon in the night. Who'll be the one to lead this world. Who'll be the beacon in the night. Who'll be the one to lead the nations. And protect God's creations. A polar bear was drifting on an ice floe. Sun beating down from the sky. Politicians gathered for a summit. And came away with nothing to decide. Storms thundered on, his tears of falling rain. A child was born and wondered why."
people on the street,"People on the street need a place to go. People on the street need a place to go. Walkin' with the beat if it's not too slow. Walkin' with the beat if it's not too slow. When the night's dark shadow falls. On the sidewalk scenes and the concrete canyon walls.. People on the street need a place to go. People on the street need a place to go.. Walkin' through the night up and down the avenue. Lookin' for a place,. A place to go,. A place to go.. There's a muffled scream from the alley scene. From the alley scene comes a muffled scream. And the siren wails while the system fails. In the steaming heat people walk in the street. People can't run and hide. If you want to feel good then you gotta feel good inside.. People on the street need a place to go. People on the street need a place to go.. Rising through the grates come the fumes of industry. Floating to the sky. Keep walkin' with the beat, walkin' with the beat. Keep walkin' with the beat, walkin' with the beat. Keep walkin' with the beat, walkin' with the beat. When the night's dark shadow falls. On the sidewalk scenes and the concrete canyon walls.. People on the street need a place to go. People on the street need a place to go.."

piece of crap,Tried to save the trees. Bought a plastic bag. The bottom fell out. It was a piece of crap. Saw it on the tube. Bought it on the phone. Now you're home alone. It's a piece of crap. I tried to plug in it. I tried to turn it on. When I got it home. It was a piece of crap. Got it from a friend. On him you can depend. I found out in the end. It was a piece of crap.

pocahontas,"Aurora borealis. The icy sky at night. Paddles cut the water. In a long and hurried flight. From the white man to the fields of green. And the homeland we've never seen.. They killed us in our tepee. And they cut our women down. They might have left some babies. Cryin' on the ground. But the firesticks and the wagons come. And the night falls on the setting sun.. They massacred the buffalo. Kitty corner from the bank. The taxis run across my feet. And my eyes have turned to blanks. In my little box at the top of the stairs. With my Indian rug and a pipe to share.. I wish a was a trapper. I would give thousand pelts. To sleep with Pocahontas. And find out how she felt. In the mornin' on the fields of green. In the homeland we've never seen.. And maybe Marlon Brando. Will be there by the fire. We'll sit and talk of Hollywood. And the good things there for hire. Like the Astrodome and the first tepee. Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me. Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me"
powderfinger,"Look out, Mama, there's a white boat comin' up the river. With a big red beacon, and a flag, and a man on the rail. I think you'd better call John,. 'Cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail. And it's less than a mile away. I hope they didn't come to stay. It's got numbers on the side and a gun. And it's makin' big waves.. Daddy's gone, my brother's out hunting in the mountains. Big John's been drinking since the river took Emmy-Lou. So the Powers That Be left me here to do the thinkin'. And I just turned twenty-two. I was wonderin' what to do. And the closer they got,. The more those feelings grew.. Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassurin'. He told me, Red means run, son, numbers add up to nothin'. But when the first shot hit the docks I saw it comin'. Raised my rifle to my eye. Never stopped to wonder why.. Then I saw black,. And my face splashed in the sky.. Shelter me from the powder and the finger. Cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger. Think of me as one you'd never figured. Would fade away so young. With so much left undone. Remember me to my love,. I know I'll miss her.."
prairie wind,"Trying to remember what my daddy said. Before too much time took away his head. He said we're going back and I'll show you what I'm talking about. Going back to Cypress River, back to the old farmhouse. (Prairie wind blowing through my head). (Prairie wind blowing through my head). (Trying to remember what Daddy said). (Prairie wind blowing through my head). I tried to tell the people but they never heard a word I say. They say there's nothing out there but wheat fields anyway. Just a farmer's wife hanging laundry in her back yard. Out on the prairie where the winds blow long and hard. (Prairie wind blowing through my head). (Prairie wind blowing through my head). (Trying to remember what Daddy said). (Prairie wind blowing through my head). Late at night, lights dancing in the northern sky. Like the Indian spirits trying to show me how to fly. You can see into the future but it may be a mirage. Like a new car sitting there in your old garage. (Prairie wind blowing through my head). (Prairie wind blowing through my head). (Prairie wind blowing through my head). (Trying to remember what Daddy said). There's a place on the prairie where evil and goodness play. Daddy told me all about it but I don't remember what he said. It might be afternoon and it might be the dead of night. But you'll know when you see it 'cause it sure is a hell of a sight.

pressure,"A funny thing happened yesterday. I felt the pressure in a brand new way. It kept hitting me from all directions. I got this feeling I was cracking up.

prime of life,"Shadows climb up the garden wall. Upon the green the first leaf falls. It's the prime of life and the king and queen. Step out into the sun, (Oh yeah). Are you feeling all right. Not feeling too bad myself. Are you feeling all right, my friend?. Footsteps run down the castle hall. To the rooms of the paper doll. It's the prime of life, where the spirit grows. And the mirror shows both ways (Oh yeah). Are you feeling all right. Not feeling too bad myself. Are you feeling all right, my friend?. When I first saw your face. It took my breath away. When I first saw your face. It took my breath away. Shadows fly up the garden wall. Upon the green the first leaf falls. It's the prime of life and the king and queen. Step out into the sun (Oh yeah). Are you feeling all right. Not feeling too bad myself."

psychedelic pill,Party girl's got her shiny dress on. Look at those party moves. She's lookin' for a good time. She loves to dance and she loves the action. Wherever the party goes.

pushed it over the end,"Good lookin' Milly's got a gun in her hand. But she don't know how to use it.. Sooner or later she'll have to take a stand. And she ain't about to lose it.. All the towns people gather around. They've come to see what's going down. Although no one hears a sound. There's another poor man falling down.. Falling down, falling down.. Falling down, falling down.. On this lazy shore. Standing at the edge of you.. Could those dreams of yours be true. Or did you, did you, did you. Pushed it over the end?. How much time did you spend?. Pushed it over the end.. Good lookin' Milly's into politics now. And things are looking much better. She keeps ten men in her garage. Knitting her fine sweaters.. At the end of a weary day. She feels hard and she looks hard.. Although no one hears a sound. There's another poor man falling down.. Falling down, falling down.. Falling down, falling down.. I came back for more. And found you waiting at the door. And far inside your walls I called. Did you, did you, did you. Pushed it over the end?. How much time did you spend?. Pushed it over the end.. How much love did you spend?. Pushed it over the end.."

Now they are feeling fine. Every morning comes the sun. And it goes rising to the day. Holding on to what they've done. He loves her so. He loves her so. He loves her so. He does what he has to. He loves her so. He loves her so. He loves her so. He does what he needs to. [Solo]. Seem like lately things are changing. Seems like lately things are going south. A few drinks now and she hardly knows him. He just looks way and shuts out. And when she says ""it's time to do something"". Maybe talk to his old friends who gave it up. He just pours himself another tall one. Closes his eyes and says ""that's enough"". Every morning comes the sun. And it goes rising to the day. Holding on to what they've done. She loves him so.

say hello to chicago,"When the blues moved north, to Chicago they came. And I caught some myself in this blind alley and rain. Close to the L with it's clattering train. Near an old ornate theater where I soon will be playing. I soon will be playing. So I said hello for you, when I saw a stylish girl. Walking by on the sidewalk with her hair in a swirl. From the wind that was growing at the end of the day. And I wondered what would be coming my way. What would be coming my way, coming my way. You know I been to Chicago, I was here once before. And the rain kept on pounding outside the stage door. I was singing and drinking with love in my heart. I was younger and stronger while life played it's part. While life played it's part, life played it's part. Life played it's part. Let us not be strangers if we come to know. Things about each other that seem to come and go. 'Cause friendship is everything if love is to last. And I have my guard down and love passes fast. Love passes fast, love passes fast. Love passes fast. Say hello to Chicago. Say hello to Chicago. Say hello to Chicago. Say hello to Chicago"

scenery,Looking at the grave. At the scenery around you. Home of the brave. Sometimes they leave you like they found you. Sometimes they worship you. Sometimes they tear your houses down. Sometimes they comfort you. Sometimes they spread your life around. Nothing you can see. That they won't try to give you. Land of the free. Where the legend will outlive you. When you earn their trust. When you are truly in danger. Where greed and lust. Have never been a stranger. . Home of the brave. That's where heroes need protection. Media images slaves. Live by random selection. You sell your heart. But that's not the price of freedom. Where things are useful. Only when you need them. Where will you go. When you need to make some changes. Who will you love. In a world of constant strangers. I'll go with you. If you want to take a hero home. I'll stay behind. If you want to take a hero home. Looking at the grave. At the scenery around you. Home of the brave. Sometimes they leave you like they found you. . Home of the brave. Home of the brave. Home of the brave. Home of the brave. Home of the brave.

And I stood at the crossroads. I'll love you tomorrow. As sure as the wind blows. Silver rain. On the mountain clover. Washes away. Until the music is over..
sedan delivery,"Last night I was cool at the pool hall. Held the table for eleven games. Nothing was easier than the first seven. I beat a woman with varicose veins.. She stopped to see herself in the mirror. Fix her hair and hide heir veins. And she lost the game.. Next day I went to the dentist. He pulled some teeth and I lost some blood. We'd like to thank you for the cards you sent us. My wives and I were all choked up.. I recall how Caesar and Cleo. Made love in the Milky Way. They needed boats and armies to get there. I know there's a better way.. I saw the movie and I read the book. But when it happened to me. I sure was glad I had what it took. To get away.. Gotta get away, gotta get away. Gotta get away, gotta get away. I'm making another delivery. Of chemicals and sacred roots. I'll hold what you have to give me. But I'll use what I have to use.. The lasers are in the lab. The old man is dressed in white clothes. Everybody says he's mad. No one knows the things that he knows.. No one knows, no one knows. No one knows, no one knows. I'm sleepin' in every hallway. I just can't accept the stares. I'm using too many covers. I'm warm now so I don't care.. I'm thinkin' of no one in my mind. Sedan delivery is a job I know I'll keep. It sure was hard to find.. Hard to find. hard to find. Hard to find. hard to find."

shock and awe,"Back in the days of shock and awe. We came to liberate them all. History was the cruel judge of overconfidence. Back in the days of shock and awe. . Back in the days of ""mission accomplished"". Our chief was landing on the deck. The sun was setting on a golden photo op. Back in the days of ""mission accomplished"". . Thousands of bodies in the ground. Brought home in boxes to a trumpet's sound. No one sees them coming home that way. Thousands buried in the ground. . Thousands of children scarred for life. Millions of tears for a soldier's wife. Both sides are losing now. Heaven takes them in. Thousands of children scarred for life. . We had a chance to change our mind. But somehow wisdom was hard to find. We went with what we knew and now we can't go back. But we had a chance to change our mind."
shots,"Shots. Ringing all along the borders can be heard. Striking out like a venom in the sky. Cutting through the air faster than a bird. In the night.. Children. Are lost in the sand, building roads with little hands. Trying to join their father's castles together again. Will they make it? Who knows where or when. Old wounds will mend?. Machines. Are winding their way along, looking strong. Building roads and bringing back loads and loads. Of building materials. In the night. Men. Are trying to move the borders on the ground. Lines between the different spots that each has found. But back home another scene was going down. In the night.. Lust. Comes creepin' through the night to feed on hearts. Of suburban wives who learned to pretend. When they met their dream's end. In the night.. Shots. I hear shots, I keep hearing shots. I keep hearing shots. I hear shots.. Shots. I hear shots, I keep hearing shots. I keep hearing shots. I hear shots.. But I'll never use your love,. You know I'm not that kind. And so if you give your heart away. I promise to you. Whatever we do. That I will always be true.."
sign of love,"When we go for a little walk,. Out on the land,. When we're just walkin' and holdin' hands,. You can take it as a Sign of Love,. When the winds of fate,. Keep blowin' and we both understand,. Sign of love. It's a sign of love. Sign of love. Sign of love. When we both have silver hair,. And a little less time,. But there still are roses on the vine,.

You were just a girl,. And I was a man,. While the music played,. I watched you dance,. Sign of love. It was a sign of love. Sign of love. Sign of love. Sign of love"

And the rain comes pourin' down on me and mine. 'Cause our kind of love. Never seems to get old. It's better than silver and gold. I used to have a treasure chest. Got so heavy that I had to rest. I let it slip away from me. Didn't need it anyway.. So I let it slip away.. I don't care if the sun don't shine. And the rain comes pourin' down on me and mine. 'Cause our kind of love.

sixty to zero,"All the champs and the heroes. They got a price to pay. They go from sixty to zero. In the split of a hair. They see the face in the window. They feel a shadow out there. They've got the places they can go. They've got the people who stare. They've got to walk in their shoes. They've got to see what they see. They've got the people around them. Getting too much for free. All the pimps and the dealers. All the food they can eat. All the screamers and squealers. When they walk down the street. Yeah.. He's just a rich old man. He never cared for anyone. He likes to count his possessions. He's been a miser from penny one. He never cared for his children. Never cared for his wife. Never made anyone happy. That's the way he lived his life. And one day in the sunshine. He got a bolt from the blue. Unloaded all of his possessions. Sold his investments too. And now he lives with the homeless. Owns 900 hospital beds. He prefers to remain nameless. It's publicity he dreads. Yeah.. There's a judge in the city. He goes to work every day. Spends his life in the courthouse. Keeps his perspective that way. But I respect his decision. He's got a lot on his mind. He's pretty good with the gavel. A little heavy on the fines. One day there was this minstrel. Who came to court on a charge. That he blew someone's head off. Because his amp was too large. And the song he was singin'. Was not for love but for cash. Well, the judge waived the charges. He fingered his mustache. Yeah.. Well, there's a clown in a carnival. He rode a painted horse. He came from somewhere out west. He was very funny of course. But that is not what I noticed. It was the incredible force. With which he held his audience. While he rode on his horse. His jokes were not that off-color. His smile was not that sincere. His show was that not that sensational. Reasons for success were not clear. But he still made big money. One day the circus was his. Now he's married to the acrobat. And they're training their kids. Yeah.. Now the jailhouse was empty. All the criminals were gone. The gate was left wide open. And a buck and fawn. Were eating grass in the courtyard. When the warden walked in. And took a rifle from the prison guard. And said to him with a grin. To shoot those deer would be stupid, sir. We already got 'em right here. Why not just lock the gates and keep them. With intimidation and fear?. But the warden pulled the trigger. And those deer hit the ground. He said Nobody'll know the difference. And they both looked around.. Yeah.. Well, the cop made the showdown. He was sure he was right. He had all of the lowdown. From the bank heist last night. His best friend was a robber. And his wife was a thief. All the children were murderers. They couldn't get no relief. The bungalow was surrounded. When a voice loud and clear. Come out with your hands up. Or we're gonna blow you out of here. There was a face in the window. TV cameras rolled. And they cut to the announcer. And the story was told.. Yeah.. Well, the artist looked at the producer. The producer sat back. He said What we have got here. Is a pretty good track. But we don't have a vocal. And we still don't have a song. If we could get this thing accomplished. Nothin' else could go wrong. So he balanced the ashtray. And he picked up the phone. And said Send me a songwriter. Who's drifted far from home. And make sure that he's hungry. And make sure he's alone. And send me a cheeseburger. And a new Rolling Stone. Yeah.. Well, the Sioux and Dakota. They lost all of their land. And now a basketball player. Is trying to lend them a hand. Maybe someday he'll be president. He's quite a popular man. But now the chief has reservations. And the white man has plans. There's opposition in Congress. The bill is up against cash. There's really no way of predicting. If it will fly or it will crash. But that's the nature of politics. That's the name of the game. That's how it looks in the tepee. Big winds are blowing again. Yeah.. There's still crime in the city. Said the cop on the beat. I don't know if I can stop it. I feel like meat on the street. They paint my car like a target. I take my orders from fools. Meanwhile some kid blows my head off. Well, I play by their rules. So now I'm doing it my way. I took the law in my own hands. Here I am in the alleyway. A wad of cash in my pants. I get paid by a ten year old. He says he looks up to me. There's still crime in the city. But it's good to be free. Yeah.. Now I come from a family. That has a broken home. Sometimes I talk to my daddy. On the telephone. When he says that he loves me. I know that he does. But I wish I could see him. Wish I knew where he was. But that's the way all my friends are. Except maybe one or two. Wish I could see him this weekend. Wish I could walk in his shoes. But now I'm doin' my own thing. Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad. Although my home has been broken. It's the best home I ever had. Yeah.. Well, I keep getting younger. My life's been funny that way. Before I ever learned to talk. I forgot what to say. I sassed back to my mummy. I sassed back to my teacher. I got thrown out of Sunday School. For throwin' bibles at the preacher. Then I grew up to be a fireman. I put out every fire in town. Put out everything smoking. But when I put the hose down. The judge sent me to prison. Gave me life without parole. Wish I never put the hose down. Wish I never got old.."

slip away,She lives in the TV sky. She lives in such pain. She rides in a bulletproof. Stretch limousine. The smoke in the barroom nights. The faces in the window. The sound of the harbor horn. She recognized. And when the music started. She just slipped away. Just like a river rollin' down. And when the music started. She just slipped away. High on a windy hill. The turbine did whine. Low in the valley chill. A baby was cryin'. Impossible to take the time. The moment is here. Cry out from behind the pines. A voice comin' near. And when the music started. She just slipped away. Just like a river rollin' down. And when the music started.

Try to make it new before you go.. Take the simple case of the serge. Who can't go back to war. 'Cause the hippies tore down everything that he was fighting for.. Or the lovers on the blankets. That the city turned to whores. With memories of green kissed by the sun.. You can say the soul is gone. And close another door. Just be sure that yours is not the one.. And I'm singing for the stringman. Who lately lost his wife. There is no dearer friend of mine. That I know in this life.. On his shoulder rests a violin. For his head where chaos reigns. But his heart can't find a simple way. To live with all those things.. All those things. He's a stringman. A stringman. All those strings to pull. .

sun green,"Sun Green started makin' waves. On the day that Grandpa died. Speakin' out against anything. Unjust or packed with lies. She chained herself to a statue of an eagle. In the lobby of Power Co.. And started yelling through a megaphone,. ""There's corruption on the highest floor."". Suits poured out of elevators. ""You're all dirty."". Phoneheads began to speak. ""You can't trust any of them."". Security couldn't get her down. She was welded to the eagle's beak.. Sun Green leaned into that megaphone, said,. ""Truth is all I seek."". Security brought in some blow torches. News cameras recorded her speech,. ""When the city is plunged into darkness. by an unpredicted rolling blackout. The White House always blames the governor. Saying the solution is to vote him out."". On top of that great bronze eagle. Sun's voice was loud and clear. She said,. ""Power Co's working with the White House. to paralyze our state with fear."". It was a golden moment. In the history of TV news. No one could believe it. It just got great reviews. ""Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too.. Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too.. Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too.. Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too."". The Imitators were playing. Down at Jon Lee's bar. When Sun went down to see â€˜em. Someone followed her in a car. Now when she goes dancin'. She has to watch her back. The FBI just trashed her room. One of them kicked her cat. Damn thing scratched his leg. So he had to shoot it dead. And leave it lyin' in a puddle of blood. At the foot of Sun Green's bed. Jon Lee's was rockin'. The Imitators drove it home. Sun was dancin' up a heat wave. For awhile she was all alone. When up walked a tall stranger. Shadowed her move to move. In perfect unison. A supernatural groove. He took her by the hand. And the room began to spin. He said, ""I'm Earth; Earth Brown.. You know the shape I'm in.. ""I'm leavin' tonight for Alaska. And I want you to come in the spring. And be a goddess in the planet wars. And save the living things.. ""I'm ready to go right now,"". Sun Green told Earth Brown. ""Let's go back to my place,. pick up my cat, and leave this town behind."". ""Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too.. Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too.. Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too.. Hey, Mr. Clean."". Next day Sun Green got busted for pot. And it made the headline news. But then the charges all got dropped. And the story gets confused. â€˜I'd still like to meet Julia Butterfly. And see what remedy brings. And be a goddess in the planet wars. Try to save the living things. ""But that might not be easy. Livin' on the run. Mother Earth has many enemies. There's much work to be done. ""Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too.. Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too..

I am lonely but you can free me. All in the way that you smile. Tell me why, tell me why. Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself,. When your old enough to repay but young enough to sell?.

the old homestead,"Up and down the old homestead. The naked rider gallops through his head. And although the moon isn't full. He still feels the pull.. Out on the floor where the cowboys dance. Approaching slowly at a glance. Here comes the shadow of his stance. The reins are fallin' from his hands.. Why do you ride that crazy horse?. Inquires the shadow with little remorse. Just then a priest comes down the stairs. With a sack of dreams and old nightmares.. Who are you, the rider says. You dress in black but you talk like a Fed. You spout ideas from books that you read. Don't you care about this guy's head?. Just then the sound of hoofbeats was heard. And the sky was darkened by a prehistoric bird. Who flew between the unfulfilled moon. And the naked rider, to a telephone booth.. We'll call the moon and see what's up. I've got some change in this little tin cup. We'll say that the shadow is growin' dim. And we need some light to get back to him. Just one call should do it all. I'll carve this number on the wall. With my beak.. Flying feathers were all around. The air was filled with a ringing sound.. Two more birds, the second and the third. Came down from the sky to deliver the word.. Where have you been, they said to the first. Get back to the clouds, we're dying of thirst. There's not enough time to make that call. Let's ditch this rider, shadow and all.. The sky was filled with the beautiful birds. Still on the ground some crying was heard. With his dime in his hand and his hand on the dial. His ears were sweating as he forced a smile.. Hoofbeats beating across the range. He rode through the night with his cup of change. Tired and beaten he fell into slumber. But up in the sky they still had his number.. Up and down the old homestead. The naked rider gallops through his head. And although the moon isn't full. He still feels the pull,. Still feels the pull.. ."

the road of plenty,"One day a visitor took a trip through my town. We all were dancin' till he took his beat away. Come to think of it, he thought of every last detail. Slipped out late one night. Completely out of sight. Left his message etched into my brain.. And when the gates are closed on The Road of Plenty. The fist comes poundin' down you feel it everyday. It's hard to really know if you are full or empty. Here it comes again. You think I'm your old friend. But now we're not so easily found.. Me and my old Corvette, we were flying through the night. Chasin' my blonde lover down skyline. She saw the tail lights flash to avoid the crash. It was way too late. When I hit the brakes. And we went spinnin' with a screeching sound.. I was talkin' to my friend, tellin' him I lucked out. He smiled at me and said I'm glad you feel that way. And when I wrote that down on a piece of paper. Beneath a garbage heap. Down upon the street. A Mariachi band began to play.. Up in the gold hotel, the money hits the table. The heavies are all there, that's why the deal goes down. With beautiful women all dressed in diamonds and sable. Down upon the street. Beside a garbage heap. A Mariachi band began to play.. In Eldorado town there lives a great bullfighter. His eyes are screamin' blue, his hair is red as blood. And when the gate goes up, the crowd gets so excited. Then he comes dancin' out. Dressed in gold lami. He kills the bull and lives another day.. ."

It's brought a tear and a smile. It's seen its share of dreams and hopes. And never went out of style. The more I play it, the better it sounds. It cries when I leave it alone. Silently it waits for me. Or someone else I suppose. This old guitar. This old guitar. This old guitar. This old guitar has caught some breaks. But it never searched for gold. It can't be blamed for my mistakes. It only does what it's told. It's been a messenger in times of trouble. In times of hope and fear. When I get drunk and seeing double. It jumps behind the wheel and steers. This old guitar ain't mine to keep. It's mine to play for a while. This old guitar ain't mine to keep. It's only mine for a while. This old guitar.

Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away. Remember how we first came here together?. Standing on an empty lot, holding hands. Later, we came back in the moonlight. And made love right where the kitchen is. Then we made our plans. This old house of ours is built on dreams. And a businessman don't know what that means. There's a garden outside she works in every day. And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's. Gonna come and take it all away. Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.

thrasher,"They were hiding behind hay bales,. They were planting in the full moon. They had given all they had for something new. But the light of day was on them,. They could see the thrashers coming. And the water shone like diamonds in the dew.. And I was just getting up, hit the road before it's light. Trying to catch an hour on the sun. When I saw those thrashers rolling by,. Looking more than two lanes wide. I was feelin' like my day had just begun.. Where the eagle glides ascending. There's an ancient river bending. Down the timeless gorge of changes. Where sleeplessness awaits. I searched out my companions,. Who were lost in crystal canyons. When the aimless blade of science. Slashed the pearly gates.. It was then I knew I'd had enough,. Burned my credit card for fuel. Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand. With a one-way ticket to the land of truth. And my suitcase in my hand. How I lost my friends I still don't understand.. They had the best selection,. They were poisoned with protection. There was nothing that they needed,. Nothing left to find. They were lost in rock formations. Or became park bench mutations. On the sidewalks and in the stations. They were waiting, waiting.. So I got bored and left them there,. They were just deadweight to me. Better down the road without that load. Brings back the time when I was eight or nine. I was watchin' my mama's T.V.,. It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode.. Where the vulture glides descending. On an asphalt highway bending. Thru libraries and museums, galaxies and stars. Down the windy halls of friendship. To the rose clipped by the bullwhip. The motel of lost companions. Waits with heated pool and bar.. But me I'm not stopping there,. Got my own row left to hoe. Just another line in the field of time. When the thrashers comes, I'll be stuck in the sun. Like the dinosaurs in shrines. But I'll know the time has come. To give what's mine.. ."
through my sails,"Still glaring from the city lights. Into paradise I soared. Unable to come down. For reasons I'd ignored.. Total confusion,. Disillusion. New things I'm knowin'.. I'm standing on the shoreline. It's so fine out there. Leaving with the wind blowing. But love takes care.. Know me, know me. Show me, show me. New things I'm knowin'.. Wind blowing through my sails. It feels like I'm gone. Leaving with the wind blowing. Through my sails.."
throw your hatred down,Here in the conscious world. We place our theories down. Why man must bring us to our knees. Before he sees the weakness of his sinful plan. The power in his hand. Will never touch a friend. Throw your hatred down. Throw your hatred down. . Meanwhile in the underworld. The weaknesses are seen. By peasants and presidents. Who plan the counter-scheme. Children in the schoolyard. Finish choosing teams. Divided by their dreams. While a TV screams. Throw your weapons down. Throw your weapons down. . The wheel of fortune. Keeps on rollin' down. The street that's paved with sinful plans. There but for circumstance. May go you or I. Dressed in gold lame. Find a place to stay. Throw your hatred down. Throw your hatred down. Throw your hatred down. Throw your weapons down. .

trans am,"Trans Am. The wagons in the valley had pulled up for the night. Seth said ""go get the plow out Merle, this place looks just right"".

He used to ride the Santa Fe before the tracks were laid. Trans Am. A nasty wind was blowing through the gates of Eden Park. One was swinging and one was hanging,. and the street lights all were dark. It crawled along the boulevard with two wheels on the grass. That old Trans Am was dying hard, but still had lots of gas. The golden gate was open wide, the sun came shining through. Where once the angels stood and cried everything was new. Trans Am. Global manufacturing, hands across the sea. The hotel filled with dealers, everything was free. Before the competition, ahead of all the rest. The product was presented, it clearly was the best. The power link was ruptured, the hotel shook and rolled. The old Trans Am just bounced around and took another road. Trans Am. An old friend showed up at the door. The mile posts flying by. He said come on, I said what for. He said I'll show you why. I got a call from north of here. They said some girl's broke down. There's good money in it for you and me.

Yeah, sure looks like we're all gonna rock forever.. Rock, rock, rock.."
weight of the world,I used to carry the weight of the world. On my back. I never trusted my friends or my girl. Can you imagine that. I used to shuffle my feet. When I walked I hung my head down low. Kept to myself all my private thoughts. But when I met you girl.. I dropped the weight of the world. Weight of the world. I dropped the weight of the world. Weight of the world.. I knew some people used to dance all night. But not me. I never knew if it was wrong or right. To be so free. I used to close my eyes. And try to hide from the light of love. Spent all my time with the darkness inside. But when I met you girl.. I dropped the weight of the world. Weight of the world. I dropped the weight of the world. Weight of the world.. I was alone for all of my life. I was alone for all of my life. I was alone for all of my life. I was alone for all of my life. Until you came my way. I dropped the weight of the world. Weight of the world. I dropped the weight of the world. Weight of the world..

western hero,"Frontier town, home of the westren hero. Frontier justice, dealt with the iron hand. He wore a long coat to the ground. He wore big boots that made a sound. He wore a six gun on his hip. But now he doesn't carry it. Sure enough, he was a western hero. On the deck, sighting an old Jap zero. And on the shores at Normandy. He fought for you, he fought for me. Across the land and on the sea. But now he's just a memory. And in the distance, the rocket's red glare. The bombs burst in the air. This time we're never going back. Through the years he changed somehow. He's different now. He's different now. Open fire, here comes the western hero. Standing there, big money in his hand."
what did you do to my life?,When we were living together. I thought that. I knew you would stay.. Still when you left me. I tried to pretend. we could make it some way.. I don't care. if all of the mountains. Turn to dust in the air.. (What did you do to my life?). It isn't fair that I should. Wake up at dawn. And not find you there. (What did you do to my life?). It's hard enough losing. Without the confusion. of knowing I tried.. But you've made your mind up. That I'll be alone. now there's nothing to hide.. I don't care. if all of the mountains. Turn to dust in the air.. (What did you do to my life?). It isn't fair that I should. Wake up at dawn. And not find you there. (What did you do to my life?).

Or every living thing?. When God made me. When God made me. Was he planning only for believers. Or for those who just have faith?. Did he envision all the wars. That were fought in his name?. Did he say there was only one way. To be close to him?. When God made me. When God made me. Did he give me the gift of love. To say who I could choose?. When God made me. When God made me. When God made me. When God made me. Did he give me the gift of voice. So some could silence me?. Did he give me the gift of vision. Not knowing what I might see?.

when i watch you sleeping,When I watch you sleeping. There's nothing that you hide. When I smell you breathing. There's a sweetness from inside. And when I feel you stirring. And the day is about to break. Outside wings are whirring. And the sky is there to take. I wonder how I got so close to you. And see the chances that you take. Without thinking I'm going there too. These are the promises you make. When your eyes are blinded by love. And the history of fate. When I hear you purring. Like a kitten and a lion. And I feel your softness. How you got it without trying. Then you roll and tumble. With your dreams still holding on. And I hear that rumble. In the stomach of the dawn. Today I paint my masterpiece. Tonight I trace my tears. Thinking through the road I took to you. And where I stumbled through the years. Today I paint my masterpiece. Tonight I trace my tears. Thinking through my path to you. And where I stumbled through the years. That's when I knew I'd never hold you down. Repeating old roads and fears. Now the crows are calling. And the blackbirds sing in my ear. You got one eye open. And I'm smiling through my tears. But you'll never see them. Here inside with my fears. In a place that's fading away. And taking on new years

will to love,"It has often been my dream. To live with one who wasn't there. Like an ocean fish who swam upstream. Through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears.. When the water grew less deep.

Got the will to love, the will to love.. I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,. Never lose the will.. It's like something from up above.. I'm like a singer on the stage. With the golden lights and liquid rage. Down from the mountains to the sea. Cool running love keeps cleansing me.. It keeps my gills from getting dry. But it distorts things in my eyes. Sometimes I see what really isn't there. Like my true lover, and I care.. Got the will to love, the will to love.. I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,. Never lose the will.. It's like something from up above.. Sometimes I ramble on and on. And I repeat myself till all my friends are gone. And get lost in snow and drown in rain. And never feel the same again.. I remember the ocean from where I came. Just one of millions all the same. But somewhere someone calls my name. I'm a harpoon dodger, and I can't, won't be tamed.. Got the will to love, the will to love.. I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,. Never lose the will.. It's like something from up above.. Baby, if I see boredom in your eyes. I'll know my river has run dry. But I won't turn back with that lonely tide. I bought that ticket and I'll take that ride.. If we meet along the way. Please sway beside me, let us sway together. Our tails together and our fins and mind. We'll leave this water and let our scales shine. In the sun above and the sky below. So all the water and earth will know. It has often been my dream. To live with one who wasn't there.. ."
