in the ghetto,"As the snow flies. On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'. A poor little baby child is born. In the ghetto. And his mama cries. 'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need. It's another hungry mouth to feed. In the ghetto. So people, don't you understand. The child needs a helping hand. Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day. Take a look at you and me,. Are we too blind to see,. Do we simply turn our heads. And look the other way. Well the world turns. And a poor little boy with a runny nose. Plays in the street as the cold wind blows. In the ghetto. And his hunger burns. So he starts to roam the streets at night. And he learns how to steal. And he learns how to fight. In the ghetto. Then one night in desperation. A young man breaks away. He buys a gun, steals a car,. Tries to run, but he doesn't get far. And his mama cries. As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man. Face down on the street with a gun in his hand. In the ghetto. As her young man dies,. On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',. Another little baby child is born. In the ghetto."

Yes we've travelled day and night for many a poor mile. Now it all makes sense as we see the morning smile"

yesterday's gone,"I heard she loved you, I heard she cared,. I heard she miscarried and you were scared.. Did you run from the one,. Who conceived your child?. Yesterday's gone there's no return,. And she cries all night.. Did you run from the one. Who conceived your child?. Yesterday's done there's no return,. And she cries all night.. Solo.. I believe that a woman can be a slave to a man.. I believe that love that you gave and we try it again.. Will you return to the one,. Who conceived your child?. Yesterday's gone there's no return,. And she cries all night.. Will you return to the one,. Who conceived your child?. Yesterday's done there's no return,. And she cries all night.. Did you run from the one,. Who conceived your child?. Yesterday's gone there's no return,. And she cries all night."
you and me,"I'm not going out tonight. 'cos I don't want to go. I am staying at home tonight. 'cos I don't want to know. You revealed a world to me. and I would never be. Dwelling in such happiness. your gift of purity. Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh x2. Aahh, you and me it will always be. You and me forever be. Eternally it will always be you and me. Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor. I don't pay attention. to the ones who never cared. Find your own direction. 'cos there's sweetness in the air. You will be the world to me. and I will always be. Dwelling in this happiness,. your gift of purity. Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh x2. Aahh, you and me will always be. You and me Forever be. Eternally Will always be. You and me. Always be You and me. Forever be, Eternally. It will always be You and me. Forever be, Eternally. Taylor, Taylor x4."
zombie,"Another head hangs lowly. Child is slowly taken. And the violence caused such silence. Who are we mistaking?. But, you see it's not me. It's not my family. In your head, in your head. They are fighting. With their tanks and their bombs. And their bombs and their guns. In your head in your head they are crying. In your head. In your head. Zombie, zombie, zombie. What's in your head? In your head. Zombie, zombie, zombie. Another mother's breaking. Heart is taking over. When the violence causes silence. We must be mistaken. It's the same old thing since 1916. In your head,. In your head. They're still fighting. With their tanks and their bombs. And their bombs and their guns. In your head, in your head they are dying. In your head, in your head. Zombie, zombie, zombie. What's in your head? In your head. Zombie, zombie, zombie"
