Livin' by your intuition and that ain't right. Face first. In the doghouse. Face first. Would not could not should not, but you did. Don't even try to cross me you snot nosed kid. This fight ain't half way over, you soft skin clown. That ill pill you're selling just wont wash down. I see what you do to others, and what you've done. I can't help but think and wonder when my time will come. So when you go for yours, you better knock me out. You come back to my neighborhood and I'll bust your crown."
all night,"You work like a dog 5 days a week. It sounds bleak. And you feel it's never gonna end. I recommend. That you chill for a sec. Take a deep breath. And think about the weekend. Where you are going to. What you gonna do. You spend 5 days dying. Now live it up for 2. I'm talkin' friday, saturday. Nothin' really matter day. Take it to the limit and recover on sunday!. Paycheck cashed, no responsibility. Free to lose your mind and enjoy the insanity. Time to be lazy. Time to get crazy. Monday morning comes it'll all be hazy. What I say?. No price to pay. From a pawn to a player. And an all night sprayer. Going hard you're the man. Give yourself a big hand. Made it through the week. Now it's off to the promise land. Come on, come on everybody. Let's get together and party. Let's start this party right. Gonna lose your minds tonight. Looking all around the world. Calling all my dogs and girls. If you feel it sing along. Gonna party all night. Now it's time to shine. Let them see how it's done. You need to show the people. What it means to have fun. Get up on the table. If you're willing and able. Prove to everybody that you're mentally unstable. No room for that here. Leave your problems at the door. Let your hair down. Get out on the dancefloor. Nobody staring. Ain't nobody caring. Can't hear anyway. Cause the music is blaring. Now the party's rockin'. And there ain't no stoppin'. And to keep it jumpin'. We need the music pumpin'. Let's get this party started. We'll let you get retarted. We only want to play. So where my dogs at?. Where my girls at?. C'mon, c'mon everybody!"
always the same,"Always the same and that's a shame.. The only change is the name of the game.. I know it sucks, cause times are tuff. and it's ruff but you gotta keep your head up.. What do you want?. I want a shot to follow my dreams, they're all I got.. What do you need?. I need a chance to go for it all cause I got plans.. What do you got?. I got nothing but fire burning inside for all I desire.. What do you see?. All I see is walls obstacles in my way they're gonna fall.. How do you feel?. It's all wrong but if it's not kill me I'm getting strong.. Where do you go?. On that I must decide exhibiting a sense of self.. What is the deal?. Just playing with time, learning alot, trying to get mine.. What do you know?. I don't know why it hurts, but if it's really worth something it takes hard work.."
big wheel,"Yeah it's a big world out there. and most of it is water.. So you better learn how to swim real good. or you should know how to fly this is motion. taking too long, like a bad song, fly to hong kong,. high as the sky without the bong.. Never the less the level of stress was endless,. I felt pressed in the cabin cass business.. I remember what it took to get us here,. the mad years we performed just for the beer.. Now we hover undercover in the atmosphere.. Intergalatic players, true pioneers.. Big wheel, spinnin around,. breaking thru cities and rippin thru town.. Get down time to flip that frown,. keep your body moving from your feet to the crown.. This is the J to the O H to the N C and then I'm on.. I spy like James Bond. N to the OR. I'll put you in the ER,. fumming like a cigar, screaming like a marshall.. Electric guitar starp me in there, a true circle, the perfect square.. Hot like flares, danger, beware you must prepare.. Only strategic affairs turn boys to millionairs.. We got to keep moving/forever staying in motion.. Papa never gave me tools to the trade, yo, I'm tryinta make the grade.. Suckas think I got it made. I won't trade or give aid.. You'll be played like arcades, follow the big wheel wherever it takes,. you nothing, but the truth. You must pursue in the endeavor.. Just remember to yourself be true explore the world.. It's a treasure if you only knew."
buggin',"Maybe I fly too much. Maybe you're high too much. I don't know, but I know. That I'm buggin'. Maybe I think too much. Think maybe you're out of touch. I don't know, but I know. That I'm buggin'. On and on and on it goes. Where it stops nobody knows. Round and round and round again. It feels like this will never end. Maybe I bitch too much. Shut the fzzuck up. I don't know, but I know. That I'm bugging. Maybe I smoke too much. Please put out that butt. I don't know, but I know. That I'm bugging. I'm buggin'."

Got the look of a crook. Now they got the prop. Gassed up head full of lead. Might even drop a cop. Or not, who knows, it could go any way. But fun with a gun the games children play. Why did someone have to be the victim. Of a stupid game you shouldn't be playing. Don't you know that guns aren't for children. I tried to tell you but you didn't listen. The second verse skit is on the hearse tip. Young fingers on triggers and bodies gonna get hit. Lick fe shot's that go bang in the night. Just that quick you know he lost his life. Such a shame that the game. Had to end like that. Body dies mama cries. When the hammer cracks. I know you didn't mean it. The damage is done. It's what you get. Playing with gun, son. Bulletproof - it's a shame. Bulletproof - and you know the game. One mistake, a lifetime of pain. Hell your cell yourself to blame. Bulletproof - no you ain't. Bulletproof - and nobody is. A gun ain't a toy, toys are for kids. Click-clack-pop-pow l."

expect the unexpected,"Now you never know when it's your time. It's always there in the back of your mind. Read it in the paper see it on TV. Never think it could happen to me. Accidents occur we don't know why. Just look what happened to Princess Di. One car crashed and the whole world cried. No time to say goodbye. Won't see your future in a crystal ball. Your psychic friends can't help you at all. Can't buy time at a shopping mall. The writing's on the wall. Struck by lighting, fall in a well. It sounds far fetched but you never can tell. When you're swimming with sharks that you can't repell. No one can hear you yell.... You never know where. You won't know how. When you least expect it. Expect the unexpected. Boom! What a terrible sound. Planes go up, and crash back down. You never thought when you left the ground. That you would not be found. Took a big chance when you made that bet. Laid it on the line now you're starting to sweat. This is one day you'll never forget. Cash in your pockets and no regrets. Fly in the sky, or sail in a boat. It don't matter which way you go. Titanic, don't panic,. There's other ways to cross the Atlantic. Don't be surprised by what you hear. Things aren't always as they appear. The unexpected ain't nothing to fear. The truth is always clear."

games,"Standing up at the plate. Waiting on my date. I was starin' to worry. She was a halt-hour late. My team don't like it. When I delay the game. But they know I'm crowned. The girls on the rebound. Life is like a stadium at night. Crowd cheers jeers. Drama spot lights. The public know us. Maybe they don't. But now I m gonna show 'em. What the cameras won't. Time is running out for you and me. What's it all about ?. When I was a kid. I went down to the minors. For stealing a base. They gave me a shiner. Sat me on the bench. 'til I learned my lesson. Little older, wiser. And a little less aggressive. At the age of 17. I got back on the team. Like a quarterback sneak. Every kid's dream. Never far from home. Always in the zone. Home or away. In ballparks and domes. C'mon and play these games today. Who wants to play these games today. I'm gonna play these games today. We gotta play. Play games."
gangbusters,Back in the old days when gangsters were all the rage. And crime was the front page of news and TV..... A group known to no one who's blows were all low ones. The cops had shit to go on they had no leads..... Drive by shootings. Murders at will.... Pay for protection. Or have yourself killed.... Gangbusters.... Guys like Al Capone who loved being unknown. Made themselves at home and still got away.... The law couldn't catch him or none of his hit men. So he died in prison for taxes unpaid.... Screw prohibition. Crimes go unsolved. Elliot Ness. Couldn't wrap up the mob.... Hey Ho- Who the gangbusters. Hey yo- You the gangbusters. That's Right- We the gangbusters.... Some say crime don't pay but they didn't feel that way. And so I would have to say that I do agree.... The gangbusters in the past proved they were there to last. By knife or shotgun blast for the world to see. Gangbusters.

Top to the bottom, front to back,. all 12 sings of the Zodiac.. Asking everybody from east to west,. y'all wanna know who's style's the best.. Telling all the people in the north and south,. that this is what we're talking about.. If you're not going up,. then you gotta get down.. Put your head in the clouds. and your feet on the ground.. If you're not coming in,. then you gotta get out,. right out, right out, right out.."
rise above,"Rise above. You can rise above. With a little bit of love. Life has taught me one thing. How it is I wanna live. Love has shown another light. Gave me, something to believe in. There is love hate, birth and death. For us all. In these pits do not fall. Rise above. Detachment from the body's needs. Cannot live my life in fear. From my mind I must be free. Free at last I see so clearly. There is wealth, loss, pleasure, pain. In this world. So you know. This will go. Quick as it comes. And like the smoke we rise. You better open your eyes. Cuz your soul can't hide behind the lies. Open up and breathe. You gotta plant the seed. Check the flow of the breath over reed."

sore loser,You tried out for the high school team. So you would have some childhood dreams. That you and your father could share. Football coach said you're too small. Don't even think of basketball. You knew you were destined to fail. Went to the track meet. You wanna be an athlete (sore loser). Get back in your seat they said. Go to the dugout. Three strikes you stuck out (sore loser). And home runs flew over your head. Looking down on rock n' roll. And you dreamed of scoring goals. You're saving those dreams for your bed. Thought it was cool to be a jock. You ended up a rent-a-cop. A dozen donuts in your hand. You're a loser. A sore loser. Now it seems the tables turned. The game of life you should have learned. So try using some of your brains. All your high school friends are stars. Driving really fancy cars. The irony drives you insane.
step right in,"Clap your hands. Stop your feet. Dog Eat Dog said to step right in. Dog Eat Dog said to step right out. Tell me son what the fuck is life about. We search this whole world for love, peace & harmony. But all we found was hate, deceit & jealousy. Dog Eat Dog so come and check the dialogue. Get your brain out of the fog. Vinny Barbarino represent the Sweathogs. All Boro Kings Roadrunner catalog. You could run but you can't get far. No matter where you at, that's where you are. No matter where you from. Don't matter what you do. We got the bangin' beats & you can all get some. It's like a rabid dog infecting you. Explosion I'm moving like motion. I'm gigantic I m deep as the Atlantic Ocean. Feel the force I strike with the iron cross. You're the face of the pale horse. True indeed we plant the seed to infiltrate the. Whole world community. We're taking no slack it's an all out attack. Cuz this time the RZA let us hook the track. Word to god together on a mission. so guard your tape deck were converting stereos. Ded and the RZArecta tell you one more time boy. Protect your neck."
strip song,Start off the day say you wanna play. You don't wanna pay but you wanna stay. Do what you want when you wanna do it. Could of had more but you went and blew it. Now the time has come time to have some fun. Won't see the sun until I'm done. There's one thing before we begin. Get on the table and let me see some skin. Back to the story you know you really bore me. Hard enough to live when you're always horny. I like you you love me. Simple as that it's gotta be. I'm givin' you a chance you better take it. An orgasm you fake it. Something you should know before I'm good to go. We're gonna have sex I gotta see a show.
summertime,"It's been a long cold winter. And now it's time for a change. In the season. It's the reason. When we're rolling to the spring. I'm feeling up clouds are moving out. To make way for the sun. Brings the people out from in the house. They go have some fun. We love the lazy days. The time to play. Together we are one. All the sights and sounds. How we get down. The good times have begun. It's the summer in the city. By the country on the lake. In the mountains and the beaches. Chillin' poolside far away. I love the summer. You love summer too. We love the summer. Yeah we love the summertime. Nothing better than time to chill. Spark the bbq - fire up the grill. Make sure the cooler is filled for real. Than pass me an icecold chill pill, we. Call up the family. Gather all friends. Everyone's invited. So you're welcome to attend. Take as much time as I can spend. 'cus I never want the summer to end. It's the summer in the city. By the country on the lake. In the mountains and the beaches. Chillin' poolside far away. I love the summer. You love summer too. We love the summer. Yeah we love the summertime. When it's hot outside and you feel all right. You love it - we love it. On a blue sky day. If you're riding that wave. You love it - we love it!. Got the radio on - play your favorite song. You love it - we love it!. Hanging out with the friends the party never ends. You love it - we love it!. I love the summer. You love summer too. We love the summer. Yeah we love the summertime"
think,I don't even hear what you say. It's all about what you do. You think you're the mack. I'll tell you a fact. No-one gives a fuck about you. What it is. What is was. And what you always will be. Think. You think you're my friend. You ain't my friend. I hear you talking about respect and clout. You never get a bit. A front or a back. We're gonna smack. Time to flip the script on you kid.
true color,"Gave you all that I had. I let you come and go as you please,. never once did I ask for anything in return,. except to have what was coming to me.. You broke a friendship that was based on trust. and tried to pull the wool right over my eyes.. I can't see how such a lying , cheating son of a bitch,. could have ever been a friend of mine.. Are you so blind that you can't see,. look at what you've done to me.. All of this time I called you my friend,. now I see your true colors showing in the end.. Good times and bad times took a turn for the worst,. but looking back on it now,. wonder why somehow I could ever hitten all the hurts.. Took something from me that you can't give back,. it was yours as much it was mine,. but in the end I think you've got what was coming to you,. I got love you got nothing but time.. Are you so blind that you can't see,. look at what you've done to me.. All of this time I called you my friend,. now I see your true colors showing in the end.. Left you to your own devices. and I see trust is just a word you take for granted,. you never had the balls to stand and fight me.. Cause you know that my feet have been firmly planted.. I always had your back we'd find a way out you know,. the two of us could never be kept down.. I never understand the path you've chosen,. but I will not back down.."
undivided,"We're undivided but undecided. I got questions, is that all there is?. Like how much more blood can a stone give?. If you squeeze it enough. There's been reason enough. To take the good with the tough times. Joy to the rough times. Shit used to be knit. Tighter than cashmere. How did it get all. Where do we go from here?. Just know you're my heart but I've gotta confess. I'm thinking we should give it a rest. We're undivided (I love you to death!). But undecided. I'm staying open to just about anything. But more changes and the song remains the same. Approaching the next chapter with laughter. Hoping for the best but preparing for disaster. Have to self preserve, self pretend, self medicate. You adapt and matriculate to the current situation. Compromise slide thru complications in our relations. You say you're confused boo. Well boy I'm confused too. I'm down for anything in the world involving you. Baby make up your mind and tell me what you wanna do?. Cause I already made my decision about you. We stay positional even when it's critical. I got your back and that's unconditional. Always been together - done it all whatever,. We could make this last forever. Do what you gotta do. It's a crazy world and I'll take my chances with you!"
what comes around,Ear to the ground keep one eye on the clock. The crew that's rising up this time. ain't the N.K.O.T.B.. Don't wanna take a number not gonna. stand in line. Think we're buying all the bullshit. well you're out your fuckin' mind. I only see in front of me. Will you watch my back?. Searching for the guidance such a long time. we have lacked. Land of equality who is number one?. What comes around. goes around hard. What goes around's comin' up harder. Open your mind now hear what I've got to say. People living' off the street growing by the day. Speaking on the numbers I look out for number one. Politics can't fix this mess could a revolution?. I only see in front of me could you watch my back?. These be the times when truth is crime. and lie is fact. People runnin' game to make a name. this one weighs a ton.
whateverman,"Who is the one that don't need a gun. Livin' with the scum in the city slums. Mixin' with the players, bushers and bums. Keepin' it groovy with everyone. Out on the block is where the action's hot. They keep it moving and it just won't stop. The wolves in sheep's clothes, good people with hope. When it's DOG EAT DOG, they go for the throat. I'm your Whateverman, that's just what I am. I'll help you if I can, to come through with your plan. Whateverman that's just what I am. I'll help you if I can to work it out.

who's the king?,"Who's The King?. You're like the King of Rock & Roll. Filled with a soul and all fucked up on Demerol. Like the King. you're only headed for the ground. Your own Graceland, Your body never found. I smell a rat up the back. But no a former champion. The hardest man alive's in an Indiana prison. What does Donnie do about that?. He lets his main man rot. As his pockets grow fat. Don't snooze,ya gotta make your moves. Nobody move, nobody gets hurt. Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt. But still Rodney King got treated like dirt. And why can't we all get along. Why get along with the cops. They beat ya like a dog. Jumpin high with pride. in the red, white & blue. Was it the thrills, the spills. Of the Rocket cycle dude. The King dare devil. Took it to another level,. Evil Knievel, a well paid rebel."
world keeps spinnin',"Just because the earth is round, don't mean you've got the right. To treat it like it was a basketball.. Pass it to the left, shoot it from the right. Destroying it is gonna take it's toll.... Oh no, I don't feel so good.. The world keeps spinning, here comes lunch.. Just because the earth is round, don't mean you got the right. To kick it like it was a soccer ball.. Kick it to the ground, pass it to the sky. Destroying it is gonna take it's toll.... Oh no, I don't feel so good.. The world keeps spinning, here comes lunch.. All the dumping and spilling and burning and killing that's going on all over the globe. How will the dumping and spilling and burning and killing affect us? Nobody knows.. Some wreck the state of the earth, some cry for the sky. It don't make a difference, we're the ones who are gonna die.. Oh no, I don't feel so good.. The world keeps spinning...."
