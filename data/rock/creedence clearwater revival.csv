someday never comes,"First thing I remember was asking papa why. For there were many things I didn't know. And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand. Saying someday you'll understand. Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son. That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young. 'Cause someday never comes. Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust. For there were many things I didn't know. When daddy went away he said ""try to be a man"". And someday you'll understand. Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son. That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young. 'Cause someday never comes. And then one day in April, I wasn't even there. For there were many things I didn't know. A son was born to me; mama held his hand. Saying someday you'll understand. Well I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son. That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young. 'Cause someday never comes. Think it was September, the year I went away. For there were many thing I didn't know. And still I see him standing trying to be a man. I said, someday you'll understand.
