Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal. And I need to be redeemed. To the one I've sinned against. Because he's all I ever knew of love. Heaven help me for the way I am. Save me from these evil deeds. before I get them done. I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand. but I keep livin' this day. like the next will never come. Oh help me, but don't tell me. to deny it. I've got to cleanse myself. of all these lies that I'm good. enough for him. I got a lot to lose and I'm. bettin' high. so I'm beggin' you before it ends. just tell me where to begin. What I need is a good defense. Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal. And I need to be redeemed. To the one I've sinned against. Because he's all I ever knew of love. Let me know the way. before there's hell to pay. Give me room to lay the law and let me go. I've got to make a play. to make my lover stay. So what would an angel say. the devil wants to know. What I need is a good defense. Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal. And I need to be redeemed. To the one I've sinned against. Because he's all I ever knew of love"
container,I was screaming into the canyon. At the moment of my death. The echo I created. Outlasted my last breath. My voice it made an avalanche. And buried a man I never knew. And when he died his widowed bride. Met your daddy and they made you. [Hook:]. I have only one thing to do and that's. To be the wave that I am and then. Sink back into the ocean. Sink back into the o. Sink back into the ocean. Sink back into the o. Sink back into the ocean. Sink back into the ocean

paper bag,"I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star. To pray on, or wish on, or something like that. I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy. Whose reality i knew, was a hopeless to be had. But then the dove of hope began its downward slope. And I believed for a moment that my chances. Were approaching to be grabbed. But as it came down near, so did a weary tear. -I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag. -Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills. Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up. I got to fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold. -hunger hurts, but starving works. When it costs too much to love. And I went crazy again today,. Looking for a strand to climb. Looking for a little hope. Baby said he couldn't stay, wouldn't put his lips to mine,. And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope. I said, ""Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified. Come on put a little love here in my void"" -He said. ""It's all in your head"", and I said ""So's everything"" -. But he didn't get it - I thought he was a man. But he was just a little boy. -Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills. Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up. I got to fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold. -hunger hurts, but starving works. When it costs too much to love. -Hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills.

sleep to dream,"I tell you how I feel, but you don't care. I say tell me the truth, but you don't dare. You say love is a hell you cannot bear. and I say gimme mine back and then go there, for all. I care. Chorus:. I got my feet on the ground and I don't go to sleep. to dream. You got your head in the clouds and you're not at. all what you seem. This mind, this body, and this voice cannot be. stifled by your deviant ways. So don't forget what I told you, don't come around,. I got my own hell to raise. I have never been so insulted in all my life. I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride. First you run like a fool just to be at my side. and now you run like a fool, but you just run to. hide, and I can't abide. Chorus (1x). Don't make it a big deal, don't be so sensitive. We're not playing a game anymore; you don't have to. be so defensive. Don't you plead me your case, don't bother to. explain. Don't even show me your face, cause it's a crying. shame.

valentine,"You didn't see my valentine. I sent it via pantomime. While you were watching someone else. I stared at you and cut myself. It's all I do cause I'm not free. A fugitive too dull to flee.

I root for you, I love you, you -you-you-you. I made it to a dinner date. My teardrops seasoned every plate. I tried to dance, but lost my nerve. I cramped up in my learning curve. I'm a tulip in a cup. I stand no chance of growing up. But I've resolved to sail on through. In the wake of tales of you…. I root for you, I love you, you -you-you-you"

slow like honey,"You moved like honey in my dream last night. Yeah, some old fires were burning. You came near to me and you endeared to me. But you couldn't quite discern me. Does that scare you?.

I’m gonna fuck it up again. I’m gonna do another detour. Unpave my path. And if you wanna make sense. Whatcha looking at me for. I’m no good at math. And when I find my way back,. The fact is I just may stay, or I may not. I’ve acquired quite a taste. For a well-made mistake. I wanna mistake why can’t I make a mistake?. I’m always doing what I think I should. Almost always doing everybody good. Why-. Do I wanna do right, of course but. Do I really wanna feel I’m forced to. Answer you, hell no. I’ve acquired quite a taste. For a well-made mistake, I wanna. Make a mistake, why can’t I make a mistake. I’m always doing what I think I should. Almost always doing everybody good. Why."

We could move in it and I'd soon forget. That what I am is what I am, cause I does what I does. And maybe I'd relax, let my breast shot bust open. My heart's made of parts of all that surround me. And that's why the devil just can't get around me. Every single night's alright, every single night's a fight. And every single fight's alright with my brain. I just want to feel everything.

extraordinary machine,I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes. and I certainly haven't been spreading myself around. I still only travel by foot and by foot it's a slow climb. but I`m good at being uncomfortable so I can't stop changing all the time. I noticed that my opponent is always on the go. and won't go slow so as not to focus and I notice. he'll hitch a ride with any guide as long as they go fast from whence he came. but he's no good at being uncomfortable so he can't stop staying exactly the same. If there was a better way to go then it would find me. I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me. Be kind to me or treat me mean. I make the most of it I'm an extraordinary machine. I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day. You deem me doomed to clean my view and be at peace and lay. I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way. and say I've been getting along for long before you came into the play. I am the baby of the family. it happens so everybody cares. and wear the sheeps clothes while they chaperone. curious you're looking down your nose at me while you appease. curteous to try and help but let me set your mind at ease. If there was a better way to go then it would find me. I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me. Be kind to me or treat me mean. I make the most of it I`m an extraordinary machine. Do I so worry you?. Do I need to hurry to say it's very kind. but it's to no avail. I don't want the veil of flowers to. no everything will be just fine. If there was a better way to go then it would find me. I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me. Be kind to me or treat me mean. I make the most of it I'm an extraordinary machine.

And in its wake appeared the touch and call of a different breed. One who set to get me wise and got me there and then, got me. And what a thing to know what could be instead. Oh what a blessed curse to see. It took the agenda from its place in my bed. Made a merry paramour of me. O' sailor why'd you do it. What'd you do that for. Saying there's nothing to it.

oh well,"What you did to me made me. See myself something different. Though I try to talk sense to myself. But I just won't listen. Won't you go away. Turned yourself in. You're no good at confession. Before the image that you burned me in. Tries to teach you a lesson. What you did to me made me see myself somethin' awful. A voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled. It took me such a long time to get back up the first time you did it. I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems I've been outbidded. My peace and quiet was stolen from me. When I was looking with calm affection. You were searching out my imperfections. What wasted unconditional love. On somebody. Who doesn't believe in the stuff. You came upon me like a hypnic jerk. When I was just about settled. And when it counts you recoil. With a cryptic word and leave a love belittled. Oh what a cold and common old way to go. I was feeding on the need for you to know me. Devastated at the rate you fell below me. What wasted unconditional love. On somebody. Who doesn't believe in the stuff. Oh, well"

pale september,"Pale September, I wore the time like a dress that year. The autumn days swung soft around me, like cotton on my skin. But as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappeared. My heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within. But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full. And sank in the burrows of my keep. And all my armor falling down,. In a pile at my feet. And my winter giving way to warm,. As I'm singing him to sleep. He goes along just as a water lily. Gentle on the surface of his thoughts his body floats. Unweighted down by passion or intensity. Yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts. And he finds a home in me. For what misfortune sows, he knows my touch will reap. And all my armor falling down,. In a pile at my feet. And my winter giving way to warm,. As I'm singing him to sleep. And all my armor falling down,. In a pile at my feet. And my winter giving way to warm,. As I'm singing him to sleep"
paper bag,"I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star. To pray on, or wish on, or something like that. I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy.

But as it came down near, so did a weary tear. -I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag. -Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills. Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up. I got to fold cuz these hands are too shaky to hold. -hunger hurts, but starving works. When it costs too much to love. And I went crazy again today,. Looking for a strand to climb. Looking for a little hope. Baby said he couldn't stay, wouldn't put his lips to mine,. And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope. I said, ""Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified. Come on put a little love here in my void"" -He said. ""It's all in your head"", and I said ""So's everything"" -. But he didn't get it - I thought he was a man. But he was just a little boy. -Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills. Cuz I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up.

sitting in limbo,"Sitting here in limbo, but I know it won't be long. Sitting here in limbo, like a bird without a song. Well they're putting up resistance. But I know that my faith will lead me on. Sitting here in limbo, waiting for the dice to roll. Sitting here in limbo, got some time to search my soul. Well they're putting up resistance. But I know that my faith will lead me on. I don't know where life will lead me. But I know where I've been. I can't say what life will show me. But I know what I've seen. Tried my hand at love and friendship. But all that is passed and gone. This little boy is moving on. Sitting here in limbo waiting for the tide to flow. Sitting here in limbo knowing that I have to go. Well they're putting up resistance. But I know that my faith will lead me on. I don't know where life will lead me. But I know where I've been. I can't say what life will show me. But I know what I've seen. Tried my hand at love and friendship. But all that is passed and gone. This little boy is moving on. Sitting here in limbo waiting for the tide to flow. Sitting here in limbo knowing that I have to go. Well they're putting up resistance. But I know that my faith will lead me on. Sitting in limbo. Sitting in limbo."
sleep to dream,"I tell you how I feel, but you don't care. I say tell me the truth, but you don't dare. You say love is a hell you cannot bear. and I say gimme mine back and then go there, for all. I care. Chorus:. I got my feet on the ground and I don't go to sleep. to dream. You got your head in the clouds and you're not at. all what you seem. This mind, this body, and this voice cannot be. stifled by your deviant ways. So don't forget what I told you, don't come around,. I got my own hell to raise. I have never been so insulted in all my life. I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride. First you run like a fool just to be at my side. and now you run like a fool, but you just run to. hide, and I can't abide. Chorus (1x). Don't make it a big deal, don't be so sensitive. We're not playing a game anymore; you don't have to. be so defensive. Don't you plead me your case, don't bother to. explain. Don't even show me your face, cause it's a crying. shame. Just go back to the rock from under which you came. Take the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you. claim -- and don't forget the blame. Chorus (1x)."
slow like honey,"You moved like honey in my dream last night. Yeah, some old fires were burning. You came near to me and you endeared to me. But you couldn't quite discern me. Does that scare you?. I'll let you run away. But your heart will not oblige you. You'll remember me like a melody. Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you. And my big secret -- gonna win you over. slow like honey, heavy with mood. I'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard. I'll invade your demeanor. And you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze. and you'll wonder what it is about me. It's my big secret -- keep you coming. slow like honey, heavy with mood. Though dreams can be deceiving. like faces are to hearts. they serve for sweet relieving. when fantasy and reality lie to far apart. So I stretch myself across, like a bridge. and I pull you to the edge. And I stand there waiting. trying to attain. the end to satisfy the story. Shall I release you?. Must I release you?. As I rise to meet my glory. But my big secret --. gonna hover over your life. gonna keep you reaching. when I'm gone like yesterday. when I'm high like heaven. when I'm strong like music. Cause I'm slow like honey, and. heavy with mood."
so sleepy,"I'm so sleepy. But it's not my bedtime. We got bells. The bells, the bells. Keep me awake. I'm a gummy bear. I stand up on the chair. And then I start to dance. To dance, to dance. On the groove. But I'm still sleepy. Or am I dreaming?. The bells keep ringing. But I'm awake. I need to be sleeping. 'Cause I'm going to be dodging. In the big game. The bells keep ringing. So keep it down!. Keep it down!. Keep it down!. Keep it down!"
sullen girl,"Days like this, I don't know what to do with myself. all day -- and all night. I wander the halls along the walls and under my. breath. I say to myself. I need fuel -- to take flight. Chorus:. And there's too much going on. but it's calm under the waves, in the blue of my. oblivion. Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion. Is that why they call me a sullen girl -- sullen. girl. They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquil. sea. But he washed me ashore and he took my pearl --. and left and empty shell of me. Chorus (1x). Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion. It's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion."
the child is gone,"Darling, give me your absence tonight. Take the shade from the canvas and leave me the. white. Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside. and don't bother leaving the light on. Cause I suddenly feel like a different person. From the roots of my soul comes a gentle coersion. and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion --. a vacancy that just did not belong. The child is gone. Honey, help me out of this mess. I'm a stranger to myself. But don't reach for me -- I'm too far away. I don't wanna talk cause there's nothing left to say. So my darling, give me your absence tonight. Take all of your sympathy and leave it outside. cause there's no kind of loving that can make this. alright. I'm trying to find a place I belong. And I suddenly feel like a different person. From the roots of my soul comes a gentle coersion. and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion. as the darkness turns into the dawn. The child is gone. The child is gone."
the first taste,"I lie in an early bed, thinking late thoughts. waiting for the black to replace my blue. I do not struggle in your web because it was my aim to get caught. But daddy longlegs,. I feel that I'm finally growing weary. Of waiting to be consumed by you. Chorus:. Give me the first taste. Let it begin -- heaven cannot wait forever. Darling, just start the chase -- I'll let you win. But you must make the endeavor. Oh, your love give me a heart contusion. Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red. Your hungry flirt borders intrusion. I'm building memories on things we have not said. Full is not heavy as empty, not nearly, my love. Not nearly, my love, not nearly. Give me the first taste. Let it begin -- heaven cannot wait forever. Darling, just start the chase -- I'll let you win. But you must make the endeavor"
the way things are,"I wouldn't know what to do with another chance. If you gave it to me. I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance. It'd race right through me. I'm much better off the way things are. Much much better off, better by far, by far. I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice. It'd roll right past me. And if you chalk it up you'll see I don't really have a choice. So don't even ask me. I'm much better off, the way things are. Much much better off, better by far. So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on. And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone. If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle. And as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be. Able to move on. How can I fight, when we're on the same side. How can I fight beside you. So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on. And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone. If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle. And as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be. Able to move on. So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on. And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone. If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle. And as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be. Able to move on"
to your love,"Here’s another speech you wish I’d swallow. Another cue for you to fold your ears. Another train of thought too hard to follow. Chugging along to the song that belongs to the shifting of gears. Please forgive me for my distance. The pain is evident in my existence. Please forgive for my distance. The shame is manifest in my resistance. To your love, to your love, to your love. I would’ve warned you, but really, what’s the point?. Caution could but rarely ever helps. Don’t be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint. It’s hard enough even trying to be civil to myself. Please forgive me for my distance. The pain is evident in my existence. Please forgive for my distance. The shame is manifest in my resistance. To your love, to your love, to your love. My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon. Around you. But by the time I’m close to you, I lose. My desideratum and now you, so. Now you have it, so baby tell me what’s the word?. Am I your gal, or should I get out of town?. I just need to be reassured. Do you just deal it out, or can you deal with. What I lay down?. Please forgive me, for my distance. The pain is evident in my existence. Please forgive me for my distance. The shame is manifest in my resistance. To your love, to your love, to your love."
tymps (the sick in the head song),"Those boon times went bust. My feet of clay, they dried to dust. The red isn't the red we painted. Its just rust. And the signature thing. That used to bring a following. I have trouble now. Even remembering. So why did I kiss him so hard. Late last Friday night. And keep on letting him change all my plans. I'm either so sick in the head. I need to be bled dry, to quit. Or I just really used to love him. I sure hope thats it. I knew that to keep in touch. Would do me deep in dutch. Cuz it isn't the rush of remembering. Its just mush. And the signature thing. Is only growing harrowing. I should have no trouble now. To keep from following. So why did I kiss him so hard. Late last Friday night. And keep on letting him change all my plans. I'm either so sick in the head. I need to be bled dry, to quit. Or I just really used to love him. I sure hope thats it.

ugly girl,"When I saw you at the groccerie store. You were sharin a shopping cart with her. And I couldn’t turn and run away. I didn’t know what to say. You introduced us for the first time. And I had to look her in the eye. But you could not have imagined my surprise. Can’t you see?. You’re leaving me. For an ugly girl. Does she talk about politics?. And all that stuff that used to makes me sick. Does she smoke cigars and stay up late. Oh she’s so great. Does she tell you what you want to hear?. And I bet she could grow a pear. I feel better thinking you`re a queer. It’s not fair. I can’t compare. To an ugly girl. To an ugly girl. Lalalalalala lalalalalalala lalalalalalalala. Lalalalalalala. Lalalalalalalala. Lalalalalala hhahah. Hahaha the jokes on me. I feel jealous and I feel mean. She’s so nice. That it makes up for her face. There’s no way, do you have to keep your eyes closed. Do you have to keep the lights down low?. Oh I bet you wish you had a blind fold. CAN""T (instead of don't) you see you’re leaving me. For an ugly girl. For an ugly girl. She’s an ugly girl. A real ugly girl. Lalalalalalala lalalalalala lalalalalala lalalalalalala. She’s an ugly girl. An ugly girl ahh huhhh. --. letra por Alas°"

valentine,"You didn't see my valentine. I sent it via pantomime. While you were watching someone else. I stared at you and cut myself. It's all I do cause I'm not free. A fugitive too dull to flee. I'm amorous but out of reach. A still-life drawing of peach.. I'm a tulip in a cup. I stand no chance of growing up. I've made my peace, I'm dead, I”m done. I watch you live to have my fun.. I root for you, I love you, you -you-you-you. I made it to a dinner date. My teardrops seasoned every plate. I tried to dance, but lost my nerve. I cramped up in my learning curve. I'm a tulip in a cup. I stand no chance of growing up. But I've resolved to sail on through. In the wake of tales of you…. I root for you, I love you, you -you-you-you"
waltz,"If you don't have a song to sing you're okay. You know how to get along,. humming. mmmm... If you don't have a date, celebrate. Go out and sit on the lawn,. and do nothing. Cause it's just what you must do,. And nobody does it anymore. No I don't believe in the wasting of time,. But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine. If you don't have a point to make,. Don't sweat it. You'll make a sharp one being so kind,. And I'd sure appreciate it. Everyone else's goal's to get big headed. Why should I follow that beacon/beepin' (?). That I'm better than fine. ooohh.."
werewolf,"I could liken you to a werewolf. The way you left me for dead. But I admit that I provided a full moon. And I could liken you to a shark. The way you bit off my head. But then again I was waving around. A bleeding, open wound. But you were such a super guy. 'til the second you get a whiff of me. We are like a wishing well. And a bolt of electricity. But we can still support each other. All we gotta do's avoid each other. Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key. Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key. The lava of the volcano. Shot up hot from under the sea. One thing leads to another. And you made an island of me. And I could liken you to a chemical. The way you made me compound a compound. But I'm a chemical, too, inevitable you and me would mix. And I could liken you to a lot of things. But I always come around. 'Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl, I know the fiction of the fix. But you were such a super guy. 'til the second you get a whiff of me. We are like a wishing well. And a bolt of electricity. But we can still support each other,. All we gotta do's avoid each other. Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key. Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key. Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key. Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key"
why try to change me now?,"I'm sentimental, so I walk in the rain. I've got some habits even I can't explain. Could start for the corner, turn up in Spain. But why try to change me now?. I sit and daydream, I've got daydreams galore. Cigarette ashes, there they go on the floor. Go away weekends, leave my keys in the door. But why try to change me now?. Why can't I be more conventional?. People talk, people stare, so I try. But that can't be, 'cause I can't see. My strange litlle world go passing me by. So, let people wonder. Let 'em laugh, let 'em frown. You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down. Don't you remember I was always your clown?. Why try to change me now?"
window,I was staring out the window. The whole time he was talking to me. It was a filthy pane of glass. I couldn't get a clear view. As he went on and on. It wasn't the outside world I could see. Just the filthy pane that I was looking through. So I had to break the window. It just had to be. Better that I break the window. Than him or her or me. I was never focused on just one thing. My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft. It may looked like I'm concentrated on a very clear view. But I'm as good as asleep. I bet you didn't know. It takes a lot of it away if you do. I had to break the window. It just had to be. Better that I break the window. Than him or her or me. I had to break the window. It just had to be it was in my way. Better that I break the window. Than forget what I had to say. Or miss what I should see. Because the fact being that. Whatever's in front of me is covering my view. So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact. I only see what I'm looking through. So again I've done the right thing. I was never worried about that. The answer's always been in clear view. But even when the window's clean. I still can't see for the fact. That when it's clean it's so clear. I can't tell what I'm looking through. So I had to break the window. It just had to be it was is my way. Better that I break the window. Than him or her or me. I had to break the window. It just had to be it was in my way. Better that I break the window. Than miss what I should see. I had to break the window. It just had to be. It was in my way. Better that I break a window. Then forget what I had to say. Or miss what I should see. Or breaking him/her or me. Especially me
