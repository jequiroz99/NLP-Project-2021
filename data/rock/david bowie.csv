Now the workers have struck for fame. 'Cause Lennon's on sale again. See the mice in their million hordes. From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads. Rule Britannia is out of bounds.

amsterdam,"In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who sings. Of the dreams that he brings. From the wide open sea. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who sleeps. While the river bank weeps. To the old willow tree. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who dies. Full of beer, full of cries. In a drunken town fight. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who's born. On a hot muggy morn. By the dawn's early light. In the port of Amsterdam. Where the sailors all meet. There's a sailor who eats. Only fish heads and tails. And he'll show you his teeth. That have rotted too soon. That can haul up the sails. That can swallow the moon. And he yells to the cook. With his arms open wide. ""Hey, bring me more fish. Throw it down by my side"". And he wants so to belch. But he's too full to try. So he stands up and laughs. And he zips up his fly. In the port of Amsterdam. You can see sailors dance. Paunches bursting their pants. Grinding women to porch. They've forgotten the tune. That their whiskey voice croaked. Splitting the night. With the roar of their jokes. And they turn and they dance. And they laugh and they lust. Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts. And then out of the night. With their pride in their pants. And the sluts that they tow. Underneath the street lamps. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who drinks. And he drinks and he drinks. And he drinks once again. He'll drink to the health. Of the whores of Amsterdam. Who've given their bodies. To a thousand other men. Yeah, they've bargained their virtue. Their goodness all gone. For a few dirty coins. Well he just can't go on. Throws his nose to the sky. And he aims it up above. And he pisses like I cry. On the unfaithful love. In the port of Amsterdam. In the port of Amsterdam."
an occasional dream,"I recall how we lived. On the corner of a bed. And we'd speak of the Swedish room. Of hessian and wood. And we'd talk with our eyes. Of the sweetness in our lives. And tomorrows of rich surprise.... Some things we could do. In our madness. We burnt one hundred days. Time takes time to pass. And I still hold some ashes to me. An Occasional Dream. And we'd sleep, oh so close. But not really close our eyes. Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue.... Gently weeping nights. It was long, long ago. And I still can't touch your name. For the days of fate were strong for you.... Danced you far from me. In my madness. I see your face in mine. I keep a photograph. It burns my wall with time. Time. An Occasional Dream. Of mine. An Occasional Dream. Of mine. An Occasional Dream. Of mine"

baal's hymn,"Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal. Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale. Naked, young, immensely marvellous. Like Baal loved it, when he came to us. That same sky remained with him in joy and care. Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware. At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal. Turning pious as the sky grows pale. So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar. Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go. When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far. He will have his sky down there below. When the sinners congregate in shame together. Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress. Only sky, a sky that will go on forever. Formed a blanket for his nakedness. And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield. To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs. Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed. Baal survived it, he just used his eyes. And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round. He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room. ""Space enough"" said Baal, ""then I'll thicken the ground. Space enough within this woman's womb"". Any vice for Baal has got its useful side. It's the man who practices it, he can't abide. Vices have their point, once you see it as such. Stick to two for one will be too much. Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun. Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun. Lots of strength is needed and experience too. Swollen bellies can embarrass you. Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears. Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears. Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth. Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep. Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky. As they wait up there to see if Baal will die. Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop. Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup. When the dark womb drags him down to its prize. What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed. So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes. He'll just have enough sky when he's dead. Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal. Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale. Naked, young, immensely marvellous."

ballad of the adventurers,"Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten. A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair. Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten. Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there. Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades. You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid. Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies. It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed. Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans. Though his mother has given him up for lost. Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition. Always in search of that land where life seems best. Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises. Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face. At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises."

bars of the county jail,"Gather you all and listen here. I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear. I rode a horse through many a town. But the devil rode me down to the ground. I was to marry a very rich girl. I loved her as only I can. But the father was shot and his gold was stoled. And now I'm the devil's man, na na na. And now I sing a tail of woe. Through the bars of the county jail. I walked into the room one night. I found her mother and gun. Well the man was dead and I kneeled and cried. The sheriff ran in and said I'm holding you, son. Through the day I sing and play. For time is on my side. But when the moon and stars come out. I lay me down and cry. For the Saviour mar I lied. Now I will not have a ride. Beside the window the scaffold was made."

You won't kill me. You won't kill me. But I wonder why. Yes, and I wonder why sometimes. They'll show us how to break the rules. But never how to make the rules. Reduce us down to witless punks.

buddha of suburbia,"Living in lies by the railway line. Pushing the hair from my eyes. Elvis is English and climbs the hills. Can't tell the bullshit from the lies. Screaming along in South London. Vicious but ready to learn. Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer. Sometimes but always in vain. So I'll wait until we're sane. Wait until we're blessed and all the same. Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give. Englishmen going insane. Down on my knees in suburbia. Down on myself in every way. With great expectations I change all my clothes. Mustn't crumble at silver and gold. Screaming above Central London. Never born, so I'll never get old. So I'll wait until we're sane. Wait until we're blessed and all the same. Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give. Englishmen going insane. Down on my knees in suburbia. Down on myself in every way. Day after. Day after. Day. Day after. Zane, Zane, Zane.

bus stop,There's a cry that is heard in the city. From Vivian at Pentecost Lane. A shriekin' and dancing till 4 a.m.. Another night of muscles and pain. I love you despite your convictions. That God never laughs at my jokes. I'm a young man at odds with the Bible. But I don't pretend faith never works. When we're down on our knees. Prayin' at the bus stop. Now Jesus he came in a vision. And offered you redemption from sin. I'm not sayin' that I don't believe you. But are you sure that it really was him. I've been told that it couldn've been blue cheese. Or the meal that we ate down the road. I'm a young man at odds with the Bible. But I don't pretend faith never works. When we're down on our knees. Prayin' at the bus stop
buzz the fuzz,"Once there was a fellow and his name was Buzz. He was just a rookie cop, just a baby Buzz. He patroled the Sunset Strip in the land of the free and the home of the hip. He protected you and me from evil women like poor Alice D. Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread. And they called her sweet Alice the head. Alice it was plain to see, was full of pot and STD. She'd attract a great big crowd, because her inner piece was much too loud. Good Buzz did the thing that all the good Buzz must. Stuck his gun in Alice's back and said ""This is a Buzz"". Shone the flashlight in her eyes, she began to hypnotise. Buzz said ""What a wild sensation, guess this must be hallucination"". Love is so sensational, when you fall in love with eyes dilational. Now they're taking pills in shops, Buzz is not afraid of what. Buzz and Alice D have shown the way of where the Buzz might be some day. Buzz is still a cop of course, he's the pusher on the porch."

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people. Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up. Some make you sing and some make you scream. One makes you wish that you'd never been seen. But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier. mache. Making bullet-proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay. If you want it, boys, get it here, thing. So you scream out of line. ""I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Any time?"". Tres butch little number whines ""Hey dirty, I want you. When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"". If you want it, boys, get it here, thing. Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head. For I put all I have in another bed. On another floor, in the back of a car. In the cellar like a church with the door ajar. Well, I guess we've must be looking for a different kind. But we can't stop trying 'till we break up our minds. 'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights. Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright. I guess we could cruise down one more time. With you by my side, it should be fine.

I make it a thing, to glance in window panes and look pleased with myself. Yeah, and pretend I'm walking home. I took it so bad, I sat in the correction room. Took me a fag, and a kick in the moon.

I can ease your pain. Get you on your feet again. Relax. I'll need some information first. Just the basic facts. Can you show me where it hurts?. There is no pain, you are receding. A distant ship's smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move. but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I had a fever. My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've got that feeling once again. I can't explain,. You would not understand. This is not how I am. I have become comfortably numb. O.K.. Just a little pin prick. There'll be no more aaaaaaaah. But you may feel a little sick. Can you stand up?. I do believe it's working, good. That'll keep you going through the show. Come on it's time to go. There is no pain, you are receding. A distant ship's smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move. but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child. I caught a fleeting glimpse. Out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone. I cannot put my finger on it now. The child is grown. The dream is gone. I have become comfortably numb"
conversation piece,"I took this walk to ease my mind. To find out what's gnawing at me. Wouldn't think to look at me,. that I've spent a lot of time in education. It all seems so long ago. I'm a thinker, not a talker. I've no-one to talk to, anyway. I can't see the road. for the rain in my eyes. Ahhh .... I live above the grocers store,. owned by an Austrian. He often calls me down to eat. And he jokes about his broken English,. tries to be a friend to me. But for all my years of reading conversation,. I stand without a word to say. I can't see the bridge. for the rain in my eye. Ahhh.... And the world is full of life. Full of folk who don't know me. And they walk in twos or threes or mor. While the light that shines above the grocer's store. Investigates my face so rudely. And my essays lying scattered on the floor. Fulfill their needs just by being there. And my hands shake, my head hurts,. my voice sticks inside my throat. I'm invisible and dumb,. And no-one will recall me. And I can't see the water. through the tears in my ey-y-yes."

cracked actor,"I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs. The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had. I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made. Forget that I'm fifty cause you just got paid. Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real. Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel. Suck, baby, suck, give me your head. Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead. Oh stay. Please stay. Please stay. You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine. But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine.

criminal world,"You never told me of your other faces. You were the widow of a wild cat. And now I know about your special kisses. And I know you know where that's at. I guess I recognise your destination. I think I see beneath your make-up. What you want is sort of separation. This is no ordinary. This is no ordinary. (Ah, ah, ah). What a criminal world. The boys are like baby-faced girls. What a criminal girl. She'll show you where to shoot your gun. What a typical mother's son. The only thing that she enjoys. Is a criminal world. Where the girls are like baby-faced boys. You've got a very heavy reputation. But no-one knows about your low-life. I know a way to find a situation. And hold a candle to your high-life disguise. You caught me kneeling at your sister's door. That was no ordinary stick-up. I'm well aware just what you're looking for. I am no ordinary. I am no ordinary. (Ah, ah, ah). What a criminal world. The boys are like baby-faced girls. What a criminal girl. She'll show you where to shoot your gun. What a typical mother's son. The only thing that she enjoys. Is a criminal world.

cygnet committee,"I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes. I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess. Because of you I need to rest. Because it's you that sets the test. So much has gone and little is new. And as the sparrow sings. Dawn chorus for. Someone else to hear. The Thinker sits alone growing older. And so bitter. I gave Them life. I gave Them all. They drained my very soul...dry. I crushed my heart to ease Their pains. No thought for me remains there. Nothing can They spare. What of me?. Who praised Their efforts to be free?. Words of strength and care and sympathy. I opened doors that would have blocked Their way. I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay. I ravaged at my finance just for Those. Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility. Those who said a new world, new ways ever free. Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me. I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes. I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess. Because of you I need to rest, oh yes. Because it's you that sets the test. So much has gone and little is new. And as the sunrise stream. Flickers on me,. My friends talk. Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word. ""We had a friend, a talking man. Who spoke of many powers he had. Not of the best of men, but Ours. We used him. We let him use his powers. We let him fill Our needs. Now We are strong. And the road is coming to its end. Now the damned have no time to make amends. No purse of token fortune stands in Our way. The silent guns of love will blast the sky. We broke the ruptured structure built of age. Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage. Where money stood. We planted seeds of rebirth. And stabbed the backs of fathers. Sons of dirt. Infiltrated business cesspools. Hating through Our sleeves. Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat. Stoned the poor on slogans such as. Wish You Could Hear. Love Is All We Need. Kick Out The Jams. Kick Out Your Mother. Cut Up Your Friend. Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End. And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above. And We Can Force You to Be Free. And We Can Force You to Believe. And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain. For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain. For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain. It said. I believe in the Power of Good. I Believe in the State of Love. I Will Fight For the Right to be Right. I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right. And I open my eyes to look around. And I see a child laid slain on the ground. As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows. Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command. But not hearing anymore. Not hearing anymore. Just the shrieks from the old rich. And I Want to Believe. In the madness that calls now. And I want to Believe. That a light's shining through. Somehow. And I Want to Believe. And You Want to Believe. And We Want to Believe. And We Want to Live. Oh, We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. We Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. I Want to Live. Live. Live. Liiive"

david bowie's revolutionary song,"When people call us revolutionary. They're just tryin' to see. All that we choose. When all we want is everybody free. The universe would be one brotherhood. It isn't wrong to be prepared to fight. Together to unite if we believe. In giving everything our heart and soul. Until we reach the goal we should achieve. It shouldn't matter if we're brown or white. Yellow or black as night to anyone. We're all born equal with the self same rights. Sharing the same daylight under the sun. If loving freedom makes me quality. Of opportunity is where revolutionary. Constantly, fervently, firmly."

dead against it,"And when she drowns. Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh. ""Good god"" or ""My"" I cry and die and lie beside. She is the apple in my eye. She talked to god. I couldn't cope. Or'd hope eloped. A dope she roped. This salty lie. And when she's dreaming, I believe. And when she's reading, I retreat. Can't believe her. Telling me she's dead again. Telling me she's dead against it. And deep my wound. Within for every second chance it was. thy-tore. From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn. She loves to talk into the phone. No matter who. No matter when. No matter where. No better than the faulty line. And when she's dreaming, I believe. And when she's reading, I retreat. Can't believe her. Telling me she's dead again."

diamond dogs,"This ain't rock'n'roll. This is genocide!. As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent. You asked for the latest party. With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump. Dressed like a priest you was. Tod Browning's freak you was. Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee. I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see. The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees. Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal. (Will they come?). I'll keep a friend serene. (Will they come?). Oh baby, come unto me. (Will they come?). Well, she's come, been and gone.. Come out of the garden, baby. You'll catch your death in the fog. Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs. Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs. The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat. And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase. The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope. Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go. Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach. Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch. Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake. Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized. (Will they come?). I'll keep a friend serene. (Will they come?). Oh baby, come unto me. (Will they come?). Well, she's come, been and gone.. Come out of the garden, baby. You'll catch your death in the fog. Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs. Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs. Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs. Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs. In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch. Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch. Just another future song, lonely little kitsch. (There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow. (Will they come?). I'll keep a friend serene. (Will they come?). Oh baby, come unto me. (Will they come?). Well, she's come, been and gone.. Come out of the garden, baby. You'll catch your death in the fog.

If the girl that you dreamed of last night. Had the same dream, in the very same scene. With the very same boy, hold tight. It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend.

dodo,"Now we can talk in confidence. Did you guess that we've been done wrong. Lies jumped the queue to be first in line. Such a shameless design.

He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me. He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me. She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore. When a unit was a figure not a she. When lovers chose each other now the perk's are due. Another memo to screw. She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me. She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me. Can you wipe your nose my child without them stlotting in your file a photograph. Can you sleep alone at night wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim. He's come to turn you in. Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me. Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me. Another do, do."

And try to get it on like once before. When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored. Like the video films we saw. His name was always Buddy (got got du aaah aah aah).

It's hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation. (bah dom bah) Cursing at the Astronette. (dom du aaah) Who stands in steel by his cabinet. He's crashing out with Sylvian. The Bureau Supply for ageing men. With snorting head he gazes to the shore. Once had raised a sea that raged no more. Like the video films we saw. His name was always Buddy (got got du aaah aah aah).

eight line poem,The tactful cactus by your window. Surveys the prairie of your room. Mobile spins to its collision. Clara puts her head between her paws. They've opened shops down West side. Will all the cacti find a home. But the key to the city. Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky
even a fool learns to love,"There was a time, the laughing time. I took my heart to every party. They'd point my way. ""How are you today?"". ""Will you make us laugh? Chase our blues away?"". Their funny man won't let them down. No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown. That time, the laughing time. When even a fool learns to love. The clown turned around. And saw her smile, Oh how she loved me. She'd clap her hands and beg me stay. To make her laugh, to make her life gay. Who wants the love of all the world. When here was love in the eyes of just one girl. That day, that precious day. When even a fool learns to love. But Oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream. Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed. With thunderous applause looked down from above. On a clown and an angel so much in love. I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream. And even a fool learns to love. That day, that hateful day. The joke turned stale, the game was over. Those spiteful words ""Oh, go away. Who wants to play?"". ""It's getting late now."". My world, my funny world. Had lost its mask and shown a broken heart. A time, a sour time. When even a fool learns to love. But Oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream. Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed. With thunderous applause looked down from above. On a clown and an angel so much in love. I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream."

future legend,"And in the death. As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare. The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building. High on Poacher's Hill. And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City. No more big wheels. Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats. And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes. Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers. Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue. Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers. Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald. Any day now."

glass spider,"Up until one century ago there lived,. In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country. A glass-like spider.. Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,. In weeks creating a macabre. Shrine of remains. Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,. Like floors in a buuilding. At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent. Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.. One could almost call it an altar.. When the breeze blew thru this construction,. It produced sounds of wailing, crying.. Tiny wails, tiny cries.. The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically. For their mother.. But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies. Would survive someone on their own.. Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.. They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.. Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you. (Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone). But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell. (Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now). Take care, take care.. (Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone). Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.. But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Gone, Gone the water's all gone. Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone. Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid. Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake. Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.. If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might. Gone, gone, the water's all gone. Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah. Gone gone the water's all gone. Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone"
god knows i'm good,"I was walking through the counters of a national concern. And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder. And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean. As the merchandise exchanged and money roared. And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak. Into the paper bag at her side. And her face was white with fear in case her actions. were observed. So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind. Crying. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God may look the other way today. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God may look the other way today. Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag. Perspiration trickled down her forehead. And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder. She was led away bewildered and amazed. Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter. As her escort asked her softly for her name. And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady. Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor. Crying. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. Surely God won't look the other way. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. God knows I'm good. Surely God won't look the other way."
god only knows,I may not always love you. But as long as there are stars above you. You'll never need to doubt it. I'll make you so sure about it. God only knows what I'd be without you. If you should ever leave me. My life would still go on believe me. The world could show nothing to me. So what good would living do me. God only knows what I'd be without you

growin' up,"Well I stood stone like at midnight. Suspended in my masquerade. I combed my hair till it was just right. And commanded the night brigade. I was open to pain and crossed by the rain. And I walked on a crooked crutch. I strolled all alone through a fallout zone. Came out with my soul untouched. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd. But when they said 'Sit down' I stood up. Ooh-ohh ooh hoo growin' up. The flag of piracy flew from my mast. My sails were set wing to wing. I had a jukebox graduate for first mate. She couldn't sail but she sure could sing. I pushed the B-52 and bombed em with the blues. With my gear set stubborn on standing. I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school. Never once gave thought to landing, no. I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd. But when they said Come down I threw up. Ooh-ooh growin' up. I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere. And you know it's really hard to hold your breath. And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared. I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress. Well my feet finally took root in the earth. But I got me a nice little place in the stars. And I swear I found the key to the universe. In the engine of an old parked car. I hid in the mother breast of the crowd. But when they said move down I moved up. Ooh ooh ooh, don't you know that I'm growin' up."

how does the grass grow?,There's a graveyard by the station. Where the girls wear nylon skirts and. Sandals from Hungary. The boys ride their Riga 1's. Upon the little hill. Such sadness and grief. The trees die standing. That's where we made our trysts. And struggled with our guns. Would you still love me. If the clocks could go backwards. The girls would fill with blood and. The grass would be green again. Remember the dead. They were so great. Some of them. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. Where do the boys lie. Mud mud mud. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood. But I lived a blind life. A white face in prison. But you made a life out of nothing. Now I ride my black horse. I miss you. More than you'll ever ever know. Waiting with my red eyes. And my stone heart. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. Where do the boys lie. Mud mud mud. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood. I gaze in defeat. At the stars in the night. The light in my life burnt away. There will be no tomorrow. Then you sigh in your sleep. And meaning returns with the day. Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Ya ya ya ya ya ya. Where do the boys lie. Mud mud mud. How does the grass grow. Blood blood blood
how lucky you are,"When you speak you speak to me. When you sleep you sleep by me. When you wake you wake with me. When you walk you follow two steps behind in life. Shadows stalking, ever grasping sinking for a need. It wasn't love it was the fix of never wanting me. Now I'm gone, you're tossing and you turning in your sleep. That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game. Cry, Miss Peculiar. You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone. I was the monkey on your back. Take a look at how lucky you are.

You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone. I was the monkey on your back. Take a look at how lucky you are. Some days are heaven, I will not deny. Probing the daylight cascading the skyline. Tripping and diving and losing it all. Back came the night time living for more. Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar. You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone. I was the devil monkey on your back. Take a look at how lucky you are. When you speak you speak to me. When you sleep you sleep by me. When you wake you wake with me. When you walk you follow two steps behind."

And that morning bed been on that trip so many times. Good God was it really yestrday?. I tried so many many many many many, many ways. I've lied and taken often to the day.

Gonna be, yeah. Let's play, not play this record. Waitin' for the telephone to ring. Wiped-out and bitter, with a bag clutched in her hand. All the cars sound like they're. pulling in the drive. Umm, no, no, no, no, no, uhh. I see her now. A little tear running down her check. Laugh! Let down. People looking for me. I want to race down her street and knock hard, hard, hard on the door 'til. Until she breaks down into my arms like a tracy tie, and I feel the pain. I'll be so strong again and again. Come back my brain, yeah. I'm holy again I'll take ya, oh, babe, baby, baby. We're gonna have, oh, baby, baby, My kind of love can only bring you joy. I'm gonna, oh, baby Yeah, got far. Give you, baby, baby 'Cause it's gonna be me."
it's hard to be a saint in the city,"I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra. I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a super-nova. I could walk like Brando right into the sun, an' dance just like a Casanova. With my black-jack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet. Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat. When I strut down the street I can hear its' heartbeat. The sisters fell back and said ""Don't that man look pretty"". The cripple on the corner cried out ""Penny, nickels for your pity"". Them gasoline boys down-town, they sure talk gritty. It's so hard to be a saint in the city. I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash. I was the Prince of the Paupers, crowned down-town at the Beggars' Bash. I was a pimps main prophet, I kept everything cool. Just a back-street gambler with the luck to lo..ose. And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama. Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street, an'. Showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat. And I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat, and It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a poor bo..oy out on the street. And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead. As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead. They ride the line of balancin', hold on by just a thread. Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat. When you get up to get out at your next stop, but they push you right down in your seat. And your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet. Then you're out of that hole!, back on the street. And them south-side sisters, they sure look pretty. And the cripple on the corner cries out ""Nickels for your pity"". And them down-town boys, they sure talk gritty."
it's no game (part 1),"1. 2. 1-2-2. Shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru. Mo tengoku no giyu no kaidan wa nai. Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution. No more free steps to heaven. It's no game. Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare. Nani ga okkote irunoka wakara nai. Doko ni kyokun wa arunoka. Hitobito wa yubi o orareteiru. Konna dokusaisha ni iyashime rareru nowa kanashii. I am bored from the event. I really don't understand the situation. And it's no game. Documentaries on refugees. Couples 'gainst the target. You throw a rock against the road. And it breaks into pieces. Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier. Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers. Nammin no kiroku eiga. Hyoteki o se ni shita koibito tachi. Michi ni ishi o nage reba. Kona gona ni kudake. Kino ni huta o sureba. Kyohu wa masu. Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba. Shinbun wa kaki tateru. There's always tomorrow when people have their fingers broken. To be insulted by these fascists - it's so degrading. And it's no game. Shutup! Shutu.... Up The Hill Backwards. The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom. And the possibilities it seems to offer. It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it. It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it. A series of shocks - sneakers fall aart. Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling. It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it. It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it. Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards. It'll be alright ooo-ooo. While we sleep they go to work. We're legally crippled it's the death of love. It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it. It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it. More idols thean realities. I'm OK, you're so-so. Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards. It'll be alright ooo-ooo. Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps). She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat. When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home. She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do. She opened strange doors that we'd never close again. She began to wail jealousies scream. Waiting at the light know what I mean. Chorus: (twice). Scary monsters, super creeps. Keep me running, running scared. She asked me to stay and I stole her room. She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind. Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise. Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies. She wails. Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream. Waiting at the light know what I mean. (Chorus) (twice). (Chorus) (twice). Oh oh woh-oh. Oh, oh-oh-oh oh. Oh oh oh, oh oh. Ashes To Ashes. Do you remember a guy that's been. In such an early song. I've heard a rumour from Ground Control. Oh no, don't say it's true. They got a message from the Action Man. ""I'm happy, hope you're happy too. I've loved all I've needed to love. Sordid details following"". The shrieking of nothing is killing. Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I. Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair. But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing. Chorus:. Ashes to ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out in heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. Time and again I tell myself. I'll stay clean tonight. But the little green wheels are following me. Oh no, not again. I'm stuck with a valuable friend. ""I'm happy, hope you're happy too"". One flash of light but no smoking pistol. I never done good things. I never done bad things. I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh. Want an axe to break the ice. Wanna come down right now. (Chorus). Repeat. My mother said to get things done. You'd better not mess with Major Tom. Fashion. There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name. That people from bad homes do again and again. It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear. They do it over there but we don't do it here. Fashion! Turn to the left. Fashion! Turn to the right. Oooh, fashion!. We are the goon squad and we're coming to town. Beep-beep. Beep-beep. Listen to me - don't listen to me. Talk to me - don't talk to me. Dance with me - don't dance with me, no. Beep-beep. There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear. Oh bop. That people from good homes are talking this year. Oh bop, fashion. It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before. Oh bop. You shout it while you're dancing on the ole dance floor. Oh bop, fashion. Fashion! Turn to the left. Fashion! Right. Fashion!. We are the goon squad and we're coming to town. Beep-beep. Beep-beep. Listen to me - don't listen to me. Talk to me - don't talk to me. Dance with me - don't dance with me, no. Beep-beep. Beep-beep. Repeat. Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do. Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion. Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do. Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion. La-la la la la la la-la. Teenage Wildlife. Well, how come you only want tomorrow. With its promise of something hard to do. A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold. Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength in your stride. And hope in those squeaky clean eyes. You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go. Blinded with desire - guess the season is on. So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth. But it's all, but it's all used up. Break open your million dollar weapon. And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck. A broken nosed mogul are you. One of the new wave boys. Same old thing in brand new drag. Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh. As ugly as a teenage millionaire. Pretending it's a whizz kid world. You'll take me aside, and say. ""Well, David, what shall I do?. They wait for me in the hallway"". I'll say ""Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"". But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner. I feel like a group of one, no-no. They can't do this to me. I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife. Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes. The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own. You're alone for maybe the last time. And you breathe for a long time. Then you howl like a wolf in a trap. And you daren't look behind. You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree. And look up one time at that vast blue sky. Scream out aloud as they shoot you down. No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. And no one will have seen and no one will confess. The fingerprints will prove that you coudn't pass the test. There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low. I miss you he really had to go. Well each to his own, he was. Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh. Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh. Another piece of teenage wild.... Wild. Wild. Wild. Scream Like A Baby. Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise. And I wouldn't go to war. And I mixed with other colours. But the nurse doesn't care. And I hide under blankets. Or did I run away. I really can't remember. Last time I saw the light of day. But I remember Sam 'cause he was like me. Chorus:. Scream like a baby. Sam was a gun. And I never knew his last name. And we never had no fun. Well they came down hard on the faggots. And they came down hard on the street. They came down harder on Sam. And they all knew he was beat. He was thrown into the wagon. Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us. And took away our clothes and things. And pumped us full of strange drugs. And oh I saw Sam falling. Spitting in their eyes. But now I lay me down to sleep. And now I close my eyes. Now I'm learning to be a part of soc-society. (Chorus). No athletic program, no discipline, no book. He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge. But he jumped into the furnace. Singing old songs we loved. (Chorus) (twice). Kingdom Come. Well I walked in the pouring rain. And I heard a voice that cries ""It's all in vain"". The voice of doom was shining in my room. I just need one day somewhere far away. Lord I just need one day. Well I'll be breaking these rocks. And cutting this hay. Yes I'll be breaking these rocks. What's my price to pay. Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear. And I know too well what's keeping me here. I'm just the slave of a burning ray. Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight. Please, please give me the night. Chorus. Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high. Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die. I won't be breaking no rocks. I said ""I won't be breaking no rocks"". (I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh. (I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh. (I won't be breaking no rocks). When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf). Because You're Young. Psychodelicate girl - come out to play. Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away. They're so war-torn and resigned she can't talk any more. What are they trying to prove?. What would they like to find?. It's love back to front and no sides - like I say. These pieces are broken - like I say. These pieces are broken. Hope I'm wrong but I know. Chorus:. Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night. Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it makes me sad. So I'll dance my life away. A million dreams, a million scars. He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime. She took back everything she said. Left him nearly out of his mind. They're people I know - people I love. They seem so unhappy - dead or alive. It's love back to front and no sides - like I say. These pieces are broken - like I say. These pieces are broken. Hope I'm wrong but I know. (Chorus). A million dreams. A million scars. A million (repeat ad inf.). It's No Game (Part 2). Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution. No more free steps to heaven. Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth. Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan. And it's no game. I am barred from the event. I really don't understand the situation. So where's the moral. People have their fingers broken. To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading. And it's no game. Documentaries on refugees, couples 'gainst the target. Throw a rock against the road, and it breaks into pieces. Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier. Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers. And it's no game. Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls. They're making carpets on treadmills, or garbage sorting. And it's no game"

karma man,"Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls. At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes. Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round. Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes. A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he's clogged and clothed in saffron robes. His beads are all he owns. Slow down, slow down. Someone must have said that slow him down. Slow down, slow down. It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man. Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos. Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before. Karma Man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life. I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why. I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but. All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin. Slow down, slow down. Someone must have said that slowed him down. Slow down, slow down. It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man. Slow down, slow down. Someone must have said that slowed him down. Slow down, slow down."
killing a little time,"I staggered through this criminal reign. I'm not in love, no phony pain. Creeping through this tidal wave. No warm embrace, just a lover's grain. This symphony. This rage in me. I've got a handful of songs to sing. To sting your soul. To fuck you over. This furious reign. I'm falling, man. I'm choking, man. I'm fading, man. And a broken line. I'm falling, man. I'm choking, man. I'm fading, man. Just killing a little time. I love the sound of an empty room. The screams of light, the end of love. Two beating hearts, one labored start. One open wound, wasted and drawn. No sympathy. This furious reign. I lay in bed. The monster fed, the body bled. I turned and said. I get some of you all the time. All of you some other time. This rage in me. Get away from me. I'm falling, man. I'm choking, man. I'm fading, man. And a broken line. I'm falling, man. I'm choking, man. I'm fading, man. Just killing a little time.

lady stardust,"People stared at the makeup on his face. Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace. The boy in the bright blue jeans. Jumped up on the stage. And lady stardust sang his songs. Of darkness and disgrace. CHORUS. And he was alright, the band was altogether. Yes he was alright, the song went on forever. And he was awful nice. Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise). And he sang all night long. Femme fatales emerged from shadows. To watch this creature fair. Boys stood upon their chairs. To make their point of view. I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey. Lady stardust sang his songs. Of darkness and dismay. CHORUS. Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name. CHORUS."

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore. Let me sleep beside you. Lock away your childhood and throw away the key. For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals. We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger. Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free. I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together. Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore. Let me sleep beside you. Your darkened eyes throw mystery. But your lips are void of history. You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you. I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear. Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore. Let me sleep beside you."

Love is the key we must turn. Truth is the flame we must learn. Freedom the lesson we must learn. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?. Love is the key we must turn. Truth is the flame we must burn. Freedom the lesson we must learn. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?. You say you find it hard. To lead the life that we once knew. But there's no other way. So now it's really up to you. Love is the key we must turn. Truth is the flame we must learn. Freedom the lesson we must learn. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?. Love is the key we must turn. Truth is the flame we must burn. Freedom the lesson we must learn. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?.
love you till tuesday,"Just look through your window, look who sits outside. Little me is waiting, standing through the night. When you walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout. Ohh, beautiful baby. My burning desire started on Sunday. Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch. Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance. If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool. Ohh, beautiful baby. I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday. My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Da da da dum. Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea. Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me. I shall always watch you until my love runs dry. Ohh, beautiful baby. My heart's a flame, I'll love you till Tuesday. My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday. Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday. Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday. Da da da dum.

lover to the dawn,"And as the sparrow sings. Dawn chorus for. Someone else to hear. The thinker sits alone growing older. And so bitter. She gave them life,. She gave them all. They drained her very soul dry...dry. Hey hey hey bitter girl. We're out to sitting here digging you. We flew done here just to figure you. It's easy. Don't be so bitter. Oh oh oh crazy girl. You gave too much and you got nothing. Too many problems and not one thing. In return. Left high and dry. Door. And as the sun rise stream. Flickers on. She finds lavender."
loving the alien,"Watching them come and go. The templars and the saracens. They're traveling the holy land. Opening telegrams. Torture comes and torture goes. Knights who'd give you anything. They bear the cross of coeuf de leon. Salvation for the mirror blind. But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky. Pray and the heathen lie will disappear. Prayers they hide the saddest view. (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien). And your prayers they break the sky in two. (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien). You pray til the break of dawn. (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien). And you'll believe you're loving the alien. (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien). Thinking of a different time. Palestine a modern problem. Bounty and your wealth in land. Terror in a best laid plan. Watching them come and go. Tomorrows and the yesterdays. Christians and the unbelievers. Hanging by the cross and nail"
lucy can't dance,"Lucy I know what you're going to going to do. Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too. Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways.

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do. So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong. Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song. Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do. Of the show of the fine reality. Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you. Live and to die in the blink of an eye. Still I can't make you dance. Lucy can't dance. Dance to the noise. Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do. Lucy can't dance. Dance to the noise. Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can. Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can. Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can.

maid of bond street,"This girl is made of lipstick. Powder and paint. Sees the pictures of herself. Every magazine on every shelf. This girl is maid of Bond Street. Hailing cabs, lunches with executives. Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs. This girl is a lonely girl. Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus. Buys the Daily News. But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her. This girl is made of loneliness. A broken heart. For the boy that she once knew. Doesn't want to know her any more. And this girl is a lonely girl. Every thing she wants is hers. But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with. All the time, to love, all the time. This boy is made of envy. Jealousy. He doesn't have a limousine. Really wants to be a star himself. This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films. Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor. And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars. Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars. Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares. Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs."

memory of a free festival,"Maybe I should announce it, should I. Memory of a free festival. The Children of the summer's end. Gathered in the dampened grass. We played Our songs and felt the London sky. Resting on our hands. It was God's land. It was ragged and naive. It was Heaven. Touch, We touched the very soul. Of holding each and every life. We claimed the very source of joy ran through. It didn't, but it seemed that way. I kissed a lot of people that day. Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon. To paint that love upon a white balloon. And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops. That man has pushed beyond his brain. Satori must be something just the same. We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size. We talked with tall Venusians passing through. And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head. And away they soared. Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud. Someone passed some bliss among the crowd. And We walked back to the road, unchained. The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, ha ha ha. (repeat 25 times). The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, yeah yeah. The Sun Machine is coming down, woh ho ho. Sun Machine is coming down, oh oh oh ah. Sun Machine is coming down, oh"

And I'm never ever gonna get old. And I'm never ever gonna get. I'm never ever gonna get. I'm never ever gonna get old. And I'm never ever gonna get. And I'm never ever gonna get."
never let me down,When I believed in nothing I called her name. Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name. And though my days are slipping by. And nights so cruel I thought I'd die. She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry. She was shakin' like this honey doing that. When I needed soul revival I called your name. When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain. Your soothing hand that turned me round. A love so real swept over me. You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry. You were shakin' like this honey doing that. Never let me down She never let me down. Never let me down She never let me down. When all your faith is failing Call my name. When you've nothing coming Call my name. I'll be strong for all it takes. I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks. I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile. Shaking like this honey doing that. Never let you down I'll never let you down. I'll never let you down I'll never let you down

She sees the rich trash having all the fun. Makes her wonder where they get the energy from. There's nothing you can do to her. This city's all clean and waiting. I don't mean to wait too long. But this joint can't get much higher. Chorus:. New York's in love-. With her big green eyes. And her long blonde hair. New York's in flames. New York's in love. With the way she talks. And the way she walks. New York's in love. Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo. My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat. No-one knows they've had their day. We can dance and we can see the singles swing. Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys.. You're turned to stone by the family. It's now the dead speak to the living. Nothing left here but a raging blaze. I don't mean to wait too long. (chorus)"

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home. Found him slumped across the table. A gun and me alone. I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two. Panic in Detroit.

please mr. gravedigger,"There's a little churchyard just along the way. It used to be Lambeth's finest array. Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz. Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot. And in this little yard, there's a little old man. With a little shovel in his little bitty hand. He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves. He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home. Ah-choo ! excuse me. Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed. As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed. Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care. If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair. And you put it in your pocket. God, it's pouring down. Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy. She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys. And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell. So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket. Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day , st ....ah choo !. Standing in the same spot by a certain grave.

port of amsterdam,"Written by Jacques Brel - Performed by David Bowie. . In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who sings. Of the dreams that he brings. From the wide open sea. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who sleeps. While the river bank weeps. To the old willow tree. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who dies. Full of beer, full of cries. In a drunken town fight. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who's born. On a hot muggy morn. By the dawn's early light. In the port of Amsterdam. Where the sailors all meet. There's a sailor who eats. Only fish heads and tails. And he'll show you his teeth. That have rotted too soon. That can haul up the sails. That can swallow the moon. And he yells to the cook. With his arms open wide. ""Hey, bring me more fish. Throw it down by my side"". And he wants so to belch. But he's too full to try. So he stands up and laughs. And he zips up his fly. . In the port of Amsterdam. You can see sailors dance. Paunches bursting their pants. Grinding women to porch. They've forgotten the tune. That their whiskey voice croaked. Splitting the night. With the roar of their jokes. And they turn and they dance. And they laugh and they lust. Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts. And then out of the night. With their pride in their pants. And the sluts that they tow. Underneath the street lamps. In the port of Amsterdam. There's a sailor who drinks. And he drinks and he drinks. And he drinks once again. He'll drink to the health. Of the whores of Amsterdam. Who've given their bodies. To a thousand other men. Yeah, they've bargained their virtue. Their goodness all gone. For a few dirty coins. Well he just can't go on. Throws his nose to the sky. And he aims it up above. And he pisses like I cry. On the unfaithful love. In the port of Amsterdam. In the port of Amsterdam."

remembering marie a.,"It was a day in that blue month September. Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade. I held her there. My love, so pale and silent. As if she were a dream that must not fade. Above us in the shining summer heaven. There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon. It was quite white and very high above us. Then I looked up. And found that it had gone. And since that day, so many moons in silence. Have swum across the sky and gone below. The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood. And if you ask, how does that love seem now. I must admit, I really can't remember. And yet I know what you are trying to say. But what her face was like, I know no longer. I only know I kissed it on that day. As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it. But for the cloud that floated in the sky. I know that still and shall forever know it. It was quite white and moved in very high. It may be that the plum trees still are blooming. That woman's seventh child may now be there. And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes. When I looked up."

Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us. And took away our clothes and things. And pumped us full of strange drugs. And oh I saw Sam falling. Spitting in their eyes. But now I lay me down to sleep. And now I close my eyes. Now I'm learning to be a part of soc-society. (Chorus). No athletic program, no discipline, no book. He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge. But he jumped into the furnace. Singing old songs we loved. (Chorus) (twice). Kingdom Come. Well I walked in the pouring rain. And I heard a voice that cries ""It's all in vain"". The voice of doom was shining in my room. I just need one day somewhere far away. Lord I just need one day. Well I'll be breaking these rocks. And cutting this hay. Yes I'll be breaking these rocks. What's my price to pay. Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear. And I know too well what's keeping me here. I'm just the slave of a burning ray. Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight. Please, please give me the night. Chorus. Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high. Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die. I won't be breaking no rocks. I said ""I won't be breaking no rocks"". (I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh. (I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh. (I won't be breaking no rocks). When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf)"

From the brow of a superbrain. She'll scratch this world to pieces. As she comes on like a friend. But a couple of songs. From your old scrapbook. Could send her home again. You gave your heart to every bedsit room. At least a picture on the wall. And you sat behind a million pair of eyes. And told them how they saw. Then we lost your train of thought. The paintings are all your own. While troubles are rising. We'd rather be scared. Together than alone. Ah, Here she comes. Here she comes. Here she comes again. The same old painted lady. From the brow of a superbrain. She'll scratch this world to pieces. As she comes on like a friend. But a couple of songs. From your old scrapbook. Could send her home again. Aoo. Now hear this Robert Zimmerman. Though I don't suppose we'll meet. Ask your good friend Dylan. If he'd gaze a while down the old street. Tell him we've lost his poems. So they're writing on the walls. Give us back our unity. Give us back our family. You're every nation's refugee. Don't leave us with their sanity. Ah, Here she comes. Here she comes. Here she comes again. The same old painted lady. From the brow of a superbrain. She'll scratch this world to pieces. As she comes on like a friend. But a couple of songs. From your old scrapbook. Could send her home again. Come on. A couple of songs. From your old scrapbook. Could send her home again. Oh, here she comes, (oh) here she comes."

soul love,Stone love - she kneels before the grave. A brave son - who gave his life to see the slogan. That hovers between the headstone and her eyes. For they penetrate her grieving. New love - a boy and girl they talking. New words - that only they can share in. New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts. To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning. Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross a baby. Love descends on those defenseless. Idiot love will spark the fusion. Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove. All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving. Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and. Told of love - and how my God on high is. All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves. By the blindness that surrounds him. Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross a baby. Love descends on those defenseless. Idiot love will spark the fusion. Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove. All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving. Lai lai la-la la-la la-la la lai lai. La-lai la-lai la-lai lai lai lai

Where I will live. Blue, blue. Pale blinds drawn all day. Nothing to do, nothing to say. Blue, blue. I will sit right down, waiting for the gift of sound and vision. And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision. Drifting into my solitude, over my head. Don't you wonder sometimes"

If you want it, boys, get it here, thing. Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head. For I put all I have in another bed. On another floor, in the back of a car. In the cellar like a church with the door ajar. Well, I guess we've must be looking for a different kind. But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds. 'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights. Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright. I guess we could cruise down one more time. With you by my side, it should be fine.

Scream out aloud as they shoot you down. No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife. And no one will have seen and no one will confess. The fingerprints will prove that you coudn't pass the test. There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low. I miss you he really had to go. Well each to his own, he was.

the bewlay brothers,"And so the story goes they wore the clothes. They said the things to make it seem improbable. The whale of a lie like they hope it was. And the Goodmen Tomorrow. Had their feet in the wallow. And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn. And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust. And the world was asleep to our latent fuss. Sighing, the swirl through the streets. Like the crust of the sun. The Bewlay Brothers. In our Wings that Bark. Flashing teeth of Brass. Standing tall in the dark. Oh, And we were Gone. Hanging out with your Dwarf Men. We were so turned on. By your lack of conclusions. I was Stone and he was Wax. So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable. And we frightened the small children away. And our talk was old and dust would flow. Thru our veins and Lo! it was midnight. Back at the kitchen door. Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor. And the solid book we wrote. Cannot be found today. And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys. The Bewlay Brothers. With our backs on the arch. In the Devil-may-be-here. But He can't sing about that. Oh, And we were Gone. Real Cool Traders. We were so Turned On. You thought we were Fakers. Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned. The Factor Max that proved the fact. Is melted down. And woven on the edging of my pillow. Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks. He could be dead, He could be not. He could be You. He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature. Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky. The Bewlay Brothers. In the feeble and the Bad. Bewlay Brothers. In the Blessed and Cold. In the Crutch-hungry Dark. Was where we flayed our Mark. Oh, and we were Gone. Kings of Oblivion. We were so Turned On. In the Mind-Warp Pavilion. Lay me place and bake me Pie. I'm starving for me Gravy. Leave my shoes, and door unlocked. I might just slip away, hey. Just for the Day, Hey!. Hey, Please come Away, Hey!. Just for the Day, Hey!. Please come Away, Hey!. Please come Away, Hey!. Just for the Day. Please come Away. Please come Away. Please come Away.

the drowned girl,"Once she had drowned and started her slow descent. Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden. Oh, the open sky chant most magnificent. As if it was acting as her body's guardian. Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight. By clasping her in their slimy grip. Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played. Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip. And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke. And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring. But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke. To see that she got one further morning. Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair. It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts. First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair."

the laughing gnome,"I was walking down the High Street. When I heard footsteps behind me. And there was a little old man (Hello). In scarlet and grey, shuffling away (laughter). Well he trotted back to my house. And he sat beside the telly (Oaah..). With his tiny hands on his tummy. Chuckling away, laughing all day (laughter). Oh, I ought to report you to the Gnome office.

(Haven't you got a light boy?). ""Here, where do you come from?"". (Gnome-man's land, hahihihi). ""Oh, really?"". In the morning when I woke up. He was sitting on the edge of my bed. With his brother whose name was Fred. He'd bought him along to sing me a song. Right, let's hear it. Here, what's that clicking noise?. (That's Fred, he's a ""metrognome"", haha).

Now you've met the London boys. Things seem good again, someone cares about you. Oh, the first time that you tried a pill. You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill.

the memory of a free festival,"Maybe I should announce it, should I. Memory of a free festival. The Children of the summer's end. Gathered in the dampened grass. We played Our songs and felt the London sky. Resting on our hands. It was God's land. It was ragged and naive. It was Heaven. Touch, We touched the very soul. Of holding each and every life. We claimed the very source of joy ran through. It didn't, but it seemed that way. I kissed a lot of people that day. Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon. To paint that love upon a white balloon. And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops. That man has pushed beyond his brain. Satoria must be something just the same. We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size. We talked with tall Venusians passing through. And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head. And away they soared. Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud. Someone passed some bliss among the crowd. And We walked back to the road, unchained. The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, ha ha ha. (repeat 25 times). The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party, yeah yeah. The Sun Machine is coming down, woh ho ho. Sun Machine is coming down, oh oh oh ah."

the motel,"For we're living in a safety zone. Don't be holding back from me. We're living from hour to hour down here. And we'll take it when we can. It's a kind of living which recognizes. The death of the odourless man. When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow. It's not Eden but it's no sham. There is no hell. There is no shame. There is no hell. Like an old hell. There is no hell. And it's lights up, boys. Lights up boys. Explosion falls upon deaf ears. While we're swimming in a sea of sham. Living in the shadow of vanity. A complex fashion for a simple man. And there is no hell. And there is no shame. And there is no hell. Like an old hell. There is no hell. And the silence flies on its brief flight. A razor sharp crap shoot affair. And we light up our lives. And there's no more of me exploding you. Re-exposing you. Like everybody do. Re-exploding you. I don't know what to use. Make somebody move. Me exploding. Me exploding you."
the next day,"Look into my eyes, he tells her. I'm gonna say goodbye, he says yea. Do not cry she begs of him goodbye yea. All that day she thinks of his love yea. They whip him through the streets and alleys there. The gormless and the baying crowd right there. They can't get enough. Of that doomsday song. They can't get enough of it all. Listen. Listen to the whores he tells her. He fashions paper sculptures of them. Then drags them to the river's bank in the cart. Their soggy paper bodies. Wash ashore in the dark. And the priest stiff in hate. Now demanding fun begin. Of his women dressed as men. For the pleasure of that priest. Here I am. Not quite dying. My body left to rot in a hollow tree. Its branches throwing shadows. On the gallows for me. And the next day. And the next. And another day. Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases. They chase him through the alleys. Chase him down the steps. They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death. And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest. First they give you everything that you want. Then they take back everything that you have. They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees. They can work with Satan. While they dress like the saints. They know God exists for the Devil told them so. They scream my name aloud down into the well below. Here I am. Not quite dying. My body left to rot in a hollow tree. Its branches throwing shadows. On the gallows for me. And the next day. And the next. And another day"

They watch us from behind their shades. Brigitte, Jack and Kate and Brad. From behind their tinted window stretch. Gleaming like blackened sunshine. Stars are never sleeping. Dead ones and the living. Waiting for the first move. Satyrs and their child wives. Waiting for the last move. Soaking up our primitive world. Stars are never sleeping. Dead ones and the living. Their jealousy's spilling down. The stars must stick together. We will never be rid of these stars. But I hope they live forever. And they know just what we do. That we toss and turn at night.

the supermen,"When all the world was very young. And mountain magic heavy hung. The supermen would walk in file. Guardians of a loveless isle. And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives. Could heave nor sigh. In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life. Strange games they would play then. No death for the perfect men. Life rolls into one for them. So softly a supergod cries. Where all were minds in uni-thought. Power weird by mystics taught. No pain, no joy, no power too great. Colossal strength to grasp a fate. Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers. Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold. A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die. To turn to mold.. Far out in the red-sky. Far out from the sad eyes. Strange, mad celebration. So softly a supergod cries. Far out in the red-sky. Far out from the sad eyes. Strange, mad celebration. So softly a supergod dies."

the width of a circle,"In the corner of the morning in the past. I would sit and blame the master first and last. All the roads were straight and narrow. And the prayers were small and yellow. And the rumour spread that I was aging fast. Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping. By a tree. And I looked and frowned and the monster was me. Well, I said hello and I said hello. And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know"". So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be. And he laughed insane and quipped ""KAHLIL GIBRAN"". And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through. For I realized that God's a young man too. Ho. Oh I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye"". And I smashed my soul and traded my mind. Got laid by a young bordello. Who was vaguely half asleep. For which my reputation swept back home in drag. And the moral of this magic spell. Negotiates my hide. When God did take my logic for a ride. (Riding along). Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooooh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh. He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips. And showed me the leather belt round his hips. My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame. He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again"". (Turn around, go back!). He struck the ground a cavern appeared. And I smelt the burning pit of fear. We crashed a thousand yards below. I said ""Do it again, do it again"". (Turn around, go back!). His nebulous body swayed above. His tongue swollen with devil's love. The snake and I, a venom high. I said ""Do it again, do it again"". (Turn around, go back!). Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply. And I was seething, breathing deeply. Spitting sentry, horned and tailed. Waiting for you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
the wild eyed boy from freecloud,"Solemn faced. The village settles down. Undetected by the stars. And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep. And the last thing on his mind. Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned. Neath the covered wooden shaft. Folds the rope. Into its bag. Blows his pipe of smolders. Blankets smoke into the room. And the day will end for some. As the night begins for one. Staring through the message in his eyes. Lies a solitary son. From the mountain called Freecloud. Where the eagle dare not fly. And the patience in his sigh. Gives no indication. For the townsmen to decide. So the village Dreadful yawns. Pronouncing gross diversion. As the label for the dog. Oh It's the madness in his eyes. As he breaks the night to cry. It's really Me. Really You. And really Me. It's so hard for us to really be. Really You. And really Me. You'll lose me though I'm always really free. And the mountain moved its eyes. To the world of realize. Where the snow had saved a place. For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud. And the village dreadful cried. As the rope began to rise. For the smile stayed on the face. Of the wild eyed boy from freecloud. And the women once proud. Clutched the heart of the crowd. As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand. And the Magic in the stare. Of the Wild Eyed Boy, said. Stop, Freecloud. They won't think to cut me down"". But the cottages fell. Like a playing card hell. And the tears on the face. Of the Wise Boy. Came trembling down. To the rumbling ground. And the missionary mystic of peace/love. Stumbled to cry among the clouds. Kicking back the pebbles."

threepenny pierrot,"Threepenny Pierrot - we love you. Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too. Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes. Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot. Happy little feet that dance all day. Lonely little heart with lots to say. Stepping footprints on your mind. Offering thoughts of Columbine. Bang the drum and blow the bugle call. Pierrot takes the stage to play for all. For here's a life his fortune rules. Forsaken by his Columbine. Threepenny Pierrot - we love you. Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too. Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes. Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot. To tap his feet to greet dear Harlequin. The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win. A patchwork frame of tears and wine. The nectar for cruel Columbine. The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn. Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn. Relive each trial of rise and fall. The love which lacks between us all. Threepenny Pierrot - we love you. Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too. Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes. Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot. Threepenny Pierrot - we love you. Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too.

thru' these architects eyes,Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson. Is delay just wasting my time. Looking across at Richard Rogers. Scheming dreams to blow both their minds. It's difficult you see. To give up baby. To leave a Job. When you know the moneys from day to day. All the majesty of a city landscape. All the soaring days of our lives. All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye. All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes. Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel. This stone boy watching the crawling land. Rings of flesh and the towers of iron. The steaming caves and rocks and the sand. Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson. Is delay just wasting my time. It's difficult you see. To give up baby. These summer scumholes. This goddamned starving life. All the majesty of a city landscape. All the soaring days of our lives. All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye. All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes. It's difficult you see. It's difficult you see. All the majesty of a city landscape. All the soaring days in our lives. All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye.
thursday's child,"All of my life I've tried so hard. Doing my best with what I had. Nothing much happened all the same. Something about me stood apart. A whisper of hope that seemed to fail. Maybe I'm born right out of my time. Breaking my life in two. (Throw me tomorrow..oh,oh). Now that I've really got a chance. (Throw me tomorrow..oh,oh). Everything's falling into place. (Throw me tomorrow..oh,oh). Seeing my past to let it go. (Throw me tomorrow..oh,oh). Only for you I don't regret. That I was Thursday's Child. (oh, woah). Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was (x2). Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep. Shuffling days and Lonesome nights. Sometimes my courage fell to my feet. Lucky old sun is in my sky. Nothing prepared me for your smile. Lighting the darkness of my soul. Innocence in your arms. (Oh-neh don' go). (Throw me tomorrow..oh,oh). Now that I've really got a chance. (Throw me tomorrow..oh,oh). Everything's falling into place. (Throw me tomorrow..oh,oh). Seeing my past to let it go. (Yeah, throw me tomorrow..oh,oh). Only for you I don't regret. That I was Thursday's Child. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I."
time,"Time - He's waiting in the wings. He speaks of senseless things. His script is you and me, boy. Time - He flexes like a who. Falls wanking to the floor. His trick is you and me, boy. Time - In Quaaludes and red wine. Demanding Billy Dolls. And other friends of mine. Take your time. The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain. Incestuous and vain, and many other last names. I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think ""Oh God I'm still alive"". We should be on by now. We should be on by now. Lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai. Lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai. You - are not a victim. You - just scream with boredom. You - are not evicting time. Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old. You'll freeze and catch a cold. 'Cause you've left your coat behind. Take your time. Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful. I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs. But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless. The door to dreams was closed. Your park was real greenless. Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness. But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming. We should be on by now. We should be on by now. We should be on by now. We should be on by now. We should be on by now. Lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai. Lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai, lai.

time will crawl,"I've never sailed on a sea. I would not challenge a giant. I could not take on the church. Time will crawl. Till the 21st century lose. I know a government man. He was as blind as the moon. He saw the sun in the night. He took a top-gun pilot. He made him fly thru a hole. Till he grew real old. And he never came down. He just flew till he burst. Time will crawl till our mouths run dry. Time will crawl till our feet grow small. Time will crawl till our tails fall off. Time will crawl till the 21st century lose. I saw a black black stream. Full of white eyed fish. And a drowning man. With no eyes at all. I felt a warm warm breeze. That melted metal and steel. I got a bad migraine. That lasted three long years. And the pills that I took. Made my fingers disappear. Time will crawl, time will crawl. Time will crawl. Till the 21st century lose. You were a talented child. You came to live in our town. We never bothered to scream. When your mask came off. We only smelt the gas. As we lay down to sleep. Time will crawl and our heads bowed down. Time will crawl and our eyes fall out. Time will crawl and the streets run red. Time will crawl till the 21st century lose. Time will crawl and our mouths run dry. Time will crawl and our feet grow small. Time will crawl and our tails fall off. Time will crawl till the 21st century lose. Time will crawl and our heads bowed down. Time will crawl and our eyes fall out. Time will crawl and the streets run red. Time will crawl till the 21st century lose. For the crazy child. We'll give every life. For the crackpot notion."

tired of my life,"I don't know why but I'm tired of my mind. Pain is over me, overloading. I don't know why but you're trying to be kind. Take off your silver smile, throw your head back. And cry. I don't believe but I'm trying to decide. Which game is best for me, which can I bare. You don't perseve so I'm leading you away. Home were you've never been, non-returning. So cry. Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces. Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated. Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later. Put a bullet in my brain and I'll make all the papers. I don't know why but I'm tired of my life."

uncle arthur,"Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop. Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up. Climbs across his bike and he's away. Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street. Back to mother, it's another empty day. Uncle Arthur likes his mommy. Uncle Arthur still reads comics. Uncle Arthur follows Batman. Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum. On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum. Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed. Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion. Sally was the real thing, not just lust. Uncle Arthur vanished quickly. Uncle Arthur and his new bride. Uncle Arthur follows Sally. Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days. Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze. Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled. Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop. He gets his pocket money, he's well fed. Uncle Arthur past the gasworks. Uncle Arthur past the river. Uncle Arthur down the high street."

waiting for the man,"I'm waiting for my man. Twenty-six dollars in my hand. Up to Lexington 1-2-5. So sick and dirty more dead than alive. I'm waiting for my man. Hey white boy, what you doin' uptown. Hey white boy, you chasin' our women around. Oh pardon me sir, it springs to my mind. I'm just looking for a good friendly behinde. I'm waiting for my man. Here he comes, he's all dressed in black. Real shoes and a big straw hat. He's never early, he's always late. First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait. I'm waiting for my man.

watch that man,"Shakey threw a party that lasted all night. Everybody drank a lot of something nice. There was an old fashioned band of married men. Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so. The ladies looked bad but the music was sad. No one took their eyes off Lorraine. She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll. Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so. Yeah! it was time to unfreeze. When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees. Slam! so it wasn't a game. Cracking all the mirrors in shame. Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man. Well he talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon. Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man. Well he walks like a jerk. But he's only taking care of the room. Must be in tune. A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands. So Shakey hung him up to dry. The pundits were joking the manholes were smoking. And every bottle battled with the reason why. The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone. A throw back from someone's LP. A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag. And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding. Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf. For I couldn't understand the conversation. Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information. Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man. He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon. Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man. He walks like a jerk. But he's only taking care of the room. Must be in tune. Watch that man. Watch that man. Oh ah oh. Watch that man. Oh oh oh. Watch that man. oooh ooh. Watch that man. oh (Watch that man). (Watch that man). (Watch that man). (Watch that man). (Watch that man) oh oh. (Watch that man)."
we all go through,Skeletal city highs. Crazies with dumb replies. Nobody's eyes anymore. Frown on your beggar's face. Walking this lunarscape. Nothing in my lackaday. Chorus. We'll all be right. We'll all be right. We'll all be right in the now. We all go through. We all go through. We all go through it sometimes. Somebody's space to rent. Somebody's soul to dent. Dog is in every word. Hiding the flames of power. Hiding us home by home. Nearly got out yesterday. Chorus. Trouble it travels on the wing. Doorway to door. Open your eyes. Nothing remains. A secret love between us. Nothing can hide for long. We are the morning song. Holding my breath anyway. Chorus (x2)
we are hungry men,"When I live my dream, I'll take you with me. Riding on a golden horse. We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you. Happy at the sound of your voice. Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you. Or banish wicked giants from the land. But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you. We will only love each other as forever. When I live my dream. When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me. And the empty man you left behind. It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me. Only love can live in my dream. I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish. Wish, and the storm will fade away. Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture. And trees will play the rhythm of my dream. When I live my dream, please be there to meet me. Let me be the one to understand. When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me. Then we can live in our new land. Till the day my dream cascades around me. I'm content to let you pass me by. Till that day, you'll run to many other men. But let them know it's just for now. Tell them that I've got a dream. And tell them you're the starring role. Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guyaVoice: Here is the news. According to the latest world population survey. The figures have reached danger point, my god. London 15 million 75 thousand. New York 80 million. Paris 15 million and 30. China 1000 million. Braidlington-Spa lots. My studies included suffragy. I formed my own society. to crush the bear of fecundity. The world will overpopulate. Unless you claim infertility. So who will buy a drink for me, your messiah. We are not your friends. We don't give a damn for what you're saying. We're here to live our lives. I propose to give the pill. Free of charge to those that feel. That they are not infertible. The kroks of you, the cattle gun. There's only one way to linger on. So who will buy a drink for me, your messiah. We are not your friends. We don't give a damn for what you're saying. We're here to live our lives. Voice:. Achtung, achtung, these are your orders. Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air. Will be slaughtered and cremated. Only one cubic foot of air is allowed .... I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion. We will turn a blind eye to infanticide. We are not your friends. We don't give a damn for what you're saying. We're here to live our lives. You don't seem to hear me clear. Do I talk above your sphere?. Let me explain my project , dear. Show you how I'll save the world. Or let it die within the year. Why do you look that way at me, your messiah. We are not your friends. We don't give a damn for what you're saying. We're here to live our lives. We are hungry men. We don't give a damn for what you're saying. We're here to eat you. And I'm going to make my dream. Tell them I will live my dream.

we are the dead,"Something kind of hit me today. I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way. People will hold us to blame. It hit me today, it hit me today. We're taking it hard all the time. Why don't we pass it by?. Just reply, you've changed your mind. We're fighting with the eyes of the blind. Taking it hard, taking it hard. Yet now. We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly. They tell me ""Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"". For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin. For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy. You're just an ally of the leecher. Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps. And your nimble dress that trails. Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails. Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said. We are the dead. One thing kind of touched me today. I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid. Pressing our love through the night. Knowing it's right, knowing it's right. Now I'm hoping someone will care. Living on the breath of a hope to be shared. Trusting on the sons of our love. That someone will care, someone will care. But now. We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature. Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell. It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell. And the streets are full of press men. Bent on getting hung and buried. And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt. Who sucks you while you're sleeping. It's the theater of financiers. Count them, fifty 'round a table. White and dressed to kill. Oh caress yourself, my juicy. For my hands have all but withered. Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs. Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said. We are the dead. We are the dead"

what's really happening,"Grown inside a plastic box. Micro thoughts and safety locks. Hearts become outdated clocks. Ticking in your mind. Now it's time to close our eyes. Now it's time to say goodbye. Now it's time to face the lie. That we'd never cry. What's really happening, what tore us apart. What's really happening. What's really happening, what tore us apart. What's really happening. All the clouds are made of glass. And they're slowly sinking. Falling like the shattered past. Were we built to last?. What's really happening, what tore us apart.

when i met you,You have just everything. But nothing at all. Now the moon is dark. Feels like pain again. You could feel my breath. You opened my eyes. For I could not see. When I met you. When I met you (you're feeling depressed). I could not speak (ou're drowning in pain). You opened my mouth (you're walking in midst). You opened my heart (you're leaving again). My spirit shows (she tore you down). The marks and stains (happens all the same). Could not exist (you were afraid). When I met you. Now it's all the same. It's all the same. The sun is gone. It's all the same. But when I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. You were afraid (when I met you). She stole your heart (when I met you). You don't understand (when I met you). Should be ashamed (when I met you). You should have walked. (I was the walking dead). She tore you down (I was kicked in the head). She tore you down. Did you actually become. The center of my world. The seams of my life. The streams of daydream. Like the wounds of a friend. Another the kiss of a foe. The pack of a blackened eye. A life or the crown. When I met you. I could not speak. How I met you. Then I met you. My spirit grows. My kind of truth. Could not exist. When I met you. How it's all the same. It's all the same. The sun is gone. It's all the same. But when I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. When I met you. I was the walking dead. I was kicked in the head. It was such a time. It was such a time. I was crushed inside. I was torn inside. When I met you. When I met you. I was too insane. Could not trust a thing. I was off my head. I was filled with truth. It was not god's truth. Before I met you
when i'm five,"When I'm five. I will wash my face me hands all by myself. When I'm five. I will chew and spit tabacco like my grandfather Jones. 'Cause I'm only four and five is far away. When I'm five. I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer. When I'm five. I will walk behind the soldiers in the May Day parade. 'Cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast. Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin. And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August. Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast. And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled. I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five. When I'm five. I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick. When I'm five. I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum. And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up. If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me. I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tricycle. And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop. Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me. I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five. I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five. When I'm five. When I'm five."
when the wind blows,"So long child, I'm on my way. And after all is done, after all is done. Don't be down, it's all in the past. Though you may be afraid. So long child, it's awful dark. And I've never felt the sun. I daren't to think of when. When the wind blows. When the wind blows. When the wind blows. Life burns a savage wound, angry and wrong. Trusting a twisted word, you'll run, run away. You'll take him home. You'll spit and taunt him. But they won't believe you. No matter what you'll say. So long child, it's awful dark. I never felt the sun. I daren't to think of when. When the wind blows. When the wind blows"
when you rock'n' roll with me,"You always were the one that knew. They sold us for the likes of you. I always wanted new surroundings. A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat.

I'm in tears again. When you rock 'n' roll with me. Gentle hearts are counted down. The queue is out of sight and out of sounds. Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting. I've found a door which lets me out!. When you rock 'n' roll with me. No one else I'd rather be. Nobody down here can do it for me. I'm in tears again. When you rock 'n' roll with me. Oooo-oo-oo-oo. Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me,. There's no one else I'd rather be, oh. Nobody down here can do it for me. When you rock 'n' roll with me. When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me.

where have all the good times gone,In my life I've never stopped to worry about a thing. Opened up and shouted out and never tried to see. Wondering if I'd done wrong (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu). Will this depression last for long. Won't you tell me. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same. Time was on our side and I had everything to gain. Let it be like yesterday (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu). Please let me have happy days. Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do. Didn't have no money and they always told the truth. Daddy didn't have no toys (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu). And Mummy didn't need no boys. Won't you tell me. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play. But let's face it things are so much easier today. Guess you need some bringing down (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu). Get your feet back on the ground. Won't you tell me. Where have all the good times gone.

wild eyed boy from freecloud,"Solemn faced, the village settles down, undetected by the stars. And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep. And the last thing on his mind. Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned neath the covered wooden shaft. Folds the rope into its bag. Blows his pipe of smolders, blankets smoke into the room. And the day will end for some as the night begins for one. Staring through the message in his eyes, lies a solitary son. From the mountain called Freecloud where the eagle dare not fly. And the patience in his sigh. gives no indication for the townsmen to decide. So the village Dreadful yawns. pronouncing gross diversion as the label for the dog. oh it's the madness in his eyes as he breaks the night to cry. It's really me. Really you and really me. It's so hard for us to really be. Really you and really me. You'll lose me though I'm always really free. And the mountain moved its eyes. To the world of realize. Where the snow had saved a place. For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud. And the village Dreadful cried. As the rope began to rise. For the smile stayed on the face. Of the Wild Eyed Boy from freecloud. And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crown. As the boulders smashed down from the mountains hand. And the magic in the stare of the Wild Eyed Boy said. Stop, freecloud! They won't think to cut me down. But the cottages fell like the playing card hell. The tears on the face of a Wise Boy. Came trembling down to the rumbling ground. And the missionary mystic of peace/love. Stumbled back to cry among the clouds. Kicking back the pebbles. From the Freecloud mountain track."

without you,Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand. Just when the best things in life are gone. I look into your eyes. There's no smoke without fire. You're exactly who I want to be with.

What would I do
without you i'm nothing,"Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide. I'll take it by your side. Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide. I'll take it by your side. Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies. I'll take it by your side. Over-saturation curls the skin and tans the hide. I'll take it by your side. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tick. Tick, tick, tick. Tick, tick, tick. Tick, tock. Tick. I'm unclean, a libertine. And every time you vent your spleen. I seem to lose the power of speech. You're slipping slowly from my reach. You grow me like an evergreen. You've never see the lonely me at all. I. Take the plan, spin it sideways. I. Fall. Without you, I'm nothing. Without you, I'm nothing. Without you, I'm nothing. Take the plan, spin it sideways"

working class hero,As soon as you're born they make you feel small. By giving you no time instead of it all. Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. They hurt you at home and they hit you at school. They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool. Till you're so fucking crazy you can't fallow their rules. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years. Ah then they expect you to pick a career. When you can't really function you're so full of fear. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV. And you think you're so clever and classless and free. But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. There's room at the top they are telling you still. But first you must smile as you kill. But if you want to be like the folks on the hill. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. If you want to be a hero well just follow me. If you want to be a hero well just follow me.

you can't talk,"Hoo. Beauty shrieks ""Beast in booties"". Coming home so lay the table. Look at you calling shots. Call you over under out. I was under, backwards, forwards. Holding hands in the dark. Kissing some, kissing cousins. Kissing this in cover. Kissing cousins, kissing that. Over under out. Over under out. You can't talk. You can't see me drowning.

you feel so lonely you could die,"No one ever saw you moving through the dark. Leaving slips of paper somewhere in the park. Hidden from your friends, stealing all they knew. Love is thrown in airless rooms. Thin vile rewards for you. And I'm gonna tell. Yes, I've gotta tell. Gotta tell the things you've said. When you're talking in the dark. And I'm gonna tell the things you've done. When you're walking through the park. Some night on a thrill-less street. Will come a silent gun. You've got a dangerous part. You stole their trust, their moon, their sun. They'll come such a dart and it's needle on a crowded train. I bet you'll feel so lonely. You could die. Buildings crammed with people, landscape filled with wrath. Grey concrete city, rain has wet the street. I want to see you clearly before you close the door. A room of bloody history, you made sure of that. I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam. I can read you like a book. I can feel you falling. I hear you moaning in your room. Oh, see if I care. Oh please, please make it soon. Walls have got you cornered. You've got the blues my friend. And people don't like you. But you will leave without a sound or a God, an end. Oh hopefully, I love you. Death along shall love you. I bet you'll feel so lonely you could die. You feel so lonely you could die. You feel so lonely you could die"
you've been around,Where's the pain in the violent night?. I'm depressed by the grill. I stay over many years. I should have thought of that. For the love of the money. Like a black-hearted vile thing. It's the nature of being. It's too many lonely nights. I can't tell bad from wrong. I can't pass you by. Too exchanging. You've been around. But you've changed me. When the flesh meets the spirit world. Where the traffic is thin. I slip from a vacant view. I should have thought of that. And the sound of tomorrow. Like a black-hearted vile thing. Like the silence of tension. It's too many lonely nights. I can't tell good from bad. I can't pass you by. Too exchanging. You've been around. But you've changed me. You've been around. Can't pass you by. You've been around. But you've changed me. Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!. Too exchanging. You've been around. but you've changed me. You've been around. can't pass you by.

you've got a habit of leaving,"You've got a habit of leaving me. And you've got a habit of deserting me. Sometimes I cry. Sometimes I'm so sad. Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad.

young americans,"They pulled in just behind the bridge. He lays her down, he frowns. ""gee my life's a funny thing. Am I still too young? "". He kissed her then and there. She took his ring, took his babies. It took him minutes, took her nowhere. Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but. All night. She wants the young american. Young american, young american. She wants the young american. All right. She wants the young american. Scanning life through the picture windows. She finds the slinky vagabond. He coughs as he passes her ford mustang, but. Heaven forbid, she'll take anything. But the freak, and his type, all for nothing. He misses a step and cuts his hand, but. Showing nothing, he swoops like a song. She cries ""; where have all papa's heroes gone? "". All night. She wants the young american. Young american, young american. She wants the young american. All right. She wants the young american. All the way from washington. Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor. ""we live for just these twenty years. Do we have to die for the fifty more? "". All night. He wants the young american. Young american, young american. He wants the young american. All right. He wants the young american. Do you remember, your president nixon?. Do you remember, the bills you have to pay. Or even yesterday?. Have you been an un-american?. Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout. Leather, leather everywhere, and. Not a myth left from the ghetto. Well, well, well, would you carry a razor. In case, just in case of depression. Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors. Blushing at all the afro-sheeners. Ain't that close to love?. Well, ain't that poster love?. Well, it ain't that barbie doll. Her heart's been broken just like you have. And. All night. You want the young american. Young american, young american. You want the young american. All right. You want the young american. You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler. A pimp's got a cadi and a lady's got a chrysler. Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train. Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache. I heard the news today, oh boy. I got a suite and you got defeat. Ain't there a man you can say no more?. And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?. And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?. Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?. Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?. Ain't there one damn song that can make me. Break down and cry?. All night. I want the young american. Young american, young american. I want the young american. All right. I want the young american. Young american. Young american, young american. I want the young american. (I want with you, I want with you want). All right.

And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames. Now tomorrow's back claiming redemption is on your heels. And a toothless past is asking you how it feels.

ziggy stardust,Ziggy played guitar. jamming good with Weird and Gilly. And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand. But made it too far. Became the special man. then we were Ziggy's band. Ziggy really sang. screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo. Like some cat from Japan. he could lick 'em by smiling. He could leave 'em to hang. Came on so loaded man. well hung and snow white tan. So where were the spiders while. the fly tried to break our balls. Just the beer light to guide us. So we bitched about his fans and. should we crush his sweet hands?. Ziggy played for time. Jiving us that we were voodoo. The kids were just crass. he was the nazz. With God given ass. He took it all too far but. boy could he play guitar. Making love with his ego. Ziggy sucked up into his mind. Like a leper messiah. When the kids had killed the man. I had to break up the band. Ziggy played gui... tar
