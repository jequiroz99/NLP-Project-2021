world so cold,"It starts with pain, followed by hate. Fueled by the endless questions no one can answer. A stain covers your heart and tears you apart. Just like a sleeping cancer. I don't believe men are born to be killers. I don't believe the world can be saved. How did you get here and when did it start?. An innocent child with a thorn in his heart. What kind of world do we live in?. Where love is divided by hate. Loosing control of our feelings. We all must be dreaming this life away. In a world so cold. Are you sane, where's the shame?. A moment of time passes by you cannot rewind. Who's to blame and where did it start?. Is there a cure for your sickness. Have you no heart?. I don't believe men are born to be killers. I don't believe the world can't be saved. How did you get here and when did it start?. An innocent child with a thorn in his heart. What kind of world do we live in?. Where love is divided by hate. Selling our soul for no reason. We all must be dreaming this life away. In a world so cold, In a world so cold. There's a sickness inside you that wants to escape. It's a feeling you get when you can't find your way. So how many times must you fall to your knees?. Never, never, never, never, never do this again. It starts with pain, followed by hate. No I don't believe men are born to be killers. I don't believe that the world can't be saved. What kind of world do we live in. Where love is divided by hate. Losing control of our feeling. We're dreaming this life away. What kind of world do we live in. Where love is divided by hate. Selling our soul for no reason. We all must be dreaming this life away. In a world so cold. In a world so cold"
broken,Freedom!. Alone again again alone. Patiently waiting by the phone. Hoping that you will call me home. The pain inside my love denied. Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride. Everything I need it lies in you. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. I question why you chose to die. When you knew your truth I would deny. You look at me. The tears begin to fall. And all in all faith is blind. But I fail time after time. Daily in my sin I take your life. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. All the hate deep inside. Slowly covering my eyes. All these things I hide. Away from you again. All this fear holding me. My heart is cold and I believe. Nothing's gonna change. Until I'm broken. This time. Let go!. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. Broken. Broken. Broken. Broken

Like there's nothing left to say and I pretend to. Look the other way but in the end will I be okay,. Will I be okay. Father father will you be there as I cry out. Silent again turning colder, frozen deeper,. Numb to this dream sleeping within. Before I face another day, won't you let stay asleep,. Lost among the dreams that always comfort me. And before I find my feet, won't you show me. What I need, what I need to walk again"

Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. I'll become what I am because of you,. It was you,. I'm so sorry about the ways,. That I can't take away my past,. But you loved me anyway,. And now I want to do,. Everything for you that I can,. Even though it won't erase,. The foolish things that I've done,. Things that blinded me,. But now I see,. It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. And I'll stand for what I know is real,. So how can I make this up to you,. I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive,. Now that I'm living my life for you,. I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive,. Can't you see,. It was you,. That showed me who I am,. And taught me how to stand,. For what I know is real,. Now I'm breathing for the first time,. And I'm leavin all this behind,. I'll become what I am because of you,.

I know what's weighing on your mind. There's nothing you can do so. Stand up get up back up. You're reaching out just to be like me. But you've fallen short. Still you're following me. You had the chance to bring me down. But there's nothing left. So just stay away from me. You can't stand to see my face. To know you'll never take my place. There's nothing you can do but. Stand up get up back up now. Just stay away. I feel the hate you push on me. I see the things that you can't see. I know what's on your mind so. Stand up get up back up. It's not the things you say to me. It's not the things that I believe. You try to bring me down. So stand up get up back up now Just stay away.
waiting for yesterday,"It's a long way back to reality, she puts another. Brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago. Trying to figure out where things went wrong. Searching through all the lies she told. Somehow she missed out on all the things that. She needed most days spent wondering why this. Life is so cold and nothing ever changes. Screaming for attention, watch the sun steal. Yesterday. Hiding all emotion far away. Trying to find his self confidence, another. Broken heart behind the painless smile that he. Shows reminded that yesterday is so far gone. And tomorrow is still a miracle somehow he. Missed out on all the things he needed most days. Spent wondering why this life is so cruel and. Nothing ever changes. Tomorrow's still a miracle"

'Cause you're already gone. Because in this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. I'm awake, I saw you in my dreams. You came to me and never turned away. To be okay, something's gotta change. 'Cause with the lights on I still feel the same. I can't see you walk away. Tell me where did I go wrong?. Because in this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. In this life I have to choose. Between losing me and losing you. It's so unfair I do this on my own. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. I stumble, you don't let me fall. Maybe you love me after all. I'll take whatever brings you back. Nobody makes me feel like that. Please don't ever let me lose your light. In this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. In this life I have to choose. Between losing me and losing you. It's so unfair I do this on my own. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. Now I see through open eyes. That without you here lately I'm blind. I'm okay and patiently I wait"
blessing,Offer my hand you spit in my face. Blinded by failures you can't face the shame. The walls of your fortress come tumbling down. You cry for a savior no ones around. Paint me a picture of how things went wrong. 'cause this violence play your favorite song. Swim through the void as black as your soul. Never forget. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. Glued to the past a moth to a flame. Where will you hide. When you can't shift the blame. The further you fall the more that I gain. Never forget you've caused this pain. You feel. Burning deep inside of you. Behind the veil. Never take control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace
the way i feel,"Lately I've been wandering. Off the narrow path. You've given me so many things that I've never had. And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through.

And I promise to make the sacrifice, Yeah!. (Come on). The world I know is pulling me. More and more each day. I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray. Spiteful eyes are watching me. With everything I do. In the midst of darkness Lord. My spirit calls for you. ‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life. Yes I hate the way I feel inside. And I promise to make the sacrifice, Yeah!. (You know sometimes deep inside). I feel like this. ‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life.

So alive as you open up your mind. As you break away from everything. All that's stopping you. For the night. I'm putting up a fight. I've opened up my eyes. To see a world a I never knew. Time to fly. Time to kiss your fears goodbye. Time to take control and realize. This world was made for you. There's a time in everybody's life. When nothing's going right for you. Take a chance. Take a step out on the ledge. Take a good look down. And realize it's all for you. For the night. I'm putting up a fight. I've opened up my eyes. To see a world a I never knew. Time to fly.

broken road,"Time moves slowly while you're gone. I haven't heard your voice in quite sometime. But I still see your face. I cannot erase the things you've done. And all the ways you caught me hangin on. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. I know it hurts to hear the truth. Well maybe I was never meant to be with you. And I cannot replace the tears of disgrace. That run for you. 'Cause running from the truth is what you do. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. You're all that I've ever known. And I cannot replace all these tears of disgrace. And I won't bleed for you anymore. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go.

anthem for the underdog,You say you know just who I am. But you can't imagine. What waits for you across the line. You thought you had me. But I'm still here standing. And I'm tired of backing down. And I'm here now feelin' the pain. Of a thousand hearts. Been to hell and back again. I won't take this. You try so hard to bring me down. You can't break the broken. You still don't seem to understand. It's your turn to see just. How it feels to be me. How it feels to be knocked down. And you're here now feeling the pain. Of a thousand hearts. You've been to hell and back again. You can't take this. Remember. This feeling. How it feels to be alive. Now you see me through my eyes. And we're here now feeling the beat. Of a thousand hearts. Coming back to life again. We can make it. Remember. This feeling. Remember...

back up,. I hear the words you say to me. I see the way you look at me. I know what's on your mind so. Stand up get up back up now. Just stay away. I know the fear you hold inside. I know what's weighing on your mind. There's nothing you can do so. Stand up get up back up. You're reaching out just to be like me. But you've fallen short. Still you're following me. You had the chance to bring me down. But there's nothing left. So just stay away from me. You can't stand to see my face. To know you'll never take my place. There's nothing you can do but. Stand up get up back up now. Just stay away. I feel the hate you push on me. I see the things that you can't see. I know what's on your mind so. Stand up get up back up. It's not the things you say to me. It's not the things that I believe. You try to bring me down. So stand up get up back up now Just stay away.
bitter,"Mother mother can you hear me,I keep trying. Just to find me all I know now, all you show me,. Endless questions, hopeless ending. This bitter pill is pushing me away and now I feel. Like there's nothing left to say and I pretend to. Look the other way but in the end will I be okay,. Will I be okay. Father father will you be there as I cry out. Silent again turning colder, frozen deeper,. Numb to this dream sleeping within. Before I face another day, won't you let stay asleep,. Lost among the dreams that always comfort me. And before I find my feet, won't you show me. What I need, what I need to walk again"
blessing,Offer my hand you spit in my face. Blinded by failures you can't face the shame. The walls of your fortress come tumbling down. You cry for a savior no ones around. Paint me a picture of how things went wrong. 'cause this violence play your favorite song. Swim through the void as black as your soul. Never forget. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. Glued to the past a moth to a flame. Where will you hide. When you can't shift the blame. The further you fall the more that I gain. Never forget you've caused this pain. You feel. Burning deep inside of you. Behind the veil. Never take control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. No. You will never change. No no. You will never change. You've lost control of me. Never change who I am. Lies will never hide the truth. Pain is a blessing in disguise. I shiver at the thought of you. Now I'll see you on your way. As you fall from grace
blind,"I'm not okay but patiently I wait. I sit here hoping that we will be saved. Am I too late or am I just in time?. It's just too dark to see through blinded eyes. And I can't see you walk away. 'Cause you're already gone. Because in this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. I'm awake, I saw you in my dreams. You came to me and never turned away. To be okay, something's gotta change. 'Cause with the lights on I still feel the same. I can't see you walk away. Tell me where did I go wrong?. Because in this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. In this life I have to choose. Between losing me and losing you. It's so unfair I do this on my own. 'Cause love is always hard to find. But without you here lately, I'm blind. I stumble, you don't let me fall. Maybe you love me after all. I'll take whatever brings you back. Nobody makes me feel like that. Please don't ever let me lose your light. In this dark you are my light. The one that brings me back to life. I won't be okay doing this all alone. In this life I have to choose. Between losing me and losing you.

broken,Freedom!. Alone again again alone. Patiently waiting by the phone. Hoping that you will call me home. The pain inside my love denied. Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride. Everything I need it lies in you. 'Cause I'm broken. I know I need you now. 'Cause deep inside I'm broken. You see the way I live. I know I know your heart is broken. When I turn away. I need to be broken. Take the pain away. I question why you chose to die. When you knew your truth I would deny. You look at me. The tears begin to fall. And all in all faith is blind.

broken road,"Time moves slowly while you're gone. I haven't heard your voice in quite sometime. But I still see your face. I cannot erase the things you've done. And all the ways you caught me hangin on. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. I know it hurts to hear the truth. Well maybe I was never meant to be with you. And I cannot replace the tears of disgrace. That run for you. 'Cause running from the truth is what you do. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go. At the end of a broken road. You're all that I've ever known. And I cannot replace all these tears of disgrace. And I won't bleed for you anymore. Now you're gone, I moved on. And I don't feel so sorry. Can't you see I'm bleeding, but I won't bleed anymore. I held on for so long now. But I had to let you go.

And I deny myself to prove my heart is true. And I feel like I'm falling. Farther every day. But I know that you're there. Watching over me. And I feel like I'm drowning. The waves crashing over me. But I know that your love. It will set me free. I hear your voice calling. The time has come for me. Inside this life I'm living. There's nothing left for me. My mind is slowly fading. So far away from me. Each time I start crawling. You're there watching me. And I feel like I'm falling. Farther every day. But I know that you're there. Watching over me. And I feel like I'm drowning. The waves crashing over me. But I know that your love. It will set me free. . Por: @rafael_lm

Won't you leave your touch on this heart that's broken,. I can't breathe when you're not here,. Hey love won't you lift me up on the wings that fly high,. And on the stars that shine above,. Hey hey love,. Thinkin back on all the things we've done,. We watched the waves drown the sun,. We shared the dreams that both of us had seen,. Made it a reality,. We found a way to stand the test of time,. All of our doubts were left behind,. If you never love, than you may never loose,. And I hope i'll always be with you,. And I'm screaming,. Hey love,.

hey man,"You're waiting for someone to guide your steps. Reality won't let you catch your breath. You beg and you plead just to catch a break. To never be free with the choices you made. Fall down, give up, you hesitate. Destined to repeat the same mistakes. But in my mind I believe that it is your time. To pick yourself up and get back in the race. Hey, man are you too afraid to lead the way. Into the waters that drown the weak. Facing the nightmares that steal your sleep. Hey, man are you strong enough to face the pain. Rise to the challenge that lies ahead. Or will you give in again. Just open your eyes and then take the leap. You're in control of your destiny. Doing your best doesn't mean you'll succeed. You'll always fail if you live on your knees. If you fall down, you can get up. Don't hesitate. Refuse to repeat all the same mistakes. If in your mind you believe. That it is your time. To pick yourself back up. And get back in the race. Hey, man are you too afraid to lead the way. Into the waters that drown the weak. Facing the nightmares that steal your sleep. Hey, man are you strong enough to face the pain. Rise to the challenge that lies ahead. Or will you give in again. Hey, man are you too afraid to lead the way. Into the waters that drown the weak. Facing the nightmares that steal your sleep. Hey, man are you strong enough to face the pain. Rise to the challenge that lies ahead. Or will you give in again. Give in again"
home,In my eyes you see the pain. With each lie I take the blame. With each sigh I slowly fall away. You are there when I need you. You sew me up when I bleed through. The endless cloth of lies surrounding me. Everything that I am you have given me. The lessons that I've learned are bringing me home. It's everything that I need. It's all the truth that I believe. Right where I need to be. Just bring me home. I hide in darkness blind to sense. Chasing a dream with false pretense. Help me find the fracture in this dark sky.

i'm with you,"Close your eyes my lonely friend. I sympathize but look deep within. Think of your life where it begins. It's not the end. It's not the end. Take a step and don't look down. You can turn it all around. Would it change things if you knew. I'm with you. I'm with you. I know it hurts, you're broken inside. But no kind of pain's worth more than a life. Take the first step and breathe in again. It's not the end. It's not the end. Take a step and don't look down. You can turn it all around. Would it change things if you knew. I'm with you.

if i could,You've gone too far. To fall apart. I know it's hard to see. Through today. You gave it all. You broke your heart. When I was here. And I promise you. If I could be everything to you. I would find a way 2x. If I could proove. That you felt the same. I would be the one 2x. If I could. I felt this thing. For far too long. And now it's going to bless. You never knew. You held my heart inside your hand. I've never felt like this. And I promise you. (Chorus). Cause I would never do. The things he did to you. I would never let you go. (Chorus)
in closing,"Step back inside the lie again, you'll find you're. Wearing thin. Killing the sympathy as you take another swing. At me now. Fighting your inner self again, losing what. You feel. Shielded behind the lies that make you feel real. Now. It's over and i don't feel a thing but you're. Trying to break the scar again your spirit is. Bleeding as you grin but your bridge keeps on. Burning at both ends. In your mind, the ending seems to be so far from. What you need. Take back the memories as you smile to hide the. Pain from me now. Shut down the curiosity that brings you here. Again. No sense of purity as you try to take the life. From me now. Nothing that you ever say could ever possibly. Erase. All the hateful things you did and now i'm. Through with you nothing you could ever say. Nothing you could ever say. Hope you're happy now"
in my head,I'm reaching out without a sound. My pride falls to the floor again. Inside my mind I search to find. A place just to call my own. Deep inside your eyes. I am blinded by your love. Still I run so far just to find that. I'm alone again. In my head. I hear you calling me. And I can't run ‘cause there's nothing left for me. When I fall you always follow me deep inside. Deep inside. Deep inside of my head. I just can't last as these feelings pass. Once again I hide the pain inside. The smile wears thin and the lies begin. To bring me down again. When I run I run so far away from you. I hide the pain and all the lies deep inside again. And all my faith I put in you. This time you take it all away. Inside my head. Deep inside. My head

How can we fly when we clip our own wings?. How can we drown out all the sounds of hate. When everybody screams. ""what has this world done for me? "". We close our eyes as the kids are dying. We pull the shades and lock the doors. We all complain as we sit in silence. We cheat the game while keeping score. Get in line and set the outcome. Feed the rich and rob the poor.

How can i love if i hate all of you?
soulfire,Every morning as I wake to another day. I bow my head hit my knees and I begin to pray. I search for answers that I wonder if I'll ever find. Running circles in the mazes deep inside my mind. You always take me to a higher level. Show something that's deep inside. You show me things I never knew. You push me you pull me. You set my soul on fire. You take me so much higher. Higher again. Thank you for it all. Everyday living this life not knowing what it means. Consolation from above fulfilling all my dreams. And as I look across the crowd in their eyes I see. All their troubles and their pain staring back at me. You always take me to a higher level. You show me something that's deep inside. You show me things I never knew. You push me you pull me. You always give the best for me. Lift your hands high right where I can see. You always give the best for me. Lift your hands high right where I can see
speak your mind,"How does it make you feel when i look away. Feelings that will never seem to fade i try to. Find you, you hold your head up high i let it all. Fall down do you hear me. Falling away from his pain so i can fly high,. Feeling low just let it show. And find the words to say what you mean. Screaming silent fears, nothing left to say, lost. Inside the words that bring you donw you try to. Find me, i hold my head up high, you let it all fall. Down do you hear me. Find the words to say how you feel inside. Find the words to say how you feel inside. Find the words to say"
stay,"I walk to the edge again, searching for the truth. Taken by the memories of all that I've been through. If I could hear your voice I know I would be okay. I know that I've been wrong but I'm begging you to stay. Would you stay?. Will you be here or will I be alone?. Will I be scared? you'll teach me how to be strong. And if I fall down will you help me carry on. I cannot do this alone. I wish that I could turn back time. Just to have one more chance. To be the man I need to be,. I pray you'll understand. If I could hear your voice. I know I would be okay. I know that I've been wrong. But I'm begging you to stay. Would you stay?. Will you be here or will I be alone?. Will I be scared?. You'll teach me how to be strong. And if I fall down will you help me carry on. I cannot do this alone. I need your hand to help me through again. Nothing compares to how I feel when I look at you. You never know, you never know tomorrow. You never know, you never know tomorrow. Don't walk away. Will you be here or will I be alone?. Will I be scared?. You'll teach me how to be strong. And if I fall down will you help me carry on. I cannot do this alone. (2x). I am not alone I know you're there (3x). I am not alone."
that changes everything,"I wish that we could start over. Change everything that went wrong. It's hard to stay sober. When you feel like love is gone. We both need forgiveness. And we both need to forgive. The past that hangs above our heads. Will drive us to the end. All the things we should have done. All the times I tried to run from you. If I fall from the ledge. I don't wanna die with regrets. I see the ground coming. I'm not gonna run anymore. I can make my amends. I swear I won't fail you again. I was ready to die. 'till I saw you suffering. And that changes everything. The pieces come together. The images burned in my mind. Everything seems much clearer. But this place I can't recognize. Oblivious to the ending. The shame has covered my eyes. Haunted by my feelings. Imprisoned by my denial. All the things we should have done. All the times I tried to run from you. If I fall from the ledge. I don't Wanna die with regrets. I see the ground coming. I'm not gonna run anymore. I can make my amends. I swear I won't fail you again. I was ready to die. 'till I saw you suffering. And that changes everything. Standing on top of the world. Looking down, looking down. Searching for something that we haven't found. Haven't found. If I fall from the ledge. I don't wanna die with regrets. I see the ground coming. I'm not gonna run anymore. I can make my amends. I swear I won't fail you again. I was ready to die. 'till I saw you suffering. And that changes everything"
the killer,Say you love and hate me. As you desecrate me. Break me down with a smile. Feel it creeping closer. The rich taking over. You're out for blood with fire in your lungs. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive. Swear I hate to do this. With the same excuses. Anger swallows me whole. You feel it creeping closer. The rich taking over. You're out for blood with fire in your lungs. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive. When the killer takes control. Over your body and your soul. Everything dies. Trapped in this hell you can't contain. Your misery becomes my pain. When I survive
the last song,I'm sorry for needing you to carry me. So simple sometimes when you're standing next. To me. You never change you never stay the same. Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with. One last song to sing. Take it all away from me and tell me how you. Want this to be. I want you i need you. A life without you made me wonder why i'm here. Until i found nothing ever seemed so clear. You never change you never stay the same. Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with. One last song to sing. I lose myself in everything you say i lose myself. In everything. I never knew that i could feel this way i never. Knew that i could feel
the one thing,"I feel it getting closer. I feel it taking over. Do you feel the same. Yeah I feel the same. The waiting takes forever. It's finally come together. Now it's in my brain. Making me insane. My feet on the ground. My head in the clouds. I'm one step away. Hope I never come down. It's the chill down my spine. The thrill that I need. I can't get enough. It's the one thing, the one thing. The burning inside. That keeps me alive. I can't give it up. It's the one thing, the one thing I need. Feels like a roller-coaster. Running free and off the track. Do you feel the same. Yeah I feel the same. This rush is like no other. A super sonic drive. And I love the way. It's making me insane. My feet on the ground. My head in the clouds. I'm one step away. Hope I never come down. It's the chill down my spine. The thrill that I need. I can't get enough. It's the one thing, the one thing. The burning inside. That keeps me alive. I can't give it up. It's the one thing, the one thing I need. It's the chill down my spine. The thrill that I need. I can't get enough. It's the one thing. It's the chill down my spine. The thrill that I need. I can't get enough. It's the one thing, the one thing. The burning inside. That keeps me alive. I can't give it up. It's the one thing, the one thing I need. The one thing I need. The one thing. The one thing"
the way i feel,"Lately I've been wandering. Off the narrow path. You've given me so many things that I've never had. And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through. If you reach deep inside you'll see my heart is true. ‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life. Yes I hate the way I feel inside. And I promise to make the sacrifice, Yeah!. (Come on). The world I know is pulling me. More and more each day. I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray. Spiteful eyes are watching me. With everything I do. In the midst of darkness Lord. My spirit calls for you. ‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life. Yes I hate the way I feel inside. And I promise to make the sacrifice, Yeah!. (You know sometimes deep inside). I feel like this. ‘Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life. Yes I hate the way I feel inside. And I promise to make the sacrifice. Yes I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life, Yeah!. The Way I feel. The Way.... The Way I feel"
this dark day,"I'm flushing down pills. I'm lost in my will. This has been haunting me way too long. And I can't rewind. I'm suffering kind. I've been abusing way too long. I'm broken, suffocating. I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away. I'll make it through my darkest day. And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs. Until this dark day is done. Now I am trapped in the way. of all my mistakes. I've been under for way too long. I'll sit in my shame. My hearts starts to race. The poison lingers in my veins. I'm broken, suffocating. I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away. I'll make it through my darkest day. And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs. Until this dark day is done. You said I'll never change. You said I never had the strength to break away. But now I've changed. It's time to take the pain and walk away. [Now to walk away]. I'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake. I made it through my darkest day. And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs. Now that this dark day is done. I'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake. I made it through my darkest day. And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs. Now that this dark day is done"
time,Time is never on your side. We must keep moving. We walk through this life so paralyzed. Our past will shake our future. The path that we choose is all our own. But only time will tell. We stand and fight. We hold the line. We chose our side. We won't compromise. If you fear the cost. The true time you lost. You're destined to fade. And you're waiting for something to change. Time is never on your side. We must keep moving. Before we fade into oblivion. If our fears and hate keep growing. We'll never shift the paradigm. But only time will tell. We stand and fight. We hold the line. We chose our side. We won't compromise. If you fear the cost. The true time you lost. You're destined to fade. And you're waiting for something to change. Underneath it all. What have we become. Will we rise or will we fall. Only time will tell. We stand and fight. We hold the line. We chose our side. We won't compromise. If you fear the cost. The true time you've lost. You're destined to fade. And you're waiting for something to change
tomorrow comes today,"Alone I face the sun. The burning has began. I live to find a way. A never ending fate. My heart is on display. And I long to find a place. A light to shine right through. All of the shadows on my face. So shine for me as one. Cast the shadow on the sun. A light to find my way. I hope tomorrow comes today. Another day goes by. Alone I wonder why. Beginning seems so close. And ending's fade away. So difficult for anyone to see. I barely recognize this image of me. And trying to hide the scars. All of them blistering on me. So shine for me as one. Cast the shadow on the sun. A light to find my way. I hope tomorrow comes today. And I won't be the one. A shadow on the sun. A light to find a way. Because tomorrow comes today. And I have the strenght to overcome. I have the will to carry on. And I'm not scared to face this one on my own, on my own. Alone I face the sun. The burning has began. A light is shinning through. And it brings me back to you. So shine for me as one. Cast the shadow on the sun. A light to find my way. I hope tomorrow comes today. And I won't be the one. A shadow on the sun. A light to find a way. Because tomorrow comes today. I hope tomorrow comes today. I hope tomorrow comes today. _Well._"
unsaid,"Sitting on the swing set. Watching days go by. Conversations about nothing. Street lights on, its time to go home. I'm not worried about tomorrow. 'Cause its only a day away. Yea, And I know its not my fault. I never dreamed this day would come. Now I'm wishing for my yesterdays. So many things are left undone. So many things are left undone. As I pull into the driveway. I feel myself go numb. And the tears of pain begin to fall. Now my worlds undone. Yea, And I know its not my fault. I never dreamed this day would come. Now I'm wishing for my yesterdays. So many things are left undone. So many things are left undone. Yes, I know its not my fault. I never dreamed this day would come. Now I'm wishing for my yesterdays. So many things are left undone. So many things are left undone. Yes you never know. You never know. You never know. You never know. You never know tomorrow. You never know. You never know. You never know. You never know.

voodoo doll,"Don't pull my strings. I wanna know who died and crowned you king. You take this way too far and all your pain. Why do you take it out on me. You take it out on me, yeah. You're lighting up candles. Flying off the handle. Your crystal ball is lying. You can't control me. You can't hold me. Over your fire. No I'm not your voodoo doll. Not a victim strangled in your cloth. You think you got me underneath your spell. With your voodoo voodoo. You're playing dirty and your magic's black. I'm pulling needles out of my back. You think you cursed me but I won't fall. 'cause I'm not your voodoo voodoo doll. You know you haunt my dreams. Your so called power is not what it seems. Your darkest hour is not mine to face.

waiting for yesterday,"It's a long way back to reality, she puts another. Brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago. Trying to figure out where things went wrong. Searching through all the lies she told. Somehow she missed out on all the things that. She needed most days spent wondering why this. Life is so cold and nothing ever changes. Screaming for attention, watch the sun steal. Yesterday. Hiding all emotion far away. Trying to find his self confidence, another. Broken heart behind the painless smile that he. Shows reminded that yesterday is so far gone. And tomorrow is still a miracle somehow he. Missed out on all the things he needed most days. Spent wondering why this life is so cruel and. Nothing ever changes. Tomorrow's still a miracle"
