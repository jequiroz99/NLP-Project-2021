farther along,"Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder. Why it should be thus all the day long. While there are others living about us. Never molested, though in the wrong. Farther along we'll know more about it. Farther along we'll understand why. Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine. We'll understand it all by and by. When death has come and taken our loved ones. Leaving our homes so lonely and drear. Then do we wonder how others prosper. Living so wicked year after year. Farther along we'll know more about it. Farther along we'll understand why.

just a little talk with jesus,"once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in. And then a little light from heaven filled my soul. It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above. And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole. (refrao). Now let us have a little talk with Jesus. Let us tell Him all about our troubles. He will hear our faintest cry. He will answer by and by. Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning. And you know a little fire is burning. You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right. Sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer. And then the cloud about me hides the light of day. The mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies. But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way. Refrao. I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears. But jesus is a freind who watches day and and night. I go to Him in prayer, He knows my every care. And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right. Refrao. You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right. Makes everything right"
