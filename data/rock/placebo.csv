every you every me,"Sucker love is heaven sent you. Pucker up our passion's spent. My heart's a tart, your body's rent. My body's broken yours is bent. Carve your name into my arm. Instead of stressed I lie here charmed. 'cause there's nothing else to do. Every me and every you. Sucker love a box I choose. No other box I choose to use. Another love I would abuse. No circumstances could excuse. In the shape of things to come. Too much poison, come undone. 'cause there's nothing else to do. Every me and every you. Every me and every you. Every me. Sucker love is known to swing. Prone to cling and waste these things. Pucker up for heaven's sake. There's never been so much at stake. I serve my head up on a plate. It's only confort, calling late. 'cos there's nothing else to do. Every me and every you. Every me and every you. Every me. Every me and every you. Every me. Like the naked leads the blind. I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind. Sucker love I always find. Someone to bruise and leave behind. All alone in space and time. There's nothing here, but what's here's mine. Something borrowed something blue. Every me and every you. Every me and every you. Every me. Every me and every you. Every me. Every me and every you. Every me. Every me and every you. Every me. Every me and every you. Every me. Every me and every you.

come home,"Stuck between the do or die. I feel emaciated. Hard to breathe I try and try. I'll get asphyxiated. Swinging from the tallest height. With nothing left to hold on to. Every sky is blue but not for me and you. Come home, come home, come home, come home. Glass and petrol vodka gin. It feels like breathing methane. Throw yourself from skin to skin. And still it doesn't dull the pain. Vanish like a lipstick trace. It always blows me away. Every cloud is grey with dreams of yesterday. Come home, come home, come home, come home. Always goes against the grain. And I can try and deny it. Give a monkey half a brain. And still he's bound to fry it. Now the happening scene is dead. I used to want to be there too. Every sky is blue but not for me and you. Come home, come home, come home, come home"

You come undone. You know, you come undone. You know, you know, you know. You don't know how you're coming across. You don't know how you're coming across. And I don't think that you're aware of the cost. So you come undone. You come. You come undone. You know, you know, you know"

And a queer threw up at at the sight of that. . Think i saw you in an ice cream parlor. Drinking milkshakes cold and long. Smiling and waving and looking so fine. Don't think you knew you were in this song. And it was cold, and it rained, so i felt like an a ctor. And i thought of ma, and i wanted to get back there. Your face, your race, the way that you talk.

Now my feet don't touch the ground X8.

Our task is to transform ourselves. into awakened multidimensional beings. Thus fulfilling our dream. The 4th and 5th dimensions to the third. It is the inner meaning between Earth. ascending and Heaven descending. This sacred magic has already. been achieved by many of us. The nameless others are awakening daily. as the cause steadfastly intensifies. We are the claiming of divine birthright and heritage. Remembering that we are angels incarnate. Vast starried beings of light. We are no longer limited and bound. by the illusions of time, space, and matter. We are ready to join as unimensions? of the one. The main doorways cannot be opened or passed. by any of us. still operating as individual units of consciousness. They are brought into manifestation. from our unified presence. Through our focused intent. Through our total commitment to serving a higher purpose. This is the bridge to an entirely different energy pattern. It is the step beyond the mound dimensional universe. It is a journey into the unknown. which shall lead us ever closer to home"

I've been washing the sand with my ghostly tears. Searching the shores for my Jackie-oh. And I remember the day that the young man came. Said, your Jackie's gone, he is lost in the rain. And I ran to the beach. And laid me down. You're all wrong, I said. And they stared to the sand. That man knows the sea like the back of his hand. He'll be back some time. Laughing at you. And I've been waiting all this time. For my man to come, take his hand in mine. And lead me away. To unsailed shores. I've been washing the sand with my salty tears. Searching the shore these long years. And I'll walk the sea forever more. 'til I find my Jackie-oh. Jackie-oh. Jackie-oh. Jackie-oh."

Patience comes to the ugly, not me. concentration comes to the ugly, not me. nothing on the box that hasn't been born. no-one in the street that isn't old. Driving in the car and I think that i'm crashing. swimming in the Sea and I think that i'll. you guessed it. only lifeguards. only lifeguards. packing all the time. can save me. waiting. waiting. waiting. for the son of man. for the son of man."
where is my mind,"With your feet in the air and your head on the ground. Try this trick and spin it, yeah. Your head will collapse. But there's nothing in it. And you'll ask yourself. Where is my mind [3x]. Way out in the water. See it swimmin'. I was swimmin' in the Carribean. Animals were hiding behind the rocks. Except the little fish. But they told me, he swears. Tryin' to talk to me to me to me. Where is my mind [3x]. Way out in the water. See it swimmin' ?. With your feet in the air and your head on the ground. Try this trick and spin it, yeah. Your head will collapse. If there's nothing in it. And you'll ask yourself. Where is my mind [3x]. Ooooh. With your feet in the air and your head on the ground. Ooooh. Try this trick and spin it, yeah. Ooooh. Ooooh"
without you i'm nothing (feat. david bowie),"Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide. I'll take it by your side. Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide. I'll take it by your side. Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies. I'll take it by your side. Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide. I'll take it by your side. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tick. Tick. Tick. Tick tock. I'm unclean, a libertine. And every time you vent your spleen. I seem to lose the power of speech. You're slipping slowly from my reach. You grow me like an evergreen. You've never seen the lonely me at all. I. Take the plan, spin it sideways. I. Fall. Without you I'm nothing. Without you I'm nothing. Without you I'm nothing. Take the plan, spin it sideways. Without you I'm nothing at all"
wouldn't it be good,"I got it bad,. You don't know how bad I got it.. You got it easy,. You don't know when you got it good.. It's getting harder. Just keeping life and soul together.. I'm sick of fighting. Even though I know I should.. The cold is biting. Through each and every nerve and fibre,. My broken spirit is frozen to the core.. Don't wanna be here no more.. [Chorus]. Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes,. Even if it was for just one day?. Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away?. Wouldn't it be good to be on your side?. The grass is always greener over there.. Wouldn't it be good if we cold live without a care?. You must be joking. You don't know a thing about it.. You've got no problem,. I'd stay right there if it were you.. I got it harder,. You couldn't dream how hard it got it.. Stay out of my shoes. If you know what's good for you.. The heat is stifling,. Burning me up from the inside,. The sweat is coming through each and every pore.. Don't wanna be here no more.. [Chorus]"
you don't care about us,"If it's a bad day, you try to suffocate.. Another memory... scarred.. If it's a bad case, then you accelerate,. you're in the getaway... car.. You don't care about us... oh oh.. You don't care about us... oh oh.. You don't care about us... oh oh. You don't care about us.. If it's a bad case, you're on the rampage.. Another memory... scarred.. You're at the wrong place, you're on the back page,. you're in the getaway... car.. You don't care about us... oh oh.. You don't care about us... oh oh.. You don't care about us... oh oh. You don't care about us.. It's your age, It's my rage.. It's your age, It's my rage.. You're too complicated, we should separate it.. You're just confiscating, you're exasperating.. This degeneration, mental masturbation.. Think I'll leave it all behind, save this bleeding heart of mine.. It's a matter of trust.. It's a matter of trust.. It's a matter of trust.. It's a matter of trust.. Because... You don't care about us.... You don't care about us.... You don't care about us.... You don't care about us.. It's your age, It's my rage.. It's your age, It's my rage.."
