airplanes (b.o.b. ft hayley williams),"(Chorus:). Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. I could use a dream or a genie or a wish. To go back to a place much simpler than this. 'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and. crashin'. And all the glitz and glam and the fashion. And all the pandemonium and all the madness. There comes a time when you fade to the blackness. And when you're starin at the phone in your lap. And you hopin' but them people never call you back. But that's just how the story unfolds. You get another hand soon after you fold. And when your plans unravel in the sand. What would you wish for if you had one chance?. So airplane airplane sorry I'm late. I'm on my way so don't close that gate. If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and. I'll be right back at it by the end of the night. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Yeah somebody take me back to the days. Before this was a job before I got paid. Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank. Yeah back when I was trying to get into the subway. And back when I was rappin for the hell of it. But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant. I'm guessing that if we could make some wishes out or. airplanes. Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days. Before the politics that we call the rap game. And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape. And back before when I tried to cover up my slang. But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray. So can I get a wish to end the politics. And get back to the music that started this shit. So here I stand and then again I say. I'm hopin we can make some wishes outa airplanes. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now (Repeat). I could really use a wish right now. I could really use a wish right now. Like, like, like shootin stars. I could really use a wish right now. A wish a wish right now"

Call me a traitor. I'm just collecting your victims. And they're getting stronger. I hear them calling. I'll stop the whole world. I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster. Eating us alive. Don't you ever wonder how we survive?. Well now that you're gone the world is ours. Well you thought of straight solutions. But I liked the tension. And not always knowing the answers. You're gonna lose it. You're gonna lose it. I'll stop the whole world. I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster. Eating us alive.

careful,"I settle down. A twisted up frown. Disguised as a smile. Well, you would've never known. I had it all, but not what I wanted. 'Cause hope for me was a place uncharted. And overgrown. You make your way in. I'd resist you just like this. You can't tell me to feel. The truth never set me free. So I did it myself. You can't be too careful anymore. When all that is waiting for you. Won't come any closer. You've got to reach out a little more. More, more, more, more. Open your eyes. Like I opened mine. It's only the real world. Life you will never know. Shifting your weight to throw off the pain. Well, you can ignore it. But only for so long. You look like I did. You resist me you just like this. You can't tell me to heal. And it hurts remembering. How it felt to shut down. Can't be too careful anymore. When all that is waiting for you. Won't come any closer. You've got to reach out a little more. More, more, more, more. The truth never set me free. The truth never set me free. The truth never set me free. So I'll do it myself. You can't be too careful anymore. When all that is waiting for you. Won't come any closer.

misguided ghosts,"(1,2,3,4). I'm going away for a while. But I'll be back, don't try to follow me. 'Cause I'll return as soon as possible. See I'm trying to find my place. But it might not be here where I feel safe. We all learn to make mistakes. And run. From them, from them. With no direction. Run from them, from them. With no conviction. 'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts. Travelling endlessly. Don't need no road. In fact they follow me. And we just go in circles. But now I'm told that this is life. And pain is just a simple compromise. So we can get what we want out of it. Someone care to classify,. A broken heart and twisted minds. So I can find someone to rely on. And run. To them, to them. Full speed ahead. Oh you are not. Useless. We are just. Misguided ghosts. Travelling endlessly. The ones we trusted the most. Pushed us far away. And there's no one rule. And we should not be the same. But I'm just a ghost. And still they echo me. They echo me,. They echo me in circles"

I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle. Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter. Yeah I'm caught in the middle. I was dreaming life away. All the while just going blind. Can't see forest for the trees. Behind the lids of my own eyes. Nostalgia's cool, but it won't help me now. A dream is good, if you don't wear it out. [Chorus]. I'm just a little bit caught in the middle. I try to keep going but it's not that simple. I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle. Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter. Yeah I'm caught in the middle. No, I don't need no help. I can sabotage me by myself. Don't need no one else. I can sabotage me by myself. I don't need no help. I can sabotage me by myself. Don't need no one else. I can sabotage me by myself. I don't need no help. I can sabatoge me by myself. Don't need no one else. I can sabotage me by myself. I don't need no help.

But I've been there before. And I, I hate to see your heart break. I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close. But I've been there before. Love happens all the time. To people who aren't kind.

I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close. But I've been there before. And I, I hate to see your heart break. I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close. But I've been there before. . For all the air that's in your lungs. For all the joy that is to come. For all the things that you're alive to feel. Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal. Oh how were you to know?. Oh how were you to know?. And I, I hate to see your heart break. I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close. But I've been there before. And I, I hate to see your heart break.

I'm carrying bricks around my neck. I can't keep my head up. Cant' see too far ahead. I can't keep my head up. It's like carrying bricks around my neck. To make you remember. It's like digging up the dead. Caouse you won't remember. How we got here. Why we are here.. When you finally decide it's worth the pain. I'm here. I never went anywhere.. Growing older, I never throught that I. Would look back and not regret a thing."

airplanes (b.o.b. ft hayley williams),"(Chorus:). Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. I could use a dream or a genie or a wish. To go back to a place much simpler than this. 'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and. crashin'. And all the glitz and glam and the fashion. And all the pandemonium and all the madness. There comes a time when you fade to the blackness. And when you're starin at the phone in your lap. And you hopin' but them people never call you back. But that's just how the story unfolds. You get another hand soon after you fold. And when your plans unravel in the sand. What would you wish for if you had one chance?. So airplane airplane sorry I'm late. I'm on my way so don't close that gate. If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and. I'll be right back at it by the end of the night. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Yeah somebody take me back to the days. Before this was a job before I got paid. Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank. Yeah back when I was trying to get into the subway. And back when I was rappin for the hell of it. But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant. I'm guessing that if we could make some wishes out or. airplanes. Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days. Before the politics that we call the rap game. And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape. And back before when I tried to cover up my slang. But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray. So can I get a wish to end the politics. And get back to the music that started this shit. So here I stand and then again I say. I'm hopin we can make some wishes outa airplanes. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars. I could really use a wish right now, a wish right. now, a wish right now (Repeat). I could really use a wish right now.

Lets pretend like its 98, like I'm eating lunch off of a Styrofoam trey. Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A. Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain. Now lets pretend like I'm on the stage. And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (Ok). And everybody know my name (B.o.B). And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang.

Now lets pretend like it was all-good.. Like I didn't live starring in a notebook.. Like I did the things I probably knew I should.. But I didn't have maybes that's why they call it. hood.. Now let's pretend like I aint got a name.. Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray.. I'm talking back before the mixtapes.. Before the videos and the deals and the fame..

Pretend he just made excuses that was so paper thin. They could blow away wit the wind. Marshal you never gone make it, makes no sense. To play the game it ain't no way that'll you win.. Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends. Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend. And it wasn't time to move in school no changing. again. He wasn't socially awakard and just strange as a. kid. He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as. shit. And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit.

Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with. this shit. And there was no one he could even aim when he's. pissed with. And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't. make it to the rap Olympics. Left to his plane and he missed it. He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley. and maybe these food stamps and WIC shit. Cause he neverrisked shit he hoped and he wished it. But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that. [Hayley Williams]. Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are. like shooting stars.

forgiveness,"You hurt me bad this time. No coming back. And I cry 'till I couldn't cry. Another heart attack. If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up. And I don't pick up when you call. 'Cause your voice is a gun. Every word is a bullet hole. Shot a hole in the sun. If I never look up maybe I'll never notice. And you, you want forgiveness. But I, I just can't do it yet. There's still a thread. That runs from your body to mine. And you can't break what you don't see. An invisible line. If I follow it down. Would we just be alright?. But it could take me all your life. To learn to love. How I thought I could love someone. I haven't even begun. If it's all up to us. We might as well give up. And you, you want forgiveness.

fox's dream of the log flume (mewithoutyou with haley williams),"Provisionally eyed. Practically alive. Mistook sign for signified. And so sins have often tried. To run him off a cliff like gadarene swine. Inside my wardrobe seem anchor bent. Wondering whether we were someone better then. Or maybe just better able to pretend. And what better means to our inevitable end?. You know?. I don't know if I know. Though some with certainty insist. No, certainty exists. Well, I'm certain enough of this. In the past fourteen years. There's only one girl I've kissed. And the blistering heat of the Asbury peer. We sat quiet as monks on the Ferris wheel. You're looking down at the water, down at the sea. I asked her ""did that ever occur in fantasy?"". ""Where you pushed little kids from the tops of the Ride?"". Then she shook her head ""no"", I said ""oh, neither do I"". And with my Grandma's ring, I went down on one knee. And the subsequent catastrophe has since haunted me. Like a fibreglass ghost. To ask of my inconveniently selective memory. Forgetfully you. Mercifully withdrew. All the bearing points we thought we knew. Days run, days set clock. Our calm is shot. We sailed waywardly on. Singing our midnight archer songs. Until well past dawn. It's still dark on the deck of our boat. Haphazardly blown. Broken bows, our aimless arrow words. Don't mean a thing. Tonight I think it's pretty obvious that there's no God. And there's definitely a God. I dreamt on the rocks at the asbury dune. That you jumped from the top of the log flume. And they gather like wolves on the boardwalk below. They're howling for answers, no, wolf can know. I charged at the waves with a glass in my hand. I was tossed like a ball at the bottle stand. And I landed besides your remains on the stone. Where your cold finger, wrapped round my ankle bones. Maybe ten feet away was a star. Thousands of times the size of our sun. Exploding like party balloons. ...?. Slept until our chest was full. Of yarn we, spun from Shetland wool. Socks from where the Dorset grows. Sheared and scoured hours. Before the rooster crows. The price of German silver fell. Threw this huge tailors down. The superstition well"
franklin,"And when we get home. I know we won't be home at all. This place we live, it is not where we belong. And I miss who we were. In the town that we could call our own. Going back to get away after everything has changed. 'Cause you remind me of a time when we were so alive. (Everything has changed). Do you remember that? Do you remember that?. (Everything has changed). 'Cause you help me push aside all that I have left behind. (Everything has changed). Do you remember that? Do you remember that?. So we stand here now and no one knows us at all. I won't get used to this. I won't get used to being gone. And going back won't feel the same if we aren't staying.

future,"I'm writing the future. I'm writing it out loud. We don't talk about the past. We don't talk about the past, now. So I'm writing the future. I'm leaving a key here. Something won't always be missing. It won't always feel empty, here. (Ohh). (Hmm). Just think of the future. And think of your dreams. You'll get away from here. You'll get away eventually. So just think of your future. Think of a new life. Don't get lost in the memories. Keep your eyes on a new prize. (Ahh)"
grow up,"I told 'em all where to stick it. Left town with a dime to my name. Said I'm done with all of my fake friends. Self-righteous pawns in a losing game. I got my band and a light that won't go out. Been burning since the day I was born. So I'll cry just little. Then I'll dry my eyes. 'Cause I'm not a little girl no more. Some of us have to grow up sometimes. And so if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind. Some of us have to grow up sometimes. And so if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind. Stood in line for so long just to picket. Something I will never understand. Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?. Won't you just admit you don't care?. And lady I don't want your pity. So don't feel sad for me. I've got a love I would die for. And a song to sing. Maybe we're both just living out our dream?. Some of us have to grow up sometimes. And so if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind. Some of us have to grow up sometimes. And so if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind. We get along for the most part. Me and reality, the light and the dark. And we live alone, two different worlds. Me in a fantasy, you in your memories. But we get along (we get along). For the most part (we get along). Now for the most part (we get along). For the most part (we get along). We get along. Some of us have to grow up sometimes. And so if I have to, I'm gonna leave you behind.

And are you racking your brain. just to find them all?. Could it be that I've changed or did you?. [Chorus]. Stop asking why. Why we had to waste so much time. Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again. 'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges. Time is a bastard. I won't break my neck to get around it. But aren't we so brave to give up a fight. And let the years go by without us. 'Cause now I feel you by my side. And I don't even care if it's been a while. I can feel that we've changed and we're better this way. [Chorus]. Stop asking why. Why we had to waste so much time. Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again. 'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges. And if you wanna call me up or come over. Come on, we'll laugh 'till we cry. Like we did when we were kids. 'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges. Why did it take so long?. Why did it take so long?. Why did it take us so long to just let it go?. Why did it take us so long to stop holding on?. [Chorus]. Stop asking why. Why we had to waste so much time.

just like me,I slipped down the stairs. Tripped over your fragile ego. I slipped down the hallway. Right into the web you'd woven. And you never said that you meant to save someone. Somebody just like me. And you never told me you wanted to love someone. Somebody just like me. You locked all the doors. You felt it was safer that way. You put up a wall.

part ii,"What a shame, what a shame we all remain. Such fragile broken things. A beauty half betrayed. Butterflies with punctured wings. Still there are darkened places. Deep in my heart. Where once was blazing light now. There's a tiny spark. Oh, glory, come and find me. Oh, glory, come and find me. Dancing all alone. To the sound of an enemy's song. I'll be lost until you find me. Fighting on my own. In a war that's already been won. I'll be lost until you come and find me here. Oh, glory, here. What a mess, what a mystery we've made. Of love and other simple things. Learning to forgive. Even when it wasn't a mistake. I question every human. Who won't look in my eyes. Scars left on my heart. Formed patterns in my mind. Oh glory, you will find me. Dancing all alone. To the sound of an enemy's song. I'll be lost until you find me. Fighting on my own. In a war that's already been won. I'll be lost until you come and find me here. Oh, glory. (I'll be lost until). Like the moon we borrow our light. I am nothing but a shadow in the night. So if you let me, I will catch fire. To let your glory and mercy shine"
playing god,"I can't make my own decisions. Or make any with precision. Well, maybe you should tie me up. So I don't go where you don't want me. You say that I've been changing. That I'm not just simply aging. Yeah, how could that be logical?. Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat. You don't have to believe me. But the way I, way I see it. Next time you point a finger. I might have to bend it back. Or break it, break it off. Next time you point a finger. I'll point you to the mirror. If God's the game that you're playing. Well, we must get more acquainted. Because it has to be so lonely. To be the only one who's holy. It's just my humble opinion. But it's one that I believe in. You don't deserve a point of view. If the only thing you see is you. You don't have to believe me. But the way I, way I see it. Next time you point a finger. I might have to bend it back. Or break it, break it off. Next time you point a finger. I'll point you to the mirror. This is the last second chance. (I'll point you to the mirror). I'm half as good as it gets. (I'll point you to the mirror). I'm on both sides of the fence.

Or break it, break it off. Next time you point a finger. I'll point you to the mirror. I know you won't believe me. But the way I, way I see it. Next time you point a finger. I might have to bend it back. Then break it, break it off. Next time you point a finger. I'll point you to the mirror"
pool,"As if the first cut. Wasn't deep enough. I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up. Could've gotten the same rush. From any lover's touch. Why get used to something new?. 'Cause no one breaks my heart like you. And you kiss me, and you wish. we could see what happens next. For a moment, I can forget. What happens in my head.

If you're really sorry. Happy second chance. I think I could forgive. If this time you won't leave me sinking. [Chorus]. I'm underwater. No air in my lungs. My eyes are open. And I'm giving up.

Stuck on you 'till the end of time. You've got me trapped again. I can't escape your incessant whine. When you beam it out all across the sky. No I can't escape (stuck on you 'till the end of time) your inside rhyme (i'm too tired to fight your rhyme). When you shoot it deep (stuck on you 'till the end of time). Straight into my mind

You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. I've got a tight grip on reality. But I can't. Let go of what's in front of me here.

You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. And I'm on my way to believing. Oh, And I'm on my way to believing"

throwing punches,There’s an empty room. At the end of the hall. And it’s begging to swallow you whole. Each step you take. Makes it easier to fall on your face. Each tear you fake. Makes it easier to see straight through you now. You’re so hateful sometimes. Throwing punches at lies. Far from somewhere above. Just to say you’re in Love. So you hang yourself from stolen dreams. And under the table you hide every step. Each step you take. (Getting closer). Makes it easier to fall on your face. Each death you fake. (Getting closer). Makes it easier to Love this way. Hey Now. And you’re so hateful sometimes. Throwing punches at lies. Far from somewhere above. Just to say you’re in Love. Watch it disapear. The dream you hold so dear. Let it Fade (Let it fade). Let it Fade (Let it fade). Let it Fade (Let it fade). Now. And you’re so hateful sometimes. Throwing punches at lies. Far from somewhere above. Just to say you’re in Love. Just to say you’re in Love

turn it off,"I scraped my knees while I was praying. And found a demon in my safest heaven. Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything. Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts.

Before it gets any better. We're headed for a cliff. And in the free fall I will realize. I'm better off when I hit the bottom. The tragedy it seems unending.
