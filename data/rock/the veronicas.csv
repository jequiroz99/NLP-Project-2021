the only high,"We were chasing the moment. We were feeling our power. We were hungry and broken. Throwing up in cold showers. And I loved every minute of it. Yeah every blurry moment of it. I thought we'd before we reach the sky. Yeah I loved every minute of it. When we're still in the middle of it. How did we ever get this far and still survive. Back when we were young and drunk. Love could never last forever. Then we sobered up. Swear my heartbeats all you better. You, you're the only high I need. You, you're the only high I need. Waking up on the hardwood. It's your taste I remember. It was right cause it felt good. Could've laid there forever. Back when we were young and drunk. Love could never last forever. Then we sobered up. Swear my heartbeats all you better. You, you're the only high I need. You, you're the only high I need. Only high only high. Only high only high. Life was so loud that we couldn't turn down. We were too proud til we figured it out. Only high only high. Only high only high. Back when we were young and drunk. Love could never last forever. Then we sobered up. Swear my heartbeats all you better. You, you're the only high I need. You, you're the only high I need"

thinking it over,"Just imagine that you have nothing done. Your life is so messed up and everything went wrong. Didn't know which way to go or what to do. And now I've lost my mind, we're out of time. I just gotta think it through. Now the time has come for me to start taking control of my life. I gave my way, I'll see it through, it's just what I wanna do. I'm thinking it over. Lost in my mind. The reasons are things that I cannot find. Someone even talk to me, walk with me, I could just pass right by me. This time, this time, cuz it's just how I feel. How would you feel if I told you. The truth of my life. Like my mum and I fight. While my dad drinks himself to sleep every night. I know you've heard it all before. And you've probably been through it yourself. Now the time has come for me to start taking control of my life. I gave my way, I'll see it through, it's just what I wanna do. I'm thinking it over. Lost in my mind. The reasons are things that I cannot find. Someone even talk to me, walk with me, I could just pass right by me. This time, this time, cuz it's just how I feel. Done all my thinking. I'm moving focus. And I've finally figured I'm worth at least something. Truth though it hurts, it's right. I can't give up the fight. Can't give up the fight. Now I need you [something] falling from the sky. Use my guardian eye; and it's there for you. I'm thinking it over. Lost in my mind. The reasons are things that I cannot find. Someone even talk to me, walk with me, I could just pass right by me. This time, this time, cuz it's just how I feel. I'm thinking it over. Lost in my mind. The reasons are things that I cannot find. Someone even talk to me, walk with me, I could just pass right by me.

this is how it feels,You keep calling my phone nonstop. Don’t you know I won’t pick it up. You never leave a message. Look how you’ve changed. You got nothing to say. Getting in my way. Show up at my house. You’re getting so obsessive. Like I have time for you. Wasn’t it me you didn’t want?. Wasn’t it me who was hanging on?. Now I’m done but before I go. I want you to know. Chorus: This is how it feels. When you wait for a call. And it never comes. Lying awake at night. Cuz you miss someone. This is how it feels. When the trust you had is broken. And you’re left to burn. With your heart wide open. You want to meet up to tell me why. Why & how. You had the heart to fuck up my whole life. That’s just so you. Now I’ve moved on. Found myself. And maybe I won’t forgive. I’ll just forget you lived. And I hope it hurts. Wasn’t it me you tried to blame?. Wasn’t it me you threw away?. But before you go. There’s something you should know. Chorus. You taught me how to hate you. And I was so in love. When I tried to save us. It was not enough. So what the hell is different. Cuz now that I am gone. You’re crawling back to tell me. I’m the one. This is how it feels. Chorus. Do you only want me?. Cuz you can’t have me. Do you only want me?. Cuz I’m gone. (Repeat 3X)
this love,"I can see it in your eyes. Taste it in our first kiss. Stranger in this lonely town. Save me from my emptiness. You took my hand. You told me it'd be ok. Trusting you to hold my heart. Now fate is pulling me away, from you. Even if I leave you now. And it breaks my heart. Even if I'm not around. I wont give in. I can't give up. On this love. You've become a piece of me. Makes me sick to even think. Of mornings waking up alone. Searching for you in my sheets. Don't fade away. Even if I leave you now. And it breaks my heart. Even if I'm not around. I wont give in. I can't give up. On this love. I can't just close the door. On this love. I've never felt anything like this before. Like this love. Tell me the truth. No matter what we're going through. Will you hold on too cause. Even if I leave you now. And it breaks my heart. Even if I'm not around. I wont give in. I can't give up. On this love. Even if I leave you now. And it breaks my heart. Even if I'm not around. I won't give in. I can't give up. I won't give in. I can't give up. On this love"
to know him,"Everyone knew him,. But they never really knew him at all.. Everyday I would sit next to him,. But we'll never talk.. Then I heard your name on the 6 o'clock news,. There was a million thoughts just running through my head.. How can something like these happen to you?. Now I wish you knew.... (Chorus). I give up forever just to see you again,. And I, I walk the world to understand. How we almost could have been. If only I have let you in.. I wanna to know him,. But I couldn't think in something to say.. So I let the moment pass me by. And now regrettitude stay.. Then I heard your name on the 6 o'clock news,. A rush of cold is running through my vains.. How can something like these happen to you?. Now I wish you knew.... (Chorus). I give up forever just to see you again,. And I, I walk the world to understand. How we almost could have been. If only I have let you in.. I wish I had the chance to say,. I wish I knew you,. I didn't think as you walked away. I'll never see you,. I won't forget, but it's too late.. And now I miss you!. Then I heard your name on the 6 o'clock news,. And in one day you suddenly have gone.. How can something like these happen to you?. Now I wish you knew.... (Chorus). I give up forever just to see you again,. And I, I walk the world to understand. How we almost could have been. (3x). If only I have let you in. (2x). - por Danilo Monticelli -"

we are one,Don't know what we're fighting for. Who'd have known we'd fall. A second's too late. Crashed down 1 foot below the ground. Did you hear the sound. Of a smile that is fading.

But we keep on falling. Into silence. Out of love. Out of time. what will it take. Till you realize?. 'Cause you know it's killing me. To be left unseen. Hey you. What's running through your head. It's cupid lying dead. While I'm sitting here waiting. And all the stupid little things. That belong to you and me. Will you really throw them all away?. CHORUS:. Cause i belong. I believe.

when it all falls apart,I'm having the day from hell. It was all going so well before you came. And told me you needed space. With a kiss on the side of my face... not again. And not to mention the tears I shed. When I should have kicked your ass instead. I need intervention. Attention to stop temptation to scream... baby. Chorus:. Everything is f'ed up. Straight from the heart. Tell me what do you do. When it all falls apart. Gotta pick myself up. Where do I start. ‘Cause I can't turn to you. When it all falls apart. Don't know where I parked my car. Don't know who my real friends are anymore. I put my faith in you. What a stupid thing to do... when it pours. And not to mention I drank to much. I'm feelin' hungover and out of touch. I need intervention. Attention to stop temptation to scream... baby. Repeat Chorus. Can't it be easier? Can't I just change my life?. ‘Cause it just seems to go bad everytime. Will I be mending?. Another one ending once again. Repeat Chorus

worlds apart,I'm gonna hold you for the last time. I'm gonna cry but afraid not to let it show. This is the hardest way to say goodbye. 'Cause as you walk away I'm feeling so alone.

your song,I’d never thought that I could feel this way. I’m lost for words around you today. I’m so confused cause everything changed. I know I said I hate when you get in a fight.

But this is now your song. To tell you how I feelin’. But Im down. Down here on my knees. Tellin’ you just kiss me now. And let it passes by. To let it passin’ by. You make it hard for me to pretend. Cause I see you more than just as a friend. And you should know Im your biggest fan. And if you hide and crash with me. I’ll do anything makes you. (Chorus). I Know that this is wrong. But this is how your song. To tell you how I feelin’. But Im down. Down here on my knees. Tellin’ you just kiss me now. And let it passes by. To let it passin’ by. Tell me im insane. Tell me you don’t feel the same. Cause I can see it in your eyes (in your eyes). And I know. (Chorus). I Know that this is wrong. But this is now your song. To tell you how I feelin’. But I am down. Down here on my knees. Tellin’ you just kiss me now. And let it passes by. To let it passin’ by. (x3)
