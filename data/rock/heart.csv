alone,"I hear the ticking of the clock. I'm lying here the room's pitch dark. I wonder where you are tonight. No answer on the telephone. And the night goes by so very slow. Oh I hope that it won't end though. Alone. Chorus:. Till now I always got by on my own. I never really cared until I met you. And now it chills me to the bone. How do I get you alone.

barracuda,"So, this ain't the end - I saw you again today. I had to turn my heart away. You smile like the sun - kisses for everyone. And tails - it never fails!. You lying so low in the weeds. I bet you gonna ambush me. You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees. Now, wouldn't you, Barracuda? Oh-oh-ohh. Back over time we were all trying for free. You met the porpoise in me, uh huh. No right no wrong, selling a song -. A name whisper game.. And if the real thing don't do the trick. You better make up something quick. You’re gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn into the wick. Ooh, Barracuda! Oh-oh-ohh…yeah. ""Sell me, sell you,"" the porpoise said. Dive down deep down save my head. You...I think that you got the blues, too.. All that night and all the next, swam without looking back. Made out for western pools - silly, silly fools!. The real thing don't do the trick, no. You better make up something quick. You’re gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn into the wick. Ohhh, Barra…barracuda! Yeah"
these dreams,Spare a little candle. Save some light for me. Figures up ahead. Moving in the trees. White skin in linen. Perfume on my wrist. And the full moon that hangs over. These dreams in the mist. Darkness on the edge. Shadows where I stand. I search for the time. On a watch with no hands. I want to see you clearly. Come closer than this. But all I remember. Are the dreams in the mist. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. Is it cloak n dagger. Could it be spring or fall. I walk without a cut. Through a stained glass wall. Weaker in my eyesight. The candle in my grip. And words that have no form. Are falling from my lips. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. There's something out there. I can't resist. I need to hide away from the pain. There's something out there. I can't resist. The sweetest song is silence. That I've ever heard. Funny how your feet. In dreams never touch the earth. In a wood full of princes. Freedom is a kiss. But the prince hides his face. From dreams in the mist. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away.

enough,The color blue I always felt it like a sigh But this is new This blue fire inside his eyes With feet of snow I try in vain He makes the northern lights come dance for me again (chorus) He’s good enough He’s sweet enough He’s man enough a little touch I need so much I want so much I need to feel that secret touch Why can’t I break out Why won’t he reach out for me Oh Loneliness It comes and it goes But lately loneliness loneliness It just grows and grows and grows Cause here he is living deep inside Nowhere nowhere nowhere to hide (chorus)
even it up,"""I'm the one who can please you"". Ain't that what you said. You seemed so alone. I guess I was easily led. I showed you my love. But I guess that it went to your head. When you were hungry. I brought you your breakfast in bed. Even it up, even it up, even it up. Even it up, even it up, even it up. A good man pays his debt. But you ain't paid yours yet. Even it. Even it up. I took you down over the tracks when. you wanted some sin. I brought you satin and herbs from. the places I been. Now something tells me you're. going to use me again. You think you can lay down the how and. the where and the when. Even it up, even it up, even it up. Even it up, even it up, even it up. I don't want to bum it all. But this axe she got to fall. Even it."
fallen from grace,I pray for the love. That's fallen from grace. The tears left behind. Won't wash from my face. I'm left with all these feelings. But nothing fills the space. Of the love that once was. That's fallen from grace. Every little picture. Hanging on the wall. Every little trace of you. I've found them all. I close my eyes. It's all I can do. Everywhere I look. I see some part of you. Been through every reason. And they all seem to fit. No one's pleaded guilty now. There's nothing to admit. There's no one to blame baby. Once you believe. 'Cos people only touch and go. But love will never leave. I pray for the love. That's fallen from grace. The tears left behind. Won't wash from my face. I'm left with all these feelings. But nothing fills the space. Of the love that once was. That's fallen from grace. I'm a little disappointed. I'm a little bit relieved. I feel a little sorry baby. I feel a bit deceived. No no not by you darlin'. I know love's demanding. Live and learning every day. But never understanding. Shattered dream and memories of you. Left hanging over me. A cross to bear. When love cools. A crown of thorns. For the queen of fools. I pray for the love. That's fallen from grace. The tears left behind. Won't wash from my face. I'm left with all these feelings. But nothing fills the space. Of the love that once was.
fallen ones,Born on the edge of a borderline In the simmering summer of sweet blue fire Now you walk on the cold cold wind Nothing left of your light The living sun just falls away leaving only day ~ day for night Again and again the comrades fall The tears roll down and the wounded crawl In this heartless crazy world the wounds just burn like fire Light a light for the fallen ones Light a light and hold it ~ hold it high Your burning star turned to midnight sun I will stay alive for the fallen ones Dancing with the smoke of your devastated flame Dancing with the smoke dancing with the rain So cold being here again So I call your name ~ I call ~ I call your name
fast times,"Fast times. Fast times. Bell, bell ringing me out of my sleep. Make the world on time. make a little money, little money to keep. When you see the light turn green. You better be the first off the line. You gotta move and move right now. Or you gonna get left behind. Fast times. Fast times. Same old school bee. I don't care too much about making those grades. Every day, every single day. I only come here just to see my babe. Night shift. Cash it out. Time clock punching me out of the door. Fire it up come on rev it, rev it up. Shoot my care into the freeway war. Fast times. Fast times. At the end of one day's race. I just got to see my darling's face. Before the day starts in again. Before the morning rings and rings. My baby's waiting anxiously. Pouring kisses over me. Always makes my nights so warm."

heavy heart,Heavy heart think of yesterday. And you're torn apart. Thinking of the ways it was easier to smile. More than today love grew wild. Heavy heart like a perfect stranger. You make it hard. Taking all the blame - still you hear the sound. Calling your name - troubles coming down. Too heavy. Turn it around. It's pressing me down. Heavy heart. This time I find. It weighs on my mind. Heavy heart. It's just like you to take it all so far. Then you feel abused and wonder who you are. Everything you've done - anything you start. Can turn and run. Ain't it true - it's only just a stage. Gotta give it room - start an empty page. Get back in the game - but do it your way. You don't have to play so heavy. Turn it around. It's pressing me down. Heavy heart. This time I find. It weighs on my mind. Heavy heart. When your heart is strong it leads you on. But when it breaks you. It devastates you for so long. Turn it around. It's pressing me down. Heavy heart. This time I find. It weighs on my mind. Heavy heart. Turn it around. It's pressing me down. Heavy heart. This time I find. It weighs on my mind.
hello moonglow,Hello moonglow. I need you here. Don?t disappear. Bring your halo. Don?t let me down. Come shine around. You know. sometimes it?s a long way through the day. I?m blown away. And if you know. when I land back on the ground. You?ll be around
here song,"Today summer day. Warm and green and grey. Wake up in the morning making love to me. Old man, lover child. How do you keep that smile. In the rain and in pain. All the same. All the same. Smiling through the rain. You know I got to stay here."
hey darlin' darlin',"Hey darlin darlin gonna say it true. No one understands me like you do. I got the story when I was a child. I took me over and turned me wild. Only to make it true. But when I'm alone all alone. No one home, the TV and the phone. Still say 'it will rain today"". O.K.. Hey darlin, darlin help me understand. What went wrong with the peaceful plan. Was it bold?. I ain't wishing for what used to be. I only hope that you and me can keep hold, unsold. When you go t no history, you're free. You sing and you believe so strong. You hold out fast and long, so long. Now the latest is the greatest is their plan. But they didn't make us and they can't break us. Darlin, darlin I don't think they can. Darlin, darlin I don't think they can. Hey darlin, darlin how's it gonna be?."

how can i refuse,Wake me up with laughter. Wrap me in your arms. This ain't no morning after. Never been so warm. It didn't take so long. For us to feel this way. Can a good thing last. Longer than a day?. Where do we take it now. Now that we caught fire?. Will something greater grow. Out of this desire?. Should I drop my guard. At the risk of being used?. But the way you do those things to me. How can I refuse?. I could get addicted. To your energy. The way you take me over. Pulling on me. Our hearts beat together. Our timing is the same. Can I trust my feelings. Save myself the pain?. Where do we take it now. Now that we caught fire?. Will something greater grow. Out of this desire?. Should I drop my guard. At the risk of being used?. But the way you do those things to me. How can I refuse?. We could share the mystery. Spare ourselves the misery. Discover it again every day. We could take love all the way. Where do we take it now. Now that we caught fire?. Will something greater grow. Out of this desire?. Should I drop my guard. At the risk of being used?. But the way you do those things to me. How can I refuse?.
how deep it goes,"In the quiet afternoon you left and went down into town. And I just watched the empty road behind you. Where the fog lies kissing the mountainside. You want to be sleeping, deep inside. Believing that the hungry world won't find you. Well, that's just fine, that's just fine. You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know. What I believe anymore. Or whether to leave, or whether to stay. Or what I can say. To make you know. How deep it goes. Somebody turned on the dirty blues. I know you don't like the blues. Cause the words are always the same. And they kind of remind you. Somebody turned the blues on me. I don't like the blues cause I can't see. Through the tears that come and make it hard to find you. Come on down. Come on down. You've got to come lay down here and say those things. Those warm things, right here in my ear. The times that you had that water like wine. So clean and so fine to make me know how deep it goes. Well, that's just fine, that's just fine. You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know. If I could leave anymore, even though there's a scar. Still fresh from the war, don't think about it no more. Letting new love flow."
i didn't want to need you,"Baby, I never gave my heart to anyone, oh no. Used to think that love was a game. I used to make it just for fun. When we spent the night together. Didn't mean it meant that much. Now I just can't live without your touch. I didn't wanna to need you, no. I didn't wanna want you like I do. I didn't mean to fall. Didn't wanna care at all.

My arms can't wait to hold you tight oh yeah. And when you're laying here beside me. There is nothing else I need. Never thought that this could ever be. I didn't wanna to need you, oh no. I didn't wanna want you like I do. I didn't mean to fall. Didn't wanna care at all. I didn't wanna need you. Like I need you now. I've always been free. To leave when I wanna leave. But it's not up to me anymore. I didn't wanna need you .... I didn't wanna to need you, no. I didn't wanna want you like I do. I didn't mean to fall. Didn't wanna care at all. I didn't wanna need you."
i give up,"I know you got a secret. that you really don?t want to show. You hid something somebody did to you. and you guard it like a lie. And I know what I?m talking about. Cause I?ve seen it leaking out. But I?m with you baby now,. and I?m not sneaking out. Cause I know. and I feel. you?re not showing me. How can I change what you won?t. let me see.

i jump,"Now has come the day. Love has found a way. As god we love our warren. We find our spirit soaring. Done, we make a vow. Stand together now. Gentle like we breathe. Sacred like we bleed. Now we're up upon a ledge. And it's too late to be tough. I feel the heat of love. And I jump. I jump. I jump. I know my heart is right. I jump. I jump. Straight into the light. Let the magic fly.

i love you,When the night has come. And I'm all alone. And I have some time to breathe. So much damage done. I guess nobody won. Is it too late to make you see. I love you. Oh darlin' yes I really do. I love you. Oh darlin' yes I really do. I know very well. How it got this way. I was drifting on my cloud. There isn't much to tell. Except you've gone away. Darlin' now I'm reaching out. I love you. Let me show you how I really do. I love you. Oh darlin' you gotta know it's true. I wish that I had you now. The way that I had you then. Darlin' I'd take you and hold you and kiss you. Over and over again. Maybe we can try. To get back to that place. When passion made us wild. No more alibis. Standing face to face. You will see it in my eyes. I love you. Oh my darlin' you know it's true. I love you. Let me tell you how much I really do. Oh darlin' you know I really do.
i need the rain,Long have I wandered. so far from home. Come to a place I. have never known. Gone too deep underground. Gone too far. better turn around. I?ve been running away. I?ve been. running away away. (chorus). Don?t you know. I need the rain to hide my tears. To cover me. wash me clear. Don?t you know. I need the rain. to hide my tears. I?m in my cloud. I?m not here. No killing sun. to know where I go. No no killing sun. to know where I go. Stop the world. make it wait. Don?t you burn my eyes. in the fires of day. Let me stay dark and safe. And this crazy rain is. my last escape. I?ve been running away. I?ve been. running away away (chorus)

I never thought this could happen to me. If I've fallen over you. Would it be so bad, would it be so bad. Every night's an eternity. I want you so bad, want you so bad. I never thought this could happen to me. I want you so bad, bad. When the wind blows through your hair. I want you so bad, want you so bad. Oh I wonder if you're aware. I want you so bad. I wonder if you care. I never thought this would happen to me. I want you so bad, bad. I want you so bad. I want you so bad. I want you so bad."

Touching me, touching me. I want your world to turn. Just for me. I want your fire to burn just for me. Like the moon affects the tide and the sea. I want your world to turn just for me. I won't share your love. No I want it all for my own. When you are in her arms. It really cuts me down to the bone. I felt your heart like a magnet. Your eyes were touching me. Touching me, touching me. I want your world to turn. Just for me yeah. I want your fire to burn just for me. Like the moon affects the tide and the sea. I want you world to turn just for me.

I've got the music in me. I've got the music in me. I've got the music in me. You say that life is a circle. But that ain't the way that I found it. Oh...Gonna move in a straight line.

I've got the music in me. I've got the music in me. I've got the music in me. I've got the music in me.
if looks could kill,"Caught you in the act. Can't put up with that. Messing where you shouldn't be. I wanna hear you say you're sorry. 'Cause nobody takes advantage of me. You're missing the mark. Shooting in the dark. I'm pulling the wool from my eyes. Baby don't you push me further. It's gonna hurt if it happens twice. If looks could kill. You'd be lying on the floor. You'd be begging me please, please. Baby don't hurt me no more. If looks could kill. You'd be reeling from the pain. And you'd never lie again. If looks could kill. You're living on the edge. Hanging by a thread. I'm watching every move you make. You don't want to see me anger. So don't you make another mistake. Love is on the line. I ain't about to be kind. That's a promise and a thread. If I was you, I'd really cool it. Or risk a night you'll never forget. If looks could kill. You'd be lying on the floor. You'd be begging me please, please. Darling don't hurt me no more. If looks could kill. You'd be reeling from the pain. And you'd never lie again. If looks could kill. I was a fool to believe in you. A sucker for every line. I'm a little less blind. Than I was before. I can see right through your design. If looks could kill. You'd be lying on the floor. You'd be begging me please, please. Baby don't hurt me no more. If looks could kill.

in walks the night,In Walks the Night by Heart. The night is falling like an angel on your. memory. And we are well acquainted. We are sworn enemies. And the lonely beating of my heart tonight. is only one more thing I gotta fight. Well I think about you baby. Days of heaven that we had. Then I get to thinkingmaybe. -Maybe too much thinking's bad. Well my mind takes no prisoners. -pities no one. Spares not even me 'til the harm is done. Here I go again. The night just walked in. In walks the night. In walks my fantasy. Darkness all around me. And I'm dying for the light. Reach down for a little strength deep. inside. Well I know I love my freedom. But lonely feelings come and go. And night time is a season. Feel the cold wind blow. And I toss and I turn and I walk the floor. I don't wanna cry - don't wanna cry no more. Here I go again. The night just walked in. In walks the night. In walks my fantasy. Darkness all around me. And I'm dying for the light. Reach down for a little strength deep. inside. I reach down for my sanity. If only these eyes could see through all. the emptiness I found. around me. In walks the night. I can almost feel you in the darkness all. around. Still I'm waiting for the break of day. Waiting for a miracle. A dream that won't wander away. Well my mind takes no prisoners. -pities no one. It spares not even me 'til the harm is done. Here I go again. The night just walked in. In walks the night. In walks my fantasy. Darkness all around me. And I'm dying for the light. Reach down for a little strength deep. inside. I reach down for my sanity. If only these eyes could see through all. the emptiness I found. around me. In walks the night. The night just walked in. In walks the night. The night just walked in. Maybe I'll be all right. In walks the night.
johnny moon,"Johnny Moon. Dreams in class. Answers the question before it's asked. You can see Johnny but he's not here. Nobody saw Johnny disappear. Mother says his mama's too easy. Letting him come and go as he pleases. Walls and windows won't do it. Lock the door. Johnny goes right through it. It's so hard to get his attention. When he's out there in another dimension. Johnny I wanna follow you outside. I wanna feel that high. It's so hard to get his attention. When he's out there in another dimension. Johnny, I wanna follow you outside. I wanna feel that high. Johnny, you, I can pretend with. You're only one I can really bend with. Take me 'cross the river Styx. Fill my eyes with fire tricks. Anything you got up your sleeve. Anything you tell me, Johnny, I'll believe. It's so hard to get your attention. When you're out there in another dimension. Johnny, I wanna follow you outside."
just the wine,"Once in a life. We lived in a sanctuary. A song could get us free. Slept behind the altar. Only the singer saw. Now it is gone, years on. Times we took alone. Stealing an hour, buying a night. It's hard on the telephone. Love outside the law. Jai tant reve du toi. Is it gone, this year. Is the song still in your ear. Were we only high. Just the wine. Only the times. When we're old. How will the story be told. Windswept smoke used by time. Waiting for the bus. Will that be us?. Do you recall my friend. We never thought we'd ever fall. When the salesman came to call. Selling our soul to buy. Sometimes it ain't no deal at all."
kick it out,Out of the street- get on home. tail shaking filly running on her own. they say she got loose on the night she was born. cranking it up in a school zone. 'kick it out- kick it out!' she said. 'kick out your motor and drive. while you're still alive- kick it out!'. sitting in a bar in a seaside town. sweet little love getting high getting down. sailors see her running along the beach. laugh and jump out of reach. wild music blowing in her mane. she needs a bareback rider won't give her no pain. a hard racy game of give and take. leaves them dazed- half crazed- in her wake. 'kick it out- kick it out!' she said. 'kick out your motor and drive. while you're still alive- kick it out!'.
language of love,"I been trying a long long time. To write a love letter, perfect lines. What I want to say is hard to find. No cliches or tired rhymes. But words turn on me. Hard as I try. It's your look of love. I can't describe. I'll use the language of love. You'll understand what I say. Words are never enough. The language of love is the only way. Bad bad heartaches. When I'm alone. Fighting with feelings. I've never known. Scared and lonely. Half gone mad. 'Cos I need what I just can't have. I write a love letter like a kiss in the night. I wanna tell it to you, just right. I'll use the language of love. You'll understand what I say. Words are never enough. The language of love is the only way. I need love so very bad. You're the best I ever had. I need to say I need to show. In the way only lovers know. I'll use the language of love. You'll understand what I say. Words are never enough. The language of love is the only way. I'll use the language of love. You'll understand what I say. Words are never enough."
led to one,You and me always be I down need ~ deep I bleed for love Wise ones say seize the day Waste not time make your mind for love We’ll ride that rollercoaster up and down No promise that we’ll never crash to the ground Same old day same old race Just in case find a place for love All to taste little grace of love When days are gray we go downtown We’ll walk around and talk and talk it out Under the cover of the old marquee see colors on the twilight street We find a shelter in each other now the rain is like a symphony I down need ~ deep I bleed for love I down need ~ deep I bleed for love I down need ~ I bleed
lighter touch,"Look at me, the answer is so clear. Lying close by the fire place. I wish that you could see yourself this way. My love, with the firelight upon your face.. Ain't it strange how love put things together?. One like you, someone like me.. But no one ever moved me like the way you do. And held against you, love I am weak, oh yeah. Before us now, the dream of love is playin'. A butterfly risin' from the flame. You and me don't need no chain. Since this feeling came to us. A touch of love, a lighter touch. This touch of love, this lighter touch,. Than hands of love through time. Reaching up to have and to hold you. But you know I'll always stay If I. Am free to go. You know I'll take. Your love into my soul. Be lighter. Touch of love this lighter, lighter. Lighter touch."
little queen,"You'd rather have wine than gin. Only the finest by your skin. Always running after Time - catching. You're fancy with rhyme. Shining on the front page again. Hot on the presses today - little queen. Making your passion play - little queen. Nobody knows your melancholy mind -. Little queen. Away from the sellers, the papers said. Your crown was tight and heavy on your head. Still you danced and you sang - all night. The telephone rang. Music kept on playing from your pen.. Hot on the presses today - little queen. Making your passion play - little queen. Nobody knows your melancholy mind -. Little queen. Raining Raining- he knows your Soul ain't free. Raining Raining- he feels you little queen. Slipping away with your gypsy band. Hot on your music and playing a winning hand. He was standing in the line, thinking how you. Moved his mind."
lost angel,As it was before shall it ever ever be. Hear it on the crying wind. Hear it weeping on the sea. Through the winter valley wild and through the darkest night. Here comes the evil news of the coming fight. So love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace. All through the storm let the tides release. Love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace. All through the storm let the tides release. Come on down Lost Angel find us now. From the clouds above right down to the ground. Lost Angel come on down. Stardust yeah yeah we are and the willow is pushed to bend. Too much too much of man. And stardust we will be again. Oh love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace. All through the storm let the tides release. Love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace. All through the storm let the tides release
love alive,"the sky was dark this morning. when i raised my head. i stood at the window- darkness was my bane. suddenly a sunbeam arch. thrilled me to my weary heart. it was the prettiest thing i'd ever seen. i knew i had to keep my love. keep my love alive. keep my love- keep my love alive. baby i want you to roll me. hold me in your love. no more habits, promises and jive. ever since i was a baby girl. wanted one thing most in this world. it was to keep my love- keep my love alive. i want to keep my love- keep my love alive. keep my love- keep my love alive. you're up there under the spotlight. your silver trophy shines. with all you got, my lord! you must get high. you need a whole lot more than money. you need more than to survive. you gotta keep your love. keep your love alive!."
love mistake,"K.C.. Take another sip-o-wine. You gotta get her off your mind. You can talk about your heartbreak to me. Ok, K.C. I wish it could be easy. Just another lesson of the heart. K.C.. We were feelin' out of place. So we made our own escape. In that New York cafe place to be. Outsider, traveler you and me. We were laughing about it. Kept us out of reach. I won't forget that night. I won't forget that light. Through the window and the lace. Making patterns on your face. Exposed with all your pain. I know it hurts the worst. That very first love mistake. You said we'll still be sitting. Here again someday,. Laughing at ourselves this way. After time has healed and made it right. We'll still be looking in each other's eyes. And through it all. It's friends who will survive. I won't forget that night. I won't forget that light. Through the window and the lace. Making patterns on your face. Exposed with pain. I know it hurts the worst. That very first love mistake. I won't forget that night. I won't forge that light. Through the window and the lace. Making patterns on your face. Exposed with all your pain. I know it hurts the worst."
love song,The words I have to say. May well be simple but they?re true. Until you give your love. There?s nothing more that we can do. Love is the opening door. Love is what we came here for. No one could offer you more. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?. You say it?s very hard. To leave behind the life we knew. But there?s no other way. And now it?s really up to you. Love is the key we must turn. Truth is the flame we must burn. Freedom the lesson we must learn. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?. Love is the opening door. Love is what we came here for. No one could offer you more. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?. Do you know what I mean?. Have your eyes really seen?
magazine,"Up in the little room, looking down, everybody's passing time. Princess dressed in wool, dreaming eyes, whispering her rhymes. ""Rain play my song today, no one wants to know me anyway"". Perfect lover where are you?. I can't wait much more for you to come true. Shining prince inside my head,. Live inside a palace underneath my bed. And everybody knows who they are in a velvet garden of rhinestone stars. Shine down on me satin queen, overlords of insane scenes. They go dancing cross the pages of the magazine. Typewriter steel and gray, work away, everybody's going home. Over across town, caught in a crowd, still living alone. Little room for her out of the rain. A little something for the pain. Lady-in-waiting potentially for the lord of the rock 'n roll aristocracy. Dreaming in photographs at night, love's like sand held in your hand so tight. And everybody know who they are in a velvet garden of rhinestone stars. Shine down on me satin queen, overlords of insane scenes. They go dancing cross the pages of the magazine. Everyday's like the day before. Come in tired and lock the door. Paint your space with magic hands. Shining slick and dandy. Shining slick and dandy. Smile at your fans. ""C'mon pretty boy sing for us take me"". Take me over the edge. I know you're good enough. And everybody knows who they are in a velvet garden of rhinestone stars. Shine down on me satin queen, overlords of insane scenes."
magic man,"Cold late night so long ago. When I was not so strong you know. A pretty man came to me. Never seen eyes so blue. I could not run away. It seemed we'd seen each other in a dream. It seemed like he knew me. He looked right through me. ""Come on home, girl"" he said with a smile. ""You don't have to love me yet. Let's get high awhile. But try to understand. Try to understand. Try try try to understand. I'm a magic man."". Winter nights we sang in tune. Played inside the months of moon. Never think of never. Let this spell last forever. Summer over passed to fall. Tried to realized it all. Mama says she's a worried. Growing up in a hurry. ""Come on home, girl"" mama cried on the phone. ""Too soon to lose my baby yet my girl should be at home!"". ""But try to understand, try to understand. Try try try to understand. He's a magic man, mama. He's a magic man"". ""Come on home, girl"" he said with a smile. ""I cast my spell of love on you a woman from a child!. But try to understand, try to understand. I'm a magic man!""."
make me,Tell me why after all this time is the light hiding in your eyes. Do I see the promises never made or is it a sweet surprise?. Make me High. Make low. Make it stop or come on let the damn thing go. I am hanging on your heart. Make me love or fall apart. Come on make me. Talk to me now tell me true. Tell me what you wanna do. Are we gonna go on one by one or do we go two by two. Make me High. Make low. Make it stop or come on let the damn thing go. I am hanging on your heart. Make me love or fall apart. Come on make me. I need a place to lay my head. Take you wine onto my tongue. Pick me up and shake me shake me down. I need your heart to hear my song. Hold me down-see me. Let me go- open up your handand set me free. Like a dandelion - like a hitcher on the wind. Set me free again. Set me free again. Make me High. Make low. Make it stop or come on let the damn thing go. I am hanging on your heart. Make me love or fall apart. Come on make me. Make me fly - make me fall. Make me everything or make me nothing at all. I am hanging on your heart. Make me love or fall apart. Come on make me
mistral wind,"No wind when I took the watch. My ship was still and waitin'. I lay on that mirrored sky. A restless sail or waitin'. I closed my eyes said the. Words of will for the gentle. Breathin' that moves the seas. Make my sails fill. Whisper waves cloud the glass. Awake at last like a lover. It rushed around the talkin' sweet. Roll over, roll over, roll over. And in my ear he blew his name. It sound so strange but I heard it plain. Mistral Mistral wind. I have always held the wheel but. I let the wind steal my power. Spin me 'round lose my course. Nights run be like hours. Well, it would show me the way. To the deepest mountains. Too high and beautiful to be. Mistral, mistral wind. All the hours on the watch. I wait for that breeze to move me. And blow me back to that place. Magic space all through me. And I sigh your name. Across the empty water. You made a crazy dreamer out of me. Mistral, mistral, mistral, mistral,."

sleep alone,"Say so long baby. Turn around. Loneliness hits you. Emptiness closes you down. Alone in his car. You think of his name. Took part of you with him. It won't be the same. You love to relive. The love that he gives. You love to recall. The rush of it all. He woos you so sweet. Then kicks on the heat. You're willing, you're hot. Give him all that you got. Lonely woman gets so cold. With no loverboy to hold. One more night she's on her own. Nobody meant to sleep alone. You're waiting too hard, counting the days. Till he comes home to lift you out of this haze. You dream all day, climb the walls all night. No satisfaction till he makes it right. So hard to kick. The memory addicting you. So hard to lick. The romance afflicting you. You love to relive the love that he gives. You love to recall the rush of it all. Lonely woman gets so cold. With no loverboy to hold. One more night she's on her own."
soul of the sea,"Today you looked around to my heart's call. This tiny life ain't been strangled after all. Time, time, time, time. Never ask what's become of us. Just dedicate your sorrow. Here and now. To the soul of the sea. And me. Rushin' to me. You turned around to my song's call. You dreamer in the sand. Just lie there laughing til the fall. Kindest lover. I can't stay alone tonight. Bring me all your love. Here and now. Come rushin' to me. Wake up late. Without a smile. Telephone rings. You run like a child. On the street. Into the day. The people I meet. Have nothing to say. No smile. No sorrow. No laughter. No tomorrow. They talk hen to hen. They talk about their men. And practice all the tricks for them. Too soon nightime's coming on. Deep in the darkness feeling alone. No rain. No seed. No dreams. No silence. Far away today. Mama ocean hold me to you. Rock me on your waves. And tell me.... Is it all true?. Time, time, time, time. Never ask what's become of us. Dedicate your sorrow. Here and now."

strange night,Get out that wig - I know you. Put on those shiny pointed shoes. We'll have a strange night. Corsage - long gown - all the rest. That ain't what we call dressed. For a strange night. You're gonna lose who you are. We could take it pretty far. Can there ever be any harm. No one will know you. You won't show. Feels wild like we used to. Just tonight that the feeling's right. We'll wear a disguise that won't. show through. We'll go out in the old red car. You can sit in the bakc seat and play. your guitar. If the blue lights flash while we're rockin. Don't you worry I'll do the talking. And tell it right. You're gonna lose who you are. We could take it pretty far. Can there ever be any harm. No one will know you. You won't show. Feels wild like we used to. Just tonight that the feeling's right. We'll wear a disguise that won't. show through. Let's just stop at random places. Just to see the look on their faces. What a strange sight. Put on that wig - I know you. I know what you like to do.
strangers of the heart,Through the mist on the harbor. Dancing lights on the water. Shadows move I see you smiling again. When I reach out to touch you. Like a ghost looking through me. Sending chills deep into me. Shattered dreams falling like. teardrops again. As you make me remember. Strangers of the heart. Always safe with words unspoken. Strangers of the heart. Don't take chances they'll get broken. No matter where you are. Hear me tonight I don't want to be. strangers at heart. Broken glass of my mirror. Makes my eyes see much clearer. You and I only a whisper away. Never telling each other. Strangers of the heart. Always safe with words unspoken. Strangers of the heart. Don't take chances they'll get broken. No matter where you are. Hear me tonight I don't want to be. strangers at heart. Strangers of the heart. Always safe with words unspoken. Strangers of the heart. Don't take chances they'll get broken. No matter where you are. Hear me tonight I don't want to be.

the situation,"Go to the city away from the land, stand in a line. Where they stamp your hand, wind up at a dance. You want to energize, is it just by chance. People have electric eyes. Wires and strings, line that lead to power supplies. Games read green on table screens, charged and powered. Mediaized, we are channeled, we are hypnotized. Wake up, shake up the situation. Hold on, help the situation. Human condition, so extreme, you can see it feeding the new. machine. There is still a dream, our humanity, hero rebels die. Leaving us the key. Wake up, shake up the situation."

these dreams,Spare a little candle. Save some light for me. Figures up ahead. Moving in the trees. White skin in linen. Perfume on my wrist. And the full moon that hangs over. These dreams in the mist. Darkness on the edge. Shadows where I stand. I search for the time. On a watch with no hands. I want to see you clearly. Come closer than this. But all I remember. Are the dreams in the mist. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. Is it cloak n dagger. Could it be spring or fall. I walk without a cut. Through a stained glass wall. Weaker in my eyesight. The candle in my grip. And words that have no form. Are falling from my lips. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. There's something out there. I can't resist. I need to hide away from the pain. There's something out there. I can't resist. The sweetest song is silence. That I've ever heard. Funny how your feet. In dreams never touch the earth. In a wood full of princes. Freedom is a kiss. But the prince hides his face. From dreams in the mist. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away.

Just because the world is wide. Out under the sky. Hey hey hey yeah yeah - out under the sky. Hey hey hey yeah yeah - out under the sky. Out under the sky. When all is said and done. Darlin' we are the only ones. There's only you and I. Out under the sky. Out under the sky."

voodoo doll,"You haunt my room in the dead of night. I see your face in the firelight. Your hungry kiss I canâ€™t forget- but I wonâ€™t give it to you yet. You got moves that make a good girl sweat. You wonâ€™t catch me in your net. You work your magic on my blues,. but Iâ€™m no slave for you to use. I wonâ€™t beg and I wonâ€™t crawl. I wonâ€™t be your voodoo doll. Baby I wonâ€™t be your voodoo doll. Stirring up a potion of colors make me crazy. You got something I canâ€™t leave alone.. Shaking me, making me tremble,. youâ€™re calling me baby. Heaven help me turn my heart to stone.. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,. Hey moon man, donâ€™t shine on me.. You are dangerous company.. I got treasure in my chest and the price is high for all the rest. Ainâ€™t no snake inside my wall.. I wonâ€™t be your voodoo doll."
wait for an answer,"Someone told me to call. So I did and no one answered. And I don't hear a sound. But I know someone's laughing. I'm trying hard to keep my confidence.

What you go though, but I do. The phone keeps ringing. No one know what you're thinking. But I do, I do, I do. They were laughing at you. And I held out my hand. I was trying to get through. Without losing again. Where are you, how are you. I wait for an answer. wait for an answer. It's been so long. I'll hold on. and wait for an answer. wait for an answer. What's that you say I can't hear you. Are those words meant for me,. as they appear to be. The tension in my voice awakes you. You know who I am but my name escapes you. They were looking for you.

what about love?,I've been lonely. I've been waiting for you. I'm pretending. And that's all I can do. The love I'm sending. Ain't making it. Through to your heart. You've been hiding. Never letting it show. Always trying. To keep it under control. You got it down and you're well. On the way to the top. But there's something that you forgot. What about love?. Don't you want someone. To care about you?. What about love?. Don't let it slip away. What about love?. I only want to share it with you. You might need it someday. I can't tell you. What you're feeling inside. I can't sell you. What you don't want to buy. Something's missing. And you got to look back on your life. You know something. Here just ain't right. What about love?. Don't you want someone. To care about you?. What about love?. Don't let it slip away. What about love?. I only want to share it with you. You might need it someday

What he don't know. Will never hurt him. What he don't know. Is I have changed. It's just a matter of time. Till it all comes down, down, down. Till he hears. The stories going round, round, round.

CHORUS:"
wheels,"Night inside the city. Empty sidewalks. Stretching under dizzy lights. Rain is hummin'. The streets are runnin'. Underneath the neon lights. We run together. We'll run forever. Outta here ridin' the wheels. Look at pretty windows. At shiny people. Statues under sparkling lights. Just take a picture. And a melted moment. Flashin' on the crazy ride. Just close your eyes now. And breathe a sigh now. We're gettin' outta here. Outta here. Ridin' the wheels. (Ridin' the wheels). Ooo-uh. Ridin' the wheels. (Ridin' the wheels). Ridin' the wheels. (Wheels). Outta here, ridin' the wheels. (Ridin' the wheels). Ridin' the wheels. Ridin' the wheels. (Ridin' the wheels). Ridin', ridin' the wheels. (Ridin' the wheels). Ridin', ridin', ridin' the wheels.

white lightning & wine,"This night's gone, we're moving on. Highway's calling aloud. I bring them in with eyes of sin. It's a down drinkin' freaky crowd. Chew you up and I spit you out. Never want to know your name. Don't want to know you but I sure want to show you. Never will forget I came. On the world's all mine. White lightning and wine came on so fast. When did I last feel this fine?. White lightning and wine. Sweet little one let me love you some. Take me or leave me alone. The gooder they come, the harder they fall. Turn around you are a nasty joke. Yeah, we all laugh oh, hah, what a gas!. Watching you chew on the bones. In the morning light you didn't look so nice. Guess you'd better hitch hike home. On the world's all mine. White lightning and wine came on so fast. When did I last feel this fine?. White lightning and wine"

will you be there (in the morning),"I'm lying beside you just thinking about us. Too tired to go to sleep and too much in love. I know I'm crazy but I can't close my eyes. I'm scared you won't be there in the morning when I rise. Will you be there?. Who do you dream about are you alone in your sleep. To who will you reach out?. Oh, let it be me.

Will you be there when I wake up,. Oh I need you to be there in the morning. Will you be there?. Well, you're so close to me but I feel so alone. The more I touch you the more I want.

Will you be there in the morning,. will you be there when I want you?. Will you be there when I wake up?. I need you to be there in the morning!. I wanna love you forever,.

The hardest thing you'll ever learn. Is what bridge to cross and what bridge to burn. (What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn). How much talking does it take. Talking 'bout your bad mistakes. Gonna to talk you wide awake. Talk until your ego breaks. What's the matter with you?. What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn. What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn.

you ain't so tough,What in the world did I do. to deserve you. I don't understand why you. treat me that way. You knew you were everything. I ever wanted. You had your own ways of making me pay. Then you took it just a little too far. Now I see you for what you are. I don't need the heartache anymore. Loving you was an endless fight. I was wrong and you were always right. But look what happened when I called. your bluff. When the truth comes out. you ain't so tough. You turned me into an emotional prisoner. You hit me with words that cut to the bone. Then you kissed me and made me believe that. I needed you. And think I could never survive on my own. Never thought that I would break away. Now I see right through your power play. And I don't feel so helpless after all. Loving you was an endless fight. I was wrong and you were always right. But look what happened when I called. your bluff. When the truth comes out. you ain't so tough. You took me too far to forgive it. That was your last mistake. That was your last mistake. Loving you was an endless fight. I was wrong and you were always right. But look what happened when I called. your bluff. When the truth comes out. you ain't so tough. You take it all but you don't give back. You feel strong when the odds are stacked. But there comes a time when enough's enough. When the truth comes out you ain't so tough.
