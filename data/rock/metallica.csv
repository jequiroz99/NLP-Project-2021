Gripping your pillow tight. Exit light. Enter night. Take my hand. We're off to never neverland. Something's wrong, shut the light. Heavy thoughts tonight. And they aren't of Snow White.

one,"I can't remember anything. Can't tell if this is true or dream. Deep down inside I feel to scream. This terrible silence stops me. Now that the war is through with me. I'm waking up, I can now see. That there's not much left of me. Nothing is real but pain now. Hold my breath as I wish for death. Oh please God, wake me. Back in the womb it's much too real. In pumps life that I must feel. But can't look forward to reveal. Look to the time when I'll live. Fed through the tube that sticks in me. Just like a wartime novelty. Tied to machines that make me breathe. Cut this life off from me. Hold my breath as I wish for death. Oh please God, wake me. Now the world is gone I'm just one. Oh God help me. Hold my breath as I wish for death. Oh please God, help me. Darkness. Imprisoning me. All that I see. Absolute horror. I cannot live. I cannot die. Trapped in myself. Body my holding cell. Landmine.

fade to black,"Life, it seems, will fade away. Drifting further every day. Getting lost within myself. Nothing matters, no one else. I have lost the will to live. Simply nothing more to give. There is nothing more for me. Need the end to set me free. Things not what they used to be. Missing one inside of me. Deathly lost, this can't be real. Cannot stand this hell I feel. Emptiness is filling me. To the point of agony. Growing darkness taking dawn. I was me, but now he's gone. No one but me can save myself. But it's too late. Now I can't think. Think why I should even try. Yesterday seems as though it never existed. Death greets me warm. Now I will just say goodbye"

brandenburg gate (with lou reed),I would cut my legs and tits off. When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski. In the dark of the moon. It made me dream of Nosferatu. Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau. Oh wouldn’t it be lovely. I was thinking Peter Lorre. When things got pretty gory as I. Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate. I was feeling snappy perhaps I’d been napping. And I’d just ate. A following heart can tear you apart. On a midnight to 8 shift. A graveyard romance can only give one chance. As the tombstones weave and breathe. Feeling happy when my heart got beating. On a Sunday afternoon. I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses. And stars were still illumed. I have three hearts that I keep apart. Trying to relate. To normal feelings and the nightime reelings. And some absynthe drunk so late. The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk. Onto the size of dessert plates. But me I’m happy cause I got my little nappy. And some opium to set me straight. I’m just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl. While my looks still hold me straight. Straight up to illusion and fantasy’s fusion. Of reality mixed with drink. I’m just a small town girl who’s gonna give life a whirl. Looking at the Brandenburg Gate

brothers in arms,Those mist covered mountains. Are a home now for me. But my home is the lowlands. And always will be. Some day you'll return to. Your valleys and your farms. And you'll no longer burn. To be brothers in arms. Through these fields of destruction. Baptism of fire. I've whittnessed your suffering. As the battles raged higher. And though they did hurt me so bad. In the fear and alarm. You did not desert me. My brothers in arms. There's so many different worlds. So many different suns. And we have just one world. But we live in different ones. Now the sun's gone to hell. And the moon's riding high. Let me bid you farewell. Every man has to die. But it's written in the starlight. And every line on your palm. We're fools to make war. On our brothers in arms

fixxxer,"Yeah. Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins. One for each of us and our sins. So you lay us in a line. Push your pins, they make us humble. Only you can tell in time. If we fall or merely stumble. But tell me. Can you heal what father's done. Or fix this hole in a mother's son. Can you heal the broken worlds within. Can you strip away so we may start again. Tell me, can you heal what father's done. Or cut this rope and let us run. Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free. You jab another pin. Jab another pin in me. Yeah. Mirror, mirror upon the wall. Break the spell or become the doll. See you sharpening the pins. So the holes will remind us. We're just the toys in the hands of another. And in time the needles turn from shine to rust. But tell me. Can you heal what father's done. Or fix this hole in a mother's son. Can you heal the broken worlds within. Can you strip away so we may start again. Tell me, can you heal what father's done. Or cut this rope and let us run. Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free. You jab another pin. Jab another pin in me. Jab it. Blood for face. Sweat for dirt. Three X's for the stone. To break this curse. A ritual's due. I believe I'm not alone. Shell of shotgun. Pint of gin. Numb us up to shield the pins. Renew our faith. Which way we can. To fall in love with life again. To fall in love with life again. To fall in love with life again. To fall in love. To fall in love. To fall in love with life again. So tell me. Can you heal what father's done. Or fix this hole in a mother's son. Can you heal the broken worlds within. Can you strip away so we may start again. Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done. Or cut this rope and let us run. Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free. You jab another pin. Jab another pin in me. Oh yeah. No more pins in me, yeah. No more, no more pins in me.

for whom the bell tolls,"Make his fight on the hill in the early day. Constant chill deep inside. Shouting gun,. On they run through the endless gray. On they fight, for they are right,. Yes, but who's to say?. For a hill, men would kill.. Why? they do not know. Stiffened wounds test their pride. Men of five, still alive. Through the raging glow. Gone insane from the pain. That they surely know. For whom the bell tolls. Time marches on. For whom the bell tolls. Take a look to the sky. Just before you die. It's the last time he will. Blackened roar, massive roar,. Fills the crumbling sky. Shattered goal fills his soul. With a ruthless cry. Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery. He hears the silence so loud. Crack of dawn, all is gone. Except the will to be. Now they see what will be,. Blinded eyes to see. For whom the bell tolls. Time marches on. For whom the bell tolls"
four horsemen,By the last breath of the fourth winds blow. Better raise your ears. The sound of hooves knocks at your door. Lock up your wife and children now. It's time to wield the blade. For now you have got some company. The Horsemen are drawing nearer. On the leather steeds they ride. They have come to take your life. On through the dead of night. With the four Horsemen ride. or choose your fate and die. You have been dying since the day you were born. You know it has all been planned. The quartet of deliverance rides. A sinner once a sinner twice. No need for confession now. Cause now you have got the fight of your life. The Horsemen are drawing nearer. On the leather steeds they ride. They have come to take your life. On through the dead of night. With the four Horsemen ride. or choose your fate and die. Time. Has taken its toll on you. The lines that crack your face. Famine. Your body it has torn through. Withered in every place. Pestilence. For what you have had to endure. And what you have put others through. Death. Deliverance for you for sure. There is nothing you can do. So gather round young warriors now. and saddle up your steeds. Killing scores with demon swords. Now is the death of doers of wrong. Swing the judgment hammer down. Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat. The Horsemen are drawing nearer. On the leather steeds they ride. They have come to take your life. On through the dead of night. With the four Horsemen ride. or choose your fate and die

Forever sorry I shall be. And from a darkness I descend. Clenching a torch of sweet revenge. You took away tomorrow, still I stand. I ride into the sorrow, still I stand. You took away tomorrow, still I stand. Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand. Wrath is the name. Branding suffer onto you. And wrath takes the shame. And holds me down until its through. And from a darkness I descend. Clenching a torch of sweet revenge. You took away tomorrow, still I stand. I ride into the sorrow, still I stand. You took away tomorrow, still I stand. I sink into the sorrow, but still I stand. And hate is a train. They'd hung for those fleshes carved. And hate takes the blame. A beast that never slows at all. And from a darkness I descend. Clenching a torch of sweet revenge. Burst into flame, the bitter end. And shake these gates of hell again. Cursed to drown in sorrow.... You took away tomorrow, still I stand. I ride into the sorrow, still I stand. You took away tomorrow, still I stand. You left me here with sorrow, still I stand"

iced honey (with lou reed),"You can’t put a butterfly in a jar. If the effort’s too high no matter who you are. You can’t catch the moon, or the sun or the stars. It doesn’t matter who you are. Iced honey. Now me I’ve tried a million tricks. To make life cold and make it stick. Not running heat that flames then out. But the proud piece of ice that always floats. Iced honey. If I can’t trap a butterfly or a bee. If I can’t keep my heart where I want it to be. If no matter how much soul and heart. I put to the wood. If a flaming heart is not that good. Iced honey. If you can’t put a butterfly in a jar. If violence mars your final hour. If you make others feel like jam. Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb. If it’s all mixed up and you cannot shout. And your oxygen starts to run out. If your final gasp has the recipe wrong. And instead of hello you say so long. If your energy starts to leak out. And people wonder what you’re all about. A heartbreaker with an unattached heart. The story of love gives them all a start. And me, I’ve always been this way. Not by choice, just this way. I can’t put my honey pot in a jar. Or a heart or a fist of some young boy. If you can’t put a butterfly in a jar. No wonder no need to wonder where you are. It might seem like hell, the River Styx. Your affection never sticks. No matter what you say, no matter what you do. A butterfly heart flies right past you. There’s nothing to say, nothing to do. See if the ice will melt for you. Iced honey"

There is nothing you can do. So gather round young warriors now. and saddle up your steeds. Killing scores with demon swords. Now is the death of doers of wrong. Swing the judgment hammer down.

Find a piece of me in all.... Inside you all,. So, bow down. Sell your soul to me. I will set you free. Pacify your demons. Bow down. Surrender unto me. Submit infectiously. Sanctify your demons. Into abyss,. You don't exist.. Cannot resist,. The Judas kiss."
the mechanix,Imagine you were at my station. And you brought your motor to me. Your a burner yeah a real motor car. Said you wanna get your order filled. Made me shiver when I put it in. Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you. Whoever thought you'd be better. At turning a screw than me. I do it for my life. Made my drive shaft crank. Made my pistons bulge. Made my ball bearing melt from the heat. We were shifting hard when we took off. Put tonight all four on the floor. When we hit top end you know it feels to slow. I'm giving you my room service. And ya know it's more than enough. Oh one more time ya know I'm in love. Solo-Mustaine

welcome home (sanitarium),"Welcome to where time stands still. No one leaves and no one will. Moon is full, never seems to change. Just labeled mentally deranged. Dream the same thing every night. I see our freedom in my sight. No locked doors, no windows barred. No things to make my brain seem scarred. Sleep my friend and you will see. That dream is my reality. They keep me locked up in this cage. Can't they see it's why my brain says rage. Sanitarium, leave me be. Sanitarium, just leave me alone. Build my fear of what's out there. And cannot breathe the open air. Whisper things into my brain. Assuring me that I'm insane. They think our heads are in their hands. But violent use brings violent plans. Keep him tied, it makes him well. He's getting better, can't you tell?. No more can they keep us in. Listen, damn it, we will win. They see it right, they see it well. But they think this saves us from our hell. Sanitarium, leave me be. Sanitarium, just leave me alone. Sanitarium, just leave me alone. Fear of living on. Natives getting restless now. Mutiny in the air. Got some death to do. Mirror stares back hard. Kill, it's such a friendly word. Seems the only way. For reaching out again"
when a blind man cries,"If you're leaving close the door.. I'm not expecting people anymore.. Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.. Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.. I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.. That's when a blind man cries,. Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.. Had a friend once in a room,. had a good time but it ended much too soon.. In a cold month in that room. we found a reason for the things we had to do.. I'm a blind man,. I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.. That's when a blind man cries,. Lord, you know he feels it from his soul."

wherever i may roam,"...And the road becomes my bride. I've stripped of all but pride. So in her I do confide. And she keeps me satisfied. Gives me all I need. ...And with dust in throat I crave. Only knowledge will I save. To the game you stay a slave. Rover, wanderer. Nomad, vagabond. Call me what you will. But I'll take my time anywhere. Free to speak my mind anywhere. And I'll redefine anywhere. Anywhere I roam. Where I lay my head is home. ...And the earth becomes my throne. I adapt to the unknown. Under wandering stars I've grown. By myself but not alone. I ask no one. ...And my ties are severed clean. The less I have, the more I gain. Off the beaten path I reign. Rover, wanderer. Nomad, vagabond. Call me what you will. But I'll take my time anywhere. I'm free to speak my mind anywhere. And I'll never mind anywhere. Anywhere I roam. Where I lay my head is home. But I'll take my time anywhere. I'm free to speak my mind. And I'll take my find anywhere. Anywhere I roam. Where I lay my head is home. But I'll take my time anywhere. Free to speak my mind anywhere. And I'll redefine anywhere. Anywhere I roam. Where I lay my head is home. Carved upon my stone. My body lies, but still I roam. Wherever I may roam. Wherever I may roam. Wherever I may roam"
