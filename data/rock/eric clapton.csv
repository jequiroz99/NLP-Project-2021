Blue moon. You know just what I was there for. You heard me saying a prayer for. Someone I really could care for. And then there suddenly appeared before me. The only one my arms will ever hold. I heard somebody whisper please adore me. And when I looked the moon had turned to gold. Blue moon. Now I'm no longer alone. Without a dream in my heart. Without a love of my own.

Because you can find my mind, please be with me. . Of all the better things I've heard. Loving you has made the words. And all the rest seem so absurd. When in the end it all comes out, I'm sure."

Don't you know we're riding with the king?. A tuxedo and shiny 335.. You can see it in his face, the blue never lie.. Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings.. And don't you know we're riding with the king?. I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old. With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold.. I had a guitar hanging just about waist high. And I'm gonna play this thing until the day I die.. Don't you know we're riding with the king?. Don't you know we're riding with the king?. Riding, you're riding with the king.. You're riding, you're riding with the king."

Drowning in a river of tears,. Drowning in a river,. Feels like I'm drowning,. Drowning in a river. Oh how long must this go on,. Drowning in a river,. Drowning in a river of tears"

Watched the waves breaking in,. We're enjoying the view.. Then I heard myself saying,. ""We should do this more often,. To watch the little ones playing,. On that bright stony shore."". And I wished deep down in my heart,. That we could stay here forever.. In these sweet simple moments,. That will come back no more.. When it's 3 o'clock in the morning,. And something scared you from your breast,. I will gently rock you in my arms,. And lay your little head on my chest,. And when you run, from my arms,. Know we'll always find you.. And when you run, out of loving,. And run home to me. (Run home to me). And the years fly by so quickly,. Like a plane before my eyes,. And you've grown up into a woman,. Before I had time, had time to realize.. And then you'll run, from my arms,. And we'll always come and find you.. And when you run, out of loving,. Then run home to me.. Lord when you run, run out of my arms,. We will always come and find you,. And when you run, out of loving,. Then run home to me. (Run home to me)"
run so far,"by George Harrison. You fly. Out as your smile wears thin. I sigh. Knowing the mess you're in. And you know that you can't get away. And you know you can't hide it from yourself. Lonely days, heavy heart. No escape, can only run so far. I know. Something I ought to say. Stuck here. Trying to find a way. And you know that you can't get away. And you know you can't hide it from yourself. Lonely nights, blue guitar. No way out, can only run so far. Lonesome tears, at the bar. One way street, can only run so far. I pray. That you might make it through. Those teardrops. Now seems a part of you. And you know that you can't get away. And you know you can't hide it from yourself. Fallin' down, under par. Can't get out, can only run so far. Lonely days, heavy heart. No escape, can only run so far. Lonesome tears, at the bar. One way street, can only run so far."
runaway train,"by Elton John, Bernie Taupin and Olle Romo. There's a hungry road I can only hope's. Gonna eat me up inside.. There's a drifting spirit coming clean. In the eye of a lifelong fire.. Tell Monday I'll be around next week;. I'm running ahead of my days.. In the shotgun chance that scattered us,. I've seen the error of my ways.. Oh oh oh, oh oh oh.. Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns. Like sun gods spitting rain.. Found a way home written on this map. Like red dye in my veins.. In the hardest times that come around,. The fear of losing grows.. I've lost and seen the world shut down;. It's a darkness no one knows.. Oh oh oh, oh oh oh.. And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain.. I'm standing in a station waiting in the rain.. I'm starting to feel a little muscle again,. But love is lost like a runaway train.. I'm out of control and out of my hands.. I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land.. I'm trying to get a grip on my life again.. Nothing hits harder than a runaway train.. Oh oh oh, oh oh oh.. Third Verse. And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain.. I'm standing in a station waiting in the rain.. I'm starting to feel a little muscle again,. But love is lost like a runaway train.."

For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white laced lips.. And you see a girl's brown body dancing through the turquoise,. And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea.. And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body,. Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind.. The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers,. And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter.. Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell,. And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the distant sands. With tales of brave Ulysses; how his naked ears were tortured. By the sirens sweetly singing.. The tiny purple fishes run lauging through your fingers,. And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter.."

when somebody thinks you're wonderful,When somebody thinks you're wonderful. What a difference in your day. Seems as though your troubles disappear. Like a feather in your way. When somebody thinks you're wonderful. Tells you with a smile so sweet. What are little stones you step on. Just a meadow 'neath your feet. And how you meet the morning. And gaily swing along. At night you may be weary. But your heart still sings a song. When somebody thinks you're wonderful. Love is mighty close to you. Just another thing more wonderful. Making all her dreams come true. And how you meet the morning. And gaily swing along. At night you may be weary. But your heart still sings a song. When somebody thinks you're wonderful. Love is mighty close to you. Just another thing more wonderful. Making all her dreams come true
when you got a good friend,"When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side [2x]. Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right. I mistreated my baby, but I can´t see no reason why [2x]. Anytime I think about it, I just wring my hands and cry. Wonder, could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me. Mmm, or would she sympathize with me. She´s a brownskin woman, just as sweet as a girlfriend can be. Mmm, baby I may be right or wrong. Baby, it your opinion, I may be right or wrong. Watch your close friend, baby, then you enemies can´t do you no harm. When you got a good friend that will stay right by your side [2x]. Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right"
when you're gone,"Like a shadow on my wall. you can make my neckskin crawl. and you don't have to say or do a thing at all. to catch me when I fall. Like the bloom of dandelions. you send shivers down my spine. and I will never lose my faith when you're mine. to me you are devine. When you're gone. there's a song to support me. when you're here. you're the song I hear. you bring music everywhere. Like an angel from above. you're an undivided love. and when I close my eyes it's you I'm thinking of. peace you bring, little dove. When you're gone. there's a song to support me. when you're here. you're the song I hear. you bring music everywhere. And the stars form constellations in your eyes. maybe that's why it's so hard to say goodbye. and your precence makes me more than flesh and bone. but when you slip away my inside turns to stone. when you're here. you're a song my dear. you bring music everywhere"
while my guitar gently weeps,I look at you all. See the love there that's sleeping. While my guitar gently weeps. I look at the floor. And I see it needs sweeping. Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know why nobody told you. How to unfold your love. I don't know how someone controlled you. They bought and sold you. I look at the world. And I notice it's turning. While my guitar gently weeps. With every mistake. We must surely be learning. Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know how you were diverted. You were perverted too. I don't know how you were inverted. No one alerted you. I look at you all. See the love there that's sleeping. While my guitar gently weeps. I look at you all. Still my guitar gently weeps. http://www.vagalume.com.br/the-beatles/while-my-guitar-gently-weeps.html#ixzz1vMXQeD00

white room,"by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown. In the white room with black curtains near the station.. Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.. Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.. Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment.. I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;. Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.. You said no strings could secure you at the station.. Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.. I walked into such a sad time at the station.. As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.. I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;. Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.. At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.. Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.. Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.. She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.. I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;. Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.."
why does love got to be so sad,"by Eric Clapton and Bobby Whitlock. Got to find me a way. To take me back to yesterday.. How can I ever hope to forget you?. Won't you show me a place. Where I can hide my lonely face?. I know you're going to break my heart if I let you.. Why does love got to be so sad?. Why does love got to be so sad?. Why does love got to be so sad?. Why does love got to be so sad?. Like a moth to a flame,. Like a song without a name,. I've never been the same since I met you.. Like a bird on the wing,. I've got a brand new song to sing,. I can't keep from singing about you.. Chorus. I'm beginning to see. What a fool you've made of me.. I might have to break the law when I find you.. Stop running away;. I've got a better game to play,. You know I can't go on living without you.. Chorus."
willie and the hand jive,"Got a cool little chick named Rocking Millie.. He can walk and stroll and Susie Q. And do that crazy hand jive, too.. Mama, mama, look at Uncle Joe. Doing the hand jive with sister Flo.. Grandma gave baby sister a dime;. Said, ""Do that hand jive one more time."". Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive,. Do that crazy jive.. Doctor and a lawyer and an Indian chief,. They all dig that crazy beat.. Way-Out Willie gave them all a treat. When he did that hand jive with his feet.. Chorus. Willie and Millie got married last fall.. They had a little Willie junior and that ain't all.. Well, the kids got crazy and it's plain to see,. Doing the hand jive on T.V.. Chorus."
wish you were here,"So, so you think you can tell. Heaven from Hell. Blue skys from pain. Can you tell a green field. From a cold steel rail?. A smile from a veil?. Do you think you can tell?. And did they get you to trade. Your heroes for ghosts?. Hot ashes for trees?. And hot air for a cool breeze?. Cold comfort for change?. And did you exchange. A walk on part in the war. For a lead role in a cage?. How I wish. How I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls. Swimmin' in a fish bowl. Year after year. Running over the same old ground. What have we found?. The same old fears. And I wish that you were here. Oh, how I wish you were here. How I wish. How I wish you were here. Running over the same old ground. What have we found?. The same old fears. And I wish that you were here. Thank you. I wish they were here."
wonderful tonight,"It's late in the evening. She's wonderin' what clothes to wear. She puts on her make-up. And brushes her long blond hair. And then she asks me, ""do I look all right?"". And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight. We go to a party. And everyone turns to see. This beautiful lady. Walkin around with me. And then she asks me, ""do you feel all right?"". And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight. I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes. And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realize. How much I love you. It's time to go home now. And I've got an achin' head. So I give her the car keys. And she helps me to bed. And then I tell her. As I turn out the light. I say my darlin', you were wonderful tonight. Oh, my darling, you were wonderful tonight"
world of pain,"by Gail Collins and Felix Pappalardi. Outside my window is a tree.. Outside my window is a tree.. There only for me.. And it stands in the gray of the city,. No time for pity for the tree or me.. There is a world of pain. In the falling rain. Around me.. Is there a reason for today?. Is there a reason for today?. Do you remember?. I can hear all the cries of the city,. No time for pity for a growing tree.. Chorus. First Verse. Chorus."

wrapping paper,"by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown. Wrapping paper in the gutter. Moving slowly as the wind on the sea,. (Faces calling, waves moving). In your picture on a wall of a house of old times.. (Can you hear me) Can you hear me. (Can you hear me) Wandering sadly?. In the city, feeling pretty,. Down and out and making love to you on the shore,. (Ruined buildings, faces empty). In the picture as I gaze ahead and don't see. (That they're calling) That they're calling.. (That they're calling) Wandering sadly.. Shattered windows, stairs to nowhere.. (Hear you calling) Hear you calling. (Hear you calling) As I wander so sadly.. Wish I knew what you'd done to me;. Turned me on to things I never knew.. It's all broken, weeds are growing.. Wish I was going home to the house by the shore. (Where you loved me) Where you loved me,. (Where you loved me) Loved me so sadly.. Someday I'll get back, somehow I'll do it.. I'll arrive there and you'll be there to meet me.. (Walk together, tread the weeds down). Kiss again in the picture on the wall. (Where I loved you) In the old house.. (Where I loved you) Loved you so well.."
