summertime,"Summertime the weather is easy.. Fish are jumping out. And the cotton is high. Your daddy's rich. And your ma is good-looking. So hush, pretty baby. Don't you cry, don't you cry.. One of these mornings. You've got to rise up singing,. Then you're spread your wings. And you'll take to the sky. But until that morning,. That ain't nothing can be and you. Please daddy and mammy. Standing by. Don't you cry, oh baby. Don't you cry"
