my time is now,"[Chorus: John Cena]. Your time is up, my time is now. You can't see me, my time is now. It's the franchise, boy I'm shinin now. You can't see me, my time is now!. In case you forgot or fell off I'm still hot - knock your shell. off. My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off. The franchise, doin big bid'ness, I live this. It's automatic I win this - oh you hear those horns, you. finished. A soldier, and I stay under you fightin. Plus I'm stormin on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning. Ain't no way you breakin me kid, I'm harder than nails. Plus I keep it on lock, like I'm part of the jail. I'm slaughterin stale, competition, I got the whole block wishin. they could run with my division but they gone fishin -. - with no bait, kid your boy hold weight. I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate. In any weather I'm never better your boy's so hot. you'll never catch me in the next man's sweater. If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan. Lay yo' ass DOWN for the three second TAN. [Chorus]. Yeah, uhh. It's gon' be what it's gon' be. Five pounds of courage buddy, bass tint pants with a gold T. Uhh - it's a war dance and victory step. A raw stance is a gift, when you insist it's my rep. John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so. And talk about the bread you make but don't know the recipe for. dough though. Aimin guns in all your photos, that's a no-no. When this pop, you'll liplock, your big talk's a blatant no-show. See what happens when the ice age melt. You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps. I rock a timepiece by Benny if any. The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all. condemn me. A man's measured by the way that he thinks. Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks. I spent 20 plus years seekin knowledge of self. So for now Marc Predka's livin live for wealth. [Chorus] - 2X"

broken dreams (drew mcintyre theme),"What's that metronome I hear. Perhaps the end is drawing near. You never hear the shot that takes you down. Now your dreams are memories. Seems more truthful far away. Just like smoke that fades and makes no sound. Out of time, so say goodbye. What is yours, now is mine. And I dream broken dreams. I make them come true. I make them for you. I make them for you. Almost to the mountaintop. You slip and fall just like a stone. Rolling ever faster to this nightmare you have sown. You had it all right in your grasp. But in a breath, your minute passed. Now at last the end has come, you are all alone. Out of time, so say goodbye. What is yours, now is mine. And I dream broken dreams. I make them come true. I make them for you. I make them for you. All your dreams are just illusioned. Based on nothing and confusion. Don't you look behind the curtain. No more time, the end is certain. I dream broken dreams, I make them come true, I make them for you. I dream broken dreams, I make them come true, I make them for you. Bad dreams come true, I make them for you (I make dreams come true). Bad dreams come true, I make them for you (I make them for you). Bad dreams come true, I make them for you (I make dreams come true). Bad dreams come true, I make them for you (I make them for you)"

christian,"If you close your eyes your life, a naked truth revealed. Dreams you never dreamed, and scars never healed. In the darkness, light will take you to the other side. You'll find me waiting there. You'll see if you just close your eyes. Deceived by my eyes and all I was told I should see. Opinions not mine, the person they taught me to be. One night in the dark, a vision of someone I knew. And in the darkness I heard, a voice say, I'm you.. Inside me a light was turned on. Then I was alive. Hearts uninspired, trapped inside somebody's dream. Too close to the fire, yet cold and numb with the pain. But the fever has broken, and the river has run to the sea. Washed to the ocean, and saved by a voice inside me.. Inside me a light was turned on. Then I was alive. If you close your eyes your life, a naked truth revealed. Dreams you never dreamed, and scars never healed. In the darkness, light will take you to the other side. You'll find me waiting there. You'll see if you just close your eyes. Never thought I would be here, so high in the air. This was my unanswered prayer. Defined by another, so much wasted time. Out of the darkness, each breath that I take will be mine. If you close your eyes your life, a naked truth revealed. Dreams you never dreamed, and scars never healed. In the darkness, light will take you to the other side. You'll find me waiting there. You'll see if you just close your eyes"

don't fuck with us,"[John Cena]. We keep it hoppin like the cars with the shocks. We spittin heat on your block. We new to the game, but runnin the spot. Numbin your knot, with basslines that'll make ya neck break. This rook'll take your queen and put ya king in checkmate. Open your mind without makin ya meditate. We real champs; y'all just featherweight. Time to get it straight, I push your wig back. Crew loaded up with extra bread like a Big Mac. Beefin with us? We're leavin you face down. Stompin bitch rappers like I'm straight outta A-Town. Runnin the playground like it was a track meet. Shoes on the whip that be bigger than Shaq's feet. We into big things, bank account's overgrown. All types of cheese - swiss, cheddar, provolone. Guaranteed to burn wax like candles. Track hittin hard to the head like shots of Jack Daniels. [Chorus 2X: John Cena]. Y'all, bitch, crews, don't wanna fuck with us. Y'all bound, to, lose, another one bites the dust. [Tha Trademarc]. It's Trademarc the truth, laid back, aloof. I'm God, as if you needed some proof. You ain't hard I can see it on you, {?}. Fuck a droptop, crop if I'm creepin on you. Click-clack nickelback knickknacks if you got heaters on you. Spittin back live rounders, with five pounders. If we meetin on two, I put a beatin on you. Your sound's tired buddy, that's why I'm sleepin on you. We lean back in the ride, with cream stackin the rawhide. The sound of God slide with a raw vibe.

You slow, you be the last to think. My hands seen more fuckin dirt than bathroom sinks. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. I got punks, dumps and switches, dump chumpses bitches. We feed you to the sharks, you can sleep with the fishes. Clean you like dishes but I ain't no busboy. You ain't family, you ain't earnin my trust boy. Seen too many bitches that'll double cross ya. We bring more drama than the Laker roster. Get the click pissed, ain't nobody can save ya. Throw heat without lookin like Fernando Valenzuela. [Tha Trademarc]. Marc Predka's the name, the rest of you lame. I'm ego drivin, seen with different women, every size and frame. I refine my game by fuckin famous bitches. But it's all the same, it's just ex to the next. for sex or brain, misses or Mrs.. Married or not, my game don't stop. It's cars bars bonds and stocks you ain't see my flow.

end of days wade barret,"I've had enough, I'll make 'em see. They'll never take another drop of blood from me. And judge you all, one final bow. I'll be your end of days. Blood in the streets, the royals fall. I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me. Where they will see, I'll be your end of days. I'll be your end of days. Black-robed judges bring the gavel down, goodbye. Tell me all the ways that I went wrong. They'd lock us up forever, given half a chance. Out of sight, out of mind, same old dance. Keep the rebels down, kill their every sound. The more you try to silence me, the more I'm gaining ground. I've had enough, I'll make 'em see. They'll never take another drop of blood from me. And judge you all, one final bow. I'll be your end of days. Blood in the streets, the royals fall. I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me. Where they will see, I'll be your end of days. I'll be your end of days. Painted smile, glad hands, pick your pocket, money gone. Laughing to themselves, and forget your name. Make up any promise as they go and sell your future. We all had a vote, tell me who's to blame. Keep the rebels down, kill their every sound. The more you try to silence me, the more I'm gaining ground. I've had enough, I'll make 'em see. They'll never take another drop of blood from me. And judge you all, one final bow. I'll be your end of days. Blood in the streets, the royals fall. I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me. Where they will see, I'll be your end of days. I'll be your end of day"

I embarass MC's who touch the mic with me. That's why they never holla when it's showtime - gimme. I spit poison like a black snake bit me. Guns up in the E-Class, D's can't get me. My foot is a 13, 12's don't fit me. My heart is cold and hard like Jack Frost bit me. So many new flows old flows start to panic. It's time they got built by the mic mechanic. Y'all heard, I stay in hood streets like curbs. And never forget, where I come from, word. I ain't goin broke, fuck you, I'll cop me a brick. And take it straight to the block, forget rap quick. Don't trip, Bump got a speed zone sign. For suckers who move too fast against mine. I'm pressed, pushin it full speed ahead. You left, bullet in chest, meet the dead, so. [Chorus].

Philosopher first, rapper second. Manifest the message, lessons involved. It all but hits you, aviate your crew and lift you. So what's the issue? Trademarc has got it locked before he meet. you. Greet your mind before we even greet you. Won't mislead you, I ain't trustin people, cause I defeat you. Take it down a notch, slow your roll. Cause we crush spirits, like we stole your soul. I set styles off dog, y'all are fuckin mimics. Man I talk more shit than pro-lifers in abortion clinics. Run my mouth off like high school rumors. Man and grab microphones like pedophiles gropin late bloomers. Flow easy like your first day with white sneakers. You just a face in the crowd like packed bleachers. Huh, you better rock a sleeveless. Freddie Foxxx, Trademarc, John Cena breeze through. Y'all are fuckin divas. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. First and foremost I sure post potential like Carmelo. Turn a hard MC to jello. Make their skin yellow with fear while stayin mellow and clear. Man, we in for one hell of a year, yeah. Curse a fool like the Red Sox, we tighter than headlocks. I'm flowin easy with Freddie Foxxx. Known to hang it low like dreadlocks and y'all are too slow. Like wearing a weight vest and lead socks. I'm a fat kid, you feed me? I'm still hungry. Never let a bitch take a bill from me. Like Jordan in the 4th quarter, I'm still money. Best believe the flow water, we still runny. Make your stomach feel funny, I'm so sick. With 16 bars twice the value of gold brick. Make it known quick that I'm greedy, we got the rats and the. cheese B. So believe me. [Chorus]"

I got some plans to do shit that ain't never been done. Take this game into battles that ain't never been won. I ain't gon' walk through life, I think it's better to run. And yeah I'm eatin right if you askin. But the size of my wallet that's reflection of passion. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. Just another face in the crowd, so to speak. Huh, my electric was cut off last weak. No heat, no food, no money, no girls. And if life's my oyster then I ain't found pearls. Makin moves every day so the ends could meet. No gas money, so I use my legs and feet. Everybody I meet man, they likely saw. that I be in the same clothes from the night before. Shoes so old you can call 'em retros. Man I'm so damn broke, even my wallet echoes. I got a dollar and change; man, I'm under the gun. That buck's the only thing keepin me from bein a bum. That's why I'm writin these words man, so I can get on. So I can realize bein poor was makin me strong. And the only reason I can't rub pennies together. is cause I carry big bills, in genuine leather. [Chorus]. [Cena] Shakin hands with some fans by the thousands. [Marc] My place so poor, looks like public housin. [Cena] Gettin the Porsche when I shoulda got the CL6. [Marc] My ride broke down, I'ma kinda between whips. [Cena] Face on the X-Box, you played the game lately?. [Marc] Man I can't rent, I owe too much in late fees. [Cena] Do I, charter a jet, or fly first class?. [Marc] Do I take a cab? Bus seats hurt my ass. [Cena] Pay my jeweler in cash, he don't take a check. [Marc] The chain I rock, leaves a green mark on my neck. [Cena] Do I get the filet steak or the shrimp & crab mix?. [Marc] Do I get a number 3 or a number 6?. [Cena] Get in the club V.I.P. man they lettin me slide. [Marc] Man they bust me for dress code, I'm still outside. [Cena] Everybody wanna be down, but I ain't got no friends. [Marc] Man nobody's around, I ain't got no friends. [Chorus]"
just close your eyes,"Deceived by my eyes and all I was told I should see. Opinions not mine, the person they taught me to be. One night in the dark, a vision of someone I knew. And in the darkness I saw, a voice say, I'm you.. Inside me a light was turned on Then I was alive. CHORUS. If you close your eyes your life, a naked truth revealed. Dreams you never lived, and scars never healed. In the darkness, light will take you to the other side. and find me waiting there you'll see, if you just close your eyes. Hearts uninspired, trapped inside somebody's dream. Too close to the fire, yet cold and numb with the pain. But the fever has broken, and the river has run to the sea. Washed to the ocean, and saved by a voice inside me.. Inside me a light was turned on Then I was alive. CHORUS. Never thought I would be here, so high in the air. This was my unanswered prayer. Defined by another, so much wasted time. Out of the darkness, each breath that I take will be mine. CHORUS"
kane's theme,"Kane's Theme Lyrics. The wonder of the world is gone I know for sure.. All the wonder that I want I've found in her.. As a whole becomes a part I strike to burn.. And the flame returns.. Every intuition fails to find its way.. One more table turned around and back again.. Finding I'm more lost than found when she's not around.. When she's not around I feel it coming down.. Chorus:. Get me what I could never ask for.. Connect me and you could be my chemical, now.. Give me the drug you know I'm after.. Connect me and you could be my chemical.. When everybody wants (the chemical of) your soul.. When everybody wants (the chemical of) your soul.. When everybody wants your soul.. When everybody wants your soul.. Chorus (x2). You could be the chemical."
know the rap,"[Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]. Hahahaha.... Y'all know the rep, yeah, listen. My name is Bumpy Knuckles, I write that fuckin flame. And kill for the right price I got a buckin name. My forty caliber too fresh, stuck in aim. We roll like 18 wheelers in the truckin game. I'm nice with mics there's nothin more I like. than to paralyze your left side and leave you all right. I be layin front of your crib with Tec-y all night. Tryin to get them 9 millimeters loaded up tight, listen. I'm like a Cadillac, I write a battle rap. so smooth contest you'll be out of that. Y'all know the beef is stewin, that Bumpy came to ruin. You may be signed but you don't know what the fuck you doin. I make aight hot, I make dope raw. And send you higher than a long Colt four-four. You know the only rap pimp that kept a ho poor. And slam a fool on his back and break the whole floor. [Chorus: Bumpy Knuckles]. A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop. We keep on, once the cops are gone. This is real street spit you best be warned. Tell your favorite MC the mic is on. A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop. We keep on, once the cops are gone. [John Cena]. Yeah, yeah. It's the J daddy, not Hov' or Jam Master. My mic is correct, but y'all know the hands faster. See you bitch rappers I'm attackin the pile. Y'all be cryin foul cause I'm hackin your style. I make sure you and your mans done. When I see y'all both drop, I'm the cat screamin And1. You see me on the team dog you know the game's over. Stones on my wrist, and a chip on my shoulder. Sixteens cashin in on another hot beat. Go cop me a drop with the butterscotch seats. And we better not meet, if we do you gon' see a change. Make sure you whole FACE gettin rearranged. We rollin up in the blacked out truck dog. It's Freddie Foxxx, now you deal with Corrupt Mob. It's gas on the fire, any time a track blaze. Squad known to beef up the Heat, just like the Shaq trade. [Tha Trademarc]. This my 9 to 5, this ain't no hobby cat. Copycat killers bite styles, my rhyme piles is heavy. Give me a beat, man I'll body that. Spittin that heat street raps man they nod to that. What you smilin at? You R&B, man that's hardly rap. You lost the beat, man you bought a map. Matter fact, here's my next rap, borrow that. Been off the street too long, I want my corner back. You ain't a player, you a armchair quarterback. You ride the beat like side streets on a flat. Don't play dumb, I know where you came from. You only seen slugs buddy after the rain come. Keep it subtle, Trademarc got you bitch. like babies suckin tits talkin 'bout mami let's cuddle. It's gon' be what it's gon' be, you duck down. A quiet cat with a violent rap, what now?. [Chorus]"

Cause we're about to light it up. It's on tonight. So hold on. Cause we're about to... about to light it up. Hey. There's no mistake. Cause I'm a hard time sinner. With a bullet to waste.

Your daddy tells you not to play my game. But what I'm sellin' baby she can't deny. I ignite. So hold on. Cause we're about to light it up. It's on tonight. So hold on. Cause we're about to....

make it loud,"[john cena at a live show]. It's the joint baby, gotta make it loud [crowd cheers]. So let me hear some noise from the crowd [more cheering]. [tazz] that's noise!.

Yeah, yeah. We came to kick the door down, it's time to hit the floor now. Yo... we got some shit in store now. So; clap your hands while we let the sax blow. Not quite crispy green, but we came to stack dough. We ain't maxed yo, we just try and get this money right. Bills made of spandex, i still keep my money tight. Never stoppin, all i see is the money like. The kid on the mic is too +raw+ for your monday night. If you got in free, or your fuckin cover's paid. Bounce to this motherfucker like you was some rubbermaid. This ain't that cristal sippin type shit. It's that bottle breakin, startin riot type shit. So jump up and down 'til ya break the floor. Yo we keep it underground like a basement tour. East coast reppin, stretchin out to l.a.. Not double oh seven but we +die another day+, what. [chorus]. [tha trademarc]. I tear up any track, front to back. Like roy jones takin on fifty year-old cats. Makin comebacks, where you at, cats spit soft shit. Like whispers and gloves, i'm not hearin that. It's all love maybe if you wanna rub baby. Anything but that, step back lady. Trademarc, john cena, clubbin it up. We got chaos on the one and two, cuttin it up. I'm all about laid back, don't jock, i hate that. I see through haters games, don't mistake that. I still got love if you buyin our shit. If you claim you hatin us, but you ridin our dicks.

Tough to bring down like an overweight runningback. Yeah - and we blaze 'em baby. Trademarc, john cena, we amazin baby. Yo we tear up any crew, leave a motherfucker worn. Y'all are just soft like some cinemax porn. [tha trademarc]. I move a crowd like a bomb scare. Grab the mic when we hittin it right, if you want fear. Some say trademarc, he ain't all there. We old school like when sonny, was on cher. Take it back like a richard pyror 8-track. And grab a chunk of your change like a state tax. Man please, we want platinum plaques. I want cream, green, cheddar cheese, to grab in stacks. [chorus]. [scratching trademarc to fade]. ""chaos on the one and two, cuttin it up"". ""that's that shit!"".

So come on let me lead you through the wilderness. I'm a Man with a Plan. They come from from all over saying, help me please. I can't see the wood from the proverbial trees. It ain't as simple as a minor compass. Show the shadows in the alley getting ready to jump. The trick is to look with your head, now dont be blinded. The people of the turf don't need to be reminded. They're only as good as their last idea. A future guarentee - get outta here!. I'm a man with a plan. To all of you out there, waiting on tables. (something) tropical laying down cables. Tune into the plan on broadcast news. Youre still wasting your time man, lookin for clues. Cause there aint no need for you to scrape up somethin. Was a man (something). Or everybody complain that theyre losing game. Take one step forward when you hear this name!. I'm a man with a plan. I'm a man with a plan, yeah. I'm a man with a plan, you know I'm ready. I'm a man with plan, can do anything cause I'm a man with a plan.. I'm a man with a plan, you know whats up I'm a man with a plan.. Guess what - I'm a man with a plan..

Show all the way to make it right!. Make it! to the top of mt. profession!. Rule it! until you feel there's nothing more for you to do!. Or say! ""none of you better get in my way!. Coming down! if ya do you'll be back on level ground!"". -jeff hardy"

What this is, forgot?. I must now remind you. Let it rock. Let it rock. Let it rock. . Now the son's disgraced. He, who knew his father. When he cursed his name. Turned and chased the dollar.

the king of kings (triple h),"Behold the King, the King of Kings.. On your knees dog. All hail.. Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. The King grinned red as he walked from the blaze,. Where the traitor lost both his name and his face.. Through the halls and the corridors stinging in blood,. He tasted his grin and it tasted good.. The King took his head. Left him broken and dead.. Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. The King left none living, none able to tell.. The King took their heads and he sent them to hell.. Their screams echoed loud in the place of their death.. Ripped open they died. With their final breath.. They hailed to the King, the King of Kings.. Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. Into the dirt, his will be done.. Now feel your fear, there can be only one.. Bow down, bow down, bow down to the .... Bow down, bow down, bow down, bow down to the .... Bow down, bow down to the.... Bow down to the, bow down to the King.. Bow down to the .... Bow down, bow down, bow down.. The King is here, now feel your fear.. The King of Kings.. All hail, all hail the King..

this is how we roll,"[Chorus: repeat 2X]. Wheels is shinin.. deals we signin.. money's pilin... Low, this is how we roll. [John Cena]. Catch me in the black 'llac truck with the pickup back. The game weak, I'ma pick up slack. Hands high like a stick-up jack, fuck your boring rap. This East to West coast hittin like Warren Sapp. I'm fully focused, I walk with a purpose. Y'all are fuckin clowns, you belong in a circus. This is big bid'ness, we don't stop 'til the money home. Block shakin more buzz than a honeycomb. And I'm a savage in the booth. I'm on some movement shit, about to rally up the youth. Number one seed daddy walkin through the playoffs. You better quit rappin 'fore I start makin layoffs. Fuck a day off, I'm movin heavy for the payoff. You don't ride to this? We don't need you, stay off. Hate on this? I don't care what you said. Y'all can choke on a shit sandwich with no bread. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. I don't smile as such, buddy, ain't much funny. You touchy girlie rappers claimin that you fuckin gully. I live poor but look rich, I hit raw, you look bitch. You love me, that's why you got your style from me. Most sayin Marc Predka's overconfident. It's only cause they jeally that my profile is prominent. The dominant factor is the money I'm after. Your opinion ain't mean shit buddy - I ain't ask ya. It's gon' be what it's gon' be. It is what it is and was what it was so watch ya wordplay. Trademarc lay you where the buzzards and birds play. I write rhymes 'til ya boy is heard mayne. Cause alls I got, is my voice and word. Sophisticated rapper the dapper lover the don. It's on baby pah yeah word is bond. Cut the check and I'll rock, every word of the song - what now?. . [Chorus]. [John Cena]. Yeah, yeah... yeah. I got that velcro flow, I'll make you stick to this. So many zeroes, my monetary is ridiculous. A glass of Chardonnay doesn't whine like you. I'm an Altered Beast with Einstein's IQ. Plus I shine bright too and I ride right through. In a leaned out, old school, skylight blue. I don't think there's a player nice. Keep your Cristal, I'm shoot Jagermeister. Foot to the floor and you ain't you keep the pace. Throw me a whore and call me Kobe cause you know that I'ma beat. the case. I buy some land, and never even see the place. Vegeterian chicks, go on givin meat a taste. Throw away money like I hate on loot. Copped your CD it sounds great on mute. Words turn 'em to dust makin MC's disintergrate. My name get traffic like the California interstate, what?. [Chorus]"

Outnumbered but outgunning. We're fearless and crowd stunning. Never an error on record. There's no one to protect ya'. And we would still be right here. If all the money was burned. But we stay bumping in your ear. Cause the money was earned, yo. You can find us climbing setting the bar. Or you could find us red carpet when we hitting it hard.

what now,"[Chorus: female singer]. I... will get by. Touch the sky, time to fly, 'til we die. [Tha Trademarc]. For what it's worth I see the purpose of life. I see below the surface and the version that you know and hold. is not right. Hahaha, man I oughta just laugh. The only darkness ahead of me's the shadow I cast in my path. (What's that?) That's the weight of my craft. I breathe easy, and let my chest slowly contract. And write rhymes to inform baby not to uplift. If you wanna make it all, you gotta persist (yo put me on). Yeah, all that talk's a waste. Cause I can read a man's thoughts by the way the lines cross his. face. Hold five, everything live. And I vibe, ain't nobody thought this day would arrive. But I balance my talents with a hope and a drive. And ride beats dog, that's where my focus derive. And keep notepads and vocab, that's my guide. And if I got legit beef, I don't let it slide - what now. [Chorus]. [John Cena]. My brain is impossible to thinkin philosophical. Hustle in my blood, that's the only thing that's logical. The only thing I gotta do to stay on or stay strong. I ain't stoppin 'til I own the field that y'all play on. Desperado - eyes like a bird of prey. Cold soldier - crack snap your vertebrae. No heater - flow sweeter than Cohiba. Cinnamon dip, spice ride in the cinnamon whip. Quite wide on the benjamin clip. Might slide but we ain't gonna slip - no way. If the meek shall inherit the earth, guess what?. Y'all get the globe if they measure in, lyrical worth. Trademarc flow first, make the mental work. Fuck a verse - I rearrange your dental work. And when it pop off, we not soft. We like the Bentleys; y'all just the Chrysler knockoffs. [Chorus]. [Tha Trademarc]. But that's life, yeah you hearin me right. It's like I had to find the black of night. come back to life with master insight that shine bright - I'm. always learnin. My burden, to blow up gifts like this, I must endure the slow. burnin. It's sort of strange, my philosophy's changed. I take chances, jump before the water's in range. And never wait for safe answers so if all that remains. is lookin back at my life it never seems like I wasted glances. Man it's all a big game, that's why it doesn't mean a thing. That I get money and fame, it's all the same. if you call me Trademarc or if you know my real name. Marc Predka ain't attached to ego. He's a hero for the average people, a blessing. Who transcends the essence of a poet with a street flow. It's not lip service I don't speak to hear myself talk. And I don't wanna be a teacher; I'm grateful for all I've been. taught. [Chorus]"

Like a broken needle kid, you missin the point!. We dominate your conference with offense that's no nonsense. My theme song hits, get your reinforcements!. We strike quick with hard kicks, duckin ice picks. Bare-knuckle men through fight pits, beat you lifeless. Never survive this! get forget like alzheimer's. Two-face rappers, walk away with four shiners. The raw rhymer, turnin legends to old-timers. My incisor's like a viper, bitin through your one-liners!.

Yo' cats couldn't come this hot in the summer heat. Forget two takes, kill y'all birds the first time. Yo' best {shit} ain't, worthy of my filler or worst rhymes. I'm better than nice, check the veteran stripes. Leave you beside yourself with fear, i kill you, and bury you. Twice. Despite the cover of night, trackin your flight. Like guerilla warfare, where the grass is dense. Approachin me is a quick way to get referred to in the past. Tense. Dead that! when the light to mic is on.
