born again,"I want, I want. Should I say I born again, can I just born again. I'm feel like a just today. so give me a just a day. I hope my life wild, I feel free into my mind. . .

fields of shame,"They wanna steal your soul. They wanna make you pray. One more brick in the wall. Let me know have you something to say?. They wanna have control. Get to your mind too fast. Salvation there's no more. Would you pay for your soul?. They're gonna kill your soul. And make you feel self-blame. They want you beg for hope. They wanna buy your faith. See what they do each other. Preach lies, revenge and hate. Holy anger, Unknown Soldier. Fighting in the fields of shame. . Just free your mind instead of. To be a headless mate. You've got nothing to lose put the game off. Nobody can head your fate"
i've got my pride,"Hey you I know, I've got you in the end. God knows, I've got you in the end (bis). Someday you're gonna see that I'm alive. Love and hate are just two. things that you can't hide (bis). I, I've got my pride. I, I've got my pride. Hey you I know, I've got you in the end. God knows, I've got you in the end. You make my heart become cold as ice. Is too late to beg my love,. I've got my pride"
le collectionneur,"Stand by you, all day all night. Watching you I say, don't you cry?. A girl like you once made up my mind. Makes me feel again alive. I know she knows. I have to grown. Make up my mind. I say, I say. I keep myself around. . Until the night is gone. . I won't see you cry. For you"
mad about love,Mad about love. Mad about the things she does. . . Since you've been gone and let me down and alone. I tried to find my own way back home. When I'm with you I use to be weak and blind. Crawling for you while you roll all the dice. . I need to be far from you before I die. I shall be free to get my own destiny
the weird man,"Feelings, all my feelings. Where they come from?. From where they belong?. cause I need them. All my feelings. Let they be flown. Just let them be grown. If you have found. A clue in this sound. To know me at all. Help me not to fall. Would you sail away?. Through seas of regret. Deep in my soul?. Where would you go?. cause I'm weird man I can feel this. I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay. I have no more what to say. I can hear this, I can feel this. I don't wanna go, I don't wanna stay. I have no more what to say"
there's no feeling,"Yes I know, change is come through the air. Yes, I know, let it come through the air. I felt this coming through the air. . And he knows that the voice inside. Is only in his head. Ah! There's a war coming. Ah! There's a fight coming. Ah! Can they count with you?. There's no feeling. (I know he said, I know)"
time to run,"No time to run I hear the bombs at the parking lot. No, I don't want to be one more in the body count. Now the enemy can be the nun of the neighborhood. There is no color; there is no race or royal blood. Who knows can be your lovely son do you wanna see?. And in the end he can be you, he can be me. Now what I say, now what I want and where I go. I am just a puppet; I'm just a toy under control. I'm just a paranoiac freaky trying to save my soul"
you don't know how to treat me right,"Why you tell me lies. When I just give you trues. I don't know!. You treat me like a fool. When I'm falling love with you. I don't know. But now the love is gone and I got to carry on. Find a better place, warm my bones. Try to find a reason to live without your love. Learn to fly again, spread my wings on my own. You don't know (how) treat me right. Fill my soul (honey) with those lies. There're no more alibis. I can't find the truth when I'm looking through your eyes"
