forest sound,"Something that makes you drop high school. Makes you feel fine and that's the goal. Beat those drums and shake your skull. Liberate energy, feel flow. Forest. sound. Saves your soul. Sell your soul. Rock 'n' roll. To the bones, to the bones. To the bones, to the bones. Makes you feel like you are over the top. Shake like a maniac and never stop. Something that makes you break out bad. Rocking to some loud motörhead. Forest. sound. Saves your soul. Sell your soul. Rock 'n' roll. To the bones, to the bones. To the bones, to the bones. You know that we'll be fine. I know that we'll be fine. I know that we'll be fine. And I'm damn right, I'm damn right. Forest. sound. Saves your soul. Sell your soul. Rock 'n' roll. To the bones, to the bones. To the bones, to the bones"
heartfelt,"We've been through many things. Oh woman don't you cry. But I felt I should give up. Oh father don't you cry. I am this way please. Don't you try to change my mind. It's been too long. This is enough to sacrifice. This must've been a heartfelt sight. Please don't cry your heart out tonight. But when it's time. I'll get things right. I know, I know, I know. I know, I know, I know. You said nothing else matters. But I know you lied. God only knows the things. That you must've passed by. This must've been a heartfelt sight. Please don't cry your heart out tonight. But when it's time. I'll get things right. I know, I know, I know. I know, I know, I know. Take good care of me. Like you always did. You set a future that wasn't meant to be. You gotta wait to see. But when it's time. I'll get things right. I know, I know, I know. I know, I know, I know"
homesick,"I want you to know. All that I've been through. But I missed you all it's true. It's been good 'round here. But it's better with you, that's for sure. Please come meet me. I'm on my way and soon I'll be home. The size of this feeling. Is so big to be true it can't be sung. It hurt me to my bones. There is no place like home. Soon I won't be away. Soon I'll be with you. Oh, there you go. The right place for me is where. I really should be feeling so free. Cold or warm nights. Away from all harms, welcoming arms. Look after me, Jesus let me be. Open my eyes to see. God you know how. Don't let me drown in the sea. Wait for me like a stone. There is no place like home. Soon I won't be away. Soon I'll be with you. Oh, there you go. Oh, here I go"
leaving fear,"""all lovers young, all lovers must. Consign to thee, and come to dust. "". Should I tell you? and would you trust?. The heart beats fast and will rest soon. I could not tell the night from noon. A comfort zone in your mind's room. A comfort zone that might end soon. All my life. A fear of new flights, in disguise. Forget the past, and listen to the call. Wipe those tears. Lay on your broken ground. What you seek is more than near. But we've been making it unclear. Another time another damn great year. Your soul is wounded, so severe. The hope is to find peace in here. Or maybe to find out senseless fears. You're head is humming. As you drop these tears. All my life. A fear of new flights, in disguise. Forget the past, and listen to the call. Wipe those tears. Lay on your broken ground. O tempo vem e vai, hoje e sempre, só. Todos assumem seu lugar ao sol"
marriage,I have a woman. I'm a man. Marriage is the story. That I try to understand. Singles live together. Couples fight like fools. Just hope that this story. Doesn't work for me and you. A head in the future and a ring in the hand. We should get together to be kind again. Beauty is in the menu of my favorite type. If we get together the thing's gonna be alright. We should believe in our own hearts. It is just something that flies to me. Our love is here forever. We're having fun for free. The indecisions is in my mind. If you don't help me I'll get crazy. My love is here forever. Just believe in me. I'll tell you something. I'll get out of here. Go abroad to england for one year. The first time I follow my feelings. Forget the things. But you're the only one that I can't leave
