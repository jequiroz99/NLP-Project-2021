I took the pieces of a broken heart. And I had no choice. Heartbreak on the 101. Heartbreak on the 101. I'm over it.... You leave me more damaged every day. you took my entire world and threw it all away. It's cold outside I need a place to lay. So I rest beneath the bridge with the friends that I made. Couldn't really think that I'd just stand aside. Take up something new or start another life. Look at the pieces of a broken heart. And see what it could do. Heartbreak on the 101. Heartbreak on the 101 I'm over it.... Can't think that I'd just slowly fade away. You could put me on the sidewalk with a suitcase. I know it's over and it sounds a bit cliche. But I want you back so bad. Leave the pieces where they lay. And I pray for your return. There's no sign. And I'm sleeping with my one eye open. Just in case you might. No, nothing ever works. It's just a waste of time. I can't seem to get it right. Heartbreak on the 101. Everybody's watching. Come take a look. Heartbreak on the 101. Everybody watch. Everybody look. Heartbreak on the 101.

Slow card the hard to fall. So long times I don't?. I've gone this so long. Something I hardly know. Slow gone.. Finally up the pieces. disrrupted and the birds fly.. Trapped for a moment. The sheriff's department got the wrong guy.. The town is revealed the lone,. Visible winds through the fog.. This slow cruel hands of time,. turning you back into a child."
solemn oath,"Maybe I should go back. I'm gonna think about that. A little bit more like I did before. Miserable and mad. This one kicks like a mule. Plays me for a fool. Breaks all the rules. It's doing it wrong, but it's moving along. Can be very cruel. Right in the door, I'm tired, I'm sore. Nary A Hi, no welcome home. Yet the minute I'm up, it's pissing me off. I was yelling so loud last night. I thought the cops would surely come. Six or six-two-five. Should keep me alive. Keep me alive. Now do a little turn. Careful with your words. Everything is fine. But I'm lucky as fuck. It still ain't enough. Sick to my gut. Having to say. You sit here 'till the coast is clear. I'll send for you one day. I shouldn't repeat it. This sounds ridiculous. And I swore a solemn oath. Never to admit it's the harsh tones of criticism. Seep in to my bones. Look what I did, I'm happy with it. Aren't you happy for me?. I love you so much, I'm gonna throw up. Watch my stuff, hold this for me please. Try not to sound bitter. Or to fondly remember the dark times of the past. Like I don't deserve it or I'm not even worth it. I can do this or that. This or that"

the end's not near,The end's not near. It's here. Alleluia. Spread the cheer. And watch the millenarians. Throw a party for a thousand years. You won't see the pious praying. They'll be too busy flaying. All the martyrs with better ways. To stop the world decaying. If you call me I won't be home. I'm hiding from the kingdom come. They can't see everything on earth. With the satellites and the roving drones. This is why hell is underground. Like a reclaimed bad part of town. We don't want to lose our souls. We're the saints who don't want to be found

the general specific,"If your trials end, are really getting you down. We had a close call, I didn't even see it, then another one, I hardly believed it at all.. What the writers say, it means shit to me now.. Plants and animals, we're on a bender when it's 80 degrees, the end of December was coming on,. Only for you and me.. When the showing up ends, going back to the south, where hungry necks that I know, and runnin'. A blender in a lightning storm, disguised as a blessing I'm sure.. Knowing up here, there comes a fork in the road, pants have gotta go, we're on an island on. The fourth of July, looks like the tide is going home.. In time I'd find a little way to your heart, down to the general store for nothing specific,. Gonna wash my bones in the Atlantic shore - only for you and me"
the great salt lake,"Back of the boat was painted wrecking ball. There was country music playing but he don’t like it all. There was whiskey bottle spilling and a lake it was made of salt. Well look out back there was a note on the door it saying, “Everybody listen we will be the next on the hope ”. Well if you find yourself falling apart. Well I am sure I could steer.

throw my mess,"Don't want to through my mess around. All through the night. One more time. Add a little link to the neighbor's gate. Stumble to the lock. It slow my mind. Slow my mind. Gonna get wasted all night long. Gripping on tight to the cutlery. And when the paranoia come. Thinking about it maybe it's been a while. Ponder it all you like. You can take your time. Getting me arrested was the strangest fate. For showing me that you're mine. But it saved my life. Saved my life. I'll be with you all them years. Now if anybody dies before I'm back. See me laughing through those tears. Baby, won't you bring that hammer down. Doin' it to myself. Just leave these things alone. Playing on a couch with a record on. Wouldn't that be fine. When the days turn cold. Oh, the days turn cold. All the trees are turning gold. When you see me floating with the mercury. When a change of scene come"

"whatever, wherever",What in the world. Would cause you to question that?. How did I come off?. Would lead you to ask. Can I help you along?. Sun in the room. Curtains too soon. The day is coming closer. The dream slipping through me will fade. Inching slowly from slumber. And I love you a lot. Whatever you want. Wherever you are (Wherever you are). Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you roam. Let me tell you babe. Not every moment matters. Across marked jots laid down. Look you're growing faster and faster. Heights that I held you up. Times when I couldn't be at home. And I owe you a lot. Whatever you want. Wherever you are (Wherever you are). Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Times when I couldn't be enough. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Wherever you are

window blues,Erase the facts. The shit was flyin' outta the window. I painted blue. I paint the whole room. When its time to get in trouble. We know just what to do. The screen door swayin'. Now baby gimme something to live for. I been a fool. I been a fool. No revelations in the water. No tears into the booze. In pains the floor. The worried people shaking the whole house. I i take it back. I take it all back. The regret thats got us sayin'. The hounds upon the tracks. And always in time. I'm never looking over my shoulder. I sing to you. I sing it to you. Keeping heads above the water and. Feet into the shoes
