And love is just a camouflage. for what resembles rage again.... So if you love me, let me go.. And run away before I know.. My heart is just too dark to care.. I can't destroy what isn't there.. Deliver me into my fate -. If I'm alone I cannot hate. I don't deserve to have you.... My smile was taken long ago. If I can change I hope I never know. I still press your letters to my lips. And cherish them in parts,. Of me that savor every kiss. I couldn't face a life without your light. But all of that was ripped apart.... When you refused to fight. So save your breath, I will not hear.. I think I made it very clear.. You couldn't hate enough to love.. Is that supposed to be enough?. I only wish you weren't my friend.. Then I could hurt you in the end.. I never claimed to be a saint.... My own was banished long ago. It took the death of hope to let you go. So break yourself against my stones. And spit your pity in my soul. You never needed any help. You sold me out to save yourself. And I won't listen to your shame. You ran away - you're all the same. Angels lie to keep control.... My love was punished long ago. If you still care, don't ever let me know. If you still care, don't ever let me know..."

I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can. A tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away. A skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame. And I cut my need into my heart, I tear it. all apart. I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved. Burn me away, I won't give up tommorow just to lose it all today. I burn away. I burn away. I burn away. I burn away. My isolation is my course. The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source. I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame. Until this war is over I won't ever lose my rage. And I cut my need into my soul,. I guess I'll never know. I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved. Burn me away, I won't give up tommorow just to lose it. all today. Burn me away, I wont become your hero just to fight the life. I saved. Burn me away, I wont give up tommorow just to lose it all, lose it all today"

goodbye,Come on over... come unglued.... It's not easy to see all of you. Help yourselves. Help is on the way. Well there's nothing to lose so now I have something to say. Maybe we can all recognize a moment of silence. Maybe we can finally agree on the same point of view. A long time ago we believed... and we were united. So the last thing on Earth I am ready to do is say... Goodbye. A long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us. This hasn't torn us apart so nothing ever will. How can we know where we are if the sun is behind us?. But this moment will show us the rest of our lives. No one is going to save us this time. No one can know what we're feeling.... So don't even try

killers are quiet,Cycle of life and death supposedly. goes 'round and 'round yet it stops with me. Glorious hunter of my faith I have sinned. Killers are quiet like the the breath of the wind. Filling the shadows with forms of my own. Raised by kindred of Get I was born. Abomination world in disarray. Killers are quiet when they seek the vitae. Reflection beckons a portal shard. Spiritual quest I must stay in guard. Stepping sideways betweens worlds I shift. Killers are quiet when they are born with the gift. Beautiful Anguish cast out by my race. Now one that's Ageless I save my own face. I write my own laws with Death I break bread. Killers are quiet when they come from my head.

snuff,"Bury all your secrets in my skin. Come away with innocence,. And leave me with my sins. The air around me still feels like a cage.

Deliver me into my fate -. If I'm alone I cannot hate. I don't deserve to have you.... My smile was taken long ago. If I can change I hope I never know. I still press your letters to my lips. And cherish them in parts,. Of me that savor every kiss. I couldn't face a life without your light. But all of that was ripped apart.... When you refused to fight. So save your breath, I will not hear.. I think I made it very clear.. You couldn't hate enough to love.. Is that supposed to be enough?. I only wish you weren't my friend.. Then I could hurt you in the end.. I never claimed to be a saint.... My own was banished long ago. It took the death of hope to let you go. So break yourself against my stones. And spit your pity in my soul. You never needed any help. You sold me out to save yourself. And I won't listen to your shame. You ran away - you're all the same. Angels lie to keep control.... My love was punished long ago. If you still care, don't ever let me know. If you still care, don't ever let me know..."
