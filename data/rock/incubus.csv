Oh, what went wrong?. Yeah, I'm down. But not out, and far from done. Hey all! Beware criminal. A prism with an intellect. You throw your light selectively. You stole my glow, a seasoned thief. The blacks of my eyes are turning into opals. Today, I walk. There's nothing here left for me but empty promises. And the thought of all the things I'm never getting back. You came, you saw, you conquered. Everyone. And I'm left here guessing. What went wrong?. Yeah, I'm down. But not out, and far from done. Hey all! Beware criminal. Did you think I wouldn't notice?.

No more perpetual renaissance. With our words we make shapes and our angles can align. Their appetites callous and menacing. It humbles me. When prey softly outwits its predator. Such is a sight to see. Stay wide awake, stay wide awake, yeah. Make haste 'cause predators proceed. Stay wide awake, stay wide awake, yeah. While all the vultures feed"
wish you were here,"I dig my toes into the sand. The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds. Strewn across a blue blanket. I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless.

The sky resembles a back-lit canopy with holes punched in it. I'm counting UFO's, I signal them with my lighter. And in this moment i am happy. Happy. I wish you were here. I wish you were here. I wish you were here. Wish you were here. The world's a rollercoaster. And I am not strapped in. Maybe I should hold with care. But my hands are busy in the air. Saying. I wish you were here. I wish you were. I wish you were here. I wish you were here. I wish you were here. Wish you were here"
