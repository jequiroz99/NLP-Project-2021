dust and bones,"We've been poisoned. tracked down, herded. to stand behind the mind,. of one man and his lies.. He's taken children,. armed them, served them. with orders from a desk. to spill their blood and risk their necks.. Sunrise, bad news. more dead, more wounds. the reasons are not clear. as to what we're doing here. You sit there dressed in. your posh suit and tie pin. you're 18 holes from home. away from all the dust and bones. And I hope we're walking out of here alive. Hope we're walking out alive..

new year's day,"The needle's in hand,. but I cannot sew.. My heart's a worn thing. like a sweater with holes.. It all fades. New year's day.. The rain creeps in. through the crack in the door,. like the guilt that seeps. from my head to the floor.. We'll all wait for.... New year's day, I'll wake up. in the same familiar way.. Where I end, we'll begin. we'll do it all over again.. 'Cause it's just another year that slipped away. from me. There's a place that kills. with walls that I know. I've got a coffin to sleep in,. it's not a bed but a hole.. This face in the mirror. just won't go away,. it hides in the room. stares me right in the face.. And it all fades.... New year's day, I'll wake up. in the same familiar way.. Where I end, we'll begin. we'll do it all over again. and it's just another year that slipped away. it's just another year that slipped away. it's just another year that slipped away. it's just another year that slipped.... On new year's day, I'll wake up. in the same familiar way. where I end, we'll begin. we'll do it all over again.. 'Cause it's just another year that slipped away. from me."
perfect sometimes,I catch every whisper. Surrounding your head. You got the look. of a poor girl wondering. Where she will sleep tonight. Am I a fool to let you in. You said it would all work out. and everything will be the same. Someday soon. I followed willing just staring at your heels. As I walk towards the grave mistake. And am I a fool to let you. Sometime were blind and stupid. Sometimes we need to find out for ourselves. We all get carried away. Sally never had a night like this. Now shes dangling one foot off a cliff. Saying bet I could beat you down. Shes crouched behind her bedroom door. Making phone calls that her friends ignore. Wondering why the world let her down. And am I a fool to let you.. Sometimes were blind and stupid. Sometimes we need to find out for ourselves. Were just young and anxious. We all get carried away. Cause perfect is just not who we are. perfect is just not who we are. Sometimes were blind and stupid. Sometimes we need to find out for ourselves. We all get carried away sometimes
relentless,"Get off of work, come home,. pass out.. My life's become this cancer,. that's crawling through my skin. and after me.. I can't give up, I wont let down.. And though it seems relentless,. I can be relentless too.. Now you're better than you think you are,. show these people what you were born to do.. 'Cause I believe in you. I'd bet my life on you.. Forget the awful words they said. lost your dream, they lost their heads.. It's funny what fear does to you.. I cant seem to escape,. my days have become nightmares. and dreams of running away.. I can't give up, I wont let down.. And though it seems relentless,. I can be relentless too.. Now you're better than you think you are,. show these people what you were born to do.. 'Cause I believe in you. I'd bet my life on you.. Forget the awful words they said. lost your dream, they lost their heads.. It's funny what fear does to you.. Ooh, and I bet you'll find. this noose was.... and I'll bet you'll find. it was too tight.. Not yet, not yet.. Now you're better than you think you are,. show these people what you were born to do.. 'Cause I believe in you. I'd bet my life on you.. Forget the awful words they said. lost your dream,. they lost their heads. It's funny what fear does to you."
she had to leave,"You tried but you lost. and your ship sank just as fast as. it took for the ink to dry.. Well now your hope had failed,. you were relying on that medicine. but the pills that couldn't stand. the silence becomes the gasp for air. that you've been waiting for for so long. she just had to leave. couldn't wait to go to sleep. she couldn't dream. she couldn't breathe. won't we take it back home. she had to leave. she plays her rich cards well. but each line beneath her eyes has got a story to tell. now she's loading up. tunes her pulse to her song saying. ""when the song's done, you'll all be dead wrong"". and the silence becomes the gasp for air. she's been waiting for for so long.. she just had to leave. couldn't wait to go to sleep. she couldn't dream. she couldn't breathe. won't we take it back home. she had to leave. she just had to leave. couldn't wait to go to sleep. she couldn't dream. she couldn't breathe. won't we take it back home. she had to leave."
the crows came in,"The crows came in,. To watch us die,. Pretending to be friends of mine,. And I don?t think I like them anymore.. The clock goes off,. It?s close to 8.. I?m waking up alone today.. And I don?t think I like this anymore.. She said, ?Baby, you know,. Our seams are starting to show (?),. But if you wash your hands of me,. Things will never be the way they?re supposed to be.?. So we drove off, to New Orleans,. To paint their wreck with the songs we?d sing,. For nothing more than payment with a smile.. And the clock goes off,. It?s close to 8,. And she?s waking up alone today.. And I don?t think she likes me anymore.. And I said, ?Baby, you know,. You shoulda walked out long ago.. But if you wash your hands of me,. Well things will never be the way they?re supposed to. be.?. And I said, ?Baby you know,. The seams are starting to show.. But if you wash your hands of me,. Things will never be the way,. No, they?ll never be the way,. Oh, they?ll never be the way they?re supposed to be.?"
the paper face,"Ooh... look what you've started. so fess up, just fess up.. Ooh... is this what you wanted?. so fess up, just fess up.. Saw you got the part. as the villain in the masquerade..
