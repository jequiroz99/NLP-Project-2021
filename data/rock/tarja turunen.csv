Before the weight that pulled you under. Dared you to rise. Where are you now?. Are you proud of the life you wasted?. Wearing the crown of illusion you created. You'll never know what it feels like to shine. You're the master in your own mind. But a slave to all. You are a dark star. Empty. Is never enough. You keep clawing for what you can't reach. Smothering space filled without any grace and I can't breathe. Nothing lasts forever. Even the stars will loose their luster returning to dust. Where are you now?. Are you proud of the life you wasted?. Wearing the crown of illusion you created. You'll never know what it feels like to shine. You're the master in your own mind. But a slave to all. You are a dark star
darkness,"I'm scared of swimming in the sea. Dark shapes moving under me. Every fear I swallow makes me small. Inconsequential things occur. Alarms are triggered. Memories stir. It's not the way it has to be. I'm afraid of what I do not know. I hate being undermined. I'm afraid I can be devil man. And I'm scared to be divine. Don't mess with me my fuse is short. Beneath this skin these fragments caught. When I allow it to be. There's no control over me. I have my fears. But they do not have me. Walking through the undergrowth. To the house in the woods. The deeper I go, the darker it gets. I peer through the window. Knock at the door. And the monster I was, so afraid of. Lies curled up on the floor. Is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy. I cry until I laugh. I'm afraid of being mothered. With my balls shut in the pen. I'm afraid of loving women. And I'm scared of loving men. Flashbacks coming in every night. Don't tell me everything's alright. When I allow it to be. It has no control over me. I own my fear. So it doesn't own me. Walking through the undergrowth. To the house in the woods. The deeper I go, the darker it gets. I peer through the window. Knock at the door. And the monster I was, so afraid of. Lies curled up on the floor. Is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy. I cry until I laugh"

The darkest thoughts. The deepest sea. Where sun and moon arise. It's me. Chaos and isolation. Your only truth. What we can hear no one can understand. Madness. In desperation. A burst of anger.

falling awake (feat. joe satriani),"Phantom voices with no words to follow. At the mercy of the cold and hollow. I withdrew into my sanctuary of silence. My defence.

Is the dying memory. And now I can dive for. These dreams I make. Like I am Falling. I am falling awake. Waves of melodies once forgotten. Like a symphony across the ocean.

Flies away, far away. Break the cage. Run against the flames. Distrust and bitterness. It dies today. Lose your rage, save what still remains. Despair and loneliness. Why you love to hate?. Washed the pain. Time in vain. Thinking of tomorrow. Dust of shame. No more rain. Brush away my sorrow"

naiad,She hears the distant soft caress. There in the gloom. Colours surround with tenderness. Guiding her through. In the forgotten sweet abyss. Another sound. Twilight floating memories always without. Gloaming there above the surface. An illusion reaching down for me. What lies beneath. Beyond the ocean's door. Tranquil is the kiss of the azure rising deep. Sleeping ever more. Naiad's mystery. What lies beneath. Guarding their immortality. Saints in the sand. Stranger than beautiful eerie. An ancient land. Circle of 16 turned to stone and still they keep shimmering crystal promises. One space between. Gloaming there above the surface. An illusion reaching down for me. What lies beneath. Beyond the ocean's door. Tranquil is the kiss of the azure rising deep. Sleeping ever more. Naiad's mystery. What lies beneath. Beyond the ocean's door. Tranquil is the kiss of the azure rising deep. Sleeping ever more. Naiad's mystery. What lies beneath. Aah.... Breathing the newborn waves. Kneeling for the sea she became

Forever still yourself. The one that you defend. No bitter end"

You have a prayer on your lips under the desert sun. And a loaded gun. You remember every word. That your father said. Stay out of trouble son. And be true to yourself. You’ll be working like a dog. Raise a family. And life will be alright. But now it’s written in the stars if you’ll make it out alive. Out alive. The good die young. There might be no tomorrow. In god we trust. Through all this pain and sorrow. The good die young. The flame will burn forever. And no one knows your name. Bring the boys back home again. It was a quiet day. On the streets of hope. When the bomb went off. At the side of the road. Sounds of breaking steel. An windshield full of blood. No enemy in sight. It feels like in a movie scenes are passing by. It’s your life

I'll wait until the tears are gone. Goodbye. I know this love will go on. Until the silence says goodbye. Goodbye. I know our love will go on. Till silence says goodbye

walking in the air,We're walking in the air. We're floating in the moonlit sky. The people far below are sleeping as we fly. I'm holding very tight. I'm riding in the midnight blue. I'm finding I can fly so high above with you. Far across the wold. The villages go by like trees. The rivers and the hills. The forests and the streams. Children gaze open mouth. Taken by surprise. Nobody down below believes their eyes. We're surffing in the air. We're swimming in the frozen sky. We're drifting over icy. Mountain floating by. Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep. Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep. We're walking in the air. We're floating in the midnight sky. And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly
walking with the angels,"Sometimes the wonder or I am not afraid. Or understanding then all this heavy rain. And they wonder, yes they wonder. Yeah, they do. Sometimes they wonder if I will never break. For these burnings and all this heavy pain. And they wonder, yes they wonder. What I told. There is a power not from this world. I've found the power, a higher power. I'm walking with the angel. ""Walking with the angel"". I'm talking with the angel too. I'm walking with the angels. ""Walking with the angels"". And they pull me through the darkness too. I've been traveling the dark and deadly road. Sometimes so lonely, but never really alone. No wonder. I've been under the wings of a godless soul. I turn the secrets that I found out for sure. I wanna show you this heaven's guidance too. Don't wonder, no, no wonder. I can prove you that is true. There is a power not from this world. I've found the power, a higher power. I'm walking with the angels. "" Walking with the angels"". I'm talking with the angel too. I'm walking with the angels. "" Walking with the angels"".

I'm talking with the angels. I'm talking with an angel. And they're watching over me and you. And ""I'm talking with the angels "". I'm talking with the angels. I'm walking with the angels.

we are,How cold is the heart. My world is on fire. How deep is the mark. When you leave and your dream turn to water. I let myself feel. I'm wishing for something real. We are. We are. Chasing a shadow. We are. We are. Lost in the shame. You try to hide only to reach out. It's too late. With a smile you move on. Every fear left unspoken. There was hope. Now it's gone. So believe there is love in the open. You just have to let go and turn into something real. We are. We are. Chasing a shadow. We are. We are. Lost in the shame. You try to hide only to reach out. It's too late. Break the shade. See your hate. Black flames. No names. Who are you?. Janette said.. We are. We are. Chasing a shadow. We are. We are. Lost in the shame. You try to hide only to reach out. It's too late
we three kings,"We three kings of Orient are. Bearing gifts we traverse afar. Field and fountain, moor and mountain. Following yonder star. Born a King on Bethlehem's plain. Gold I bring to crown Him again. King forever, ceasing never. Over us all to reign. O star of wonder, star of night. Star with royal beauty bright. Westward leading, still proceeding. Guide us to thy perfect light. Frankincense to offer have I. Incense owns a Deity nigh. Prayer and praising, all men raising. Worship Him, God most high. O star of wonder, star of night. Star with royal beauty bright. Westward leading, still proceeding. Guide us to thy perfect light. O star of wonder, star of night. Star with royal beauty bright. Westward leading, still proceeding.

what child is this,"What child is this, who, laid to rest. On Mary's lap is sleeping. Whom angels greet with anthem sweet. While shepherds watch are keeping. This, this is Christ the King. Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. Haste, haste, to bring Him laud. The Babe, the Son of Mary. So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh. Come, peasant, kin to own Him. The King of kings salvation brings. Let loving hearts enthrone Him. This, this is Christ the King. Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. Haste, haste, to bring Him laud. The Babe, the Son of Mary.

Oh joy, oh joy for Christ is born. The Babe, the Son of Mary"
where were you last night / heaven is a place on earth / livin' on a prayer,"Still spinning round in my head. How I regret everything that I said. Why did I tell you to go?. Saving my pride but losing my soul. I'm here all alone. Still wait by the phone. The hours go by. What else could I do but to cry?. I call and I call. Just to make things right. Have I lost the fight?. Where were you last night?. I beg and I cry. I keep asking why. Where were you last night?. Where were you last night?. Lost in the dark and my fears. If only you saw the tracks of my tears. I think I'm losing my mind. Where did you go and what did you find?. I call and I call. Just to make things right. Have I lost the fight?. Where were you last night?. I beg and I cry. I keep asking why. Where were you last night?. Where were you last night?. I call and I call. Just to make things right. Have I lost the fight?. Where were you last night?. Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?. Ooh heaven is a place on earth. They say in heaven love comes first. We'll make heaven a place on earth. Ooh heaven is a place on earth. Livin' on a prayer. I'm here all alone. Still wait by the phone. The hours go by. What else could I do but to cry?. I call and I call. Just to make things right. Have I lost the fight?. Where were you last night?. I beg and I cry. OOh, we're halfway there. Whoa, livin' on a prayer. Take my hand, we'll make it I swear. Whoa, livin' on a prayer. OOh, we're halfway there. Whoa, livin' on a prayer. Take my hand, we'll make it I swear. Where were you last night?. Where were you last night?"
wisdom of wind,"Blue skies, rivers of gold. bring to my heart. the stories of old. I remember the way to begin. Led by all my grace. and a brave hand of peace. The air will lift us. our hearts a gift as. we feel the release. The breaking of dawn. I see the wind and the breeze. will carry us home. joining us all in unified love. The sweetness of peace. more precious than gold. the tender compassion. that gives elation as we behold.

witch-hunt,"You seek to blame. Condemn the name. Bewitch the masses with your own veil. Without remorse. you seek the ones. trespassing lines you don't understand. I am the door to the unknown. I hear the whispering souls around. My eyes can see your fear of me. I am not wondering why you're here. No more pain. Wronged again and again. Pride will fall like sounds of misery. In the lips that have been hurt. Still today as before. Write your sins to her core. My gruesome fate. Axe, rope, or flame. Put me to death. I'll be born again. No more pain. Wronged again and again. Pride will fall like sounds of misery. In the lips that have been hurt. Still today as before. Write your sins to her core"
you would have loved this,"The winter left her blanket. here this morning. A soft and gentle coverlet of white. Unfolded in the shadows of the dawn. It Sparked in the early morning light. You would have loved this. You would have loved this. This was your favorite time of day. The greenery is laid across the mantle. And ornaments are hanging on the tree. And cradled in the windowsill's a candle. A beacon in the night. to call you back to me. You would have loved this. You always loved this. I know you loved this time of year. And though I understand. One day again I'll see you. I long to touch your hand,. hear your voice, feel you. You would have loved this. You always loved this. Oh, how you loved."
your heaven and your hell (feat. michael monroe),"Give the devil your little finger. He'll take your whole hand. Wanna stay in bed. Got a heavy head. A sledge-hammer in my skull. But I'm scared I'd wind up dead. If life should get too dull. Well, maybe there ain't no divine plan. And things just happen cause they can. Just don't paint devils on the wall. Ain't nothing cool about death at all. Love and Light are heaven-sent. We really ain't all that hellbent. On darkness our style. We'd rather make you smile. Killing them with kindness all the while. Why on Earth you wanna blame God. When things don't go your way?. It's just the evil that men do down here everyday. Take responsibility for your actions and your liberty. Can't neglect cause and effect with your apathy. The second coming came and went. Third-time lucky heaven-sent. It ain't no shuck n' jive. You control your life. You don't need the trouble or the strife. If there's a god we know him well. If there's a devil we can tell. There ain't no punishment in hell. Sin is only man's invention. It ain't no divine intervention. You make your own Heaven and your Hell. If there's a god we know him well. If there's a devil we can tell. There ain't no punishment in hell. You don't get saved by the bell. If there's a god we know him well. If there's a devil we can tell. There ain't no punishment in hell. Sin is only man's invention. It ain't no divine intervention. You make your own Heaven and your Hell"
