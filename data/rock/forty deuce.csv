complicated,"by Richie Kotzen, Taka & Ari. Just around midnight the stars light my way. I walk with my feet off the ground. I go to a place that my head has never been. Somehow it’s pulling me down. Automatic voices in my head. Am I living, am I dead?. It gets so complicated in my mind. And I don’t know why. It gets so complicated all the time. No matter how hard I try. I try to fight my way out of this place. Theses empty streets turn me down. You say the truth right in front of my face. But that won’t turn me around. Automatic voices in my head. Am I living, am I dead?. It gets so complicated in my mind. And I don’t know why. It gets so complicated all the time. No matter how hard I try. I can’t fake it, I'm not changing, I am wasted.... Complicated"
heaven,"by Richie Kotzen, Taka & Ari. I could be the answer to the questions that you ask in your mind. I could be the reason why you feel what you feel in your heart. I will give you time tell me what you wanna fell. You should know my kind. I ain’t no angel one look in my eyes. and you know: this ain’t heaven. I will give you happiness I’ll tell you lies. but you know this ain’t heaven. You may think the sun will rise and change my point of view. but you're wrong. You can paint a picture of your perfect kind of life when I'm gone. When I'm gone. I ain’t no angel one look in my eyes. and you know: this ain’t heaven. I will give you happiness I’ll tell you lies. but you know this ain’t heaven. I will give you time. Tell me what you wanna feel. You should know my kind. I ain’t no angel one look in my eyes. and you know: this ain’t heaven. Ill give you happiness I’ll tell you lies. but you know this ain’t heaven"
i still,"Don’t try to make me what I don’t wanna be. This is my life and I will do what I please. You say my fate is hopeless,. You say I have no focus. The more I suffocate the more I can see. My bedroom walls are closing on me. As my life passes before me. I know I am living but this life ain’t for me. And I still forever wanna get away. And I will show you that you are wrong. And I still believe there's another way. And I will show you that you are wrong. You know that I will. You come to me with all your visions of hope. You say I let you down so leave me alone. You got your hands on my neck. My strength is more than you expect. The more I suffocate the more I am free. The more I suffocate the more I can see. My bedroom walls are closing on me. As my life passes before me. I know I am living but this life ain’t for me. And I still forever wanna get away. And I will show you that you are wrong. And I still believe there's another way. And I will show you that you are wrong. You know that I will"
next to me,"Conversations all the same. I ain’t gonna play no fuking games. Deep inside I wanna change. But I know I’ll always walk away. If I tell you everything, will you tell me what you fear?. When I tell you what I feel, will you tell me what is real?. I’m nothing that you’ve seen before. I am free, I'm gonna be all that you see. When you wake up next to me. And when you dream who will you be, when you wake up next to me?. Smoking drinking gasoline I am everything you want to me. Got nine lives I have wasted five. but I know that time is on my side. If I tell you everything, will you tell me what you fear?. When I tell you what I feel, will you tell me what is real?. I’m nothing that you’ve seen before. I am free, I'm gonna be all that you see. When you wake up next to me. And when you dream who will you be, when you wake up next to me?"
nothing to lose,"You're the one in my mind. And you walk through my dreams. And as strange as it seems, you will never be a stranger to me.. I will abandon all the answers. that I kept in my back pocket. So give up your convictions. and follow your heart for one night. Try to cancel you fear, forget why all you hear. You know that this time, there's nothing to lose. Moving too fast. Are you stuck in the past?. No, you don't have to ask. 'Cause you'll always be the answer to me. I will abandon all the answers. that I kept in my back pocket. So give up your convictions. and follow your heart for one night. Try to cancel you fear, forget why all you hear. You know that this time, there's nothing to lose. Open your mind and show me the truth. Look in my eyes, there's nothing to lose. Nothing to lose. So you've tried before. Now try again. I'm asking you to let me in. Ooh, nothing to lose. I will abandon all the answers. I kept'em in my back pocket. So give up your convictions. and follow your heart for one night. Try to cancel you fear, forget why all you hear. You know that this time, there's nothing to lose. Open your mind and show me the truth. Look in my eyes, there's nothing to lose. Nothing to lose"
oh my god,"I'm facing all of my regrets. I'm taking all that I can get. It's right in front of me, but I don't wanna see. I guess I'll never understand it. It never goes how I planned it. I'm not afraid of taking chances. How come I'm shit out of luck?. Oh my God I fucked up again!. My whole life is the same mistake. and I try and I try to find my way out. but I know that I'll fuck up again. I am the habit that I can break. And I don't know another way. Should I be satisfied with what I leave behind?. I guess I'll never understand it. It never goes how I planned. I'm not afraid of taking chances. How come I'm a shit out of luck?. Oh my God I fucked up again!. My whole life is the same mistake. and I try and I try to find my way out. but I know that I'll fuck up again. Maybe I need a second chance.... Or maybe this is who I am. I guess I'll never understand it. It never goes how I planned. I'm not afraid of taking chances. How come I'm a shit out of luck?. Oh my God I fucked up again!. My whole life is one mistake. and I try and I try to find my way out. but I know that I'll fuck up again"
say,"It's all the little things. It's everything you are. and you're gone, it makes me crazy. You're sticking to my heart and I am out of mind. I wan't to know your pulse is racing. I think I like it, I think I need it. I know you're everything I want. You know you're everything I need. I think I like it, I think I need it. Say you want me, say you need me. Say I'm what you're looking for. Say you love me, say you leave me. Make me want you even more. I wanna feel, I wanna feel like I've never felt before. I wanna know, I wanna know, tell me what I'm looking for. When you're all alone, do you think of me?. Is it real or are we faking?. I watch you come and go. I know you're somewhere else. I can watch but I can't chase it. I think I like it, I think I need it. I know you're everything I want. You know you're everything to me. I think I like it, I think I need it.

stand up,"Nobody said that it was easy. Nobody said that this is how it should be. I wanna be, I wanna dream, I wanna see what we are missing. Every step you take, I'll walk you through it. Every when you breake, I put it back together. If they wanna throw you to the ground. If they try to kick you when your down. Even if there's no one else around. I'll stand up, stand up for you. Always you and me, never gonna stop what we believe. Even if the world is on its knees I will sand up. I'll stand up, stand up for you. I know your past has made you cautions. You know our future is more that you can see. But I believe, I believe we can kick the door wide open. Every step you take, I'm walking through it. Even when you breake, I put it back together. If they wanna throw you to the ground. If they try to kick you when your down. Even if there’s no one else around. I will sand up I will stand up for you. Always you and me never gonna stop what we believe. Even if the world is on it’s knees I will sand up. I will stand up for you. We can turn this thing all around. We can make it with the hand untight. I'll stand up, stand up.. If they wanna throw you to the ground. If they try to kick you when your down. Even if there’s no one else around. I will sand up I will stand up for you. Always you and me never gonna stop what we believe. Even if the world is on it’s knees I will sand up. I will stand up for you.

standing in the rain,You gave me your word and then walked away. And i tried to play along. You're such a tragic lust fantasy. And you keep me hanging on. Killing all my enemies in the end it's you and me. You're acting like you're scared of me. You know i'm not the enemy. Standing in the rain by myself got me suicidal. And i wonder where did i go wrong. Standing in the rain. I know i am lying to myself and still i wonder. Where did i go wrong?. You got me tangled in your web. And i'll never get away. I still remember what you said. Do you remember what you said?. Killing all my enemies. In the end it's you and me. You are acting like your scared of me. You know i am not the enemy. (time for us to get away)
start it up,"I do a little bit and try to quit but damage done. I'm too far gone. I’m doing everything I wanna do. So how you gonna tell me it’s wrong?. From the tip of my toes to the rush sent to my head. It’s a feeling I know I’ll never feel again. Start it up, start it up start it up let it go. Start it up, start it up till your body says no!. Start it up, start it up start it up let it go. Start it up, start it up till your body says no!. I am unaffected for a second but the second goes on too long. I feel neglected and rejected but then suddenly I fell so strong. And I can’t get away from myself long enough to be saved. So I take what you give and you tell me I am ok. Start it up, start it up start it up let it go. Start it up, start it up till your body says no!. Start it up, start it up start it up let it go. Start it up, start it up till your body says no!. So I take what you give and you tell me I am ok. Start it up, start it up start it up let it go. Start it up, start it up till your body says no!. Start it up, start it up start it up let it go. Start it up, start it up till your body says no!"
wanted,"I pick up the telephone and I hear about all that you have done. I turn on my television and see what you have become. I could say that I'm happy for you, but I. I wanna know.... How does it feel when you're wanted?. Do you fight it all that let it go to your head?. How does it feel when you're famous?. Is it happiness or isn't it in your head?. I look at theses broken pieces. And feel the distance between us. I've got all our old pictures, they are faded. But they still have meaning. How can you forget your past so easy?. I remember mine.... How does it feel when you're wanted?. Do you fight it all that echo to your head?. How does it feel when you're famous?. Is it happiness or is it in your head?. Do you remember our first trip to LA?. Do you remember the things we used to say?. It seems to me that you're happier alone. How does it feel when you're wanted?. Do you fight it all that echo to your head?. How does it feel when you're famous?. Is it happiness or is it in your head?. Oh, you're wanted, tell me how it feels.. Oh, you're wanted, I wanna know.... Oh, you're so wanted, tell me how it feels."
