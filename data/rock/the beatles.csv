With lovers and friends I still can recall. Some are dead and some are living. In my life I've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers. There is no one compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning. When I think of love as something new. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life I'll love you more. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things that went before.

lucy in the sky with diamonds,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river. With tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly. A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green. Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes. And she's gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain. Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies. Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers. That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore. Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds. And you're gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Picture yourself on a train in a station. With plasticine porters with looking glass ties. Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile. The girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Lucy in the sky with diamonds"

Goode,. Who never ever learned to read or write so well. But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.. (Chorus). Go Go. Go Johnny Go Go (x4). Johnny B. Goode. He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,. Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track. Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,. Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,. People passin' by they would stop and say. ""Oh my but that little country boy can play"". (Chorus). His momma told him ""some day you will be a man,. And you will be the leader of a big ol' band. Many people comin' from miles around,. To hear you play your music till the sun go down,. Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin. 'Johnny B. Goode' tonight"". (Chorus)"

the ballad of john and yoko,"Standing in the deck at southhampton. Trying to get holland or france. The man in the mac said, ""you've got to go back"". You know they didn't even give us a chance. Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be. The way things are going they're going to crucify me. Finally made the plane into paris. Honeymooning down by the seine. Peter brown called to say,""you can make it ok,. You can get married in gibraltar near spain"". Drove from paris to the amsterdam hilton. Talking in our beds for a week. The newspaper said ""say what're you doin' in bed?"". I said ""we only try to get us some peace"". Saving up your money for a rainy day. Giving all your clothes to the charity. Last night the wife said ""oh,boy when you're dead,. You don't take nothing with you, but your soul, think!"". Made a lightning trip to vienna. Eating chocolate cake in a bag. The newspaper said ""she's gone to his head,. They look just like 2 gurus in drag"". Caught the early plane back to london. Fifty acorns tied in a sack. The men from the press said "" we wish you success,. It's good to have the both of you back"""

while my guitar gently weeps,I look at you all. See the love there that's sleeping. While my guitar gently weeps. I look at the floor. And I see it needs sweeping. Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know why nobody told you. How to unfold your love. I don't know how someone controlled you. They bought and sold you. I look at the world. And I notice it's turning. While my guitar gently weeps. With every mistake. We must surely be learning. Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know how you were diverted. You were perverted too. I don't know how you were inverted. No one alerted you. I look from the wings. at the play you are staging. While my guitar gently weeps. As I'm sitting here. doing nothing but aging. Still my guitar gently weeps. . I look at you all. See the love there that's sleeping. While my guitar gently weeps. I look at you all. Still my guitar gently weeps

within you without you,"""we were talking.... About the space between us all. And the people. Who hide themselves behind a wall. Of illusion. Never glimpse the truth. Then it's far too late.... When they pass away...... We were talking. about the love we all could share. When we find it.... To try our best to hold it there. (with our love). With our love we could save the world,. If they only knew........ Try to realise it's all within yourself. No one else can make you change,. And to see you're really only very small. And life flows on within you. And without you.. We were talking. About the love that's gone so cold. And the people. Who gain the world and lose their soul. They dont know. They can't see... Are you one of them?.... When you've seen beyond yourself. Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there. And the time will come when you see. We're all one. and life flows on within you and without you."""
