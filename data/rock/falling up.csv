"goddess of the dayspring, am i","I have found. Gears under the water. Crossed the streets of Acheron. To the docks that tilted up. Towards the lines. And now I'm. In and out of sleep.

Crossed the wandering walls to find. None of there wars!. Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?. Still I run my hands over your dress. Some of us have seen. The Golden Arrows poised. Arc across the courts. Turns us pale. Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?. Still I run my hands over your dress. And our character will never forget what has happened to that city,.

Ticking like a time bomb, ticking like a time bomb. I landed here to breathe. I landed here to breathe. But I never felt this strange. Await for an inlay to monitor.
