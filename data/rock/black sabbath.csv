iron man,"I am iron man!. Has he lost his mind?. Can he see or is he blind?. Can he walk at all,. Or if he moves will he fall?. Is he alive or dead?. Has he thoughts within his head?. We'll just pass him there. Why should we even care?. He was turned to steel. In the great magnetic field. When he travelled time. For the future of mankind. Nobody wants him. He just stares at the world. Planning his vengeance. That he will soon unfurl. Now the time is here. For iron man to spread fear. Vengeance from the grave. Kills the people he once saved. Nobody wants him. They just turn their heads. Nobody helps him. Now he has his revenge. Heavy boots of lead. Fills his victims full of dread. Running as fast as they can. Iron man lives again!"
paranoid,"Finished with my woman. Cause she couldn't help me with my mind. People think I'm insane because. I am frowning all the time. All day long I think of things. But nothing seems to satisfy. Think I'll lose my mind if. I don't find something to pacify. Can you help me? Occupy my brain ?. Oh yeah. I need someone to show me. The things in life that I can't find. I can't see the things that make true happiness,. I must be blind. Make a joke and I will sigh. And you will laugh and I will cry. Happiness I cannot feel. And love to me is so unreal. And so as you hear these words. Telling you now all of my state. I tell you to enjoy life. I wish I could but it's too late"
black sabbath,"What is this that stands before me?. Figure in black which points at me. Turn around quick, and start to run. Find out I'm the chosen one - Oh no!. Big black shape with eyes of fire. Telling people their desire. Satan's sitting there, he's smiling. Watch those flames get higher and higher. Oh no, no, please God help me!. Child cries out for his mother. Mother's screaming in the fire. Satan points at me again. Opens the door to push me in. Oh No!. This is the end my friend. Satan's coming 'round the bend. people running 'cause they're scared. You people better go and beware!. No! No! Please! No!"
n.i.b.,"Some people say my love cannot be true. Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you. I will give you those things you thought unreal. The sun, the moon, the stars; all bear my seal. Oh yeah!. Follow me now and you will not regret. Leaving the life you led before we met. You are the first to have this love of mine. Forever with me 'til the end of time. Your love for me has just got to be real. Before you know the way I'm going to feel. I'm going to feel. I'm going to feel. Oh yeah!. Now I have you with me, under my power. Our love grows stronger now with every hour. Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am. My name is Lucifer, please take my hand. Oh yeah!. Follow me now and you will not regret. Leaving the life you led before we met. You are the first to have this love of mine. Forever with me 'til the end of time. Your love for me has just got to be real. Before you know the way I'm going to feel. I'm going to feel. I'm going to feel. Oh yeah!. Now I have you with me, under my power. Our love grows stronger now with every hour.

changes,"I feel unhappy, I feel so sad. I've lost the best friend, that I ever had.. She was my woman, I love her so.. But it's too late now, I've let her go.. I'm going through changes.. I'm going through changes.. We shared the years, we shared each day.. In love together, we found a way.. But soon the world, had its evil way.. My heart was blinded, love went astray.. I'm going through changes.. I'm going through changes.. It took so long, to realize.. And I can still hear her last goodbyes.. Now all my days, are filled with tears.. Wish I could go back, and change these years.. I'm going through changes.. I'm going through changes."
war pigs,"Generals gathered in their masses. Just like witches at black masses. Evil minds that plot destruction. Sorcerers of death's construction. In the fields the bodies burning. As the war machine keeps turning. Death and hatred to mankind. Poisoning their brainwashed minds, oh lord yeah!. Politicians hide themselves away. They only started the war. Why should they go out to fight?. They leave that role to the poor. Time will tell on their power minds. Making war just for fun. Treating people just like pawns in chess. Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah!. Now in darkness, world stops turning. Ashes where their bodies burning. No more war pigs at the power. Hand of god has struck the hour. Day of judgement, god is calling. On their knees, the war pigs crawling. Begging mercy for their sins. Satan, laughing, spreads his wings. Oh lord, yeah!"
heaven and hell,"Sing me a song, you're a singer. Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil. The devil is never a maker. The less that you give, you're a taker. So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell. Oh well. The lover of life's not a sinner. The ending is just a beginner. The closer you get to the meaning. The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming. So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on. It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell. I can tell. Fool, fool. Oh uh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion. For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life. Love can be seen as the answer,. but nobody bleeds for the dancer. And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on.... They say that life's a carousel. Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well. The world is full of kings and queens. Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams. It's heaven and hell, oh well. And they'll tell you black is really white. The moon is just the sun at night. And when you walk in golden halls. You get to keep the gold that falls. It's heaven and hell, oh no. Fool, fool. You've got to bleed for the dancer. Fool, fool. Look for the answer. Fool, fool, fool"
sabbath bloody sabbath,"You see right through distorted eyes. You know you have to learn. The execution of your mind. You really have to turn. The race is run, the book is read. The end begins to show. The truth is out, the lies are old. But you don't want to know. Nobody will ever let you know. When you ask the reasons why. They just tell you that you're on your own. Fill your head all full of lies-lies-lies-lies-lies. The people who have crippled you. You want to see them burn. The gates of life have closed on you. And there's just no return. You're wishing that the hands of doom. Would take your mind away. And you don't care if you don't see. Again the light of day. Nobody will ever let you know. When you ask the reasons why. They just tell you that you're on your own. Fill your head all full of lies-lies-lies-lies-lies. You bastards!. Where can you run to?. What more can you do?. No more tomorrow. Life is killing you. Dreams turn to nightmares. Heaven turns to Hell. Burns out confusion. Nothing more to tell, yeah. Everything around you. What's it coming to?. God knows as your dog knows. Bog blast all of you. Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. Nothing more to do. Living just for dying. Dying just for you, yeah...."
the wizard,"Misty morning, clouds in the sky. Without warning, a wizard walks by. Casting his shadow, weaving his spell. Funny clothes, trinkling bell. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic. Evil power disappears. Demons worry when the wizard is near. He turns tears into joy. Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic. Sun is shining, clouds have gone by. All the people give a happy sigh. He has passed by, giving his sign. Left all the people feeling so fine. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic"
children of the sea,"In the misty morning, on the edge of time. We've lost the rising sun, a final sign. As the misty morning rolls away to die. reaching for the stars, we blind the sky. We sailed across the air before we learned to fly. We thought that it could never end. We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run. Now it seems our world has come undone. Oh they say that it's over. and it just had to be. ooh they say that it's over. we're lost children of the sea, oh. We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played. hiding in our corner of the world. Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore. threw away the key and locked the door. Oh they say that it's over, yeah. and it just had to be. yes they say that it's over. we're lost children of the sea. In the misty morning, on the edge of time. We've lost the rising sun, a final sign. As the misty morning rolls away to die. reaching for the stars, we blind the sky. Oh they say that it's over, yeah. and it just had to be. oh they say that it's over. poor lost children of the sea, yeah. LOOK OUT! the sky is falling down!. LOOK OUT! The world is spinning round and round and round!. LOOK OUT! The sun is going black, black. LOOK OUT! It's never never never coming back, LOOK OUT!."
children of the grave,Revolution in their minds. The children start to march. Against the world in which they have to live. and all the hate that's in their hearts. They're tired of being pushed around. And told just what to do. They'll fight the world until they've won. And love comes flowing through. Children of tomorrow live in. The tears that fall today. Will the sunrise of tomorrow. Bring them peace in any way. Must the world live. In the shadow of atomic fear. Can they win the fight for peace. Or will they disappear?. So you children of the world. Listen to what I say. If you want a better place to live in. Spread the words today. Show the world that love. Is still alive you must be brave. Or you children of today. Are children of the grave
sweet leaf,"Alright now!. Won't you listen?. When I first met you, didn't realize,. I can't forget you, or your surprise. You introduced me to my mind. And left me watching you and you kind.. Oh yeah. I love you. Oh, you know it.. My life was empty, forever on a down,. Until you took me, showed me around. My life is free now, my life is clear. I love you sweet leaf though you can't hear. Oh yeah!. Come on now - Try it out!. Straight people don't know what you're about,. They put you down and shut you out. You gave to me a new belief,. And soon the world will love you sweet leaf. Oh yeah baby!. Come on now! Oh yeah!. Try me out baby!. Alright! Oh yeah-ah!. I want you part of this sweet leaf!. Oh yeah!. Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh try me out. I love you sweet leaf, oh"
into the void,"Rocket engines burning fuel so fast. Up into the night sky they blast. Through the universe the engines whine. Could it be the end of man and time. Back on earth the flame of life burns low. Everywhere is misery and woe. Pollution kills the air, the land and sea. Man prepares to meet his destiny. Rocket engines burning fuel so fast. Up into the black sky so vast. Burning metal through the atmosphere. Earth remains in worry, hate and fear. With the hateful battles raging on. Rockets flying to the glowing sun. Through the empires of eternal void. Freedom from the final suicide. Freedom fighters sent out to the sun. Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution.. Leave the earth to all its sin and hate. Find another world where freedom waits.. Past the stars in fields of ancient void. Through the shields of darkness where they find. Love upon a land a world unknown. Where the sons of freedom make their home. Leave the earth to satan and his slaves. Leave them to their future in the grave. Make a home where love is there to stay. Peace and happiness in every day"
snowblind,"What you get and what you see. Things that don't come easily. Feeling happy in my vein. Icicles within my brain. (cocain). Something blowing in my head. Winter's ice, it soon will spread. Death would freeze my very soul. Makes me happy makes me cold. My eyes are blind but I can see. The snowflakes glistin on the tree. The sun no longer sets me free. I feel the snowflakes freezing me. Let the winter sun shine on. Let me feel the frost of dawn. Fill my dreams with flakes of snow. Soon I'll feel the chilling glow. Right!. Don't you think I know what I'm doing. Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong. You're the one who's really the loser. This is where I feel I belong. Crystal world with winter flowers. Turns my days to frozen hours. Lying snowblind in the sun. Will my ice age ever come"
god is dead?,"Lost in the darkness. I fade from the light. Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior. Help me make it through the night. Blood on my conscience. And murder in mind. Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom. Now my body is my shrine. The blood runs free. The rain turns red. Give me the wine. You keep the bread. The voices echo in my head. Is God alive or is God dead?. Is God dead?. Rivers of evil run through dying land. Swimming in sorrow. They kill, steal, and borrow. There is no tomorrow. For the sinners will be damned. Ashes to ashes you cannot exhume a soul. Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust. Leaves you empty and unwhole?. When will this nightmare be over? Tell me. When can I empty my head?. Will someone tell me the answer?. Is God really dead?. Is God really dead?. To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath. I transfer from reality into a living death. I empathize with enemies until the time is right. With God and satan at my side. From darkness will come light. I watch the rain as it turns red. Give me more wine. I don?t need bread. These riddles that live in my head. I don?t believe that God is dead. God is dead. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. Wondering if we will meet again on the other side. Do you believe a word what the good book said?. Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead?. God is dead. Right. But still the voices in my head are telling me that God is dead. The blood pours down. The rain turns red. I don?t believe that God is dead. God is dead"
warning,Now the first day that I met ya. I was looking in the sky. When the sun turned all a blur. And the thunderclouds rolled by. The sea began to shiver. And the wind began to moan. It must've been a sign for me. To leave you well alone. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. You never said you love me. And I don't believe you can. 'cause I saw you in a dream. And you were with another man. You looked so cool and casual. And I tried to look the same. But now i've got to know ya. Tell me who am I to blame?. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. Now the whole wide world is movin'. 'cause there's iron in my heart. I just can't keep from cryin'. 'cause you say we've got to part. Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone. And watch you slowly take away. A love i've never known. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. Just a lit bit to strong
never say die,"People going nowhere, taken for a ride. Looking for the answers that they know inside. Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme. Snow White's mirror said ""partners in crime! "". Don't they ever have to worry?. Don't you ever wonder why?. It's a part of me that tells you. Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die. Never, never, never say die again. Sunday's satisfaction. Monday's home and dry. Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie. All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go. Hold back, 'till it's ready, taking it slow. Don't they ever have to worry?. Don't you ever wonder why?. It's a part of me that tells you. Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die. Never, never, never say die again. Don't you ever say die. Don't you ever say die. Never say die. Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall. Children get together, you can save us all. Future's on the corner, throwing us a die. Slow down, turn around, everything's fine. There's no need to have a reason. There's no need to wonder why. It's a part of me that tells you. Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die. Never, never, never say die again. Never say die"
tomorrow's dream,Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak. catch the fastest train around nine. Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache. before it takes me away from my mind. Send me love and I may let you see me. Send me hopes that can spin in my head. But if you really want me to answer. I can only let you know when I'm dead. When sadness fills my days. It's time to turn away. and then tomorrow's dreams. become reality to me. So realize I'm much better without you. You're not the one and only thing in my heart. I'll just go back to pretending I'm living. so this time I'm gonna have to depart.
end of the beginning,"Is this the end of the beginning?. Or the beginning of the end?. Losing control or are you winning?. Is your life real or just pretend?. Reanimation of the sequence. Rewinds the future to the past. To find the source of the solution. The system has to be recast. Release your mind. Fast forward to the secrets of your code. Your life's on overload. Delete or save, the units that make you an entity. That's your identity. If you don't know. Which way to go. You may be lost and confused. A second chance. Your time to lose. Reanimation of your cyber sonic soul. Transforming time and space beyond control. Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate. Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too late. You don't want to be a robot ghost. Occupied inside a human host. Analyzed and cloned relentlessly. Synthesized until they set you free. Alright-okay, alright, till they set you free. Alright-okay, till they set you free. I don't see you. I don't wanna see you"
fairies wear boots,"Goin' home late last night. Suddenly I got a fright. Yeah, I looked through a window and suprise what I saw:. Fairy boots are dancin' with a dwarf. All right now!. Yeah, Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me. Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies. Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me. I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes. Ohh, right now!. Yeah, Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me. Yeah, I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies. Yeah, Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me. I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes. Allright now!. So I went to the doctor to see what he would give me. He said, ""Son, son, you've gone too far,. 'cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."". Yeahhhhhh!"

a national acrobat,I am the world that hides the universal. Secret of all time. Destruction of the empty spaces is my. One and only crime. I've lived a thousand times. I found out what it means to be believed. The thoughts and images. The unborn child who never was conceived. When little worlds collide. I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell. And flashing memories. Are cast into the never ending well. The name that scorns the face. The child that never sees the cause of man. The deathly darkness that. Belies the face of those who never ran. You gotta believe me. I'm talking to you. Well I know its hard for you to know the reason why. And I know you'll understand when it's time to die. Don't believe the life you have will be the only one. You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on. I want you to listen. I'm trying to get through. Love has given life to you and now its your concern. Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return. Still I look but not to touch. The seeds of life are sown. Curtain of the future falls. The secret stays unknown. Just remember love is life. And hate is living death. Treat your life for what its worth. And live for every breath. Looking back I've lived and learned. But now I'm wondering. Here I wait and only guess. What this next life will bring. Ha Ha!!
die young,"Yell to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all. your back's to the wall. Then chase the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,. you run, you run!. Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told:. you'll never get old. Life's fantasy - to be locked away and still to think you're free. you're free, we're free!. [Chorus]. So live for today. Tomorrow never comes. Die Young. Die young, die young. can't you see the writing on the wall?. Die young, gonna die young. someone stopped the pain. Yell to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all. your back's to the wall. Then chase the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,. you run, you run!. So live for today. Tomorrow never comes. Die young, young!. Die young, die young!. Die young, die young, young!. Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!!"
neon knights,"Oh no, here it comes again. can't remember when we came so close to love before. Hold on, good things never last. nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again. again and again and again. Cry out to legions of the brave. time again to save us from the jackals of the street. Ride out, protectors of the realm. captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights. Circles and rings, dragons and kings. weaving a charm and a spell. Blessed by the night, holy and bright. called by the toll of the bell. Bloodied angels fast descending. moving on a never-bending light. phantom figures free forever. out of shadows, shining ever-bright. Neon Knights!. Neon Knights! all right!. Cry out to legions of the brave. time again to save us from the jackals of the street. Ride out, protectors of the realm. captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights. again and again, again and again and again. Neon Knights!. Neon Knights!. all right!."
electric funeral,"Reflexes in the sky warn you you're gonna die. Storm coming, You'd better hide. from the atomic tide. Flashes in the sky. turns houses into sties. Turns people into clay,. Radiation minds decay. Robot minds of robot slaves. Lead them to atomic graves. Plastic flowers, melting sun,. fading moon falls upon. Dying world of radiation,. Victims of man's frustration. Burning glow of unseen fire,. like electric funeral pyre. Buildings crashing. down to the stoney ground. Rivers turn to wood,. ice melts into blood. Earth lies in death bed,. Clouds cry water dead. Tearing life away, here's the burning pay. Electric funeral. Electric funeral. Electric funeral. Electric funeral. And so in the sky shines the electric eye. Supernatural king takes earth under his wing. Heaven's golden chorus sings,. Hell's angels black their wings. Evil souls fall to hell,. Ever trapped in burning cells!"
a hard road,"Old men crying, young men dying. World still turns as Father Time looks on, on and on. Children playing, dreamers praying. Laughter turns to tear as love has gone, has it gone?. Oh, it's a hard road. Oh, it's a hard road. Whirlwind churning, lovers learning. On this path of life we can't back down, is it wrong?. Widows weeping, babies sleeping. Life becomes the singer and the song, sing along. Oh, it's a hard road. Carry your own load. Why make the hard road?. Why can't we be friends?. No need to hurry. We'll meet in the end. Why make the hard road?. Why can't we be friends?. No need to worry. Let's sing it again. Brother's sharing, mother's caring. Nightime falling victim to the dawn, shadows small. Days are crawling, time is calling. To the Earth that not that life has gone, love line drawn. Oh, it's a hard road. Carry your own load. Oh, it's a hard road. Oh, it's a hard road.... Forget all your sorrows, don't live in the past. And look to the future, `cos life goes too fast you know. Forget all your sorrows, don't live in the past. And look to the future, `cos life goes too fast you know. Forget all your sorrows, don't live in the past. And look to the future, `cos life goes too fast you know"

after all,What do you say to the dead. Will you forgive me for living. Can't believe the things that they said. Wonderful day for a killing. It's killing me. What do they do with your soul. Is it just lying there busted. When did you lose all control. Is there someone to be trusted. With my mind. Oh there's insufficient evidence. Of what just might come after. But sometimes out of nowhere. There's demented sounds of laughter. Are we all haunted by. The ghost - imagination. It just can't be. I've seen them there. Howling at the moon. Is it just me. Or does somebody else believe this. Well I'm not alone. And I'm not afraid. There's just one way to see. Chorus:. After all etc.. What do you say to the dead. Is there a place where it's burning. It says in a book I once read. Yes there's a chance of returning. Turn to me. The fundamental principles. Say nothing of forever. But those are voices that I hear. Or I'm just not so clever. It can't be me. I know somebody else believes this. Well I'm not alone. I'm not afraid. Just one way to see. After all etc..

after forever,"Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?. Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave. Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?. Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?. When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?. Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a fool?. Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways. And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days. Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say. If they knew you believe in God above?. They should realize before they criticize. that God is the only way to love. Is your mind so small that you have to fall. In with the pack wherever they run. Will you still sneer when death is near. And say they may as well worship the sun?. I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ. I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced. Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?. You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve. Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone. Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one. The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate. Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late.."

age of reason,"Do you hear the thunder, raging in the sky?. Premonition of a shattered world that's gonna die. In the age of reason, how do we survive?. The protocols of evil ravage through so many lives. So many lives. So many lives. Mystifying silence, talking peace on Earth. We should just join for ourselves, not what we're worth. Sustainable extinction, a fractured human race. A changing revolution. Disappears without a trace. Without a trace (x2). Alright yeah!. Always felt that there'd be trouble. Mass distraction hides the truth. Prozac days and sleepless hours. Seas of change that don't bear through. Oh yeah!. These times are heavy. And you're all alone. The battle's over, but the war goes on. Politics, religion, love of money too. It's what the world was built for. But not for me and you, oh yeah!"
air dance,"She sits in silence in her midnight world. Her faded pictures of her dancing girls. Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time. Her happy memories dancing through her mind. In days of romance. She was the queen of dance. She'd dance the night away. And as the seasons turn the days to years. She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers. The days grow lonely for the dancing queen. And now she dances only in her dreams. In days of romance. She was the queen of dance. She'd dance the night away, away, away, away"

all moving parts stand still,"Super animation, turning on a nation. And they're saying all moving parts stand still. Since he was elected, adrenalin injected. Hear him saying all moving parts should kill. Just like the hero he's got them all on the run,. Yes he's won. Since he passed the motion. They're building in the ocean. And he's saying all men should be free. What a combination, peace and radiation. And he's saying free men should fight for me. Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain,. And the rain, ain't that strange? very strange. I like choking toys. You've got to see me before you meet the boys. Teacher's burnt the school,. He's had enough of sticking to the rules. People stop and see. He's got to be more decadent than me. Just to pass the time. He gets his kicks from licking off the wine. Pretty silly ladies. All cynthia'd and sadie's. Call him and he takes their numbers down. Says he is a woman. Should have seen it coming. And she says she's married to a clown. Just like a lady she'll keep you guessing through the night. Not tonight,well I might,oh alright!"

ancient warrior,"There's no end - there's no beginning -. To the old man's story. Does he still remember me -. From lives gone by. Oh I see his spirit rising. Upon the back of time. I've got nowhere to hide. Will he keep a place for me. He is the king of all kings. The keeper of light. He holds eternity's wings. In his eyes an ocean's burning. Swollen seat of tears. Troubled mind the beating. War drums in his ears. No one ever hears his warning. Am I the one he calls. When they tell me they're afraid. Some say I'll be put away. He is the king of all kings. The keeper of light. He holds eternity's wings. My blood will spill my blood. My blood will spill my blood. In the wisdom of the prophet's. Never ending tale. Open up the eyes. Within your mind, he says. Crowned in his ancient glory. There's a king within us all. Some will say it's all in vain. That he doesn't have a name. He is the king of all kings. The keeper of light. He holds eternity's wings."
angry heart,"I still remember how it used to be. I thought the only thing. That mattered was me. You always told me it was just insane. To feel such joy. While others feel pain. There's no way to change this angry heart. Cause when love goes. It will tear you apart. And it's been this way since time began. It's a desperate search for a promised land. And the years slip by like so much sand. So many people who are dying to live. It tortures my heart. They've got so much to give. I never saw it as a battle before. To win the fight. There has to be more. And there's no way to change this angry heart. Cause all these fears. Will tear you apart. And it's been this way since time began. It's an endless journey, it's the fate of man. To live each day and never understand. And it's been this way since time began. It's a desperate search for a master plan. And the years slip by like water through your hands."
anno mundi,"Can you see me, are you near me?. Can you hear me crying out for life?. Can you tell me, where's the glory?. Ride the days and sail the nights. When it's over you'll find the answer. Running in the whispering rain. Anno Mundi? Can you wonder!. Truth or thunder, life or blame. Do you see a vision of a perfect place?. Does it make you laugh?. put a smile on your face?. Do you need a mirror?. Do you see it well?. Does the hand of God still toll the bell?. There are people laughing. They're all laughing at you. If only they could see. What you're saying is true. Still generals fighting,. Making war on the world. Don't they know, don't they know?. No, no, no. As the wind in the night blows cold. Your eyes are burning. As the sands of our time grow old. Anno Mundi. Do you follow the path that so many tread?. Are you among the blind so easily lead?. Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?. Depend on another to fight it alone. As the wind in the night blows cold. Your eyes are burning. As the sands of our time grow old. Anno Mundi. Can you see me now, can you hear me now?. Can you tell me where's the glory?. Ride the days and sail the nights. When it's over, you'll find the answer. running in the rain. There's a hope that's growing. And a vision too. All those angry hearts now reach out for you. Do you look to the dawn,. See a new day begun?. No longer the fool, the vision is done"
back streets kids,"I'm just another back street kid. Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig. Can't stop the music going round inside my head. I'm a rock 'n roll soldier,gonna play it until I'm dead. Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me. Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine. Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been. Playing my music,sitting in my hotel room. Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom. Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me. Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going. Got to see yourself in other's eye's,surprised?. Living like I want to don't come easy,but I'm trying. Sorting out what's true and what are lies,it's wise. Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land. Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands. So listen to the music,want to see you get so high. 'Cos I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die. Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me."

behind the wall of sleep,"Precious cups within the flower. deadly petals with strange power. faces shine a deadly smile. back up on you at your trial. Chill and numbs from head to toe. icy sun with frosty glow. Why'd you go reaching your sorrow?. why'd you go read no tomorrow. Feel your spirit rise with the priest. feel your body falling to its knees. Take your walk of remorse. take your body to a corpse. take your body to a corpse. take your body to a corpse. if you want all remorse. take your body to a corpse. Now from darkness, there springs light. Wall of Sleep is cold and bright. Wall of Sleep is lying broken. Sun shines in, you are awoken."

Mother's screaming in the fire. Satan points at me again. Opens the door to push me in. Oh No!. This is the end my friend. Satan's coming 'round the bend. people running 'cause they're scared. You people better go and beware!. No! No! Please! No!"
born again,"As you look through my window. Deep into my room. At the tapestries all faded. Their vague and distant glories. Concealed in the gloom. The icy fingers of forgotten passions. Softly brushing my lips. At the tips of my primitive soul. As you look through my door. Deep into my room. Can you feel the mighty wall of power. It's waiting, waiting in the gloom. The distant shadows of forgotten champions. Those who live in me still. And will rise when we challenge and kill. Born again. You'll be born again. Look at this prince of evil. Fighting for your mind. Fighting all the priests of shame. For the thrust of my challenge is aimed. At the hearts of mutant gods. who think we're all the same. They're controlling our minds. And they use us for fortune and fame. As you look through my window. Deep into my room. At your future and freedom. The grey and plastic retards all floating in circles. And as you taste the fruits of new sensations. Softly brushing your lips. As we rise when we challenge and kill. Born again. You'll be born again. If you want to be king for a day. Just do what I say. Everybody's got to think like a hunter. Just search for your prey. Be alive through the night and the day. Just do it my way"
born to lose,"I'll play your game. But if you lose you're gonna have to pay the price. Broken chains, like a prisoner free at last. The fear inside just up and died. Time will tell if i am wrong. It won't be too long. You thing I'm chasing shadows. In the dark. Well I'm not born to lose. I'm not born to lose. You curse my name, as you turn and walk away, from view. It won't be too long. You don't scare me cos you're. Hard to see and it's time. That you were gone. It won't be too long. You think I'm chasing shadows. In the dark. Well I'm not born to lose. You think I'm chasing shadows. In the dark. What you gonna do about it now. What you gonna do about it now. It won't be too long. It won't be too long. It won't be too long. You think I'm chasing shadows. In the dark. What you gonna do about it now. What you gonna do about it now. Ain't nothing I can do about it now."
buried alive,Once upon a nightmare. Once upon a time. You're running from temptation. You got lost. And found that you don't. Belong to anybody. You're all the same. Just another number. Cross it out. Whenever you don't behave. Someone got the doctor. He knows what to do. Throw some bones and mumble. The devil's inside of you. It might be contagious. It might change the plan. Get back in your tiny boxes. Even if you can't. We say you can. Join the congregation. Everybody's got to get in line and. We never justify. The choir sings a never-ending lie. Pre-chorus:. When you thought you were free. You didn't need a reason. No reason to survive. Chorus:. As the big door closes. And you waiting for the nail. Somebody tell the world. You're buried alive. Once upon a nightmare. Once upon a time. You're running from tomorrow. You got lost. And found that another. Day has turned to ashes. Taken by the wind. Frozen seeds of sorrow. Never to begin. Join the celebration. And everybody's got to get in line and. We never justify. The choir sings a never-ending lie. Pre-chorus:. When you thought you were free. You did not need a reason. No reason to survive. Chorus:. As the big door closes. And you waiting for the mail. Somebody tell the world. You're buried alive. One more nightmare. Just one more time. Join the congregation. Everybody get in line. Celebration. The choir sings a lie. As you call. The hammer falls. And no one hears you cry. I'm buried alive.
call of the wild,"In this last and final hour, you can't hide. There's nowhere now that you can run. All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light. Princes and Kings, Demons with wings. Summon your fears from hell. It's the call of the wild Calling you. In this last macabre hour, witches cry. and turn to dust before the moon. Many spirits are lost forever, but one survives. To call the tune of lucifer. It's the call of the wild Calling you. Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams. Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems. All you gotta do now is stay free. You're the one they turn to when hell screams. Fear of the devil has no place among the brave. Faced with pain, there's a battle to be won. All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light. Princes and Kings, Demons with wings. Summon your fears from hell. It's the call of the wild Calling you. Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams. Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems. Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams. Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems. Hero, you got the fear of the devil burning your soul. Hero, It's the call of the wild. Hero, Tearing your soul."
can't get close enough,"How many tears must we cry before learning,. Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,. Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.. Why do you believe that we've got something coming,. You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,. Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,. Too far away.. In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,. Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.. What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,. You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.. Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.. All I need is understanding and the right to survive,. Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by.. What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,. You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.. Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.. Too far away.. Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.. How many tears must we cry before learning,. Things that we had they're for real and we're losing,. Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.. Too far away, too far away, too far away.."
cardinal sin,"Where Do You Go When Your Conscience Takes Over. Do You Crawl To Your Corner And Cry.. Did You Imagine, That No One Would Notice. Just A Secret To Take When You Die.. All The World Is Watching You,. Every Tongue Is Screaming. Sinner. How Are Your Dreams? Do They Claw At Your Sleep?. Making Darkness A Place You Despise,. Where Is The God, That Once Was Your Strength. Are You Sure He Was There From The Start?. All The World Is Watching You, Nowhere You Can Hide,. Every Tongue Is Screaming, Only Satan Hears Your Cries.. When You Sin Cardinal Sin, You Make Your Bed And On It You Must. Lie, You Must Lie. And Your Future's Looking Grim, But Did You Ever Give A Damn. About The Child, He's Running Wild.. When You Sin Cardinal Sin, Don't Expect The World Will Treat You. Well,. Do You Think That God Will Forgive You All Your Sins Now. When You Need To Sell Your Soul?. We Point The Finger, Sin Cardinal Sin. Laugh In Your Face, Sin Cardinal Sin,. We Point The Finger, Laugh In Your Face,. Cause You're No Better Than The Rest Of The Human Race.. Oh Sin Cardinal Sin, Oh Sin Cardinal Sin."
changes,"I feel unhappy, I feel so sad. I've lost the best friend, that I ever had.. She was my woman, I love her so.. But it's too late now, I've let her go.. I'm going through changes.. I'm going through changes.. We shared the years, we shared each day.. In love together, we found a way.. But soon the world, had its evil way.. My heart was blinded, love went astray.. I'm going through changes.. I'm going through changes.. It took so long, to realize.. And I can still hear her last goodbyes.. Now all my days, are filled with tears.. Wish I could go back, and change these years.. I'm going through changes.. I'm going through changes."
children of the grave,Revolution in their minds. The children start to march. Against the world in which they have to live. and all the hate that's in their hearts. They're tired of being pushed around. And told just what to do. They'll fight the world until they've won. And love comes flowing through. Children of tomorrow live in. The tears that fall today. Will the sunrise of tomorrow. Bring them peace in any way. Must the world live. In the shadow of atomic fear. Can they win the fight for peace. Or will they disappear?. So you children of the world. Listen to what I say. If you want a better place to live in. Spread the words today. Show the world that love. Is still alive you must be brave. Or you children of today. Are children of the grave

children of the sea,"In the misty morning, on the edge of time. We've lost the rising sun, a final sign. As the misty morning rolls away to die. reaching for the stars, we blind the sky. We sailed across the air before we learned to fly. We thought that it could never end. We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run. Now it seems our world has come undone. Oh they say that it's over. and it just had to be. ooh they say that it's over. we're lost children of the sea, oh. We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played. hiding in our corner of the world. Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore. threw away the key and locked the door. Oh they say that it's over, yeah. and it just had to be. yes they say that it's over. we're lost children of the sea. In the misty morning, on the edge of time. We've lost the rising sun, a final sign. As the misty morning rolls away to die. reaching for the stars, we blind the sky. Oh they say that it's over, yeah. and it just had to be. oh they say that it's over. poor lost children of the sea, yeah. LOOK OUT! the sky is falling down!. LOOK OUT! The world is spinning round and round and round!. LOOK OUT! The sun is going black, black. LOOK OUT! It's never never never coming back, LOOK OUT!."
computer god,"Waiting for the revolution. New clear vision - genocide. Computerize god - it's the new religion. Program the brain - not the heartbeat. Onward all you crystal soldiers. Touch tomorrow - energize. Digital dreams. And you're the next correction. Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeah. Take a look at your own reflection. Right before your eyes. It turns to steel. Chorus:. There's another side of heaven. This way - to technical paradise. Find it on the other side. When the walls fall down. Love is automatic pleasure. Virtual reality. Terminal hate - it's a calculation. Send in the child for connection. Take a look at the toys around you. Right before your eyes. The toys are real. Chorus. Midnight confessions. Never heal the soul. What you believe is fantasy. Your past is your future. Left behind. Lost in time. Will you surrender. Waiting for the revolution. Program the brain. Not the heartbeat. Deliver us to evil. Deny us of our faith. Robotic hearts bleed poison. On the world we populate. Virtual existence. With a superhuman mind. The ultimate creation. Destroyer of mankind. Termination of our youth. For we do not compute. No !."
cornucopia,"Too much in the truth they say. Keep it 'till another day. Let them have their little game. illusion helps to keep them sane. Let them have their little toys. fast sports cars and motor noise. exciting in their plastic waste. frozen food in a concrete maze. You're gonna go insane. I'm trying to save your brain. I don't know what's happening. My head's torns all inside. People say I'm heavy. They don't know what I hide. Take a life, it's going cheap. kill someone, no one will weep. Freedom's yours, just pay your dues. We just want your soul to use. You're gonna go insane. I'm trying to save your brain"
country girl,"Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine. She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul. Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning. Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah. . We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever. Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits. Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending. Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air. In dreams I think of you. I don't know what to do with myself. Time has let me down. She brings broken dreams, fallen stars,. the endless search for where you are. (sail on, sail on). Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine. She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul. Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady. Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!. Don't sail away on a crimson tide!. Don't leave your heart on the other side!. Her eyes are an endless flame. Desire with a special name. Don't ever fall in love!. Don't give your heart away!. No never, never fall in love with a country girl!."
cross of thorns,"Don't come closer, cause it ain't safe here,. Just turn around now and walk away.. I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here,. Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there,. Behind those-eyes.. Chorus:. When a promise is broken. And no one trusts you,. Young ones crying with their heads in their hands,. When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,. You can't help thinking. You've got blood on your hands.. From a cross of thorns.. Tongues of fire always talking, wasted words that. Ring in my ears.. We're still waiting, losing patience, will all the. Lies of, four hundread years.. I've got to tell you, there are no rules here,. Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there,. Behind those-eyes.. Chorus. We gave you yesterday. And now you want to-day,. Oh, from the hands of death we take our daily bread,. Now all we do is choke. And the words that you once. Spoke, fade away.. Look at what you've done, oh, it's a cross of thorns.. Take away, this cross of thorns, look at what you've done.. It's a cross of thorns, cross of thorns.. When a promise is broken. And no one trusts you,. You've got blood on your hands. From a cross of thorns."
cry all night,"Caught up in the pain of a broken heart. Life isn't what it seems. Because it's all been torn apart. It's my imagination playing tricks on me?. The politics of love. Have turned into a conspiracy. Wash your life in mother's tears. Grieving after all disease. Tell me who gave you the right. Get down on your knees and cry all night. Cry all night. Insanity and madness, better or for worse. Dishonesty and lies. Have turned a blessing to a curse. And in this world of sadness. It's easier to blame. Deception and denial. Shuns the burning of the flame. The path of life leads to the grave. God have mercy, Jesus save. Guide us through, now, hold on tight. Get down on your knees and cry all night. Why don't we try to find a real solution?. No need to cry, so wipe away those tears. So many times I've tried, but you won't listen. Now it's too late to save those wasted years. Mind assassination, break the golden rules. Who do you think you are?. To me, you're just another fool. You didn't to reason, you didn't even try. Only see things from your side. It's all a one way ride. Don't go under, stand your right. Wish someone would stop the fight. Shattered dreams fall out of sight. Get down on your knees and cry all night. Cry all night. You're gonna cry all night. Cry all night"
damaged soul,"Born in a graveyard adopted by sin. I cultivate evil that's living within. A preacher tried saving. My black damaged soul. Possessed by a demon that had full control. The time it is coming when all life will end. With doomsday approaching to hell. We'll descend. Religion won't save me, the damage is done. The future has ended before it's begun. Death's hand and the crazy, I can't stand the light of day. Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray. God of the almighty never answers their call. Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him. I don't mind dying cause I'm already dead. Pray not for the living I'll live in your head. Dying is easy it's living that's hard. I'm losing the battle between Satan and God"
danger zone,"Midnight, something don't feel right. It's been too much, too far away from home. Hard life, living the hard life. I can't resist, I'm falling. To the danger zone. All day long I'm pushed and shoved. I just can't get enough. In the danger zone. Red light, don't stop for no red light. You know I'm always trouble on my own. Lonely, ever so lonely. I've got too much time. I'm heading for the danger zone. All day long I'm pushed and shoved. I just can't get enough. In the danger zone. I'm eager, eager to please. I can't stand no more. It's got me on my knees. Ain't gonna feel no hurt. Ain't gonna feel no pain. I got nothin' left to lose. I ain't got no shame. Don't try to stop me. Just leave me on my own. I'm gonna live or die. In the danger zone. I'm living in the danger zone. In the danger zone. Hard life, I'm living the hard life. I'm gonna take a chance. In the danger zone. Lonely, ever so lonely. I'm gonna live or die. In the danger zone4. Midnight, can't wait until midnight. Help e I'm falling to the danger zone."
dark side of love,Dark side of love. Promise my all (?). Now that you're gone. I'm broken apart. I'll take my place. The dark side of love. Gave you my heart. You warmed my soul. How can I?. That's it my fate. Destiny call. The dark side of love. It's taking it's call. Making my heart. Losing control. I'll make my way. Alone in the cold. On the dark side of love. Dark side of love.

dear father,"A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears. The demons that you fought. Are feeding your fears. The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed. The truth destroys you which no longer conceals. Dear Father, forsaken. You knew what you were doing. In silence your violence. Has left my life in ruins, yeah!. In ruins, yeah!. You preyed upon my flesh. Then prayed for my soul. Belief betrayed by lust of faith that you stole. Indoctrination by a twisted desire. The catechism of an evil Messiah. Dear Father, forgive me. I know just what I'm doing. In silence, this violence. Will leave your life in ruins, yeah!. In ruins, yeah!. Preacher of theocracy. Hiding your hypocrisy. Under a false sanctity. Holy phony empathy. You have taken my life. Now it's your turn to die!. Can you sleep at night?. When you close your eyes. Do you think of all the pain from your lies?. Or do you deny. you're responsible for the victims. Of the sins you devised?. What you gonna tell them. When they ask you well then?. Is your conscience brewed in your heart?. There is no exception, when you seek redemption. For all the lives that you've torn apart!. Your molestations of the cross you defiled. A man once holy, now he spies and reviles. You took possession when confessing my sins. And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeah!. Dear Father, forsaken. You knew what you were doing. In silence, your violence. Has left my life in ruins, yeah!. In ruins, yeah, yeah, yeah!. In ruins, yeah!"
devil and daughter,"Silence is mocking the dawn of a new day. Devil and Daughter are both on their way. The evil of her nature collects in her eyes. With him there's no fear of the dawn bringing light. Baptised with fire, too wild to be tamed. She's hot, evil and ready to take any man. Let no one put assunder the power of the pain. He is the master of hell riding again. Devil and Daughter - pleasure and pain. Devil and Daughter - is this the end. A thousand times over, you'll hear on the wind. in the name of hell, these sinners never sinned. But Satan never listens to the words that they send. Drenching the soul with blood, when will it end.

die young,"Yell to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all. your back's to the wall. Then chase the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,. you run, you run!. Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told:. you'll never get old. Life's fantasy - to be locked away and still to think you're free. you're free, we're free!. [Chorus]. So live for today. Tomorrow never comes. Die Young. Die young, die young. can't you see the writing on the wall?. Die young, gonna die young. someone stopped the pain. Yell to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all. your back's to the wall. Then chase the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,. you run, you run!. So live for today. Tomorrow never comes. Die young, young!. Die young, die young!. Die young, die young, young!. Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!!"
digital bitch,"She wears her leather just to satisfy. she really throws it around. There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy. she's the richest bitch in town. Her big fat daddy was a money machine. he made a fortune from computers. She's got more money than I've ever seen. but she's a greedy emotional looter. Keep away from the digital bitch. Keep away from the digital bitch. Keep away from the digital bitch. She's so rich, the digital bitch. She's got five rollers and a fine estate. a big house up on the hill. She throws parties just to celebrate. her life is just one enormous thrill. She buys poor people just to have around. She has a trophy for each lover. The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound. she's got a lot more to discover. Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil. But she's just an imitation woman up for sale. She got so famous that she's on TV. She's got a professional smile. But I switch over 'cos she ain't for me. She disturbs me all the while. She looks so happy but she's got it wrong. she's always going faster. She sings her life to such a different song. she needs a loving and dominant master."

Gotta be good then everyting will be o.k.. if I could score tonight then I will end up happy. A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day..."
disturbing the priest,"Let's try getting to the sky, hang on or you're going to die. Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying at your feet. Sweet child with an innocent smile.

Do we mind disturbing the priest,. Not at all, not at all, not in the least. Good life is contradiction. Because of the crucifixion. If you're ready and have the need,.

ear in the wall,Hello can you hear me. I might not be alone. Don't see anyone near me. But I just might go home again. Lets meet in the morning. I just can't speak tonight. This is more than a warning. Be silent till its light and then. You know I'll be there. Waiting for someone to believe me. Remembering it all. Make my flesh start to crawl. I've seen an ear in the wall. This time it could prove it. But you've heard this all before. Cry wolf and you're moving. To a special kind of danger zone. I need a witness. Somebody just like you. So bring an exorcist. A wizard and the Holy Ghost. You know I'll be there. Waiting for someone to believe me. Remembering it all. Make my flesh creep and crawl. I've seen an ear in the wall. One more reason one more time. Someone's walking through my mind. Now where am I suppose to go. Its not who you are its who you know. What's it gonna be. I knew you would answer. I'm the curiosity. You could miss a chance because. The fool might see reality. There it is in the corner. You must be going blind. What's wrong were you born before. Your god invented eyes. It's got to be there. Grinding away at my secrets. It's going so dark. And you can't see it all. I'll turn on some lights. So you're sure not to fall. It's next to the eye in the wall

Burning glow of unseen fire,. like electric funeral pyre. Buildings crashing. down to the stoney ground. Rivers turn to wood,. ice melts into blood. Earth lies in death bed,. Clouds cry water dead. Tearing life away, here's the burning pay. Electric funeral. Electric funeral. Electric funeral. Electric funeral. And so in the sky shines the electric eye.

Rewinds the future to the past. To find the source of the solution. The system has to be recast. Release your mind. Fast forward to the secrets of your code. Your life's on overload. Delete or save, the units that make you an entity. That's your identity. If you don't know. Which way to go. You may be lost and confused. A second chance. Your time to lose. Reanimation of your cyber sonic soul. Transforming time and space beyond control. Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate. Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too late. You don't want to be a robot ghost. Occupied inside a human host. Analyzed and cloned relentlessly. Synthesized until they set you free. Alright-okay, alright, till they set you free. Alright-okay, till they set you free. I don't see you. I don't wanna see you"

god is dead?,"Lost in the darkness. I fade from the light. Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior. Help me make it through the night. Blood on my conscience. And murder in mind. Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom. Now my body is my shrine. The blood runs free. The rain turns red. Give me the wine. You keep the bread. The voices echo in my head. Is God alive or is God dead?. Is God dead?. Rivers of evil run through dying land. Swimming in sorrow. They kill, steal, and borrow. There is no tomorrow. For the sinners will be damned. Ashes to ashes you cannot exhume a soul. Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust. Leaves you empty and unwhole?. When will this nightmare be over? Tell me. When can I empty my head?. Will someone tell me the answer?. Is God really dead?. Is God really dead?. To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath. I transfer from reality into a living death. I empathize with enemies until the time is right. With God and satan at my side. From darkness will come light. I watch the rain as it turns red. Give me more wine. I don?t need bread. These riddles that live in my head. I don?t believe that God is dead. God is dead. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. Wondering if we will meet again on the other side. Do you believe a word what the good book said?. Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead?. God is dead. Right. But still the voices in my head are telling me that God is dead. The blood pours down. The rain turns red. I don?t believe that God is dead. God is dead"

gypsy,"Watching the universe at the end of another day. Fatalistic ships froma distant shore. In the back of my mind I could see she was standing there. Like the feeling you have. When you've been there before. She was a gypsy woman. She was as cold as the day. She said I'd got it coming. And then she took me away. She took me through the shadows of her sunken dream. I thought it's over me,she wasn't all she seemed. She took my hand and then she started to speak. She told me she'd had the call. With eyes of fire that were burning my soul. She looked into her crystal ball. She read my fortune then she read my mind. She didn't like my thoughts at all. She showed me shadows,a spectre of life. My soul just wanted to scream. She stared so deeply into my eyes. That's when I fell into a dream. When I awoke in bed she lay beside me. And she read me with her eyes,she said. So you wanna be a gypsy,come on now. Gypsy woman you're the devil in drag. You are the queen of all hell. You took my body,now you're wasting my soul. You've got me under your spell. And as the sun shines on another day.

I'm living in a room without any view. I'm living free because the rent's never due. The synonyms of all the things that I've said. Are just the riddles that are built in my head. Hole in the sky, gateway to heaven. Window in time, through it I fly. I've seen the stars disappear in the sun. The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun. And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars. I don't believe there's any future in cause. Hole in the sky, take me to heaven. Window in time, through it I fly. Yeah. I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast. I've seen the western world go down in the east. The food of love became the greed of our time. But now I'm living on the profits of pride"
hot line,Take me to the river baby drink my wine. When I'm going down won't you throw me a line. Lead me to religion take me up them stairs. When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers. When will you show me a sign. When will you throw me a line. Help me to the answer baby set me free. I'm torn between the devil and the deep blue sea. Maybe if you wanted you could save my face. Keep me out of trouble and I'm a living disgrace. Show me to a sucker and you'll see my name. Standing in a line with the shadows of fame. Lead me to a legend take me up them stairs. When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers.
i,"I am anger. Under pressure. Lost in cages. A prisoner. The first to escape. I am wicked. I am legion. Strength in numbers. A lie. The number is one. Chorus:. I - I - I. Everything that I see is for me. Yes, I am giant. I'm a monster. Breaking windows. In houses. Buildings of glass. Rebel rebel. Holy outlaw. Ride together. Don't try it. The power's in one. Chorus:. I - I - I. I am standing alone. But I can rock you. I - I - I. On the edge of the blade. But the knife can't cut the hero down. I am virgin. I'm a whore. Giving nothing. The taker. The maker of war. I'll smash your face in. But with a smile. All together. You'll never. Be stronger than me. Chorus:. I - I - I. Right here on my own. But I still rock you. I - I - I. Don't follow behind. Just leave me on the outside. I - I - I. I am standing alone. But I can shock you. I - I - I. On the edge of the blade. But no one makes the hero bleed. ( No, no , no ). I am hunger. Feed my head. All together. You'll never. Never make the hero bleed. ( No, no, no )"

i won't cry for you,"So you lie awake and think about tomorrow,. And you try to justify the things you've done,. But there's no one here, to hear your tears falling,. When you turn around, you find out, that you're the lonely one.. And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow,. And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure,. And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears.. So I won't cry for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you,. And I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you.. Ain't gonna cry for you.. So you lie awake and think about the sorrow,. Does it really still the fears in your mind,. And you try to realise the things you wanted,. But you take it all for granted and now it makes you blind.. And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow,. And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure,. And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears.. So I ain't gonna cry for you, no I ain't gonna die for you,. And I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you.. Ain't gonna cry. I ain't gonna cry for you, I ain't gonna cry.. So I ain't gonna cry for you, no I ain't gonna die for you,. No I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you,. Ain't gonna cry, ain't gonna cry for you no more,. Ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna die for no more,. Ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie for no more,. Ain't gonna cry, I ain't gonna cry for you no more.."

in for the kill,"Thunder shattered the dawn. Raging with fury, the king has come. The power of terror will reign. There is no mercy in pleading. In for the kill, no quarter be shown. Live for the thrill of battle alone. Blessed by the will to die for the throne. In for the kill. In for the kill. Freedom is taken by storm. The blood on his hands is still running warm. The power of terror will reign. There is no mercy in pleading. In for the kill, no quarter be shown. Live for the thrill of battle alone. Blessed by the will to die for the throne. In for the kill. For the kill. Thunder shattered the dawn. Raging with fury, the king has come. Death and destruction riding the storm. Blood on his hands still running warm. In for the kill. The king has come."
in memory...,"No one told me the way I should feel. You left an aching heart. Lost and lonely, the feeling goes on. You were the one friend I had. You gave me so much love. Now the tears remind me you're gone. It still haunts me there's a silence. Where you used to be. It still haunts me. Just an empty space in history. It still haunts me. But life must go on, on and on. It's still haunting me. It's still haunting me. Haunting me. Haunting me."
into the void,"Rocket engines burning fuel so fast. Up into the night sky they blast. Through the universe the engines whine. Could it be the end of man and time. Back on earth the flame of life burns low. Everywhere is misery and woe. Pollution kills the air, the land and sea. Man prepares to meet his destiny. Rocket engines burning fuel so fast. Up into the black sky so vast. Burning metal through the atmosphere. Earth remains in worry, hate and fear. With the hateful battles raging on. Rockets flying to the glowing sun. Through the empires of eternal void. Freedom from the final suicide. Freedom fighters sent out to the sun. Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution.. Leave the earth to all its sin and hate. Find another world where freedom waits.. Past the stars in fields of ancient void. Through the shields of darkness where they find. Love upon a land a world unknown. Where the sons of freedom make their home. Leave the earth to satan and his slaves. Leave them to their future in the grave. Make a home where love is there to stay. Peace and happiness in every day"

iron man,"I am iron man!. Has he lost his mind?. Can he see or is he blind?. Can he walk at all,. Or if he moves will he fall?. Is he alive or dead?. Has he thoughts within his head?. We'll just pass him there. Why should we even care?. He was turned to steel. In the great magnetic field. When he travelled time. For the future of mankind. Nobody wants him. He just stares at the world. Planning his vengeance. That he will soon unfurl. Now the time is here. For iron man to spread fear. Vengeance from the grave. Kills the people he once saved. Nobody wants him. They just turn their heads. Nobody helps him. Now he has his revenge. Heavy boots of lead. Fills his victims full of dread. Running as fast as they can. Iron man lives again!"
isolated man,"I like being alone. I'd like to stay in my room all day and night. Don't like to talk on the phone. So please forgive me while I just turn off the light. Don't wanna see nobody. Ever and ever again. Don't you feel sorry?. I'm just a crazy, isolated man. I know me better than you. I hate to hear another persons screaming voice. What are you trying to do?. Leave me alone!. I won't be anymore in cries. Don't wanna see nobody. Ever and ever again. I'm not in any hurry. I'm just a crazy, isolated man. Why don't you leave me alone?. 'Cause there's nothing more I wanna say!. Thank you for caring but I'll be alright. Now will you understand and go away!. Don't have a problem living in my room because it's where I really wanna be. So please forgive me if you think I'm strange but I just wanna spend my life with me!. Don't wanna see nobody. Ever and ever again. Don't you feel sorry?. I'm just a crazy, isolated man. Don't wanna see nobody. Ever and ever again. I'm not in any hurry. I'm just a crazy, isolated man"
it's alright,"Told you once about your friends and neighbours. They were always seeking but they'll never find it. It's alright, cuz it's alright. Where to go and where to see. It's always been that way and it can never be. It's alright, it's alright. Give it all and ask for no return. And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn. That's it's alright, cuz it's alright. . It’s alright, it’s alright. . Don't you know that it's so good for you?. You can be making love and see it all go through. But it's alright, yes, it's alright. So I told you once about your friends and neighbours. They were always seeking but they'll never find it. It's alright, cuz it's alright. . Alright, alright, alright. Alright, alright, alright. Alright, alright, alright. Alright, alright, alright"
jerusalem,"The highway's screamin', callin' out your name. Cause every road that you travel on. there's a price to pay. A thousand eyes are starin'. but the blind still lead the blind. Where will you turn if it all goes wrong. and you're on the run Jerusalem?. You say you walked through the valley. you say you've seen the signs. Echoes call you from a distant age. Or is it in your mind?. Then a thousand souls rise from the sea. holding up the sun. And an angel cries 'beware your lies'. It could be the end of it all. Where will you turn if it all goes wrong. and you're on the run Jerusalem?. Everybody knows your name, every road leads to anger. Will it always be the same, is there reason to return?. Where will you turn if it all goes wrong. and you're on the run Jerusalem?. When an angel cries - Jerusalem. Better watch your lies - Jerusalem. When an angel cries - Jerusalem."
johnny blade,"Tortured and twisted, he walks the streets alone. People avoid him, they know the street's his own. Cold blade of silver, his eyes they burn so wild. Mean as a tiger, society's own child. Go the tiger, burn in hate. You know you have to, Johnny Blade. He's the meanest guy around his town. One look and he will cut you down. Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade. Life has no meaning, and Death's his only friend. Will fate surprise him, where will he meet his end?. He feels so bitter, yes he's so full of hate. To die in the gutter, I guess that's Johnny's fate. Rivals all across the land. He kills them with his knife in hand. He's the meanest guy around his town. One look and he will cut you down. Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade. Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade. Well you know that Johnny's a spider. And his web is the city at night. He's a victim of modern frustration. That's the reason he's so ready to fight. He's the one that should be afraid. What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?. Oh he knows his future's decided. And he ain't gonna change it, no way. He was born to die in the gutter. He'll keep fighting `till the end of his days. Been alone all through his life. His only friend is a switchblade knife. He's the one who should be afraid. What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?. You fool the people. Who's fooling who?. It's time to listen. Who's fool are you?."
junior's eyes,"Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears. He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would `pear. Junior sighed, as his hands reached out to the sky. Junior cried, the day that his best friend died. Yeah!. They're coming home again tomorrow. I'm sorry it won't be for long. With all the pain I've watched you live within. I'll try my hardest not to cry. When it is time to say goodbye. Junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain. His father was leaving, and Junior's grieving again. Innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything. Junior's sorrow, who knew what tomorrow would bring?. Yeah!. They're coming home again tomorrow. I'm sorry it won't be for long. With all the pain I've watched you live within. I'll try my hardest not to cry. When it is time to say goodbye. Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more. Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure. He desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars. Reaching for reason, along with the time and the scars. Yeah!. They're coming home again tomorrow. I'm sorry it won't be for long. With all the pain I've watched you live within. I'll try my hardest not to cry. When it is time to say goodbye."
keep it warm,"Sweet woman are you feeling right. What was it that you did last night. You made me crazy you made me fly. I can't forget the hungry look in your eye. Ooh what's the matter with me. I'm justa runner I was born free. But since I met you I can't leave you alone. I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home. Keep it warm at the place by your side. Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride. Keep it warm for me when we talk on the phone. Don't forget will you pretty one that your man is. coming homne. D'you hear the rumor that is going around. Say I'm ruined 'cos I'm settled down. It's not true well maybe half and half. you know I love you but I still like a laugh. Ooh I'm feeling fine I got it right for the first. time. Sweet woman I can't stay for long, but every one will be proved wrong. I'm like a gypsy, I need to roam, but don't worry. I'll be coming home. I need the danger I need the thrill. I need to know what is over each hill. Ooh I'm a different man I'm still running but you. understand. since I met you I can't leave you alone. I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home"
kill in the spirit world,"There's something wrong there's a chill in the air. and the blood in my vein's running colder. The eastern sky is beginning to silver. and the words that you speak start to falter. The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed. In the house of the dead there's a taker. Some say that this is the ultimate sin. When the spirit world turns to the alter. There's been a kill in the spirit world. There's been a kill in the spirit world. Behold the dead clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever. ""In glory die"" calls the voice of the void. Your assassin has cursed every spectre. The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed. and the house of the dead seeks a master. Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end. and a kiss on the wind whispers murder, Murder. There's been a kill in the spirit world. There's been a kill in the spirit world. When heaven is closer, it's pleasure and pain. Kill in the spirit world. Did you see another in black. is the blood in your veins running colder. If you did then there's no turning back. As the spirit world turns to the alter. The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed. and the house of the dead seeks the master. Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end. and a kiss on the wind whispers murder, Murder. There's been a kill in the spirit world. There's been a kill in the spirit world. Oh here it comes, oh no. The seal is broken, The eastern sky is beginning to silver. There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air. I feel the evil, I feel the evil. Somebody whispers murder. A kiss on the wind whispers murder."
killing yourself to live,"Well people look and people stare. Well I don't think that I even care. You work your life away and what do they give?. You're only killing yourself to live. Killing Yourself To Live!. Killing Yourself To Live!. Just take a look around you, what do you see?. Pain, suffering, and misery. It's not the way the world was planned. It's a pity you don't understand. Killing Yourself To Live!. Killing Yourself To Live!. I'm telling you!. Believe in me!. Nobody else will tell you. Open your eyes!. And see the lies!. Oh yeah!. Smoke it!. Get high!. You think that I'm crazy. And baby I know that it's true. Before that you know it. I think that you'll go crazy too. I don't know if I'm up or down. Whether black is white or blue is brown. The colors in my life are all different somehow. Little boy blue is a big girl now. Suddenly it's me who's strange. But you've never had to make the change. Never give your trust away. You'll end up paying 'till your dying day"
kiss of death,"This is no ordinary soul, that you're destroying,. Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time. We tried to show you on your way, but still,. You cannot see, you're hurting me. You told too many lies and so it ends, yeah. You tried to touch me, but then I knew your plan,. You tried to take my world away, oh no,. Now I see it, it's as clear as day,. No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance. You tried to lead me, to the land where you keep your lies,. But I've seen this read before, oh yeah,. There is no reason why I should listen now,. No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance. So many people tried before,. But still I came through stronger than before,. Someone like you will never get through my door no more,. Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible. Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible. Yeah. Every lie that you tell you get closer,. Closer to the edge of the Cauldron and in to the fire, yeah.

'Cause I've got no reason to lie, yeah. Forget your problems that don't even exist. And I'll show you a way to get high, oh yeah. Oh yeah!. So come along, you know you matter to me. Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah. Time to stop all your messing around. Don't you think that I know my own mind, oh yeah. Oh yeah!. Why can't you believe, it's not here to perceive. Do you always have to be told, yeah. For you have been taught that if your mind has been bought. Life's entire answer was sold, oh yeah. Oh yeah!."
the wizard,"Misty morning, clouds in the sky. Without warning, a wizard walks by. Casting his shadow, weaving his spell. Funny clothes, trinkling bell. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic. Evil power disappears. Demons worry when the wizard is near. He turns tears into joy. Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic. Sun is shining, clouds have gone by. All the people give a happy sigh. He has passed by, giving his sign. Left all the people feeling so fine. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic"
the writ,"The way I feel is the way I am. I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you. Just to you. What kind of people do you think we are?. Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you. Just for you. The faithful image of another man. The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you. Yeah for you. The shot troopers laying down on the floor. I wish they'd put an end to my running war with you. Yeah with you. Are you metal, are you man?. You've changed in life since you began. Yeah began. Ladies digging gold from you. Will they still dig now you're through. Yeah you're through. You bought and sold me with your lying words. The voices in the deck that you never heard came through. Yeah came through. Your folly finally got to spend with a gun. A poisoned father who has poisoned his son, that's you. Yeah that's you. I beg you please don't let it get any worse. The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you. Yeah curse you. All of the promises that never came true. You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true. Ah, that's true. Are you Satan, are you man?. You've changed in life since it began. It began. Vultures sucking gold from you. Will they still suck now you're through. (Cats, Rats). The search is on, so you just better run. And find yourself another way. Probably dead, they don't feel a thing. To keep them living for another day. (Rats, Rat). You are nonentity, you have no destiny. You are a victim of a thing unknown. A mantle picture of a stolen soul. A fornication of your golden throne. A smiling face, it means the world to me. So tired of sadness and of misery. My life it started some time ago. Where it will end, I don't know. I thought I was so good. I thought I was fine. I feel my world is out of time. But everything is gonna work out fine. If it don't I think I'll lose my mind. I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know. Listen to me while I sing this song. You might just think the words are wrong. Too many people advising me. But they don't know what my eyes see. But everything is gonna work out fine."
time machine,"Oh what are you gonna do. When there's a part of you. That needs to run with the wind. And the fire of burning yesterdays. Can only light the way. To lead you from. The garden of the dark. Stay out of shadows. Now look like the change is on. Tomorrow's never gone. Today just never comes. Go on and jump,yeah. Into the hurricane. You will forger the pain. It's only there. To exorcise your mind. Looking at the world. When you've open up your eyes. You've got to see the promises they've made. They're bloody lies and broken dreams. Your silence screams. Chorus:. You're living in a time machine. And you can choose just who you are. Someone that you've never seen. Somewhere you've never been. You're living in a time machine. Oh what are you gonna do. When every part of you. Just needs to catch the wind. And the fire of burning yesterdays. Can only light the way. To lead you from. The garden of the dark. Looking for the world. When you've opened up your eyes. You'll see you've got invisible chains. They're only lies. Not what it seems. I hear your silent screams. Chorus:. You're living in a time machine. Nobody cares just where you go. Taken where you've never been. ??? somewhere you don't know. You're living in a time machine. Why do you stay who you are. Be what you've never been. Someone you've never seen. You're living in a time machine. Yeah."
tomorrow's dream,Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak. catch the fastest train around nine. Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache. before it takes me away from my mind. Send me love and I may let you see me. Send me hopes that can spin in my head. But if you really want me to answer. I can only let you know when I'm dead. When sadness fills my days. It's time to turn away. and then tomorrow's dreams. become reality to me. So realize I'm much better without you. You're not the one and only thing in my heart. I'll just go back to pretending I'm living. so this time I'm gonna have to depart.
too late,"Soon it's never more. When you've got to pay for. Promises - made in the night. Call the magic one. And with the magic comes. Forever chained to the flame. Chorus:. It's too late. Too late for tears. Too late. And no one hears you. Do you feel a touch of evil. (then) It's too late. To wish and make it so. To feel the power growing. Stronger - blessed by the dark. And when the candle fades. You can say it was a. Joke you played. So you must let me go - no. Chorus:. It's too late. You've said the word. Too late. Something heard you. Too late - now the race is on. And you're run out of road. Too late. For tears. Too late. And no one hears you. Can you feel the touch of evil. It's too late. Oh oh oh save me. I believe in your name. Oh oh I've fallen down. But now I've found. Nobody to take the blame. Misery. It's come to drag me away. And when the hunter cries. No alibis. Get ready for judgement day. As the candle fades. You can say it was a game you made. So you must let me go, let me go. It's too late - you've said the word. Too late - something heard you. Too late - the spell is gone. And this time you're the fool. It's too late for tears. Too late. And no one hears you. Welcome to forever. Welcome it's too late. Too late."
trashed,"It really was a meeting. the bottle took a beating. the ladies of the manor. watched me climb into my car and I was. going down the track about a hundred and five. They had the stopwatch rolling. I had the headlights blazing I was really alive. And yet my mind was blowing. I drank a bottle of tequila and I felt real good. But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn. I went off exploring. I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it. I was turning the tires burning. the ground was in my sky. I was laughing the bitch was trashed. and death was in my eye. I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way. I had the wheels in motion. There was Peter and the Greenfly laughing like drains. Inebriation. The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch. in my imagination. But at the canal turn I hit an oily patch. Inebriation. Ooh Mr. Miracle, you saved me from some pain. I thank you Mr. Miracle, I won't get trashed again. Ooh, can you hear my lies. Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes. So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again. but there was no tequila. Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains. 'Cause there was no tequila. And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill. We began to roll. And as we got trashed we were laughing still. oh bless my soul."
turn to stone,She came from the past. She was never meant to last. Her destiny was fatal. From the start. A messenger from hell. She cast a deadly spell. On all of those who dare. To cross her heart. Ain't no use in you trying to run. Fate has taken it's toll. Just one look and the damage is done. Burn your eyes. Turn your heart into stone. History foretold of a circle. Cast in gold. An evil seed of power. Sealed within. But fate has lent a hand. Destroyed the golden band. And freed her soul. To wash the land with sin. Ain't no use in you trying to run. Fate has taken it's toll. Just one look and the damage is done. Burn your eyes. Turn your heart into stone. She cast a deadly spell. She put a spell on you. She's got evil in her heart. Turn your heart into stone.

turn up the night,"A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell. No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well. The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul. You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told. So get a good hold, yeah. Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are. A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far. A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know. So let it all go!. Turn up the night!. Turn up the night!. Turn up the night, it feels so right!. Nighttitme sorrow, taken like a pain. Black will not become a white, it's all the same. Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark.

The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul. So get a good hold, yeah. Turn up the night!. Turn up the night!. Turn up the night, it feels so right!. Turn up the night!.

tv crimes,"One day in the life of the lonely. Another day on the round about. What do they need. Somebody to love. One night in the life of the lonely. There's a miracle on the screen. What did they see. Somebody to love. He guarantees you instant glory. Get your money on the line. Gotta send me a plastic Jesus. There's a check in the mail today. That's what I need. Somebody to love. We just won't eat on Sunday. Gotta buy him a limousine. Somewhere to live. Somewhere to pray. . Every penny from the people. Keeps the wolf outside the door.

I've opened the door now; my mind has been released. Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky. No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die. I wanna live my life; I don't want people telling me what to do. I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true. Every day just comes and goes. Life is one big overdose. People try to reunite.

So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end. Just believe in yourself, you know you really. shouldn't have to pretend. Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind. Just live your life and leave them all behind"

valhalla,"Leading us on, to the land of eternity. Riding the cold cold winds of Valhalla. The Kingdom of Odin is the Kingdom of Gods. Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace. But someone among them had the skill of deceit. And raised the hand that would open the road to Hel. When the winds of Valhalla run cold. Be sure that the blood will start to flow. When the winds of Valhalla run cold. Valhalla. The ring has been broken and a soul must be saved. Among the bravest of men, who rides to Hel. The longships are sailing and the chariots ride. And yes the anger of Thor will serve you well. When the winds of Valhalla run cold. Be sure that the blood will start to flow. When the winds of Valhalla run cold. Valhalla. Raise your hands. reach and Valhalla will save your soul. Raise your eyes. and Odin will lead us on. They say that history repeats itself. upon the year of the seventh century. Well nobody knows, no you never can tell. So you'd better run now and hide away. When the winds of Valhalla run cold. Be sure that the blood will start to flow. When the winds of Valhalla run cold.

walk away,"Lord she's handsome. As she flows across the floor. Nothing I've seen in my life. Has ever pleased me more. She's got the look of freedom,. And it makes you think she's wild. But I can see right through it all,. It's the way to have a child. Oh, walk away. She's looking to love you. There's nothing to say. Just turn your head and. Walk away. Walk away, walk on. She moves in sunlight,. Never seen the night at all. Like a star in the midnight sky,. Burns before it falls. I've never been lonely,. And I can't imagine why. Maybe she could be the one to tell me,. I guess it's do or die. Can't see her fire. But I can feel her heat, all right!. It's rising higher. I'm walking the wire. Walk on by!. Oh! Walk away!. She's looking to love you. There's nothing to say. Just turn your head and walk away. Oh, walk on by, walk away!. Walk on!. You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher. But don't be fooled!

war pigs,"Generals gathered in their masses. Just like witches at black masses. Evil minds that plot destruction. Sorcerers of death's construction. In the fields the bodies burning. As the war machine keeps turning. Death and hatred to mankind. Poisoning their brainwashed minds, oh lord yeah!. Politicians hide themselves away. They only started the war. Why should they go out to fight?. They leave that role to the poor. Time will tell on their power minds. Making war just for fun. Treating people just like pawns in chess. Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah!. Now in darkness, world stops turning. Ashes where their bodies burning. No more war pigs at the power. Hand of god has struck the hour. Day of judgement, god is calling. On their knees, the war pigs crawling. Begging mercy for their sins. Satan, laughing, spreads his wings. Oh lord, yeah!"
war pigs (basement tapes 1970),Witches gather at black masses. Bodies burning in red ashes. On the hill the church in ruin. Is the scene of evil doings. It's a place for all bad sinners. Watch them eating dead rats' innards. I guess it's the same wherever you may go. Oh Lord yeah. Carry banners which denounce the lord. See me rocking in my grave. See them anoint my head with dead rat's blood. See them stick the stake through me. Oh. Don't hold me back cause I've just gotta go. They've got a hold of my soul now. Lords got my brain instinct with blood obscene. Look in my eyes I'm there enough. Yeah. On the scene a priest appears. Sinners falling at his knees. Satan sends out funeral pyre. Casts the priest into the fire. It's the place for all bad sinners. Watch them eating dead rats' innards. I guess it's the same wherever you may go. Oh Lord yeah

warning,Now the first day that I met ya. I was looking in the sky. When the sun turned all a blur. And the thunderclouds rolled by. The sea began to shiver. And the wind began to moan. It must've been a sign for me. To leave you well alone. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. You never said you love me. And I don't believe you can. 'cause I saw you in a dream. And you were with another man. You looked so cool and casual. And I tried to look the same. But now i've got to know ya. Tell me who am I to blame?. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. Now the whole wide world is movin'. 'cause there's iron in my heart. I just can't keep from cryin'. 'cause you say we've got to part. Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone. And watch you slowly take away. A love i've never known. I was born without you baby. But my feelings were a little bit too strong. Just a lit bit to strong

wheels of confusion,"Long ago I wandered through my mind. in the land of fairy tales and stories. Lost in happiness I knew no fears. Innocence and love was all I knew. was it illusion?. Soon the days went passing into years. Happiness just didn't come so easy. Life was born of fairy tales and daydreams. Innocence was just another word. was it illusion?. Lost in the wheels of confusion. Running through furnace of tears. Eyes full of angered illusion. Hiding in every day dreams. So I found that life is just a game. But you know there's never been a winner. Try your hardest, just to be a loser. The world will still be turning when you're gone. yeah when you're gone!"
when death calls,"He saw the world, dim with the glow of the vertical sun. His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying. Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me. Spirit of man, cannot be freed.. When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying. When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed. When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow. When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow. Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer. For I believe Satan lives, in the souls of the dying. Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me. Spirit of man, cannot be freed.. When Death Calls - Heaven is closer. When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying. When Death Calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes. When Death Calls - You're gonna burn. Don't look in those sunken eyes. Don't look and you'll stay alive. Don't laugh at the face of death or your tounge will blister. Can't die until Satan says you die. And Satan takes your soul. In the face of death or your tounge will blister. Don't look in those sunken eyes. Don't look and you'll stay alive. Don't laugh at the face of death or your tounge will blister. Can't die until Satan says you die. The Devil takes your soul. With all his wrath he calls the reaper. When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying. When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed. When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow. When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow. When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying. When Death Calls - You're gonna burn, burn, burn.

when i came down,"When I came down for the first hour. All of my problems had got a new form. You came to me clutching a flower. Talking of peace and keeping me warm. If you can believe in me. I will come for you. Instead of deceiving me. I want you, want you. When I came down for the next hour. All of my problems had got a new form. You walked away clutching your flower. Talking of peace and leaving me warm. If you can believe in me. I will come for you. Instead of deceiving me. I want you, want you. When I came down for the last hour. All of my problems had got a new form. She walked away clutching a flower. Talking of peace and leaving me warm"
who are you?,Yes I know the secret. That's within your mind. You think all the people. Who worship you are blind. You're just like Big Brother. Giving us your trust. And when you have played enough. You'll just cast our souls. Into the dust. Into the dust. You thought that it would be easy. from the very start. Now I've found you out. I don't think you're so smart. I only have one more question. Before my time is through. Please I beg you tell me. In the name of hell. Who are you?. Who are you?.
wicked world,The world today is such a wicked place. Fighting going on between the human race. People give good wishes to all their friends. While people just across the sea are counting the dead. A politician's job they say is very high. For he has to choose who's got to go and die. They can put a man on the moon quite easy. while people here on earth are dying of old diseases. A woman goes to work every day after day. She just goes to work just to earn her pay. Child sitting crying by a life that's harder. he doesn't even know who is his father
wishing well,"Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream. You find that life's not always what it seems, no no. Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real. Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel. I'll give you a star. so you know just where you are. Don't you know that I might be. your wishing well. your wishing well. Look in the water, tell me what do you see. Reflections of the love you give to me. Love isn't money, it's not something you buy. So let me fill myself with tears you cry, why?. Time is a never ending journey. Love is a never ending smile. Give me a sign to build a dream on. Dream on.... Yeah, Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream. You find that life's not always what it seems, no no. Love isn't money, it's not something you buy. So let me fill myself with tears you cry. I'll give you a star. so you know just where you are. Someday, some way, you'll feel the things I say. Dream for a while. of the things that make you smile. 'Cause you know. don't you know. oh, you know. that I'm your wishing well. your wishing well. your wishing well. I wish you well. I'm your wishing well."
you won't change me,"I'm just a man and I am what I am. Nobody will ever change my ways. I don't need money and I don't need no lies. I only need to live for today. But I'd like to talk things over with you. I want to hear the things you say,today. Although you won't change me anyway,no no way. I wish you'd come and see me,I'd like to hold you. I want to set my mind all free. You understand me woman,you give me time. But I don't need no sympathy. Still I wonder what it's like to be loved. Instead of hiding in myself. Nobody will change me anyway,no no way. Nobody's gonna change my world. That's something too unreal. Nobody will change the way I feel. So listen to me now,hear what I say. Please give me time and maybe love. If there's a God up there,well I hope he helps me. I need him now to set me free. 'Cos it may be that it's over for me. If you don't hear the things that I say,today. Nobody will change me anyway,no,no way. Nobody's gonna change my world,that's something too unreal. Nobody will change the way I feel"
zeitgeist,Astral engines in reverse. I'm falling through the universe again. Down among a dead mans vision. Faded dreams and nuclear fissions span. The strings of fear they are holding up the race. The puppets falling to the ground. The love I feel. As I fly endlessly through space. Lost in time. I wonder will my ship be found. On this sinking ship I travel. Faster than the speed of life. Not so super nova burns. The black holes turn and fade from sight. The strings of fear they hide within the human race. The answers burried underground. The love I feel. As I fly endlessly through space. Lost in time. I wonder will my ship be found. And very soon. The boundless moon. Will show us light. And as we crash. We'll pray and kiss. And say goodnight. Goodnight
zero the hero,"Accept the fact that you're second rate, life is easy for you. It's all served up on a gold plated plate. and we don't even have to talk to you. Your face is normal, that's the way you're bred. and that's the way you're going to stay. Your head is firmly nailed to your Tv channel. But someone else's finger's on the control panel. What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother. Zero the Hero. Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother. Zero the Hero. When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother. Zero the Hero. Impossibility impissibolity mother. Really a Hero. You sit there watch it all burn down. it's easy and breezy for you. You play your life to a different sound. No edge no edge you got no knife have you. Your life is a six-lane highway to nowhere. You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there. Where the heroes sit by the river. with a magic in their music as they eat raw liver. What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother. Zero the Hero. Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother. Zero the Hero. When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother. Zero the Hero. Impossibility impissibolity mother. Really a Hero. You stand there captain and we all look, you really are mediocre. You are the champion in the Acme form book. But I think you're just a joker. Your facedown life ain't so much of a pity. But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around the city. with your balls and your head full of nothing. it's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing. What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother. Zero the Hero. Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother. Zero the Hero. When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother. Zero the Hero. Impossibility impissibolity mother. Really a Hero"
