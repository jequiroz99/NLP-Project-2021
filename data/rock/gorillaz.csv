Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on. The pulse when it respawns. Tap your toes and clap your hands. (How many people ready to rock the house?). Come on trace the globe and shake your pants. (How many people ready to rock the house?). Just twist your hip and do the dip. (How many people ready to rock the house?). Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes. (How many people ready to rock the house?).

clint eastwood (phi life cypher version),"""Yo. Yo. Yo."". 'Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted.. I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed.. My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics.. I'm a lyrical misfit with a sadistic characteristics.. I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath,. and if a boy [?] test, then I be stampin' upon his chest. Done makin' a mess.. No other man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'. and I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human.. I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out.. And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout. that's workin' 'em out.. Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure.. Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture.. When I punch ya, I rupture one of your ribcage in a rage. and I turn you into a cartoon too, then erase the page.. I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flintstone.. Get Dino to tear-up your Moschinos and then force you to limp home.. I'ma take off like a jet pack, when I get back better step back.. I'ma make the crowd react and nod their heads until their necks snap.. I can flip-flaps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac.. and leave your head in a spin like staring at turn table slip mats.. I'm a conquering lion, big cat. This is real talk, not big chat.. Did ya get that? 'Cause I ain't no small timer, I rhyme on big tracks.. Now feel the vibes I create.. This heavy weight I'm about to detonate. and demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate.. To the top my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin',. take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin.. I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins.. My style is totally buck wild but most definitely happecnin'.. To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in.. To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'.. I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak.. Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete.. Concrete, concrete, concrete. Wha-wha-well-well-wha-well. . I'be been stoned ever since the days of creation, I've been red.. I'm a mad dred, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head.. My lyracism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain.. He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain.. I could never be a racist because I posess so many faces.. I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces.. With lines longer than laces I'm gracin' you with my presence.. The lyrics went flippity-flick, and ya bubble like effervescence.. I pulverize and bamboozle, shave numb skulls like a poodle.. I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle.. I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' callamities.. Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality.. At the speed of sound, I'm running around the clown that tried to defeat us. but that tenacity is an audacity that you ever thought you could beat us.. Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us..."

Our love. Broken. Broken. Our love. Broken. Is it far away in the. Glitter Freeze. Or in our eyes. Every time they meet. It's by the light. Of the plasma screens. We keep switched on. All through the night while we sleep. There's nothing you can do for them. They are the force between. When the sunlight is a rising. There's nothing you can say to her. I am without a heart. And the space has been broken. Broken. Our love. Broken. Broken. Our love. Broken. Broken. Our love. Broken. Broken. Our love. Broken

demon days,"In demon days, it's cold inside. You don't get nobody, people sigh. It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself. Hiding in a hole in there. All the glasses are too big. Bring it back, got to hold it back. To let you do that yet you don't want me back. Before it fall down, falling down falling down. Falling out to go far from the sun. In these demon days,. It's so cold inside,. So hard for a good soul to survive. You can't even trust the air you breath. Because Mother Earth wants us all to leave. When lies become reality. You numb yourself with drugs and TV. Lift yourself up it's a brand new day. So turn yourself round. Don't burn yourself, turn yourself. Turn yourself around. Into the sun!. Into the sun, into the sun.... To the sun, to the sun..."

911,"[Introduction]. Gorillaz. Back the fuck up. D12. [Proof]. There ain't no trouble in rock (rock). On every block (block). Late for School, Late for Work. But ahead of these cops (cops). My credit is shock, in the detinate box (box). Like, people take my life and thats pathetic as Pac's (Pac's). A waste of the talent, Say my boys is just no where. Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare. Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air. Shit arrogant apparent to punish people by their heritage,. Nato barriers, Hate embarrassed. There is the faith to cherish. In your room face to face with race awareness. A race to s?? army bombin' your God is with you. Calm over war, we gotta start our pistol. Cause if you right and, know you right, then where's your ritiousways. We sacrafice, snatch your life, many nights and days. Follow me into equality we might behave. And only christ can say the trife will reunite again. [Kuniva]. America Owns, Without a fucking care in my dome. Bearin' my bones, so far away staring at home. Stay at my zone, falling asleep late with my chrome. Feelin' hype from these rockets burning like straightenin' in thecones. Stay at the streets, bullshit and plans to beef. Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a K to my neice. Real nigga's feel us and fear us. Gorillaz beat on they chest when. Dangerous lyricist, I hope that you hear us. The spirit of Bugz is still in me. God bless it the trinity. Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's. Put the knife away, missles away strike and blaze. So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night andday. Right away blow your life away, so light your haze. Hold tight grenede's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed. Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage. The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged. [Chorus]. Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa. Ahhhayayayayay. Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa. Ahhhayayayayay. [Bizarre]. Everynight I talk to a black hawk, taking herion in bulks. Watch my body hit the chalks. I'm too lazy, mescalines got me crazy. Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby. And I ain't never going home, Bizarre can for go. It's cold I'll be for cyphering, right from wrong. As I sit in my seat and remain calm. And close my eyes and wait for the bomb (Here it comes!). [Airplane Blows Up]. [Swifty]. I'm gettin' the fuck on, I'm aggrivated. I know I'll make it, Im in a place full of hatred. Treatin' my life like a sacrred. Try to check me, I break your neck. Disrespect me you get injected. It's hectic with some bullshit that happen. You least expected. We just don't accept it nigga. I go ahead, lift my trigger. Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit. I'm a nitwit with a big dick, and big balls. I don't miss shit. I hit all, whoever that did this. We Gonna Getch'all. [Kon Artis]. Yo, yo. Now whether its Sadam or Bin Laden. Thats been startin all this trouble for us. Creepin horrors doin show after show, sleepin on the tour bus. We lost Aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no Tenges. You dont need us to say the world is fucked up dawgs can see it. Now it seems the public needs this shit to calm its kids. Cuz they findin out how you lied about your twisted sins. They say we bad for you but shit our music is your friend. They cant deter you from the truth cause we the helping hand. [Terry Hall]. We are one, and one is all. We are, We are, we are one. And one is all. [Chorus]"

Shakin' all them bangs out. Chemical cutthroats. Bound to blow the brain out. Cut to the brain. This ain't no game. I'll show no shame. I'll birth this blame. I'm twisted cain. I'll twist again. I'll push the blade. As plain as day. Known to what these sayers say. Known to what these doers do. We shoot where who and you-know-where. We's about to take it there. We's about to make it clear. We happy or we lonesome. The long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish. Ten spoons of spinach. The soul and the spillage. The cup that runneth ovah. Return of the OGAH!. Chorus. Close your eyes and see. When there ain't no light. All you'll ever be. Come on save the night. 'Cause i don't believe. When the morning comes, it doesn't. Seem to say an awful lot to me. Chorus"

clint eastwood (phi life cypher version),"""Yo. Yo. Yo."". 'Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted.. I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed.. My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics.. I'm a lyrical misfit with a sadistic characteristics.. I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath,. and if a boy [?] test, then I be stampin' upon his chest. Done makin' a mess.. No other man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'. and I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human.. I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out.. And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout. that's workin' 'em out.. Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure.. Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture.. When I punch ya, I rupture one of your ribcage in a rage. and I turn you into a cartoon too, then erase the page.. I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flintstone.. Get Dino to tear-up your Moschinos and then force you to limp home.. I'ma take off like a jet pack, when I get back better step back.. I'ma make the crowd react and nod their heads until their necks snap.. I can flip-flaps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac.. and leave your head in a spin like staring at turn table slip mats.. I'm a conquering lion, big cat. This is real talk, not big chat.. Did ya get that? 'Cause I ain't no small timer, I rhyme on big tracks.. Now feel the vibes I create.. This heavy weight I'm about to detonate. and demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate.. To the top my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin',. take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin.. I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins.. My style is totally buck wild but most definitely happecnin'.. To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in.. To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'.. I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak.. Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete.. Concrete, concrete, concrete. Wha-wha-well-well-wha-well. . I'be been stoned ever since the days of creation, I've been red.. I'm a mad dred, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head.. My lyracism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain.. He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain.. I could never be a racist because I posess so many faces.. I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces.. With lines longer than laces I'm gracin' you with my presence.. The lyrics went flippity-flick, and ya bubble like effervescence.. I pulverize and bamboozle, shave numb skulls like a poodle.. I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle.. I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' callamities.. Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality.. At the speed of sound, I'm running around the clown that tried to defeat us. but that tenacity is an audacity that you ever thought you could beat us.. Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us..."
cloud of unknowing,"Cloud of Unknowing. Gorillaz. (feat. Bobby Womack, sinfonia ViVA). On the cloud of unknowing. My world seems open. Every satellite up here is watching. But I was here from the very start. Trying to find a way to your heart. Oh the days are forgetting. They've gone out with the tide. Lost at sea somewhere, waiting. Like setting suns at the rodeo. Trying to find someone you'll never know. Oh sinking love. On the cloud of unknowing. Every satellite up here is watching. Waiting to see what the morning brings. May bring sunshine on its wings. . by: zer0-Z"

Bring it back, got to hold it back. To let you do that yet you don't want me back. Before it fall down, falling down falling down. Falling out to go far from the sun. In these demon days,. It's so cold inside,. So hard for a good soul to survive. You can't even trust the air you breath. Because Mother Earth wants us all to leave. When lies become reality. You numb yourself with drugs and TV. Lift yourself up it's a brand new day. So turn yourself round. Don't burn yourself, turn yourself. Turn yourself around. Into the sun!.

fire coming out of a monkey's head,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain. There was a town where. the people known as Happyfolk lived. Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world. Obscured as it was by great clouds. Here they played out their peaceful lives. Innocent of the litany of excess and violence. That was growing in the world below. To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain. Called Monkey, was enough. Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town. They came in camouflage. Hidden behind dark glasses. But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows. You see, without the Truth of the Eyes. The Happyfolk were blind. Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes. Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home. Jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head. Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead. The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead. In time, Strangefolk found their way. Into the high reaches of the mountain. And it was there that they found the caves. Of unimaginable, sincerity and beauty. By chance, they stumbled upon the place. Where all good souls come to rest. The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels. In these caves above all things. And soon they began to mine the mountain. Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world. Meanwhile, down in the town. The Happyfolk slept restlessly. Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures. Digging away at their souls. Every day, people would wake. And stare at the mountain. Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?. And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper. Into the mountain, holes began to appear. Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind. That chilled the very soul of Monkey. For the first time. The Happyfolk felt fearful. For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir. From its deep sleep. And then came a sound, distant first. It grew into castrophany. So immense it could be heard far away in space. There were no screams, there was no time. The mountain called Monkey had spoken. There was only fire. And then... nothing. Oh, little town in U. S. A. , your time has come to see. There's nothing you believe you want. But where were you when it all came down on me?. Did you call me? No"
fire flies,"If you see me floating too many times. My face will be painted in these white brick lines. 'Cos all my fears invaded. All the crazies put on buses. and sent up here to find you. Living on the limits. And if you say goodbye too many times. The center nose will find me and switch me off this time. Cos all my fears invaded. All the crazies put on buses. and sent up here to find you. Living on the limits. If all you ever get from the summit. is the count of the fall of man. Every calling cost makes you your heart. You were in the kind of game that put the force in me. I was ever chasing fire flies. Sometimes I follow the fire fly he takes me into the night. Baby I just survive, I'm lovedrunk, I'm sorry. am I losing you?. Sometimes I follow the fire fly he takes me into the night. Baby I just survived, I'm lovedrunk, I'm sorry. am I losing you?.

garage palace (feat. little simz),"Oh, Palace Flows. Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop. When the light shines through it I feel more exposed. Will it ever change here?. We'll just never know. Stimulation I'm in need of. See that time is of the essence. And this clock doesn't own a home. Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop. When the light shines through I feel more exposed. In tune. By myself On it, my mind is my weakness. Wear your strength, you might surprise yourself. Never deny yourself. I live in the space is my thesis. I know you need this, I know you need this. I'm prone to run out of pieces. That might connect to something bigger. All in your mind, could follow me. You should consider. Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever. What did you find?. Well come in here, and lit them with pressure. I look to the heavens and I saw open gates. I walked up and then I pause. What the fuck did you do this for?. Wish me luck when that midnight falls. Memories of a past life. Can this be this is our time?. Can this be this is our time?. Come on. In stillness. Known to the world, do you feel this?. Trapped in my mind. I'm 'bout to find solitude. I'm connecting all of these pieces. I know you need this, I know you need this. I'm folding, unleash the beast. Unknown is what I would be. If my whole purpose wasn't to speak. Now look at the time. I know that I'm early today. What did you find?. You giving up or running away?. I gazed to the stars. And this view can't be shared. There are no other eyes in this room. Mean the words when you sing your tune. Free as a bird when I intake fumes. Memories of this past life. Can it be this is our time?. Can it be this is our time?. Come on"

hallelujah money (feat. benjamin clementine),"[Verse 1: Benjamin Clementine]. Here is our tree. That primitively grows. And when you go to bed. Scarecrows from the far east. Come to eat.

But glad then my friend. Out in the field we shall reap a better day. What we have always dreamt of having. Are now for the starving. It is love, that is the root of all evil. But not our tree.

Seven thousand miles 'till we reach the core. And then we circle back and we stomp some more. Got it?. It's just like that. You promise all your life, then you turn your back. You glide across the space, and diagonal past. Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back. You move your hips and your arms like a cat. Spin three times, and you're back where you're at.

Put my engine back into overdrive. So I can breathe again, photosynthesize again. With the green hills of my home. I'm not gonna cry. I got more time to give. I'm not gonna cry. Find another dream. I'm not gonna cry. (Save the way to me). I got more time to give. (It's getting nasty). I'm not gonna cry. Find another dream. But if I got it right, you'd tell me. And if I was wrong, then I'd disappear. But I'm incapable. I'm not gonna cry. (Say the way to me). I got more time to give. (It's getting nasty). I'm not gonna cry. Find another dream"

(How many people ready to rock the house?). Graviational pull. I have you making a fool. Out of yourself on the dance floor. Doing back spins running man and more. Party down with Vigga and Candor. Coming to the jam. Or look like a landlubber. And do the aqua boogie. Win lots of goodies maybe. Pop a Gucci wallet turntables is talking to me. It's awfully groovy. Seeing all the treasure and the booty. And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin. I want y'all to just get down. Now when the MC rhymin' and the DJ cuttin'. I want y'all to just get down.

Going toe to toe with an enchantress. Get funky we've been funkadelic wearin' Pampers. While you eggheads is on the wall preparin' answers. Sharing transcripts while we over here. Dipping and dancin'. Rhythm romancin'. Wallflowers. Giving no action no. All hours we chillin' and max the flow. Relaxing. Opposites attracting. I'ma toss my hat in. Floss when the track spin. Like I'm on a crack bend. Jigging and wiggling. Freakin' booties speakin' to the cuties so belligerent. No religion just bump the feed on. You'll feel reborn. Negativity we just dead it like decoy. Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on. The pulse when it respawns. Tap your toes and clap your hands. (How many people ready to rock the house?). Come on trace the globe and shake your pants. (How many people ready to rock the house?). Just twist your hip and do the dip. (How many people ready to rock the house?).

clint eastwood (phi life cypher version),"""Yo. Yo. Yo."". 'Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted.. I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed.. My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics.. I'm a lyrical misfit with a sadistic characteristics.. I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath,. and if a boy [?] test, then I be stampin' upon his chest. Done makin' a mess.. No other man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'. and I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human.. I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out.. And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout. that's workin' 'em out.. Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure.. Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture.. When I punch ya, I rupture one of your ribcage in a rage. and I turn you into a cartoon too, then erase the page.. I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flintstone.. Get Dino to tear-up your Moschinos and then force you to limp home.. I'ma take off like a jet pack, when I get back better step back.. I'ma make the crowd react and nod their heads until their necks snap.. I can flip-flaps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac.. and leave your head in a spin like staring at turn table slip mats.. I'm a conquering lion, big cat. This is real talk, not big chat.. Did ya get that? 'Cause I ain't no small timer, I rhyme on big tracks.. Now feel the vibes I create.. This heavy weight I'm about to detonate. and demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate.. To the top my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin',. take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin.. I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins.. My style is totally buck wild but most definitely happecnin'.. To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in.. To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'.. I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak.. Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete.. Concrete, concrete, concrete. Wha-wha-well-well-wha-well. . I'be been stoned ever since the days of creation, I've been red.. I'm a mad dred, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head.. My lyracism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain.. He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain.. I could never be a racist because I posess so many faces.. I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces.. With lines longer than laces I'm gracin' you with my presence.. The lyrics went flippity-flick, and ya bubble like effervescence.. I pulverize and bamboozle, shave numb skulls like a poodle.. I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle.. I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' callamities.. Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality.. At the speed of sound, I'm running around the clown that tried to defeat us. but that tenacity is an audacity that you ever thought you could beat us.. Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us..."

Our love. Broken. Broken. Our love. Broken. Is it far away in the. Glitter Freeze. Or in our eyes. Every time they meet. It's by the light. Of the plasma screens. We keep switched on.

demon days,"In demon days, it's cold inside. You don't get nobody, people sigh. It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself. Hiding in a hole in there. All the glasses are too big. Bring it back, got to hold it back. To let you do that yet you don't want me back. Before it fall down, falling down falling down. Falling out to go far from the sun. In these demon days,. It's so cold inside,. So hard for a good soul to survive. You can't even trust the air you breath. Because Mother Earth wants us all to leave. When lies become reality. You numb yourself with drugs and TV. Lift yourself up it's a brand new day. So turn yourself round. Don't burn yourself, turn yourself. Turn yourself around. Into the sun!.

911,"[Introduction]. Gorillaz. Back the fuck up. D12. [Proof]. There ain't no trouble in rock (rock). On every block (block). Late for School, Late for Work. But ahead of these cops (cops). My credit is shock, in the detinate box (box). Like, people take my life and thats pathetic as Pac's (Pac's). A waste of the talent, Say my boys is just no where. Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare. Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air. Shit arrogant apparent to punish people by their heritage,. Nato barriers, Hate embarrassed. There is the faith to cherish. In your room face to face with race awareness. A race to s?? army bombin' your God is with you. Calm over war, we gotta start our pistol. Cause if you right and, know you right, then where's your ritiousways. We sacrafice, snatch your life, many nights and days. Follow me into equality we might behave. And only christ can say the trife will reunite again. [Kuniva]. America Owns, Without a fucking care in my dome. Bearin' my bones, so far away staring at home. Stay at my zone, falling asleep late with my chrome. Feelin' hype from these rockets burning like straightenin' in thecones. Stay at the streets, bullshit and plans to beef. Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a K to my neice. Real nigga's feel us and fear us. Gorillaz beat on they chest when. Dangerous lyricist, I hope that you hear us. The spirit of Bugz is still in me. God bless it the trinity. Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's. Put the knife away, missles away strike and blaze. So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night andday. Right away blow your life away, so light your haze. Hold tight grenede's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed. Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage. The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged. [Chorus]. Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa. Ahhhayayayayay. Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa. Ahhhayayayayay. [Bizarre]. Everynight I talk to a black hawk, taking herion in bulks. Watch my body hit the chalks. I'm too lazy, mescalines got me crazy. Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby. And I ain't never going home, Bizarre can for go. It's cold I'll be for cyphering, right from wrong. As I sit in my seat and remain calm. And close my eyes and wait for the bomb (Here it comes!). [Airplane Blows Up]. [Swifty]. I'm gettin' the fuck on, I'm aggrivated. I know I'll make it, Im in a place full of hatred. Treatin' my life like a sacrred. Try to check me, I break your neck. Disrespect me you get injected. It's hectic with some bullshit that happen. You least expected. We just don't accept it nigga. I go ahead, lift my trigger. Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit. I'm a nitwit with a big dick, and big balls. I don't miss shit. I hit all, whoever that did this. We Gonna Getch'all. [Kon Artis]. Yo, yo. Now whether its Sadam or Bin Laden. Thats been startin all this trouble for us. Creepin horrors doin show after show, sleepin on the tour bus. We lost Aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no Tenges. You dont need us to say the world is fucked up dawgs can see it. Now it seems the public needs this shit to calm its kids. Cuz they findin out how you lied about your twisted sins. They say we bad for you but shit our music is your friend. They cant deter you from the truth cause we the helping hand. [Terry Hall]. We are one, and one is all. We are, We are, we are one.

clint eastwood (phi life cypher version),"""Yo. Yo. Yo."". 'Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted.. I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed.. My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics.. I'm a lyrical misfit with a sadistic characteristics.. I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath,. and if a boy [?] test, then I be stampin' upon his chest. Done makin' a mess.. No other man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'. and I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human.. I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out.. And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout. that's workin' 'em out.. Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure.. Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture.. When I punch ya, I rupture one of your ribcage in a rage. and I turn you into a cartoon too, then erase the page.. I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flintstone.. Get Dino to tear-up your Moschinos and then force you to limp home.. I'ma take off like a jet pack, when I get back better step back.. I'ma make the crowd react and nod their heads until their necks snap.. I can flip-flaps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac.. and leave your head in a spin like staring at turn table slip mats.. I'm a conquering lion, big cat. This is real talk, not big chat.. Did ya get that? 'Cause I ain't no small timer, I rhyme on big tracks.. Now feel the vibes I create.. This heavy weight I'm about to detonate. and demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate.. To the top my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin',. take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin.. I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins.. My style is totally buck wild but most definitely happecnin'.. To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in.. To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'.. I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak.. Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete.. Concrete, concrete, concrete. Wha-wha-well-well-wha-well. . I'be been stoned ever since the days of creation, I've been red.. I'm a mad dred, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head.. My lyracism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain.. He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain.. I could never be a racist because I posess so many faces.. I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces.. With lines longer than laces I'm gracin' you with my presence.. The lyrics went flippity-flick, and ya bubble like effervescence.. I pulverize and bamboozle, shave numb skulls like a poodle.. I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle.. I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' callamities.. Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality.. At the speed of sound, I'm running around the clown that tried to defeat us. but that tenacity is an audacity that you ever thought you could beat us.. Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us..."

But I was here from the very start. Trying to find a way to your heart. Oh the days are forgetting. They've gone out with the tide. Lost at sea somewhere, waiting. Like setting suns at the rodeo. Trying to find someone you'll never know. Oh sinking love. On the cloud of unknowing. Every satellite up here is watching. Waiting to see what the morning brings. May bring sunshine on its wings. . by: zer0-Z"

fire coming out of a monkey's head,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain. There was a town where. the people known as Happyfolk lived. Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world. Obscured as it was by great clouds. Here they played out their peaceful lives. Innocent of the litany of excess and violence. That was growing in the world below. To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain. Called Monkey, was enough. Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town. They came in camouflage. Hidden behind dark glasses. But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows. You see, without the Truth of the Eyes. The Happyfolk were blind. Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes. Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home. Jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head. Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead. The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead. In time, Strangefolk found their way. Into the high reaches of the mountain. And it was there that they found the caves. Of unimaginable, sincerity and beauty. By chance, they stumbled upon the place. Where all good souls come to rest. The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels. In these caves above all things. And soon they began to mine the mountain. Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world. Meanwhile, down in the town. The Happyfolk slept restlessly. Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures. Digging away at their souls. Every day, people would wake. And stare at the mountain. Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?. And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper. Into the mountain, holes began to appear. Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind. That chilled the very soul of Monkey. For the first time. The Happyfolk felt fearful. For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir. From its deep sleep. And then came a sound, distant first. It grew into castrophany. So immense it could be heard far away in space. There were no screams, there was no time. The mountain called Monkey had spoken. There was only fire. And then... nothing. Oh, little town in U. S. A. , your time has come to see. There's nothing you believe you want. But where were you when it all came down on me?. Did you call me? No"

Living on the limits. And if you say goodbye too many times. The center nose will find me and switch me off this time. Cos all my fears invaded. All the crazies put on buses. and sent up here to find you. Living on the limits. If all you ever get from the summit. is the count of the fall of man. Every calling cost makes you your heart. You were in the kind of game that put the force in me. I was ever chasing fire flies. Sometimes I follow the fire fly he takes me into the night. Baby I just survive, I'm lovedrunk, I'm sorry. am I losing you?. Sometimes I follow the fire fly he takes me into the night. Baby I just survived, I'm lovedrunk, I'm sorry. am I losing you?.

garage palace (feat. little simz),"Oh, Palace Flows. Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop. When the light shines through it I feel more exposed. Will it ever change here?. We'll just never know. Stimulation I'm in need of. See that time is of the essence. And this clock doesn't own a home. Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop. When the light shines through I feel more exposed. In tune. By myself On it, my mind is my weakness. Wear your strength, you might surprise yourself. Never deny yourself. I live in the space is my thesis. I know you need this, I know you need this. I'm prone to run out of pieces. That might connect to something bigger. All in your mind, could follow me. You should consider. Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever. What did you find?. Well come in here, and lit them with pressure. I look to the heavens and I saw open gates. I walked up and then I pause. What the fuck did you do this for?. Wish me luck when that midnight falls. Memories of a past life. Can this be this is our time?. Can this be this is our time?. Come on. In stillness. Known to the world, do you feel this?. Trapped in my mind. I'm 'bout to find solitude. I'm connecting all of these pieces. I know you need this, I know you need this. I'm folding, unleash the beast. Unknown is what I would be. If my whole purpose wasn't to speak. Now look at the time. I know that I'm early today. What did you find?. You giving up or running away?. I gazed to the stars. And this view can't be shared. There are no other eyes in this room. Mean the words when you sing your tune. Free as a bird when I intake fumes. Memories of this past life. Can it be this is our time?. Can it be this is our time?. Come on"

hallelujah money (feat. benjamin clementine),"[Verse 1: Benjamin Clementine]. Here is our tree. That primitively grows. And when you go to bed. Scarecrows from the far east. Come to eat.

But glad then my friend. Out in the field we shall reap a better day. What we have always dreamt of having. Are now for the starving. It is love, that is the root of all evil. But not our tree.

Do you look like me, do you feel like me. Do you turn into your effigy?. Do you dance like this?. Forever. See yourself in Cupid's lake. Chipped in your head. Do you indicate to the satellites. Passing by the edge. When you get back on a Saturday night. And your head is caving in. Do you look like me, do you feel like me. Do you turn into your effigy?. Do you dance like this?. Forever. Do you dance like this?. Forever. Do you look like me. Do you burn like me. Do you look like me. Do you burn like me. Do you look like me. Do you burn like me. Do you turn into your effigy?. Do you dance like this?. Forever. Do you live like this?. Forever. Do you dance. Do you dance. Do you dance. Do you dance"
we are happy landfill,"The feeling in. Guts to the brain. It means you got it coming and you ain't got a chain. Their only attire. Is a typical vice. But if it gets you well, well you ain't being nice, no. No!. So follow the lives. Till they cut up your eyes. You won't be even seeing if you ain't growing lies. Then bought all the shit. That should never be sold. They put a gun above it and a narrow behold. We are the happy landfill. We are the happy landfill. All right!. The feeling in. Guts to the brain.

we got the power,"We've got the power to be loving each other. No matter what happens. We've got the power to do that. On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?. We've got the power to be. Ringing the great bell out there above us. We've got the power for that. We got the power to do that. They dream of home. I dream of life out of here. Their dreams are small. My dreams don't know fear. (I got all you). I got my heart full of hope. I will change everything. No matter what I'm told. Or how impossible it seems. (we got the power). We did it before. And we'll do it again. We're indestructible. Even when we're tired. And we've been here before. Just you and I. Don't try to rescue me. I don't need to be rescued. We've got the power to be loving each other. No matter what happens. We've got the power to do that. On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?. We've got the power to be. Ringing the great bell out there above us. We've got the power for that. We got the power to do that. Get yourself up to the silent altar. And call me. But don't forget the machines. 'cause if your choice. Is chipping it down on the m1 (1, 1, 1). Then you'll wake up in the morning. You'll be storming, oh, oh, oh. We've got the power to be loving each other. No matter what happens. We've got the power to do that. On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?. We've got the power to be. Ringing the great bell out there above us. We've got the power to do that. We got the power, power, power-pow-power. We got the power. We got the power"
welcome to the world of the plastic beach (feat. snoop dogg),"Gorillaz and the boss Dogg. Planet of the apes. The revolution will be televised. And the pollution from the ocean. Now with devotion. Push peace and keep it in motion. Kids, gather around. Yeah, I need your focus. I know it seems like the world is so hopeless. It's like wonderland. Now fascinate me. Picture and animate me.

white flag,"Look, yo, no castaway, no survivor. I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked. I feel small in this big wide world. A mummy ain't said 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' yet. I ain't Jesus but I'm walkin' on water. There's no bombs here, there's no walkers. I can break out of jail with a lighter. So is there any point in making laws, blud. This ain't Atlantis, are you sure. I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore. No rain, condoms it poured and up the road. You'll never guess who I saw. Uh, uh, uh, it's K-A. Look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym. Honey I'm home this is where I wanna live. Just found it like Nemo on the pillow. I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though. On the other side of the fence, bind to the ends.. No fence, no stress, no rent, no superficial shit, this real flow. Where the women look hot, but the beach cold. And the speech goes like, ""Hi little lady"". Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby. Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy. Swag up on a hundred degrees, not eighty. Look, if heaven had a VIP, uh, this is it: white sand, blue sea,. But I don't know who they are and I'm damn sure they don't know me. But I come in peace!. Cool! White Flag! White Flag!. No War!. No Guns!. No Corps!. Just life.. Just Love. No Hate.. Just fun.. No ties.. Just me and my mind.. Just me and my wife.. But tell me if I'm dreamin'. 'cause I don't wanna wake up till the evenin'. And I don't wanna be left sleepin'. from all the diseases that I breathe in.. Look, respect the island, no stealin'. And don't bring religion here, no three kings.. It's great and we ain't leavin'!. We come on in peace. Sing. White flag?. White flag!. by.. VizzoNi"
