here without you,"A hundred days have made me older,. Since the last time that I saw your pretty face. A thousand lies have made me colder. And I don't think I can look at this the same. But all the miles that separate. They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face. I'm here without you baby. But you're still on my lonely mind. I think about you baby. And I dream about you all the time. I'm here without you baby. But you're still with me in my dreams. And tonight, it's only you and me. The miles just keep rolling. As the people leave their way to say hello. I've heard this life is overrated. But I hope that it. Gets better as we go. I'm here without you baby. But you're still on my lonely mind. I think about you baby. And I dream about you all the time. I'm here without you baby. But you're still with me in my dreams. And tonight, girl, it's only you and me. Everything I know, and anywhere I go. It gets hard but it won't take away my love. And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done. It gets hard but it won't take away my love. I'm here without you baby. But you're still on my lonely mind. I think about you baby. And I dream about you all the time. I'm here without you baby. But you're still with me in my dreams. And tonight, girl, it's only you and me"

when you're young,So far away from knowing where I'm going. And trying hard to find out who I am. They all say that I don't know what I'm doing. I say they don't hardly understand.

To find out who I want to be. And I know it's inside of me. There's love in so much more. That waits behind that door. There's so much that I want to see. And I know it's inside of me. Oh, woah, woah. There's life and there's one dance. There's fate and there's one chance. To find out who I want to be. And I know it's inside of me. There's love in so much more. That waits behind that door. There's so much that I want to see. And I know it's inside of me. It's inside of me. Oh, it's inside of me. Oh, woah. . |. |. |"
there's a life,"When the days all seem to count for nothing. Is the hope that I hold onto now gonna count for something?. When the nights all feel like they're running together. That's when I keep on dreamin' about things getting better forever. All the days that come and go. Across the miles so far from home. All I find roads that ramble on and on and on. There's a life, there's a life that I'm missin'. So much more than I can see. There's a life, there's a life that I'm chasin'. That always stays one step ahead of me. Out of reach but I know that I'm getting closer. I believe that as long as I breathe that the dream's never over. Inside myself I try to find a way to keep this hope alive. I hold the line that keeps me hanging on and on and on. There's a life, there's a life. There's a life, there's a life I see. There's a life, there's a life. There's a life, there's a life for me"

Why should I hear what you say any longer?. When you don't even know where I've been. I feel something in me getting stronger. And I won't get kicked around again. If you won't listen to me. How can you tell me how I feel?. All along I told you. That I cannot feel the pain. Who are you to tell me. I'm not good enough?. All I've ever wanted was a place. inside of you.

Underneath the blood stained gown. He thinks about that little girl. And the one he has at home. And wonders what if that was my little girl. Walking down that road alone. [Chorus]. Maybe I'm just crazy or the devil got inside. But either way my soul is gone,. And I'll end this all tonight. The one hand throws the whiskey,. and the other throws the gun. As he cries out to the heavens. I am not my father's son. [Chorus]."

I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now. That you're gone forever. Now things are coming clear. And I don't need you here. And in this world around me. I'm glad you disappeared.

goodbyes,There's so much I would say. If I could see you one last time. But now I can't cause you're not here. But you're always on my mind. When I look up and you're not there. When I lie awake at night. All these things I ask myself. I don't know why. When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again. When it's the last time and you weren't ready for it to end. When a light leaves you standing along there in the dark. They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard. I look ahead but can't move on. I look back but I can't stay. I keep trying to be strong. But this pain it won't go away. I hope this will heal in time. Cause I can't go on like this. Right now I would give my life. For one last kiss. When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again. When it's the last time and you weren't ready for it to end. When a light leaves you standing along there in the dark. They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard. You'll be there on my mind. Standing in the sunshine. When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again. When it's the last time and you weren't ready for it to end. When a light leaves you standing along there in the dark. They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard
heaven,I got lost out there in this world. Looking for a brand new way to fall down. It's no surprise that things gotten worse. And I think God never let me drown. I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven - I just had to go home. While I was having the time of my life. I think my soul died a little every day. I always called to say I'm sorry. You said it's okay. But you should be through it all - you never walked away. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven - I just had to go home. Into the arms of my angel. Into the peace I left behind. All I had to do to save my own life. Was to look into your eyes. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I just had to go home. I just had to go home. I just had to go home. Crédito: Ronaldy JF Cunha

i feel you,"They gave me a life that’s not so easy to live. And then they sent me on my way. I left my loving, forgot my dreams. I lost them along the way. Those little things you say. When words mean so much. You never back down. And they all shy away. You always listen to me. And what do I care to get me through these sleepless nights. And what do I have to hold when no one’s there to hold me tight. And what do I see the only thing that gets me through this is I feel and I feel you. And this ain’t no bitterness. Then I’d rose just the same. Got this road short and can be long. Another endless day, another seven hundred miles that’ll take me further from my home. Those little things you say. When words mean so much. You never back down. And they all shy away. You always listen to me. And what do I care to get me through these sleepless nights. And what do I have to hold when no one’s there to hold me tight. And what do I see the only thing that gets me through this is I feel and I feel you. I know what you’re going through now. Believe me I live this. And what do I care to get me through these sleepless nights. And what do I have to hold when no one’s there to hold me tight.

story of a girl,This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her. When she smiles.. How many days in a year. She woke up with hope but she only found tears?. I can be so insincere. Making the promises never for real. As long as she stands there waiting. Wearing the holes in the souls of her shoes. How many days disappear?. You look in the mirror so how do you choose?. And the clothes that you wear. Look swell the next day. Your hair never falls in quite the same way. You never seem to run out of things to say.. This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her. When she smiles.. How many lovers would stay?. Just to put up with this shit day after day. How did we wind up this way?. Watching our mouths for the words that we say. As long as we stand here waiting. Wearing the clothes on the souls of our shoes. How do we get there today?. When we're walking too far for the price of her shoes.. And the clothes that you wear. Look swell the next day. Your hair never falls in quite the same way. You never seem to run out of things to say.. This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her. When she smiles.. And the clothes that you wear. Look swell the next day. Your hair never falls in quite the same way. You never seem to run out of things to say.. This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her.. This is the story of a girl. Her pretty face she hid from the world. And while she looks so sad and lonely there. I absolutely love her.. This is the story of a girl. Who cried a river and drowned the whole world. And while she looks so sad in photographs. I absolutely love her. When she smiles!. When she smiles!
superman,"I took a walk arround the world to. Ease my troubled mind. I left my body laying somewhere. In the sands of time. I watched the word float to the dark. Side of the moon. I feel there is nothing I can do. Yeah.... I whatched the world float to the dark. Side of the moon. After all I knew it had to be something. To do with you. I really don't mind what happens now and then. As long as you'll be my friend at the end. If i go crazy then will you still call me Superman?. If i'm alive and well,. Will you be there holding my hand?. I'll keep you by side. With my superhuman might. Kryptonite. You called me strong, you called me weak. But still your secrets I will keep. You took for granted all the times. I never let you down. You stumbled in and bumped your head,. If not for me then you would be dead. I picked you up and put you back. On solid ground. If go crazy then will you still call me Superman?. if i'm alive and well,. Will you be there holding my hand?. I'll keep by my side. With my superhuman might. Kryptonite (...3x). ....

that smell,"Whiskey bottles, and brand new cars. Oak tree you're in my way. There's too much coke and too much smoke. Look what's going on inside you. Ooooh that smell. Can't you smell that smell. Ooooh that smell. The smell of death surrounds you. Angel of darkness is upon you. Stuck a needle in your arm. So take another toke, have a blow for your nose. One more drink fool, will drown you. Ooooh that smell. Can't you smell that smell. Ooooh that smell. The smell of death surrounds you. Now they call you Prince Charming. Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes. Say you'll be all right come tomorrow. But tomorrow might not be here for you. Ooooh that smell. Can't you smell that smell. Ooooh that smell. The smell of death surrounds you. Hey, you're a fool you. Stick them needles in your arm. I know I been there before. One little problem that confronts you. Got a monkey on your back. Just one more fix, Lord might do the trick. One hell of a price for you to get your kicks. Ooooh that smell. Can't you smell that smell. Ooooh that smell. The smell of death surrounds you. Ooooh that smell. Can't you smell that smell. Ooooh that smell. The smell of death surrounds you."

the real life,I wanted to find somewhere to hide. And i opened up and left those fears inside. And i wanted to be in near on this. Only to find that there was noone there but me.

the silence remains,This world asks for so much. Despite what you give it's just never enough. Then you're left cold tired and alone. Searching for something that's already gone. You try not to be afraid. Bound down by all of these things that they say. And you feel like you're all by yourself. But I'll be right here when there's nothing else. Lay down. Rest here in peace in my arms now. Knowing you're safe. From the storms and the rain. And from all of your pain. And I'll be here when only the silence remains. Only the silence remains. Your fears they know that you're scared. Wherever you go they seem to meet you there. And you face them all on your own. Never the weak always the strong. And you win most of the time. Never once claiming that victory's mine. And you carry this burden alone. But this candle's burned at both ends for so long. Lay down. Rest here in peace in my arms now. Knowing you're safe. From the storms and the rain. And from all of your pain. And I'll be here when only the silence remains. Lay down. Lay down. Lay down. Rest here in peace in my arms now. Knowing you're safe.

there's a life,"When the days all seem to count for nothing. Is the hope that I hold onto now gonna count for something?. When the nights all feel like they're running together.

There's a life, there's a life that I'm missin'. So much more than I can see. There's a life, there's a life that I'm chasin'. That always stays one step ahead of me. Out of reach but I know that I'm getting closer. I believe that as long as I breathe that the dream's never over. Inside myself I try to find a way to keep this hope alive. I hold the line that keeps me hanging on and on and on. There's a life, there's a life. There's a life, there's a life I see. There's a life, there's a life. There's a life, there's a life for me"

This life ain't the fairy tale we both thought it would be. I can see your smiling face as its staring back at me. I know we both see these changes now.... I know we both understand somehow.... There's a life inside of me that I can feel again. It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been. I don't care if I lost everything that I have known. It don't matter where I lay my head tonight. Your arms feel like home...they feel like home to me.... (Just hold onto me). There's a life inside of me that I can feel again. It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been. I don't care if I lost everything that I have known. It don't matter where I lay my head tonight. Your arms feel like home... feel like home...they feel like home
