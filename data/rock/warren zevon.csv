disorder in the house,Disorder in the house. The tub runneth over. Plaster's falling down in pieces by the couch of pain. Disorder in the house. Time to duck and cover. Helicopters hover over rough terrain. Disorder in the house. Reptile wisdom. Zombies on the lawn staggering around. Disorder in the house. There's a flaw in the system. And the fly in the ointment's gonna bring the whole thing down. The floodgates are open. We've let the demons loose. The big guns have spoken. And we've fallen for the ruse. Disorder in the house. It's a fate worse than fame. Even the Lhasa Apso seems to be ashamed. Disorder in the house. The doors are coming off the hinges. The earth will open and swallow up the real estate. I just got my paycheck. I'm gonna paint the whole town grey. Whether it's a night in Paris or a Fresno matinee. Itâ€™s the home of the brave and the land of the free. Where the less you know the better off you'll be. Disorder in the house. All bets are off. I'm sprawled across the davenport of despair. Disorder in the house. I'll live with the losses. And watch the sundown through the portiere.

frank and jesse james,"Written By Warren Zevon. published by Warner-Tamerlane/Darkroom Music BMI, 1973. On a small Missouri farm. Back when the west was young. Two boys learned to rope and ride. And be handy with a gun. War broke out between the states. And they joined up with Quantrill. And it was over in Clay county. That Frank and Jesse finally learned to kill. Keep on riding, riding, riding. Frank and Jesse James. Keep on riding, riding, riding. 'Til you clear your names. Keep on riding, riding, riding. Across the rivers and the range.

frozen notes,"written by Warren Zevon 1971. Mr. Bones Music Inc. Publishing BMI. Softly falls the morning rain. Loneliness comes around again. And I sit and sing my song. 'Though it never seems to matter. And it never fills the emptiness inside. Frozen notes hang suspended in the autumn air. While someone waits for someone to come somewhere. No one waits for me. 'Cause I thought I wanted to be free. Now I'm wondering why I said goodbye. Looking through my window. At the dark and troubled sky. I think I see the ship of the brokenhearted passing by. And I turn away. From today. To where we used to lie. And I cry. Yes, I cry. And I cry. While softly falls the morning rain. Loneliness comes around again."
genius,"by Warren Zevon and Larry Klein. I've got a bitter pot of je ne sais quoi. Guess what--I'm stirring it with a monkey's paw. Since I saw you coming out of my barber's shop. In that skimpy little halter top. Did you light the candles? Did you put on ""Kind of Blue?"". Did you use that Ivy League voodoo on him, too?. He thinks he'll be alright but he doesn't know for sure. Like every other unindicted coconspirator. Mata Hari had a house in France. Where she worked on all her secret plans. Men were falling for her sight unseen. She was a genius. There's a a face in every window of the Songwriters' Neighborhood. Everybody's your best friend when you're doing well--I mean good. The poet who lived next door when you were young and poor. Grew up to be a backstabbing entrepreneur. Albert Einstein was a ladies' man. While he was working on his universal plan. He was making out like Charlie Sheen. He was a genius. When you dropped me and you staked your claim. On a V.I.P. who could make your name. You latched on to him and I became. A minor inconvenience. Your protÃ©gÃ© don't care about art. I'm the one who always told you you were smart. You broke my heart into smithereens. And that took genius. You and the barber make a handsome pair. Guess what--I never liked the way he cut your hair. I didn't like the way he turned your head. But there's nothing I can do or say I haven't done or said. Everybody needs a place to stand. And a method for their schemes and scams. If I could only get my record clean. I'd be a genius."

A scout from the flames came down from Saskatoon. Said, ""There's always room on our team for a goon. Son, we've always got room for a goon"". There were Swedes to the left of him. Russians to the right. A Czech at the blue line looking for a fight. Brains over brawn--that might work for you. But what's a Canadian farm boy to do. What else can a farm boy from Canada to do. But what's a Canadian farm boy to do. What else can a farm boy from Canada to do. Hit somebody! was what the crowd roared. When Buddy the goon came over the boards. ""Coach,"" he'd say, ""I wanna score goals"". The coach said, ""Buddy, remember your role. The fast guys get paid, they shoot, they score. Protect them, Buddy, that's what you're here for. Protection is what you're here for. Protection--it's the stars that score. Protection--kick somebody's ass. Protection--don't put the biscuit in the basket just. Hit some, Buddy! it rang in his ears. Blood on the ice ran down through the years. The king of the goons with a box for a throne. A thousand stitches and broken bones. He never lost a fight on his icy patrol. But deep inside, Buddy only dreamed of a goal. He just wanted one damn goal. There were Swedes at the the blue line. Finns at the red. A Russian with a stick heading straight for his head. Brains over brawn--that might work for you. But what's a Canadian farm boy to do. What else can a farm boy from Canada to do. But what's a Canadian farm boy to do. What else can a farm boy from Canada to do. In his final season, on his final night. Buddy and a Finn goon were pegged for a fight. Thirty seconds left, the puck took a roll. And suddenly Buddy had a shot on goal. The goalie committed, Buddy picked his spot. Twenty years of waiting went into that shot. The fans jumped up, the Finn jumped too. And coldcocked Buddy on his follow through. The big man crumbled but he felt all right. 'Cause the last thing he saw. was the flashing red light. He saw that heavenly light. There were Swedes to the left of him. Russians to the right. A Czech at the blue line looking for a fight. Take care of your teeth--that might work for you. But what's a Canadian farm boy to do. What else can a farm boy from Canada to do. But what's a Canadian farm boy to do. What else can a farm boy from Canada to do."

And the cold wind cut through me, it cut right through my clothes. And the anger and the yearning, like fever in my veins. Set the fire burning. She came down from Knightstown with her hands hard from the line. From the first time I laid eyes on her. I knew that she'd be mine. Her father was a lawman, he swore he'd shoot me dead. 'Cause he knew I wanted Jeannie and I'd have her like I said. Jeannie needs a shooter. Shooter like me. Jeannie needs a shooter. Shooter on her side. Jeannie needs a shooter. We met down by the river, on the final day in May. And when I leaned down to kiss her, she did not turn away. I drew out all my money and together we did vow. To leave that very evening and get away somehow. Jeannie needs a shooter. Shooter like me. Jeannie needs a shooter. Shooter on her side. Jeannie needs a shooter. The night was cold and rainy down by the borderline. I was riding hard to meet her when a shot rang out behind. As I lay there in the darkness with a pistol by my side.

model citizen,by Warren Zevon/Waddy Wachtel/Leroy P. Marinell. c. 1991 Zevon Music/BMI. Don't bring the milk in. Leave it on the porch. Don't read the papers. Don't mow the lawn no more. Drive to the market. At the break of dawn. Watch 'em unload the produce. Then ride right back home. It's the white man's burden. And it weighs a ton. I'm a family man. Model citizen. Torment the mailman. Terrorize the maid. Try to teach 'em some manners. Whip 'em into shape. Down in the basement. I've got a Craftsman lathe. Show it to the children. When they misbehave. It's the white man's burden. And it weighs a ton. I'm a family man. Model citizen. I'm a law-abiding man. I'm a good Samaritan. I pay my taxes when I can. Model citizen. In the cool of the evening. When the sun goes down. My wife's playing canasta. With everyone in town. When I feel the pressure. And I need a break. Load up the Winnebago. Drive it in the lake. It's the white man's burden. And it weighs a ton. I'm a family man. Model citizen.

mr. bad example,"Written By Warren Zevon & Jorge Calderon. c. 1991, Zevon Music,. administered by Warner-Tamerlane Publishing corp./Googolplex Music BMI. I started as an alter boy, working at the church. Learning all my holy moves, doing some research. Which led me to a cash box, labeled ""Children's Fund"". I'd leave the change, and tuck the bills inside my cummerbund. I got a part-time job at my father's carpet store. Laying tackless stripping, and housewives by the score. I loaded up their furniture, and took it to Spokane. And auctioned off every last naugahyde divan. I'm very well aquainted with the seven deadly sins. I keep a busy schedule trying to fit them in. I'm proud to be a glutton, and I don't have time for sloth. I'm greedy, and I'm angry, and I don't care who I cross. I'm Mr. Bad Example, intruder in the dirt. I like to have a good time, and I don't care who gets hurt. I'm Mr. Bad Example, take a look at me. I'll live to be a hundred, and go down in infamy. Of course I went to law school and took a law degree. And counseled all my clients to plead insanity. Then worked in hair replacement, swindling the bald. Where very few are chosen, and fewer still are called. Then on to Monte Carlo to play chemin de fer. I threw away the fortune I made transplanting hair. I put my last few francs down on a prostitute. Who took me up to her room to perform the flag salute. Whereupon I stole her passport and her wig. And headed for the airport and the midnight flight, you dig?. And fourteen hours later I was down in Adelaide. Looking through the want ads sipping Fosters in the shade. I opened up an agency somewhere down the line. To hire aboriginals to work the opal mines. But I attached their wages and took a whopping cut. And whisked away their workman's comp and pauperized the lot. I'm Mr. Bad Example, intruder in the dirt. I like to have a good time, and I don't care who gets hurt. I'm Mr. Bad Example, take a look at me. I'll live to be a hundred and go down in infamy. I bought a first class ticket on Malaysian Air. And landed in Sri Lanka none the worse for wear. I'm thinking of retiring from all my dirty deals. I'll see you in the next life, wake me up for meals."

""I'll take the mazuma"". Said Jesus to Marion. ""That's the 3:10 to Yuma. My ride's here..."". The Houston sky was changeless. We galloped through bluebonnets. I was wrestling with an angel. You were working on a sonnet. You said, ""I believe the seraphim. Will gather up my pinto. And carry us away, Jim. Across the San Jacinto. My ride's here..."". Shelley and Keats were out in the street. And even Lord Byron was leaving for Greece. While back at the Hilton, last but not least. Milton was holding his sides. Saying, ""You bravos had better be. ready to fight. Or we'll never get out of East Texas tonight. The trail is long and the river is wide. And my ride's here"". I was staying at the Westin. I was playing to a draw. When in walked Charlton Heston. With the Tablets of the Law. He said, ""It's still the Greatest Story"". I said, ""Man, I'd like to stay. But I'm bound for glory. I'm on my way. My ride's here...""."

Eating fried chicken with his regicidal friends. That's how the story ends. With a porcelain monkey. He threw it away for a porcelain monkey. Gave it all up for a figurine.

Dug in, hunkered down. Hours race without a sound. Gonna carry me to where I'm bound. Looking down on Prison Grove. Iron will hard as rock. Hold me up for the fateful knock. When they walk me down in a mortal lock. Out on Prison Grove. Shine on all these broken lives. Shine on. Shine the light on me. Knick Knack Paddy Wack. They say you'll hear your own bones crack. When they bend you back to bible black. Then you'll find your love. Some folks have to die too hard. Some folks have to cry too hard. Take one last look at the prison yard. Goodbye Prison Grove. Shine on all these broken lives. Shine on. Shine the light on me."

Quite ugly one morning. We all said goodnight. It came without a warning. Just a flash of light. Quite ugly one morning. We all said goodnight. It came without a warning.

rottweiler blues,"written by Warren Zevon and Carl Hiaasen. 1995 Zevon Music BMI. Got a Glock in the bedside table. Machine gun leaning by the bedroom door. Kevlar vest in the closet.

Don't knock on my door. If you don't know my Rottweiler's name. Halogen lights in the driveway. Guardian Angels living next door. One hundred pounds of unfriendly persuasion. Sleeping on the Florida porch. Slackers in the market. Bangers in the mall. Skinheads on the golf course. Hunting for their balls. If you come calling. He'll be mauling with intent to maim. Don't knock on my door. If you don't know my Rottweiler's name. Well, he's dreaming about an intruder or two. And the promise of burglar blood. He's yearning to chew on a gangster tattoo. And to hear the proverbial sickening thud. Shadows on the window. Rustling in the hedge. Faces at the peephole. Footsteps on the ledge. If you come calling. He'll be mauling with intent to maim. Don't knock on my door. If you don't know my Rottweiler's name."

things to do in denver when you're dead,"Written By LeRoy P. Marinell, Waddy Wachtel and Warren Zevon. c. 1991 Zevon Music administered by Warner-Tamerlane Publishing corp. LeadsheetlandBMI/Tiny Tunes ASCAP. I called up my friend LeRoy on the phone. I said, Buddy, I'm afraid to be alone. 'Cause I got some weird ideas in my head. About things to do in Denver when you're dead. I was working on a steak the other day. And I saw Waddy in the Rattlesnake Cafe. Dressed in black, tossing back a shot of rye. Finding things to do in Denver when you die. You won't need a cab to find a priest. Maybe you should find a place to stay. Some place where they never change the sheets. And you just roll around Denver all day. LeRoy says there's something you should know. Not everybody has a place to go. And home is just a place to hang your head. And dream of things to do in Denver when you're dead. You won't need a cab to find a priest. Maybe you should find a place to stay. Some place where they never change the sheets. And you just roll around Denver all day. You just roll around Denver all day."
transverse city,written by Stefan Arngrim & Warren Zevon 1989. Dark Victory Twins BMI/Zevon Music Inc. BMI. Told my little Pollyanna. There's a place for you and me. We'll go down to Transverse City. Life is cheap and Death is free. Past the condensation silos. Past the all-night trauma stand. We'll be there before tomorrow. Pollyanna take my hand. Show us endless neon vistas. Castles made of laser lights. Take us to the shopping sector. In the vortex of the night. Past the shiny mylar towers. Past the ravaged tenements. To a place we can't remember. For a time we won't forget. Here's the hum of desperation. Heres the test tube mating call. Here's the latest carbon cycle. Here's the clergy of the mall. Here's the song of shear and torsion. Here's the bloodbath magazine. Here's the harvest of contusions. Here's the narcoleptic dream. Told my little Pollyanna. Here's a place where we can stay. We have come to see tomorrow. We have given up today. Down among the dancing quanta. Everything exists at once. Up above in Transverse City. Every weekend lasts for months. Here's the hum of desperation. Heres the test tube mating call. Here's the latest carbon cycle. Here's the clergy of the mall. Here's the witness and the victim. Here's the relatives' remains. Here's the well-known double helix. Here's the poisoned waves of grain. Here's the song of shear and torsion. Here's the bloodbath magazine. Here's the harvest of contusions. Here's the narcoleptic dream. Here's the hum of desperation.

tule's blues,"c. Mr. Bones Music/BMI (1969? 1970?)c. 196 EMI-Capitol Music Special Markets. Oh Tule, it's on account of you that I've been weeping. Here behind my hand. It's lonesome in my heart's land, as the sands of the desert. Oh, tell me, why was it always you, who, through the changes. You, who always sang and played while the green vespers rang. In the heart of the hillside. It's a sad song we always seem to be singing to each other. You and me, sweet and slightly out of key. Like the sound of a running down calliope. Oh Tule, it's once I was your knight in golden armor. With the sun behind my hair. My music filled the air with symbols and lightning. Oh Tule, now can't you see I'm changing like the seasons?. My hair is growing dark. And there's no room left in the ark for a lark with a broken wing. It's a sad song we always seem to be singing to each other. And a child's voice, so tender and out of tune. Keeps a'praying I'll be singing home soon. Oh Tule, it's on account of you that I'll be leaving. 'Cross the deep salt sea. Whatever wild worlds I may see, will be empty without you. It's a sad song we always seem to be singing to each other. And a child's voice, so tender and out of tune. Keeps a'praying I'll be singing home soon."
