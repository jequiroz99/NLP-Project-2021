remembering sunday,"He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes. Started making his way past. Two in the morning. He hasn't been sober for days. Leaning now into the breeze. Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees. They had breakfast together. But two eggs don't last. Like the feeling of what he needs. Now this place seems familiar to him. She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin. She led him upstairs. She led him upstairs. Left him dying to get in. Forgive me, I'm trying to find my calling. I'm calling at night. I don't mean to be a bother, but have you seen this girl?. She's been running through my dreams. And it's driving me crazy, it seems. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. Even though she doesn't believe in love. He's determined to call her bluff. Who could deny these butterflies?. They're filling his gut. Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces. He pleads though he tries. But he's only denied. Now he's dying to get inside. Forgive me, I'm trying to find my calling. I'm calling at night. I don't mean to be a bother, but have you seen this girl?. She's been running through my dreams. And it's driving me crazy, it seems. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. The neighbor said she moved away. Funny how it rained all day. I didn't think much of it then. But it's starting to all make sense. Oh, I can see now. That all of these clouds are following me. In my desperate endeavor. To find my whoever. Wherever she may be. I'm not coming back. I've done something so terrible. I'm terrified to speak. But you'd expect that from me. I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt. Now the rain is just washing you out of my hair. And out of my mind. Keeping an eye on the world. So many thousands of feet off the ground. I'm over you now. I'm at home in the clouds. Towering over your head. I guess I'll go home now. I guess I'll go home now. I guess I'll go home now. I guess I'll go home"

Wipe the drive, clean-slate, quick, sound the alarm. No escape from the truth and the weight of it all. I am caught in the web of a lie. And the bitch of it all is that I'm running from. The desire of the people to whom I belong. At the end of the day you can tell me I'm wrong. Cause you went to all the trouble. Heart's on fire tonight. Feel my bones ignite. Feels like war, war.

a party song (the walk of shame),"I took a walk for the very first time. On the dark side of the dance floor. Lit a match just to heat things up. But I got more than I bargained for. Mixed drinks, mixed feelings of elation. I should have known it was a one-night invitation. Don't sweat it, forget it. Everything is a-okay. Just let it go then it's. Off to find another face. I'll make you come just to watch you leave. You walk around with my heart on your sleeve. Don't sweat it, it's over now. Our time ran out. I took an oath, but I'm giving it up. You didn't have to see things my way. Nothing more than a casual fuck. Isn't that just how we operate?. Let's drink to feelings of temptation. You and I, we're an overnight sensation. Don't sweat it, forget it. Everything is a-okay. Just let it, go then it's. Off to find another face. I'll make you come just to watch you leave. I walk around with your heart on my sleeve. Don't sweat it, it's over now. Our time ran. Outside, the brake light's started to dim. I feel the tension that's been pulling us in. And then we do it again. So we can feel all right. Falling in love for the night. Don't sweat it, forget it. Everything is a-okay. Just let it go then it's. Off to find another face. I'll make you come just to watch you leave.

good times,"On a fault line, late night. Underneath the stars we came alive. And singing to the sky just felt right. I won't forget the good times. While the punks started picking fights. With the skater kids under city lights. Remember how we laughed 'til we cried. I won't forget the good times. I never want to leave this sunset town. But one day the time may come. And I'll take you at your word and carry on. I'll hate the goodbye. But I won't forget the good times. I won't forget the good times. We were bare-knuckled, tight lip. Middle fingers up, ego trip. Devil may care but we didn't mind. I won't forget the good times. We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes. Chasing girls who didn't know love yet. As the bonfire moon came down. I won't forget the good times. I never want to leave this sunset town. But one day the time may come. And I'll take you at your word and carry on. I'll hate the goodbye. But I won't forget the good times. I won't forget the good times. Good times. I won't forget the good times. When we laughed. When we cried. Those were the days we owned the nights. Locked away. Lost in time. I found the nerve to say that. I never want to leave this sunset town. But one day the time may come. And I'll take you at your word and carry on. I'll hate the goodbye. But I won't forget the good times. I won't forget the good times. I won't forget the good times. I never want to leave this sunset town. But one day the time may come. And I'll take you at your word and carry on. I'll hate the goodbye. But I won't forget the good times. I won't forget the good times"

guts,"We're shooting for the stars. Desperately reaching for something in the dark. Pictures of memories, buried in my heart. Lie awake and dream of the endless possibilities. Catch my breath and go for it. Take apart. Everything that's holding me down. Make a point. To pick a new direction. To make a new connection. Is this what it feels like. Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything?. It feels like breaking out. When I can give up my reputation. Finally I can see honestly I've got the guts to say anything. Bold enough to fall flat on my face. When I walk as they crawl. Slowing down is just a waste of time to let go. Tapping my fingers to the rhythm of the metronome. Counting opportunities. Take apart. A gravity that's holding me down. Make a point. To find the resolution. To be my own solution. Is this what it feels like. Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything?. It feels like breaking out. When I can give up my reputation. Finally I can see honestly I've got the guts to say anything. Go down. Let me go. Let me go down alone. Let me go down, just let me go down. If I'm gonna go down, then just let me go. Let me go down, let me go down. Just let me go down, let me go. It feels like. Finding out that I've got the guts to say anything. Feels like breaking out. When I can give up my reputation. Finally I can see honestly I've got the guts to say anything.

remembering sunday,"He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes. Started making his way past. Two in the morning. He hasn't been sober for days. Leaning now into the breeze. Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees. They had breakfast together. But two eggs don't last. Like the feeling of what he needs. Now this place seems familiar to him. She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin. She led him upstairs. She led him upstairs. Left him dying to get in. Forgive me, I'm trying to find my calling. I'm calling at night. I don't mean to be a bother, but have you seen this girl?. She's been running through my dreams. And it's driving me crazy, it seems. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. Even though she doesn't believe in love. He's determined to call her bluff. Who could deny these butterflies?. They're filling his gut. Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces. He pleads though he tries. But he's only denied. Now he's dying to get inside. Forgive me, I'm trying to find my calling. I'm calling at night.

To find my whoever. Wherever she may be. I'm not coming back. I've done something so terrible. I'm terrified to speak. But you'd expect that from me. I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt. Now the rain is just washing you out of my hair. And out of my mind. Keeping an eye on the world. So many thousands of feet off the ground. I'm over you now. I'm at home in the clouds. Towering over your head. I guess I'll go home now. I guess I'll go home now. I guess I'll go home now. I guess I'll go home"

so long soldier,Back in 95. A little boy from just outside of London. Took a fated trip across the ocean. A little did he know. That he would find. His voice in verse and chorus. Making wishes on his broken stereo. Can't shake the noise from his bones. Hear it all play out in distant echoes. So long soldier. Cruise controller. Satellite trajectory. Guide us into reverie. And come down. To voice a generation. Late 2005. The boy's got plans. As crazy as his friends. They take their chance. Driving west alone. Give 'em six more years. And see what time will do. For hopeless dreamers. Singing wishes. To their broken stereo. You can't shake the noise. From their bones. Hear it all play out. In distant echoees. So long soldier. Cruise controller.

thanks to you,Thanks to you. Thanks to you. I'm moving on. Chasing out my skeletons. And the troubles they have caused. And all thanks to you. I'm turning over. The pages in this book of revelations. About self-medication. But there's this ringing in my head. (Who said it was gonna be easy). As the gost of you hangs over my bed. Thanks to you. I'm not myself. I'm all strung out. That much is clear. And I'll spend my. Whole life-time with your life-line. Wrapped around my throat. Thanks to you. All thanks to you. Thanks to you I've lost my touch. I struggle to find the sense. In making sense. And giving a semblance of a fuck. And thanks to you. For all the nightmares. There's not a night. That I sleep quiet and complacent. Without my medication. Cause there's this ringing in my head. (Who said it was gonna be easy). As the gost of you hangs over my bed. Thanks to you. I'm not myself. I'm all strung out. That much is clear. And I'll spend my.

the beach,"You're a long walk from my street. And I'm dying in this summer heat. I hope like hell you're waiting, waiting. Everybody's living like they're crazy in love. I'm a dizzy mess. And everything is so above me. From the formal kind of life I lead today. Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer. But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me.

And I'm coming clean. (Summer, do you feel me?). Just give me something. (Summer, do you feel me?). Stop pretending. Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer.

under a paper moon,"Baby, don’t yell,. You’re tearing a hole right through the walls of everything we used to know,. I’m building a place, something amazing,. Just for the sake of saving us,. From under the sun,. Two plastic hearts with nowhere to run,. We’re rolling the dice on whatever’s left,. ’cause God only knows that we could use the rest…. Me and you, living under a paper moon,. Cause real life just isn’t right; lets fabricate. Me and you, living under a paper moon,. This real life just isn’t right let’s get away let’s fabricate.. Baby, don’t fret,. At least we’re alive with just enough breath. to truly despise the hills in the carpet,. knots in the ties that bind us so tightly to our waking lives,. I’ll build up a house, I’ll build up an army. Of cellophane soliders cheap origami,. To take back a piece or whatever’s left. Of that little box that beats in your chest. Me and you, living under a paper moon,. Cause real life just isn’t right; lets fabricate. Me and you, living under a paper moon,. This real life just isn’t right let’s get away let’s fabricate.. I’m building a place,. something amazing just for the sake of saving us,. And whatever’s left of that little box that beats in your chest. Me and you, living under a paper moon,. Cause real life just isn’t right; lets fabricate. Me and you, living under a paper moon,. This real life just isn’t right let’s get away. This real life, just isn’t right, let’s fabricate"
vegas,"Tonight we lie awake. Remember how the coffee made us shake. On those long drives?. One more long night. Another seven days. Heartbeat racing. The interstate, my home tonight. For one more long night. I'm sure as hell the happiest I've ever been. We can't hide, we let go. We've got more than we know. My friends are a different breed. My friends are.... There's a ghost in this room. I think I'll name it after all of you. And watch it hang over my bed like decorations. Celebrate it. Memories that came and went. And a lot of all that time we spent. Listening to everything our parents told us not to take in. Now make a change. I'm counting down. The mile marks to every town. And falling more in love. With the distance put between us. We can't hide, we let go. We've got more than we know. My friends are a different breed. My friends are everything. Make this last, take it slow. We've got it all figured out for now. So let us live our lives without a doubt. Tonight we lie awake. Remember how the coffee made us shake. On those long drives?. One more long night. Another seven days. Heartbeat racing. The interstate, my home tonight. For one more long night. From coast to coast. I'll make the most. Of every second I've been giving with this crowd. Without a doubt. You're all I dream about. At night we lie awake. With stories taking us back to the nights we felt alive. To the nights we felt alive. The nights we felt alive. I would've married you in Vegas. Had you given me the chance to say ""I do"". Couldn't make it anymore obvious. Could you be anymore obvious?. I would've married you in Vegas. Had you given me the chance to say ""I do"". Couldn't make it anymore obvious, could you?. Be anymore obvious, could you?"
walls,"Hey, there its good to see you again. It never felt right. Calling this ""just friends"",. I'm happy, if you're happy with yourself. Take off your shirt, your shoes. Those skinny jeans I bought for you. We're diving in. There's nothing left to lose. I'm gonna break down these walls. I built around myself. I wanna fall so in love. With you and no one else. Could ever mean half as much. To me as you do now. Together we'll move on. Just don't turn around. Let the walls break down. I used to wear you like a ball and chain. I'd run and hide at the call of my name. It was obvious that you were too much for me. Oblivious, I was young and horny. In retrospect, I wouldn't do it again. Stop talking shit to every one of your friends. I'm not the same boy you knew back then... 'Cause I can break down these walls. I built around myself. I wanna fall so in love. With you and no one else. Could ever mean half as much. To me as you do now. Together we'll move on. Just don't turn around. Let the walls break down. I can't breathe, my body's shaking. You've got a way with the way you take me. 'Cause you break me down. you know you break me down..."
we all fall down,Cut my wrists and pull away. wake me up in time to hear you say. I can't say it is no more. Don't go please stay. I'll beg for one last day. There's so much more I have to learn from you. I swear I'll miss you when you're gone. We all fall down. But you refuse to get back on your feet again. You closed your eyes. and said goodbye to all of those who loved you. And as you tried to break this strength. What happens never seems to have an end. you couldn't stay no more. And as you took your final breath. Would your dreams come forth or have an end. Did you fade away?. There's so much more i have to learn from you. The past will miss you now you're gone. We all fall down. But you refuse to get back on your feet again. you closed your eyes. and said goodbye to all of those who loved you
we say summer,"I have seen millions of faces,. ever-unchanging; content with redundancy,. I'm not the same way;. searching for change in directions that I want to go.. Take a breath, let it out slow,. Seasons change with the break of a lifetime,. Remind me again why we thought twice about it,. We've got ambition like you've got restraint so,. Smile like you don't give a damn about the consequence,. just say anything,. We say summer holds such wonderful things.. This must be more than just built up suspense,. In the wake of an accident.. Twist and turn in my sleep,. wake me up when we get there;. Destination success.. Run like hell - We make noise for the sake of escaping.. Run like hell - You only live once now take this to heart.. Tell my family and friends I'll be ok.. Smile like you don't give a damn about the consequence /. just say anything / We say summer holds such wonderful things:"
weightless,"Manage me, I'm a mess.. Turn a page, I'm a book half unread.. I want to be laughed at, laughed with, just because. I want to feel weightless. and that should be enough.. But I'm stuck in this fucking rut,. Waiting on a second hand pick-me-up. And I'm over getting older. If I could just find the time. Then I would never let another day go by. I'm over getting old.. Maybe it's not my weekend, but it's gonna be my year.. I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass. As I go nowhere. And this is my reaction. To everything I fear. 'Cause I've been going crazy,. I don't want to waste another minute here.. Make believe. That I impress. That every word. By design turns a head. I wanna feel reckless,. Wanna live it up,. Just because. I want to feel weightless,. 'Cause that would be enough.. If I could just find the time. Then I would never let another day go by. I'm over getting old. Maybe it's not my weekend,. But it's gonna be my year. I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass. As I go nowhere,. And this is my reaction. To everything I fear. 'Cause I've been going crazy,. I don't want to waste another minute here. This could be all I've waited for. This could be everything and I don't want to dream anymore. Maybe it's not my weekend. But it's gonna be my year. And I've been going crazy. I'm stuck in here.... Maybe it's not my weekend,. But it's gonna be my year. I'm so sick of. Watching while the minutes pass. As I go nowhere. This is my reaction. To everything I fear. 'Cause I've been going crazy. I don't want to waste another minute here"
your bed,"Where are you now. I'm a fool for asking. But I let you under my skin. And I, I've never been the same again. So don't ask me how. I keep myself together. Cuz I'm hardly together. And I gladly surrender. But I, I can't find the nerve to say it's alright. I can't find the nerve to say I miss you more. Then anybody should. So take me to your bed. And we can mess around. Like we never meant anything we said. I need you to feel again. Don't mess around. Just let me in. And take me to your bed. So take me to your bed. (Just let me in). (And take me to your bed).
