temple of the king,"One day in the year of the fox. Came a time remembered well. When the strong young man of the rising sun. Heard the tolling of the great black bell. One day in the year of the fox. When the bell began to ring. Meant the time had come. For one to go. To the temple of the king. There in the middle of the circle he stands. Searching, seeking. With just one touch of his trembling hand. The answer will be found. Daylight waits while the old man sings. Heaven help me. And then like the rush of a thousand wings. It shines upon the one. And the day had just begun. One day in the year of the fox. Came a time remembered well. When the strong young man of the rising sun. Heard the tolling of the great black bell. One day in the year of the fox. When the bell began to sing. It meant the time had cometh. For one to go. To the temple of the king. There in the middle of the people. He stands. Seeing, feeling. With just a wave of a strong right hand. He's gone. To the temple of the king. Far from the circle at the edge of the world. He's hoping, wondering. Thinking back from the stories he's heard. Of what he's going to see. There in middle of the circle it lies. Heaven help me. Then all could see by the shine in his eyes. The answer had been found. Back with the people in the circle. He stands. Giving, feeling. With just one touch of a strong right hand. They know. Of the temple and the king"

black sheep of the family,"I've got nothing in my head, got a floor for a bed.. My future's at the bottom of a teacup. I've got half a pair of shoes and no time to lose.. I'm wondering when I'm gonna wise up. So, fortune, shine your light on me and my nose,. Cause I need some security.. You get a little bad luck and it grows and it grows.. I'm the black sheep of the family.. I've got half a pound of rice, a beard full of lice,. Political retrogression.. I've got a pocket full of dust, and eating is a must. If you want to make a good impression.. So, fortune shine your light on me and my dog,. Cause we need some security.. While other folks are living high on the hog.. I'm the black sheep of the family.. Don't talk to me about society.. You got to play by the rules or pay the penalty.. Because there's nothing to choose between a handful of blues.. Double indemnity.. The whole world's wrong and my shadow's getting long.. I realize this song don't mean much.. I got an ache in my head. I want to go to bed.. Tomorrow I don't have to wake up.. So, wisdom shine your light on me and my knees.. It's true what they say about familiarity.. There's nothing good this way, it's true what they say!. I'm the black sheep of the family."

We'll go to that forbidden land. Of our black masquerade. Let the darkness surround you. The game that we play is the black masquerade. Release all the madness within, let it all begin. We'll go to that forbidden land. Come let me take you there. Let the moonlight surround you. Don't be afraid, it's the black masquerade."
black sheep of the family,"I've got nothing in my head, got a floor for a bed.. My future's at the bottom of a teacup. I've got half a pair of shoes and no time to lose.. I'm wondering when I'm gonna wise up. So, fortune, shine your light on me and my nose,. Cause I need some security.. You get a little bad luck and it grows and it grows.. I'm the black sheep of the family.. I've got half a pound of rice, a beard full of lice,. Political retrogression.. I've got a pocket full of dust, and eating is a must. If you want to make a good impression.. So, fortune shine your light on me and my dog,. Cause we need some security.. While other folks are living high on the hog.. I'm the black sheep of the family.. Don't talk to me about society.. You got to play by the rules or pay the penalty.. Because there's nothing to choose between a handful of blues.. Double indemnity.. The whole world's wrong and my shadow's getting long.. I realize this song don't mean much.. I got an ache in my head. I want to go to bed.. Tomorrow I don't have to wake up.. So, wisdom shine your light on me and my knees.. It's true what they say about familiarity.. There's nothing good this way, it's true what they say!. I'm the black sheep of the family."

bye bye baby goodbye,"Bye Bye Baby Goodbye Lyrics. Whooaaa. I get the same old dream, same time every night. Fall to the ground and I wake up. So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head. - Thoughts fly back to the break-up. These four walls are closing in. Look at the fix you've put me in!!. Chorus:. Since You've Been Gone, Since You've Been Gone. I'm outta my head, Can't take it. Could I be wrong, but Since You've Been Gone. You cast the spell, so break it. Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh. Since You've Been Gone. So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light. I read the words that you sent to me. I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon. - You can't know what you mean to me. Your poison letter, your telegram. Just goes to show you don't give a damn. CHORUS. If you will come back. Baby you know. You'll never do wrong. CHORUS 2X"

can't let you go,Day after day I keep waking up. To find that you're slipping away. Night after night. I can't fight the emptiness inside. Nothing I can say. Now I know you're turning me away. You're wearing a disguise. You don't have to hide cause. The truth is in your eyes tonight. I don't want to live a lie. But I don't want to say goodbye. And I can't let you go even though it's over. I just can't let you go. Though your love is growing colder. One look in my eyes and you'd realize. That you got my heart in your hands. Won't you let me know something more. Where did we go wrong?. I don't want to fight. All I want to do is try to understand. I'm reaching out for you babe. What can I do. I've been holding on so long. I don't want to live a lie. But I don't want to say goodbye. I can't let you go. Even though it's over. I just can't let you go. I feel your love is growing colder. I don't want to live a lie. But I don't want to say goodbye. I want you by my side. And I can't let you go. Even though it's over. I just can't let you go. I feel your love is growing colder
catch the rainbow,When evening falls. She'll run to me. Like whispered dreams. Your eyes can't see. Soft and warm. She'll touch my face. A bed of straw. Against the lace. * we believed we'd catch the rainbow. Ride the wind to the sun. Sail away on ships of wonder. But life's not a wheel. With chains made of steel. So bless me come the dawn. Come the dawn
cold hearted woman,"[Blackmore/White]. She came from across the water. A devil's daughter was in disguise. I crid for mercy - she bound and chained me. and then she played me, I was mesmerized. When she gave me blood red roses. They were wrapped in razor thorns. She was sly in her temptation. Then she left me on my own. Sutch a cold hearted woman. She promised passion everlasting. And now I'm haunted by her name. I gave up all that I ever cared for. Oh if I only had my yesterdays again. I've been blinded, now I'm broken. Sometimes I can hear her song. No man's grass was ever greener. Now I find that I don't belong. With a cold hearted woman. She touched my world and I was shaken. But she was fakin,?I never knew. These days are colder and there's no shoulder. I'm just the shell fo the man I was before. If there's somewhere I can run to. Till I kill the pain inside. I've been walking now for hours. Can't forget her, the Lord knows I've tried. Cause she's a cold, cold hearted woman."
danger zone,"Shaking off the tresholds of a long forgotten dream. And you just can't make it last. Coaching paradise on a personal line. But you get fired to fast. And you lie, memories drifting by. Love don't make it on those pin-striped nights. When you're looking through someone's disguise. You can't make it alone, so you gotta make a move. But you're looking at nobody's eyes. Well that's love, or maybe love come and go. Looking for love is a danger zone. Love don't go begging in the danger zone. You won't get nothing from the danger zone. Tales that you tell from the stories that you'll hear. And you'll get what you can while you may. Don't understand when you're looking for a dame. But it's only a heartbreak away. And you'll learn, faking has no return. No way when you're feeling that way. Will your feet get caught up in the crowd. And the song that you sing is too soft to be heard. But your speakers are way too loud. Like the pain, loving is no big game. Looking for love is a danger zone. No don't go living in the danger zone. You won't get nothing from the danger zone. Don't take no chances in the danger zone. Love don't go begging in the danger zone. No don't go living in the danger zone. You won't get nothing from the danger zone. Don't take no chances in the danger zone."

lady of the lake,There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground. Makin' it shiver and shake. And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky. Slippery and sly like a snake. With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth. A shadow has covered the light. Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade. Has shattered the edge of the night. I know she waits below. Only to rise on command. When she comes for me. She's got my life in her hands. When a movement behind hit the side of my mind. I trembled and shook it away. Then another assault and I started to faulter. Fibres of steel turned to clay. With a bubbly turn now the water should churn. And push it way from the core. And a lady in white will bring sun to the night. Brighter than ever before. I know she waits below. Only to rise on command. When she comes for me. She's got my life in her hands. Lady of the lake. There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground. Makin' it shiver and shake. And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky. Slippery and sly like a snake. With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth. A shadow has covered the light. Then a beam in the shade from a slivery blade. Has shattered the edge of the night. Straight down I'm swirling around. Blinded and bruised by the strain. There must be some way to see. Diamonds out of the rain. I know she waits below. Only to rise on command. When she comes for me. She's got my life in her hands.

Silence of love. You say you need someone to hold you. You say that you're feeling afraid. I know the worst part of being alone. Is a book full of nombers with no one to phone. That's the silence of love.

No more night. We have seen the light. Let it shine on bright. Hang him higher.

still i'm sad,"See the stars come fallin' down the sky. Gently passing. They kiss your tear drops dry. See the wind come, softly blow. Your hair from your face. And the rain comes falling down. In its crazy way. Still I'm sad. For myself my tears just fall in the dust. As I search in the night and find they're lost. See the wind come gently blow. Time into my heart. And the rain comes falling down. While we're apart. Still I'm sad"

You were standing by my side. I've seen your face before tonight. Maybe I just see what I want it to be. I know it's a mystery. Do you remember me on a street of dreams. Running through my memory.

temple of the king,"One day in the year of the fox. Came a time remembered well. When the strong young man of the rising sun. Heard the tolling of the great black bell. One day in the year of the fox. When the bell began to ring. Meant the time had come. For one to go. To the temple of the king. There in the middle of the circle he stands. Searching, seeking. With just one touch of his trembling hand. The answer will be found. Daylight waits while the old man sings. Heaven help me. And then like the rush of a thousand wings. It shines upon the one. And the day had just begun. One day in the year of the fox. Came a time remembered well. When the strong young man of the rising sun. Heard the tolling of the great black bell. One day in the year of the fox. When the bell began to sing. It meant the time had cometh. For one to go. To the temple of the king. There in the middle of the people. He stands. Seeing, feeling. With just a wave of a strong right hand. He's gone. To the temple of the king. Far from the circle at the edge of the world. He's hoping, wondering. Thinking back from the stories he's heard. Of what he's going to see. There in middle of the circle it lies. Heaven help me. Then all could see by the shine in his eyes. The answer had been found. Back with the people in the circle. He stands. Giving, feeling. With just one touch of a strong right hand. They know. Of the temple and the king"

too late for tears,"[Blackmore/White/Regan]. Well I'm moving faster close to the edge. As I smoka a pack of strong cigarettes. When my fears run dry, you won't see me cry. Coz I know I got it coming. We touched the sun and went on our way. And we asked the stars to come out to play. But you said good night when they lost their light. And my world stopped spinning `round. What are we fighting for. Dontcha know that no one wins. What are we fighting for. Just give up and I'll give in. It's too late for tears. When the things you need are things you don't want. And you take the needle right to the point. I'd be heaven bound, but you shoot me down. Leave me broke and bleeding on the killing floor."
wolf to the moon,"[Blackmore/White/Night]. With a rebel mind and a gypsy heart. No place could ever be home. Drawn like a wolf to the moon it calls to my soul. Ain't got no woman, they just tie me down. Freedom is my only friend. I get a feeling destiny lies 'round the bend. One for the road. Slave to the highway. King of the road. Chasing the sun as it sets in the sky. Swear that I'll catch it someday. Lights of the city behind are fadingg away. Makin' my way through the names on the map. No point in feeling alone. As long as I ride the open road I'll always have a home. One for the road. Slave to the highway. King of the road. My future is calling a cry in the wind. Leading me out of my past. Got no destination but know that I'm getting there fast. Crossed many miles got so many to go. Each one calling my name. Won't settle down and you know I'll never be tamed. One for the road. Slave to the highway. King of the road."
