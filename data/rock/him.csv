funeral of hearts,"Love's the funeral of hearts. And anode for cruelty. When angels cry blood. On flowers of evil in bloom. The funeral of hearts. And a plea for mercy. When love is a gun.

And ode for cruelty. When angels cry blood. On flowers of evil in bloom. The funeral of hearts. And a plea for mercy. When love is a gun. Separating me from you. She was the wind, carrying in.

A prayer to a god who's deaf and blind. The last rites for souls on fire. Three little words and a question why. Love's the funeral of hearts. And ode for cruelty. When angels cry blood. On flowers of evil in bloom. The funeral of hearts. And a plea for mercy. When love is a gun. Separating me from you"

Shedding skin to a dying song,. We hum along to the evening sun til we are no more. little deaths to a dying song,. Sound a lot like -- life and love,. Life and love,. With you. Crawl back into bed tomorrows trembling. At the sight of you and I,. Shedding skin to a dying song. We hum along to the evening sun til we are no more. little deaths to a dying song,.

passion's killing floor,It’s poetry carved in flesh. This beautiful hell of ours. To the deadliest sin we confess. And tears of joy fill our eyes. We are safe where disfigured saints. Cry out their prophecies of doom. My heart’s a graveyard baby. And to evil we make love. On our passion’s killing floor. In my arms you won’t sleep safely. And of lust we are reborn. On our passion’s killing floor. At the first kiss the seeds of hatred are sown. And back into darkness we flee to tear our hearts out. We are safe where all faiths fail. Alive inside of our tomb

bleed well,"You had demons to kill within you screaming. With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes. Love preys the living and praises the dead. In the heart of our hearts by death we were wed. Bleed well the soul you're about to sell for passion deranged. Kiss and tell, baby we're bleeding well. Bleed well the heart you're about to fail for reasons insane. Kill and tell, baby we're bleeding well'. 'In hell. 'No love lost under her will', I heard you weeping. And on those words a church was built to keep the pain in. If death is the answer to love's mysteries. Then bleed on my darling to the sound of a dream"

Looking for a way to disappear for a moment from our deepest fears. I'll be drowning you in this river of gloom. Forever in my heart"

drunk on shadows,Hiding underneath. The veil of broken dreams. We find her weeping. On her once white wings. She will be carrying the weight of our deeds. And she bleeds for love. Forever gone. Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie. Killing ourselves a kiss at a time. Devils dance while angels smile. Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie. Finding souls to feed. The nightside of eden. We see her struggling. For her love's. Last breath and walk off. Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie. Killing ourselves a kiss at a time. Devils dance while angels smile. Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie. She's blinded by the fear. Of life and death and everything in between. We smile when she cries a river of tears. A mirror where we see nothing but a reflection of heaven too far away. Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie. Killing ourselves a kiss at a time. Devils dance while angels smile. Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie. So alive. (Drunk on shadows). So alive
dying song,"I've seen you breathe life into the weakest of hearts,. And heard you scream out loud the sweetest poem,. Echo across the ocean reminding me. Why I still try,. To hold onto whatever is left of you and I,. Shedding skin to a dying song,. We hum along to the evening sun till we are no more,. Little deaths to a dying song,. Sound a lot like life,. I've seen these dreams be crushed by a single thought,. And felt the envy of sadness engulf all warmth. Barely alive under ice by exchanging sighs,. With tomorrow quivering in the loneliest light,. Shedding skin to a dying song,. We hum along to the evening sun til we are no more. little deaths to a dying song,. Sound a lot like -- life and love,. Life and love,. With you. Crawl back into bed tomorrows trembling. At the sight of you and I,. Shedding skin to a dying song. We hum along to the evening sun til we are no more. little deaths to a dying song,. Sound a lot like -- life and love,. Life and love,. Life and love,. (Dying Song). Life and love,. (Dying Song). With you,. (Dying Song). With you,. (Dying Song). With you,. (Dying Song). With you,.

endless dark,Softly the light shines in through. The gates of grace on me and you. Deceiving our restless hearts. A flickering flame so serene. Devours the night so we could see. The fear we hold on to so strong. But I know where I belong. Away from your gods. That heal all wounds and light. This endless dark. Endless dark. This endless Dark. Lonely the light shines on you. Through the gates of fire entombed. Feeding on your love. Weak is the blaze that kept me away. From cruelty and tenderness embraced. Saving my soul no more. And I know where I belong.

That worship the tomb of our forlorn love. That heal all wounds and light. This endless dark. That heal all wounds and light. This endless dark.

A prayer to a god who's deaf and blind. The last rites for souls on fire. Three little words and a question why. Love's the funeral of hearts. And ode for cruelty. When angels cry blood. On flowers of evil in bloom. The funeral of hearts. And a plea for mercy. When love is a gun. Separating me from you"

in the nightside of eden,"Divided we stand in light of a frozen sun. Cursing the gods we have become. We steal the fire from the sacred heart. And bleed the wine unholy. We fall in love with the serpent's song. And feel nothing. In the nightside of Eden, we're born again, dead. Forever we are, forever we've been. Forever we'll be crucified to a dream. In the nightside of Eden. Deranged, we're tearing away the pedals of desire. Learning the mathematics of evil by heart. We deceive ourselves to start a war. Within the realm of senses. And descend to the circle number four. Where we are nothing. In the nightside of Eden, we're born again, dead. Forever we are, forever we've been. Forever we'll be crucified to a dream. In the nightside of Eden. In the nightside of Eden, we're born again, dead. Forever we are, forever we've been. Forever we'll be crucified to a dream. In the nightside of eden.

into the night,"Trapped in autumn, buried beneath the leaves. To the echo of the summer softly weeping. Sinking further in this seminary sea. Painting pain with pastels through her cemetery eyes. Into the night we ride, scars wide open. Into the night (into the night) , you and I torn and broken. Bleed into the night. Blinded by the sun's brightest rays. Lading you two from the sharpened razor blades (razor blades). Side by side; darkness and light. Play their game so unafraid, their hearts in synchronized. Into the night we ride, scars wide open. Into the night (into the night) , you and I torn and broken. Bleed into the night and I'll meet you there. Waiting for the world to end. Oh let it end again. Into the night we ride, scars wide open. Into the night (into the night) , you and I torn and broken. Bleed into the night (into the night, into the night) , arms wide open. Will you leave me there?"

love's requiem,Confusion writhes around our hearts. Impatiently. It drains the faith that lights the dark. And sets us free. From the chains of our war and the pain we once called. Love. The poison of doubt enslaves our minds. And we bleed. We abandon the trust that kept us blind. And disappear. Under the crimson wings of hate. Where the lost are safe until they love. Again. The heart of darkness is hope. Of finding you there. And that hope will be our. Love’s requiem. We pray to the serpent of delight. Desperately. The questions are answered and we try. Not to weep. Until we are sure. We’re suffering for. Love. In the dungeon of our dreams. We’re so weak. The promise made to be broken still. Haunts our sleep. We won’t open our eyes. Afraid we would die for love. Again. The heart of darkness is hope. Of finding you there. And that hope will be our. Love’s requiem. The salvation we seek will be waiting us there. In the heart of darkness lonely and scared. With a promise of death for our love. For our love. And now that we’re free. From the chains of our dear love. I’m lost - so lost. The heart of darkness is hope. Of finding you there. And that hope will be our. Love’s requiem. Take me into your arms. And sing me your beautiful song. Hold me until we’re one. And sing me your beautiful song. The heart of darkness is hope. Of finding you there. And that hope will be our. Love’s requiem.

passion's killing floor,It’s poetry carved in flesh. This beautiful hell of ours. To the deadliest sin we confess. And tears of joy fill our eyes. We are safe where disfigured saints. Cry out their prophecies of doom. My heart’s a graveyard baby. And to evil we make love. On our passion’s killing floor. In my arms you won’t sleep safely. And of lust we are reborn. On our passion’s killing floor. At the first kiss the seeds of hatred are sown. And back into darkness we flee to tear our hearts out. We are safe where all faiths fail. Alive inside of our tomb
play dead,A moth into a butterfly. And a lie. Into the sweetest truth. I'm so afraid of life. I try. To call your name but I'm. Silenced by the fear of dying in your heart once again. I see the seasons changing. And in the heart of this autumn I fall. With the leaves from the trees. I play dead. To hide my heart. Until the world gone dark fades away. I cry. Like God cries the rain. And I'm just one step away from the end of today. I see the reasons changing. And in the warmth of the past I crawl. Scorched by the shame. I play dead. To hide my heart. Until the world gone dark fades away. I stay dead. Until you veil my scars and say goodbye to fate. Before it's too late. . Paty

poison girl,I did it all just for her. I did it all just for her. And love's heart is death. For me and my poison girl. A prey she was for the cruelty of love. While its serpent inside crawled.

serpent ride (demo),"Upon the wings of a dream she rides. Close she comes to me, fills me with light. Towards the dark side of the moon we fly. She sings me a tune, away through the silver starlight. I don't want to wake up this time. I'm alive on this serpent ride. In the grace of our love we writhe in pain. Further into this solar fog mesmerised. A drop of her blood tastes like wine. I answer her call with a rhyme:. “that is not dead which can eternal lie. yet with strange aeons death may die”. [H.P.Lovecraft]. In your eyes lies the world where I don't wanna go. Said you’ve changed but I don't believe in miracles. Since you conquered my heart we’ve never been apart. One day we'll close our eyes, open them again. And discover each other. So I open up my eyes. She treats me with a smile. From her wrists flows wine"

sleepwalking past hope,I hid the keys to unlock love's heart. To hold you in my sweetest pain and suffering. Everything's unfair in our lust and war. Redemption beyond right and wrong. In our hearts love keeps sweet-talking to despair. And goes on sleepwalking past hope. All is lost in this war. And all we can do is to wail and weep to the saddest song. Sleepwalking past hope. I unlit the light to embrace the dark. To be near but not to turn into you my darling. Forever we're lost in our souls' storm. Reflections of each other's faults. I gave up long ago. Painting love with crimson flow. Ran out of blood and hope. So I paint you no more. My hell begins from the 10th and descends to the circle. Six hundred threescore and six. And from there I crawl beneath Lucifer's claws just for one last kiss

There's nothing you can do. I've lost my faith in you. You did not look at the fire. I've lost my faith, it's true. And it has become our funeral pyre. I spread my wings for you. Heaven, let your gate be open. I'll let you in with venomous kisses. My love in its own cruelty. Listen to my, listen to my heart. To my, listen to my heart. Listen to my heart, you'll hear it sing, aah aah aah ah. A song of returning to heaven through my poison sting, aa aah aah aah ah. aaahh aaah aaah aah. Oh, listen to my heart, you'll hear it sing, aah aah aah ah. A song of returning to heaven through my poison sting, aah aah aah ah. Listen to my heart, you'll hear it sing, la la la la la la aah. A song of returning to heaven through my poison sting, aah aah aah ah. Listen to my heart, you'll hear it sing, aah aah aah ah. A song of returning to heaven through my poison sting, aah aah aah ah. Listen to my heart, you'll hear it sing, la la la la la la aah. A song of returning to heaven through my poison sting, aah aah aah ah"
the sacrament,"I hear you breathe so far from me. I feel your touch so close and real. And I know. My church is not of silver and gold,. Its glory lies beyond judgment of souls. The commandments are of consolation and warmth. You know our sacred dream won't fail. The sanctuary tender and so frail. The sacrament of love. The sacrament of warmth is true. The sacrament is you. I hear you weep so far from here. I taste your tears like you're next to me. And I know. My weak prayers are not enough to heal. The ancient wounds so deep and so dear. The revelation is of hatred and fear. You know our sacred dream won't fail. The sanctuary tender and so frail. The sacrament of love. The sacrament of warmth is true. The sacrament is you. The sacrament is you. The sacrament is you. The sacrament is you. The sacrament is you. You know our sacred dream won't fail. The sanctuary tender and so frail. The sacrament of love. The sacrament of warmth is true. The sacrament is you. You know our sacred dream won't fail. The sanctuary tender and so frail. The sacrament of love. The sacrament of warmth is true. The sacrament is you"
the vampire,"When I was born shadow comin' into your life.... The dark side of your sun... coming to. Every day sin is deeper in your heart. Screaming souls, deeper and deeper.... Come in me like a knife on my skin. But you can... never die... never die. Run away, take another falling love. Make my way, fire burning my desire. Every tear... you'll cry. Every day... I'll die. With my blood you can survive. And we live forever... into hell.... On my blood now you are free. Like a scream fly to me. Simil dreams and flying like an angel. But we fall always into hell... into hell. Run away, take another falling love. Make my way, fire burning my desire. Every tear... you'll cry. Every day... I'll die. With my blood you can survive. And we live forever... into hell.... By Guinooby"

too happy to be alive,We're still breathing. This can't be love. Baby we're trying. Shed a few tears more. We keep on running. Just to get caught. And we know what this is. Exactly what it wants. *Chorus*. We fear for the best. And hope for the worst. (Too happy to be alive). With loves light blessed. And loves light cursed. (Too happy to be alive). Now we feel it coming. Piercing our hearts. Fingers crossed and we're praying. That nothing goes wrong. And finally it's happening. Just a knock on our door. Our hearts are beating. Oh it's just begun. *Chorus*. Too happy. Too happy. And we're too happy to be alive. Too happy. Too happy. And we're too happy to be alive. Too happy. Too happy. 'Cos we're too happy to be alive. My love
under the rose,I dream of the winter in my heart. Turning to spring. While the ice gives way. Under my feet. And so I drown with the sun. I've been burning in water. And drowning in flame. To prove you wrong and scare you away. I admit my defeat and want back home. In your heart under the rose. I open my eyes with a sigh of relief. As the warmth of summer's sunlight. Dances around me. And I see you with dead leaves in your hands. I've been burning in water. And drowning in flame. To prove you wrong and scare you away. I admit my defeat and want back home. In your heart under the rose. I've been burning in water. And drowning in flame. To prove you wrong and scare you away. I admit my defeat and want back home. In your heart under the rose. I've been burning in water. And drowning in flame. To prove you wrong and scare you away. I admit my defeat and want back home. In your heart under the rose. In your heart under the rose. In your heart under the rose. In your heart under the rose
vampire heart,"You can't escape the wrath of my heart. Beating to your funeral song. All faith is lust for hell regained. and love dust in the hands of shame. Let me bleed you this song of my heart deformed. and lead you along this path in the dark. Where I belong until I feel your warmth. Hold me like you held onto life when. All fears came alive and entombed me. And love me like you loved the sun,. Scorching the blood in my vampire heart. I'll be the thorns in every rose. you've been sent by hope. I am the nightmare waking you up, from the dream of a dream of love. Let me weep you this poeam as heaven's. gates close. and paint you my soul, scarred and alone. waiting for your kisses to take me back home. by vii!"
venus (in our blood),Her Heaven's a lie to those who threw away the key. Her God is alive and well when the higher believes. And you can't bend the river of her dreams. Or understand the divine words she speaks. Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters. You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day. Venus denies you in your dark waters. The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood. Her savior was never on a cross peirced with nails. Thirty peices of silver never retraced her mistake. She'll always be free from the arms of your sins. That made you weak as your world started crumbling. Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters. You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day. Venus denies you in your dark waters. The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood. (She's in our blood). Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters. You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day. The venus denies you in your dark waters. The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood. In our blood. In our blood. In our blood. (She's in our blood). Enviada por Cachopa666
venus doom,Leave all behind now to watch her crawl. Through our dark gardens of insanity. She’ll be the light to guide you back home. Just give her a kiss worth dying for. And open your arms. Watch me fall for you my venus doom. Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed. My venus doom. All dreams are of you. My venus doom. Grieve all your hearts out and she’ll writhe enthralled. In tragic ecstatic agony. And in her flames we will die some more. Just show me a life worth living for. And light up the dark. Hold me inside your infernal offering. Touch me as I fall. Don’t lose yourself in this suffering yet. Hold on
when love and death embrace,I'm in love with you. And it's crushing my heart. All I want is you. To take me into your arms. When love and death embrace. I love you. And you're crushing my heart. I need you. Please take me into your arms. When love and death embrace. When love and death embrace. When love and death embrace. When love and death embrace
