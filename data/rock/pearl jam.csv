While the palms in the breeze still blow green. And the waves in the sea still absolute blue. But the horror. Every single thing I see is a reminder of her. Never thought I'd curse the day I met her. And since she's gone and wouldn't hear. Who would care? what good would that do?. But I'm still here. So I imagine in a month... or 12. I'll be somewhere having a drink. Laughing at a stupid joke. Or just another stupid thing. And I can see myself stopping short. Drifting out of the present. Sucked by the undertow and pulled out deep. And there I am, standing. Wet grass and white headstones all in rows. And in the distance there's one, off on its own. So I stop, kneel. My new home.... And I picture a sober awakening,. A re-entry into this. Little bar scene. Sip my drink til the ice hits my lip. Order another round. And that's it for now,. Sorry.. Never been too good at happy endings..."

immortality,"Vacate is the word. Vengeance has no place so near to her. Cannot find the comfort in this world. Artificial tear. Vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers?. Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere.

He was guiding me, love, his own way. Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow. As the curtain comes down. I feel that this is just g'bye for now"

But I see through your eyes, and I see through your brain. Like I see through the water that runs down my drain. You that fasten all the triggers, for the others to fire. Then you sit back and watch, while the death count. gets higher. You hide in your mansion, while young people's blood. Flows out their bodies and is buried in the mud. You've thrown the worst fear, that could ever be. hurled. The fear to bring children, into this world. For threatenin' my baby, unborn and unnamed. You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins. How much do I know, to talk out of turn?. You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm. unlearned. But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you. Even Jesus would never forgive what you do. Let me ask you one question, is your money that good?. Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it. could?. Oh, I think you will find, when your death takes its toll. All the money you made will never buy back your soul. And I hope that you die, and your death will come soon. I'll follow your casket, in the pale afternoon. And I'll watch as you're lowered, into your deathbed. And I'll stand on your grave till I'm sure that you're dead"

sad,All the photographs were peeling. And colors turned to gray. He stayed... in his room with memories for days. He faced... an undertow of futures laid to waste. Embraced... by the loss of what he could not replace. There is no reason that she passed. And there is no god with a plan. It's sad... and his loneliness is proof. It's sad... he could only love you. It's sad. The door swings to a passing fable. A fate we may delay. We say... holding on...delivered in our own brace. He let ‘em as he laid in bed. H oping that dreams would bring her back. It's sad... and his loneliness is proof. It's sad... he could only love you. It's sad. Holding his last breath. Believing... he'll make his way. But she's not forgotten. He's haunted...he's searching for escape. If just one wish could bring her back. It's sad... and his loneliness is proof. It's sad... he will always love you. It's sad

As the merging traffic passed he found himself staring down at his own hands.. Not remembering the change. Not recalling the plan. Was it?. He was okay but wondering about wandering.. Was it age by consequence or was he moved by sleight of hand?. Mondays were made to fall. Lost on a road he knew by heart.. It was like a book he read in his sleep. Endlessly.. Sometimes he hid in the radio watching other pull into their homes.. While he was drifting.. On a line of his own. Off the line of the side. Bye the by.. As dirt turned to sand. As if moved by sleight of hand.. When he reached the shore of his clip on world he resurfaced to the norm.. Organized his few things. His coat and keys.. And he knew realizations would have to wait.. Till he had more time. More time.. A time to dream to himself. He waves goodbye to his self.. I'll see you on the other side.."
