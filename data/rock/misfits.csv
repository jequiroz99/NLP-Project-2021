monster mash,"Good evening!. I was working in the lab late one night. When my eyes beheld an eerie sight. My monster, from its slab, began to rise. And suddenly to my surprise. He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash. The Monster Mash, and it's a graveyard smash. He did the Mash, it caught on in a flash. He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash. From my laboratory in the castle east. To the master bedroom, where the vampires feast. The ghouls all came from their humble abodes. To get a jolt from my electrodes. They did the Mash, they did the Monster Mash. The Monster Mash, it was a graveyard smash. They did the Mash, they caught on in a flash. They did the Mash, they did the Monster Mash. The zombies were having fun. The party had just begun. The guests included Wolfman. Dracula, and his son. The scene was rocking, all were digging the sound. Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds. The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive. With their vocal group, The Crypt Keeper Five. They did the Mash, they played the Monster Mash. The Monster Mash, it was a graveyard smash. They played the Mash, they caught on in a flash. They played the Mash, they played the Monster Mash. Out of his coffin his voice did ring. Seems he was troubled by just one thing. Opened the lid, shook his fist, and said. ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?"". It's now the Mash, it's now the Monster Mash. The Monster Mash, and it's a graveyard smash. It's now the Mash, it caught on in a flash. It's now the Mash, it's now the Monster Mash. Now everything is cool, Drac's a part of the band. My Monster Mash is the hit of the land. For you, the living, this Mash was meant, too. When you get to my door, tell them Only sent you. Then you can Mash, then you can Monster Mash. The Monster Mash, another graveyard smash. Then you can Mash, you'll catch on in a flash. Then you can Mash, you did the Monster Mash. The Monster Mash...."

To the north we run 'til the morning glows. And your blood runs cold. Your blood runs cold in. This twilight of the dead"
