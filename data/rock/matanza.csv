belshazzar,"Well the Bible tells us about a man. Who ruled Babylon and all it's land. Around the city he built a wall. And declared that Babylon would never fall. He had concubines and wives. He called his Babylon ""Paradise"". On his throne he drank and ate. But for Belshazzer it was getting late. For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting. His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. He was weighed in the balance and found wanting. His houses were built upon the sand. The people feast and drank their wine. And praised the false gods of his time. All holy things were scorned and mocked. But suddenly all their mocking stopped. For on the wall there appeared a hand. Nothing else, there was no man. And but, the hand began to write. And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting. His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. He was weighed in the balance and found wanting. His houses were built upon the sand. Well no one around could understand. What was written by the mystic hand. Belshazzar tried but couldn't find. A man who could give him piece of mind. But Daniel the prophet, the man of God. He saw the writing on the wall in blood. Belshazzar asked him what it said. And Daniel turned to the wall and read. ""My friend your weighed in the balance and found wanting. Your kingdom was divided, it can't stand. Your weighed in the balance and found wanting. Your houses were built upon the sand"". Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving. I won't even turn my head. Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talkin'. I'll be gone like I said. You'd say the same old things that you've been saying all along. Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut 'til I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar cryin' cussin' moan,. Understand your man (I'm tired of your badmouthin'). Understand your man.. You can give my other suits to the Salvation Army. And everything else I leave behind.. I ain't takin' nothing that'll slow down my travelin'. While I'm untanglin' my mind.. I ain't gonna repeat what I said anymore. While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before. I'll be as gone as a wild goose in winter. Then you'll understand your man (meditate on it). Understand your man (you hear me talkin'). Understand your man (remember what I told ya)"
big river,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,. and I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.. And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.. Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.. I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).. And it tore me up ev'ry time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.. Then I heard my dream was back downstream cavortin' in Davenport,. And I followed you, Big River, when you called.. Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).. A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.. I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.. She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.. Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.. Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.. Go on, I""ve had enough; dump my blues down in the gulf.. She loves you, Big River, more than me."

don't take your guns to town,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe. Grew restless on the farm. A boy filled with wanderlust. Who really meant no harm. He changed his clothes and shined his boots. And combed his dark hair down. And his mother cried as he walked out;. Refrain:. ""Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. Don't take your guns to town."". He sang a song as on he rode,. His guns hung at his hips. He rode into a cattle town,. A smile upon his lips. He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down. But his mother's words echoed again;. Refrain:. ""Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. Don't take your guns to town."". He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand. And tried to tell himself at last he had become a man. A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down. And he heard again his mother's words;. Refrain:. ""Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. Don't take your guns to town."". Bill was raged and Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw. But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw. As Billy Joe fell to the floor the crowd all gathered 'round. And wondered at his final words;. Refrain:. ""Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home, Bill. Don't take your guns to town."""
