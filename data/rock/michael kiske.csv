be true to yourself,"I came down. But my head went up. I had no doubts. And hope there was not. Break it loose. Spread the news. Get it out. Make it loud. Sing it!. I got it comin' there is nothing that can stop me. I feel it comin' there's no limit to the free me. The sky is open and the angels sing it so clear. I am the winner over all these hidden fears. Be true to yourself!. I have found. I once was lost. I came round. To see what it costs. Kick it up. To the top. There's a lot. That I got. Hear it!. Don't wanna look back, got to start to see the future. Don't wanna hold back got to let it out and to ya. The bomb is ticking, I know it's gonna blow up.

sacred grounds,"I am gone, I am gone. Occasionally we leave to get us back. We're gone but haven't found what's ours yet. I am lost, I am lost. Secretly the lost that sets us free. Brings you down to what you really need. It's not that I want to. It's not that I need to. It's not that I long to fall. I don't - want to know. For good - don't wanna rob your goods. I really don't mind to value it. I took - what was my own. Look - I really don't fly to unsacred grounds. To - survey your world. But tell me haven't you heard. Now I'm here, now I'm here. Your tainted cry now scattered falls apart. The fear has proven now where you are. I won't give in, won't give in. So desperately we boil, our ego's none. They quiet us down to sing rattle and hum. It's not that we want to. It's not that we need to. It's not that we long to fall. I don't - want to know. For good - the wonder of your goods. I really don't mind to value it. I took - what was my own. Look - I really don't fly to unsacred grounds. To - survey your world. But tell me haven't you heard. Here I go again, here we come again. You won't carry that weight alone on you. You knew the sense of my flight, I sense all your fights. There's really no peace for coming in.. I don't - want to know. For good - don't wanna rob your goods. I really don't mind to value it. I took - what was my own. Look - I really don't fly to unsacred grounds. To - survey your world. But tell me haven't you heard"
when you're down on your knees that's when you're closest to heaven,"I don't believe what you're saying. I don't believe a word. You never did anything that was true. And hate will be your final work. I wouldn't dance at your party. No, I wouldn't risk a dance. And for the rest of my time. I will keep it mind. I will look at your life and will find:. When you're down on your knees. That's when you're closest to heaven. I don't believe when you're smiling. I don't believe in your mask. You hardly say anything you don't use. All your life is a lie at it's best. Your love means never another. Is there anything left that is true?. You will end all alone. With no peace of your own. 'Cause the god of love you've never known!. When you're down on your knees. That's when you're closest to heaven. I guess you'll never get it. You'll never regret all the broken hearts. You've left behind. If there's one thing that you'll never find -. It's a peace of mind. There's always one a lonely street. Walking his way to the sun. There's always one. That takes the whole world's greed. All on his back and it's done. And ever since the world's turning. There's always a fool that is leading the blind. If there's one thing that you'll never find -. It's a peae of mind. Your thoughts are so low it's a shame. That's why for you everyone else is low. People see life through the glass in their hearts. So the fruits of your doings do show. In this world it all could mean maybe. But on the other side you'll hear it loud. I know time clears the clouds. One day you won't walk so proud. It will all be revealed there's no doubt. 'Cause when you're down on your knees. That's when you're closest to heaven. When you're down on your knees. That's when you're closest to heaven"

Sometimes it´s hard to see that you´re running out of luck. Right now it´s my own life I don´t know. With everything I did I was the one who laughed. Yes I was always tall and smiled. Yes everything I did I thought would always last. And I felt always strong inside. Now there´s no place for me. And no one to set me free. There is no way to go. There is no place for me. Where it´s warm and where I can be. At least there is no place that I know. But I´m fine, I´m alright even though there´s nothing left. ´Cos what it means I´m sure will show. Somewhere along the way I lost the key for it. But I was always true inside. Somewhere inside myself I´m praying for a bit. Of what was always open wide. When I look around there´s only broken glass I see. And everywhere I reach it´s hunting me. Looking back I find there was not much how it should be. It´s slowly killing me!. I got to go, kick all dust off my shoes. Take all that´s good inside and turn it ´round. ´Cos with everything I did I was the one who laughed. Yes I was always tall and smiled. Yes everything I did I thought would always last. And felt always strong inside"

longing,"Feelings come and go - I've never known. Something longs to grow - won't let go. Spirits 'round my head - are whispering. I turn inside instead - of wondering. Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be. A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free. If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me. How could I see anything - how could I be anything?. Restless minds have searched - long before. The truth will be the same - for evermore. The mightiness of trees - that you can feel. Can give you all you need - just listen still. Here is love and there is pain. It's all around, it's all the same. There's nothing new that I could tell to you. But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts. We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject. The truth that is in everything - that is and has been and will be. There is a long way to go - there is a high place to know. There is a world to go through - but there's so much more to do. Until we're home!. Deep inside of me - I know there's.... Feelings come and go - I've never known"
do i remember a life?,"I once was a blue eyed. I once dreamed I was free. I once dived in a life spending sea. And heard the voice of the priest. I once heard the angels. Singing the song of the cross. There was no fear, no doubts in our hearts. No soul could ever get lost. I prayed to the heavens above. I reached for the sky full of love. Awaited the luminous sign. To hear what's heard by the pure-restless mind. Now you can see me return. I look for the priest to make me learn. Will I remember the past?. Make me return to the best!. Do I remember a life?. In the dark age of time?. I hear it call in my dreams. Maybe I was not alone?. Maybe I called friends my own?. Together hearts full of love!. I know my heart says the truth. Maybe it was me and you?. I got to return to the wind. This world is never our home. Somewhere I left friends alone. Can someone show me the way?. Do I remember a life?. There once was the mystery. That now sings in my heart. The fire in my veins talks so loud about the past. About the place where the love for our hearts starts. We once moved through the cold fields. Strong and save led by the gods. The voices in the wind sang the children to sleep. Free spirits looked clear through the dark. I pray to the heavens abouve. I reach for the sky full of love. I wait for the luminous sign. To hear what's heard by the pure-restless mind. I see the twelve around the ONE. The mystery truth to carry on. A fight against the strong earth-kings. The sungod's light we had to bring. Do I remember a life?. In the dark age of time?. I hear it call in my dreams. Maybe I was not alone?. Maybe I called friends my own?. Together hearts full of love!. I know my heart says the truth. Maybe it was me and you?. I got to return to the wind. This world is never our home. Somewhere I left friends alone. Can someone show me the way?. Do I remember a life?. Oh, god! Help me to understand me. Guide me through visions I see. So far. You carry my soul back in time. The past shows the future to climb. Oh, god! Did I once be there by your side?. Will I once return to your light?. So far - Away from this world leads your love. My heart gets the wings of a dove and flies. Oh, god! Help me to sing you this song. I pray for your kingdom to come -"
a little time,"Higher. It's what I expect from my Life. It's like a wire. That holds me back down to the ground. Oh, I hear you say. ""That is the way of the world"". No, hear what I say.

""I wanna do so much in my way"". Chorus. We got. A little time to build up your lives. A little time to make up our minds. A little time to fill up our dreams. A little time, time. [Solo].

a song is just a moment,"A song is just a moment that might never come back. A song is just a feeling that sometimes I regret. When in that magic moment a melody is born. Some other moments later it may bother like thorn. Because I´ve got to live my life like everyone must do. I don´t regret a single feeling I had to walk through. Life is a thing to get to know ourselves. And you´re a king when clear hear those bells. It´s clear, so clear I see!. I wright down my emotions to see waht´s up inside. I walk across this bridge called life and found a place to hide. who ever you may talk to, the sky will still br blue!. What ever you may talk ´bout me, it shows what´s inside 'o you. If there´s a truth, it stays the truth, whatever mankind does. I just decicted silently: I do belive in love. Life is a thing to get to know ourselves. And you´re a king when clear hear those bells. It´s clear, so clear when you see!. Things are comming, things are going, who´ll make the score?. I feel that I´m not scared as much I was yeas before!. My mind is a thing that hanges colours fast. What times ever brings, we know it never lasts. Who knows? Maybe God? Maybe God!"

hunted,Did you ever ask yourself. About the way things might have been?. Did you ever blame yourself. About the mess that now you're in?. God I hate you!. But should I hate you?.

You're hunting me!. I'm angry - can you feel me?. I'm hungry - for the truth!. I'm hunted - like a madman. I suffer - just like you!. Have you ever been really down. And seen it all from there?. Will you hide your glory now. Or do you want to share?. Did you ever think about. The chance that you did wrong?. Did you ever think about. That no other chance may come?. I know!. You hang my head. You burn my heart. You break my neck. You're hunting me!. I'm angry - can you feel me?. I'm hungry - for the truth!. I'm hunted - like a madman. I suffer - just like you!
i believe,"Give me two strong arms to fight my enemies. Give me two strong eyes to see the truth. Give me two strong legs I think I have to run. And fill my heart will faith that I won't lose. I don't wanna lose. Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there. Make me feel your presence in the night. Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie. And take my soul so I won't have to hide. I don't wanna hide. it's so cold deep down here. I know we had to fall. Souls are dying everywhere. But whatever I do I believe. (Solo). There'll be no reason to live. Without you giving me light. There is so much that you give. Your love is shining so bright. I believe.... I wanna love but I always hate. I wanna give but I always take. Want you to laugh but I make you cry. No I won't change until I die. It's so much easier said than done. I know I can't just always run. Got so much anger inside of me. I understand but I think I see what I'm not. I know it's true what J.C. said. I got it all clear in my head. Seems we were born to be unfair. I am a sinner that's starting to dare to believe. Give me your hand until the end. And I will walk into the promised land. I don't deserve anything you do. But I can't stop loving you. No more lies, no false religions. No more whys and wrong God missions. No shiny T.V. priests begging for cash. No more wars that no God's never asked for. There's a way back out of here. One day we're going home. Tell everyone who wants to hear. Whatever you do:. Do believe, I believe, we believe, believe oh!"
i don't deserve love,"Most of my days are dancing around me. Most of my time it's I, my, me, mine. If you wanna buy trouble, go spend some of you in me. If you want that your heart breaks, fine!. I'm sad and lonely but It's only right. I'm far too hungry building boundaries. I don't deserve your love!. No I don't deserve love!. If you see me coming, consider running. When I enter your room, I'm there. Even my longing-prayer is a stunning. Feast of my own somewhere. It's hard to leave me, I can't stay of my path. I claim to be free but who is that you see?. I don't deserve your love!. No I don't deserve love!. I won't forget to bring you down. To build a nice frame for your frown. I won't forget to boost your pain. Forever and always the same is me.. I'm sad and lonely but it's only right. I'm still too hungry feeding my being. Nothing I'm saying I say without me. All that I sell is mine. The songs that I'm singing, the love that I'm bringing. Even my waste of time. I don't deserve your love!. No I don't deserve love!. I don't deserve your love!. No I don't deserve love!"
in the night,"In the night I'm calling you!. Be my guide help me through!. In the night I call your name. You're the light in times of shame!. The songs I sing. All my love I bring for you!. I always try to make things better. Everything that has gone wrong. Mighty plans in the right direction. But very little has been done. Everyday when I try to get forward. I find myself another mile back. Help me fighting!. Help me breathing!. Why am I falling down instead?. Ev'ry useful minute seems to be the thought of you. Ev'ry hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do. Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!. In the night.... Sometimes I cried after all I lied to you. (Solo). Free from ourselves and free from this world we may find. The freedom we search. 'Cause all that we need is inside!. The hours we waste we may not get back for a while. And when it gets dark. No chance will be there for a try. When I wake up early in the morning. I catch a book and jump inside. I fill my head with a million wonders. And try to fill the night with light. The moment when I get things clearer. I see another mountain to climb. And always when I think I'm nearer. I realise there is no time. In the night.... This song I sing, all my love I bring for you!"
it,"When you say your love is outrageous. I'm not trying matching with you. Fear eats through the ages. Swallows all good that we do. When IT comes close tonight. I grab as much of IT as I can get my hands on. The sound gets clear and bright. And bitterness is far. I understand: time demands pain. And constantly we kill all youth. In unison we sing in vain. If we don't care for truth. Still we paint our intentions blue-ish. Life-fakes get colored pink. It's the days of the foolish. Where men steal the sky with a blink. When IT shows what's inside. We take IT or leave IT or just roll on with our lives. Superficialized. We can't hear when IT calls. I understand: time demands pain. And constantly we kill all youth. In unison we sing in vain. If we don't care for truth. Let's pretend the circle is cornered. and stones will turn into gold. Let's try to make the sea turn red. Or to grow up before we get old. When IT comes close tonight. I grab as much of IT as I can get my hands on. The sound gets clear and bright. And bitterness is far. I understand: time demands pain. And constantly we kill all youth. In unison we sing in vain. If we don't care for truth. If IT is IT, IT saves the day. If IT is not we earn our pay. Is IT was IT has seemed to say. We get IT anyway!"
kids of the century,"We poison our hearts. We poison our seas. We burn down the paradise. We're stoppin' good waves. We're losin' our trees. The future looks bright ahead. I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies. We're lost in this time--we create so fine. The future we already fear. Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt. The future looks bright ahead. We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games. No time for the memories we look in the haze. We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault. Ev'rything's done mum, we fall. Let's keep on crying. But sometimes I don't wanna fall. Ev'rytime when you look around things will smile at you. Ev'rytime when you turn around you smell the truth. But you run away from the lies you can't say. Don't run away from the lies you can't say. We're the kids. ."

longing,"Feelings come and go - I've never known. Something longs to grow - won't let go. Spirits 'round my head - are whispering. I turn inside instead - of wondering. Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be. A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free. If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me. How could I see anything - how could I be anything?. Restless minds have searched - long before. The truth will be the same - for evermore. The mightiness of trees - that you can feel. Can give you all you need - just listen still. Here is love and there is pain. It's all around, it's all the same. There's nothing new that I could tell to you. But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts. We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject. The truth that is in everything - that is and has been and will be. There is a long way to go - there is a high place to know. There is a world to go through - but there's so much more to do. Until we're home!. Deep inside of me - I know there's.... Feelings come and go - I've never known"

Warm as the sunlight shining on her head. . When I awake and see her there so close beside me. I want to take her in my arms,. The ache is there so deep inside me. Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning. Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away. And when she turns to touch me I kiss her fingers so softly. And then my Mary wake to love and love again. And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather. She doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share,. We share together. Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening. Kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair. And as we walk, I hold her close beside me. All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share"

With all kinds of overkills. Never get enough. I don't think I ever will. Have you seen the magazine. Where man kills wife and kids 'cos of a failed dream?. I think it's hot and: thanx a lot!. For the ten great shots of car crashes that now I got. Around the corner was an accident. Was cool blood, so I went. All these whole worlds in those heads. We'll see where it all gets. My fingers are crossed anyway. If time isn't on our side. I don't think we'll keep our pride. There is not much I feel. Can't tell what's fake or real. I've got to see some blood. Oh baby: Thanx a lot!. If I had some money. That would be so cool. I'd buy a lot of guns to be nobody's fool. I'm smarter than you and the president. I will be laughing in the end. All these whole worlds in those heads. We'll see where it all gets. My fingers are crossed anyway. If time isn't on our side. I don't think we'll keep our pride"
the calling,"Well better it is when you can hold on to it. When you keep the grip to push it higher. The further you get the more you use it up. You got to look for news and you better do!.

A new light shines over everything I ever knew and. everything I did!. I hear you calling my name. I hear you calling just the same. How could I know that I would get to see it. When I keep the laws of all our fathers?. The more I pray the more they take control. The more they bless my soul and I want 'em to!. Up to the stars that's where my soul is flying. And I see that nothing else matters. With everything that my heart can take. They gonna lift me up and I see the truth!. God send whispers, shining colour pictures go all. through my head. A new light shines over everything I ever knew and. everything I did!. I hear you calling my name. I hear you calling just the same. And I wanna fly so high when I die!. I hear you calling my name. I hear you calling just the same. And I wanna fly so high when I die!"

Oh I will never close my eyes. Will never lie. It's time to make it happen. Go inside. Time's passing by. We are getting closer to it. Come and take my hand. Leave behind the nasty world.

watch your blue,"Now you're well educated. All you speak sounds so well. All class is demonstrated. There's really not much to tell. With perfect look and perfect smell. With perfect style, all perfect well:. Watch your blue if your precious black!. Nothing you do could bother. All that you wear looks clean. You satisfy your father. In everyway life looks green. No one ever makes it better. No one ever beats you, never:. Watch your blue if your precious black!. But I - it seems I don't mind. I'm wasting a lifetime to bring down. What could wear that crown. My head - grows heavy instead. A heart made of stone. Potential unknown!. In darkness we kill our partners. In darkness we speak our minds. Don't let us look inside there!. Who knows what we might find?. Get it on and get it all. No one wins by thinking small:. Watch your blue if your precious black!. And I .... Stay what's to stay!. Say what to say!. Pray when you pray!. Fear when you fear!. Here comes the feeling lonely. And here comes the feeling blue. Innocence's lost so truly. Innocence's gone, that's true. I - it seems I don't mind ...

we got the right,"Don't turn your head. Back to the wall. Don't close your eyes. And wait for your fall. If you believe that you know in this time. You've got anything to win. If you believe that you know. Then I say, ""You'll lose all again"". Bridge:. In this time there's nothing to get for you. You cannot really do what you want. You're a child, a prisoner in your mind. You are a victim of this hopeless time. You better believe all you do has a sense. It's not for nothing. You better believe all the troubles you have. Will play you someday. Bridge:. Why don't you help yourself and do the best. Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass. Why don't you stand up to say who you are. To show the people that paradise is not far. Chorus:. Oh, can't you see we got the right. To look into the future without no need to hide. No, we won't accept what you do. We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse. Oh, can't you see we got the right. To say we are here to see the light. No, we don't wanna lose all again. Stand up, you people, to save the world. As good as you can. (Solo: both). We are credulous idiots. And won't understand what they plan. We march with the times. It's what they expect and we do. Why don't you open your eyes. To undercover all of these lies. I think you won't accept this. Go oppose with your fist. Fight for your rights. Chorus:. Oh, can't you see we got the right. To say we are here to see the light. No, we don't wanna lose all again. Stand up, you people, to save the world. As good as you can. No, we don't wanna lose all again. Stand up, you people, to save the world. As good as you can"
when the sinner,"Now it's time - to shake it all up to be free. Now it's time - to make us some room to let us be. Oh, it feels so bad. Yes it feels so bad. When everything good looks so bad. When everything right goes so wrong. I am up - to break it all down what's in my way. I won't stop - until I am where I'm going to stay. No one holds me back. No, no one holds me back. Don't wanna be what I'm not. But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck. I here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere. We look around and search around and walk around and hear around. We keep on looking 'til we know what for. If you don't know it, I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?. All of us don't know what we should know - maybe one day we'll know. But anyway we've got to make a stop. Over my head - look over my head you won't see no halo. It's driving me mad - I must hold it back inside. When the sinner searches sin, it's all of us. When we finally search inside, it's under us. We keep on looking anyway. If we don't find it who must pay?. All I've ever done I've done to you!. In my mind - the battle goes on 'til I give up. Will we find - the key of life we once have dropped?. Do you really care?. Tell me you really care!. You may find Mr. Blame. But the guilt of life burns everywhere. Give me light to see my inside, give me light to see my sin. I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad. You must be joking when you point at me!. Hey! Don't you blame me! Don't you touch me!. Won't you ever leave me be?. I wanna live! Don't wanna think! Why should I give what I can drink?. Man! Life is short so I take what I need!. Over your head.... When the sinner.... Pain!. I feel inside it's such a. Shame!. No one fights fair, but who' to. Blame!. Might be the game of life but it aint' over. Now!. I walk my way firm any. How!. My conscience speaks and there are. Doubts!. But nothing's sure in lifeand it ain't over. Now!. I look here.... Over my head.... When the sinner..."
when you're down on your knees that's when you're closest to heaven,"I don't believe what you're saying. I don't believe a word. You never did anything that was true. And hate will be your final work. I wouldn't dance at your party. No, I wouldn't risk a dance. And for the rest of my time. I will keep it mind. I will look at your life and will find:. When you're down on your knees. That's when you're closest to heaven. I don't believe when you're smiling. I don't believe in your mask. You hardly say anything you don't use. All your life is a lie at it's best. Your love means never another. Is there anything left that is true?. You will end all alone. With no peace of your own. 'Cause the god of love you've never known!. When you're down on your knees. That's when you're closest to heaven. I guess you'll never get it. You'll never regret all the broken hearts. You've left behind. If there's one thing that you'll never find -. It's a peace of mind. There's always one a lonely street. Walking his way to the sun. There's always one. That takes the whole world's greed. All on his back and it's done. And ever since the world's turning. There's always a fool that is leading the blind. If there's one thing that you'll never find -. It's a peae of mind. Your thoughts are so low it's a shame. That's why for you everyone else is low. People see life through the glass in their hearts. So the fruits of your doings do show. In this world it all could mean maybe. But on the other side you'll hear it loud. I know time clears the clouds. One day you won't walk so proud. It will all be revealed there's no doubt. 'Cause when you're down on your knees. That's when you're closest to heaven. When you're down on your knees. That's when you're closest to heaven"
where wishes fly,Some say the prize is paid. Some preach eternal pay. Where you go nobody knows!. Before you came to me. Life was light and clean. Where we go nobody knows nobody!. Forget tomorrow!. We have today!. And we steal the night? A good try will show!. Can we go and leave it?. Words alone won't do!. When their lights get dim let's see what still glows!. Will you stay with me. When HE can't set me free?. Will you love me when nobody knows my name?. Would you see me through. When I'm just a burden for you?. Can I catch you when nobody knows your name?. Say we're together!. We stop the time!. These feelings come from where spirits fly!. Come see our treasures!. Let's tolerate!. These spirits come from where wishes fly!. From where wishes fly!...
you always walk alone,"When I hold the key to open heaven's door. I will never make the mistake and give it back. When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late. I will never give it back. Bridge:. There's just one way I see. The way I think it's right for me. You say to me I will repent what I do. If it's right I'll stop before. When I see the light of sun will fade away. And I reveal what I have loved before. It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay. And I reveal what I have loved before. Bridge:. There's just one way I see. The way I think it's right for me. You say to me I will repent what I do. If it's right I'll stop before. Chorus:. The life I try to give is. All I have inside of me. It's one kind of life for me. This music you hear. The strength we have inside is. So much more than you will know. But if you can't see the life around. You'll always walk alone. (Solo: Kai/Mike). Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes. See his strong hands. But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice. See the drunk man, try to ask him why. He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie. There's a fight in his head he cannot win. Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin. You--you cannot hide. You--you cannot describe your feelings inside. (Solo: Mike/Kai). Chorus:. The life I try to give is. All I have inside of me. It's one kind of life for me. This music you hear. The strength we have inside is. So much more than you will know. But if you can't see the life around. You'll always walk alone"
your turn,"Now there is this day, a lot of things are changing. Can't just kick it away, got to get things right. Sometimes it happens fast and nothin' seems to last. The thing that I once started isn't mine anymore. I guess now it's my turn. You've got a face like a child, got a mind like a woman. Your smile is warm and tender. I hear the people say that I should stay away. From you and all the problems you might bring. They'll never know--you. Nobody ever knows what to do. They'll never see you cry. They'll never know why. Now it's your turn to break free. When you want it all you've got to see. Now it's your turn to break free. When you want the life, you've got to see what it means. See the little boy holding mama's hand. His eyes can see the things we've long forgotten. The world is easy now--and somehow. He's right. Until there is this day when Mickey Mouse must go away. It's your turn to break free. .. This world is crying to be free. This world is dying can't you see. We need a turn to do it right. We need a mind-revolution. To get away from this selfishness. Stop playing blind--break free"
