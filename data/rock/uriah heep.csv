the wizard,He was the wizard. Of a thousand kings. And I chanced to meet him. One night wandering. He told me tales. And he drank my wine. Me and my magic man. Kinda feeling fine. He had a cloak of gold. And eyes of fire. And as he spoke. I felt a deep desire. To free the world. Of its fear and pain. And help the people. To feel free again. Why don't we listen to. The voices in our hearts. â€˜Cause then I know we'd find. We're not so far apart. Everybody's got to be happy. Everyone should sing. For we know the joy of life. The peace that love can bring. So spoke the wizard. In his mountain home. The vision of his wisdom. Means we'll never be alone. And I will dream of my magic night. And a million silver stars. That guide me with their light. .
lady in black,"She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning. Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind. I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking. And destruction lay around me, from a fight I could not win. Ahh.... She asked me name my foe then, I said the need within some men. To fight and kill their brothers, without thought of love or God. And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemy. So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life. Ahh.... But she wouldn't think of battle that, reduces men to animals. So easy to begin and yet impossible to end. For she the mother of all men, had counseled me so wisely that. I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay. Ahh.... Oh lady lend your hand I cried, oh let me rest here at your side. Have faith and trust in me she said, and filled my heart with life. There's no strength in numbers, have no such misconception. But when you need me be assured I won't be far away. Ahh.... Thus having spoke she turned away, and though I found no words to say. I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear. My labor is no easier but now I know I'm not alone. I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day. And if one day she comes to you, drink deeply from her words so wise. Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me"
gypsy,"I was only seventeen. I fell in love with a gypsy queen. She told me: ""Hold on"". Her father was the leading man. Said: ""You're not welcome on our land"". And then as a foe, he told me to go. He took me to a little shack. And put a whip across my back. Then told her: ""Leave me"". I was out for quite a time. Came back with her on my mind. Sweet little girl. She means all the world. Oh, I want my qypsy queen. Will she still be torn between. Her father and lover. One day I will go to him. Strong enough to fight and win. The kind of a man. That he'll understand"
tales,"We told our tales as we sat under. Morning's sleepy sky. With all the colours of. The sunrise shining in our eyes. One, then another. With a story of yesterday's life. Or of a lover who had. Gone in a moment of strife. No thought of sleep ever dwells. Upon the wise man's mind. Some task or audience. Stealing every moment of his time. Thus we have learned to live. While mortal men. Stand waiting to die. How can we do what must be done. In just one short life. And if you ask. Then you must know. If you still doubt. You should be told. It was not we. That made it so. It was by those. Who went before. And there you sit. Tomorrow's child. So full of love. So full of life. But you must rise. To meet the day. Lest you become another tale. Another tale .... ."

Strange but realistic objects. Making me that way. Then it's gone as fast as it came. Evil dream. Changing like the sun turn to rain. It would seem. La la la la la â€¦.

Rides to paradise. Then it's gone as fast as it came. Peaceful scene. Changing like the sun turns to rain. It would seem. La la la la la â€¦. Sleepless nights that last a lifetime. Crucify my head. Dreams of peace and then disaster. Wish that I were dead. Looking for the end of darkness. Seeking out the day. For escape with speed of thunder. Bearing me away. Then it's gone as fast as it came. Peaceful scene. Changing like the sun turns to rain. It would seem. La la la la la â€¦. Come into my dream. ."

'Cause I found a way. That we can fly forever. With direction and peace of mind. The river will flow. Come to the light, my love. 'Cause I need you here. I need you here tonight. The chains of love they run so deep. But the hand that writes the law is weak. Oh take me, take me. From this heartless land. 'Cause it's the place the broken go. The place that we don't want to know. There is no love. Inside this heartless land. ."
heaven's rain,"I look back on those days. At the permanet haze. And the dark that surrounded me. Then good fortune arrived. I saw life in your eyes. You talked about changing views. Freedom to choose, darkness to light. There lies the kingdom. Of beautiful stories. Pure as the heaven's rain. Shine on the heartache. The bittersweet glory. Shine over everyone. Down the road I would fall. The wrong side of the wall. Sound of madness. Moved in for the kill. Then good fortune arrived. I saw life in your eyes. You talked about taking me. To a place I should know. Just you and me. There's a hole in the sun. Where I wanted to run. The were clouds in the open sea. Then good fortune arrived. I saw life in your eyes. You talked about taking me. To a place I should know. Just you and me. Shine over everyone"
here am i,"I sit in my sunny chair. With my head held low. I know the reason Iâ€™m dreaming. Itâ€™s really been fun. But where is there left to go. Save to give my life a new meaning. And if by chance. Youâ€™d come my way. Iâ€™ll have to say. Here am I, give me love. Here am I, give me love. How was I to know. Your heart was unsatisfied. When you never troubled to tell me. No wish that you made to me. Ever was denied. I played it just the way. That it should be. But then you turned. And walked away. I have to say. Here am I, give me love. Here am I, give me love. Here am I, give me love. I imagine I must sit here. Till the winter comes. And just watch the days. Growing shorter. To gather in dust wonâ€™t go. Till my thinkingâ€™s done. And I walk from this troubled water. By then my need wonâ€™t be so bad. And Iâ€™ll gladly say. Here am I, give me love. Here am I, give me love .... ."
high priestess,"You, who brought. The sunshine to my eyes. You, who wondered. Through my sad disguise. And I have a love. That cannot die ... for you. High priestess of my heart.

Tell me that we won't part"

Burn their eyes on you moving. And if they shout, don't let it change. A thing that you're doing. Hold your head up .... ."
holding on,"Lost, lost like a precious flame. The ashes burn on. The ghost of a love we had. Tries to hold on, tries to hold on. No communication. All systems are down. No new conversation. Never a sound, never a sound. What's the point in holdin' on. When the spirit is gone, holdin' on. What's the point in holdin' on. When the spirit is gone. Cold, cold as the empty night. Deep in your eyes. I know there's no truth, no light. Only your lies, only your lies. The circle's broken. The damage is done. The crystal lies. Smashed on the floor. Your presence has left me now. Your spirit has gone. The ghost of a love we had. Tries to hold on, tries to hold on. The circle's broken. The damage is done. So what's the point in holdin' on. ."
holy roller,I was born an only boy. Away from palm of water. Never heard of right or wrong. I was given words to use. But I knew I was different. They wanted me to play along.

hot night in a cold town,"Sonny's out strolling, ambling slowly. Washed in amber street lights. A Mexican wind blows in. Takin' ahold of Angelina's hair. And her halo. Motors running, muffling the sound. Of the street talk. A big deal's goin' down. In another hot night. In a cold town. Got yourself a hot night. In a cold town. Johnny's got spare change. In his pocket. A ring and a watch. To hock for a sweet ride. A one way ticket. Hidden in his shoe. These last few hours. He says he'll spend with you. He's leavin' home without a trace. No forwarding address. He'll never have to face another. Hot night. In a cold town. Got yourself a hot night. In a cold town. Well, the losers and the groovers. And the corner boys. Are hangin' around. Runnin' in and out of doorways. Up and down the stairways. Stray dogs headed for the pound. In another. Hot night in a cold town. Got you, got yourself a. Hot night in a cold, cold town. Cold town. It's just another hot night. In a cold town. Such a cold town. ."

There's a storm inside my head. And I know it doesn't lead. To a clearer day. When nobody will cry. I can't stand here alone. And I need to be free. So bring fire and bring steel. For you know the way I feel. Bring a silver horse. To carry me away. I'm no stranger, I'm a friend. And my pain will never end. Till the world will let us. Live our lives as one. And our time is our own. And our hearts can be free. I wanna be free .... ."

I know how it is when things go bad. But I'm sure that. I have found the way. I'm happy here and here I'll stay. Here I´ll stay
illusion,In a forest known as heartbreak. In a clearing in the wood. 'Cross a pathway called confusion. Toward the garden of delight. You'll reach the river of desire. And meekly try and cross it. While the valley of love. Keeps avoiding you. Because it's only an illusion. Only an illusion. Upon the hill of high ideals. You begin to wonder if it's real. You are reaching sleep's oasis. You begin to wonder how you feel. But it happens so quickly. It doesn't fit into your scenes. Tossin' and turnin'. The star of so many scenes. It's only an illusion. It's only an illusion. .
imagination,"Sometimes I'm certain. Sometimes my mind is. Filled with doubt. Some thoughts lay heavy here. Sometimes I think it's figured out. Imagination. Endless voyage of discovery.

Imagination, bitter-sweet companion. As my time flies by. Love-hate relation. Hand in hand toward infinity. Lead me here, lead me there. Everywhere if you really dare. Today, tonight, tomorrow. You don't have to take my hand. I'll take it just the way it's planned. Lead on, speed on, I'll follow. When you see me coming. You're gonna know I'm not alone. Me and my imagination.

She said she likes such mature men. Yes, she did. She says that Iâ€™m so nice and strong. Iâ€™m getting through, it wonâ€™t be long. In love. With her hands caressing my face. In love. Iâ€™m so glad Iâ€™ve got my own place. In love. She must be of very bad taste. In love, in love, in love. There must come a time. Even for me. But all this happens so suddenly. So quick.

in the moment,"Here we are. Once more in a world full of fantasy. Dream again. You need to believe in a future. That's bright as the sun. Shining there for you. Shining there for me.

All the way. I followed the road that was real to me. And suddenly. You take it for granted. And things don't turn out. Like you planned. When you think you've found. What is good and true. Through the open door. It can really turn on you. So here we are. We look for the light in so many eyes. And in our life. When hope starts to fade. There's a strength that. We give to each other. Walking in the sky over everyone. Head above the coulds. As we're touching the sun. ."

lady in black,"She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning. Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind. I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking. And destruction lay around me, from a fight I could not win. Ahh.... She asked me name my foe then, I said the need within some men. To fight and kill their brothers, without thought of love or God. And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemy. So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life. Ahh.... But she wouldn't think of battle that, reduces men to animals. So easy to begin and yet impossible to end. For she the mother of all men, had counseled me so wisely that. I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay. Ahh.... Oh lady lend your hand I cried, oh let me rest here at your side. Have faith and trust in me she said, and filled my heart with life. There's no strength in numbers, have no such misconception. But when you need me be assured I won't be far away. Ahh.... Thus having spoke she turned away, and though I found no words to say. I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear.

The lady's got me tied up. Don't know how it's gonna wind up. One way or another. Gonna be all right. I'm beginning to think. That a forever kind of love. Is the kind of love. I'll look for forever.

But where is the cure. The lady's got me real good. But you can't say. What I should do. One way or another. It's all over now. One way or another

I will not be hurried down. Or blackened by your lies. I must go and find my dream. And live in paradise. .

Gone in a moment of strife. No thought of sleep ever dwells. Upon the wise man's mind. Some task or audience. Stealing every moment of his time. Thus we have learned to live. While mortal men.

the hanging tree,"Passing through the arms of Satan. Reaching for the hands of God. Robbing every mind for wisdom. Running so he won't get caught. He's outlawed by majority. Been branded all his life. Some say that he's a sinner man. As he rides from day to night. He's a bad man, so they say. Living for his love and living free. Riding swift and secretly. So he'll miss the hanging tree. Wounded spirit on the wind. Riding to his dream and destiny. He's laughing at the wanted posters. Calling for his friends to see. Laughing aloud as he rides away. Kicking up the dust with speed. Time hands him down a pathway. And freedom is a horse he rides. Glory is a dream he's after. And fortune is his heart's delight. Riding swift and secretly. So he'll miss the hanging tree. Wounded spirit on the wind. Riding to his dream and destiny. ."

Happy Birthday to you .... Then at the dead of midnight. As we watched the dancing firelight. The air grew cold. And seemed to dull the flame. The fire died. The music faded. Filled with fear of death we waited. For now we knew. Some evil was to blame. I challenge you. I challenge you all. For all you own. And all you know. And I own the powers of darkness. I will steal what is mine. Surrender now or face my spite. I grant you it may be Friday night. But did you know this day. Also numbers thirteen. First I'll give you fire. I turn your fire into a sleepy stream. Yes, now I give you nightmares. From your horror I'll create a dream. You cannot fight me. For I have the sword of hate. But one thing you can't see. My answer is simply. An impenetrable fortress. Of love ... love ... love .... The fear went as quickly as it came. The air was clear. The fire burned again. The flames leapt. The organ played. The swans sang. To greet the day. And then we knew that. Love will find love will find love ..."

the park,"Let me walk a while alone. Among the sacred rocks and stones. Let me look in vain belief. Upon the beauty of each leaf. There is green in every blade. The tree tops lean providing shade. Maypoles spin in happy sound. All nature's strength around. And there's a horse that feels no pain. Its iron strength to take the strain. Children rock it to and fro. And gaily drink its colour-glow. Above, the sky, devoid of cloud. Thinks not to cast a thunder shroud. Upon this place so full of joy. A field of gold of loves employ. So, why my heavy heart? You say. When tears would stain. The sights so gay. My brother's dreams once here did soar. Until he died at the hand. Of needless war. ."

time to live,"Let me see the sunshine. Let me feel the rain. Let me go where I wanna go. I wanna smell the flowers. See the dawn again. Find those friends I used to know. Well, I spent twenty long years. In a dirty old prison cell. I never saw the light of day. If you could understand. Oh, that kind of living hell. That's the price I have to pay. That's the price I have to pay. They say I killed a man. But I never told them why. So you can guess. What I've been through. So for twenty long years. I've been thinking of that other guy. And what I saw him do to you. What I saw him do to you. Listen here. So if tomorrow comes. And I walk outside that door. Try to understand the strain. But if you smile that smile. I know I couldn't ask for more. I know I'd do it all again. Yes, I would. I know I'd do it all again. ."

too scared to run,"Too scared I could not run. I could not make a sound. Lights were flashing. My whole life passing. My feet were stuck to the ground. Too light to call it night. Too dark to call it day. Too scared to stay and fight. Too scared to run away. So scared I could not move. I could not make a sound. There were people running. People shouting. Flashes all around.

My whole life passing. My heart, my heart. My heart was racing. My legs were shaking. Could not see, I could not see. ."
trail of diamonds,"I had a dream at daybreak. The whole of time stood still. And in my crystal vision. I saw a shadow on a hill. And then she started walking. In to the bright blue sky. I tried to follow closely. And I knew the reason why. Then the dream it turned so slowly. Like a dream within a dream. She appeared to me so ghostly. As she kissed me with a smile. And then I saw her falling. In to the strangest town. Our distance never changing. As the walls are crashing down. Then the dream it moved so slowly. Like a dream within a dream. Then she turned to me so ghostly. And she kissed me with a smile. Like a secret that the heart makes. Must be careful what I wish for. Could this dream, last forever. Until the end of time?. With a vision of ecstasy. Need the strength so, I can hold on. Don’t want to die before I wake up. I had a dream at daybreak. You came and touched my soul. The deepest sense of wonder. Is knowing how to lose control. We left the ground together. So easy for us to fly. Leaving a trail of diamonds. That were seen for miles and miles. So the dream that moved so slowly. Was a dream within a dream. Then she turned to me so holy. And she kissed me with a smile"

Where children laugh without fear. The land will speak. The people will listem. But yesterday my life was fading. With every reason to die. Ten miles to the north. As I rode my red horse. In the dying sun. And then when I saw. The white soldiers. One hundred or more in a line. Kill for the land. Saying their law will stand. What king of god do they see?. The fighting is over. No matter what fear they might bring. My country will live. The dust clouds are falling. I stood by the river. And breathingthe air that is life. Within the black hills. My spiritual calling. What king of god can this be?

Such truth and peace. As we can feel. Free from this waking world. Deep in sleep's mystery. My will is free to wander. Free to wander carelessly. At times it's not so far. From what we call reality. And at times I know I wonder. If it all could come true. Oh, Mr. Wonderworld. Don't be afraid. 'Cause dreams were made. Were made to dim the light. The torment day can bring. And leave you free. To laugh aloud and hear. Your heart bells ring. Oh, oh, Mr. Wonderworld. Wonderworld. Oh, Mr. Wonderworld. Don't be afraid. 'Cause your dreams were made. They were made to dim the light. The torment day can bring. And leave you free. To laugh aloud and hear. Your heart bells ring. Oh, oh, Mr. Wonderworld. Mr. Wonderworld. Mr. Wonderworld. ."
words in the distance,"(LOVE AWARENESS). Dancing with danger and. Tears in my eyes. Love ain't no stranger. So many goodbyes. Words in the distance. Are calling me. Just when I thought. I could make a a new start. Here comes another fire. Burning in my heart. Words in the distance. Are calling me. And to get to heaven. You gotta go through hell. I cut my heart on the wishing well. You know that I'm crazy. I'm just a fool. To say I love I love I love you. You know that I'm crazy, just a fool. To say I love I love I love you. My senses burning from. The heat of your skin. Deeper than deep. I feel you movin' in, oh. Words in the distance. Are calling me. You know that I'm crazy. I'm just a fool. To say I love I love I love you, well. You know that I'm crazy, just a fool. To say I love I love I love you. I love you. I hold this moment of magic. I hold it in my hand. A single moment of heaven. Don't you know that I'm crazy. I'm just a fool. To say I love I love I love you, yeah. You know that I'm crazy, just a fool. To say I love I love I love you. Don't you know I love you baby. Can't you feel it in my heart, yeah. And I don't know what to say, no. Well I've got a fire in my soul. I don't know which way to go. Or I don't know what to do, no."
your love,Your love .... Iâ€™ve got to do it. Gotta find a direction in my life. You canâ€™t have me through it. I know that you do it. But itâ€™s my fight. Why donâ€™t you leave me alone. To drive down this windinâ€™ road. Iâ€™m alive. It just doesnâ€™t feel the same. For my love for you has changed. But your love. It never leaves me alone. For your love. Is in the world of its own. But your love. It never leaves me alone. Youâ€˜re sayinâ€™ that you need me. But the words donâ€™t come easy. Just hold on. I know that I lied. When I told you goodbye. Just keep hanginâ€™ on. Time wonâ€™t keep waitingâ€™. Iâ€™ve gotta do something with my life. You canâ€™t have me through it. But I know that do it. But itâ€™s my fight. .
your turn to remember,"I was always the one. Who did the thinkin'. It was me, I'm sorry. I who made the plans. There was never a thought. We might do somethinâ€™ between us. It's so clear I think. I'm beginning to understand. I was the one who had to. Lay it out and pay it out. I would work all night. Even though I wanted to. Play out and stay out. Now it's your turn to remember. And it's your turn. To try to understand. But you never would, would you?. When the time came. For stayin' together. You refused to even. Talk about for ever. It was easy telling me. You love me. And I was a little late in. Finding out the truth. The rule of love was there. You had to bend it. Now the damage is done. It's impossible to mend it. I canâ€™t mend it. Now it's your turn to remember. It's your turn to feel a little pain. I feel a little better. Talkin' about her. Yet her memory's not good for me. The skies are not so grey now. I've found a new tune to play now. It's a better song. It'll be followin' on. And when the time came. For stayin' together. You refused to even. Talk about for ever. It was easy telling me. You love me. And I was a little late in. Finding out the truth. The rule of love was there. But you had to bend it. Now the damage is done. It's impossible to mend it. You know I canâ€™t mend it. Come on babe. It's your turn to remember. Your turn to feel a little pain. ."
