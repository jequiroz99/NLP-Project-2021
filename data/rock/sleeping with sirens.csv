Now it's our turn. We had to learn the hard way. Because all we ever want is gold. We made our mistakes. It's not too late. We had to learn the hard way. . [Verse 2]. It's two in the morning.

madnesss,"All of my life I built this armor. And every disguise I ever wore. Ashes and dust. I made an island. Facing the end. I said, ""What for? "". Sometimes it's a battle. At times it's a war. But you're never defenseless. Sometimes we all lose strength. Please don't lose your faith. After our time has passed. We're like light through stained glass. We go on and on and on. In the end we're never gone. Out of the skies I shaped the silence. And from the earth I carved these walls. A piece of the world was only mine. And then I said I wanted more. At the edge of the blackness. When you're stretched to the core. Catch hold of the madness. Sometimes we all lose strength. Please don't lose your faith in me. After our time has passed. We're like light through stained glass. We go on and on and on. In the end we're never gone. I will be yours to trust. This is not the last of us. We go on and on and on. In the end we're never gone. Or erased. Please don't lose your faith. Please don't lose your faith. In me. In me"

trouble,"Hard to see when your eyes are closed. Hard to love when your heart is broken. Live my life out in the cold. Days are gone and now I'm frozen. The wind it blows. Where it stops? Nobody's gonna know (I said). Away we go, where do we stop?. Nobody's gonna know, nobody's gonna know. I'm in too deep, I sold my soul. I'm out of reach and I can't let go. I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble. I made my way, a dead end road. I can't turn back so I walk alone. I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble. I'm in, I'm in trouble, trouble. Hard to breathe when you lose control. Hard to live with the words unspoken. I walk away cause I got no home. Empty hole and my body's shaking. The wind will blow. Where it stops? Nobody's gonna know (I said). Away we go, where do we stop?. Nobody's gonna know, nobody's gonna know. I'm in too deep, I sold my soul. I'm out of reach and I can't let go. I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble. I made my way, a dead end road. I can't turn back so I walk alone. I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble. I'm in, I'm in trouble. (Take me heaven, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm in). Trouble. (Save me, yeah). You're so respectable, and I'm so impossible. We just can't have it all. No, no, we just can't have it all. We were invincible, it's almost criminal. No light at the end of the tunnel when you get yourself in trouble. I'm in too deep, I sold my soul. I'm out of reach and I can't let go. I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble. I made my way, a dead end road. I can't turn back so I walk alone. I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble. I'm in, I'm in trouble. (How did I get myself in?). Trouble. (How did I get myself in?). Trouble.

war,This house of lies is stained in blood. Been tearing down our monuments. And now our hope has turned to fear. And it all seems so unclear. A brother kills his own tonight. When will we know our wrong from right?. To me it seems that we have lost our sight. When we're blinded by our rights (And this is so surreal). There's a cold hard rain on the mountain top. Like a speeding train that'll never stop. Just a twist of a knife for a bastard son. It's a mother's love in a war that can't be won. In a war that can't be won. Poison water from the well to drink. Shots rain down in our city streets. And are we the land of the free?. Was it made for you and me? (And this is so surreal). There's a cold hard rain on the mountain top. Like a speeding train that'll never stop. Just a twist of a knife for a bastard son. It's a mother's love in a war that can't be won. In a war that can't be won. It can't be won. In a war that can't be won. Take the weight off your shoulders. Our cross is to bear is to bear. There's a black sun rising. You can feel it in the air. When we make our way to those pearly gates. Will we walk right in?. This is judgement day. And it's a cold hard rain on the mountain top. Like a speeding train that'll never stop. Just a twist of a knife for a bastard son. It's a mother's love in a war that can't be won. In a war that can't be won. It can't be won. In a war that can't be won. It can't be won

who are you now?,"Yeah, yeah. Don’t wake me up if I’m sleeping this life away. Tell me that I’ll never be good enough. Sometimes it hurts to think it could really be that way. It won’t be that way.

Won’t you fight back for what you want?. Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly. We’re gonna work it out. Yeah, yeah. Don’t, don’t, don’t wake me up. ‘Cause I hate who I am today. So come on, come on. And just take, take, take what you want. Is it now what we’re living for?. We’re always wanting more. You made me hate my own reflection. Question every choice I make. So I could try to be perfect. But I will try to be fake. So forgive me ‘cause I really could care less that. This world has changed me. So you know when you ask me. Who are you now?. Did you say what you want?. Don’t go back to the start. I’m asking, who are you now?. Did they break you apart?. Won’t you fight back for what you want?. Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly. And sometimes you really live, you’ve gotta try. We can change it all together, in the end you’re gonna find. That what we felt in our hearts was real the whole time. When you open up your eyes, I hope that you find. Who you are, who you are. Who are you now?. Who are you now?. Who are you now?. Did you say what you want?. Don’t go back to the start.
