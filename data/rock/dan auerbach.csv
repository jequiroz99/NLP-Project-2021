malibu man,I moved from New York. With my boogie board. And bought a big house on the ocean. I stopped being me. I took the shoes off my feet. Just because I took the notion. My hair gave in so my beard came out. Caused quite a face of commotion. It grew past my lips and then it covered my mouth. So no one could read my emotions. Malibu Man. Isn't life great. Got the world in his hands. Malibu Man. Sometimes I get up. But I'm feeling down. I don't have a sister or brother. No family no wife. But I'm still living my life. Just step from a stone to another. I'm a myth of man. I ride the waves when I can. I make the music so people will buy it. I take pride in my ways. And my colossal duvets. I'm just an old fashion retailers riot. Malibu Man. Isn't life great. Got the world in his hands. Malibu Man
king of a one horse town,Everyday is just a little white lie. Telling myself I'm gettin' by. I just stay in this room and cry. The snow it covers up the ground. And I can't hear a single sound. I'd turn off the TV and go for a drive. But I can't see there's any signs of life. Kept a Christmas tree with blinking lights. I coulda made it but I messed around. I'm a loser with a rusty crown. Scared if I jump in the ocean I might drown. King of a One Horse Town. I'm the King of a One Horse Town. And I barely pull my weight around. I thought about leaving but I don't know. Wouldn't even know anywhere to go. Guess I'll stay on desolation row. Go get stoned and hang around. The beat of my drum is the only sound. I would jump into the ocean but I'm scared I'd drown.

never in my wildest dreams,Never in my wildest dreams. Would I be loving you. Never in my wildest dreams. Would my dreams come true. You're just too good to touch. I can't discuss it much. I get too choked up. Don't wanna make a scene. Never in my wildest dreams. Never in my wildest dreams. Would I roam this land. Sail across the seven seas. I'm a hard luck man. But I know what my purpose is. It ain't no some pilgrimage. Its wherever my baby is. My love supreme. Never in my wildest dreams. Walk in the cold cold wind. Carry my laundry bin. Take my recs for a spin. Watch daytime tv. You're just too good to touch. And I can't discuss it much. I get too choked up. Don't wanna make a scene. Never in my wildest dreams
waiting on a song,I've been thinking. I've been humming. I've been picking. And I've been strumming. Just waiting. Waiting on a song. I've been hitching. I've been thumbing.

Am I blind or too dumb to see?. All the sounds surrounding me. I'm just waiting. Waiting on a song. You can look up at the stars. Bow your head and count the cars. You'll still be waiting. Waiting on a song. Might be a blue bird or a crow. On a cord between two posts. They're just waiting. Waiting on a song. Songs don't blow on trees. You gotta pick them out the breeze. You fall down on your knees. And pray one comes along. When those railroad gates come down. You gotta stop and turn around. Or you'll be waiting. Waiting on a song. You'll be waiting. Waiting on a song

I saw the streets all ripe with jewels. Balconies and the laundry lines. They tried to make me welcome there. But their streets did not feel like mine. So long, I'm goin', goin' home. I want the sun to hit my face. Through oak trees in the open lot. Forget about the things you want. Be thankful for what all you got. So long, I'm goin', goin' home"

Can he drive all night and never stop. Well I guess you'll have to wait and see. (Chorus). I heard a voice, call to me. Saying someday you're gonna be free. . Put a dollar in the jukebox.

I should have quit a long time ago. I hear words, in my sleep. Promises you made but never keep. Even in my dreams. I try to fight but I don't ever win. (Bridge repeat)"
