love hurts,"Love hurts, Love scars, Love wounds' and marks. Any heart not tough or strong enough. To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain. Love is like a cloud, it holds a lot of rain. Love hurts, Ooo-oo Love hurts. I'm young, I know, But even so. I know a thing or two - I learned from you. I really learned a lot, really learned a lot. Love is like a flame It burns you when it's hot. Love hurts, Ooo-oo Love hurts. Some fools think of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness. Some fools fool themselves, I guess. They're not foolin' me. I know it isn't true I know it isn't true. Love is just a lie made to make you blue. Love hurts, Ooo-oo Love hurts. I know it isn't true I know it isn't true. Love is just a lie made to make you blue. Love hurts, Ooo-oo Love hurts. Ooo-oo, Love hurts Ooo-oo. I know it isn't true I know it isn't true. Love is just a lie made to make you blue. Love hurts, Ooo-oo Love hurts. Ooo-oo, Love hurts Ooo-oo"
where are you now,Every single day. I think of the times. When you were still mine. And I’m blue. Got to get away. Get you out of my mind. I’m caught up in time. And I’m blue. I don’t miss all the fun that we had. You were always around me. Where are you now. I need you now. If you were around. It would be alright. Living on my own. I know I’m to blame. I’m locked in my chains. And you’re free. Fallen like a stone. I’m down on the ground. I’m tied up and bound. And you’re free. I don’t miss all the fun that we had. You were always around me. Where are you now. I need you now. If you were around it would be alright. repeat * (2x)
love leads to madness,"Do I feel alright?. I'll go anywhere you say you wanna to take me. Save me, run away-ay-ay, steal away-ay-ay. 'Cause I feel alright. I'll do anything you say you wanna make me. Take me, far away-ay-ay, run away-ay-ay. We've been up all night. Tryin' to avoid a situation. Hold me, let me feel your way. 'Cause I wanna stay. Let them all start talkin'. We won't give ourselves away. Our love leads to madness. Our love leads to madness. Our love leads to madness. Do you feel alright?. An' can you see me when you're lookin' in your mirror. Crazy, try to find a way, so your heart don't pay. Run away-ay-ay. Don't you give yourself away. Our love leads to madness. Our love leads to madness. Our love leads to madness. Our lova leads to madness. . (written by Nazareth). copyright 1982 Fool Circle Music Limited. lyrics used by permission. all rights reserved."

star,"Walking alone at night in the cold rain. Wondering if I will see you again. In some corner light. Running down the road in the warm sun. Dreaming that I am still the one. Resting by your side. Chorus:. You took the road to fortune and fame. Your name in lights. I want you to know I still feel the same. Star, I still love you. I still love you. Remembering when you played me that first song. The first show that you asked me along. Just to be around. Working so hard 'till you got that first break. You said you could turn them around. Give them something new. (Chorus:). Got that photograph of you and me. I hear your voice on the radio. Will I ever lay with you again. Nobody planned it, we just seem to drift now. I always seem to have to leave. Just as you come around. But someday soon girl I just got to see you. I just gotta find out. If we still have time. (Chorus:)"

this flight tonight,"Look out the left the captain said. The lights down there that's where we'll land. Saw a falling star burning. High above the Las Vegas sand. It wasn't the one that you gave to me. That night down south between the trailers. Not the early one that you wish upon. Not the northern one that guides in the sailors. You've got that touch so gentle and sweet. But you've got that look so critical. Can't talk to you babe you know I get so weak. Sometimes I think that love is just mythical. Up there's a heaven, down there's a town. Blackness everywhere any little lights shine. Blackness, blackness draggin' me down. Come on light a candle in this heart of mine. Starbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I like. Turn this crazy bird around. Should not have got on this flight tonight. I'm drinkin' sweet champagne got the headphones up high. Can't numb you, can't drum you out of my mind. They're singin'-""Goodbye baby,. Baby bye-bye,. Ooh! love is blind"". Up go the flaps,down go the wheels. Hope you got your heat turned on baby.

alcatraz,Now lay me down on market street. I’m lookin’ for some spare change. A coast guard ship has been lookin’ for me. And I might have to change my name. Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans. The local chief’s on the radio. He’s got some hungry mouths to feed. Goin back to Alcatraz. Lay me back down here on the highway. One hundred and one ways to go. Solitary is so confinin’. To the legend of Geronimo. Oh I know I could bring the rain. Used to dance for ABC. And all the braves down on death row. Are pretending to be free. Back home in Alcatraz. In the land of the great white father. My American blood runs cold. I left my home in Oklahoma. To the Everglades I go. It’s just the wings on the silver cars. And I’m allowed to plow a field. It’s not the life for a nineteen seventy. (What's an)Indian boy to do. Goin’ back to Alcatraz. Lay me down on market street. I’m lookin for some spare change. A coast guard ship has been lookin’ for me. Might have to change my name. Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans. Local chief’s on the radio. He’s got some hungry mouths to feed. Goin’ back to Alcatraz. Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans. Local chief’s on the radio. He’s got some hungry mouths to feed.

showdown at the border,"His necktie is bright red. From lookin' in one direction. No flowerchild in his bed. He's got oil well protection. Just had to be a blind dog. Chewin' on everything.

Ten gallons on your head. That ain't what I need tonight. Showdown at the border. Showdown at the border. Showdown at the border. Bright red went to his head. Tequila tension rising.

back to the trenches,"Presidents and peace spreading poets. Getting gunned down in the streets. Shown to us on our prime time screens. For our tea time treat. Lunatics we voted for denying. Everything that they swore. We sit around and shout about it. But we don't do nothing more. Drafted for police action. But they decided on a war. Telling us we were saving mankind. Why don't you ask Cambodia. We were solving it with marijuana. We were sure that we could. Always leavin' it to someone else. Just knocking on wood. We're goin' back to the trenches. We're goin' back to the trenches. Well you say you got a say so. But you're knowin' that it ain't so. And you turn away. You think it's safer to ignore it. But the score is your children have to pay. Everybody wants better. Everybody talkin' 'bout it. Are we wastin' time. Gotta stop only lookin', talkin'. We're all guilty of the crime. We're goin' back to the trenches. We're goin' back to the trenches. We gotta move, we got everything to lose. We gotta move, we got everything to lose. We're all headed for the front. But everybody's fightin' for a good address. It's time we made the changes. Or we'll be burnin' with the rest. We just ain't communicatin' and I don't. Mean conversations on the telephone. When Nero starts to fiddle this time. There's a lot more gonna burn than Rome. we're goin' back to the trenches. we're goin' back to the trenches. we're goin' back to the trenches. we're goin' back to the trenches. .

broken down angel,"She used to be someone you could depend on. To brighten up your coldest winter day. But the one she leaned upon. Let her down, noow has moved on. And morning brings another empty day. Now she’s only a broken down angel. She’s only a bird that’s broke her wing. She’s only someone, somone who’s gone wrong. She’s only a child that’s lost her way. She used to be a girl of simple pleasures. A breath of spring to chase your blues away. But now she bears a cross, for a love that she has lost. No sunshine in her life just clouds of gray. Now she’s only a broken down angel. She’s only a bird that’s broke her wing. She’s only someone, somone who’s gone wrong. She’s only a child that’s lost her way. She’s only a broken down angel. She’s only a bird that’s broke her wing. She’s only someone, somone who’s gone wrong. She’s only a child that’s lost her way. Now she’s only a broken down angel.

hit the fan,"Why don't you tell me that it's over. Why do you keep this hangin' on. Pack up your bags and run for cover. Say what you mean and see it done. Why don't you cut me loose, you don't need me. Lift up your dress and walk away. There's nothin' left you can say to please me. You're just a dog who's had it's day. You beat around the bush and mumble. About the good old days we had. Your face grows longer as you crumble. You had the good now taste the bad. Let it all hit the fan. Let it all hit the fan. You promised me nothing would change you. More empty words from an empty soul. The same old stories you still cling to. The truth be told you leave me cold. You used to lead the dance and fumble. Howl in the night you could not sleep. You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled. Too many promises come cheap.. . (Manny Charlton). publishing copyright: Elgin Music."

another year,"So your plane was late. You missed that date. And your horse can't win. So you drink another bottle of gin. And your shares went down. They touched the ground. And your best laid plans.

Think about those who'll never see another year. Think about them. Think about those who never saw. So your car won't start. Needs a special part. But you made your choice. Now you're stuck with all your big boys toys. Now the word's around. You've gone aground. And you've lost your wind. You'll never see your ship come in. Think about them, think about them. Think about those who'll never see another year. Think about them. Think about those who'll never see another year. Mother's, father's. Sister's, brother's. Old man, young man. Whale song, all gone. Where did we go wrong. Think about those who'll never see another. Those who'll never see another. Those who'll never see. Think about them, think about them.. (Charlton)."
"telegram, pts. 1 & 4","Sent a telegram today. Tomorrow you'll be on your way. Could be Memphis or L.A.. No questions just get out and play.. Wake up call to catch the plane. You know you're on the road again. Someone's bangin' in your head. Why did you get so late to bed.. Runnin' late and feelin' bad. That breakfast was the worst you've had. Make the gate no time to spare. Before you know you're in the air.. 747 flies us high. Much higher than we're meant to be. You're six miles high but feelin' down. You wish you could be on the ground.. Find your bags and walk for miles. The customs man is waitin' there. Immigration cause delay. You wonder if you'll ever play.. Limousine is standin' by. We get inside and drive a while. F.M. Station soundin' good. And gettin' better every mile.. Hotel lobby looks the same. With all the same old girls in town. Press reception takes the day. With all the same old things to say. Need your picture smile this way. And will you tell me what you play. So you wanna be a rock'n'roll star. Just listen now to what I say. Get yourself an electric guitar. and take some time and learn to play.. Your roadies call to say OK. The soundcheck can get underway. Soundcheckover, had some fun. A waste of time for everyone. Time has come to start the show. It's boogie time for everyone. Check guitars before you go. They're close enough for rock n roll. The lights are low,. The crowd is high,much higher than. They're meant to be. We take the stage and start to play. The lights come up for all to see. Here we are again, singin' the same old songs. Lookin for someone who will sing along. Here we are again playin' the same old scenes. Lookin'for someone who will share our dreams. Here we are again facing the same old sights. Lookin' for someone who will share our nights"
1692(glen coe massacre),"(copyright Nazareth, Tiflis Tunes,inc.-ascap). . Mist upon the hill can remember murder,. Mist upon the hill that once flowed with blood,. Helped to cover up an approaching army,. Hid the killing lust in the eyes of men.. Sitting by the fire was a sentry sleeping,. Rolled up in their beds were children that play,. Unsuspecting what was to fall upon them,. None of them would see the dawn next day.. Bloody were the blades that fell on children,. Hate the blinding light tried to kill a name,. The mountains only know all the souls that died there,. Glen Coe from that day can recall the shame.. The quiet of the night never gave them warning,. The silence of the hills wouldn't let them know,. They'd never rise again on a mist filled morning,. Never see the sunrise above Glen Coe.."

You had a brother in the movement and he burned his card. He's got a job in the white house, ain't life hard. You came back a hero on a stolen horse. You say you don't fit in, you can't stay the course. I may be right, don't care if I'm wrong. It's a veteran's song. I may be right, don't care if I'm wrong. It's a veteran's song. The band paraded playing ""Oh gung ho"""". Your country needs you, you've got to go. When you came over they said ""Soldier go back"". When you came home they put you on the rack. Between agent orange and the jungle and fear. You're just surviving to get out of here. You smoke some more herb and you keep your head down. Could be your number is on the next round.. .

One hundred and one ways to go. Solitary is so confinin’. To the legend of Geronimo. Oh I know I could bring the rain. Used to dance for ABC. And all the braves down on death row. Are pretending to be free. Back home in Alcatraz. In the land of the great white father. My American blood runs cold. I left my home in Oklahoma. To the Everglades I go. It’s just the wings on the silver cars. And I’m allowed to plow a field. It’s not the life for a nineteen seventy. (What's an)Indian boy to do. Goin’ back to Alcatraz. Lay me down on market street. I’m lookin for some spare change. A coast guard ship has been lookin’ for me. Might have to change my name. Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans. Local chief’s on the radio. He’s got some hungry mouths to feed. Goin’ back to Alcatraz. Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans. Local chief’s on the radio. He’s got some hungry mouths to feed.

Have slipped right out of your hands. So you think you're fat. Well that's a fact. But your well ran dry. So you had to walk another mile. Think about them, think about them.

back to school,"You didnâ€™t listen when you went to school. You dressed like a clown and you behaved like a fool. But now your education is about to begin.

Sheâ€™ll shoot you down and put your feet on the ground. Itâ€™s not like dreaminâ€™ you can make mistakes. A lesson learned is not so easy to take. Now youâ€™re going back to school.

back to the trenches,"Presidents and peace spreading poets. Getting gunned down in the streets. Shown to us on our prime time screens. For our tea time treat. Lunatics we voted for denying.

Why don't you ask Cambodia. We were solving it with marijuana. We were sure that we could. Always leavin' it to someone else. Just knocking on wood. We're goin' back to the trenches. We're goin' back to the trenches. Well you say you got a say so. But you're knowin' that it ain't so. And you turn away. You think it's safer to ignore it. But the score is your children have to pay. Everybody wants better. Everybody talkin' 'bout it. Are we wastin' time. Gotta stop only lookin', talkin'. We're all guilty of the crime. We're goin' back to the trenches. We're goin' back to the trenches. We gotta move, we got everything to lose. We gotta move, we got everything to lose. We're all headed for the front. But everybody's fightin' for a good address. It's time we made the changes. Or we'll be burnin' with the rest. We just ain't communicatin' and I don't. Mean conversations on the telephone. When Nero starts to fiddle this time.

You're drivin' me half crazy. Can't make up my mind what to do about you.. Tellin' myself that time is on my side. You're gettin' this feelin' that my mind's on the slide.

Watch all my cares sail away. I have no ties my hands are unbound. There is no friend no love I have found. I have no ups I'm fixed to the ground

enough love,You give without takin’. I take what I need. I need what you’re givin’. You give me belief. And when I wake in the morning baby. I feel the strength renew. To face the world on the outside maybe. Cause on the inside is you. It’s been a long road travelled on. It’s been a long road home. I’ve got enough love now. I’ve got enough love now. I’ve got enough. I’ve got enough love. I’ve got enough love now. The way that you love me. The light in your smile. All pleasure you give me. On the extra mile. And when I think that I’m fallin’ honey. You’re my safety net. The world doesn’t scare me no way. Can there be more love left. I’ve got enough love now. I’ve got enough love now. I’ve got enough. I’ve got enough love. I’ve got enough love now. It’s been a long road travelled on. It’s been a long road home. I’ve got enough love now. I’ve got enough love now. I’ve got enough. I’ve got enough love. I’ve got enough love now. I’ve got enough love now…. I’ve got enough love now…. I’ve got enough love now…. I’ve got enough love now…. I’ve got enough love. . Bruna.Chan ;)
every young man's dream,"She was my guiding light. She was my day and night. I hung on every word, no matter wrong or right. She could raise me up to heights I've never seen.

everytime it rains,"No feeling when you told me goodbye. No reason when youâ€™re living a lie. Donâ€™t tell me what I already know. Iâ€™m living memories of long ago. I fool myself, I deny it all. Wanna hide it away. Lost moments never caring enough. I was never good at playing it tough. Still living in my own little world. Still believing youâ€™re the only one. Itâ€™s always hard, never easier. To face another day alone. Every time it rains I fall apart. I start to remember. Every single time it rains. I think of you.. . (Rankin). Bob â€˜nâ€™ Weave Music."

And you think you know the score. No you don't wanna listen. You can't be told no more. But wait'll you get out there. You better do it right. 'Cause the streets are lined with things that kill. And they're hidin' in the night. Expect no mercy, expect no mercy. Expect no mercy, expect no mercy. Expect no mercy, expect no mercy. Expect no mercy, expect no mercy. Feel that you can cut it. You think you got the time. They'll only give you one chance. Better get it right first time. And the game you're playing. If you lose you gotta pay. If you make just one wrong move. You'll get blown away. Expect no mercy, expect no mercy. Expect no mercy, expect no mercy. Expect no mercy, expect no mercy. Expect no mercy, expect no mercy.

flying,Here I am flying. Looking down at mother earth below. Above me only blue skies. Below me is a cotton candy world. Here I am dreaming. Plane I’m on flies gently as a bird. Captain said something. But I never heard single word. Here I am flying. Look above you. I’ll be watching you. Maybe you won’t see me. But soon I’ll be flying. Soon I’ll be flying home to you. Gazing at the sunrise. Homeland sure looks green far down below. Now we’re almost landed. I can see the hostess by the door. Here I am flying. Look above you. I’ll be watching you. Maybe you won’t see me. But soon I’ll be flying. Soon I’ll be flying home to you. Won’t be long ‘till I see. Bridges on our river. Looking at the old familiar lights. Won’t be long ‘till we’ll be. Making up for countless sleepless nights. Here I am flying. Looking down at mother earth below. Above me only blue skies. Below me is a cotton candy world. Here I am flying. Look above you. I’ll be watching you. Maybe you won’t see me. But soon I’ll be flying. Soon I’ll be flying home to you.

Or a verse with no rhyme, just a fool about you.. Sometimes I feel like a bird with no wing,. Or a bee with no sting,. Sometimes I feel like a train with no line,.

gloria,I had it all. Or I thought so anyway. And then there came the day. When I knew I’d been deceived. It was tailor made. The hole I’d dug myself. That morning they came knocking. ‘Couldn’t blame nobody else. You make mistakes. Then you make them all again. And find yourself deserted. By the people you called friends. All it takes. Is for one deal to go bad. You’re signing your confession. As they take all that you have. And all this years spent sitting here. Waiting to be free. My day has come. And I can finally see. Gloria –ah –ah –ah –ah. Gloria –ah –ah –ah -ah. Gloria –ah –ah –ah -ah. I’ve dreamed of waking. Up beyond that wall. It looks like I might make it after all. There’s a kid in here. Reminds me of my son. I watch him with the others. When they laugh about what they’ve done. So many ways. To impress one so young. The day they let him out of here. He’s gonna find himself a gun. I tried to say. Tried to make him understand. Fear is not respect. And it won’t make a boy a man. Oh you make them all again. It seems that I offended. One of those godforsaken men. In all these years spent sitting here. That last thing that I see. Is a baby face. With a blade that’s made for me. Gloria –ah –ah –ah –ah. Gloria –ah –ah –ah -ah. Gloria –ah –ah –ah -ah. I guess some things were. Never meant to be. Gloria –ah –ah –ah –ah. Gloria –ah –ah –ah -ah. Gloria –ah –ah –ah –ah. So open up that gate and. Welcome me. My spirits flown. And I’m finally free. Finally free… Yeah!

hard living,"Hard living, every day of my life. Hard living, every night on the wine. Never givin', any one any time. Always losin', all I had all the time. Yes I'm a selfish kinda man. All I need is a helping hand. Bad loser, never had anyone. Bad chooser, never owed never won. Fast mover, everyday on the run. Never knowing, if I feel or I'm done. Hard living, every day of my life. Hard drinking, every night on the wine. . (Agnew, Charlton, McCafferty, Sweet). Mountain Music/Carlin Music. 1972 Nazareth (Dunfermline) Ltd.."
heart's grown cold,"Go out and have your habit,. Keep on takin' it. Keep on fakin' it. You're the one whose heart grows cold. You're the one whose heart's grown cold.. Go out and have your habit.

helpless,There is a town in north Ontario. Dream comfort memory despair. And in my mind I still need a place to hide. All my changes were there. Blue blue windows behind the stars. Yellow moon on the rise. Big birds flying across the skies. Casting shadows in our eyes. Leave us helpless helpless helpless helpless. Helpless helpless they leave me now. Helpless helpless helpless. Blue blue windows behind the stars. Yellow moon on the rise. They leave us. Helpless helpless helpless helpless. Helpless helpless they leave me now. Helpless helpless helpless. Helpless helpless helpless helpless. Helpless helpless they leave me now. (NEIL YOUNG). COPYRIGHT WARNER/CHAPPELL.
hire and fire,"It was a night, it was just another night. She was sayinâ€™ lots of nothing. She was none too bright. But youâ€™ll listen much to anythinâ€™. When anythinâ€™s in sight, wonâ€™t ya!. Double back trouble like a temperance hall. Sheâ€™s dealinâ€™ with the ceilinâ€™. And the writings on the wall. Then youâ€™re wishing it was over, like an endless fall.. Itâ€™s a lane side fight. Oh no! another main line ride. Oh no! there ainâ€™t a train in sight. Oh no! settinâ€™ my soul on fire. Try her and buy her. Hire and fire her. Playinâ€™ the game his latest flame. Now itâ€™s a fine line between passion and dread. Foolinâ€™ and a droolinâ€™. Starts rulinâ€™ your head. To seduction, destruction. Weâ€™re so easily lead. And then the dawn, the so impatient telephone. The smell of disappointment. Mirror wants to pick a bone. Itâ€™s a cup of cold coffee. Like the taste of stale beer. Letâ€™s get outta here. Itâ€™s a lane side fight. Oh no! another main line ride. Oh no! there ainâ€™t a train in sight. Oh no! settinâ€™ my soul on fire. Try her and buy her. Hire and fire her. Carry the flame and make it last. Carry the blame and kiss your ass goodbye.. (written by Rankin, McCafferty, Agnew). Bobâ€™nâ€™Weave Music (Dunfermline)."
hit the fan,"Why don't you tell me that it's over. Why do you keep this hangin' on. Pack up your bags and run for cover. Say what you mean and see it done. Why don't you cut me loose, you don't need me. Lift up your dress and walk away. There's nothin' left you can say to please me. You're just a dog who's had it's day. You beat around the bush and mumble. About the good old days we had. Your face grows longer as you crumble. You had the good now taste the bad. Let it all hit the fan. Let it all hit the fan. You promised me nothing would change you. More empty words from an empty soul. The same old stories you still cling to. The truth be told you leave me cold. You used to lead the dance and fumble. Howl in the night you could not sleep. You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled. Too many promises come cheap.. . (Manny Charlton). publishing copyright: Elgin Music."

homesick again,"Nazareth. Sad to be alone. Your only comfort is the telephone. Homesick again. Thoughts of far away. Silence is the only way to say. Ain't it a shame. Whatâ€™s goin' down, she don't understand. Can't you be with her every night. Why must it be, you're away so long. But she plays along, and it's alright. People all around. You donâ€™t see or hear them make a sound. It's not the same. Whatâ€™s goin' down, she donâ€™t understand. Can't you be with her every night. Why must it be, you're away so long.

i had a dream,"(copyright Nazareth,Tiflis Tunes,inc.-ascap). I had a dream. I had a dream. I saw the mission band,playing on the green. It was the saddest thing,I have ever seen. What did it mean,what did it all mean?. And in my dream,in my same dream. I saw the soldiers marching,on the green. The band played a funeral march. Many a tear was seen. All in my dream,all in my dream. I heard the lesson read,I heard the choir. I saw the falling leaves,landing everywhere. I saw the family gathered,crying in despair. I was not there,I was not there"

java blues,"Rick Danko. I walked into a diner. And the blonde behind the counter. She asked if she could help in any way. Hell, I knew by her smile. Her number I could dial. If I was in the need of company. But as I bought some Java. Instead she brought me a cup of chicory. I got those Java blues. Coffeeâ€™s got me. Java blues. Oh coffee, coffee, coffee. Java blues. Coffeeâ€™s got me. Java blues. Oh coffee. You know that Iâ€™ll stay high. Iâ€™ll drink coffee â€˜till I die. Donâ€™t pour me water just fill up my cup. You know it takes a lot just to keep me up. Cost may be more than you care to pay. What good is money compared to fightinâ€™ pain. Donâ€™t try to cheat. Itâ€™s impossible to beat. The only pick me up thatâ€™s here to stay. I got those Java blues. Coffeeâ€™s got me. Java blues. Oh coffee, coffee, coffee. Java blues. Oh coffee, oh coffee. Java blues. Coffeeâ€™s got me. You know that Iâ€™ll stay high. Iâ€™ll drink coffee â€˜till I die. The taste of Java is like a cocaine rush. Nobodyâ€™s gonna stop me from drinkinâ€™ too much. Down in Bolivia the people are insane. They want as much for coffee as they do for cocaine. Donâ€™t try to cheat. Itâ€™s impossible to beat. The only pick me up thatâ€™s here to stay. I got those Java blues. Coffeeâ€™s got me. Java blues. Oh coffee, coffee, coffee. Java blues. The coffeeâ€™s got me now... Java blues. Oh coffee, coffee. You know that Iâ€™ll stay high. Iâ€™ll drink coffee â€˜till I die. I got the Java blues.

jet lag,"I'm goin' back to New York city. Times square sure will be shinin' bright. I know it sure looks pretty. But I don't go down every night.. I'm gonna take in Memphis. You know the one down in Tennessee. And if you wanna boogie. Now that's the place to be.. Sittin' in a bar in Macon. Drinkin' something called Rebel Yells. When I thought I heard someone ringing. I guess she's a southern bell.. We just cut out of El Paso. It just fries there in that desert sun. And if you've ever been down there man. Then you know why we run.. I got jet lag. And livin' out an overnight bag. Time changes every day. They do things a different way. Back in the U.S.A.. Tryin' hard to make a phone call. ""Long distance over seas"". ""Yes ma'am I did say Scotland"". ""Could you spell that again for me please"". You know that it just blew my mind. I'd love to go back there next trip. I sure hope we get some time.. Driving down a Detroit freeway. Just lookin' at those concrete walls. Hey but it's a good town to rock'n'roll in. ""What do you mean the police closed the god damned hall?"". Flyin' home tomorrow. To be there's gonna be just great. And after some time with my lady. I'm gonna be back to rock'n'roll in the States.. ."

Thought Iâ€™d try my hand at cards. So I headed for Nevada. Gonna really take them on. But the way the hands were fallinâ€™. And the way the money goes. You could say itâ€™s getting colder. You could say I nearly froze. Lady Luck help me hold on. Lady Luck help me hold on. To one that I love. So I started playing guitar. In a southern boogie band. And the ladies I was meeting. Make you want to buy the farm. Gettinâ€™ tired of saving souvenirs. Donâ€™t remind me where theyâ€™re from. And the nights come on like magic. In the morning itâ€™s all gone.

last exit brooklyn,"When the sun crashes into your world. Look around and you try and find your girl. And you're daring, too sick of what you see. Out of town is the only place to be.

Take your turn to get back on your feet. Feel the wheels singinâ€™ over the ridge. Feel the song like ""Oakland"" take you. All the time you knew you had the itch. All the girls were glad to see you. Last exit Brooklyn... last exit Brooklyn. Girl in ol' won't pray. Don't give you a hard time. All the girls from Brooklyn say. Last exit Brooklyn... last exit Brooklyn. Do you remember the day you left the block. Your mama said you would live to regret it. Coming home, coming stoned, come in hope, coming ready. Are you holding steady. Last exit Brooklyn... last exit Brooklyn... last exit Brooklyn. . (McCafferty, Agnew, Charlton, Sweet)"

liar,You think you’re owed a living. Something ‘bout you family tree. Your daddy was a bad man. You are just a crazy freak. The ship is surely sinking. And history will finger you. For staggering incompetence. And all the things you didn’t do. You’re a Liar. Liar Liar. Liar. Liar Liar. You couldn’t get elected. Without messing with democracy. You should have been arrested. But you you’ve got job security. And weapons in the desert. Dubya knew it wasn’t true. Illiterate. And full of shit. Daddy must be proud of you. You’re a Liar. Liar Liar. Liar. Liar Liar. Liar Liar… Pants on fire. Shamed administration. And you you’re working on sham. There ain’t no climate change. Embarrassing your nation. ‘cause you never gave a damn. About no hurricane.

lift the lid,"Nazareth. Here I am, sitting on my porch. Thinkinâ€™ my life has got to be beyond reproach. Have I forgot some friends close to me. Real ones that donâ€™t use me. And does my woman love me now. Like she loved me then. Here I am,my defenses are down. Will she remember me when Iâ€™m not around. Will she still dream by me. Or will she find a new life. Will I ever get used, to being alone at night. Iâ€™ll never know, but would it do me any good if I did. Life is a strange brew, maybe we should not lift the lid. Lift the lid.

Why are we lonely in the night. We're trapped within our own defenses. The walls we made all look the same. There is no love without affection. We've come to far to break the chain. Something's gone wrong with us. Something ain't right. Why are we lonely in the night. Why are we lonely in the night. I'm growing tired of this deception. We fall apart and wonder why?. Our hearts now pull in new directions. We don't know how to say goodbye. Something's gone wrong with us. Something ain't right. Why are we lonely in the night. Why are we lonely in the night. Something's gone wrong with us. Something ain't right. Why are we lonely in the night. Why are we lonely in the night. .

love of freedom,"It seems to me Iâ€™ve heard that song before. Far off in some distant land. Or it may have been upon some foreign shore. Burning in my heart again.

I would never, ever have seen this day. So please forgive me if I weep no more. For friends and lovers far away. Thereâ€™s been too many times to hear the names. Of friends who have stayed away. Maybe now and then you still recall the pain. As though it was yesterday. Oh but for the love of freedom. Oh but for the love of you. I would never, ever have seen this day.

Blood is running colder. Sinky’s. No tuning back the clock. Memories. It used to mean so much to me. My scene. Won’t make the final cut. Don’t flies. I don’t feel any older. Goodbyes. Are harder than I thought. Bandstand. Find another place to jam. Old friends. Will never be forgot. I can’t believe it’s over. . Bruna.Chan

never dance with the devil,"Take a ride on the wild side. When the sun goes down. Gotta jump on a freight train. Gonna hit this town. Shot down, gotcha with a six gun. There's blood on my hands. Pale rider in a sandstorm. At the crossroads dusty way. Bet your life's gonna take you. Where the wild men roam. Just be careful what you wish for. Gonna shake them bones. I know a place. Got to get away. Never dance with the devil. When the sun goes down. Never dance with the devil. You better leave this town. Never dance with the devil. It's the spirit of the crossbones. Never dance with the devil. The Badlands is our playground. Take a ride on the wild side. There's blood and stone. And be careful what you wish for. It's gonna shake them bones. I know a place. Got to get away. Got caught shot down. The priest is on his way. Never dance with the devil. When the sun goes down. Never dance with the devil. You better leave this town.

new york broken toy,"She came from New York. Seems like a bright spark. Knew all the answers to the game. Moved to a new town. Soon pushed her way around. But you're a lady just the same. She went the wrong way. Tryin' to catch that boy. He only used her. Then broke her like a toy. Like a New York broken toy. Moved with the wrong pack. Hard headed, well stacked. Drop her guard if you drop her name. Made all the wrong moves. Knew all the lines to use. Too many got burned in her flame. She went the wrong way. Tryin' to catch that boy. He only used her. Then he broke her like a toy. Like a New York broken toy. Since the news got around. Someone I brought up town. Needed a friend but no one came. She tried to change her views. But still she wasn't bad news. Don't ever lose at your own game. She went the wrong way. Tryin' to catch that boy. He only used her. Then he broke her like a toy. Like a New York broken toy.. .

night woman,"She’s a night woman of my dreams. And I saw her glidin’ on a moon beam. Silver stardust in her eyes. In the way she leaves her sighs. Last night I fell asleep. Thought I heard her voice begin to speak. My mind is in distress. On my cheek I felt her breath. I could feel her body’s warmin’ glow. My frozen blood begn to flow. She’s a night woman of my dreams. And I saw her glidin’ on a moon beam. Comes, stays, then disappears. In the morning sun my vision clears. I could smell the roses in her hair. But when I awoke she was not there. Oooh, oooh, night woman of my dream. Oooh, oooh, night woman of my dream. Oooh, oooh,She’s a night woman of my dream. Oooh, oooh, night woman of my dream."

Did I realise how easy it was back then. When all of my times was free. When all of my times was free?
rags to riches,"Itâ€™s a sign of the times, standing in line. Quietly waiting to go out of your mind. Thereâ€™s nothing to say, no reason to stay. To fight for the right that they have taken away. Get what you get, not what you need. Time after time. * Rags to riches, all fallen down. Rags to riches, tied up and bound. Thereâ€™s no going under. When youâ€™re kicked to the ground. Rags to riches..rags to riches. Youâ€™re down on your knees, caught in the freeze. Crying inside but thereâ€™s no easy release. Radical views--in yesterday news. Giving the reason with another excuse. Out on your own, cut to the bone. Time after time. repeat * (2x). . (written and arranged by Nazareth). copyright 1983 Fool Circle Limited."
railroad boy,"Hear the whistle blowin' so long. Tellin' me I gotta move along. Coast to coast gonna steal highway. Railroad boy up in the guiding daybreak. Get no sleep in a boxcar. Get no piece of line. They catch you jumpin' a freight train. They give you such a hard time. Movin' fast as my time runs out. Coal is something I can live without. Railroad fever got me a route. Like tumblweed I ain't got no roots. You know no peace in a boxcar. Just can't sleep on a line. They catch you jumpin' a freight train. They give you such a hard time. (lead). East coast towns they are. Dark and cold. West coast ladies. They get right to my soul. But you know. Can't stand long. Bet all rairoader's. Are singin' my song. (Sweet, Charlton, Agnew, McCafferty).

rain on the window,Round about midnight. I feel the chill closinâ€™ in. Living my stage fright. I need the sun to begin - tomorrow. Thinking â€˜bout my life. And all the changes she made. And when she went running out. All the colors fade - to midnight. What a bad week Iâ€™ve had. Thereâ€™s rain on the window. What a bad week Iâ€™m sad. Thereâ€™s rain on my window. Will I be staying. Or am I moving in. Am I still standing. Iâ€™ve gotta wait - sheâ€™s choosing. * What a bad week Iâ€™ve had. Thereâ€™s rain on the window. What a bad week Iâ€™m sad. Thereâ€™s rain on the window.

red light lady,"(copyright Nazareth,Tiflis Tunes,inc.-ascap). Down at the house with the red light. She works from seven til dawn. You'll find her there any time that you like. Some days a week she'll be on. Down at the house with the red light. I was a boy not to sure of myself. When I was first taken down. Down to the house with the red light. Two miles west of town. I paid my fee and I went on in. Into the house with the red light. Pull up a chair, up the stairs. The key was cold and dampened my hand. Opened the door, heard her say;. ""Into my room and set yourself down"". She let us lie on this shiny brass bed. Curtains and flowers in her hair. She played my soul and she shattered my head. Could not believe I was there. Down at the house with the red light. I fell in love with that lady. First love I knew, she gave me. Seven days a week, you can find her. Down at the house with the red light"

road to nowhere,I tried to hang on for as long as I could. But now I can see that it just ainâ€™t no good. Our love it has wasted. Right down to the core. Whatever we had. We donâ€™t have anymore.

But I guess weâ€™re two people who canâ€™t help but fight. Your eyes they are open. And oh so are mine. We both need our freedom. Donâ€™t you think itâ€™s about time.

robber and the roadie,"When Willie met Ronnie he was runnin' up a track. He was bent down, burned out, carryin' a sack. Come on boy, you got to stop and help me some. And keep this money hidden when the police come. Ronnie was shiverin' and makin' funny sounds. He was lookin' like a fox. That was runnin' from the hounds. Sure little buddy, I can lighten up your load. You half it up, I'll hit it up, I'll take it down the road. Never had a better combination been planned. 'Cos Willie was a roadie with a rock æ†‚?roll band. They were heads back, celebratin', drinkin' moonshine. Heads down, here we go across another state line. Tanked up and bullet proof. They couldn't give a monkey's. Damn if he didn't hide the money in a drum case. Pack 'em up, hit em up, do another show. The robber and the roadie got a long way to go. Willie and Ronnie. Anytime they wanted they would pull another job. Anywhere they found a place. And it was fat enough to rob. If Ronnie saw the police he would make a little sign. Then Willie stuck the money in the band's back line. In the main racks, bass stacks. Anywhere he thought it could. Be hidden out of sight. Until the finished out in Hollywood. Split it down the middle. When they took it out the sound. The robber and the roadie got enough to go around. Willie and Ronnie. The robber and the roadie. Forty seven days and they had only one to go. When the telegram arived. To say the band wouldn't show. The crowd was getting' nasty and it turned into a rage. The bottles and the bodies started coverin' the stage. Then the cops came running in. And breaking up the riotin'. When they saw the money falling. Out the back of everything. Hey little buddy think it's time to run and duck. The robber and the roadie could be runnin' out of luck. Willie and Ronnie had to skip it out of town. They were sittin' by the highway like Jackson Browne. They were stickin' out their thumbs. In the middle of the night. When they saw the car comin' with the spinnin' red light. Wide eyed, tongue tied feelin' pretty stranded. No use in runnin' they were caught red handed. Pull 'em in, lock 'em up, put 'em in a row. The robber and the roadie got nowhere to go. Willie and Ronnie. The robber and the roadie. We got state police and the FBI. Willie and Ronnie. You get a big reward. If you can make these boy's mamas cry. The robber and the roadie. We got the national guard and the bear in the sky. Willie and Ronnie. You get a big reward if you can make these mothers cry."

rubik's romance,More complicated than a Rubik's. Won't size 'em cause it's always changing. We walked and talked around in circles. Wasting time I found the truth is undiscovered. The time we're falling like a spotlight. A play you sang in harmony. And the whispers after midnight. Making promises and breaking others. We hide behind our shields. We're hiding what we feel. How long can we go on pretending. Afraid we don't belong. And scared we might be wrong. This life's for giving not for lending. We share it with the understanding. I'll play the pipe and then you call the tune. Take our places with the dances. Moving round the tables one after the other. The moves we made were shadow-boxing. I brought the punches and you did the same. Baby better if we had a rumble. Than crawl into our corners as we recover. We hide behind our shields. We're hiding what we feel. How long can we go on pretending. Afraid we don't belong. And scared we might be wrong. This life's for giving not for lending. Let's take our guard down. Let's start taking chances. We're wasting time to come around. There'll be no guarantee of happy ever after. Stepping loud and feeling free. We'll write another chapter. [?]. Living a casino of the heart. Waiting for the moment. Never mind the ending. Playing safe but knowing that. It's hard to lose a race we didn't start
ruby tuesday,She would never say where she came from. And yesterday don't matter if it's gone. When the sun is bright. Or on the darkest night. No one knows.......she comes and goes. chorus:. Goodbye ruby tuesday. Who could hang a name on you. When you change with every new day. Still I'm gonna miss you. No question why she needs to be so free. She'll tell you it's the only way to be. She just can't be chained. To a life where nothing's gained. And nothing's lost.......at such a cost. chorus:. There's no time to lose I heard her say. Cast your dreams before they slip away. Tired all the time. Lose your dreams and you will lose your mind. Ain't life unkind. chorus: (4x). . (jagger/richards)

Flyin' across the desert from Texas to Tuscon. But we're headed for a southern star. The captain says it's fine in Havana. This dude behind me needs a cigar.. He's a big one, he's got a big gun. I guess we better go along. Mister we've got a gig in Arizona. Second billing to the rolling stones. Shanghai'd in Shanghai. Stood on in Tuscon. Ripped off and kicked right out the bed.

Engine take me through the night. Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby.. Twenty miles from that georgia state. I can hear the sirens wailing. If only I can cross that line. And leave the police trailing. I see a red light at my rear. Now I'm sweatin' cold steel fear. Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby.. I'm tired of all this running. Hiding from the light. I want to walk out in the sun. I'll soon be home I can see the clay. I'll soon be in Atlanta. If only I can hold that line. I can live just how I want to. I see the state line in my lights. Engine take me through the night. Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby..

Chorus:. You took the road to fortune and fame. Your name in lights. I want you to know I still feel the same. Star, I still love you. I still love you. Remembering when you played me that first song. The first show that you asked me along. Just to be around. Working so hard 'till you got that first break. You said you could turn them around. Give them something new. (Chorus:). Got that photograph of you and me. I hear your voice on the radio. Will I ever lay with you again. Nobody planned it, we just seem to drift now. I always seem to have to leave. Just as you come around. But someday soon girl I just got to see you. I just gotta find out. If we still have time. (Chorus:)"

With mass consultation, a blind congregation. His chapter, his verse, and his profit ocscene. Correspondence, the back of a sin rag. If this is deliverence, life is a drag. Searchin' salvation, your sightlines get hazy. You got it right,go crazy.. Talkin' to one of the boys. Talkin' to one of the boys. Makin' alot of noise. Talkin' to one of the boys. Talkin' to one of the boys. Makin' alot of noise. Talkin' to one of the boys. One of the boys told me what was,. Going on last night. One of the boys said if I tried it,.

teenage nervous breakdown,"(copyright lowell george,1971 naked snake music). . Well, some contend that this rock'n'roll. Is bad for the body, bad for the soul. Bad for the heart, bad for the mind. Bad for the deaf and bad for the blind. It makes some men crazy and then they talk like fools. It makes some men crazy and then they start to drool. Unscrupulous operators could confuse. Could exploit and deceive. The conditional reflex theories. Change the probabilities, I said it's a. Crass and raucous crackass place. With a Pavlov on the human race.

Get yourself an electric guitar. and take some time and learn to play.. Your roadies call to say OK. The soundcheck can get underway. Soundcheckover, had some fun. A waste of time for everyone.

For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife. . She walks these hills in a long black veil. She visits my grave when the night winds wail. Nobody knows, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me. Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near. She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear. But late at night, when the north wind blows. In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones.

this flight tonight,"Look out the left the captain said. The lights down there that's where we'll land. Saw a falling star burning. High above the Las Vegas sand.

Starbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I like. Turn this crazy bird around. Should not have got on this flight tonight. I'm drinkin' sweet champagne got the headphones up high. Can't numb you, can't drum you out of my mind. They're singin'-""Goodbye baby,. Baby bye-bye,. Ooh! love is blind"". Up go the flaps,down go the wheels. Hope you got your heat turned on baby. Hope they've finally fixed your automobile. Hope it's better when we meet again babe. Look out the left the captain said. The lights down there that's where we'll land. Saw a falling star burning. High above the Las Vegas sand. It wasn't the one that you gave to me. That night down south between the trailers. Not the early one that you wish upon. Not the northern one that guides in the sailors. You've got that touch so gentle and sweet. But you've got that look so critical. Can't talk to you babe you know I get so weak. Sometimes I think that love is just mythical. Up there's a heaven, down there's a town. Blackness everywhere any little lights shine. Blackness, blackness draggin' me down. Come on light a candle in this heart of mine. Starbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I like. Turn this crazy bird around. Should not have got on this flight tonight. I'm drinkin' sweet champagne got the headphones up high. Can't numb you, can't drum you out of my mind. They're singin'-""Goodbye baby,. Baby bye-bye,. Ooh! love is blind"". Up go the flaps,down go the wheels. Hope you got your heat turned on baby. Hope they've finally fixed your automobile. Hope it's better when we meet again babe."
this month's messiah,"I'm just a pilgrim here looking for holy ground. I'm just a body lost but my soul can be found. How many miles to go. How many miles to babylon. I don't know where to turn when answers all fade clear. But I must find a place there's only questions here. How many miles to go. How many miles to babylon. How many miles to go. How many miles to babylon. I feel...feel like I'm on trial. Who made a judge of you. Are you this month's messiah. I am a fightin' man tired of living under the gun. But am I looking for love or am I looking to run. How many miles to go. How many miles to babylon. How many miles to go. How many miles to babylon. I heard...i heard it on the wire. That it's all up to you. Are you this month's messiah. How many miles to go. How many miles to babylon. . (McCafferty, Agnew, Charlton, Sweet)"

trouble,A ship comes in from Africa. Carrying forbidden cargo. Gonna bring somebody lots a trouble. There’s a family out in Ohio. Gonna step on it and make it grow. Gonna foll some people at the double. Let it all go round. And it all comes down. A captain down in Florida. Knows a man back in Chicago. Every deal you know he’s makin money. Rico comes from Texas way. With a señorita from el paso. Glad he’s found the land of milk and honey. Let it all go round. And it comes down. 'G' man down in Panama. Cuts a trail to Barcelona. Dip-lo-matic-bag will be no hassle. Sails into the big T.O. Thru' the pipelineto Alaska. She's the one in town with something special. Maybe you maybe me maybe them. Look at you look at me look at them. Cut it out. You don't need it anyway. See its face in Tennessee. Knows a place in Casablanca. Detroit city never was a stranger. On the streets of Amsterdam. London town and all around us. Everywhere we look we see the danger. Let it all go around. And it all comes down

We talked through all kinds of weather. About giving our love a whirl. Do you remember at the high school dance. When the beach boys sang about good vibrations. My Victoria, Victoria, I could love you for a hundred years. And still want more of ya!. We walked to school together. Just a boy and a girl. We talked through all kinds of weather. About giving our love a whirl. We were cruisin' the strip every Friday night. Headin' for the beach in a two tone torc flight. First time I turned and saw you. God only knows I love you. Never anyone before you. Don't you know I still adore you. My Victoria, Victoria ...........chorus to fade. . (Sweet). (copyright 1980 Garthward limited)."

walk by yourself,"Walk by yourself, I've offered you my hand in friendship. You live alone; don't want to see in my house. You never contend, but you get your seat at ringside.

At the rendezvous, I was on my own. CHORUS:. Excuse me if I make you nervous. But I could never put my trust in a visionary. Phone's dead when you call room service.

winter sunlight,Winter sunlight. Dancing on the sea. By the shoreline. Is where you find us. This is our time. When the tide is in retreat. Winter sunlight. Is there to guide us. You and me. This could never be the same without you. Secret moments you and I will share. May serenity and love always surround you. Everywhere. Oh yes. Everywhere. Winter sunlight. Dancing on the sea. By the shore line. Is where you find us. This is our time. When the tide is in retreat. Winter sunlight. Is there to guide us. You and me. This could never be the same without you

I'm your witchdoctor woman. And i'm gonna put my spell on you. I'm your witchdoctor woman. Lord i got my mind on you. repeat 1. chorus. lead. repeat 2."
woke up this morning,Woke up this morning. My dog was dead. Someone disliked him. And shot him through the head. I woke up this morning. And my cat had died. I’m gonna miss her. Sat down and cried. Came home this evening. My hog was gone. The people here don’t like me. I think I’ll soon move on. And now somethin’s happened. That would make a saint frown. I turned my back and. My house burned down. Woke up this morning. My dog was dead. Someone disliked him. And shot him through the head. I woke up this morning. And my cat had died. Don’t you know I’m gonna miss her. Sat down and cried.

you call me,"You call me wasted. You call me a sad sack of bones. You call me anytime you want to. Even call me to tell me to thank you for calling. You call me reckless. You call me the emperor of moan. You call me anything you want to. And then you beg me not to leave you alone. Call me up when you see me right. Call me up when you see the light. Call me up, let me hear your cries. Call me back when you finally realise. We can't turn the clock back. But we can wind it up again. You call me impossible. You call me an acquaintance not your mate. Sometimes you really get mad and then you call me your favourite thing to hate. Wake me up in the middle of the night just to tell me you'll be late. You can't see what you're trying to hide. You can't lick your wounds cos they're deep inside. Can't talk sweet talk when you can't think straight. Hold that thought while you hesitate. Until it's dark enough for you to see the stars. Now you're out you can stay away. Call me up when you've got something nice to say. I'm kind of tired but I still can wait. Till you change how you operate. Don't hate till it's too late. With no time to heal the scars. You call me lonely. Picking roses on my own. You got me jumping and running and hiding at the sound of your cruel telephone. Then you howl when I don't pick it up, you're like a dog without a bone"
you don't believe in us,"I never asked you for money. I only needed some time. You took more than you gave and you sat on the line. I never asked you for nothing. I only looked for a chance. I only needed some help I never asked for this dance. Now youâ€™re holding the aces. The world is under your feet. Thereâ€™ll come a day when you smile and you wonâ€™t look so sweet. You never gave me no favors. I never owed you a thing. Youâ€™ll never know why you dream what tomorrow will bring. You donâ€™t believe in us...you donâ€™t believe in us. You only wanted our mind. You donâ€™t believe in us...you donâ€™t believe in us. Youâ€™re only payinâ€™ our time. You never gave me no answers. You never showed me no clues. The day will come when Iâ€™ll watch you take a walk in my shoes. You never saw when I caught it. You never opened your eyes. Youâ€™ll never see where you stand when your headâ€™s in the skies. (chorus). . (McCafferty, Agnew, Charlton, Sweet)."
you had it comin',"Someone givin' you a hard time. You got on the attack. But some never had a chance in hell. Cos you were on their back. The news spread like a holiday. æ??out your æ³ccident?No roses, no wish you wells. That ainæ?° money well spent. I wanna know what you were thinkin. As your walls came down. Surprised eyes of your sacrifice. Or just that youæ?? been found. If they done to you what you could do. Youæ?? be torn apart. You havenæ?° suffered quite enough boy. But itæ?¯ a start. You had it comin? comin?to you. You had it comin? really had it comin?to you. My, my, funny time don't fly. When you got you to yourself. And your disease makes you ill at ease. Bad for your health. Then all these questions with your patient replies. Not foolin' anyone. If not for you only strong survive, if they run. You had it comin' comin' to you. You had it comin' really had it comin' to you. Someone givin' you a hard time. You go on the attack. Some never had a chance in hell. Cos you were on their back. If they done to you what you could do. You're be torn apart. You havenæ?° suffered quite enough boy. But it's a start. You had it comin' comin' to you. You had it comin' really had it comin' to you.

you love another,"Don't wanna live she said. No more to give she said. I can't forgive she said. You love another, you love another. Can't live alone she said. Left off the phone she said. Can't face the storm she said. You love another, you love another. Don't make me cry she said. Just let me die she said. Kiss me goodbye she said. You love another, you love another. Don't take the blame she said. And I can go insane she said. Never the same she said. You love another, you love another. You love another, you love another. You love aother--my heart is tearing. You love another. You love another--no longer caring. You love another. You love another--my heart is tearing. You love another--no longer caring. You love another. .

you're the violin,"YOUâ€™RE THE VIOLIN. Nazareth. Some beat me like a drum. Some stroke me like a guitar. Some shake me like a tambourine. Some beat me into the wall. In the song of my life. Baby, youâ€™re the violin. Some blow me like a horn. Some slide me like a trombone. Some smoke me like a tuba dude. Some cut me like a saxophone. In the song of my life. Baby, youâ€™re the violin. When you touch me like you touch me. Donâ€™t it feel like a summer breeze. When you lay down in my lonely soul, ya. It brings me to my knees. Think Iâ€™m makinâ€™ love to you. Sweet Baby, Ya. When you touch me like you touch me. Well, donâ€™t it feel like a summer breeze. When you lay down in my lonely soul, ya. It brings me to my knees. Think Iâ€™m makinâ€™ love to you. Sweet Baby, Ya. Some beat me like a drum. Some stroke me like a guitar. Sh-sh-sh-shake me like a tambourine. Some beat me into the wall. In the song of my life. Baby, youâ€™re the violin. In the song of my life. Baby, youâ€™re the violin. (WORDS AND MUSIC BY NAZARETH)."
