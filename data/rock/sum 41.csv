with me,"I don't want this moment, to ever end,. Where everything's nothing, without you.. I'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile,. Cause it's true, I am nothing without you.. Through it all, I made my mistakes.. I stumble and fall,. But I mean these words.. I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go.. These words are my heart and soul,. I hold on to this moment you know.. Cause I'd bleed my heart out to show, that I won't let go.. Thoughts read unspoken, forever in doubt.. And pieces of memories fall to the ground.. I know what i didn't have so, I won't let this go.. Cause it's true, I am nothing without you.. All the streets, where I walked alone,. With nowhere to go.. Have come to an end.. I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go.. These words are my heart and soul,. I hold on to this moment you know.. Cause I'd bleed my heart out to show, that I won't let go.. In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies,. When you don't know what you're looking to find.. In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies,. When you just never know what you will find.. I don't want this moment to ever end.. Where everything's nothing without you.. I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go.. These words are my heart and soul,. I hold on to this moment you know.. Cause I'd bleed my heart out to show, that I won't let go."
fat lip,"Storming through the party like my name was El Ni√±o. When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino. As a kid, I was a skid and no one knew me by. name.. I trashed my own house party cause nobody came.. I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school. Never going, ever showing up when we had to.. Is it attention that we crave don't tell us to behave,. I'm sick of always hearing act your age.. I don't wanna waste my time. Become another casualty of society.. I'll never fall in line. Become another victim of your conformity. And back down.. Because you don't. Know us at all we laugh when old people fall.. But what would you expect with a conscience so small.. Heavy metal and mullets it's how we were raised.. Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised. Cause we like having fun at other peoples expense and,. Cutting people down is just a minor offence then,. It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn.. I'm sick of being told to wait my turn.. I don't wanna waste my time. And become another casualty of society.. I'll never fall in line. Become another victim of your conformity. And back down.. Don't count on me, to let you know when.. Don't count on me, I'll do it again.. Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing.. Don't count on me, cause I'm not listening.. Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat,. Back packed and I don't give a shit about nothing.. You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin.. But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing.. Then if the egg don't stain you'll be ringing off the hook,. You're on the hit list wanted in the telephone book.. I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion.. The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion.. I don't wanna waste my time. Become another casualty of society.. I'll never fall in line. Become another victim of your conformity. And back down.. Waste my time with them. Casualty of society.. Waste my time again,. Victim of your conformity. And back down."
pieces,I tried to be perfect. But nothing was worth it. I don't believe it makes me real. I thought it'd be easy. But no one believes me. I meant all the things I said. If you believe it's in my soul. I'd say all the words that I know. Just to see if it would show. That I'm trying to let you know. That I'm better off on my own. This place is so empty. My thoughts are so tempting. I don't know how it got so bad. Sometimes it's so crazy. That nothing can save me. But it's the only thing that I have. If you believe it's in my soul. I'd say all the words that I know. Just to see if it would show. That I'm trying to let you know. That I'm better off on my own. On my own. I tried to be perfect. It just wasn't worth it. Nothing could ever be so wrong. It's hard to believe me. It never gets easy. I guess I knew that all along. If you believe it's in my soul. I'd say all the words that I know. Just to see if it would show. That I'm trying to let you know. That I'm better off on my own
walking disaster,"I haven't been home for a while. I'm sure everything's the same. Mom and Dad both in denial. An only child to take the blame. Sorry, Mom, but I don't miss you. Father's no name you deserve. I'm just a kid with no ambitions. Wouldn't come home for the world. Never know what I've become. The king of all that's said and done. The forgotten son. This city's buried in defeat. I walk along these no-name streets. Wave goodbye to home. As I fall.... At the dead-end I begin. To burn a bridge of innocence. Satisfaction guaranteed. A pillow-weight catastrophe. Our own mission nowhere bound. Inhibitions underground. A shallow grave I. Have dug all by myself. And now I've been gone for so long. I can't remember who was wrong. All innocence is long gone. I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief. Where I belong. A walking disaster. The son of all bastards. You regret you made me. It's too late to save me. (You regret you made me. It's too late to save me). As far as I can tell. It's just voices in my head. Am I talking to myself?. 'Cause I don't know what I just said. (And she said). As far as where I fell. Maybe I'm better off dead. Am I at the end of nowhere. Is this as good as it gets?. And now I've been gone for so long. I can't remember who was wrong. All innocence is long gone. I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief. Where I belong. A walking disaster. The son of all bastards. You regret you made me. It's too late to save me. (To save me, to save me, to save me, [etc.]). [""It's too late"" x2 & other vocalizing]. To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me. And now I've been gone for so long. I can't remember who was wrong. All innocence is long gone. I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief. Where I belong. A walking disaster. The son of all bastards. You regret you made me. It's too late to save me. I will be home in a while. You don't have to say a word. I can't wait to see you smile. Wouldn't miss it for the world [2x]"
in too deep,"Faster we're falling. We're stopping and stalling. We're running in circles again. Just as things were looking up. You said it wasn't good enough. But still we're trying one more time. Maybe we're just trying too hard. When really it's closer then it is too far. Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep. Up above in my head, instead of going under. Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep. Up above in my head, instead of going under. Instead of going under. Seems like each time. I'm with you I lose my mind. Because I'm bending over backwards to relate. It's one thing to complain. But when you're driving me insane. Well then I think it's time that we took a break. Maybe we're just trying to hard. When really it's closer than it is too far. Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep. Up above in my head, instead of going under. Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep. Up above in my head, instead of going under. Instead of going under. Instead of going under. I can't sit back and wonder why. It took so long for this to die. And I hate it when you fake it. You can't hide it you might as well embrace it. So believe me it's not easy. It seems that something's telling me. Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep. Up above in my head, instead of going under. Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep. Up above in my head, instead of going under. Instead of going under. instead of going under. Instead of going under again. Instead of going under. Instead of going under again. Instead of going under again"
still waiting,"[Chorus:]. So am I still waiting. For this world to stop hating. Can't find a good reason. Can't find hope to believe in. Drop dead. A bullet to my head. Your words are like a gun in hand. You can't change the state of the nation. We just need some motivation. These eyes. Have seen no conviction. Just lies and more contradiction. So tell me what would you say. I'd say it's up to me.... [Chorus:]. So am I still waiting. For this world to stop hating. Can't find a good reason. Can't find hope to believe in. Ignorance. And understanding. We're the first ones to jump in line. Out of step for what we believe in. But who's left to stop the bleeding. How far. Will we take this. It's not hard to see through the fakeness. So tell me what would you say. I'd say it's up. To me.... [Chorus:]. So am I still waiting. For this world to stop hating. Can't find a good reason. Can't find hope to believe. This can't last forever. Time won't make things better. I feel so alone. Can't help myself. And no one knows. If this is worthless, tell me. So. What have we done. this is a war that can't be won. This can't be real. Cause I don't know what to feel now. [Chorus:]. So am I still waiting. For this world to stop hating. Can't find a good reason. Can't find hope to believe. So am I still waiting. For this world to stop hating. Can't find a good reason. For this world to BELIEVE"

what we're all about,"Nevertheless am I dressed for the occasion. It`s number 32 now here`s the situation. If the beat moves your feet then don`t change the. station. Pack your bags cause we`re leaving on a permanent. vacation. Well, I`m a disaster. A microphone master. Put on your tape and rock your ghetto blaster. It`s not about the money, cars, hotels, or resorts. About sweating all the bitches in the biker shorts. I`m Dave Brown Sound and you see me running late. Cause I`m always making time to make your girlie feel great. And I`m Bizzy D from way down town. I`m known to rock a mic like a king was a crown. When I`m on top I`m gonna borrow that bootie. Hustling deals like Mickey Macoote. When I wake up I like a pound of bacon. Start off the day with my arteries shaking. (Chorus x4). Rock! It's what we're all about. It's what we live for. C'mon shout it out. Well I bring down the house in every city we play. Just from pickin' up the mic' in a usual way. We rock and talk with a bass that's funny. We could even tear it up at a grade school party. Well I can keep the beat but I can't break dis. It's hard to look cool in crazy pants. But I wear 'em anyway even when they look whack. It's my personal way to bring the 80's back. Gave up the life of servin' burger and fries. High cholesterol gettin' grease in my eyes. I was drinkin' underage I belong on stage. Hello rock 'n' roll goodbye minimum wage. I'm teachin' you a lesson in mic' control. Makin' rhymes with my letters in my cereal bowl. Lucky number seven every dice I roll. Sum 41 to the power as the poon patrol. (Chorus x4). Well it's a... I'm makin' one thing clear. The rock we're bringin' is gonna instill fear. and the power we control should be revered. We sold our soul to Satan two times last year. Take a look to the point, to the point I'm makin'. We rock the oven when we`re stone cold bakin`. And we get outta hand and bust up the room. JD is to blame for the Legion of Doom. 'Cause I'm the B-I double Z-Y. You ain't better than me, I ain't your average guy. I like to watch girls shake with a kung fu grip. Well the goon platoon is on the prankster tip. We beat down London, we slayed LA. Got an APB on the jams we play. So when you're on the stage cold grabbin' your cock. Pledge allegiance to sum the new kings of rock. (Chorus)"

all messed up,Another day wasted out of time. I can't get out of this. Altered state of mind. I'm going overboard. My conscience meets decline. Into reality. I know this can't be fine. (Chorus). Cause I'm all messed up. Making perfect nonsense. Drowning in my doubt. To hell. Cause I'm all messed up. Going nowhere fast. But circles in my mind. So blind. Who are these voices in my head. I can't go on like this. Living like the dead. I havent slept so long. Feeling sad I dread. I'm talking to myself. Forgot what I just said. (Chorus). Well I hold my only enemy. As closely as a friend. And I sold my own reality. To further my decent. Self destruction taking over. It's so easy to pretend. Introduction to this nightmare. That now seems may never end. Can anyone help me drag my heels. I'm running overtime. I can't hold down my meals. My mind is racing by. Staring blankly feels. Like pulling out my teeth. While this engine whines. (Chorus)

Remember just to live every day like it's your last,. And hold me now, 'cause I think it's time for me to pass.. I don't want to die, I don't know why, this kind of fate was meant for me.. You got to be strong, got to move on, it's not how it was 'sposed to be.. And what do I say, it was never supposed to end up this way,. What do I have to do, was I supposed to grow old with you?. But that ain't gonna happen,. No, that ain't gonna happen.. Hold me now, 'cause the time I've got's running out,. No tears allowed, even though we've become without,. I just want to feel your head laying on my chest,. So hold me now, as I take my last breath.. I don't want to die, I don't know why, this kind of fate was meant for me..

crazy amanda bunkface,"Don't know what you've really got. It's hard to stay and not pretend. You can't make sense in what you've thought. It seems I can't comprehend. I'm happy to be, only all that you see. And I'm not one to learn to be the same. I don't wanna hear you bitch no more. I was better off a year before. No matter how I try I can't ignore. But every time I think my brain gets sore. When I'm with you. What's so hard about good-byes?. I'm sorry I'm just not as keen. On planning out our perfect lives. When I'm only nineteen. Cause I'm happy to be only all that you see. And I'm not one to learn to be the same. I don't wanna try and just be friends. Nothing's changed my mind again. If ever there were thoughts I had they're dead. I can't even think inside my head. When I'm with you. I'm on my way, can't you see that's the truth?. So long, can't stay, wont you see that's the truth?. I'm on my way, can't you see that's the truth?. So long, can't stay, wont you see that's. See that's the, see that's the, see that's the.... Last that I can take. Because it's getting really hard to fake. It's not like it's my problem that you're late. Why can't you spare the lies I hate?. When I'm with you"
dave's possessed hair/it's what we're all about,"Ever get the feeling no one's got your back. Caught up in themselves livin' lies besides the fact. Somehow you're going on an opposite track. As we recover from another social heart attack. You think you see between the lines. But you can't see through dollar signs. So sick and tasteless now. Immature and faceless how. Can I even sleep at night you ask. You say you're a pacifist. Instead you wave your fist. And all the while it becomes the end again. Make up your mind cause I can't decide. You think uniqueulism makes you dignified. You can't see with half opened eyes. You think you're standing up instead you're falling far behind. What I do is what I choose which makes it my decision. If your life was a book your story would be fiction. Nevertheless am I dressed for the occasion. It's number 32 now here's the situation. If the beat moves your feet then don't change the station. Pack your bags cause we're leaving on a permanent vacation. Well, I'm a disaster. A microphone master. Put on the tape, I'll rock your ghetto blaster. It's not about the money, cars, hotels, or resorts. About sweating all the bitches in the biker shorts. I'm Hot Chocolate and you'll see me running late. Cause I'm always making time to make your girlie feel great. And I'm Bizzy D from way down town. I'm known to rock a mic like a king with a crown. When I'm on top I'm gonna borrow that bootie. Hustling deals like Micky Macoote. When I wake up I like a pound of bacon. Start off the day with my arteries shaking. ROCK!. It's what we're all about it's what we live for. C'mon and shout it out [x4]. You see me in 3D, I'm comin' live and direct. With a dialect most men in science can't disect. Thoughts interwoven, and let us interlock. So now it's my thing to blow off steam and get my cream. Sum 41 get wild, I get frantic. And every time we spit it the world panicks. I maybe lost my mind well I ain't through the coop. But Sum 41 just ain't about a loop. Ring a ling a ling ding dong tick tock, shit, it's all about rap. And maybe all about rock!. . by Ana ;**"

march of the dogs,"Ladies and gentlemen of the underclass. The president of the United States of America. Is dead!. I don't believe in the politics. Of chosen fools and hypocrites. Who walk a line that's stretched so fine. Is death or glory had in mind. And here we go again it's mass delusion. And no one knows who leads this revolution now. As tension grows the way to a conclusion. It's too late, there's no time. (It's too late, there's no time). All for none, none for one, two, three, four. March of the dogs to a beat of disillusion. Sworn under god, breeding panic and confusion. The white flag is down, send it to the clowns. The carnival of sins is now about to begin. It may be I'm a pessimist. But I'd say we need an exorcist. The root of all evil standing tall. Under God and above us all. And here we go again in desperation. All we know is confusion and frustration now. As tension grows no vision of salvation. It's too late, there's no time. (It's too late, there's no time). All for none, none for one, two, three, four. And now the president's dead. Because they blew off his head. No more neck to be red. Guess to heaven he fled. Was it something he said. Or because of who's in his bed?. By whom will we be led?. From whose hand will we be fed?. All the lies by the lying liars who said. ""We'll be fine"". It's Ok. Hey, look mom, no head!"

How long can I keep this up. Before I end up dead!?. I can't believe that it could come to this. It's only feelings though I can't resist. I'm falling deeper in denial but I still try to. Believe in something. You can fake this and. I can't take anymore. I'm not so tough. I can't ignore... You can fake this and. I can't take anymore. I'm not so tough. I can't ignore.. anymore!.

Pretty girls are everywhere, look for me and I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time. Good bye my pop, please pray for me. I was the black sheep of the family. You tried to teach me right from wrong. Too much wine, too much song don't know how i got along. Good bye, good bye it's hard to die. When all the birds are singing in the sky. Now that spring is in the air. Little children everywhere. When you see them I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. But the wine and the song of all the seasons are now gone (x2). Good bye Rochel my little one. You gave me love and helped me find the sun. And everytime that I was down. You would always come around. And get my feet back on the ground. Good bye Rachel it's hard to die. When all the birds are singing in the sky. Now that spring is in the air. There are flowers everywhere. I wish when you pick them I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. But the stars and their reason, and describes all their meaning(x2). We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. But the wine and the song of all the seasons are now gone. Now all our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. But the hills that we climb were just seasons out of time"

welcome to hell,Don't come to me with your problems I don't need them. Your conscience is a weight that I won't hold. You'd rather be the only who pretends. Is it cause you've been bought and sold so young. Don't ask me questions cause I don't got the answers. If you only knew what time will tell. It's all a test and lessons that you can't learn. You'll know when you spend your time in hell. As your blood's running thin your time's running out. No one will be listening not even when you shout. When your angels turn to devils you'll finally figure out. That no one will be with you in the end. A hypocrite you're just a contradiction. Rapped up in your lies who knows what's real. Well this is it your lonely life of fiction. Do you even know how to feel. As your blood's running thin your time's running out. No one will be listening not even when you shout. When your angels turn to devils you'll finally figure out. That no one will be with you in the end. The end. The end. The end

what i believe,lies and deceiving is what i'm believing. up to my knees so hard to breathe. it helps that you aren't there. can't figure out what's the right thing for me. guess i'll have to wait and see. so understanding but so far from the truth. it's what i have to live with. it's not all i wanted to be. it's not all i wanted to see. i can't keep on leading. i've left what i'm leaving. guess that's just what i believe. consciously taking and overly faking. i can't believe all the things that you're saying. seems all so simple it's all up to you. time after time. you lost what you couldn't find. it's what you could (what you could). it's only what you could (its what you could). don't take what you could. but i know what's up. so understanding but so far from the truth. it's what i have to live with. it's not all i wanted to be. it's not all i wanted to see. i can't keep on leading. i've left what i'm leaving. guess that's just what i believe.
what we're all about,"Nevertheless am I dressed for the occasion. It`s number 32 now here`s the situation. If the beat moves your feet then don`t change the. station. Pack your bags cause we`re leaving on a permanent. vacation. Well, I`m a disaster. A microphone master. Put on your tape and rock your ghetto blaster. It`s not about the money, cars, hotels, or resorts. About sweating all the bitches in the biker shorts. I`m Dave Brown Sound and you see me running late. Cause I`m always making time to make your girlie feel great. And I`m Bizzy D from way down town. I`m known to rock a mic like a king was a crown. When I`m on top I`m gonna borrow that bootie. Hustling deals like Mickey Macoote. When I wake up I like a pound of bacon. Start off the day with my arteries shaking. (Chorus x4). Rock! It's what we're all about. It's what we live for. C'mon shout it out. Well I bring down the house in every city we play. Just from pickin' up the mic' in a usual way. We rock and talk with a bass that's funny. We could even tear it up at a grade school party. Well I can keep the beat but I can't break dis. It's hard to look cool in crazy pants. But I wear 'em anyway even when they look whack. It's my personal way to bring the 80's back. Gave up the life of servin' burger and fries. High cholesterol gettin' grease in my eyes. I was drinkin' underage I belong on stage. Hello rock 'n' roll goodbye minimum wage. I'm teachin' you a lesson in mic' control. Makin' rhymes with my letters in my cereal bowl. Lucky number seven every dice I roll. Sum 41 to the power as the poon patrol. (Chorus x4). Well it's a... I'm makin' one thing clear. The rock we're bringin' is gonna instill fear. and the power we control should be revered. We sold our soul to Satan two times last year. Take a look to the point, to the point I'm makin'. We rock the oven when we`re stone cold bakin`. And we get outta hand and bust up the room. JD is to blame for the Legion of Doom. 'Cause I'm the B-I double Z-Y. You ain't better than me, I ain't your average guy. I like to watch girls shake with a kung fu grip. Well the goon platoon is on the prankster tip. We beat down London, we slayed LA. Got an APB on the jams we play. So when you're on the stage cold grabbin' your cock. Pledge allegiance to sum the new kings of rock. (Chorus)"
with me,"I don't want this moment, to ever end,. Where everything's nothing, without you.. I'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile,. Cause it's true, I am nothing without you.. Through it all, I made my mistakes.. I stumble and fall,. But I mean these words.. I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go.. These words are my heart and soul,. I hold on to this moment you know.. Cause I'd bleed my heart out to show, that I won't let go.. Thoughts read unspoken, forever in doubt.. And pieces of memories fall to the ground.. I know what i didn't have so, I won't let this go.. Cause it's true, I am nothing without you.. All the streets, where I walked alone,. With nowhere to go.. Have come to an end.. I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go.. These words are my heart and soul,. I hold on to this moment you know.. Cause I'd bleed my heart out to show, that I won't let go.. In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies,. When you don't know what you're looking to find.. In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies,. When you just never know what you will find.. I don't want this moment to ever end.. Where everything's nothing without you.. I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go.. These words are my heart and soul,. I hold on to this moment you know.. Cause I'd bleed my heart out to show, that I won't let go."
wwvii part 1 & 2,"The year is 3468. And they're about to eliminate. Life as we all know it on Planet Earth. They're products of a new regime. With manufactured designer genes.

Cerebroids are silencing their cries. The clones are trying to assist evolution. Through state sponsored executions. Will nothing stop this evil enterprise?. Until the day a leader emerges. With mind powers like electric surges. He'll give us hope, he'll teach us how to fight. A clash of arms with the enemy. An outcome no-one can forsee. Let's pray they can't withstand our human might. Have we created, our own demise. They're out to kill using their minds. You'll feel the chill run down your spine. Tell me, since when has being human been a crime?.
