better,"So blinded by my own desire. I blew out our loves first fire. A part of my life has been wasted. By choosing to live recklessly. How did it come to this!. But still your arms are wide open for me. You know I feel dirty. But you've filled your heart with my needs. My life is so broken. But you long to put me back together. How did it come to this!. I can't stand living without you near. Better is one day in your courts. Than a thousand elsewhere. I cry out for help 'cos. I lack the strength, purpose to live. From all of the choices I'll take the only one. That can change me deep within. How did it come to this!. Only you can help me, you alone. Better is one day in your courts. Than a thousand elsewhere. I was enslaved by my heart. Then you broke the chains. And freed me from all my pride. And now I'd rather live at your door. Than starve in the rotten wealth of this earth"

Let my light shine, my ways be your ways this time. I will always be here for you, waiting for you. I will not let go, cause I want to show, your heart is mine. How long will it take?. The cross, the proof I gave. I paid the price for you. Receive me, a-mazing love you take"
