battlefield,"It can not be seen. But there's blood on the green. Only God knows I'm innocent. Take me, take me home. A dark seed reigns in me. Like the storm rules over the sea. I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone. Don't dare me now. The threatening shadows will pass by. They're getting closer now. Open your eyes. Wake up my dear young friend. And hate shall fade away. I will not move, yet. I'll stand still, instead. There on the battlefield he stands. Down on the battlefield he's lost. And on the battlefield it ends. War and anger shall reign. The clash of iron can be heard. By blindness you're driven insane. I'm lost in anguish and grief. Sorrow won't wane 'til you die. A shattered body deeply hurt. And darkness will cover the light. It's gone forever more. The field's been left in sorrow. The father and the son. They're gone. The sun shines bright. And anger rises. Lorn and lonely. Torn apart. Don't you think. It's time to stop now. We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss. Let's pray. That heaven is on our side. Through violence and horror. Shall honour arise. So let's pray. And blessed shall be our leader. We follow the noble and bright. Don't you hear me cryin'. Cryin'. Come take me away. I hallow thy name. There on the battlefield he stands. Down on the battlefield he's lost. And on the battlefield it ends. War and anger shall reign. The clash of iron can be heard. By blindness you're driven insane. I'm lost in anguish and grief. Sorrow won't wane 'til you die. A shattered body deeply hurt. And darkness will cover the light. It's gone forever more. That's what minstrel sing. Join in the horrible screams. Take part in murderous deeds. Renowned be the lion-hearted. Join in the minstrelsy. Wailing in endless grief. It eagerly longs for more. Broken bodies lay down on the ground. Blood sheds all over the place. The green will be stained forever. And hate reigns all over the field. They keep struggling on in anger. Fiercely intense. Outrageous, too blind to see. And in pain they keep on singing. We claim the land for the highlord. God bless the land and our highlord. War and anger shall reign. The clash of iron can be heard. By blindness you're driven insane. I'm lost in anguish and grief. Sorrow won't wane 'til you die. A shattered body deeply hurt. And darkness will cover the light. It's gone forever more"

can't stop messin',"Sitting at a stop sign. Lookin' for a friend of mine. Waiting to salute the flag. Talkin' to some he/she. Slidin' over next to me. Man, she said, this life is a drag. It's a shaky situation. I'm hangin' on my will. And I get no satisfaction. From a hundred dollar bill. But I got what I came for. And I'll do it 'till I drop. You do what you want to do. I ain't never gonna stop. (Chorus). You say you got something that makes you feel good. And you can't stop messin' with it. All your life you've been so misunderstood. 'Cause you can't stop messin'with it.. Sittin' by the seashore. Dreamin' 'bout a little more. Circlin' the classifieds. 976. Man I need another fix. I'll never have to kiss the bride. Yeah, the city is a war zone. This country gone to hell. And the beer cans in the alley. From the rich folks on the hill. They're screamin' hallellujah. But I don't givea damn. 'Cause I got my own religion. Yeah, it's a right here in my hand. (chorus)"

closer,"How many times can you turn away. You fall in love and then love falls away. You turn out the love when you turn out the lights. You hit the heavens when you hit the heights. How can I turn off the flame you know how it kills me. Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer. It's a give and take every time we break, I get closer. You get closer too. I love you baby till death due us part. If love's on a man why not un-break my heart. You start so many things so why not let's dance. 2 times in love or a one time romance. How can I turn off the flame you know how it kills me. Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer. It's a give and take every time we break, I get closer. You get closer too. And I don't know why we fight. What's wrong with always being right. It's always those damnedest things,. Can angels fly on broken wings. And every night when I'm alone in bed. I still smell your perfume. Then I wake up and I swear, I swear. I still remember. Every time you say love is gone away, I get closer. It's a give and take every time we break, I get closer.

"don't get mad, get even","I'll tell you little secret make you want to jump and shout. When you talk to me in circles take your foot out of your mouth.

Honey, don't get mad, get even. Don't get mad, get even. Don't get mad, get even. Don't get mad, get even. Say the times they be a changin' though the blind lead the blind.

You wonder why your girlfriend has her skirt hiked up to here. Honey, don't get mad, get even. Don't get mad, get even. Don't get mad, get even. Don't get mad, get even. Roll the dice get lucky 'cause they roll you for the dime. You got nothin' else to lose if you only lose your mind. When pleasure that is shallow causes trouble to be deep. You've been dusted with the devil while he sweeps you off your feet. Tell you little secret make you want to jump and shout. When you talk to me in circles take your foot out of your mouth.

You ain't got nothing on me. Some say they do. Some say they don't. I take it in stride. And I can never get enough. If I don't got to swallow my pride. I heard it all before and then. She told me ""gimme some slack"". Then she smiled at me and gave me. The shirt right off her back. And that's when I took advantage of the situation. (Chorus). Don't stop. Rockin' your socks off. Don't stop. Knockin' their blocks off. Don't stop. Gettin' your rocks off. Don't stop. Takin' a hit, boy. Don't stop. Shakin' your fist, boy. Don't stop. I ain't got much to lose. I'm feelin' so confused. There's such a small thin line. Between pleasure and pain. And when you say don't. Then it's don't stop. I got to complain. Yeah, I think I may be getting. Real tired of all the steam. Because it's hard to get the way. You move out of my dreams. Got to get it while you can. Whenever you're in doubt. You got to whip it out. When you keep hearin' no. And your body says yes. But you can't hear a word. That's been said. But you gotta confess. Looking up her address. Got you thinkin' with your other head."

Eat the Rich: there's only one thing that they're good for. Eat the Rich: take one bite now - come back for more. Eat the Rich: I gotta get this off my chest.

And a don't go burst a bubble. On rich folk who get rude. 'Cause you won't get in no trouble. When you eats that kind of food. Now they're smoking up their junk bonds. And then they go get stiff. And they're dancing at the yacht club. With Muff and Uncle Biff. But there's one good thing that happens. When you toss your pearls to swine. Their attitudes may taste like shit. But go real good with wine. (Chorus). Believe in all the good things. That money just can't buy. Then you won't get no bellyache. From eatin' humble pie. I believe in rags to riches. Your inheritance won't last. So take your Grey Poupon my friend. And shove it up your ass!. (Chorus:). Eat the Rich: there's only one thing that they're good for.

Turned to page six. She was in her birthday suit. Behind a crucifix. Ohhh must be Lizard Love. She was hangin' big booty. She was puss n' boots way up to here. She's a little bit of heaven, a 24-7. A 10 every day of the year. Now there must be some mistake. I'm feelin' so high strung. She said 'I make love like a snake. I even got a forked tongue'. At first I thought I was dreamin'. That I'd wake up and she'd dissappear. But when I opened up my eyes. She was laughing and a screamin' swinging from the chandlier. You know I never seem to give. Or ever get enough. And I just can't seem to live without. That sweet bodacious stuff."

melt down,"The streets were cold and barren. The nights were dark and dank. And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years..... The buildings were dead and the alleys. Stunk from things that used to live there. Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered. A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his. Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence. With not a scrap left on the plate. And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable. Cause the only thing left was their faith. And there sure as hell ain't much I can do. About it..... There's a Meltdown in the sky. There's a new day comin' and I don't know why. There's a fear that gets me high. And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by..... So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold. Made me wonder just who was the foe. And was it all to come true what Nostradamus. Had predicted such a long long time ago?. You could hear screams and moanin'. From the people atoning. For their sins of a guilt ridden life. And the final door shuts. From the wind that leaves cuts. From the edge on the blade of God's knife. And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about..... There's a Melt Down in the Sky. There's a new day comin and I don't know why. There's a tear stuck in my eye. There's a new day comin' and I don't know why. Battle lines had been drawn. Mother nature how she cried. By her side, till the dawn. Couldn't kill her if they tried. How they tried, open eyed, genocide. Then... she died. Battle lines had been drawn. Mother nature how she cried. By her side, till the dawn. Couldn't kill her if they tried. How they tried, open eyed, genocide. Then... she died. There's a Meltdown in the sky. There's a new day comin' and I don't know why. There's a fear that gets me high."

monkey on my back,"Wow is me. Well I've been dyin'. Got to get that monkey on my back. The fortune teller looked into my eyeballs. The wrinkles on her face about to crack. She said you best believe it. You ain't goio' nowhere. Unless you get that monkey off your back. Well I made believe the devil made me do it. I was the evil leader of the pack. You best believe I had it all and then I blew it. Feedin' that fuckin' monkey on my back. Ahh, if you put it in a spoon man I would boot it. Some kings whose mental house was just a shack. Where do you draw the line. When all your friends are dyin'. Got to get that monkey off your back. Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon. She said now bring me home his head inside a sack. But now you find your crystal ball are draggin'. Got to get that monkey off your back"

no more no more,"Blood stains the ivories. Of my daddy's baby grand. I aint' seen the daylight. Since we started this band. No More, No More. No More, No More. Store bought clothes.

But to me they're all the same. No More, No More. No More, No More. Baby I'm a dreamer. Found my horse and carriage. Stalemate jailbate. Ladies can't refuse. You love 'em then you leave 'em. With your sold out reviews. No More, No More. No More, No More. Sweet talkin' barroom, ladies disease. Slippin' with her lips. Slidin' down your knees. No More, No More. No More, No Me and my life a screamer. Bound to a wife in marriage. Baby, I'm a dreamer. Found my horse and carriage. Ladies hold the acess. And their lovers call it passion. The men call it pleasure. But to me it's old fashioned. Times they are a-changin. Nothin' ever stands still. If I don't start a-changin. I'll be writin' my will. It's the same old story. Never get a second chance. For a dance to the top of the heap. Baby I'm a dreamer. Found my horse and carriage"
no surprize,"1971, we all heard the starter gun. New York is such a pity. But at Max's Kansas City we won. We all shot shit in the bar. With Johnny O' Toole and his scar. And then old Clive Davis said. He's surely gonna make us a star. I'm gonna make you a star. Just the way you are. But with all his style. I could see in his eyes. That we is goin' on trial. and It was no surprise. The boys kept kickin' ass. As usual time would tell. But some bitch in the choir. Threw water on the fires of hell. She loved to shove and tell. Lord, she loved to tell. But with all our style. You could see in our eyes. That we is still on trial. And it was no surprise. No surprise. No surprise. No surprise. Midnight lady. Situation fetal. vaccinate yo ass with yo phonograph needle. I say look it here. A friend of mine. Scratch like you need calomine. Flamingo boots, soles a creakin'. Still in love and Puerto Rican too. Ridin' on the wheels of hell. Smokin' in our axle grease. The backstage is rockin'. And we're copping from the local polica. That's right, the local police. Or the juctice of peace. But with all our style. You could see in our eyes. That we is still on trial. Baby, it's no surprise. No surprise. No surprise. No surprise. Rock n' roll, junkie whore. Got my foot inside the door. Knock knock, knock knock, knock. Nobody's keepin' score. Bad time go away. Come again some other day. Topaz and sazzafraz. Will keep the blues away. Candy store, rock n' roll. Corporation jelly roll. Play the singles, it ain't me. It's programmed with insanity. You Ascap, if BMI. Could ever make a mountain fly. If Japanese can boil teas."

oasis in the night,These days there slipping away like thieves in the night. I try to hold on to them with all my might. Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast. Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last. Another tasteless coffee. Another empty day. Suddenly last night is just so far away. Too many talking heads. What was it that they said. When we're apart the days are dark. When I'm with you I'm in the light. You're my oasis in the night... yeah. You're my oasis in the night. You're my oasis in the night. You keep our love light shinning bright. You're my oasis in the night... yeah. When you're in my arms. you keep the world at bay. You stop it at the door. I don't care what they say. Time's too short. The fire's too hot. Don't know what to do. 'cause I know in a flash. It's just a memory too. Another tasteless coffee. Another empty day. Suddenly last night is just so far away. Too many talking heads. What was it that they said. When we're apart my days are dark. When I'm with you I'm in the light. You're my oasis in the night. You're my oasis in the night.

seasons of wither,Blues hearted lady. Sleepy was she. Love for the devil. Brought her to me. Seeds of a thousand. Drawn to her sin. Seasons of whither. Holdin me in. Oh woe is me. I feel so badly for you. Oh woe is me. I feel so sadly for you in time. Bound to lose your mind. Live on borrowed time. Take the wind right out of your sails. Fireflies dance in the heat of. Hound dogs bay at the moon. My ship leaves in the midnight. Can't say I'll be back too soon. They awaken. Far far away. Heat of my candle. Show me the way. Seeds of a thousand. Drawn to her sin. Seasons of whither. Holdin me in. Oh woe is me. I feel so badly for you. Oh woe is me. I feel so sadly for you in time. Bound to lose your mind. Live on borrowed time. Take the wind right out of your sails

Just what it is. That's blowin' in the wind. It's the fire in her eyes. It's the tear when she cries. It's the heat when I fall on my knees. That I'm thinkin' of.

Love has got me down. a tear just hit the ground. so I started writing you this song. but the words I wrote came out all wrong. Yeah but it's alright. When you can't define the crime. then life ain't worth a dime. when they take away everything you've got. and they rub your nose in the funky spot. Not without a fight. When they work your fingers to the bone. now what does get you - nothing. in a crowd of people. you're still alone. you hope that tells you something. the road to heaven is paved in hell. and it makes you wonder. Why we're here at all. Check out the shape of the circumstance. he wears the dress and she wears the pants. here comes Jill and she needs romance. but you can't do jack so shut up and dance!.

sing for the moment,"[Eminem]. These ideas are, nightmares to white parents. whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings. Like whatever they say has no bearing. It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing. to see him walkin around with his headphones blaring. Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care. He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out. when he talks about, his fuckin dad walkin out. Cause he just hates him so bad that he, blocks him out. If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out. His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin back. Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap. He sags his pants; doo rags and a stockin cap. His step-father hit him so he, socked him back. and broke his nose, his house is a broken home. There's no control, he just let's his emotions go. [Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]. C'mon! Sing with me (Sing!). Sing for the year (Sing it). Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (C'mon!). Sing it with me, Just for today. Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away.... [Eminem]. Entertainment is changin, intertwinin with gangsters. In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum. Holy or unnholy, only have one homie. Only this gun - lonely cause don't anyone know me. Yet everybody just feels like they can relate. I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great. or they can degrate; or even worse, they can teach hate. It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make. like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum. Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?. From standin on corners and porches just rappin. to havin a fortune, no more kissin ass. But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you. Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you. to get they hands on every dime you have. They want you to lose your mind every time you mad. So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon. Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns. That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me. Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly. But all they kids be listenin to me religiously. So I'm signin CD's while police fingerprint me. They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me. If I'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense B!. It's all political, if my music is literal. and I'm a criminal how the FUCK can I raise a little girl?. I couldn't; I wouldn't be fit to. You're full of shit too Guerrera - that was a FIST that hit you!. [Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]. C'mon! Sing with me (Sing!). Sing for the year (Sing it). Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing with me). Sing it with me, Just for today. Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away.... [Eminem]. They say music can alter moods and talk to you. Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?. Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude. Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued. See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols. and they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool. Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves. We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin our sales. You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self. We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail. It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin. to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted. That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing. except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine. Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long. Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs. Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives. 'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die. 'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe. We're nothin to you - but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes. That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it. Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden. And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spiritslive on. through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can.... [Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]. Sing with me (Sing!). Sing for the year (Sing it). Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (C'mon!). Sing it with me, Just for today. Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away.... [Chorus: Aerosmith - Steven Tyler (Dream On)]. Sing with me (Sing!). Sing for the year (Sing it). Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (C'mon!). Sing it with me, Just for today. Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away..."

something,"You're making me wait. Like there's no tomorrow.. You're taking from me. What I can't beg or borrow.. [Chorus:]. There's something that tells me that life has changed.

street jesus,"Hey have you heard the news. Somebody stole my shoes. And I can smell the booze. How indiscreet. And though I had a plan. After that thief outran. Into another man. Who had no feet. I swear to god that day. That guy with no feet say. You got to walk my way. That's how it's planned. That's when I thought ""good grief"". J-just ain't my belief. Until I saw the holes. Inside his hand. Street Jesus. Street Jesus. Come on, come on, what you think about life?. Demon in heaven gotta carry a knife. You said to me, ""no, that ain't the plan"". With a smile on his face and the holes in his hand. Wise man tell ya what they're reading from a scroll. But things kinda change when the story gets told. They tell it like it is to everybody they meet. Just to sing it in the church what they're preaching in the street. Placate and vacate your mind. Too late to vacate you'll find. Street Jesus. Street Jesus. Good god almighty, s'posed to be about love. You must've wished upon me by kissing the glove. I'm a high-stepping lover, sharp as a knife. I'm a pink flamingo on a great long life?. A wise man, poor man, beggar man too. You bet your bottom dollar but whatcha gonna do?. I can make up daylight jealous of the night. I try to play the game but I never get it right!. Placate and vacate your mind. Too late to vacate you'll find. When you wonder what's up. With your half empty cup. Say tell him ""don't give up,. Reach for the stars"". You think you're so street wise. Just pray and close your eyes. Until we colonize. The moon and stars. But wouldn't it be great. If we could wipe the slate. When we all live in hate. And all this fear. So please don't call me ""sir"". If you're whole life's a blur. And mr. bartender. Another beer. Sometimes it's hard trying to keep up the pace. The train kept a rollin' when you're trying to win the race. If you don't believe me, wanna stay in the game. You gotta know who from the heavens came. They tell it like it is to everybody they meet. Cause they're singing in the church. what they're preaching in the street. If you wanna give em hell then you tell it from the steeple. But I'd rather be a priest so I can scream it to the people. Placate and vacate your miiiiind. Too late to vacate you'll fiiiiiind. You won't get too many tries. Love is the love of my life. Street Jesus. Street Jesus. Street Jesus. Street Jesus. Who do ya. Who do ya. Who do ya. Who do ya think that you are?"

Yeah, ?cause in my mind I?m goin? out of. We had love there ain?t no doubt. I wanna get down wit?you once again. (I'm lookin' up into my eyes). I?m leavin? it up to you tell me when.

wham bam,"I got a hole in my heart. Lord I gotta do some patchin'. Got the seven year itch, girl,. We gotta do some scratchin'. Lay down momma. Got a holy resurrection. You got the oo-ee baby. That's sweeter than confection. You don't need no invitation. Grab the devil by the tail. If you got the fascination. Touch it, touch it, touch it. Make it red hot!. Wham bam - it was better than the first time. Love jam - had my fingers in the pie. Wham bam - we were swingin' from the grape vine. Wham bam - and I kissed her butterfly. You got me climbin' up the walls. Gotta scrape me off the ceiling. Slow down baby. We don't want to blow the feeling. We got the fiy-aa. like a burnin' volcano. I hope this feelin' never slips away. That is what I pray for. Yea, the train kept a rollin'. Screamin' all night long - Do it! do it!. We're gettin' down and dirty - do it! do it!"
what could have been love,"I wake up and wonder how everything went wrong. Am I the one to blame?. I gave up and left you for a nowhere-bound train. Now that train has come and gone. I close my eyes and see you lying in my bed. And I still dream of that day. What could have been love. Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be. Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me. And now that I'm alone. All I have is emptiness that comes from being free. What could have been love will never be. An old friend told me that you found somebody new. Oh, you're finally moving on. You think that I'd be over you after all these years. Yeah, but time has proved it wrong. 'Cause I'm still holdin' on. What could have been love. Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be. Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me. And now that I'm alone. All I have is emptiness that comes from being free. What could have been love will never be. We've gone our separate ways. Say goodbye to another day. I still wonder where you are. Are you too far from turning back?. You were slipping through my hands and I didn't understand. What could have been love. Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be. Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me. And now that I'm alone. All I have is emptiness that comes from being free. What could have been love will never be. What could have been love will never be. What could have been love. What could have been love. What could have been love. What could have been love"
what it takes,"There goes my old girlfriend. Well there's another diamond ring. And all those late night promises. I guess they don't mean a thing. So baby what's the story. Did you find another man. Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made. When you don't look back. I guess the feelings start to fade away. I used to feel your fire. But now it's cold inside. And you're back on the street. Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah. Tell me what it takes to let you go. Tell me how the pain's supposed to go. Tell me how it is. That you can sleep. In the night without thinking you lost. Everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice. Tell me what it takes to let you go. Girl before I met you. I was f. I. n. e. fine. But your love made me a prisoner. Yeah my heart's been doin' time. Spent me up like money. Well then you hung me out to dry. It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise. 'cause you had me deep with the devil in your eyes. Tell me what it takes to let you go. Tell me how the pain's supposed to go. Tell me how it is. That you can sleep. In the night without thinking you lost. Everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice. Tell me what it takes to let you go. Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own. Tell me that it's better when you're all alone. Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch. Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much. Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me. Tell me what it takes to let you go. Tell me how the pain's supposed to go. Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night. Without thinking you lost. Everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice. Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice (no no no no). 'cause I don't wanna burn in paradise. (let it go let it go...)"

yo mamma,"I met a little girl who was so high class (totally). I was as lonely as can be she had a beautiful *. She was lonely. She showed me her tattoo it was right there On her breast. Somewhere in a city in the middle of the West. When she asked me to her house. Little did I know she was only. She was just 18 still livin' with her folks. She was only. And when I met her momma she undressed me With her eyes. Then her daddy gave a look at me. That could have paralyzed. 'Cause your mamma wants to do me and your. Daddy wants to do me in. I'm a cat with nine lives I hope that I. Can make it to ten. O'cherry please forgive me for confessin'. My original sin. Because your mamma wants to do me. And your daddy wants to do me in!. (dialogue to chorus). In the morning as I gingerly tipped toed. Down the stairs, I had this deja voodoo. That maybe I already had been there. Then it all came back to me that night back in 1973."
