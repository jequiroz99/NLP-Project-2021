I ain't feeling no better. Roadkill heart inside of me. Follow it to the letter. Sundown brings a welcome change. Everything that's hiding. More at home in landscapes strange. Are you selling?. I'm buying. Breath on a window showing tic tac toe. Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home. Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul. Connect the dot scribbling. And you would never know. Failed to heed the signal. Thought you got through just in time. Crashing hard upon your ego. Penetrated from the side. I'd let you go, but you're always in the way. I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday. I'd love to go, but you're always in the way. I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday"

hollow,"Turning in circles, slowing down. Pulling against a closing out. Easy to feed off a weaker thing. Harder to say what I really mean. Chorus:. Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below. Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky. All of your colors turn to grey. Don't even matter anyway. Bleeding impressions where you were tied. Can't really say how you lost your mind. Chorus:. Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below. Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold. Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below. Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky. Silence so loud, silence. I can't tell my up from down. Silence so loud, Silence. I can't tell my uṗ from down. All of the faces life can show. Withered and ugly the one you know. Chorus:. Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below. Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky. Silence so loud, silence. I can't tell my up from down. Silence so loud, Silence. I can't tell my up from down."
hung on a hook,"Hung on a hook I'm a mirror. Cracked down the center I split you. Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes. Show you the face of a man who. Not that he wants but he has to. Look at the thing he's become, what I see. I'm caught in a still life with no frame. Sometimes people do, the world it don't change. Give up awaiting someday. Future between a gun and your head. Pieces of me on a tile floor. Look up at you as you change more. Floating in fear I appear a hundred times. Hold a reflection inside me. I cannot feel you are empty. Throw me away. I am broken not your time. I'm caught in a still life with no frame. Sometimes people do, the world it don't change. Give up awaiting someday. Future between a gun and your head. Not gonna save you. Perform euthanasia"

it ain't like that,"There I was, laid out on a table. Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor. In my life, I'd not soften. Things that cut, and burn so often. But I sit, think of somethin'. Scared to face, the dyin' nothin'. [Chorus]. See the cycle I've waited for. It ain't like that anymore. Where I go is when I feel I'm able. How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore. In my mind, not forgotten. Feel as though, a tooth were rotten. Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin'. Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin'. [Chorus]. Here I sit writing on the paper. Trying to think of words you can't ignore. In my eyes, what I'm lacking. Score at face, a ten for slacking. Sign the deal, set in motion. Smaller fish, so huge the ocean. [Chorus]"
