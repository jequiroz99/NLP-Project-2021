Yes, I think I'm okay. Walked into the door again. If you ask that's what I'll say. And it's not your business anyway. I guess I'd like to be alone. With nothing broken, nothing thrown.

mrs. robinson,And here's to you Mrs. Robinson. Jesus loves you more than you will know. God bless you please Mrs. Robinson. Heaven holds a place for those who pray. We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files. We'd like to help you to learn to help yourself. Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes. Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home. And here's to you Mrs. Robinson. Jesus loves you more than you will know. God bless you please Mrs. Robinson. Heaven holds a place for those who pray. Hide it in a hideing place where no one ever goes. Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes. It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair. Most of all you got to hide it from the kids. Coo coo cachoo. Mrs. Robinson. Jesus loves you more than you will know. God bless you please Mrs. Robinson. Heaven holds a place for those who pray. Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon. Going to the candidates debate. Laugh about it shout about it when you got to choose. Every way you look at it you loose. Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio. A nation turns its lonely eyes to you. What's that you say Mrs. Robinson. Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
it's all true,"I haven't cried baby since I learned to talk. Haven't fallen down since I learned to walk. And I don't get bored watching the tube. And I never had a rock in my shoe. And if I tried baby, would you mess me 'round?. Would we both get bored by the simple sound. Sorry about dropping that lude. It just seemed like the best thing to do. It's all true. I got me. She's got you. And we got time to share a few. You never get me down when I'm feeling blue. When I tell you lies you won't believe they're true. Now I really should be on my way. Think I'm gonna stick around all day. It's all true. I got me. She's got you. And we got time to share a few. She's so precise with her exacto knife. She's gonna take her life. I don't wake up with a sudden start. With some empty arms and a broken heart. And I don't get bored watching the tube."
year of the cat,"On a morning from a Bogart movie. In a country where they turn back time. You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre. Contemplating a crime. She comes out of the sun in a silk dress. running like a watercolour in the rain. Don't bother asking for explanations. She'll just tell you that she came. In the year of the cat. . . She doesn't give you time for questions. As she locks up your arm in hers. And you follow. 'till your sense of which direction. Completely disappears. By the blue tiled walls. near the market stalls. There's a hidden door she leads you to. These days, she says,. I feel my life Just like a river running thru. The year of the cat. Well, she looks at you so cooly. And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea. She comes in incense and patchouli. So you take her, to find what's waiting inside. The year of the cat. Well, morning comes and you're still with her. And the bus and the tourists are gone. And you've thrown away the choice. and lost your ticket. So you have to stay on. But the drum-beat strains of the night remain. In the rhythm of the new-born day. You know sometime you're bound to leave her. But for now you're going to stay. In the year of the cat. . . . ."
into your arms,"I know a place where I can go, when I'm alone. Into your arms. Whoa, into your arms. I can go. I know a place that's safe and warm from the crowd. Into your arms, whoa. Into your arms. And If I should fall .... I know I won't be alone.. Be alone anymore"

live without,"Kill the longing,. Though I know I'm lying to myself. It's an eccentric gift. Gathering dust on the shelf. Still feverish;. Say dies -- one wish. New stars, old sky:. Lies satisfy. How can you live without losing anything?. What do you give the girl who has everything?. While the months go by. And I can almost touch you. I pull back from your hand. Because I want too much to. Hat full of rain. Clean & profane. Though impolite. Can this be right?. I can't -- can't stop you. Do what you want to. What's left -- left over?. Some song you wrote her..."

I'm too much with myself, I wanna be someone else.. I'm too much with myself, I wanna be someone else.. So we take off out Fiona's door,. Walk until it's light outside,. Like before when we were on the phone.. We have to laugh to look at each other.. We have to laugh 'cause we're not alone.. As the cars fly up King St.. It's enough to startle us,. It's enough to startle us. I love my drug buddy. My drug, my drug buddy.. I love my drug buddy. My drug, my drug buddy.."
keep on loving you,You should have seen by the look in my eyes baby. There was something missing. Should’ve known by the tone of my voice maybe. But you didn’t listen. You played dead but you never bled. Instead you laid still in the grass all coiled up and hissing. And though I know all about all those men. Still I don’t remember. ‘Cos it was us baby way before them. And we’re still together. And I meant every word that I said. When I said I love you it meant that I’ll love you forever. And I’m gonna keep on loving you. ‘Cos it’s the only thing I wanna do. I don’t wanna sleep I just wanna keep on loving you. And I meant every word that I said.

Every business weekly. What's Amanda say?. It's not that I'm so strong. I never knew what hit me. Since you came to stay, yeah. Speard and flayed. Burnt and bleeding, I'll catch up some day.

For awhile. Love the world. Enough to smile. Friends will come and friends will go. But I'll always be here. When the trees are bare on the sky. I won't have to tell you not to cry. Season come and seasons go. I'll always be here"

december,"I'm not keepin' up your side of the bargain. As we all know, a woman's will can harden. You try and soften up the blow. Still I hate to see you go. I beg your pardon. A swimming pool that used to be a garden. Get it started. Bake someone a cake and fold my heart in. Drive around the lake and roll my car in. Roll my car in. Is it time to pull my chestnuts from the fire?. Oh my my. Should I diversify or keep my powder dry. It's early in the day. Still it's late enough to say you were a liar. And the truth becomes more clear as I get higher. Find a buyer. Claim yourself exempt and wear a wire. Sleep around until you're good and tired. Good and tired. Watch it bubble out of sight. Tell me psycho where's the knife. Set your watch to ruin my life. Yeah, tell yourself you're not my type. You're not keepin' up my side of the bargain. As we all know, a woman's will can harden. Try and soften up the blow. Still I hate to see you go. I beg your pardon"

We heard a big thud and we were thrown out of the boat. So we drowned in the glassy water. Deep bottom cove, bottom cove, bottom cove. Deep bottom cove, bottom cove, bottom cove.

different drum,"You and I travel to the beat of a different drum. Oh, can’t you tell by the way I run, every time you make eyes at me. You cry, and moan, and say it’ll work out. But honey child, I’ve got my doubts. You can’t see the forest for the trees. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I’d knock it. It’s just that I, I’m not in the market for a girl who wants to love only me. And I ain’t saying you ain’t pretty, all I’m saying’s I’m not ready. For any person place or thing to try and pull the reins in on me. So, goodbye, I don’t believe and I see no sense. In this crying and grieving, we’ll both live a lot longer if you live without me"

Time to die, You're welcome, You just overstayed it. I simplify the card was dealt before you played it. Your sense of community is kinda dated. Taking care Jerusalem is locked and gated. Making sure we all hate who we always hated. Till your lust for blood is well and truly sated. If I knew that you were coming. I'd have stayed awake. If you knew where you were going. I'd be interested. Miles of fields and it's snowing. On a frozen lake. If I knew that you were coming. I'd have stayed awake"

If I make it through today,. I’ll know tomorrow not to put my feelings out on display.. I’ll put the cobwebs back in place.. I’ve never been to good with names,. But I remember faces."

She's got you. And we got time to share a few. You never get me down when I'm feeling blue. When I tell you lies you won't believe they're true. Now I really should be on my way.

You played dead but you never bled. Instead you laid still in the grass all coiled up and hissing. And though I know all about all those men.

no backbone,"It's dawned on me again. I can't balance in betweens. It's no longer familiar to me. It's become routine. The bedroom ritual. A simple way to feel.

Numb and flashing off and on. Dying in your heart. Dying in your heart. Dying in your heart. Grab a hold and don't say when. Shattered on the floor. Trying not to lose it all. Your eyes like an iron wall. Waiting for the axe to fall. Fire on the ocean go. Sun is sinking far below. Glowing cold but always gone. Numb and flashing off and on. Dying in your heart. Dying in your heart. Dying in your heart"

Love is heat with a light. love's a sound you can't hear. When we're far far apart,. when we're too near. If I could show you. the picture in my heart. If I could stop the words. before they start..... (repeat verse riff). (repeat chorus riff). End on E5.."
year of the cat,"On a morning from a Bogart movie. In a country where they turn back time. You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre. Contemplating a crime. She comes out of the sun in a silk dress. running like a watercolour in the rain. Don't bother asking for explanations. She'll just tell you that she came. In the year of the cat. . . She doesn't give you time for questions. As she locks up your arm in hers. And you follow. 'till your sense of which direction. Completely disappears. By the blue tiled walls. near the market stalls. There's a hidden door she leads you to. These days, she says,. I feel my life Just like a river running thru. The year of the cat. Well, she looks at you so cooly. And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea. She comes in incense and patchouli. So you take her, to find what's waiting inside. The year of the cat. Well, morning comes and you're still with her. And the bus and the tourists are gone. And you've thrown away the choice. and lost your ticket. So you have to stay on. But the drum-beat strains of the night remain. In the rhythm of the new-born day. You know sometime you're bound to leave her. But for now you're going to stay. In the year of the cat. . . . ."

your home is where you're happy,"Your home is where you’re happy. It’s not where you’re not free. Your home is where you can be what you are. As you were just born to be. Now they’ll show you their castles. And diamonds for all to see. But, they’ll never show you their peace of mind. ‘Cause they don’t know how to be free. So burn all your bridges. Leave your past behind. You can do what you want to do. ‘Cause you’re strong in your mind. And, anywhere you might wander. You can make that your home. Just as long as you’ve got love in your heart. You’ll never be alone. Just as long as you’ve got love in your heart. You’ll never be alone. You’ll never be alone."
