The doorman winks at you on your way out. 'Cause deep inside he knows you'll be returning. And he's got something you can't live without. There's nothing new that can be said about dirt. And there's nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt. Of an old love's fancy life that left you stranded in a dream. Ain't you glad you're a high fashion queen.

You see this box beneath my arm?. To you it's plain, it has no charm. But to someone dearest to my heart. This box has played a tragic part. This little one can't tell you himself. About his life and how he died.. But if anyone else could speak for him,. I guess I'm qualified.. This boy was in Chicago he didn't know why he was there.. He was with his family and friends and he didn't really care.. You might have been one of those who saw. The struggle there on your television screen. The tragic thing is so much else happened. That no one else could have seen.. A stranger handed this boy a dollar. To do a simple chore. To carry a package to a nearby hotel.. And when he returned he'd get two more. But when he came back he sort of lost his way walking through the crowd.. One of them things you ask yourself,. How the Lord allowed. But when he was found he was like he is now,dreaming sweet and still.. And in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill.. Now you can take that dollar. Get four cents on it, compound it quarterly at any downtown bank.. So they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb.. Well, what I'm going to tell you now, you can stay or you can leave.. You kind o"

to ramona,"Ramona come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes. The pangs of your sadness. Shall pass as your senses will rise. But the flowers of the city. Thou breath like yet. Death like thee at times. There's no use in trying. To deal with the dying. Though I can not explain that in rhymes. Your cracked country lips. I still wish to kiss. Have to be by the touch of your skin. Your magnetic movements. Still capture the moments I'm in. It grieves my heart, love. To see you trying. To be a part of a world. That just don't exist. It's all just a scheme, babe. A vaccum of dreams. That sucks you into. Feeling like this. I've heard you say many times. That your better than no one. And no one is better than you. If you really believe that. You know you have nothing to win. And nothing to lose. From fixtures and forces and friends. Your sorrow does stem. They'll hype you and type. A make you feel. That you got to be just like them. I'd forever talk to you. But soon my words would turn. Into a meaningless ring. For deep in my heart. There's no help I can bring. Everything passes everything changes. Just do what you think you should do. Then someday maybe. Who knows, baby. I'll come and be crying to you"
