Je ne regrette rien. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. It was all so cosy. Her world of lillipinks. Rubbing all my glitter. On my litter to sink in. Washing with the paste. She used for the gaze.

Je ne regrette rien. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. I am Jekyll when I'm Hyde. I'm a demon locked inside. I am restless when I sleep. I'm the beauty and the beast. She knew me. Yet she said. There's no regrets. Why's love and hate. Always a step ahead. What's left. Caught in betrayal. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. We failed. Je ne regrette rien

after the rain,Bitter sweet memories. Of a love we had before. Blinded by sanity. What's behind the crimson door?. What happened to my eyes. Incapable of seeing signs. There's just one miracle. That's left of this love. After the rain. I still see heaven crying. After the rain. I still feel no relief. Cause everything we used to be. And used to feel. It all becomes so frightening real. After the rain. Rainbow skies turned to grey. Ever since we lost our smile. Innocence gone astray. Since the day we said goodbye. What happened to our dreams. Aborted in this dried out stream. There's just one miracle. That's left of this love. After the rain. I still see heaven crying. After the rain. I still feel no relief. Cause everything we used to be. And used to feel. It all becomes so frightening real. After the rain. After the rain. I still see heaven crying. After the rain. I still feel no relief. Cause everything we used to be. And used to feel. It all becomes so frightening real. After the rain
american beauty,Like a spider to a fly she sang. I was tangled in her web. I lived to see her smile until I saw the fangs. Was I lost in a mirage or was it in me. American beauty - just an illusion of a girl. American beauty - Spreading her image to the world. I couldn't have tried to fight her to deny her. I'd - A died to lie beside her. Wrong or right she was mine - American beauty. Every whisper drew me closer still. Every breath we seemed to share. I couldn't turn away she moved in for the kill. Did i give in to the bait or lead it to me. American beauty - just an illusion of a girl. American beauty - Spreading her image to the world. I couldn't have tried to fight her to deny her. I'd - A died to lie beside her. Wrong or right she was mine - American beauty. No more the same is she to blame. Or am I responsible because I came. Moth to a flame I surrendered to her pull. I'd - A died to lie beside her. Wrong or right she was mine for a night. American beauty - just an illusion of a girl. American beauty - Spreading her image to the world. American beauty - Still I can feel her in my veins. American beauty - Part of me now forever stained. I couldn't have tried to fight her to deny her. I'd - A died to lie beside her.

je ne regrette rien,We all have our secrets. They're better left unsaid. We all have our issues. That we want to forget. I was getting kicks. Out of my box of tricks. I was playing with her mind. Planting bombs to get inside. But now favorite toy has left. and she said. There's no regrets. Why's love and hate. Always a step ahead. What's left. Caught in betrayal. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. It was all so cosy. Her world of lillipinks. Rubbing all my glitter. On my litter to sink in. Washing with the paste. She used for the gaze. I was cutting up her. Edges with disgrace. But now my favorite toy has left. and she said. There's no regrets. Why's love and hate. Always a step ahead. What's left. Caught in betrayal. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. I am Jekyll when I'm Hyde. I'm a demon locked inside. I am restless when I sleep. I'm the beauty and the beast. She knew me. Yet she said. There's no regrets. Why's love and hate. Always a step ahead. What's left. Caught in betrayal. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. We failed. Je ne regrette rien. We failed. Je ne regrette rien

out of love,As I was searching for some cookies in an empty jar. I realised some days are made to press restart. I wasn't listening you stopped asking. We watched our beauty fade away. Come open sesame if I just had one wish to make. It would be that we'd meet I'd fall for you and love again. But there's no jeanny in a bottle where did we go. wrong. So wrong. Oh - So much gone. Out of love. Caught in a trap. No truning back. When you are out of love. It's all said and done. And you're still holding on yet. You are out of love. Out of love. Caught in a trap. No truning back. When you are out of love. It's all said and done. And you're still holding on yet. You are out of love. Blackmailed emotion for a picture in a pretty frame. We were amazing but our dreams deleted in our face. I couldn't tell you when it started and where we went wrong. So wrong. Oh - So much gone. Out of love. Caught in a trap. No truning back. When you are out of love. It's all said and done. And you're still holding on yet. You are out of love. Out of love. Caught in a trap. No truning back. When you are out of love. It's all said and done. And you're still holding on yet. You are out of love. Lost poetry - so much there but none of us. Just a hologram of something that we shared. Out of love. Out of love. Caught in a trap. No truning back. When you are out of love. It's all said and done. And you're still holding on yet. You are out of love. Out of love. Caught in a trap. No truning back.

sad day (for happiness),"I'll meet you on the other side. in the apple of my eye. Let us paint a scenery. in a colour we can see. Switch the news off, go to sleep. fight the tears in misery. I've exchanged my childhood dreams. for a bunch of make-believes. Touch the button. you should sit and listen. Watching as a tear. rains in to a broken heart. It's a sad day for happiness. in this crazy world. It's a crazy world. so all we can do is be. a little crazy to save today. And take the Storys. made to please. in us glossing magazines. my nexter nighbour never speaks. the curtains closed with seventeen. Touch the button. you should sit and listen. Watching as a tear. rains in to a broken heart. It's a sad day for happiness. in this crazy world. It's a crazy world. so all we can do is be. a little crazy to save today. Candy kiss and ring ding. Fairground noise and lots of bling. How much is a four leafed clover. Riding on my rollercoaster. It's a sad day for happiness. In this crazy world. It's a crazy world. so all we can do. Is be a little crazy to save today"
she waits for me,"Two weeks have passed since she last asked me for an answer and I'm sorry now. but thinking back I thought that maybe I could please you but I can't so now. I made your bed while you were in the shower. I guess I think at a hundred miles an hour. And any minute she'll be back to ask me if I got the answer now. Still she waits for me. Still she waits for me. Miss independent, you've got everything you need to make it on your own. You say you're happy but I know that you're still waiting on the telephone. We started out when everything was easy. But you're still thinking about the way we could have been. Two weeks have passed since she last asked me for an answer and I'm sorry now. Still she waits for me. Still she waits for me. Still she waits for me. Still she waits for me. I'm putting pressure on my wounds to stop the bleeding but I'm passing out. Can't ask me back or make me better you're the devil and you bring me down. Don't want to tell you about the way I really feel. But you're still pushing a heart that`s only made of steel. And any minute you'll be back to ask me if I got the answer now. Still she waits for me. Still she waits for me. Still she waits for me. Still she waits for me"
silent scream,I was walking in the shadows. So nobody can´t. Your smile led me from the distance. And without the smallest chance. All these memories. They come back. When I´m asleep. You´ve taken my dreams. I don´t need no fakes around me. All I want is you to be with me. Here I am. All these words they have lost their meaning. I just hope you hear my silent screams. I still hear the distant voices. Spreading rumours and lies. I took you to my darkest places. So far away from the sky. I watch on you. We merose. To not let go. But where are you now?. I don´t need no fakes around me. All I want is you to be with me. Here I am. All these words they have lost their meaning. I just hope you hear my silent screams. Half so numb can't you hear me. Here I am. There is on in inside me. Is true is to feel
spaceman,Chorus:. Spaceman. I always wanted you to go into space man. . Pungent smells. They consumate my home. Beyond the black horizon. Trying to take control. See my girl. She shivers in her bones. The sun and zenith rising. Trying to take us all. There's a fire between us. So where is your god. There's a fire between us. I can't get off the carousel. I can't get off this world. The sickening taste of homophobic jokes. Images of fascist folks. Beam me up 'cause I can't breathe. Chorus:. Spaceman. I always wanted you to go into space man.. . It's time to terminate this great white world. Morbid fascination. Television takes control. Decimation. Different races fall. Electronic information tampers with your soul. There's a fire between us. So where is your god?. There's a fire between us. I can't get off the carousel - I can't get of this world. The sickening taste of homophobic jokes. Images of fascist folks. Beam me up 'cause I can't breathe. Chorus:. Spaceman. I always wanted you to go into space man
tears in vegas,You're too ashamed to tell 'em how you feel. You hide your heart too scared to reveal. The broken scars that are beggin' to be healed by you.
