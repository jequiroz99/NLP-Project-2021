eye of the tiger,"Risin' up, back on the street. Did my time, took my chances. Went the distance now I'm back on my feet. Just a man and his will to survive. So many times it happens too fast. You trade your passion for glory. Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past. You must fight just to keep them alive. It's the eye of the tiger. It's the thrill of the fight. Rising up to the challenge of our rival. And the last known survivor. Stalks his prey in the night. And he's watching us all. With the eye of the tiger. Face to face, out in the heat. Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry. They stack the odds still we take to the street. For the kill, with the skill to survive. It's the eye of the tiger. It's the thrill of the fight. Rising up to the challenge of our rival. And the last known survivor. Stalks his prey in the night. And he's watching us all. With the eye of the tiger. Risin' up, straight to the top. Had the guts, got the glory. Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop. Just a man and his will to survive. It's the eye of the tiger. It's the thrill of the fight. Rising up to the challenge of our rival. And the last known survivor. Stalks his prey in the night. And he's watching us all. With the eye of the tiger. The eye of the tiger. The eye of the tiger. The eye of the tiger. The eye of the tiger"
burning heart,"Two worlds collide - rival nations,. It's a primitive clash - venting years of frustrations,. Bravely we hope against all hope -. there is so much at stake.. Seems our freedom's up against the ropes.. Does the crowd understand?. Is a East versus West, or man against man,. Can any nation stand - alone.. *In the burning heart - just about to burst,. There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst,. In the darkest night - rising like a spire,. In the burning heart. the unmistakable fire.*. In the warriors code - there's no surrender,. Though his body says stop - his spirit cries - never!. Deep in our soul a quiet ember,. Knows it's you against you, it's the. Paradox that drives us on -. It's a battle of wills, in the heat of attack,. It's the passion that kills -. The victory is yours alone.. (* Repeat)"
high on you,"There you stood, that'll teach ya. To look so good and feel so right. Let me tell you about the girl I met last night. It's understood. I had to reach her. I let the wheel of fortune spin. I touched your hand before the crowd. Started rushin' in. Now I'm higher than a kite. I know I'm gettin' hooked on your love. Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heart. Beggin' for your touch in the middle. Of the street and I. I can't stop thinking' bout you, girl. I must be living in a fantasy world. I'm so high on you. Smart and coy, a little crazy. The kinda face that starts a fight. Let me tell you 'bout the girl I had last night. Piercing eyes, like a raven. You seemed to share my secret sin. We were high before the night. Started kickin' in. Now I'm screamin' in the night. I know I'm gettin' hooked on your love. Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat. Beggin' for your touch in the middle. Of the street and I. I can't stop thinking' bout you, girl. I must be living in a fantasy world. I've searched the whole world over. To find a heart so true. Such complete intoxication. I'm high on you. There you stood, that'll teach ya. To look so good and feel so right. Let me tell you about the girl I met last night. Now I'm higher than a kite. I know I'm gettin' hooked on your love. Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat. Beggin' for your touch in the middle. Of the street and I. Chorus - I can't stop thinking 'bout you, girl. I must be living in a fantasy world.

is this love,I've heard talk of blind devotion. Lovers through thick and thin. Lives touched with real emotion. Faithful till the bitter end. Now I must admit that the story's attractive. I've lost in far too many affairs. I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring. I need to prove to myself. This is more than a crush. Can you convince me it's not just a physical rush. (Chorus:). Is this love that I'm feelin'. Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night. Is this love that I'm feelin'. Is this love. So many nights in blind confusion. I've walked the line of love. We reach out in disillusion. When one night isn't nearly enough. Now I'd like to know that for once in my life. I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring. I've heard all your talk. Can I take it to heart. Now look me straight in the eye. 'Cause tonight is the night. We've got to ask each other if the moment is right. (Chorus). I've tread those mean streets. Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands. All touch. No feeling just another one night stand. I need to know that there's someone who cares. Could you be the angel to answer my prayers. (Chorus)
fire makes steel,"Under the gum, the game can get rough,. I'm feeling no pain,calling it's bluff, it's bluff,. Just crossing the finish line, been breaking all the rules,. Out of the ice, the pressure can get to you.. Whatever it takes to stop the fire inside,. I'm ready to feel that breath tonight.. Cause fire makes steel, you're as hot as you feel,. When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,. When they're hard on your heels, yet fire makes steel,. The hunger inside keeps driving me on.. Fire makes steel.. There's no way to take the easy way out, no,. It doesn't exist in a world full of doubt, of doubt,. A fumble I'm searching for, I say:""No pain, no gain"",. You do it your way, I do it mine.. Whatever it takes to stop the fire inside,. I'm ready to feel that breath tonight.. Cause fire makes steel, you're as hot as you feel,. When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,. When they're hard on your heels, yet fire makes steel,. The hunger inside keeps driving me on.. Don't you know!. Cause fire makes steel, you're as hot as you feel,. When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,. When they're hard on your heels, yet fire makes steel,.

didn't know it was love,"It felt so easy in the morning sun. When love was in season I was on the run. I was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chase. Love was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to face. One touch should've told me, try and understand. Love was always a long shot to a gambling man. With a roll of the dice, girl I threw it away. Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day. *Didn't know it was love. Didn't know it was fate. Didn't know it was destiny callin'. Tell me it's never too late. Was I too blind to see. When push came to shove. You were all that I needed. Didn't know it was love*. Wasn't blind to the magic, you think I'm so tough. Turning back on the thunder just ain't good enough. I keep trying to shake you, there just ain't no way. Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day. (* Repeat). Those crazy nights on the borderline. Did my best to cut myself free. Stood alone, just a prisoner. Never knew you were holdin' the key. (* Repeat)."

I'm only a man against the world. And love, like a distant reminder. It tugs at my shoulder. It calls me home. I shout, can a single voice carry. Will I find sanctuary within your arms. Someday when the answer's clearer. Someday when I even the score. You'll reach and you'll find me near you. Right beside you. Forevermore. But for now I'll walk the night alone. Like a man against the world. A brand new day will shine. Through the avalanche of time. Now the road's grown long, but the spirit's strong. And the fire within still burns. Alone I take my stand. I give you a man against the world."

hungry years,"Would you still love me, if just perhaps. The roof above our heads should suddenly collapse. Would you still take me, for what I am. If I had nothinâ€™. This heartâ€™s an engine, itâ€™s running lean. Iâ€™m down to skin and bone and still Iâ€™m fightinâ€™ clean. Do you share this vision, this reckless dream. Like the day we met.. If we work together we can pull this train. Canâ€™t wait forever for the winds of change. Will you stand beside me like you did before. When the storm is at the window. And the wolf is at the door. *These are the hungry years. Stand up and face your fears. Your faith can fight these tears. These are the hungry years*. Sometimes I watch you as you sleep. So safely unaware we might be in to deep. I hide my feelings behind these shades. Like you donâ€™t see. And if we pull together we can make this climb. With a love as tough as these desperate times. Will you stand beside me like you did before. Now the storme is at the window. And the wolf is at the door. ( * Repeat). Do you remember the feelings we had. Baby, the first time we touched. Is there a way to find it again. Girl is that asking too much - too much."

i never stopped loving you,"From a distance I can see, the picture looks so clear to me --. It's a vantage point so few can hope to find,. And patience held the key, our love our only guarantee,. Our destiny to make it through the night. Through the tears and through the pain,. This house was built to stand the strain,. Through harder times I surely can't recall,. And crazy as it seems, through all we had were crazy dreams,. Those hungry years I'll miss the most of all --. *Now at last, we fall together,. We've been through it all together --. Ooh, I never stopped lovin' you. When the money was short. And dreams were shattered. Faith in love was all. That pulled us through. I never stopped lovin' you*. I've stumbled on the way, so many nights love went astray --. At different times we each played separate fools,. But love became our pride, when once we'd seen the other side --. Every highway led me back to you. Through the wind and through the rain,. This house was built to stand the strain. Though harder times I surely can't recall. ( * Repeat). From a distance I can see, The picture looks so clear to me,. A vantage point that only love can find."
i see you in everyone,"Every night, a fleeting glimpse of candlelight. Chases cross the atmosphere but you're not here. And I see the shape of moonlight on the cityscape. But now the skyline wears a shroud. I see your voice in every crowd. Listening for your footsteps in every hallway. Watching for your headlights around the bend. I can see you standing in every doorway. Out in the street, in every glance. I see your reflection, I fall in a trance. Can't you see what I've become?. It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone. Day by day, I watch the moment slip away. And traces of reality come back to me. Then I see your face somewhere in a distant place. The fantasy has gone too far. I close my eyes and there you are. I can see you standing in every doorway. I can feel your heartbeat, I hear your voice. And hiding in my shadow you're with me always. Out in the street, in every glance. I see your reflection, I fall in a trance. You can't know what you have done. I see you in everyone, in everyone. In the night I see your eyes. From every direction a different disguise. Can't you see what I've become?. It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone. Out in the street, in every glance. I see your reflection, I fall in a trance. Can't you see what you have done. I see you in everyone, in everyone. In the night I see your eyes. From every direction a different disguise. Can't you see what I've become?. It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone. You can't know what you have done. It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone"
i'm not that man anymore,"Teardrops, falling from your eyes like raindrops,. Pouring from the skies,. Remember, you used to have the love I needed, back when we were young. Lovin' always came so easy, heaven shared our love,. Magic, the first time that I held you, you fit like a glove.. You'd soothe me, with a shrug of your heart you could move me,. It always seemed my love would find you, when you needed a friend. I would be the man who would understand you,. *But I'm not that man anymore,. And I'm not gonna throw my heart away,. No, that's not me anymore,. Baby I've changed. *. One look is all it took to tell me your love was made of lies,. Madness to think that I believed your reasons, your alibis,. The day girl, when I turned to look the other way girl,. I realized the game you were playin' was breakin' my heart,. I can see it plainly, time has changed me.. ( * Repeat)."
in good faith,"There's a place within my heart. Tucked away from all the pain. And deep within this secret side of me. Just the simple truth remains. Words don't come easy. Feelings I hide even from myself. I'm ready to share without hesitation. I've been saving this moment. For someone who's saving this moment too. --Tell me it's you. *I'll give you everything that I got. Say you'll never turn and run. Cause each and every beat of my heart. Tells me you're the only one. I've cast aside, my foolish pride. I know I can keep you satisfied. I'll prove it tonight in so many ways. --That's a promise from the heart. --In good faith*. In the roles that we have chosen. Behind the parts we sometimes play. Lies the passage to the real me. --With no illusions in the way. Words don't come easy. But I'll get the feeling across somehow. --Let it be now.... ( * Repeat). Behind these eyes tonight. The truth comes shining. A fire that is rarely seen. It burns for you. I've never needed anyone this way. Could never find the right words to say. --Until today.

is this love,I've heard talk of blind devotion. Lovers through thick and thin. Lives touched with real emotion. Faithful till the bitter end. Now I must admit that the story's attractive. I've lost in far too many affairs. I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring. I need to prove to myself. This is more than a crush. Can you convince me it's not just a physical rush. (Chorus:). Is this love that I'm feelin'. Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night. Is this love that I'm feelin'. Is this love. So many nights in blind confusion. I've walked the line of love. We reach out in disillusion. When one night isn't nearly enough. Now I'd like to know that for once in my life. I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring. I've heard all your talk. Can I take it to heart. Now look me straight in the eye. 'Cause tonight is the night. We've got to ask each other if the moment is right. (Chorus). I've tread those mean streets. Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands. All touch. No feeling just another one night stand. I need to know that there's someone who cares. Could you be the angel to answer my prayers. (Chorus)
it doesn't have to be this way,"Sometimes alone at night I lie and wonder --. Was breaking up the only thing to do. We live our separate lives like perfect strangers,. But in the end, we're really perfect fools --. Maybe in time we'll shake the memories,. Maybe in time forget the pain --. But baby tonight, this heart remembers. *It doesn't have to be this way --. We don't need to live the lie anymore. I want you back, I'm holding on --. It doesn't have to be this way. Here we stand -- love's an open door,. It doesn't have to be this way*. With breakin' up there comes this empty feelin'. The child within you, lost without a prayer. So you run a little wild searching for some meaning. Deep into the streets of your despair. What does it take to shake your memory --. What in the world could ease the pain. How can I make your heart surrender. ( * Repeat). ( * Repeat)."
"it's the singer, not the song","It's just another summer,. You hear a different drummer. You're looking for a way to check out from this grind. You wrestle with temptation,. Your job is sheer frustration. 'Cause there's a lifetime chance you've yet to find. Still you wonder if you've got the clout. To make it happen in this cold-hearted town. And you're feelin' that you're trapped. You wonder should you just stop tryin'. Well take a message from the man. Who's not afraid to come on strong. When there's magic in the music. It's the singer not the song. When it's comin' from the heart. All the people sing along. It's the man behind the music. It's the singer not the song. Inside you heart is achin'. There's challenge for the taking. So shoot it from the hip. Believe in what you say. You're calling this your best fight. You're looking for the limelight. Reachin' for a star to guide you on your way. Well give the glory to the man. Who's not afraid to come on strong. When there's magic in the music. It's the singer not the song. When it's comin' from the heart. All the people sing along. It's the man behind the music. It's the singer not the song"
jackie don't go,"Jackie was the focus of my fantasies. There was passion in the schoolyard. Upon the autumn leaves. Cuttin' class was gettin' easy,. Throwin' good sense down the drain,. And while your touch would always please me,. It was love that erased the pain --. Believin' that good times forever last,. Now love is a thing of the past. *Jackie no, Jackie don't go,. You're a hard act to follow --. Jackie go slow, Jackie please,. I'm down on my knees, let's do it again*. I was head over heels, I was hard in love,. I put Jackie on a pedestal so high above,. Rock 'n' Roll became our savior --. That alone was all it took --. And when it came to fool behavior,. Me and Jackie, we wrote the book. Believin' that good friends forever last,. Now love is a thing of the past. ( * Repeat). ( * Repeat). Jackie stay -- I'm living each day. In the streets of the city callin' your name. Jackie please, this is insane,. Let's do it again.

Someday to take the stage. With a rock and roll band*. **And I would play in the light of a thousand smiles. (And the sound would be heard for a thousand miles).

And you heart can't find the words. Tossed upon the sand. I give you a man against the world. All the people cheer 'til the end is near. And the hero takes a fall. Then they'll drag you through the mud. You're only flesh and blood. I have walked the path from dark to light. And they've yet to come to terms. Alone I take my stand. I'm only a man against the world. And love, like a distant reminder. It tugs at my shoulder. It calls me home. I shout, can a single voice carry. Will I find sanctuary within your arms. Someday when the answer's clearer. Someday when I even the score. You'll reach and you'll find me near you. Right beside you. Forevermore. But for now I'll walk the night alone. Like a man against the world. A brand new day will shine. Through the avalanche of time. Now the road's grown long, but the spirit's strong. And the fire within still burns. Alone I take my stand. I give you a man against the world."

Craving your touch, oh, under its spell. Knowing for certain that no one on earth. Could love you so well. And I know that you're wondering now. If only we could go back to square one. If finally we could pinpoint, where we lost touch. I stand alone, reaching out my hand to you. (Chorus)"

She's a popular girl. Such a popular girl*. She walks down the street, knocks 'em dead on their feet. With a casual nonchalance. When she's breaking your heart, she's the state of the art. With license to take what she wants. It takes a hard man to hold her, she likes to get a little out of line. ( * Repeat). She waits by the window, the world is her stage. Each smile is her mirror in the passing parade, passing parade. And in the end, all she'll be is your friend. Though passion's your lone desire, she's the one you can't touch,. You want her so much, you're burnin', your heart's on fire. It takes a hard man to hold her, the challenge is forever on my mind. ( * Repeat)."

the rhythm of your heart,Just opened your letter. read it at least a thousand times. I looked through a teardrop. and read between the lines. A suitcase of dreams. with one left behind. I wonder out loud. if love can survive. through time and tide. And you send a message in the dark. and I feel the rhythm of your heart.

When all my illusions fall apart. there's only the rhythm of your heart
the search is over,"How can I convince you what you see is real. Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel. I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew. I took for granted the friend I have in you. I was living for a dream, loving for a moment. Taking on the world, that was just my style. Now I look into your eyes. I can see forever, the search is over. You were with me all the while. Can we last forever, will we fall apart. At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart. You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait. Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate. I was living for a dream, loving for a moment. Taking on the world, that was just my style. Now I look into your eyes. I can see forever, the search is over. You were with me all the while. Now the miles stretch out behind me. Loves that I have lost. Broken hearts lie victims of the game. Then good luck it finally struck. Like lightning from the blue. Every highway leading me back to you. Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done. The search has come full circle. Our destinies are one. So if you ever loved me. Show me that you give a damn. You'll know for certain. The man I really am. I was living for a dream, loving for a moment. Taking on the world, that was just my style. Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper. The search is over, love was right before my eyes"
too hot to sleep,"Sweat rollin' down my hands and face. Big fan on the screen porch turnin'. Cat looking for a hidin' place. Sun sinkin' but the fire's still burnin'. Music playing a few doors down,. I'm drawn to the sound. It's just too hot to sleep. I walk restless to the street cafe. See that's shakinâ€™ in the tropic zone. A cold Corona and a twist of lime. Cools me down when I'm alone. Movin' closer from across the room. I've seen her before and she looks so fine. Never wanted any woman more. I look at the door and she reads my mind. *Too hot to sleep. Give up the fight. Throw back the sheets. Shoot out the lights. Too hot to sleep. Come take me higher. Caught up in the heart. Of the moment's fire*. Still burnin' in the afterglow. Sun peekin' through mirrored glasses. A little groggy from the night before. Feelin' wired as the day advances. Can't seem to keep my mind off you. It's just no use -- it's blind desire. I wanna know that I can count on you. To throw a little gasoline on the fire. ( * Repeat)"

They're starin as I pass em by. how can they be so cold?. They're whisperin' that I'm the guy. Well I don't need to be told. Remember all the days in love. how could you run to a stranger?. Well I knew I was in danger. When it happened overnight. (* Repeat). (* Repeat). (* Repeat and fade). ."
you know who you are,"Somewhere in America one night. Out on the road I Saw her face. Trying hard to blend in with the others. She looked so out of place. Wo oh - her eyes, they caught me by surprise. They haunt my memory. Wo oh - she turned me around. Read my thoughts aloud. She moved me with a look. Then vanished in the crowd. *You know who you are. In the night youâ€™ll feel a shiver. As I touch you from afar. Shining like a star. From the world weâ€™ll keep a secret. You know who you are*. The towns all run together. As the days pour into nights and fade away. Staring at the schedule. To go back to the city and the day. Wo oh - come to me, listen to my voice. Follow what you fell. Wo oh - run to me, Iâ€™m searching for a clue. A number or a name. I'm reaching out to you. ( * Repeat). Sometimes when my heart can't find a reason. And it's just another season passing by. Wo oh - sometimes, I can close my eyes and touch you. In a moment I can feel again the way it felt that night."
youngblood,"I know what she's doin'. I saw it comin from the start. I've watched her in motion. She's aimin right for my heart. Guess I should know better. But it's hard to refuse. She's got it down to the letter. *Youngblood,. Struttin' like a school girl. Cocksure, got no doubt on her mind. She always gets what she wants. She gonna get what she needs*. Oooh, Eyes like crazy diamonds. Shinin' like a cat in the dark. The way she's put together. Always seems to tear me apart. Sneakin up behind me. She pulls me deeper under the. spell of her... ( * Repeat). She, she's not yet a woman. But she's got the power,. If you allow her. Under your skin, she's tyin' her. love to your soul. Soon she'll be takin' control. She's just a. ( * Repeat). With her youngblood, she wraps. it all around you. So tight, that I'm powerless to leave. I'm burning hot. Just get a shot of that. Youngblood, youngblood. ."
