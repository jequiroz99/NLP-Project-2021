last kiss,"Look the sun is rising I can taste the end.. Wake up my sleepwalkers it's time for you to scatter.. The kiss of death, fresh on his lips. the enemy brings his best.. Yes I will submit I'll bend before you now.. Hit me again I know who I am.. Hit me again the power is mine.. Hit me again my blood's not my own.. Where are your nails now?. Salty sweat stings my wounds. burning with the heat of your hate.. Wounded for your transgressions I lift up the weight.. I carry death to the altar. and I sacrifice myself"
unbreakable,"Where are the people that accuse me?. The ones who beat me down and bruise me. They hide, just out of sight. Can't face me in the light. They will return, but I'll be stronger. God, I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me. Sometimes it's hard to just keep going. But faith is moving without knowing. Can I trust what I can't see. to reach my destiny?. I want to take control, but I know better. God, I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me. Forget the fear, it's just a crutch. That tries to hold you back until your dreams are dust. All you need to do is just try. (Try, try, try). God, I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me. God, I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there.

for those who wait,"Another day another waiting game. A little different but it's still the same. I am here but where's the one I'm longing for. I'm having troubles feeling all alone. When my heart find a home. I want to hope but sometimes I just don't know. I know I'm not the only one. (Chorus). So you sing a lullaby. To the lonely hearts tonight. Let it set Your heart on fire. Let it set You free. When you're fighting to believe in a love that you. can't see. Just know there is a purpose. For those who wait. I want to open up my eyes. I know that I'm in need is time.

Just know there is a purpose. For those who wait. The pressure makes us stronger. The struggle makes us hunger. The hard lessons make the difference. The pressure makes us stronger. The struggle makes us hunger. The hard lessons make the difference. And the difference makes it worth it. (Chrous). So you sing a lullaby. To the lonely hearts tonight. Let it set Your heart on fire. Let it set You free. When you're fighting to believe in a love that you. can't see. Just know there is a purpose. For those who wait. Set your heart on fire. This is for those who wait"

To let my hope fade away. I need to catch myself. Open my ears to hear. You calling my name. Been fighting way too long. But I hear Your voice. You had me all along. When I'm starting to drown. You jump in to save me. When my world's upside down. Your hands. They shake me and wake me"

How can you turn your back on me when you know my pain. Stay close stay close. Light up the night. Save me from the part of me that's begging to die. Precious denial. A stone to break my back. The chains I carry won't cut me any slack. Imprisoned by fear with no room for my heart. My only hope. Only you can heal the scar. Every turn leads me to a new dead end. Lost again. I'm screaming your name. (chorus). Stay by my side. If you leave me I will die. Stay by my side. If you leave me I will die. Stay by my side. If you hold me, I will fly. If you hold me I will fly.

reflections,"In the mirror is where I find you,. longing to be free.. If only you could find truth,. who you want to be.. When I look into your eyes,. is it me you really see?. Or is it cloudy through your lies,. can I still be free?. Chorus: Open your eyes,. I see right through them.. Half-truths and lies,. Is all its ever been.. You justify,. But I'm tired of the truth.. That you don't think I know.. Sharp words find their way smooth,. slippery off your tongue.. They pour like oil from you,. but they burn in your lungs.. They never see it coming,. your sword beneath your cloak.. That darkness that you're bringing,. to the hearts that you've broke."

new perspective,"I always thought I had it figured out. No need for the benefit of the doubt. I could never look beyond what I could see. I was in control and it was all about me. I'm so sick and tired. Of this selfish life... I want more. Reach up, reach out. This house is burning down. These walls we’ve built are caving in. Reach up, don't give up. We’re standing on the ashes. With a clearer view and a new perspective. I can feel the hardness breaking up inside. Shattered by the tears falling from their eyes. I just want to push beyond the boundaries. Surrendering all control 'cause it's not about me. They’re so sick and tired. Of our selfish lives... they need more. Reach up (we know they need us). Reach out (and they’re all around us). This house is burning down. These walls we’ve built are caving in. Reach up (it’s a new beginning). Don’t give up (with the love we’re giving). We’re standing on the ashes. With a clearer view and a new perspective. We need to open up our eyes. See it written on their faces?. We are running out of time. Is there no one who will save them?. I’m reaching out"
safety (feat. stephen christian),"All alone, alone you float. Can anybody see you you're a ghost. Do they know the pain you hide. Do they know the pain you hide. Cry for help, reaching out.

You took my hand before I knew there was more than myself. Eyes opened wide, I see your face. For the first time Im not in my way. A love like I have never known. A veil is lifted, now Im not alone. Now that I know, Ive finally found my home. This life is not my own. Whatever we go through. I will follow you"

And it's the moment I've been waiting for. Been waiting to step into the future. Step into the future. Here and now. Feels like flying realizing that there's more. To this life than just surviving there is love worth dying for. But right here with You everything's changing. You change me. You change things. It's more than how you've changed things. It's how You're changing me. All I really needed was something to believe. Here and now. I'm standing at the open door. And it's the moment I've been waiting for. Been waiting to step into the future.. Step into the future. Here and now

Desperate (will You help me?). You've got me desperate.. You've got me desperate. (Oh do You see me?). Desperate (do You hear me?). Desperate (will You help me?). You've got me desperate!"
dying for your love,"I'm dark inside, it's where I hide. I lie in waiting, never changing. I'm the only one to blame. You pull me through the pain I choose. I'm calling to you, be my rescue. I'm the only one to blame. (I've betrayed) you're still waiting. (turned away) always waiting. Wherever I hide you always find me. (push and shove) you still love me. (self destruct) always love me.

easy to break,I've got a hole cut through my heart. It's broken in a million parts. But you see everything. And you don't run from me. You're shatterproof. And when I have to cry. No I don't have to hide. When I'm with you. You're not afraid to hold me. When I fall apart all over the place. You're not ashamed to love me. Even though I'm easy to break. I'm easy to break. I'm easy to break. You find me when I'm in the dark. When I fall it's into your arms. But you see everything. And you don't rum from me. You're shatterproof. And when I have to cry. No I don't have to hide. When I'm with you
escape,"My hands are tied, they're going numb. I don't know where they've brought me. My throat's torn raw from all my screams. But no one can hear me. In the dark it seems I lose my dignity. Between the pain and tears. There's only fear. Escape (we don't want to save ourselves). We will not be contained. (let's fly away with all the angels). We're breaking out tonight. Searching for a crack of light. But it seems to be changing. Is the sun leaving the sky. Or is it me that is fading. In the dark unseen. I know you search for me. I feel you drawing near. You fight my fear. Escape (we don't want to save ourselves). We will not be contained. (let's fly away with all the angels). We're breaking out tonight. Fear is not our master anymore. Run with me, escape. We're breaking out tonight. This is our time. We can't let our fear define us. This is our time. From this nightmare we're reborn. This is our time. This is our time to escape. We will not be contained. (let's fly away with all the angels). We're breaking out tonight. Fear is not our master anymore. Run with me, escape. We're breaking out tonight. You're not hopeless. You're not worthless. You are loved. Don't give up. This is your time"
fill me,"Open up the window to my mind,. a passion once was lost but now I find,. the only way to be here is with You.. Like a summer breeze I see Your ways,. the mighty trees all bow down to Your praise,. I find myself in awe at Your wondrous hand.. Chorus: I cry out to You,. use me, Lord use me.. I cry out to You,. fill me, Lord fill me.. Open up the window to my mind,. You free from sin and shame that once did bind,. me to myself and all my hurt inside.. You look upon me not with judging eyes,. but set me free like birds that fill the skies,. these chains that bind are locked up in my mind.. Bridge: Give me the words to speak,. show me someone to reach,. for Your kingdom above,. Give me the words to speak,. show me someone to reach,. someone else needs Your love."
fire in my eyes,"Feeling solid. ‘Cause I have finally got my feet on the ground. Now You rescued me, You were gravity. I was upside down, down. I've got a fire in my eyes. I'm burning brighter than the sunlight. You orchestrated my escape. Now I'm awake. I feel alive for the first time. You ignite. The fire in my eyes. Used to live my life. Locked up inside a room with no door before. You found a window, You broke it. And now I won't be contained anymore. Oh, I know You are. The reason I can breathe. Oh, I know You are. The reason I am free"
for those who wait,"Another day another waiting game. A little different but it's still the same. I am here but where's the one I'm longing for. I'm having troubles feeling all alone. When my heart find a home. I want to hope but sometimes I just don't know. I know I'm not the only one. (Chorus). So you sing a lullaby. To the lonely hearts tonight. Let it set Your heart on fire.

The struggle makes us hunger. The hard lessons make the difference. And the difference makes it worth it. (Chrous). So you sing a lullaby. To the lonely hearts tonight. Let it set Your heart on fire. Let it set You free. When you're fighting to believe in a love that you. can't see. Just know there is a purpose. For those who wait. Set your heart on fire. This is for those who wait"
forever,"Sometimes I feel so cold. Like I'm waiting. Around all by myself. Loneliness gets so old. I'm in the lost and found. Sitting on the shelf. Been stuck for way too long. But I hear Your voice. You're who I'm counting on. Oh, tell me You're here. That You. Will watch over me forever. Oh, take hold of my heart. Show me. You'll love me forever. I know that You can tell. When I start.

You jump in to save me. When my world's upside down. Your hands. They shake me and wake me"

grey,"Why do we stand here,. you and me my friend?. I see you've fallen down,. turned around again.. I watched you grow up tall,. always had your head up in the clouds.. You know I love you,. always stand by you.. But I don't get it,. why do you do it?. But I don't get it,. why do you do it?. Driving in the fast lane,. doing it all on your own.. You used to be so grounded,. how far away you have flown.. My love is yours any time or day,. but you turn and walk away from me.. You tell me to cheer up Charlie,. but I've got something to say."
he weeps,"Where is god when the rain falls. And takes the car off the road. Is he standing in the storm. Where is god when the child cries. And no one bends to pick her up. Could someone tell me what he does. He weeps, he weeps with you. He weeps with me. When I'm on my knees. And I taste defeat. He weeps, he weeps. Where is god when she won't eat. When her bones start to show. Is he there when she's lost control. Where is god when a father. Turns his back on his son. Can someone tell me what he does. He weeps, he weeps with you. He weeps with me. When I'm on my knees. And I taste defeat. He weeps, he weeps. If today's your darkest day. And you can't escape the pain. Don't be afraid. He will never walk away. He weeps, he weeps with you. He weeps with me. When you're on your knees. And you taste defeat. He weeps, he weeps. He weeps with you. He weeps with me. When you're on your knees.

here and now,Lonely moonlight guides my eyes right to the door. So many nights I'd lay here wondering will I ever cross the floor. All the dreams I held so tightly I could not stop from falling through. But right here with You everything's changing. You change me. You change things. Here and now. Never felt like this before. And it's the moment I've been waiting for. Been waiting to step into the future. Step into the future. Here and now. Feels like flying realizing that there's more. To this life than just surviving there is love worth dying for. But right here with You everything's changing. You change me. You change things. It's more than how you've changed things. It's how You're changing me. All I really needed was something to believe. Here and now. I'm standing at the open door. And it's the moment I've been waiting for. Been waiting to step into the future.. Step into the future. Here and now

last kiss,"Look the sun is rising I can taste the end.. Wake up my sleepwalkers it's time for you to scatter.. The kiss of death, fresh on his lips. the enemy brings his best.. Yes I will submit I'll bend before you now.. Hit me again I know who I am.. Hit me again the power is mine.. Hit me again my blood's not my own.. Where are your nails now?. Salty sweat stings my wounds. burning with the heat of your hate.. Wounded for your transgressions I lift up the weight.. I carry death to the altar. and I sacrifice myself"
liar,Empty prayers falling out your mouth.. Jesus said it better and he didn't have to shout.. Maybe if you change it you can get your way.. Just rearrange it and you can get paid.. A little more money comes in every day.. Faith and five dollars goes a long way.. Look at your pockets filled up with gold. But what's in your heart is making you cold.. And it's god bless you.. Because it's what you want.. And all our dreams come true.. When you get what you want.. All that i see when you start to cry.. Is the rock on your finger and gleam in your eye.. Your sad story is making me sick.. So change the channel cause it's getting thick.. Blind accusations is all you can say. But you'll say anything as long as you're paid.. Look for their weakness you feed on their need. But behind your eyes is nothing but greed.. Why do you lie to make me love you?. Is it your insecurity?. Have fun with your selfish ways and misguided thoughts. Cause you will always be...liar.
light inside,"You've been waiting, hoping you would get a chance. Is this only to give you a second glance?. Cause it won't shine a small light on you. I don't think you need a small light to prove. What's in your heart. Shine where you are. You are my star. Don't waste your time. Chasing neon lights. The light inside of you!. There's a light inside of you. It is useless to be hiding from the truth. I wish you could see yourself the way I do. Let me shine a small light for you. You shine brighter than the moon. Here, in my heart. Shine where you are.

lightning,"You put your light in up, with your electric love. You made them feel afraid. Because you're dangerous. They don't understand 'cause you're a mystery. They can't contain your energy.

look on,"This morning I sat to read the paper. The fog was lifting a little late. Each day someone was dying. And that's all I seem to notice. Lord Separate me from this mess. The world is dying its just that clear. The separation of You from us. Its killing me, its killing us. Look on. Forward to the end. Press on. Cause this time we won't be stopped. Forgiveness in You is the next hardest thing. Then giving your life for strangers. A lasting impression can fuel this move. And love will always over come. Look on. Forward to the end. Press on. Cause this time we won't be stopped. Look on. Forward to the end. Press on. Cause this time we won't be stopped. Look on. Forward to the end. Press on. Cause this time we won't be stopped"
more than a love song,"Look into her eyes. you can see shes crying out. She hides behind her smile. you can see the pain of doubt. And if you would hold her close. you could feel the brokenness inside. You would know she feels alone. She feels empty. She needs more then a hug on a holiday. She needs more then a smile on a Sunday. Shes not looking for you to fix whats wrong. She really wants to know, really wants to know she belongs. She needs more than a love song. Listen to her now. Broken is a beautiful sound. Shes a little scared. Shes afraid of falling further down. But maybe if you let her know. And gave her just a little hope. Somehow if she knew the truth shed. come alive. In the end. we will learn. actions speak louder than our words"
myself,"You turned a page, inside my heart,. Brought the light when my world was so dark. I feel something I cant explain. You consumed me and took on my shame. Everything is gone that held me down,. Your arms are around me. All the pain has left my selfish heart,. And Your love it surrounds me. You woke me up and made me learn to love more than myself. You took my hand before I knew there was more than myself. Eyes opened wide, I see your face. For the first time Im not in my way. A love like I have never known. A veil is lifted, now Im not alone. Now that I know, Ive finally found my home. This life is not my own. Whatever we go through. I will follow you"
name,"Seven days old in the ICU tonight. Little baby boy. They don’t want to have to say goodbye. Your mother’s on the phone, your father's in the hall. Praying, “God save his life”. He sees you, He’s near you. He knows your face. He knows your pain. He sees you, and He loves you. He knows your name. He knows your name. Four doors down. There’s a man who just won’t wake up. He crashed so hard. And the doctors want to pull the plug. Your wife is by your side, saying not tonight. Praying God will just show up. Maybe you're alone. In the corner of an empty house. Or maybe you're the one. No one notices in the crowd"
new perspective,"I always thought I had it figured out. No need for the benefit of the doubt. I could never look beyond what I could see. I was in control and it was all about me. I'm so sick and tired. Of this selfish life... I want more. Reach up, reach out. This house is burning down. These walls we’ve built are caving in. Reach up, don't give up. We’re standing on the ashes. With a clearer view and a new perspective. I can feel the hardness breaking up inside. Shattered by the tears falling from their eyes. I just want to push beyond the boundaries. Surrendering all control 'cause it's not about me. They’re so sick and tired. Of our selfish lives... they need more. Reach up (we know they need us). Reach out (and they’re all around us). This house is burning down. These walls we’ve built are caving in. Reach up (it’s a new beginning). Don’t give up (with the love we’re giving).

I’m reaching out"
now,"The clock is ticking. The seconds pass you by as you lie frozen. You are petrified of one more failure. A swing and a miss might break your heart in half. Yeah I know you feel alone. Don't let it break your back. Don't lay down. Don't let it destroy you. Pain is real but it's not gonna own you. Not this time around. (this is your time now). Get back up, gotta keep on trying. Raise your fist, gotta keep on fighting. This is your time now. This is your time now. Your head is spinning. The path is right before you but you're stopping. The cycle locks you in and you can't see. That you're so close to finally being free. Yeah I know, yes I know. That you can turn the key. Don't lay down. Don't let it destroy you. Pain is real but it's not gonna own you. Not this time around. (this is your time now). Get back up, gotta keep on trying. Raise your fist, gotta keep on fighting. This is your time now.

out of my head,I thought I saw the world in black and white. I guess at some point I had closed my eyes. I believed what you see is what you get. I coudn't find the faith to let you in. I guess I thought I needed evidence. I believed what you see is what you get. Time and time again I swore I'd never let you win. I can't get you out of my head. I can't get you out of my head. I can't get you out of my head. I can't get you out of my head. They say that only love can break your heart. Your love is really where the healing starts. Only you could offer proof to change my mind. Time and time again I swore I'd never let you win. I tried to shut you out and close my eyes. But you're there waiting for me in my mind. I wanna let go. Help me let go. I'm gonna let go. Giving up control
proof of our love,"So far away from the lives we lead each day.. Love as voices hunger, and there's no shelter from danger.. All this love we talk about, talking won't put food into their mouths.. Don't look away, don't look away. Why don't we do something?. Why don't we do something?. (if we say that we love them?). Don't turn away, don't turn away. Let's open up our eyes,. Bring our faith to life.. (this is proof of our love.). This is proof of our love.. Harder to see than the problems we perceive.. We're sickness, fast on our apathy and there's no way to the suffering.. All this hope we talk about, wishing won't help those who go without.. Don't look away, don't look away. Why don't we do something?. Why don't we do something?. (if we say that we love them?). Don't turn away, don't turn away. Let's open up our eyes, bring our faith to life..

prove me wrong,"Fresh tracks of tears upon my face. Trace the pain I can't erase. I shut the door and lock myself in. I try to hide the shame I feed. Bleed the source of my disease. I don't think love can go where I've been. There's just no hope that I can see. You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong. When I'm fighting for my broken heart. I tear my whole world apart. You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong. You see the me that no one does. And you show me at last I can be loved. Swallow the memories that hurt. Burn the pages and unlearn. This mask I wear I've worn for too long. You found a way through my regrets. Spread the light to guide my steps. Out of darkness to where I belong. I can't fall when you carry me. You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong. When I'm fighting for my broken heart. I tear my whole world apart. You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong. You see the me that no one does. And you show me at last I can be loved. I thought there was nothing left. I thought all my hope was dead. You brought me to life. Your love's become the air I breathe. You mean everything to me. I am finally free from the lies. You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong. When I'm fighting for my broken heart. I tear my whole world apart. You prove me wrong, you prove me wrong. You see the me that no one does. And you show me at last that I am loved"
reasons,"Tainted words,. all the while that I sit here listening,. they destroy my whole will to obey.. And they say,. that I shouldn't care I shouldn'‚t want,. to need You like I know I need You now.. Chorus: And when I turned on the reasons,. You were there watching all the while,. I should have shut down my anger,. but I was too proud.. Belly up,. sounds that only hatred could express,. found their way into my weary head.. I repent,. take away all those words I hear,. and make them go away I need Your love.. Believe me, I never thought that I would sin like this, again..

I’m tired, I need to rest. It all comes down to this. The quiet in the end. I listen for Your voice. Recovery begins. The times I hear You most. Are when You bring me close. I’ll follow as You guide. While darkness turns to light. Whisper to me, whisper to me. Whisper to me, whisper to me"
reflections,"In the mirror is where I find you,. longing to be free.. If only you could find truth,. who you want to be.. When I look into your eyes,. is it me you really see?. Or is it cloudy through your lies,. can I still be free?. Chorus: Open your eyes,. I see right through them.. Half-truths and lies,. Is all its ever been.. You justify,. But I'm tired of the truth.. That you don't think I know.. Sharp words find their way smooth,. slippery off your tongue.. They pour like oil from you,. but they burn in your lungs.. They never see it coming,. your sword beneath your cloak.. That darkness that you're bringing,. to the hearts that you've broke."
resuscitate,Find me in the shadows. Find me in the darkest night. Lost in the battle. Between wrong and right. I feel lifeless. I'm so helpless. Pull me back from the edge. Resuscitate. Bring me back to life. Resuscitate. Look into my eyes. I can see the light. I don't wanna let go. I'm fighting for my soul. Resuscitate. Bring me back to life. I feel my heart beating. Pounding inside my chest. I can hear you breathing. You're saving me from death. I feel weightless. I see heaven. Pull me back now. Pull me back from the edge
rise above,"Too much time we let pass by. Broken dreams and idle lives. Waiting on the way it ought to be. Pushing forward, falling back. Counting scars and losing track. Afraid to crash we never spread our wings. And with every chance we take we find a reason. To give up on the hope that we all need. Maybe today we all will rise. Maybe today we all will rise. Above the mistakes that we've made. Sometimes we've got to face the fall. Before we rise above it all. Can't give up on second tries. Leave the pride that blinds our eyes. No one taught us how to say goodbye. Now's the time for broken hearts. Embrace today a brand new start. Leave the past and let love lead the way. And with every chance we take we find a reason. To give up on the hope that we all need. Maybe today we all will rise. Maybe today we all will rise. Above the mistakes that we've made. Sometimes we've got to face the fall. Before we rise above it all. If we just lived like we mean it. If we loved even when we don't feel it. We would suffer for a reason. And see there is more to who we are. Maybe today we all will rise. Maybe today we all will rise. Maybe today we all will rise. Maybe today we all will rise. Above the mistakes that we've made. Sometimes we've got to face the fall. Before we rise above it all. Rise above it all. Rise above it all"
safety (feat. stephen christian),"All alone, alone you float. Can anybody see you you're a ghost. Do they know the pain you hide. Do they know the pain you hide. Cry for help, reaching out. Can anybody hear you when you shout. Are you hidden from their eyes. Are you hidden from their eyes. I see you. In the light, in the dark. I will be your bleeding heart. Cause when you need me. I'll be your safety. I'll be your safety. Like a fire, running wild. Can't contain what's deep inside. Ready to break free. I'll be your safety. I'll be your safety. House of cards, you fell apart. Feels like you were falling from the start. And now the walls are caving in. Now the walls are caving in. Take a breath, take may hand. It doesn't really matter where we land. I'll be there to help you stand. I'll be there to help you stand. I'll hold you. Your feet are gonna hit the ground. Hope is all you need right now. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there"

Power once again. So help me, God. To let this go. To let this go. So help me, God. (Become what I believe). To break this hold. (I'm afraid to leave). To find myself. (I just need to breathe).

something new,"He walks into. A crowded room. Smiles at everyone he sees. Another night. Pretending hes alright. Cant find what he really needs. Hes looking for. Something more. Something new. To heal his broken heart. Hes looking for. Someone who. Who can understand. She sees him there. Tries not to stare. But something stirs her deep inside. Shell recognize. Something in his eyes. Fight the urge to run and hide. And all the while. Shes looking for. They thought that they were lost,. But theyve been on their way. To the place where love would find them. Its time to let go of all the pain theyve known. and leave the past behind them. What is it that has brought them here. With faith it can become so clear"
stand up,Look at all. The lonely hearts. Shivering out in the dark. Hiding from the truth. Cover up the proof. Demons. That I've tried to hide. Imprison me in my own lies. And all that I can do is. Cover up the proof. Don't be afraid to. Stand up. Stand up. If you're broken. Stand up. Stand up. If you feel ashamed. You are not alone. When you hurt this way. Stand up. Stand up. If you need love. Stand up. This is not judgment day. You don't have to hide. There's no need to run. Everything will be okay. Secrets. Got me torn apart. Trying to destroy my heart. But I can see the light. It's cutting. Through the night. Don't run away. (Don't run away). Don't be afraid to. You say You love me. That's all I'll ever need. If You say I'm good enough. That's good enough for me

stay close,"I wanna know you. There's so much at stake. Can't face the melodies. They bend me until I break. Hiding from the past. But its eating me alive. Can't block it out when it's comin' from inside. Every turn leads me to a new dead end. Lost again. I'm screaming your name. Come close come close. And call my name. How can you turn your back on me when you know my pain. Stay close stay close. Light up the night. Save me from the part of me that's begging to die. Precious denial. A stone to break my back.

I'm screaming your name. (chorus). Stay by my side. If you leave me I will die. Stay by my side. If you leave me I will die. Stay by my side. If you hold me, I will fly. If you hold me I will fly.

the fallout,"Rushing out the house while it's burning down. Running through the door trying to make it out. Ashes fill the sky, you're left chose inside. Leaving everything that you know behind. See you fall apart right before your eyes. Tears run down your face, everything's erased. Oh, oh oh oh oh oh. Oh, oh oh oh oh oh. Black heart beat. This is the fallout, this is the breakdown. What are you fighting for?. Give all that you've, got down to the last drop. What are you fighting for?. Standing in the fallout. Picking up the pieces with broken hands. Put it back together, however, you can. Left you high and dry, you're done asking why. Never going back to what used to be. Never gonna repeat that history. Lay it all to rest. Get it off of your chest"
the hunger,"Cut it out, cut it out. I know it's what. You're wanting to say. Burning up, burning up. I know why. You're feeling this way. There's an ache. You can't erase. A yearning. That you can't replace. And you want Him. And you need Him. But you act. Like He's not there. Yeah, you know. That you're hollow. And something's. Missing here. So you push. And you pull. The hole in your soul. But you can't make. The hunger disappear. You got a rusted out. Lock on your door. Getting ready to break. You've held back. Love long enough. I think it's time to cave. You're waiting for a sign. The fact is faith is blind. Do you want to spend. Your whole life jaded?. Stuck in a rut. That you created. Why don't you. Break the cycle?. Let love win"
the love we had before,I burnt the bridge. That you were building. But I left here. Feeling guilty. That we couldn't see. Eye to eye. Why can't we compromise?. Why are we choosing sides?. When will we realize?. We don't have. To fight anymore. Where is the love. We had before?. Wouldn't the world. Be better. Off if we decide?. We don't need. Our pride anymore. Where is the love. We had before?. Where is the love. Where is the love. Where is the love. The love we had before. You used to be. The one I'd run to. But now I tend to run you. Right into the ground. Sorry I was such a fool. Never saw your point of view. Can we start over somehow?. Yu know. We only hurt ourselves. When we don't communicate. Why can't we stop. And make a change?. Where is the love?. Where is the love?
this is our time,"You can't shake it, shake the feeling that there's more. More to life than what you know. There's a whisper. Hear it screaming, can't ignore it. Something you cannot control. There is no hesitating. There is no time for waiting. We never stop we only go. It starts tonight. We are alive. This is our time. This is out time. At the speed of night. Nothing left to hide. This is our time. This is our time. Do you hear it, hear it calling like. A siren that will never let you go. Do you feel it, feel it tugging at your heart. It's the voice that calls you home. There is no hesitating. There is no time for waiting. We never stop we only go"
touch the sky,"Let me love, let me love, love them for You.. May I be, may I be, may I be true.. Can I find, can I find, can I find You,. and show them who You are.. You're the One, You're the One, One I turn to.. Want to be, want to be, want to be true.. Nothing left, nothing left, left to prove,. But show them who You are.. Chorus: I live for You,. there's nothing You cannot do.. You lift me up high,. You spread my wings to touch the sky.. You are there, You are there, when I'm against the wall,. You can make the mighty, mighty, mighty fall.. You're the One, the One, the One who made it all,. I see you every where.. You're the One, the One who made the blind to see,.

unbreakable,"Where are the people that accuse me?. The ones who beat me down and bruise me. They hide, just out of sight. Can't face me in the light. They will return, but I'll be stronger. God, I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me. Sometimes it's hard to just keep going. But faith is moving without knowing. Can I trust what I can't see. to reach my destiny?. I want to take control, but I know better. God, I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me. Forget the fear, it's just a crutch. That tries to hold you back until your dreams are dust. All you need to do is just try. (Try, try, try). God, I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me. God, I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me"
voluntary blindfold,"Amidst the war cries on the day of battle,. blown by violent winds on this stormy day.. Shall I offer the fruit of my body,. for the sin of my soul?. Chorus: For we have made a lie our refuge,. and a falsehood our hiding place.. For Lord we've turned from You,. to serve idols.. Lord forgive us for our rage.. Following our own paths we've strayed from You,. and now our eyes no longer seek Your face.. We've torn down our supports and pushed away our ladder,. and now our hearts have grown so cold.. Humbly now we come before you on our knees,. longing for a drink of Your living water.. You wash our face and erase all of our darkness,. and now we'll only live for You."
waiting,"God protect me from myself. I search for life finding death. God heal me. My broken heart it longs for You. (Chorus). I'm waiting, I'm waiting,. To hear You call my name. I'm waiting, I'm waiting. For You Lord. And I'm ready, for you to draw me near. It's always been this way with you. But that's what makes you dear. (Chorus). I'm waiting, I'm waiting,. To hear You call my name. I'm waiting, I'm waiting. For You Lord. (Bridge). Oh Lord You know my heart. (Chorus). I'm waiting, I'm waiting,. To hear You call my name. I'm waiting, I'm waiting. For You Lord. I'm waiting, I'm waiting,. To hear You call my name. Fixated, I'm waiting. For You Lord"
we are alive,"Standing here under heaven's light. I do believe. I take hold of this precious time. Given to me. Catch the moment and take it in. This is the dream. You and I we were born for this. Here now we're free. Ch. We're feeling good tonight. Can't keep it all inside. We are alive. We're shining like the stars. Just being who we are. We are alive. Share the love, give all that you can. Your heart is full. Let it rain like a waterfall. Unstoppable. . Nothing can stop us now. Nothing can slow us down. We're feeling so alive"
what i've overcome,I’ve got this passion. It’s something I can’t describe. It’s so electric. It’s like I’ve just come alive. I feel this freedom. Now that my past is erased. I feel the healing. I found the meaning of grace. (I found grace). If only you could see me yesterday. Who I used to be before the change. You’d see a broken heart. You’d see the battle scars. It’s funny how words can’t explain. How good it feels to finally break the chains. I’m not what I have done. I’m what I’ve overcome. I know I’ll stumble. I know I’ll still face defeat. These second chances will define me. So I’m moving forward. I’m standing on my two feet. I’ve got momentum. I’ve got someone saving me. (Got someone saving me). I’ll make mistakes and I might fall. But I won’t break. I’ve got someone saving me
wrapped in your arms,"Is this the whole picture. Or is it just the start?. Is this the way you love me?. You're capturing my heart. I used to try and walk alone. But I've begun to grow. And when you tell me just to rest. I'm finally letting go. I let go. And I'm here to stay. Nothing can separate us. And I know, I'm ok. You cradle me gently. Wrapped in your arms.... I'm home. I'm seeing so much clearer. Looking through your eyes. I could never find a safer place. Even if I tried. All the times I've needed you. You've never left my side. I'm clinging to your every word. Don't ever let me go. Don't let go"
you decide,"Fiction and reality collide. Faceless and so busted up inside. You've been searching, you've been crying out,. Will you be destroyed by all your doubt?. You decide. (Who will you run to). Wrong or right. (there is no reason). For you to hide. Only love can change your life. You decide. God is calling out to you again. Let Him pull you, let Him take you in. From the fear that swallows up you life. Will you stay the same or will you fight?. You decide. (Who will you run to). Wrong or right. (there is no reason). For you to hide. Only love can change your life. Only love can change your life. Every day you hold on to your lonely broken heart. It's tearing you apart. God is calling out to you just let healing star. Will you open up and let Him in?. You decide. (Who will you run to). Wrong or right. (there is no reason). For you to hide. Only love can change your life. You decide. You decide"
you gave me a promise,"The waves are crashing down on me. But I know that this cannot be the end, be the end.... Right now I feel like copping out. Will You hold me up, if I just say. That I will stay. I will hold on to this hope that I have. You gave me a promise. You gave me a promise. I'll push through this moment, I'll never give up. You gave me a promise. You gave me a promise. I'm so tired that I can't stand. But I know that time will heal this heart,. Heal this heart.... With every door that's slamming shut. A new one's there to lead me where You are. You, You call out to me. You're just out of reach. But I'm closing in. I'm still going, still believing in Your word"
you give me that feeling,"How many words are there to say?. But I still can’t find a way. To tell you how you’ve captured me. And turned it all around. I want to write it down. I need to say it out loud. This force inside is driving me. And I can’t hold it in. I know You’re the only one. Who could help me finally open up. You created something new in me. You give me that feeling. A power I can believe in. The world around me disappears. (I know I'm completely changed). You give me that feeling. I could smash straight through the ceiling. Fly until I reach the sun. (The ties that bind me come undone). You give me that feeling. Your light, it shines so bright. It makes the day seem like the night. You chase away the shadows. And illuminate my path. I know You’re the only one. Who could help me finally open up. You created something new in me. I always thought if someone knew the real me. They would turn away. But now I’ve found Your love completes me. And I’ll never be the same"
