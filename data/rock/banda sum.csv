fly away,I know it gets so crazy in this town. It feels like you're being pushed. From all around. Yeah I know sometimes. Life can drag you down. But trust me when I say it's gonna end. Tomorrow another day is gonna start again. If you keep dreaming on. The pain will be gone. Just hold my hand. And give one chance. To let it go. We could make it glow. We could fly away. And leave this place behind. We could fly away. And leave this place behind. When everybody is talking but you're silent. Pretending that you're laughing. But inside you're crying. You could come with me. And fly away from here. And then your days are gonna be. Much brighter than they did. You're going to be so high you cannot feel the. Ground that is right beneath your feet. You cannot feel the ground. That is right beneath your feet. Just hold my hand. And give one chance. To let it go. We could make it glow. We could fly away. And leave this place behind. We could fly away. And leave this place behind. In the darkest night. Like a shoot across the sky. I'll be there for you. To make your own light shine. Give you reasons to smile. I'll be there for you. In the darkest night. Like a shoot across the sky. I'll be there for you. To make your own light shine. Give you reasons to smile. I ll be there for you
