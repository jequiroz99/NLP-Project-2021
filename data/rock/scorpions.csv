wind of change,"I follow the Moskva. Down to Gorky Park. Listening to the wind of change. An August summer night. Soldiers passing by. Listening to the wind of change. The world is closing in. Did you ever think. That we could be so close, like brothers. The future's in the air. I can feel it everywhere. Blowing with the wind of change. [Chorus:]. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change. Walking down the street. And distant memories. Are buried in the past forever. I follow the Moskva. Down to Gorky Park. Listening to the wind of change. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams. With you and me. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change. The wind of change blows straight. Into the face of time. Like a stormwind that will ring. The freedom bell for peace of mind. Let your balalaika sing. What my guitar wants to say. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams. With you and me. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change"

under the same sun,"I saw the morning. It was shattered by a gun. Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried. I saw a mother. She was praying for her son. Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die. Do you ever ask yourself. Is there a Heaven in the sky. Why can't we get it right. 'cause we all live under the same sun. We all walk under the same moon. Then why, why can't we live as one. I saw the evening. Fading shadows one by one. We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice. I saw the children. The children of the sun. How they wept, how they bled, how they died. Do you ever ask yourself. Is there a Heaven in the sky. Why can't we stop the fight. 'cause we all live under the same sun. We all walk under the same moon. Then why, why can't we live as one. Sometimes I think I'm going mad. We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care. But in my heart it doesn't change. We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love. And does it really matter. If there's a heaven up above. We sure could use some love. 'Cause we all live under the same sky. We all look up at the same stars. Then why, why can't we live as one?. 'Cause we all live under the same sun. We all walk under the same moon. We all live under the same sky. We all look up at the same stars. Then why, tell me why can't we live as one?"
life is too short,Have you ever seen the morning. When the sun comes up the shore. And the silence makes. A beautiful sound. Have you ever sat there waiting. For the time to stand still. For all the world to stop. From turning around. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. Have you ever seen the glowing. When the moon is on the rise. And the dreams are close. To the ones that we love. Have you ever sat there waiting. For heaven to give a sign. So we could find the place. Where angels come from. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. There's a time that turns. I'd turn back time. But I don't say I can. It only works if you believe in the truth. Well there's a time to live. And a time to cry. But if you're by my side. I will try to catch a star. I'll try to catch a star. Just for you. And I run. 'Cause life is too short. And I run. 'Cause life is too short. And I run. 'Cause life is too short. And I run. 'Cause life is too short. Too short. Too short. Life is too short. Too short. Too short. Life is too short.

house of cards,"Sometimes I walk mysterious places. Hear voices that talk without a word to say. Sometimes I hear the echoes of laughter. In the twilight of affairs and other tragedies. A half-moon away, way too close to heaven. She had the iook, but no morality. Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment. But there are nights you regret eternally. Whatever frozen hearts can do. Will melt the ice away. How you know what it's like. When good luck has changed the sides. And no sun shines in the dark and no angels. Ever hear your prayers in the night. When your fears come up your spine. When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart. When you get crushed in a house of cards. House of cards. It's so hard to find a way when life is in pieces. And the taste of a kiss is so bittersweet. Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment. But the man who'll rise up from. The ashes is no one else but me. L'm standing in a waterfall. To wash the lies away. How you know what it's like. When good luck has changed the sides. And no sun shines in the dark and no angels. Ever hear your prayers in the night. When your fears come up your spine. When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart. House of cards. Whatever frozen hearts can do. Will melt the ice away. How you know what it's like. When good luck has changed the sides. And no sun shines in the dark. And no angels. Ever hear your prayers in the night. When your fears come up your spine. When your life turns upside down. And there is no one. You get crushed in a house of cards. House of cards"
we built this house,"Love is the glue that hold us together. Faith and believing is the key, this door of forever. Baby you and I, we're every reason on earth. Now and again, it's always us. Against the world, against the world. When the rain fell. And the flood came. And the wind blew hot. Like a hammer on these walls. We didn't crack or break or fall. We built this house on a rock. This house on a rock. And there is a time to face stormy weather. But we are always standing strong, a lifetime together. Baby you and I, we don't regret anything. Now it's the two of us again. Against the wind, against the wind. When the rain fell. And the flood came. And the wind blew hot. Like a hammer on these walls. We didn't crack or break or fall. We built this house on a rock. This house on a rock. Brick by brick, we have set it up. Oh men, if this walls could talk. Bit by bit, based it on trust. We gave it all we got. When the rain fell. And the flood came. And the wind blew hot. Like a hammer on these walls. We didn't crack or break or fall. We built this house on a rock. This house on a rock. We built this house on a rock. This house on a rock"
10 light years away,"In a run down bed and breakfast. A room with a view, across the river. I tried to loose the claustrophobia. Opened up and find Utopia, Utopia. There's no more denying. As my mind go flying. 10 light years away to save my soul. 10 light years away to change it all. Whatever it may take I gotta try again. Girl it's time to start over. 10 light years away. I'd been watching the reflection. Of a bamboo in the shade, when I saw her. A very hot day in Havana. In a midnight blue lagoon. So shiny and exciting. I knew she was hiding. 10 light years away so take me home. 10 light years away where I come from. Help me find today it's been way too long. Girl it's time to start over. 10 light years away. There's no more denying. As my mind go flying. 10 light years away to save my soul. 10 light years away to change it all. Whatever it may take I gotta try again. Girl it's time to start over. 10 light years away so take me home. 10 light years away where I come from. Help me find today It's been way too long.

a moment in a million years,"Music : Klaus Meine. Lyrics: Klaus Meine. The lights are slowly fading down. There's no one else, just you and me. Nothing ever changed. I see your faces in the crowd. It seems I know each one of you. For all my life. I wish this night could last forever. But it's time to go. I saw you laugh, I saw you cry. All for one and one for all. Nothing ever changed. The way you sang just blew my mind. It gave me chills from head to toe. What a glorious night. To me it could have lasted forever. But it's time to go. A moment in a million years. Is all I've got for you. A moment in a million years. To make some dreams come true. A moment that I won't forget. Until the day I die. A moment in a million years. Called life. The bus is waiting right outside. To hit the road and once again. I leave you all behind. I chase another dream tonight. And by the time you'll be home. I'll be far away. Nothing seems to last forever. It's time to go. A moment in a million years. Is all I've got for you. A moment in a million years. To make some dreams come true. A moment that I won't forget. Until the day I die. A moment in a million years."
across the universe,"Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,. They slither while they pass they slip away across the universe.. Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind,. Possessing and caressing me.. Jai guru deva, Om.. Nothing's gonna change my world,. Nothing's gonna change my world,. Nothing's gonna change my world,. Nothing's gonna change my world.. Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,. They call me on and on across the universe.. Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box,. They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe. Jai guru deva, Om.. Nothing's gonna change my world,.

aleyah,"Music : Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker. The easy way. Is not the way my life will take. Because the limit is the sky. The easy way. Is not the way that I can take. My life's in pieces half the time. Dancing on a razor blade. Break the ice but never break. Where the time meets destiny. Take your chance and come with me. Aleyah. The easy way. Is not the way that I can take. I keep on dancing in the sky. It's the way. And not the goal that will make it. All so special in my life. Dancing on the pulse of time. Bring it home across the line. Come with me. Aleyah. Dancing on a razor blade. Break the ice but never break. Where the time meets destiny. Take your chance and come with me. Aleyah. Life in the fast lane. Don't you think baby. To make it up there."
alien nation,"Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. In the heat of the violence. The night's exploding everywhere. When hate pulls the trigger. The devil comes to take his share. In the garden of Eden. The time is running out so fast. Into heart of the demon. With no escape our die is cast. In the city of angels. Death is just a moment away. In the city of angels. Your future won't see the light of the day. Beware of the alien nation. Beware of the truth that they seek. They pray for eternal salvation. They pray for your soul to keep. On the eve of destruction. A reign of terror rules the street. When the heads start rolling. The devil comes to let it bleed. In the city of angels. Death is just a moment away. In the city of angels. Your future won't see the light of the day. Walk on past the alien nation. Walk on to the end of your reach. No fear of the alien nation. No fear of the hatred they preach. Don't run, there's no place to hide. Today or tomorrow it will get you. Don't move, the knife is right at your throat. And whatever you do, there's no way out. When the shroud comes down on this place. To bury us all alive. We'll know the time has come, to face the heat. Beware of the alien nation. Beware of the truth that they seek. They pray for eternal salvation. They pray for your soul to keep. Walk on past the alien nation. Walk on to the end of your reach. They pray for eternal damnation. They pray for your soul to keep"

It's great to be here to see you all. I know, for me it is like. Coming home. Like coming home..."

crazy ride,"A nameless band back in '65. It feels like yesterday. I met some friends and went for a ride. To rock the nights away. The sixties revolution. Just caught me on the spot. That Rock 'n' Roll infusion. Stayed always in my blood. It's been a long, long road. Ifs been a crazy ride. From mother earth to mars. We walked the extra mile. A crazy ride. It's been a crazy ride. Sometimes the world was not enough. No place too far away. We keep on running until we drop. Forever and a day. My one and only passion. That haunts me night and day. This Rock 'n' Roll obsession. Won't ever fade away"

Build it up in your backyard. I'm so sick of it all. Ooh, it's a crazy world. Ooh, it's a crazy world. Drivin' down to the city. Doin' 155. Better late than never. I'm more dead than alive.

We all live (In a crazy, crazy world). Ooh yeah (It's a crazy, crazy world). I gotta get out (Of this crazy, crazy world). Goin' home to my baby. It's been another hard day.

crossfire,It seems to me a nightmare becomes reality. The last days of the paradise are gone for you and me. We're living in the crossfire. And we'll be killed at first. Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world. Understand that we don't wanna fight. Understand that we are much too young to die. Understand no one will survive. Understand that we love our life. Can I trust the meaning of the life line in my hand. Which is as long as exciting hundred years. I could be a lucky man. But I'm living in the crossfire. Of a time that starts to burn. Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world. Understand that we don't wanna fight. Understand that we are mush too young to die. Understand no one will survive
crying days,"Force yourself to use your brain,. The only way to gain,. A lot of things are just a lie. This world we love comes down in pain. With hate and bloody games. A question-mark up in the sky. Look, you can't keep away. And you can't hide. Tomorrow, yesterday, today.... Some people say, we'll do it better. Some people say, everything's good. Some people sing, let's come together. But nobody has ever brought it through. Maybe you and me...."

dancing with the moonlight,"Rock the place, getting on the plane. A lightning on the way. The cabin crew told us to relax, yeah. Time for a birthday bash. And threw a party and we all crash. Long before we were taking off to nowhere. Dancing with the moonlight. Should have been an easy flight. But once in the air and we went down. Dancing with the moonlight. Destination out of sight. And before we arrived. We went back on the ground. We're getting this up and refuelling the plane. It's like and cheap champagne. Looking so much better. Back in the air. We were finally on our way. One hour flight but this one took forever. Dancing with the moonlight. Should have been an easy flight. But once in the air and we went down. Dancing with the moonlight. Destination out of sight.

Dancing with the moonlight. Destination out of sight. And before we arrived. We went back on the ground"

You wanna go, but you can never leave. She's cool inside. She drives me wild. So cool inside. She drives me wild. If she comes, and that's for sure. It just can't get any better anymore. Here she comes, now give me more. Don't ever stop!. Stop, baby!. Don't go away!. She's like a stone that's coming over me. That fever grows to pure insanity. She's cool inside. She drives me wild. So cool inside. She drives me wild"

evening wind,A summer day is gone. Listen to the evening wind. Singing tunes of tamarind. Into the setting sun. You lie in twilight sleep. Dreaming colors deep. Today all life is gone. Look at the golden chalice. Flag broken on the ground. Ringing fire blazing round. Where are your friends. You see all hope. Lying broken on a slope. Today all life is gone. Have you ever listened to the evening wind. To the gentle breeze and its truth. Have a listen and you will see my friends. Wind is telling you the truth
"every minute, every day","Well it seems that I was lost. In intoxicated nights. Following the trace of ecstasy. With no future and no past. Just the present was alive. Like a prisoner chained on to a dream. I was drowning in a feeling. That obsession rules. 'till the morning kills the creatures of the night. And I read your lipstick message. On the mirror of the truth. Now that you're gone I realize. Without you. Life's like a song without music. Without you. This world won't be the same. I need your love, every minute. I need your love, every day. I need your love, every minute. I need your love, come back and stay. Well I know that I was lost. In the nightmare of my life. Following the flash of fantasy. In a feeling that exploded. I'd left reality behind. Addicted to the power of a dream. Without you. Life's like that road that leads nowhere. Without you. The world won't feel the same. I need your love, every minute. I need your love, every day. I need your love, every minute"
eye of the storm,"Another year is running through my veins. Some moments wasted, some will remain. The days are getting shorter and I try to drown my fears. The shadows of the night slowly disappear. Another day to leave it all behind. Good morning life, so beautiful and bright. I'm going back in time to the days when I was young. And now it feels like life had just begun. I'm on my way home, on my way home. Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago. I'm on my way home sending postcards home. Greetings from the eye of the storm. Another night, the curtain's coming down. I hear the silence just screaming loud. I can see the sunrise rising from the smoke. Will you be there for me, will I ever know. I'm on my way home, on my way home. Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago. I'm on my way home sending postcards home. Greetings from the eye of the storm. Rock the highway, highway star. And bring me back, just bring me back to my iove. I'm on my way home, on my way home. Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago. I'm on my way home feelin' high and low.

eye to eye,"A live begins another's over. As another day begins. Life runs full circle getting older. It happens to me. It happens to you. I do believe you're still around me. You're still around me all the time. I have no doubt one day in heaven. I will see you again. I'll see you again, see you again. Break the bread, drink the wine. In my heart you'll live forever. The time to go is never right. When we say goodbye. While we're here we shouldn't waste. A day in life to say I love you. It's now that I'd just wish so much, to see you. Eye to eye. When you came home the war was over. So many years before my time. I was so proud the day you told me. You haven't hurt anyone. No one. Break the bread, drink the wine. In my heart you'll live forever. The time to go is never right. When we say goodbye. While we're here we shouldn't waste. A day in life to say I love you. It's now that I'd just wish so much, to see you. Eye to eye"

So many ways, so many ways. Flying through the sky forever. into another time. Yesterday so far away. Many miles together. Were looking for a way. Day by day. So far away. All the world. To do the same. So we go together. Will you show me the way. Time has gone. It has gone. Far away, far away. And today. I'll see a way. Follow me we love you. Just listen, what I say. Forget your name and yesterday. Put out your hand. I'll do the same. Now were going to another land. Will you show me the way. Time has gone. It has gone far away. Far away."

fly to the rainbow,"Life is empty, can't remember anytime before,. On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore,. Gliding through this life, and another is a child,. and we're doing games, and losing things,. Always playing gigs.. Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright,. Where the sun is shining, in the night.. I am in disgrace, yet I see a smiling face,. and I hope you let me, share your place.. I don't live today.. Rain in the sky, make the world fly,. Into time, beg me your time.. Sun in the sky, make the world fly,. Into time, beg me your time.. Rain in the sky, make the world fly,. Into time, beg me your time.. Sun in the sky, make the world fly,. Into time, beg me your time.. Rain in the sky, make the world fly,. Into time, beg me your time.. Sun in the sky, make the world fly,. Into time, beg me your time.. I lived in magic solitude,. With cloudy looking mountains,. The lake made out of crystal raindrops.. Run through space, 2000 years ago,. I've seen the giant city of Atlantis,. sinking into an eternal wave of darkness.. Shhh.. Somewhere in the blue distance,. Are those long forgotten trees of gold. Broken lives hidden down in the sand. Darkness everywhere, nothing. Symbols, strange symbols on a cold leaf. Painting torrid colours all sky green.. Candle painted white like the moon,. Faraway children bleed, God save them.. Drifting garish ghosts like shadows.. Save break to catch and kill time.. Echoes one round endless meadow.. To call the Thing...Sublime!..."
follow your heart,"Have you ever climbed the mountain?. Have you ever crossed the sea?. Take a look around the corner. And listen to your heartbeat. Have you ever touched the rainbow?. Take a ride on a ferris wheel. Take one step to start a journey. It's up to you. To make it real. This is the time for yourself to be free. You gotta follow your heart. This is the time in your life. And It's never too late. To see the light in the dark. You gotta follow your heart. Walking far away horizons. You'll never walk alone. To be at home When your heart is. A million miles away from home. This is the time for yourself to be free. You gotta follow your heart. This is the time in your life. And It's never too late. To see the light in the dark. You gotta follow your heart. . Show me the way. Who knows the way. This is the only road to go. Life brings me down. Life takes me up. And Only, Only heaven knows. This is the time for yourself to be free. You gotta follow your heart. This is the time in your life. And It's never too late. To see the light in the dark. You gotta follow your heart. You gotta follow your heart"
freshly squeezed,"Music : Rudolf Schenker, Peter Wolf. Lyrics: Klaus Meine. A G-string is looking for a pilot. White flesh is coming down the stairs again. Your look just makes me a believer. Stray cats are landing in a rain storm. Crashed down lost in wango tango land. Spaced out your body gives me fever. You sex it. Relax it. Reload it. You want it freshly squeezed. Closed down the road of all restrictions. Mad dogs are tearing down the roof again. Sweet noise is pouring from the speakers. Last dance I'm drowning in the moonlight. Exit is the door that I can't find. Black out it can't get it any deeper. You sex it. Relax it. Reload it. And never hold it. You slash it. Refresh it. Reload it. You want it fresh. Got no diamonds rings. But a song to sing. Just to make you fly. Beggar or a king."
going out with a bang,"If you say we're falling. It's gonna be on our feet. We're gonna take it to town. We'll ride the dark side of the street. If you think we're not fighting. Like we used to do. So are you ready for this. You might learn a bit a trick or two. 'Cause all those years of rockin' hard. Have taught us how to rise and how to fall. We're still standing tall. We're going out with a bang. We're going out with a bang. I said we gonna go out with a bang. Bang, bang, bang. Out with a bang. If you say we're losing. Watch out we're taking the crown. Thumbs go up all the way. No sign of slowing down. If you think we're excited. I cannot tell you how much. 'Cause life's a heartbeat away. And we're never losing touch. 'Cause all those years of rockin' hard. Have taught us how to rise and how to fall. We're standing tall"
gypsy life,"Here I go again. Feels like once upon a time. But this is here and now. You can try to read my mind. Well, life has given me so much. And so much more. True love is hard to find. When you're on the run. While all those years go by. The clock is ticking way too fast. And I just ask myself. What is going to be last. I've seen it all, but still. I've seen nothing yet at all. So I'm still looking for. Some diamonds and pearls. Bye-bye, girl. There's a road I gotta find. Called the gypsy life. I miss that life. Like a good old friend. Well, friends they come and go. Some are here and some are gone. And when the sun goes down. I will walk this road alone. But now I'm here with you. And my heart is full of hope. That life will bring me back. Into your open arms. Bye-bye, girl. There's a road I gotta find. Called the gypsy life. I miss that life. Like a good old friend. Bye-bye, girl. There's a dream that's still alive. It will take some time. A long, long time. Until I'm back again"

he's a woman - she's a man,"I saw it walkin' lonely down the street. Cool like a cat, like crazy clean. I looked twice again, I can't believe. Oh no no no. It turned around right then. And looked at me. I said oh no, it really couldn't be. It was a man, it was a woman, too. He's a woman, she's a man. He's a woman, she's a - woman -. I think it really came from far away. I'm feeling hypnotized, I have to stay. It takes my hand and says come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. We're goin' home, it's nice and warm to say. He starts to move, she starts to play.

An' you also know that she's a liar. Knowing only her desire...."

hit between the eyes,"Late at night when you're all alone. Take a ride to the danger zone. If someone wants to cut you down to size. You never argue with a loaded .45. Just when you've had enough. It's really getting tough. I'm ready for that hit between the eyes. Someone get me out of here alive. I'm ready for that hit between the eyes. Can't you see I'm much too young to die.

hour 1,"So here we are. It's hour one. And it's a nightmare. There's nothing left. And yet it's good to be alive. There's no use crying. Cause the universe is not fair. The wicked and the innocent. Are fighting to survive. Child stay down, stay down. You better run for cover underground. Child stay down, stay down. You better shut your mouth. Don't make a sound. Human nature is the reason. For our downfall. And we deserve it playing God. With our machines. Our religions are a prison. That's our fatal flaw. Bombs are flying. While we're sleeping with the enemy. Child stay down, stay down. You better run for cover underground. Child stay down, stay down. You better shut your mouth. Don't make a sound. Look at me, right at me. When I'm telling you to stay down. Come to me, run to me. I am begging you to stay down. Cling to me desperately. All you gotta do is stay down. Pay attention my child down. Look at me, right at me. When I'm telling you to stay down. Come to me, run to me. I am begging you to stay down. Cling to me desperately. All you gotta do is stay down. Pay attention my child. Child, stay down, stay down. You better run for cover underground. Child stay down, stay down. You better shut your mouth. Don't make a sound. Child, stay down, stay down. You better run for cover underground. Child stay down, stay down. Stay down. . By:Kléber ""Wolfboy"" Moreira ""Iceman"""
house of cards,"Sometimes I walk mysterious places. Hear voices that talk without a word to say. Sometimes I hear the echoes of laughter. In the twilight of affairs and other tragedies. A half-moon away, way too close to heaven. She had the iook, but no morality. Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment. But there are nights you regret eternally. Whatever frozen hearts can do. Will melt the ice away. How you know what it's like. When good luck has changed the sides. And no sun shines in the dark and no angels. Ever hear your prayers in the night. When your fears come up your spine. When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart. When you get crushed in a house of cards. House of cards. It's so hard to find a way when life is in pieces. And the taste of a kiss is so bittersweet. Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment. But the man who'll rise up from. The ashes is no one else but me. L'm standing in a waterfall. To wash the lies away. How you know what it's like. When good luck has changed the sides. And no sun shines in the dark and no angels. Ever hear your prayers in the night. When your fears come up your spine. When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart. House of cards. Whatever frozen hearts can do. Will melt the ice away. How you know what it's like. When good luck has changed the sides. And no sun shines in the dark. And no angels. Ever hear your prayers in the night. When your fears come up your spine. When your life turns upside down. And there is no one. You get crushed in a house of cards. House of cards"

You sold your soul to feed your maladies. Your fantasies and lies. You are a drop in the rain. Just a number not a name. If you don't see it. You don't believe it. At the end of the day.

You are a needle in the hay. You signed and sealed it. And now you gotta deal with it. Humanity. Humanity. Goodbye. Run and hide. There's fire in the sky. Stay inside. The water is gonna rise and put you under. In your eyes. I'm staring at the end of time. Nothing can change us. No one can save us from ourselves. You are a drop in the rain. Just a number not a name. If you don't see it. You don't believe it. At the end of the day. You are a needle in the hay. You signed and sealed it. And now you gotta deal with it. Humanity. Humanity.

i wanted to cry (but the tears wouldn't come),"Well here comes my baby. She's dressed oh so cute. She looks a little crazy. In her Hollywood shoes. Well baby loves driving. In my hot brand new car.

Well she's a lucky lady. Born in a Gucci store. With gold cards in motion. And the platinum too. She jets across the ocean. A little faster than you. But when it rains in St. Barth.

Ohh, so I keep waiting, I keep waiting. I swear.... I never let you go again. Well here comes my baby. With a Brad Pitt lookalike. Right through immigration. And straight out of my life. Well it seems the friendly skies. Are pretty good fun. I wanted to cry. But the tears wouldn't come. I wanted to cry.... I wanted to cry.... I wanted to cry.... But the tears wouldn't come"

I take too much in the Saturday night. Hey... Hey. Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling. I'm in a trance. I wanna try to stop this life. I'm in a trance. Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling. I'm in a trance. I take too much in the Saturday night. Hey...Hey. Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling. I'm in a trance. I wanna try to stop this life
in your park,"In the night there is. A gentle voice of silence. So low and quiet. She'll catch me 'cos I've been longing.. I want to walk in your park. Cos I'm alone,. I want to walk in your heart. Where are you? I don't know.... I look around and see. The sunshine in the morning.. - Shadows in the night like angels by your side in the alley... -. On my journey I change the time,. Leave everything behind me.. - Shadows in the night like angels by your side in the alley... -. I want to walk in your park. Cos I'm alone,. I want to walk in your heart. Where are you? I don't know.... Let me walk, let me walk in your heart!."

Give your money, oh. Obligator came and said to me. Why don't you pay your debt. The debt that you amend. Asking him forgive on his demand. For I am with a mate. Despite in her return. Remittance of the debt. I can't accept. He told me and he capped. Quite time on his demand. Imaginations came into my brain. Cause if you patients came. That brings me in my break. Test the mend, devil mend. Bloody money when it's lent. Scum repair everywhere. They want money, oh."
is there anybody there?,Open my mind let me find new vibrations. Tell me the way I must take to reach my destination. And a place where I can stay. Where is the love of my life couldn't find her. Show me the way to find myself. 'Cause I'm nowhere in the darkness of these days. Is there anybody there who feels that vibration. Who shows me the way to my love. Is there anybody there with that inclination. To bring back to sun to my heart. I find myself in a state of confusion. Life's like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion. Where's a place that I can stay. Save me don't let me get lost in the ocean. I need your help everyday to control my emotions. In the darkness of these days. Is there anybody there who feels that vibration. Who shows me the way to my love. Is there anybody there with that inclination. To bring back the sun to my heart. Fonte: site oficial

just one you,"Waking up in the morning. stepping out of bed. Oh the wishful dreaming. that's falling out of my head. Work all day till sunset. Make my dinner when I get home. Life slips by softly.

Oh that wishful dreaming. will never match what I'm feeling. It took one day. to make my dreams come true. I've found everyone I need. in just one you. Sometimes life seems far away. When it's right outside your door. Then one day you realize. You're not alone, anymore. It took one day. to make my dreams come true. I've found everyone I need. in just one you. It took one day. to make my dreams come true. I've found everyone I need. in just one you. You are my future. that saves me from the past. You are my joy and laughter. My love will always last with you"
kami o shin jiru,"Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. Do you say a prayer when your feeling down. Do you believe that love can turn your faith around. You're feeling high and low, but you don't know what to think. The world is full of saints who live their lives in sin. Don't ask the mirror ball you better ask yourself. I think you know the answers but maybe you can't tell. You'll see it all so clear just take a look inside. The judge you build inside your heart will always be your guide. Kami o shin jiru. Kami o shin jiru. Another day goes by and so does your life. You try to make some sense before your time to die. If you feel humility for something that is true. You'll find the secrets of this life deep inside of you. Kami o shin jiru. Kami o shin jiru. Kami o shin jiru. The innocent won't feel the judgement day. Kami o shin jiru. Kami o shin jiru. Kami o shin jiru. The innocent won't feel the judgement day. Kami o shin jiru. Kami o shin jiru. Kami o shin jiru."
kicks after six,"Music :Francis Buchholz, Jim Vallance. Lyrics:Herman Rarebell, Klaus Meine, Jim Vallance. Another morning, such as ordinary day. She's doin' time from nine to five. The hours waste away. There's no escape, She's a part of the bog machine. She's a slave to the suit and tie. Seven days a week. But every night. She can hardly wait. It feels alright. To give it all away. Good girls get their kicks after six. Good girls get their kicks after six. (She needs it bad, real real bad). She wants what she never had. All the things that make a good girl bad. She gets her kicks after six. Some days its hard to face the cruel reality. Just waitin' for the bell to ring. She wants to be free. It feels so good to start another endless night. She spreads her wings for another flight. She's running wild. But every night. She can hardly wait. It feels alright. To give it all away. Good girls get their kicks after six. (She needs it bad, real real bad). Good girls get their kicks after six. (Ooh yeah shake it for me baby). She wants what she never had. All the things that make a good girl bad. She gets her kicks after six. Good girls get their kicks after six. (She needs it bad, real real bad). Good girls get their kicks after six. (Ooh yeah nothin's gonna stop her). She wants what she never had. All the things that make a good girl bad. She gets her kicks after six. Good girls get their kicks after six. (She needs it bad, real real bad). Good girls get their kicks after six. (C'mon baby take it to the limit). She wants what she never had. All the things that make a good girl bad. She gets her kicks after six"
kiss of borrowed time,"Music :Klaus Meine. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. Leaves are falling from the trees. More than anything I want to be. Close to you back in your arms. I swear I'm still in love. Don't say a word just wait. As the bell will ring across the street we know. Those memories never go. Leaves are falling from the sky. Why don't we give it just another try. When the winter comes along. The shadows will be gone. The ice will melt away. 'Cause in front of the old fireplace is warm. Oooh, welcome home. Let me take you back again. To a love that's got a name. For you and me. Another day another chance. Only love will kill the pain. That hurts so deep. Don't waste a moment of your life. 'Cause it's just a kiss of borrowed time. Let me take you back again. To a love that's got a name. For you and me. Another day another chance. Only love will kill the pain. That hurts so deep. And we taste that wine."
lady starlight,"Walking through a winter night,. Counting the stars. And passing time. I dream about the summer days,. Love in the sun. And lonely bays. I see the stars, they're miles and miles away.

let's rock,She looked like mother nature. Dressed up in black. She had a ying and a yang. Tattooed on her back. A pretty little blonde on a big white horse. I wanted a ride she said of course. Let’s rock let’s roll. The party’s on we’re having a ball. We’re gonna leave a sting in your soul. We put the rock back in the roll. Let’s rock let’s roll. She looked like a dancer. And god only knows. She must have had a thing. For scorpions. To make little love wouldn’t be no crime. And what came next really blew my mind. Let’s rock let’s roll. The party’s on we’re having a ball. We’re gonna leave a sting in your soul. We put rock back in the roll. Let’s rock let’s roll. Coming together. Rocking forever let’s rock. The party’s on. All night long let’s rock
life goes around,"Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. You're climbing up the ladder on this shaking monkey tree.. Dreams are coming true that are just far beyond belief.. You're facing every storm that's blowing right into your face.. What happened was it's waiting that you're falling in disgrace.. You really never know.. But life will always go. around, around, around, around. around, around, around, around. around, around, around, life goes around.. Your heading for tomorrow for the better days in life.. But you can only make it if you stand the test of time.. You really never know.. But life will always go. around, around, around, around. around, around, around, around. around, around, around, life goes around.. Just put a china in your pocket. Keep it in there as long as you can.. Take the magic and just lock it.. Where you'll still find the boy inside of man, inside of man, inside of man.. You really never know.. But life will always go. around, around, around, around. around, around, around, around. around, around, around, life goes around.. Well, you know sometimes life doesn't go straight.. It doesn't go left.. It doesn't go right.. Sometimes it just goes nowhere.. But in the end,. Life goes around.. Around, around, around, around. around, around, around, around. around, around, around, life goes around.. Around, around, around, around. around, around, around, around."
life is too short,Have you ever seen the morning. When the sun comes up the shore. And the silence makes. A beautiful sound. Have you ever sat there waiting. For the time to stand still. For all the world to stop. From turning around. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. Have you ever seen the glowing. When the moon is on the rise. And the dreams are close. To the ones that we love. Have you ever sat there waiting. For heaven to give a sign. So we could find the place. Where angels come from. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. And you run. 'Cause life is too short. There's a time that turns. I'd turn back time. But I don't say I can. It only works if you believe in the truth. Well there's a time to live. And a time to cry. But if you're by my side. I will try to catch a star. I'll try to catch a star. Just for you. And I run. 'Cause life is too short. And I run. 'Cause life is too short. And I run. 'Cause life is too short. And I run. 'Cause life is too short. Too short. Too short. Life is too short. Too short. Too short. Life is too short.
life's like a river,As years are passing by. Silence becomes your friend. You see the world in a different way. Don't be afraid of getting old. Life's still full of joy. And the beauty of the past is rejoicing your mind. When days are getting short. And winter comes along. Your life slows down and down. Like a river is getting wide. The worlds have lost their voice. You remember your morning flowing to the endless sea. When days are getting short. And winter comes along. Your life slows down and down. Like a river is getting wide. The worlds have lost their voice. You remember your morning flowing to the endless sea. Life's like a river in the mountain. Life's like a sea without end. Life's like a river in the mountain. Life's like a sea without end. Life's like a river in the mountain. Life's like a sea without end. Life's like a river in the mountain. Life's like a sea without end.

lorelei,There was a time. When we sailed on together. Once had a dream. That we shared on the way. There was a place. Where we used to seek shelter. I never knew the pain. of the price I would pay. You led me on. With a cloak and a dagger. And I didn't know. You had made other plans. You had me believe. We were meant forever. I really thought. My heart would be safe in your hands. Lorelei. My ship has passed you by. And though you promised me to show the way. You led me astray. You were my Lorelei. What kind of fool was I. Cause I believed in every word you said. And now I wonder why. Lorelei. There was a time. When we held one another. Baring our souls. In the light of the flame. Those were the days. Now I've lost my illusions. Sometimes I wake in the night. And I call out your name. Lorelei. My ship has passed you by. And though you promised me to show the way. You led me astray. You were my Lorelei. What kind of fool was I. Cause I believed in every word you said. And now I wonder why. Lorelei. Now there's a light. That shines on the river. Blinding my eyes. From so far away. Shot through the heart. But now I know better. As hard as it is to resist. The song that you play. Lorelei. My ship has passed you by. And though you promised me to show the way. You led me astray. You were my Lorelei. What kind of fool was I. Cause I believed in every word you said. And now I wonder why. Lorelei
love is blind,"(Written by Herman Rarebell). I closed my eyes, didn't want to see. Believed the lies you said to me. You played a game, I played along. But now I know I was not the only one. You treated me just like a fool. I was in love, you shake my soul. The way you touched, I never knew before. Can't lose you, no, don't close the door. I wanna feel you, I wanna touch you. I wanna feel you by my side. Love is, love is blind. Don't you know it's a state of mind. Love is, love is blind. Love is blind, baby. Didn't know 'bout your double life. But something told me I was right inside. Things you said, they felt so good. The act you played was oh so cute. But then I got behind your scene. I wanna go but I can't leave. The way you touched, I never knew before. Can't lose you, no, don't close the door. I wanna feel you, I wanna touch you. I wanna feel you by my side. Love is, love is blind. Don't you know it's a state of mind. Love is, love is blind. Love is blind, baby. Love is, love is blind. Love is, love is blind. Love is, love is blind. Love is, love is blind. Love is blind, baby. Love is, love is blind."
love is the answer,"All of my life. I asked what I have to try. to get out of darkness, into the light. The world is a mess. Money it's a plague. eats our soul. and leaves us alone. I wanna know.

love is war,I'm a man. Trying to understand. The reason I'm lost in this world. Tonight. I was blind. I just couldn't see the signs. Caught in your web of lies. It's too dark to sleep. Too late to pray. Too hard to reach. Too much to save. You were once a friend to me. Now you are my enemy. Passion turns to hate and you make. Hate worth fighting for. I will re-write history. And you will not exist to me. On the day you crossed the line. I found out love is war. Life goes by. Faster than lightning strikes. Crashes before you can say. Goodbye. Too scared to run. Too proud to hide. Too far to fall. Too high to climb. You were once a friend to me. Now you are my enemy. Passion turns to hate and you make. Hate worth fighting for. I will re-write history. And you will not exist to me. On the day you crossed the line. I found out love is war. I laid down my defenses. I opened up the door. I gave you what you wanted. I couldn’t give you more. And I gave you everything. You said it’s all or nothing. To you it’s just a game. A game you’re never losing. You were once a friend to me. Now you are my enemy. Passion turns to hate and you make. Hate worth fighting for. I will re-write history. And you will not exist to me. On the day you crossed the line. I found out love is war. You were once a friend to me. Now you are my enemy. Passion turns to hate and you make. Hate worth fighting for. I will re-write history. And you will not exist to me. On the day you crossed the line. I found out love is war. Found out love is war

lust or love?,"Music :Klaus Meine. Lyrics:Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell, Jim Vallance. The innocence is gone. But still I'm holding on. Searchin' for love that lasts forever. Lookin' for a place. Where love can hide away. Takin' a chance it's now or never. Maybe it's time to draw the line. There's just one thing that's on my mind. Is it lust, is it love. Whatever it is I can't get enough. Is it lust, is it love. When I look around tell me who can I trust. Is it love. Lovers come and go. Sometimes it's hard to know. If this will be a night to treasure. When the damage has been done. And the hurting has begun. You'll justify a moment's pleasure. Is it lust, is it love. Whatever it is I can't get enough. Is it lust, is it love. It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above. Is it lust, is it love. When I look around tell me who can I trust. Is it love. Lust or love. Maybe it's time to draw the line. There's just one thing that's on my mind. Is it lust, is it love. Whatever it is I can't get enough. Is it lust, is it love. It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above. Is it lust, is it love. Still lookin' for more, it's never enough. Is it lust, is it love. When I look around tell me who can I trust. Is it love, is it love, is it love. Is it love, is it love"

Someone's calling your name. Why don't we make it true. Maybe I, maybe you. Maybe I, maybe you. Are just dreaming sometimes. But the world would be cold. Without dreamers like you. Maybe I, maybe you. Are just soldiers of love. Born to carry the flame. Bringin' light to the dark. You look up to the sky. With all those questions in mind. All you need is to hear. The voice of your heart. In a world full of pain. Someone's calling your name. Why don't we make it true. Maybe I, maybe you"

Seem to burn on the ground. Gone, gone.... My mightmares are gone. The moons in the sky. Seemed to eat up the sun. Is that the wind in your eyes. That is soothing my mind?. Is that the night in your eyes. That is soothing my mind?. Back from polar nights. I was down.... I was out.... The nights at the pole've been. So cold without you!. I was down.... I was out.... The pole-star was bringing me. Back home to you.. Is that the wind in your eyes. That is soothing my mind?. Is that the night in your eyes. That is soothing my mind?."

raised on rock,I was born in a hurricane. Nothing to lose and everything to gain. Ran before I walked. Reaching for the top. Out of control just like a runaway train. I never walked on the narrow path. I always wanted what I didn't have. All was not enough. Riding lady luck. Driving in the fast lane and just stepped on the gas. Cause I was raised on rock. My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone. Yeah I was raised on rock. My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul. And I was raised on rock. Shoot me up baby make me high. And hit the jackpot in the heat of the night. Wanna kiss your lips. Wanna move your hips. See my desire in your laser-beam eyes. You shake me up got me spinning 'round. You know what's going up must come down. Tomorrow I'll be gone. A million miles from home. The only road I know leads out of town. Cause I was raised on rock. My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone. Yeah I was raised on rock. My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul. And I was raised on rock. Growing up with the guitar men. Growing up way too fast. Follow the sound of a rock And roll band. This call will always last. Cause I was raised on rock. My dad was howling but my heart was a rolling stone. Yeah I was raised on rock. My mama said I had a devil to scratch my soul. And I was raised on rock. Yeah I was raised on rock
remember the good times,"Good times bad times. Bad times good times. We were twisting Chubby Checker style. In a roaring sixties summer night. We walked the moon and we were free. When Jimi played guitar. We shared a dream with Martin Luther King. We saw J.F.K. in West Berlin. When he spoke those famous words that day. Our world was not the same. Remember the good times. Remember the bad times. Remembering my life, your life. Let the film just roll. We were lost in shock, the world was doomed. Nikita hit us with a shoe. We watched the world go upside down. When the Kennedys got shot. We were screaming when the world was fab. We had Rock 'n' Roll invade our hearts. We had Elvis, Janis, Marilyn. And hair, to let it grow. Remember the good times. Remember the bad times. Remembering my life, your life. Let the film just roll. Remember the good times. Remember the bad times. Remembering my life, your life. We're still standing after all. Back in the cold war. Our hearts were warm. Just because sex was free. In the summer of love. Remember the good times. Remember the bad times. Remembering my life, your life. Let the film just roll. Remember the good times. Remember the bad times. Remembering my life, your life. We're still standing after all. Good times bad times. Bad times good times. I'm still standing. Let the film just roll. I'm still standing. We're still standing after all"
restless nights,"Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell, Jim Vallance. Blackout in London. Just slip'n slide. Blackout in London. I'm just about to lose my mind. Big time in Paris. Time's gonna fly. Big time in Paris. It's c'est la vie for me tonight. Here I go. To take the one and only road I know. In my life. Here I go. Another place to bare my heart and soul. Restless nights. Hot shot in Dallas. A wild horse to ride. Hot shot in Dallas. I don't know how but I survived. Rock hard in Rio. Pure sex and crime. Rock hard in Rio. It's just too much to take tonight. Here I go. To take the one and only road I know. In my life. Here I go. Another place to bare my heart and soul. Restless nights. Restless nights. Restless nights. Red hot in Moscow. Turn back the tide. Red hot in Moscow. The eagle rocks the bear tonight. Die hard in Tokyo. Lexington nights. Die hard in Tokyo. I barely made it out alive. Here I go. To take the one and only road I know. In my life. Here I go. Another place to bare my heart and soul"

Who could hang a name on you?. When you change with every new day. Still I'm gonna miss you.... Don't question why she needs to be so free. She'll tell you it's the only way to be.

send me an angel,The wise man said just walk this way. To the dawn of the light. The wind will blow into your face. As the years pass you by. Hear this voice from deep inside.

shapes of things,"Shapes of things before my eyes. Just teach me to despise. Will time make men more wise?. Here within my lonely frame. My eyes just hurt my brain. But will it seem the same?. Come tomorrow, will I be older?. Come tomorrow, may be a soldier. Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?. Now the trees are almost green. But will they still be seen. When time and tide have been?. Oh, into your passing hands. Please don't destroy these lands. Don't make them desert sands. Come tomorrow, will I be older?. Come tomorrow, may be a soldier. Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?"
she said,"In every corner of my memory. There's no place you wouldn't be. lf anything, I wish I had. Another dream with you. Life was forever yesterday. Nothing in the world could take. Your love away, will I ever know. That time will ease the pain. For me someday. She said I won't leave you, ever. Just love me forever. She said you can leave, but never. Walk away. Lights reflecting in the evening sun. Back to the place where we were one. Soul mates forever about to chase. Rainbows in the dark. Another day to destiny. Come on and set me free. When I close my eyes, I see your smile. As I walk in the pouring rain. I call your name. She said I won't leave you, ever. Just love me forever. She said, we will be together, someday. She said I won't leave you, ever. Just love me forever. She said, you can leave, but never. Walk away. I can see a million faces. When I take a walk outside. But I just never knew. That I could go a million places. And I'd see always, only you. The loneliness crawls up on me. Without you there's no me. At any time or any place. But time will ease the pain. For me someday. She said I won't leave you, ever. Just love me forever. She said, we will be together, someday. She said, I will wait forever. I won't leave you ever. She said, you can leave, but never. Ever walk away. Don't walk away. Oh no don't walk away. I'II be waiting, always. Until you'Il wake up from this dream. Someday"
she's knocking at my door,"Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. She's knocking at my door. That little angel knows the score. She's knocking at my door. But I won't let her out no more. I want a piece of that pie. She's driving me completely wild. She's giving me a private dance. She's playing with my confidence. The way she's coming down the stairs. Makes me surrender just right there. This girl is out of this world. Heaven must be a place on earth. She's knocking at my door. That little angel knows the score. She's knocking at my door. But I won't let her out no more. She's like a shot of adrenaline. She made me fly with broken wings. With nothing but the radio on. Her body is the song I want. She's knocking at my door. That little angel knows the score. She's knocking at my door. But I won't let her out no more. The light is on but no one's home tonight. We lock the door, we turn the key. And throw it right outside. Come on and set me free. If you had candy once before. For you keep coming back for more. She's got the sweetest touch of all. The longest legs that I recall. Before she leaves she turns around. The elevator takes her down. She says oh well the city rocks. I go to sleep but then it knocks. She's knocking at my door. That little angel knows the score. She's knocking at my door. But I won't let her out no more."
ship of fools,Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. Another bloody Monday. Thirty-nine Just died. All hell breaks loose in the crowd. A hopeless helter skelter. Another mindless crime. Some corner of the world is burning down. Heading for a nervous breakdown. Can't take it anymore. I see the fear explode just like. A thousant nights before. The ship of fools. Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm. It won't take long 'till we collide. The ship of fools. Keeps on following the siren's call. Damned to be sacrificed. Corrupt politicians. Promise paradise. The thieves are reaching out for the crown. Violence is a killer. Threatens all our lives. Judgment day has come here and now. Heading for a nervous breakdown. Can't take it anymore. I see the fear explode just like. A thousant nights before. The ship of fools. Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm. It won't take long 'till we collide. The ship of fools. Keeps on following the siren's call. Damned to be sacrificed. Heading for a nervous breakdown. Can't take it anymore. I see the fear explode just like. A thousant nights before. The ship of fools. Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm. It won't take long 'till we collide. The ship of fools. Keeps on following the siren's call. Damned to be sacrificed. The ship of fools.

Growing up to be the sunshine of my life. Come talk to me. Don't run away. Don't let the distance grow. The door's wide open. Don't ever think. There is no way home. Sly come home tonight.

So much changed in our lives. The're too many scars deep under my skin. Love turned to hate and hate to love. Let's start all over again. And now I wonder what life will bring. Just let us laugh. The tears away. No more hard feelings no. Cause after all. You're my flesh and blood. I don't want you to fall. Sly come home tonight. The world is so bad you're drive ‘em all mad. With your smile. Sly come home alive. When the runaway train took you away. A part of me died. Sly come home tonight. The world is so bad you're drive ‘em all mad. With your smile. Sly my joy and pride.

someday is now,"Blood rains down across the tundra. Ice flows through my veins. As my life drains. Northern bound, my dogs are dying. But I still know. That nothing is impossible. I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer. I'm pushed to the limit. Said I'd do it someday. Someday is now. When I see the world around me receding. No time for bleeding. Show the world how. Someday is now. Eight steps till I reach the summit. My line breaks and I fall down. The rocky terrain. My bones are broken into pieces. My mind can't wait. To get up and do it again. I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer. I'm pushed to the limit. Said I'd do it someday. Someday is now. When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying. There's no time for crying. I'm gonna win someday. No turning back, no more yesterdays. I just won't get lost in the haze. All my tomorrows, no sadness, no sorrow. Watch out for the rest of my days. Stronger, the longer. I'm pushed to the limit. Said I'd do it someday. Someday is now. When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying. There's no room for crying. I'm gonna win some way. Someday is now"

sting in the tail,Bang bang rock with the gang. Bang bang rock with the gang. Save me from myself before I'm going down. My world went kind of crazy spinning 'round'n'round. My body's in a mess from head to toe. Got nothing to lose and nowhere to go. Bang bang rock with the gang. Bang bang rock with the gang. I'm driving out of town just follow my heart. I think I'm gonna be a rock'n'roll star. The girls would go mad I'd give 'em all I can give. If I had a cheap guitar and one dirty riff. Yo Yo I got to go. Here comes another show. Hail hail a sting in the tail. Hail hail a sting in the tail. Rocking night after night day after day. There's plenty of love and no escape. Life's screaming and rolling like a monster train. Destination nowhere I won't be late. Yo Yo I got to go. Here comes another show. Hail hail a sting in the tail. Hail hail a sting in the tail. Hail hail a sting in the tail.

stone in my shoe,"Music : Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics: Klaus Meine. I keep on dancin' on the roof. Try not to fall, stay in the groove. A step too far. I'm out of place. Life beats you up some of these days. Just like a whisper there's a voice. Inside of me. It's sayin' you ain't got a choice. Well, can't you see. Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down. Ooh, you better find a way around. I keep on walkin' in the clouds. Find out what life is all about. I keep on runnin' away from here. To learn the grass ain't greener there. Just like a whisper there's a voice. Inside of me. It's sayin' you ain't got no choice. As you can see. Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down. Ooh, you better find a way around. Ooh, cause no one else but you. Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe. Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down. Ooh, you better find a way around. Ooh, cause no one else but you. Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe. Inside your shoe. Inside your shoe. Inside your shoe. Yeah. Keep rockin' in the street. Keep landing on my feet. Keep runnin' on and on. Still play my favorite blond. Keep rockin' mother earth. Just all around the world. These days mean safer sex. Get my survival pack. My orgasm isn't faked. Ooh Lord, I need a break. And what's annoying, too. Is that damn thing in my shoe. Ooh, there is a stone in my shoe."

tainted love,Sometimes I feel I've got to. Run away I've got to. Get away. From the pain that you drive into the heart of me. The love we share. Seems to go nowhere. And I've lost my light. For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night. Once I ran to you. Now I'll run from you. This tainted love you've given. I give you all a boy could give you. Take my tears and that's not nearly all. Tainted love. Tainted love. Now I know I've got to. Run away I've got to. Get away. You don't really want it any more from me. To make things right. You need someone to hold you tight. And you'll think love is to pray. But I'm sorry I don't pray that way. Once I ran to you. Now I'll run from you. This tainted love you've given. I give you all a boy could give you. Take my tears and that's not nearly all. Tainted love. Tainted love. Tainted love. Tainted love. Once I ran to you. Now I'll run from you. This tainted love you've given.

taste of love,"In her life not much loving. From the early years she felt that she was falling. Even I've never seen her laughing. Ask her why and she would say. That she's still hoping for love. Taste of love, taste of love, taste of love. In her time so much growling. Why'd you ask her?. No one hears that she's still calling. On and on and even you say loving. Ask her why and she would say. That she's still hoping for love. Taste of love! Taste of love! Taste of love!. All the time he sees. That whole my loving is true. It's easy to wish. It's breaking her heart. He even says the words I love you. She's giving her taste of love. In her life so much crying. From the early years. She felt that love was dying. Even I've never seen her laughing. Ask her why and she would lie. That she's still hoping for love. Taste of love! Taste of love! Taste of love!. All the time he sees. That whole my loving is true. It's easy to wish. It's breaking her heart. He even says the words I love you. She's giving her taste of love. One more time no more fooling. Why'd you ask her?. No one sees that she's still running.

taxman woman,Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. I wake up in the morning I'm thinking of you. In Dollars and Cents in high heel shoes. I start to think and the headache goes boom. I'm counting the bills that are stacked to the moon. The money I'm giving to you. I could live on forever (on the sunny side). What can I do so my life. Turns around for the better (Got knows that I tried). Taxman woman I keep running. Can't you see it's only money. Taxman woman I keep running. Can't you see it's so hard honey. To keep up with you. I work twice as hard what else can I do. To make up the part that's been taken by you. If it wasn't for you I would be rich. But instead I'm a poor son of a bitch. The money I'm giving to you. I could live on forever (on the sunny side). What can I do so my life. Turns around for the better (Got knows that I tried). Taxman woman I keep running. Can't you see it's only money. Taxman woman I keep running. Can't you see it's so hard honey. Taxman woman I keep running. Can't you see that it ain't funny. Taxman woman I keep running. Can't you see it's so hard honey. To keep up with you
tease me please me,"I've been around the world. I've known a lot of girls. Livin' and lovin'. It's hard to keep them all in line. I've seen a lot of sights. Many crazy nights. Cruisin' and boozin'. It's a wonder that I'm still alive. Never wasted any time. Never missed a beat. Total satisfaction. Always guaranteed. Tease me. Please me. No one needs to know. Tease me. Please me. Before I have to go. Spread the word around. The boys are back in town. Reelin' and rockin'. We're rollin' with it win or lose. The girls are dressed to kill. Lookin' for a thrill. Slidin' and glidin'. Sometimes they make it hard to choose. I never wasted any time. Never missed a beat. Total satisfaction. Always guaranteed. Tease me. Please me. No one needs to know. Tease me. Please me. Before I have to go. Tease me. Please me. We'll take it nice and slow. Tease me. Please me. Just let the feeling grow. . Music: Matthias Jabs, Jim Vallance.

the best is yet to come,"Across the desert plains. Where nothing dares to grow. I taught you how to sing. You taught me everything I know. And thought the night is young. And we don't know. if we'll live to see the sun. The best is yet to come. I know, you know. That we've only just begun. Through the highs and lows. And how can I live without you.

Through the highs and lows. And how can I live without you. You're such a part of me. And you've always been the one. Keeping me forever young. And the best is yet to come. Hey hey oh.

the good die young,You wake up. Watch the world go 'round. You shiver. Feeling upside down. Your heart is beating fast. Pumping blood to your head. Another day to fight. You have a prayer on your lips under the desert sun. And a loaded gun. You remember every word. That your father said. Stay out of trouble son. And be true to yourself. You'll be working like a dog. Raise a family. And life will be alright. But now it's written in the stars if you'll make it out alive. Out alive. The good die young. There might be no tomorrow. In god we trust. Through all this pain and sorrow. The good die young. The flame will burn forever. And no one knows your name. Bring the boys back home again. It was a quiet day. On the streets of hope. When the bomb went off. At the side of the road. Sounds of breaking steel. An windshield full of blood. No enemy in sight. It feels like in a movie scenes are passing by. It's your life. The good die young. There might be no tomorrow. In god we trust. Through all this pain and sorrow. The good die young. The flame will burn forever. And no one knows your name. Bring the boys back home again. You remember every word. That your father said. Stay out of trouble son. And be true to yourself. You have a prayer on your lips under the desert sun. And a loaded gun. The good die young. There might be no tomorrow. In god we trust. Through all this pain and sorrow. The good die young. The flame will burn forever. And no one knows your name. Bring the boys back home again. Home again

the same thrill,"I remember when my teacher said:. ""How you wanna make your life?"". I said: ""I can play guitar. And it will be alright listen!"". When I came out of school. They said: ""Which way you wanna go?"". But there was no way strong enough. Compared with rock'n roll. To get the same thrill. Anyhow I've found a job. They tried to break me with their rules. But they had no chance at all. 'Cause I knew what to do. To get the same thrill like rock'n roll. I had a feeling they couldn't buy. Still got that feeling they still can't buy. They still can't buy. They still can't buy. Tell me the alternative. To what I'm doing, but I guess. There's no other way of life. Which is strong like this"

Like a hundred years ago. If all those missiles would be bread. No one had to starve tonight. We run for shelter and what is left. Is a life ain't worth a dime. So far away from human rights.

through my eyes,"Leaving through the back door. Freezing in the cold. Communication breakdown. Emotional overload. Been through a wall of fire. Now I feel like, the ashes glow. Cars passing on the freeway. My mind is on the run. I keep running from my shadow. I'm not the only one. Somewhere in the distance. Someone's taking flight. Destination unknown. Just fade into the light. There's so much said and done. But after all. The time has come, to leave it all. Behind. If you could see it through my eyes. You'll know I tried to change it all. I've been trying all my life. To stand up every time I fall. If you could see it through my eyes. I feel sadness up my spine. The future on my hands. I'm standing here alone. With open arms again. Tomorrow ain't no stranger. There'll be a lucky star. And love will find it's way. Into someones heart. Too late for tears. No time to be confused. It's just the echo of our. Swan song. If you could see it through my eyes. You'll know I tried to change it all. I've been trying all my life. To stand up every time I fall. If you could see it through my eyes. You'd see that love will always wait. Somewhere out there is my life. A new love that comes my way. If you could see it through my eyes. Through my eyes. What was meant to be forever. Is breaking all apart. What was meant to be forever. Leaves the hole inside my heart. What was meant to be forever. We throw it all away. What was meant to be forever. Was nothing but a game. What was meant to be forever. Is breaking all apart. What was meant to be forever"
thunder and lightning,I left you once you killed me twice. Seems like the devil rolled the dice. What have you done what can we do. To make it through. Remember when life was free. As free as our minds. Wounded hearts. Thunder and lightning in the heat of the night. Some lonely highway it’s a hell of a ride. Turn it up to extreme let the engine scream. And leave it all behind. Thunder and lightning. In a stormy night. The gun was pointed to my head. You walked away and I was dead. In the name of love you’ve turned to dust. What I’ve called trust. Remember when we were young. And innocent too. The monsters stayed behind the walls. No fears at all. Thunder and lightning in the heat of the night. Last exit my way it’s a hell of a ride. Turn it up to extreme let the engine scream. And leave it all behind. Thunder and lightning. In a stormy night
time will call your name,They're days that make you fly. They're days you wanna cry. Sometimes the walls come tumbling down. They're moments in the dark. When pain just floods your heart. And you surrender one more time. Just take a walk out in the rain. With every drop that falls. You know the sun will shine again. They're days you're naturally high. They're days you wanna die. Sometimes your world goes down in flames. They're moments deep in love. But when it breaks your heart. You just surrender one more time. Just take a walk out in the rain. With every step you make. You learn that life means constant change. Tomorrow's all that counts. As life goes round 'n round. You gotta draw the line. Goodbye yesterday. Tomorrow's all that counts. As life goes round 'n round. And if you keep the faith. Time will call your name. Take a walk out in the rain. With every breath you take. You feel your soul is free again. Tomorrow's all that counts. As life goes round 'n round. You gotta draw the line. Goodbye yesterday. Tomorrow's all that counts. As life goes round 'n round. And if you keep the faith. Time will call your name. Tomorrow's all that counts. As life goes round 'n round. You gotta draw the line. Goodbye yesterday. Tomorrow's all that counts. As life goes round 'n round. And if you keep the faith

to be with you in heaven,Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Klaus Meine. You can shoot me down. You can drag me 'round. Girl I'll get you. It won't be long. You can smash my heart. You can trash our love. But my desire for you is much too strong. To be with in heaven. I would go through the darkest hell. In heaven. There's no cure for love that kills. You can waste my time. But you can't change my mind. I won't stop you. So just go on. You can play your games. But it's all in vain. Cause' my desire for you is much too strong. To be with in heaven. I would go through the darkest hell. In heaven. There's no cure for love that kills. To be with in heaven. I would go through the darkest hell. In heaven. There's no cure for love that kills. Girl I'm on fire. Heaven seems so close tonight. Girl I would die for your love. You can shoot me down. You can drag me 'round. Girl I'll get you. It won't be long. You can smash my heart. You can trash our love. But my desire for you is much too strong. To be with in heaven. I would go through the darkest hell. In heaven. There's no cure for love that kills. To be with in heaven.

too far,"15. Too Far. Music: Matthias Jabs. Lyrics: Matthias Jabs, Klaus Meine. I wanna read in your eyes. That you mean yes when you say no. I wanna take a step across that line. ´Till you can feel my love. . You opend the door and it hits to the core. . Ain´t got no pearls or diamond rings. I only got my heartbeat. But it won´t be long and I will win. And melt inside your heart. . You opend the door and it hits to the core. . We went too far way too far. There´s no turning back this time. We went too far way too far. But you´re gonna be all mine. . You opend the door and it hits to the core. . We went too far way too far. There´s no turning back this time. We went too far way too far. But it´s gonna be allright. . We went too far way too far. It can never be too far. We went too far way too far. To find nothin´ but real love.

Tonight we will slip away. Just rocking and reeling. Beyond the point of no return. The fever's rising 'till we'll crash and burn. There's something in my veins that is thicker than blood. Nothing in the world this is all we've got. So come on if you wanna feel the sting. Come on come on baby shake that thing. I wanna turn you on. Yeah let's celebrate all night. We're starting all over. You turn me into a wild. And hard Rock'n Roller. Into the light out of the dark. A passion never known invades my heart. The universe is rocking like heaven and hell.

I wanna turn you on
twentieth century man,In the jungle of these times. Honest love's so hard to find. In the world of video. Computers tell you what to do. The world's devoted to the Dollar sign. Remote-controlled and on the line. Plug in man on the rack. Waiting for a heart attack. And no chance to die. No more space for love. The world gets really tough. Can't you see the end. Twentieth Century Man?. In the jungle of these times. There's nothing left for them to buy. They look for God on the screen. They've got even dream-machines. They are mesmerized. No more space for love. The world gets really tough. Can't you see the end. Twentieth Century Man?. No more space for love. The world gets really tough. Can't you see the end. Twentieth Century Man?.
under the same sun,"I saw the morning. It was shattered by a gun. Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried. I saw a mother. She was praying for her son. Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die. Do you ever ask yourself. Is there a Heaven in the sky. Why can't we get it right. 'cause we all live under the same sun. We all walk under the same moon. Then why, why can't we live as one. I saw the evening. Fading shadows one by one. We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice. I saw the children. The children of the sun. How they wept, how they bled, how they died. Do you ever ask yourself. Is there a Heaven in the sky. Why can't we stop the fight. 'cause we all live under the same sun. We all walk under the same moon. Then why, why can't we live as one. Sometimes I think I'm going mad. We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care. But in my heart it doesn't change. We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love. And does it really matter. If there's a heaven up above. We sure could use some love. 'Cause we all live under the same sky. We all look up at the same stars. Then why, why can't we live as one?. 'Cause we all live under the same sun. We all walk under the same moon. We all live under the same sky. We all look up at the same stars. Then why, tell me why can't we live as one?"
unholy alliance,It came up crawling from the ruins of the past. And I just can't believe my eyes. It wears the same old face. We thought was dead and gone. Forever buried by the time. Unholy alliance. Unholy alliance. It came up screaming from the ashes of the grave. To make this world a battle field. It's got a voice that. Steals the courage from the brave. And leaves a scar that will not heal. Unholy alliance. Unholy alliance. Don't wanna hear the same old lie. That spreads the fear. Only fools think it's cool. We must be blind not to see the signs. How can we dare to look away. In the wake of yesterday. Troubled times don't turn your back to the lions. Troubled times just learn your lesson well. The party is over. We must be blind not to see the signs. How can we dare to look away. In the wake of yesterday. Troubled times don't turn your back to the lions. Troubled times just learn your lesson well.

we built this house,"Love is the glue that hold us together. Faith and believing is the key, this door of forever. Baby you and I, we're every reason on earth. Now and again, it's always us. Against the world, against the world. When the rain fell. And the flood came. And the wind blew hot. Like a hammer on these walls. We didn't crack or break or fall. We built this house on a rock. This house on a rock. And there is a time to face stormy weather. But we are always standing strong, a lifetime together. Baby you and I, we don't regret anything. Now it's the two of us again. Against the wind, against the wind. When the rain fell. And the flood came. And the wind blew hot. Like a hammer on these walls. We didn't crack or break or fall. We built this house on a rock. This house on a rock. Brick by brick, we have set it up. Oh men, if this walls could talk. Bit by bit, based it on trust. We gave it all we got. When the rain fell. And the flood came. And the wind blew hot. Like a hammer on these walls. We didn't crack or break or fall. We built this house on a rock. This house on a rock. We built this house on a rock. This house on a rock"

we were born to fly,Hello again. You've been alone a while. And I can use a friend. Your shades are down. And I've been waiting here for you to come around. And it's not about forgiveness.

we will rise again,Holding on to you like broken glass. Every touch cuts deeper than the last. I know I should leave. But it feels so good to bleed. Poison kisses lock us in this cage. Our lives got twisted in this masquerade. I can't seem to shake this incurable need. This endless addiction I feed. Angels on fire. They fall from the sky. Heaven and hell will be burning tonight. Covered in ashes I cry out your name. And out of the flames. We will rise again. Run in to the shadows where we hide. Bodies tender as our worlds collide. Nothing is sacred and everything’s wrong. But you and I keep holding on. Angels on fire. They fall from the sky. Heaven and hell will be burning tonight. Covered in ashes I cry out your name. And out of the flames. We will rise again. No temptation is my sin. Not my darkest deepest whim. Angels on fire. They fall from the sky. Heaven and hell will be burning tonight. Covered in ashes I cry out your name. And out of the flames. We will rise. Angels on fire. They fall from the sky. Heaven and hell will be burning tonight. Covered in ashes I cry out your name. And out of the flames. We will rise again. We will rise again. We will rise
we'll burn the sky,"I'm in love with the sunshine. I'm in love with the fallin' rain. Everything seems to call your name. Yesterday you were leavin'. Leavin' life and all the pain. Everything wants you back again. Wants you back again. Wants you back again. I found myself through you. And there was love in my life. I felt always naturaly high. And my love had a home. But now my mind has started to roam. You're my life giving fire. And you carry all my love. Through you I was so inspired. You're engraved deep in my heart. Heart, heart, heart. My dreams recall us being one. I've searched for you to be free. MY force of life you have always been. I feel blue since you've gone. You're breath of life surrounded me. When can I join you to be free?. Join you to be free. Join you to be free. Wait, can this be a dream?. There is a voice in my head. It belongs to you, it says. Don't cry, no need to be sad. There's a way to stay with you again. It's more than you ever had. And though death brings us apart. Our timeless love always grows. Because you are my other part. I know we've never been apart. Your love sets fire to my heart. We'll burn the sky. When it's time for me to die. We'll burn the sky, oh yeah. We'll burn the sky, oh yeah. When it's time, time, time. We'll burn the sky.

when love kills love,Suddenly I think I always knew. I had my share of mistakes made quite a few. Finally I know when that's for sure. I don't look back in anger anymore. Suddenly the sun comes up again. There's a new beginning when we pass the end. Finally I know when that's for sure. I don't look back in anger anymore. When love kills love. Will someone rescue me. When love kills love. It's cutting through so deep. Suddenly I wake up from a dream. Someone tells me I've been talking in my sleep. Finally I know when that's for sure. I don't believe in daydreams anymore. When love kills love. Will someone rescue me. When love kills love. It's cutting through so deep. Well life goes 'round And upside down It's pretty mad. When love kills love. Will someone set me free. When love kills love. It's cutting through so deep. How can we choose when all we loose is all we have. We run away from all the pain. We run away from all the pain. When love kills love. Will someone rescue me. When love kills love. It's cutting through so deep. When love kills love

I've got your sound still in my ears. While your traces disappear. I climb the stage again this night. Cause the place seems still alive. When the smoke is going down.

when the truth is a lie,"When I saw her for the first time. I was mesmerized and blown away. What if she would be the one to. Live and die for in an endless love. It hurts deep inside, hurts deep inside. When the truth is a lie. Inside, it hurts deep inside. When the truth is a lie. Love is blind and hard to find. Falling for her made me lose my mind. Hoping all was just a bad dream. Wishing I could travel back in time. It hurts deep inside, hurts deep inside. When the truth is a lie. Inside, it hurts deep inside. When the truth is a lie. Everybody I was talking to. All my friends confirmed it's true. No one really was taken by surprise, but me. I was really way too blind to see. Her betrayal, the reality. When I finally opened up my eyes. The love was gone. It hurts deep inside, hurts deep inside. When the truth is a lie. Inside, it hurts deep inside. When the truth is a lie"

where the river flows,"Under suburban skies. Where life is bleeding. Where concrete skies are grey. There's plenty of room for dreaming. I still keep coming here. Follow those traces.

You find me by the river. You find me. You find me. You find me where the river flows. Under the silent moon. This industrial city. Is heartland even though. Life's been not that pretty.

wind of change,"I follow the Moskva. Down to Gorky Park. Listening to the wind of change. An August summer night. Soldiers passing by. Listening to the wind of change. The world is closing in. Did you ever think. That we could be so close, like brothers. The future's in the air. I can feel it everywhere. Blowing with the wind of change. [Chorus:]. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change. Walking down the street. And distant memories. Are buried in the past forever. I follow the Moskva. Down to Gorky Park. Listening to the wind of change. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams. With you and me. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change. The wind of change blows straight. Into the face of time. Like a stormwind that will ring. The freedom bell for peace of mind. Let your balalaika sing. What my guitar wants to say. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams. With you and me. Take me to the magic of the moment. On a glory night. Where the children of tomorrow dream away. In the wind of change"
woman,"Woman... you can change my world.... Woman... you can change my world.... I'm chained to the fears inside these walls. The silence talks loud 'bout the things I recall. Through the bricks in the window, I scream at the world. But when no one is listening, it's hard to be heard. Woman... you can change my world... yeah.... Woman... there'll be no return.... I see shadows coming through the walls. I hear voices but no one's talking at all. I can feel the madness crawling up my spine. Reachin' out to grab your mind.... Woman... come and change my world.... Do you remember all those fears?. They won't leave me alone.... Do you remember all those tears?. I pretend to be strong.... Do you remember all the pain?. I'm getting tired of the game.... I cannot live, I cannot die.... I wanna know who the hell am I!!!. You've never seen me but I know you so well. And before it kills me I gotta break the spell. The deeper we touch, the higher we'll go. The time has come to heal my soul.... Woman... yeah... you can change my world.... Do you remember all those fears?. They won't leave me alone.... Do you remember all those tears?. I pretend to be strong.... Do you remember all the pain?. I'm getting tired of the game.... I cannot live, I cannot die.... I wanna know who the hell am I!!!. Woman... I'm gonna change your world.... Oooh yeah.... (gonna change your world)."
yellow butterfly,"In the temple of the gods. The day had come to come together. In the early morning sun. They saw that girl that came to heaven... They asked her 'bout life on Earth. If it was getting any better. She told 'em someone took her life. If they could send her back just one more time. She knew that someone feels so blue. Hold on. Wouldn't it be nice (Hold on, hold on, hold on). To spread the wings and fly (Hold on, hold on, hold on). To see him one more time. To be a yellow butterfly. He's been sitting on the bay. Lost inside a cloud of darkness. When he saw the butterfly dancing in the wind. The story goes. He knew that she was still soo close. Hold on. Wouldn't it be nice (Hold on, hold on, hold on). To spread the wings and fly (Hold on, hold on, hold on). To see him one more time. To be a yellow butterfly. Wouldn't it be nice...To spread the wings and fly.... To be a yellow.... Hold on. Wouldn't it be nice (Um wouldn't it b nice). To spread the wings and fly (Hold on, hold on, hold on). To see him one more time. To be a yellow butterfly"
yellow raven,"The yellow raven sipped the air. Of thunder and of rain. The yellow raven sipped the air. Gentle lies kissing the rain. Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?. Take me away to somewhere. Take me away from here!. Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?. Answer to my yearning. Take me away from here!. The firebird began to cry. When the music died away. The firebird began to cry. And smoke was slowly drifting by. Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?. Take me away to somewhere. Take me away from here!. Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?. Answer to my yearning. Take me away from here."

you give me all i need,"Music :Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics:Herman Rarebell. New love is blind. Why don't you see. You hurt me inside, you're killing me. It makes me sad all the time.

You give me all I need. Let's try again. There's still romance. We'll start a new life, take a chance. There are so many ways. Please don't forget it anyday. My heart's in pain. I need you so. My love's the same. So please don't go. You give me all I need. You give me all I need. You give me all I need. You give me all I need"
you the one,"Music : Rudolf Schenker. Lyrics: Klaus Meine. Another rainy morning. People rushing by. My head is still in the clouds. I dream with open eyes. Suddenly out of nowhere. She came into my life. Like we know each other. For quite a while. In the sound of silence. Time is standing still. There's some kind of bond between us. That's givin' me the chill. Do you really wonder. That we can burn the sky. It's written a thousand years ago. In the book of life. Are you the one that God had made for me. Are you the one who's always in my dreams. The one who keeps me goin'. When I can't go on. The one that I've been waiting for. For so long. Oh, yeah. Suddenly out of nowhere. She came into my life. Are you the one that God had made for me. Are you the one who's always in my dreams. Are you the one that God had made for me. Are you the one who's mine eternally. The one who keeps me dreamin'. When I'm sad and tired. Who gives my life a meaning. Till the day I die. Are you the one"
you're lovin' me to death,"YOU’RE LOVIN’ ME TO DEATH. Rudolf Schenker, Desmond Child, Andreas Carlsson and Eric Bazilian. . It's your move. I'm in pain. I'm a pawn. In your game. It's your life. I just happen to be in it for a while. . Oh, you're lovin’ me to death. You’re killin’ me with kindness. What's behind this sudden tenderness. . You're lovin’ me to death. And leavin’ me to die. You make me wanna scream. But my tongue is tied. You played me like a toy. You made my life a mess. Everybody knows. You're lovin’ me to death. . When you touch. Can you feel. Is your heart. Only made of steel. When you cry. Do you ever let emotions. Break your stride. . Oh, you take away my breath. Your unexpected hunger. Makes me wonder. What the hell comes next. . You're lovin’ me to death. And leavin’ me to die. You make me wanna scream. But my tongue is tied. You played me like a toy. You made my life a mess. Everybody knows. You're lovin’ me to death. .

your last song,"YOUR LAST SONG. . Here I am. Writing my last song for you. Hear the words carefully. And you'll see it's you. I'm leaving. Don't want to be the one to tell you. That I can't stay another day. . I'll throw the pages on the floor. I'm starting over like before. I'll change this stupid ending. And stay with you forever more. But when I'm lying next to you. It's hard to bargain with the truth. Cause when you know the love is gone. The time has come to write your last song. . There you are. Smiling at me from the next room. Beautiful as the first day I met you. And I'm so sorry. I couldn't be the one to love you. The way that you deserve to be. . I'll throw the pages on the floor. I'm starting over like before. I'll change this stupid ending. And stay with you forever more. But when I'm lying next to you. It's hard to bargain with the truth. Cause when you know the love is gone. The time has come to write your last song. . It's hard to think of you and I. As total strangers. I've lived this last goodbye. A million times or more in my mind. My mind, my mind. . Oh and I'm gonna miss you. But I can't go back. Even just to kiss you. Cause I can't exist. Just living a lie. Gotta lot of love to give. You know before I die. And as I watch you. Sing along. It's killing me to know. That it's your last song"
your light,"When you're feeling lost and blue. When there is no love for you. You'll find him and it's all right. It's all right, it's all right. When you're feeling down and low. When you've got no place to go. And when no one smiles hello. He's by your side, you know. When you're getting deaf and blind. When you drag one leg behind. And when you're finally gonna. Lose your mind. It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. 'Cause he is by your side. 'Cause he will be your guide. 'Cause he will be your light. And you're not alone, you're not alone. You're not alone, you're not alone."
