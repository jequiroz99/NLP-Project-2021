charmless man,"I met him in a crowded room. Where people go to drink away their gloom. He sat me down and so began. The story of a charmless man. Educated the expensive way. He knows his claret from his beaujolais. I think he’d like to have been Ronnie Kray. But then nature didn’t make him that way. He thinks he’s educated, airs those family shares. Will protect him, that we’ll respect him. He moves in circles of friends who just pretend. That they like him, he does the same to them. And when you put it all together. There’s the model of a charmless man. He knows the singers and their cavalry. Says he can get in anywhere for free. I began to go a little cross-eyed. And from this charmless man I just had to hide. He talks at speed he gets nosebleeds. He doesn’t see his days are tumbling down upon him. And yet he tries so hard to please. He’s just so keen for you to listen. But no-one’s listening. And when you put it all together there’s the model of a charmless man."

Trying so hard to find sense when there's none at all Ahhh (2x). Down (20x). Staring at the sun all day. If you stare too long you get burned away. Now there's nothing left of me so have it all. Ahhh. Forgetting again I blame. My past has just faded away. Now I can tell you everything there is to know about. Ahhh (2x). Down (40x)

entertain me,The weekend is back. But so is he. Head to the floodlights. See the fraternity. They're waiting. I hear them up in the north. Down in the south. All that is spewing. Spewing out of his mouth. Entertain me. At his'n'hers dating. Bored minds agree. Requirements to be stated. And replies awaited. She wants a loose fit. He wants Instant Whip. Guesstimates her arrival. Will she want it. Really badly?. Entertain me. A car. A house. Both in a street. The boredom of a sober week. The weekend's here. Hip-hip-hooray. To make the blues. Just go away. Entertain me.
ernold same,"Ernold Same awoke from the same dream. In the same bed. At the same time. Looked in the same mirror. Made the same frown. And felt the same way as he did every day. Then Ernold Same caught the same train. At the same station. Sat in the same seat. With the same nasty stain. Next to same old what's-his-name. On his way to the same place. With the same name. To do the same thing. Again and again and again. Poor old Ernold Same. Oh, Ernold Same. His world stays the same. Today will always be tomorrow. Poor old Ernold Same. He's getting that feeling once again. Nothing will change tomorrow."

In this town we all go to terminal pubs. It helps us sweat out those angry bits of life. From this town, the English Army grind their teeth into glass. You know you'll get a kicking tonight. Smell of puke and piss. Smell of puke and piss on your stilettos. Here comes that panic attack. My heart stops, then it starts. Give me a drink. I'll drink your round. I take you round the pole.

the puritan,"Are we institutionalised by the demands of today?. In our regalia are we Ok?. Because the flash of a blade is one less getting paid there. in the line. And the ice and gold, it's just a double code. It's a paradigm for every little thing that fashion gives you. So the Puritan on a Monday morning, said happy sad melody. I'm waltzing on an amazing pulse in a pornographic sea. Where the absent blade is one less in parade to throw overboard. And the ice and gold, it's just a double code. It's a metaphor for every little thing that fashion gives you. I'm falling into something that plays. upon the metronome in your heart. It's smoke and it's mirrors until the auto cue starts. Then the dry ice comes and we start sucking. our thumbs on the Tv. And the joy of people spirited away so merrily. It's part of every little thing that fashion gives you. Lalala la la lalala la la lalala la la lalalala lalalala. Hey Puritan. Whatcha gonna do about it?"

theme from an imaginary film,What if I told you I love you. What if I called you with rhyme. In this world there's nothing that's left. Well nothing that's new. What if I told you without you. Loving is limply a lie. Although she moves into the night. O tell me your mine. Please say it's true. O shame is over. I was the light and the days of them all. Well push me over. I'm flat on my back and having a ball. And just look who's laughing. What if I flew like a dove dear. What if I would you in rhythm. There's nothing left. Nothing that's good left for me now. O I'll just go and sleep with strangers. I'll live like a lord in a tower. 'Cos in the city there's too much air. That I can't dream at night. Well not anymore. O shame it's over. It been such fun and we had a ball. Well push me over. But I'll be the last of people to fall. Well just look who's laughing. O shame it's over. How like a cow bloated on grass. Well push me over. Me on my back and you on your arse. Such a shame it's all over. There are so few days left to grasp. So push me over. We on our back and you on your lazy arse. Well just look whose laughing.
there are too many of us,"There are too many of us. That's plain to see. We all believe in praying. For our immortality. We've posed these questions to our children. Across the mountain stream. And live in tiny houses. Of the same mistakes we've made. Cause there are too many of us. In tiny houses here and there. Passing out somewhere. But you won't care. There are too many of us. That's plain to see. We all believe in praying. For our immortality. For a moment I was dislocated. My terror on the loop, elsewhere. Flashing lights are vacating. On the big screens everywhere. There are too many of us. In tiny houses, here and there. All looking through the windows. On everything we share. We pose these questions to our children. Leave the mountain stream. And live in tiny houses. Of the same mistakes we make. There are too many of us. Oh, that's plain to see. All living in tiny houses. About our immortality"

this is a low,"And into the sea goes pretty england and me. Around the bay of biscay and back for tea. Hit traffic on the dogger bank. Up the thames to find a taxi rank. Sail on by with the tide and go asleep. And the radio says. (chorus). This is a low. But it won't hurt you. When you are alone it will be there with you. Finding ways to stay solo. On the tyne forth and cramity. There's a low in the high forties. And saturday's locked away on the pier. Not fast enough dear. On the malin head, blackpool looks blue and red. And the queen, she's gone round the bend. Jumped off land's end. (chorus x 3). ."

Shooting guns on the high street of love. In a crowd it’s hard to spot him. But anonymity can cost. He’s never cheap or cheerful. He’s Hugo and he’s Boss. He’s riding through the desert. On a Camel Light. And on a magic carpet. He’ll fly away tonight. Open sesame... T.O.P.M.A.N.. He sees her in double. Then pukes on the pavement. Likes her all clean and shaven. Shooting guns on the high street of love.

under the westway,"It was a bright day in my city today. Everything was sinking. Says snow would come on Sunday. The old school would do. And the traffic grew. Upon the Westway. Where I sat watching comets lonesome trails. Shining up above me. The jet fuel, it fell. Down to Earth. Where the money always comes first. And the sirens sing. So give us the day they switch off the machines. 'Cause men in yellow jackets. Putting adverts inside my dreams. And all the ladies saw. The whole world gone. Fallen under the spell. Of the distance between us when we comunicate. Still picking up shockwaves. Somewhere far out in space. It depends how you wive. When the heart's on fire. Under the Westway. Give me magic here in the city, the boat. Doing 180. Instead of standing although it's cold. And the flags coming down. The opals sound. Just like a love song. Far away, I feel about you. Paradise not lost it's in you. On the permanent races. I apologize. But I am gonna sing. Hallelujah. Singing out loud. And sing it to you all. Am I lost? Let me see. For the black falls burn. And wash me off the Westway"
under the westway (live at hyde park),"There were bright skies in my city today. Everything was sinking, said rain would come on Sunday. The old school was due. And the traffic grew, upon the Westway. Where I stood watching comets' lonesome trails. Shining up above me, the jet fuel it fell. Down to earth. Where the money always comes first. And the sirens sing. Bring us the day, they switch off the machines. 'Cause men in yellow jackets putting adverts. Inside my dreams. An automated song and the whole world gone. Fallen under the spell of the distance between us. When we communicate. Still picking up short wave. Somewhere they're out in space. It depends how you're wired,. When the night's on fire. Under the Westway. Now its magic arrows hitting the bull,. Doing 180 still standing at last call,. When the flags coming down,. And the last post sounds, just like a love song. For the way I feel about you. Paradise's not lost, it's in you. On a permanent basis I apologise. But I am going to sing. Hallelujah, singing out loud, and sing it to you. Am I lost out at sea, til a tide wash me up off the Westway"
villa rosie,"Practice doesn't make perfect whan you're interbreeding. Speaking drivel can it get confused with heavy breathing. Mixing drinks at water holes get snarled up in the suburbs. Meandering through this and that, you are suspected of vagueness. When work is done, go to Villa Rosie every night. So tasty. Go form a queue at Villa Rosie every night. So tasty. Across the common every day, you come across the fine line. But wearing boots can prevent the leeches in the long grass. Eating between meals stifles the appetite is it healthy. Coming home that nagging doubt there in your belly. And all the while at Villa Rosie every night. You're tasty. A sweeter life at Villa Rosie every night. So taste..... All this has come to Villa Rosie every night. They're waiting. So form a queue at Villa Rosie every night. So tasty. Don't break your own back at Villa Rosie every night. We're tasting. A sweeter life at Villa Rosie every night. So tasty."

when the cows come home,Good morning. Wake up. Wake up with purpose and polite efficiency. Stuff vitamin pills down your health guarantee. A kiss and cuddle with a lucky girl. You get fed and watered. Makes your hair curl. And when the day draws in. You put on a record. Put on something gentle. And wait for the cows to come home. Wake up a little voice says. To you eagerly. You mustn't let yourself sink financially. Don't listen to the accusation that you're tight. You could be the first man on your street to get it right. And when the day draws in. You going to go into waltz time. For once it was a good time. Wait for the cows to come home. All your life. Ha da de da da. Ha da de da da. Ha da da de da. Ha da de da da da. . Wake up with purpose and polite efficiency. So you get fed and watered with good company. And when the day draws in. You go into waltz time. For once it's a good time. Wait for the cows to come home. All your life.
where'd you go?,Where'd you go?. Dark eyed traveller. I almost feel you breathe. Where'd you go?. Dark eyed traveller. Can you even hear me speak?. You make things bright. When they took the night away. Led me inside and kissed all my tears away. Said you were here to stay. Where'd you go?. In the morning. When I was way down with dream. Where'd you go?. In the morning. When fever pulled me down stream. You made things bright. And you took the night away. Lend me your eyes and show me a brand new way. Now I just feel dead today..
who the fuck?,"I stole the bottle of gin from over the counter and ran,. I knew I'd been seen. I scarpered stifling giggles down. the street and hid round a corner on a side street.. I heard him huffing and the sound of his big feet against. the paving, he was getting close. As he rounded the corner. i sighted him up down the barrel of the gun and on seeing. his expression change to one of horror + confusuib jerked. back the trigger. His body was jolted back by the force of. the bullet + his feet flew foward. I saw a bright little rivulet. of blood are into the air and I slid the gin into the waistband. of my trousers.. . Who you fuckin lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?. . Is there really a thing like feeling too much?. Can you really escape + numb the real?. There's a way of saying, a way of sayin a shape - I feel a. certain shape and it's complicated it's not like a square or. a circle It's like crystal or diamond, it's clean, hard,. unfathomable and it ends in an augmental kiss. It ends in an augmental kiss. . Who the fuck you lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?. . Rock Stars are NOT cool. They're full of his guy they call satan,. Kids stuff oozing from their mouths.. They wear the shoes of dead soldiers shot by soldiers, valium. horses trotting squeezing through their rasberry blood.. Sometimes I feel so stoopid I wanna quit - get out of it cus. I hate this world and everyone in it - The fat Bald men who. run it - the fat bald men. . Who the fuck you lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?. Who the fuck you lookin at?."
won't do it,So much to be and so much to see. There's very little here for me. It's really hard to get through. So won't do it anymore. Don't feel it anymore. Won't do it anymore. Can't feel it. There's so much I'd like to say. You're not bothered either way. It's really hard to talk to you. So won't do it anymore. Don't do it anymore. Won't do it anymore. Can't feel it. So won't do it anymore. Don't feel it anymore. Won't do it anymore. Can't feel it. So won't do it anymore. Don't feel it anymore. Won't do it anymore. Can't feel it anymore. So won't do it anymore. Don't feel it anymore. Won't do it anymore. Can't feel it.

you're so great,"Sad, drunk and poorly. Sleepin' really late. Sad, drunk and poorly. Not feelin' so great. Wanderin' lost in a town full of frowns. Sad, drunk and poorly. Dog's diggin' up the ground. And I feel the light in the night and in the day. And I feel the light when the sky's just mild and grey. And I feel the light when you tell me it's okay ... Cos you're so great and I love you. G.T. And coffee. Helps to start the day. G.T. And coffee. Shake it all the way. City's alive, and surprise, so am i. Tea, tea and coffee. Got no sleep today. And I feel alive in the night and in the day. And I feel alive when the sky's just mild and grey. And I feel alive when you tell me it's okay. Cos you're so great and I love you"
young and lovely,"Friday's child is planning to go out for the first time. Says. Don't worry Mum. I won't be out that late. Done me playing those passive games right now. They're out of date. You're awfully sweet. Haven't got the time. Growing up so fast. Got better things to do. You can get what you want. So young and lovely. Kicking around in the centre of the town. Looking in shop windows. Those mannequins. Look far too real at night. Friday's child doesn't know if it's awake. Or if it's dreaming. Says. Don't worry Dad. I'll do my bit. I'll raise the flag. I'll be just like you. You can get what you want. So young and lovely. Don't worry Mum. I'm not that dumb. I'll be just like you. Oh, no, why. Why d'you do it?."
yuko and hiro,This is my work place. And these are the people. I work with. Yuko and Hiro. We work together. We work for the company. That looks to the future. We work hard to please them. They will protect us. I never see you. We're never together. I'll love you forever. I drink in the evenings. It helps with relaxing. I can't sleep without drinking. We drink together. From Monday to Saturday. I go to my workplace. But on Sunday. We're together. Yuko and Hiro.
