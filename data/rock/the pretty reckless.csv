waiting for a friend,"The night is when the ghosts all come out. Playing with my head,. spin it all around. This room is like a prison cell, I'm all by myself. I'm waiting for my friend to come and break me out. You left me today lying on the floor. I wanted you to stay,. it seems you wanted it more. This bed is like a prison cell,. cause I'm all by myself. Still waiting for my friend to come and break me out. And there's stone cold bars on my door. for this stone cold heart. Some people say life is like a ride. Take it day by day, never knowing why. My head is like a prison cell, I'm all by myself. I'm waiting for my friend to come and break me out. Still waiting for my friend to come and break me out"
where did jesus go?,"I have a tale to tell. about a girl whose soul was screwed. She was born into a life with everything to lose. Her father sold her to the trade when she was just a child. She was seventeen and never ever learned to smile. She took a bullet and she blew out her brains. She didn't say goodbye, she just went away. And now who's missing her?. I wish she was here. Her name was Angel and she'd had a bad year. So you wanna call me the devil's advocate. When you don't know the half of it?. 'Cause I was raised to believe in miracles. My life is so cold. Where did Jesus go?. Where did Jesus go?. Where did Jesus go?. He disappeared. Where did Jesus go?. Where did Jesus go?. Where did Jesus go?. He disappeared. What's the point of screaming out if no one gives a damn?. What's the point of reaching out if no one lends a hand?. She had passed the point where there was nothing left to give. She was seventeen and never ever learned to live. So if you wanna call me the devil's advocate. Well you don't know the half of it. 'Cause I was raised to believe in miracles. My life is so cold. Where did Jesus go?. Where did Jesus go?. Where did Jesus go?. He disappeared. Where did Jesus go?. Where did Jesus go?. Where did Jesus go?. He disappeared. She needed an angel to love. And no one sent her an angel. She needed an angel to love her. But no one sent her an angel. But you wanna call me the devil's advocate. But you don't know the half of it. I hate I was raised to believe in miracles. 'Cause life is so cold. And if you wanna call me the devil's advocate. But you don't know the half of it. I hate I was raised to believe in miracles.

who you selling for,"In the middle of a dream. On the darkest night. Woke up in a scream. Thought I'd lost my sight. Who you selling for tonight?. Pack my bags, time to fly. Don't be sad. I'm not that high. Who you selling for tonight?. Who you selling for tonight?. Who you selling for tonight?. Who you selling for?. Tonight it's alright. I can see the tunnel at the end of these lights. And when Travis called I didn't even answer. John was a walrus but he ain't no dancer like Paul. Know it all. And when Roger showed me I was building a wall. I've been waiting a long time. Waiting a long time. Waiting a long time. Waiting for it to fall. Who you selling for tonight?. Who you selling for tonight?. In the middle of a dream. On the darkest night. Or so it seems. But I think I'm right"
why'd you bring a shotgun to the party,"Alone, afraid, the kid your mother made. Sittin' in your room drooling like a loser. With all this doom. You think, then you start to drink. Then you get so paranoid. With all the drugs they fill you with (then boom). Does it make you feel like a man? (boom). It's not the size we understand (boom). You think you're gonna get with me. You're never gonna get with me. You're never gonna dance with me. I admit, I feel like you, like shit. But I don't go out and take it out on everyone about it. We're all part of the system.

wild city,"It's that time of the season. When the blood runs hot. And God must have a reason. When the temperature drops. One more nameless baby. And a momma in shame. Not one of the fathers. Of the churches came. For a motherless child in the wild, wild city. It ain't no place for a girl. So young and pretty. A motherless child in the wild, wild city. Cause the city ain't no place for a lonely girl. It could happen to me. It could happen to you. It's the luck of the draw. It's the blow of the dice. There ain't nothin' that you can do. She took too many daddies. Took too many home. Tryna find the one, someone else's son. She couldn't weather those streets alone. For a motherless child in the wild, wild city. It ain't no place for a girl. So young and pretty. A motherless child in the wild, wild city. Cause the city ain't no place for a lonely girl. For a motherless child in the wild, wild city. It ain't no place for a girl. So young and pretty. A motherless child in the wild, wild city. Cause the city ain't no place, no no. The city ain't no place, no no. The city ain't no place for a lonely girl"

zombie,"I'm not listening to you. I am wandering right through existence. With no purpose and no drive. 'Cause in the end we're all a lie, a lie. Two thousand years I've been awake. Waiting for the day to shake. Dear all of you who've wronged me,. I'm, I'm a zombie. Again, again you want me to fall on my head. I'm, I'm, I'm a zombie. How low, how low, how low will you push me. To go, to go, to go, before I lie, lie down dead. Blow the smoke right off the tube. Kiss my gentle burning bruise. I'm lost in time. And to all the people left behind. You are walking dumb and blind, blind. And two thousand years I've been awake. Waiting for the day to shake. Dear all of you who've wronged me. I'm, I'm a zombie. Again, again you want me to fall on my head. I'm, I'm, I'm a zombie. How low, how low, how low will you push me. To go, to go, to go, before I lay, lay down dead. Oh dead, Oh dead, Oh dead. Dear all of you who've wronged me. I'm, I'm a zombie. Again, again you want me to fall on my head. I'm I'm I'm a zombie. How low, how low, how low will you push me. To go, to go, to go, before I lie down dead"
