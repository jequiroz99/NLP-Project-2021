fire,"I am the god of hell f ire and I bring you:. Fire, I'll take you to burn.. Fire, I'll take you to learn.. I'll see you burn!. You fought hard and you saved and learned,. but all of it's going to burn.. And your mind, your tiny mind,. you know you've really been so blind.. Now 's your time burn your mind.. You're falling far too far behind.. Oh no, oh no, oh no, you gonna burn!. Fire, to destroy all you've done.. Fire, to end all you've become.. I'll feel you burn!. You've been living like a little girl,. in the middle of your little world.. And your mind, your tiny mind,. you know you've really been so blind.. Now 's your time burn your mind,. you're falling far too far behind."
nightmare,"Dynamic explosions in my brain. Shattered me to drops of rain. Falling from a yellow sky. Orange faces to an opened eye. Stop me. Hold me back as I jerk. Stop me. Voices from all those at work. Lips don't want t√¥ criticize, you know. Eyes can never tell you lies. It's the words. Take that fire, bring me my brain. Let me love it higher. Why is it so cold out here? (So cold!). Let me in. The price of your entry is sin. Go away, then return. Know which face you have to turn. Eyes are glaring, voices flaring. Why?. Caught up deep inside, beneath my brain. Take my love and turn it to pain. Take my heart and tear it apart. Gonna burn in our desire. Why?. Why?"
