relentless game,"Spent my living. Feeling blue. Full of boundaries. Like I was tought to. Spent my living. On my own. Feeling sorry. For what I've become. Catatonic. White blank page. No aim, no goal. Walking in a maze. And I kept going. Like a fool. Faking cool lines. Like I had a clue. Now I'm walking. In my own shoes. Down the path that. Life's forced me to. Then I could see. My future-self. Caring no more. 'Bout this living hell. Break me, take me. Relentless game. Cause I'm not the one. I was before and now I claim to. Live and die among the rest. Break me, take me. Relentless game. Off the chains I go. Release my soul and drown myself. In tides of what is truly new. The world's weight on my back. And I'm not going back home. In my journey I craft. The love, the joys of tomorrow (I'm not going back home)"
the sun also rises,"Its kind of hard to wish you well. But its kind of hard to wish you not. Play you cards, but play them well. Cause I know this game of yours its poison. We have been wrong when saying we. Are just another ship thats been off shore. Cause Id say through all the storms. We have managed to turn into something more. And like old times, we should not care. About others say or do, cause in the end. My poison is you. How long can we keep on living like this?. How long?. But like old times, we should not care. About others say or do, cause in the end. My poison is you"
