I'm burning inside, I'm waiting for you. Set me on fire, set me on fire. Your hand in mine, oh. I feel the fire. Two hearts that beat, oh, to feed the fire. You are a spark that shines a light where we could. Belong together, factionless. Let's keep it burning bright 'til we're floating. Away, 'til we're ashes dancing inside the flames. Now I feel the fear rising up. Climbing up, taking over my body. And I feel my pulse starting up. Waking me again. Open my eyes, I'm reaching for you. Set me on fire, set me on fire.

Savoring this heart that's healing. My hands float up above me. And you whisper you love me. And I begin to fade. Into our secret place. The music makes me sway. The angels singing say we are alone with you. I am alone and they are too with you. I'm still alive, I'm still alive, we still alive. I can feel you all around me. Thickening the air I'm breathing. Holding on to what I'm feeling. Savoring this heart that's healing. And so I cry. The light is white. Holy. And I see you. I'm alive, I'm still alive, we still alive. I can feel you all around me.

The idle words forsake me and I am left to face me. I'm held accountable. For every idle word. Curse the idle words. I'm scared to death of light and silence. Jesus kill me inside this. Raise me up to live again. Like you did, like you did.. Glory shows up. Exposes us. I'm naked here. Forsaken here, by the dark, by the dark. I'm scared to death of light and silence. Jesus kill me in side this. Raise me up to live again. Like you did. Like you did.. by S15"
so i thought,All your twisted thoughts free flow to. Everlasting memories show soul. Kiss the stars with me. And dread the wait for. Stupid calls returning us to life. We say to those who are in love. It can't be true cause we're too young. I know that's true because. So long I was so in love with you. So I thought. A year goes by. And I can't talk about it. On my knees in a dim lighted room. Thoughts free flow try to consume myself in this. I'm not faithless. Just paranoid. Of getting lost or that I might lose. Ignorance is bliss cherish it. Pretty neighborhoods. You learn too much to hold. Believe and not. And fight the tears. With pretty smiles and lies about the time. A year goes by. And I can't talk about it. The times weren't right. And I couldn't talk about it. Choris romance says goodnight. Close your eyes and I'll close mine. Remember you remember me. Choris romance says goodnight. Close your eyes and I'll close mine.

beautiful bride,"Unified diversity. Functioning as one body. Every part encouraged by the other. No one independent of another. You're irreplaceable, indispensable. You're incredible. You're incredible. (Chorus). Beautiful bride. Body of Christ. One flesh abiding. Strong and unifying. Fighting ends in forgiveness. Unite and fight all division. Beautiful bride.

Now screams of joy. Victory. Chorus x 2. We're not gonna fall and forget. How far You went to pick us up. If one part's hurt the whole body's sick. If one part mourns we all mourn with Him. Rejoice, we'll sing with you. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah"
believe in dreams,"I know, the days will come and go,. But baby I’ll grow old, but I will die.. For now, is it worth it to be sad, if it's harder to be glad to be alive?. For the trouble I have caused. I wonder,. Where do I belong?. Is it here?. Believe in dreams you love so much,. Let the passion of your hearts make them real-. And tell all the ones you love,. Anything and everything you feel.. I laugh about the past-. Secretly,. Wish we could go back,. And save the child.... As I look around this room,. See the worried eyes I know. It’s time I cannot buy. Was this worth the time to rise?. Was this worth the time to rise?. Believe in dreams. I believe in dreams. I believe in dreams. I believe in you. Believe in dreams you love so much,. Let the passion of your hearts make them real. And tell all the ones you love,. Anything and everything you feel…. Believe in dreams. Believe in dreams…"

cage on the ground,Another dreamer steps onto the stage. He sings his hope and his fear and his rage. As the applause from the crowd start to fade. He hears them swallow the key to his cage. Welcome to the machine. It's a currency generator. And then it's a guillotine. A mirror held up to your own behavior. I'm gonna take my bow. And disappear into the sound. I'm leaving my cage on the ground. When I take my bow. I'm watching it burn to the ground. See my feet flying up through the clouds. The dreamer dances inside of his cage. All his music and words are the same. But in the moment he exits the stage. You hear him whisper a prayer for the flames. Welcome to the machine. It's a currency generator. And then it's a guillotine. A mirror held up to your own behavior. I'm gonna take my bow. And disappear into the sound. I'm leaving my cage on the ground. When I take my bow. I'm watching it burn to the ground. See my feet flying up through the clouds. When they distinguish your name. It may extinguish your flame. I'm gonna take my bow. And disappear into the sound. I'm leaving my cage on the ground. When I take my bow. I'm watching it burn to the ground. See my feet flying up through the clouds. One day distinguish your name.

christmas song,A frightened virgin teenage girl. Receives a message that defies the laws of this world. All she can do is weep and nod. She's to bring into this world the Son of God. God's angels sound their trumpets. And blow their horns. Tonight the long awaited savior is to be born. The goodness bound by Satan it has been torn. With this baby's precious brow ready for thorns. A star appears fufilling ancient prophecy. There's an ounce of fear as wise men follow faithfully. The Virgin Mary brings forth the human savior. And this future king sleeps soundly in the manger. Soundly in the manger. God's angels sound their trumpets. And blow their horns. Tonight the long awaited savior is to be born. The goodness bound by Satan it has been torn. With this baby's precious brow ready for thorns. Tonight He is born so one day He can die. To heal hearts that are torn and live the perfect life. So He hang upon a cross and we can take His life. So we can live as sinners. And He can pay the price. Tonight He is born so one day he can die. But He will rise again. God's angels sound their trumpets. And blow their horns. Tonight the long awaited savior is to be born. The goodness bound by Satan it has been torn. With this baby's precious brow ready for thorns
circle,"Circle encircles the earth. Chance and choice break his heart. His innocent arm moves to save me and I, I am spared. His beautiful arm is bloody and cut off. His heart ripped out to show me he loved me. But I wouldn't believe him. He did all that he could. Still would not believe him. Woah, I left his arms empty and tied. Outstretched for me until he died. Left his arms empty and tied. Outstretched for me until he died. No man shows greater love. Than when a man lays down his life. For his beloved. I left his arms empty and tied outstretched until he died. Left his arms empty and tied outstretched until he died. Ande here I am alive. And I don't have the right. But he gave me the right. Costing him his life. New mercies in the morning. I believe! what if I believe you? Now oh. Could it ever change this harrow. Forgive me, relieve me, please come back to life.

city kids,"Walking through the city we grew up in. Everything is changed again. I remember fighting to believe in. Truth and how the good will win. When we were young, almost in love. Too scared to reach out for what was. Walking past the house that you grew up in. Man, it looks so different now. Remembering the story of your first kiss. The feeling of my heart ripped out. When we were young, almost in love. Too scared to reach out for what was. Looking back, we try to laugh. City kids, the ghosts of past. When you were just a girl you wrote a letter. It said that we were dearest friends. I push myself to read a little further. It said we would be 'til we're dead. But we were young, almost in love. Too scared to reach out for what was.

Let go of my hand. This is the sober serenade. I won't be the one who knows you. Let go of my hand. This is the sober serenade. I won't be the one, won't be the one. Let go of my hand.
