is this love?,"I should have known better. Than to let you go alone. It's times like these I can't make it on my own. Wasted days and sleepless night. And I can't wait to see you again. I find I spend my time waiting on your call. How can I tell you baby,. my back's against the wall. I need you by my side to tell me it's all right. 'Cause I don't think I can take anymore. (chorus). Is this love that I'm feeling. Is this the love that I've been searching for. Is this love or am I dreaming. This must be love. 'Cause it's really got a hold on me. A hold on me. I can't stop this feeling. I've been this way before. But with you I've found the key. to open any door. I can feel my love for you. Growing stronger day by day. And I can't wait to see you again. So I can hold you in my arms. (chorus). Is this love that I'm feeling. Is this the love that I've been searching for. *Is this love or am I dreaming. Is this the love that I've been searching for. *repeat"
here i go again,"No I don't know where I'm going. But I sure know where I've been. Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday. And I've made up my mind. I ain't wasting no more time.. Here I go again, here I go again. Though I keep searching for an answer. I never seem to find what I'm looking for. Oh Lord I pray you give me strength to carry on. 'Cause I know what it means. To walk along the lonely street of dreams. And here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known. Like a drifter I was born to walk alone. But I've made up my mind. I ain't wasting no more time. Just another heart in need of rescue. Waiting on love's sweet charity. And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days. 'Cause I know what it means. To walk along the lonely street of dreams. And here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known. Like a drifter I was born to walk alone. And I've made up my mind. I ain't wasting no more time. But here I go again. Here I go again. Here I go again. Oh baby, oh yeah. And I've made up my mind. Oh baby. And wasted no more time. And here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known. Like a drifter I was born to walk alone. 'Cause I know what it means. To walk along the lonely street of dreams"

don't fade away,"(Coverdale/Vandenberg). As I stand at the crossroad,. I see the sun sinking low.... With my cross of indecision,. I can't tell which way to go.... Now I have seen the seven wonders. And I have sailed the seven seas,. I've walked and talked with angels,. And danced all night with gypsy queens.... All in all it's been a rocky road,. Twists and turns along the way.... But, I still pray for tomorrow,. All my hopes, my dreams. Don't fade away... Don't fade away.... I have painted many portraits,. Memories of love and pain,. Though cut down by life's deceptions. I found the strength to start again.... All in all it's been a rocky road,. Twists and turns along the way.... But, I still pray for tomorrow,. All my hopes, my dreams. Don't fade away... Don't fade away.. Heaven help a man. Trying to make up his mind,. With the darkness closing in,. I feel I'm running out of time.... Shine a light for me,. Help me find the way to go,. And take me where I've never been before.... And so I stand at the crossroad,. Watching the sun sinking low.... With my cross of indecision,. Trying to find the way to go.... All in all it's been a rocky road,. Twists and turns along the way,. But, I still pray for tomorrow. All my hopes, my dreams. Don't fade away.... ."

sailing ships,"(Coverdale/Vandenberg). Do you remember. Standing on the shore,. Head in the clouds,. Your pockets filled with dreams. Bound for glory. On the seven seas of life,. But, the ocean is deeper than it seems. The wind was with you. When you left on the morning tide,. You set your sails for an island in the sun,. But n the horizon, there are dark clouds up ahead,. And the storm has just begun. So take me with you,. Take me far away,. Lead me to the distant shore. Sail your ship across the water,. Spread your wings across the sky. Take the time to see. You're the one who holds the key,. Or sailing ships will pass you by. You cry for mercy,. When you think you've lost your way,. You drift alone, if all your hope is gone. So find the strength and you will see. You control your destiny,. After all is said and done. So take me with you,. Take me far away,. An' lead me to the distant shore. Sail your ship across the water,. Spread your wings across the sky. Take the time to see. You're the one who holds the key,. Or sailing ships will pass,. Sailing ships will pass you,. Sailing ships will pass you by.... Take me with you,. Take me far away,. We'll ride the wind across the sky. Spread your wings and you will see. You control, your destiny,. So sailing ships don't pass you by"

woman trouble blues,"(Coverdale/Vandenberg). The womans name was trouble,. She put the blame on me. I asked her what her game was,. She said ""Misery"". I didn't ask no questions,.

Nobody listens to a word I say,. Still I'm gonna curse you, woman,. 'Til my dying day. I should have known better. With a girl like you. You shame the devil. With the things you do. I was blind, now I see. A lying woman be the death of me. I got woman trouble blues,. Woman trouble blues. You told me it was meant to be,. But, all you did was put the hurt on me. You made my life a living hell,. And drowned my dreams in the wishing well. I've got woman trouble blues,. Woman trouble blues. There ain't no doubt I'm going down. The womans name was trouble,. She put the blame on me,. I gave her what she wanted. And I got misery. Now I don't take much persuading,. At times I'm easily led,. I'm gonna find myself in a prison cell.

I realise, I'm crying.... Crying... I'm crying. Bitter tears falling like rain.... Lies.... I can never understand,. You play your cards under the table,. Dealing me a losing hand.... Tears of rage, tears of pain,. Burning my eyes,. I realise, I'm crying. Crying... I'm crying. Bitter tears falling like rain.... Crying, always crying, crying. Bitter tears falling like rain.... I want to be there. When your demons come to call.... I'm gonna finish what you started, baby,. Watch you burn little house down,. Burn it down, down, down.... Then I'll see you crying,. Crying... Crying.... Bitter tears falling like rain...."

child of babylon,"(Coverdale/Marsden). When I heard the sound of thunder. On the day that I was born,. I was blinded by the lighting. An' baptised in the storm. My father started crying. When he saw what he had done,. But, my mother started praying. Have mercy on my son,. He is a child of Babylon. I am a child of Babylon,. Lord have mercy on a wayward son. Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run. I am a child,. A child of Babylon. When I've fooled around so many times. When I've known it ain't been right,. But, I paint it all in colours. When it really should be black and white. I sail my ship through muddy waters,. Try to open every door,. When I saw the seven wonders. It left me wanting more. I am a child of Babylon,. Lord have mercy on a wayward son. Nowhere to hide, got no place to run. I am a child,. A child of Babylon. On my day of judgement. I know how it will be,. I'm prepared to meet my maker. With no hope for charity. I'll stand alone and pay the price. For everything I've done,. 'Cos there ain't guardian angel. For a child of Babylon. I am a child,. A child of Babylon. I am a child of Babylon,. Lord have mercy on a wayward son. Nowhere to hide, got no place to run. I am a child,. A child of Babylon. Child of Babylon."

Making enemies of desire. Sufocated all the fire. But still I miss your sweet breathe. Your kisses on my face. And all the love is gone. The memory lingers on. But it's alright. I'll be there one of these days. And leave it all behind, in one of these days. But it's alright. I'll be there one of these days. And leave the past behind, in one of these days.

Chasin' round with all you see. I'm gonna make you live to regret it. You fool no one. Waiting to see if I'm gone. So clear to see. You've had all your chances with me. You thought that you could take me for granted. But I couldn't take it no more. Better run when you see me comin'
you keep on moving,You keep on moving. Far away far away. You keep on moving. Far away far away. Everyday wheels are turning. And the cry still returning. Dawn will soon be breaking.

The day has just begun. You put your arms around me. Like a circle 'round the sun. Dance across the seasons. To a place that no one knows. Where angels fear to tread. You keep on moving. Far away far away. Everyday wheels are turning. And the cry still returning. Dawn will soon be breaking. The day has just begun. You put your arms around me. Like a circle 'round the sun. Dance across the seasons. To a place that no one knows. Where angels fear to tread
