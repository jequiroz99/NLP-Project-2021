silver,Swung from a chandelier. My planet sweet on a silver salver. Bailed out my worst fears. 'Cause man has to be his own saviour. Blind sailors. Imprisoned jailers. God tame us. No one to blame us. The sky is blue. My hands untied. A world that's true. Through our clean eyes. Just look at you. With burning lips. You're living proof. At my fingertips. Walked on a tidal wave. Laughed in the face of a brand new day. Food for survival thought. Mapped out the place where I planned to stay. All the way. Well behaved. Just in case. It slips away. The sky is blue. My hands untied. A world that's true. Through our clean eyes. Just look at you. With burning lips. You're living proof. At my fingertips. La la la la la la la la la la la la la.

all that jazz,"Where the hell have you been. We've been waiting with our best suits on. Hair slicked back and all that jazz. Rolling down the Union Jack. See you at the barricades babe. See you when the lights go low, Joe. Hear you when the wheels turn round. Someday when the sky turns black. It appears because it's what I feel. I know I don't understand. If you ask you know I don't mind kneeling. But when my knees hurt I like to stand. Instinct is the common lawyer. A million years won't erase. Strike the chord I'm searching for. Call it a committed race. No matter how I shake my fist. I know I can't resist it. No matter how you shake your fist. You know you can't resist it. See you at the barricades babe. See you when the lights go low, Joe. Hear you when the wheels turn round. Someday when the sky turns black"
angels and devils,"Call it a day. When night becomes our mad escape. Forgetting the things you mean to say. When all the right words come too late. And everything falls out of place under the pillow. Out of the race, out of the window. Devils on my shoulder. So, so happy. When happiness spells misery. Mister me hoping to be. Where ugliness meets beauty. And if you'll see the demon in you, the angel in me. The Jesus in you, the Devil in me. Angels on my shoulder. Call it a day. When night becomes our mad escape. Forgetting the things you mean to say. When all the right words come too late. And everything falls out of place under the pillow. Out of the race, out of the window. Devils on my shoulder. So, so happy. When happiness spells misery. And mister me hoping to be. Where ugliness meets beauty. And if you'll see the demon in you, the angel in me. The Jesus in you, the Devil in me. The demon in you, the Devil's in me. Devils on my shoulder. Angels coming closer"
baby rain,Lost again. Still waiting for the voices. That don't call my name. Had too many choices. And I missed my aim. No pearls inside the oysters. . Just a world. With no answers. We all get life. And take our chances. . In the rain...baby rain. In the rain...baby rain. . Glad to be. Alive and still believing. What you said to me. Your love was never leaving. And it comes for free. So what's the use of stealing. . From your girl. When she's the answer. And your world. And your chances. . In the rain...baby rain. In the rain...baby rain. . I've got what you want. When're you going to get me?. . Home again. I can hear the voices. Singing out my name. Life is where the choice is. And I've found my aim. Don't need pearls or oysters. . Just a world. With all the answers. I've got life. I'll take my chances. . In the rain...baby rain. In the rain...baby rain

drivetime,"DRIVETIME. If we ride ride ride. Rider come on to the other side. Floating and floating on the night tide. Just beyond where the sun dies. If we fly fly fly. Fly with me now over oceans wide. Higher than heaven, higher than the sky. You, me and God can watch the sun rise. Drivetime. On the drivetime. Driving by. If we ride ride ride. Where the mist takes us. In a rising tide. Makes us and breaks us there’s no-one to guide. Spirits following the blind. If we fly fly fly. Will it take us up too high-high. A prayer and no wings just a why why?. We can’t see the skyline for the sky. Drivetime. On the drivetime. Driving by"

forgotten fields,"In the tree-lined cities and forgotten fields. Some are born too pretty, some are born too real. Some to death-wish pity, while the selfish steal some ground.

And we all fell down. we were lost and found. and the sun went down. we were lost and found. repeat chorus to fade."

And then take me home again. . Just when you thing it's over. Just when you think it's done. Out of every nowhere. You never see it come. I know the lines are showing. I can't keep them in. Like everybody's story. It's written on the skin. . Give me one last try. And I'll make it up to you. Wish that you were here. Wish that I was true. [Chorus]. I wish that you were here. Down amongst my dust. I need someone to help me. You need someone to trust. There's something with these tears. Turning me to rust. I wish that you were here. I wish that it was ours. [Chorus]. ...

seven seas,Seven Seas. Stab a sorry heart. With your favourite finger. Paint the whole world blue. And stop your tears from stinging. Hear the cavemen singing. Good news they're bringing. Seven seas.

And something's all we can do. With a hip hip hop and a flip flap flop. Gonna steal some bananas from the grocer's shop. With your head in the clouds. And your trousers undone. Gonna shit on the carpet. Just like everyone. Chorus:. This is the one for the money. This is the one for the trees. This is the one called heaven. And this is the one for me. You've yet to discover. discover the difference. The difference between moral and mortal. They've got it and I have some. I couldn't handle it but I have some. Hold it in the light. And see right through it. For god's sake make a decision. Take it for a walk. And hold it hold it. Pin it on the wall and fasten onto. Move to the back. And oh yes oh yes. Do what must be done. And don't say maybe. (Chorus)"
zephyr,"Can you be the one. To help me understand myself. The one and only one. Is it you and no one else. . Can you shoot the veins. That others only dream about. Can you light the fire. When all my flames are dying out. . Can you be the one. Can you be the one. Can you be the one. Can you be the one. . Tell me about my life. Tell me about my world. Tell me about your life. Tell me about your world. . __________ the crowd. Aim above and out beyond. Leave the common ground. You never wanted to belong. . The sky is open wide. Light the fuse and take a ride. Leave it all behind. Dig in deep and push aside. . You know you're the one. You know you're the one. You know you're the one. You know you're the one. . Tell me about my life. Tell me about my world. Tell me about your life. Tell me about your world. . Shoot them down. They want to drag you down. Got to see. They're your enemies. . Shoot them down. They want to drag you down. Got to see. They're your enemies. . Listen, you can't even see. What this world has done to me. Done to me. Done to me. . Can you be the one. To help me understand myself. The one and only one. Is it you and no one else. . Can you shoot the veins. That others only dream about. Can you light the fire. When all my flames are dying out. . Can you be the one. Can you be the one. Can you be the one. Can you be the one. . Tell me about my life. Tell me about my world. Tell me about your life. Tell me about your world. . Tell me about my life. Tell me about my world. Tell me about your life. Tell me about your world. . Tell me about my world. Tell me about my world. Tell me about my world"
