So we run. I've been thinking about the West Coast. Not the one that everyone knows. I'm sick of living in the shadows. We have one more chance before the light goes. For a summer of love. A summer of love. Oh and when all is lost. When all is lost we find out what remains. Oh the same oceans crossed. The suns pleasure. The sun it's pink. I've been thinking about the West Coast. Not the one that everyone knows. In the rubble of Aleppo. Flowers blooming in the shadows. For a summer of love. A summer of love

And there is a light. Don't let it go out. When the wind screams and shouts. And the sea is a dragon's tail. And the ship that stole your heart away. Sets sail. When all you've left is leaving. And all you got is grieving. And all you know is needing. If there is a light. We can't always see. If there is a world. We can't always be. If there is a dark. Now we shouldn't doubt. And there is a light. Don't let it go out. 'Cause this is a song. A song for someone. Someone like me. I know the world is done. But you don't have to be. I've got a question. For the child in you before it leaves. Are you tough enough to be kind?. Do you know your heart has its own mind?. Darkness gathers around the light. Hold on. Hold on. There is a light. We can't always see. If there is a world. We can't always be. If there is a dark. That we shouldn't doubt. And there is a light. Don't let it go out. And this is a song. A song for someone. This is a song. A song for someone. Someone like me. Someone like me. Someone like me

a man and a woman,"Little sister don’t you worry about a thing today. Take the heat from the sun. Little sister. I know that everything is not ok. But you’re like honey on my tongue. True love never can be rent. But only true love can keep beauty innocent. I could never take a chance. Of losing love to find romance. In the mysterious distance. Between a man and a woman. No I could never take a chance. ‘Cos I could never understand. The mysterious distance. Between a man and a woman. You can run from love. And if it’s really love it will find you. Catch you by the heel. But you can’t be numb for love. The only pain is to feel nothing at all. How can I hurt when I’m holding you?. I could never take a chance. Of losing love to find romance. In the mysterious distance. Between a man and a woman. And you’re the one, there’s no-one else. You make me want to lose myself. In the mysterious distance. Between a man and a woman. Brown eyed girl across the street. On rue Saint Divine. I thought this is the one for me. But she was already mine. You were already mine…. Little sister. I’ve been sleeping in the street again. Like a stray dog. Little sister. I’ve been trying to feel complete again. But you’re gone and so is God. The soul needs beauty for a soul mate. When the soul wants… the soul waits …. No I could never take a chance. Of losing love to find romance. In the mysterious distance. Between a man and a woman. For love and faith and sex and fear. And all the things that keep us here. In the mysterious distance. Between a man and a woman. How can I hurt when I’m holding you?"
a room at the heartbreak hotel,". From where I stand. I can see through you. From where you're sitting pretty one. I know it got to you.. I see the stars in your eyes. You say you want the truth but you need the lies. Like Judy Garland, like Valentino. You give your life for rock'n'roll.. Stand, we're on a landslide of love. You got everything you want. But what you need you give away. For primitive love and a ride on a mystery train. A primitive love.. A room at the heart, the heartbreak hotel.. A room at the heartbreak, heartbreak hotel.. You say it's love, it's not the money. You let them suck your life out like honey. Turning tricks you're on the street. Selling your kisses so bittersweet.. For primitive love and a ride on a mystery train. A primitive love. A room at the heartbreak, heartbreak hotel.. ."
a sort of homecoming,"And you know it's time to go. Through the sleet and driving snow. Across the fields of mourning to a light that's in the distance.. And you hunger for the time. Time to heal, 'desire' time. And your earth moves beneath your own dream landscape.. On borderland we run.. I'll be there, I'll be there tonight. A high-road, a high-road out from here.. The city walls are all come down. The dust a smoke screen all around. See faces ploughed like fields that once. Gave no resistance.. And we live by the side of the road. On the side of a hill as the valleys explode. Dislocated, suffocated. The land grows weary of it's own.. O com-away, o com-away, o-com, o com-away, I say I. O com-away, o com-away, o-com, o com-away, I say I. Oh, oh on borderland we run. And still we run, we run and don't look back. I'll be there, I'll be there. Tonight, tonight. I'll be there tonight, I believe. I'll be there so high. I'll be there tonight, tonight.. Oh com-away, I say, o com-away, I say.. The wind will crack in winter time. This bomb-blast lightning waltz.. No spoken words, just a scream. Tonight we'll build a bridge across the sea and land. See the sky, the burning rain. She will die and live again tonight.. And your heart beats so slow. Through the rain and fallen snow. Across the fields of mourning to a light that's in the distance.. Oh, don't sorrow, no don't weep. For tonight at last I am coming home.. I am coming home.. ."

Walk out into the street. Sing your heart out. The people we meet. Will not be drowned out. There's nothing you have that I need. I can breathe. Breathe now. Yeah, yeah. We are people born of sound. The songs are in our eyes. Gonna wear them like a crown. Walk out, into the sunburst street. Sing your heart out, sing my heart out. I've found grace inside a sound.

I have your face in an old polaroid. Tidying the children's clothes and toys. You're smiling back at me, took the photo from the. fridge. Can't remember whatever we did. Haven't been with a woman, it feels like it's been. years. Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears. This shitty world sometimes produces a rose. The scent of it lingers but then it just goes.

I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home.. Child drinkin' dirty water from the riverbank. Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank. Waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come. Watching the sun go down in Lebanon. Return the call to home.. I got a head like a lit cigarette.. Unholy clouds reflecting a minaret. You're so high above me, higher than everyone. Where are you in the Cedars of Lebanon?. Choose your enemies carefully 'cause they will define you. Make them interesting, 'cause in some ways they will mind you. They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends. Gonna last with you longer than your friends"
cedarwood road,"I was running down the road. The fear was all I knew. I was looking for a soul that's real. Then I ran into you. And that cherry blossom tree. Was a gateway to the sun. And friendship once it's won. It's won - it's one. Northside just across the river to southside. That's a long way here. All the green and all the gold. The hurt you hide, the joy you hold. The foolish pride that gets you out the door. Up on cedarwood road, on cedarwood road. Sleepwalking down the road. Not waking from those dreams. 'cause it's never dead it's still in my head. It was a warzone in my teens. I'm still standing on that street. Still need an enemy. The worst ones I can't see. You can? you can. Northside just across the river to southside. That's a long way here. All the green and all the gold. The hurt you hide, the joy you hold. The foolish pride that sends you back for more. Up on cedarwood road, on cedarwood road. If the door is open it isn't theft. You can't return to where you've never left. Blossoms falling from a tree they cover you and cover me. Symbols clashing, bibles smashing. Paint the world you need to see. Sometimes fear is the only place. we can call home. Cedarwood road. A heart that is broken. Is a heart that is open"

Smelled the spring on the smoky wind. Dirty old town. Dirty old town. I'm going to make me a good sharp axe. Shining steel tempered in the fire. Will chop you down like an old dead tree. Dirty old town. Dirty old town
disappearing act,"You do your disappearing act. You do your disappearing act. Silence, I know I could get used to this. Cunning, your sin is something I'm not gonna miss. Exile, it's a small price to pay for bliss. Alone, like the painter's dog without a bone. When there's only one thing you need to own. And that is hunger, hunger itself. I know you'll be convinced. Your mattress ripped, and it is torn to shreds. From all the lovers taken to your beds. They're empty now. And you think that you can love. And you think that you can love. And you think that you can love someone into love. You do your disappearing act. You do your disappearing act. Jealousy, it's not what it's cracked up to be. Envy, gets you where you need to be. Alone, rather the river than your stepping stones. Leave the graveyard before you turn to bones. I'm tragic, you're comedy. Oh, baby doll, the dogs are barking, they need to be fed. All the lepers you let in your head - is it empty now?. Cause you think that can love. And you think that you can love. And you think that you can love someone into love. You do your disappearing act. You do your disappearing act. Crédito: Violator LTD Co."

don't take your guns to town,"A young boy named Billy Joe, restless on the farm. A boy filled with wanderlust, who never really meant no harm. He changed his clothes and he shined his boots. And he combed his dark hair down. But his mama cried as he walked out:. 'Don't take your guns to town. Don't take your guns to town. Don't take your guns... to town'. He laughed and kissed his mom and said 'Your Billy Joe he's the man. I can shoot as quick, I can shoot as straight, as anybody, can. But I wouldn't shoot, without a cause, or gun nobody down'. But she cried again as he rode away:. 'Don't take your guns to town. Son, leave your guns at home. Don't take your guns to town'. Well he drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hands. And he tried, he tried to tell himself at last he had become a man. But a dusty cowpoke stood at his side, began to laugh him down. And he heard again his mother's words:. 'Don't take your guns to town. Son, leave your guns at home. Don't take your guns...'. Don't take your guns..... Don't take your guns to town. Don't take your guns..... Don't take your guns to town. Filled with rage then Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw. But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw. As Billy Joe fell to the floor the crowd all gathered around. And wondered at his final words:. 'Don't take your guns to town. Son, leave your guns at home. Don't take your guns to town'"

dying sailor to his shipmates,"Oh, wrap me in my country’s flag, and lay me in the cold blue sea. Let the roaring of the waves, my solemn requiem be. And I shall sleep a pleasant sleep, while storms above their vigils keep. My Captain brave shall read for me, the service of the silent dead. And yay shall lower me in the waves, when all the prayers are said. And I will find my long, long home, among the billows and the foam. Farewell my friends for many a league, we’ve sailed together on the deep. Come let us shake our hands, I’ll sail no more, but shipmates wear for weep. I’m bound above, my course is run. I near the port, my voyage is done."

As you need to be when you get older. George was a street, when you first faced the feat. You put money on the color of the sky. Well the color of her voice left you there no choice. But to drink the Liffey dry. The seeds that you sow. You wanna watch them growing. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Here comes Holy Joe, now how would he know. How laughter can make a man cruel. It's fire on fire, and lovers conspire. To either a duet or duel. When it's fire on fire, the flames just get higher. The harder you work to put them out. Well you know that you're similar, sugar and weedkiller. Both heading north facing south. The seeds that you sow. You wanna watch them growing. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Wild.... What's on your breath is the fear of death. That makes such a man promiscuous. Your mouth was dry like when you were about to lie. And her lips are so luscious. You've seen it before, you hurled at her door. Like a dog when she needed a man. Now she aches and she breaks, and she takes. On the weight of your world, 'cause she almost can. The seeds that you sow. Well you wanna watch them growing. The wind, where will it blow. My flower child. Growing wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Wild.... The sky was steel grey, up on Appian Way. As the yellow hats dug up the road. Didn't hear what you said, as the lights turned red. On a love that should have stayed gold. Gold. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart. Wild, you grow wild. You grow wild in my heart"

Well I don't even know the name. But if I did, well really, what's it to you. There's a blaze of light in every word. It doesn't matter which you heard. The holy or the broken, Hallelujah. Hallelujah.... I did my best, it wasn't much. I couldn't feel so I learned to touch. I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you. And even though it all went wrong. I'll stand before the Lord of song. With nothing on my lips, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Well, maybe there's a God above. But all I ever learned from love. Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you. And it's no complaint you hear tonight. It's not some pilgrim who's seen the light.

i believe in father christmas,They said there'll be snow at Christmas. They said there'll be peace on Earth. But instead it just kept on raining. A veil of tears for the Virgin's birth. I remember one Christmas morning. A winters light and a distant choir. And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell. And their eyes full of tinsel and fire. They sold me a dream of Christmas. They sold me a Silent Night. And they told me a fairy story. 'Till I believed in the Israelite. And I believed in Father Christmas. And I looked at the sky with excited eyes. 'Till I woke with a yawn in the first light of dawn. And I saw him and through his disguise. I wish you a hopeful Christmas. I wish you a brave New Year. All anguish pain and sadness. Leave your heart and let your road be clear. They said there'll be snow at Christmas. They said there'll be peace on Earth. Hallelujah Noel be it Heaven or Hell. The Christmas you get you deserve

I had the feeling it was out of control. I was of the opinion it was out of control.. I was of the feeling it was out of control. I had the opinion it was out of control.. I fought fate.

Side-step, sidewalk. I see you stare into space. Have I got closer now, behind the face?. Oh, tell me, Cherry you dance with me. Turn me around tonight. Up through the spiral staircase to the higher ground. Slide show, seaside town. Coca-cola, football radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio"

Sometimes you can't make it on your own"
song for someone,"You got a face not spoiled by beauty. I have some scars from where I've been. You've got eyes that can see right through me. You're not afraid of anything they've seen. I was told that I would feel nothing the first time. I don't know how these cuts heal. But in you I found a rhyme. If there is a light. You can't always see. And there is a world. We can't always be. If there is a dark. That we shouldn't doubt. And there is a light. Don't let it go out. And this is a song. A song for someone. This is a song. A song for someone. You let me into a conversation. A conversation only we could make. You're breaking into my imagination. Whatever's in there. It's yours to take. I was told I'd feel. Nothing the first time. You were slow to heal. But this could be the night. If there is a light. You can't always see. And there is a world. We can't always be. If there is a dark. Within and without. And there is a light. Don't let it go out. And this is a song. A song for someone. This is a song. This is a song for someone. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm a long way. From your hill on Cavalry. And I'm a long way. From where I was and where I need to be. If there is a light. You can't always see. There is a world. We can't always be. If there is a kiss. I stole from your mouth. And there is a light. Don't let it go out"

springhill mining disaster,"In the town of Springhill Nova Scotia. Down in the dark of the Cumberland mine. There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie. In roads that never saw sun or sky.

stand up comedy,"Love love love love love.... Love love love love love.... I got to stand up and take a step. You and I have been asleep for hours. I got to stand up. The wire is stretched in between our two towers. Stand up in this dizzy world. Where a lovesick eye can steal the view. I'm gonna fall down if I can't stand up. For your love. Love love love love love.... Stand up, this is comedy. The DNA lottery may have left you smart. But can you stand up to beauty, dictator of the heart. I can stand up for hope, faith, love. But while I'm getting over certainty. Stop helping God across the road like a little old lady. Out from under your beds. C'mon ye people. Stand up for your love. Love love love love love.... I gotta stand up to ego but my ego's not really the enemy. It's like a small child crossing an eight lane highway. On a voyage of discovery. Stand up to rock stars, Napolean is in high heels. Josephine, be careful of small men with big ideas. Out from under your beds. C'mon ye people. Stand up for your love. Love love love love love.... God is love. And love is evolution's very best day. Soul rockin' people moving on. Soul rockin' people on and on. C'mon ye people. We're made of stars. C'mon ye people. Stand up then sit down for your love. Love love love love love.... Love love love love love.... Crédito: Alex Sander Scofield (BrawBono)"

the ballad of ronnie drew,"Here's to the Ronnie, the voice we adore. Like coals from a coal bucket scraping the floor. Sing out his praises in music and malt. And if you're not Irish, that isn?t your fault. Raise up our voices like dogs in a pack. Thankful for honest men we never lack. We got 'em by twenties, we got ?em by ones. Them and their daughters and all of their sons. Here's to you, Ronnie Drew. Here's to you, Ronnie Drew. Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do. Here?s to you, Ronnie Drew, here?s to you. And what's it to any man whether or no?. Whether I?m easy or whether I?m true. As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow. And I tied up me sleeve for to buckle her shoe. Get up and go at it, five until five. When the whistle says budge it we come back alive. He'll sing to the heavens, he?s stormy as hell. And wherever he goes, we?ll be wishing him well. Here's to you, Ronnie Drew. Here's to you, Ronnie Drew. Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do. Here?s to you, Ronnie Drew, here?s to you. The dawn and the dust, the wise, the unjust. Kids in gambling games. The unheard, the unseen, the unwashed and unclean. Where the streets all have names. Baggers, street masons, street wagons to Stevens. With lovers and loners who can hear all intoners. The goths and the ravers, evil bids and traders. Sing out Ronnie Drew. A life for a life or a hand for a hand. Trust in the music and strike up the band. The more that we sing the less that we fight. Time and again this is proved to be right. Build you a statue on St. Stephen's Green. No fairer monument ere to be seen. The statue of Ronnie Drew holding the hand. Of a girl with her hair in a black velvet band. Here?s to you, Ronnie Drew. No stranger to devils or angles to tell. Here's to you, Ronnie Drew. A friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a. friend to you. Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do. Here?s to you, Ronnie Drew, here?s to you. Here?s to you, Ronnie Drew, here?s to you, Ronnie. Drew. Here?s to you, Ronnie Drew, here?s to you, Ronnie. Drew. And what?s it to any man whether or no?. Whether I?m easy or whether I?m true. As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow. And I rolled up me sleeve for to buckle her shoe. . By FoLgOsI"

the crystal ballroom,"Life begins with the first glance. The first kiss at the first dance. All of us are wondering why we're here. In the crystal ballroom underneath the chandelier. Wet the glass till the glasses sing. We punish our hearts till the heart bells ring. Cos where we come from we're not always kind. The human story is what love leaves behind. We're the ghosts of love and we haunt this place. We're the ghosts of love in every face. In the ballroom of the crystal lights. Everyone's here with me tonight. Everyone but you. Our first chance, is their last dance. Our life is shaped by another's hands. Buttoning unbuttoning her Coco dress. Stopping and unstopping every cold caress. Born for bliss, born for this. Every human life begins with a kiss. Kissed by every kind of possibility. And everyone is here tonight with me. We?re the ghosts of love and we haunt this place. We're the ghosts of love in every face. In the ballroom of the crystal lights. Everyone's here with me tonight. Everyone but you. Everyone but you"

I feel myself goin' down. I just call and he comes around.. But for the first time I feel love.. My father is a rich man, he wears a rich man's cloak.. He gave me the keys to his kingdom (coming). Gave me a cup of gold.. He said ""I have many mansions. And there are many rooms to see."". But I left by the back door. And I threw away the key. And I threw away the key.. For the first time, for the first time. For the first time, I feel love."

From digging in our pockets, for a reason not to say goodbye.. These are the hands, that built America.. Ahhhh America.. Last saw your face, in a water colour sky..

the little things that give you away,"The night gave you a song. A light had been turned on. You walked out in the world. Like you belong there. As easy as a breeze. Each heart was yours to please.

Your big mouth in the way. It's the little things that tease and betray. As the hunted I become the prey. It's the little things. The little things that give you away. I saw you on the stairs. You didn't notice I was there. That's ‘cause you were talking at me. And not to me. You were high above the storm. A hurricane being born. What is freedom. It might cost you your liberty. It's the little things that give you away. The words you cannot say. Your big mouth in the way. It's the little things that tease and betray. As the hunted I become the prey. It's the little things. The little things that give you away. Sometimes. I can't believe my existence. See myself on a distance. I can't get back inside. Sometimes. The air is so anxious. All my thoughts are so reckless. And all of my innocence has died. Sometimes. I wake at four in the morning. Where all the darkness is swarming. And it covers me in fear. Sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes. I'm full of anger and grieving. So far away from believing. That any song will reappear. Sometimes. The end is not coming. It's not coming. The end is here. Sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes. When the paintings are shadows. And you're the only that matters. And I can see you through the tears. Sometimes. The end is not coming. It's not coming. The end is here. Sometimes"

the miracle (of joey ramone),"I was chasing down the days of fear. Chasing down a dream before it disappeared. I was aching to be somewhere new. Your voice was all I heard. I was shaking from a storm in me. Haunted by the spectors that we had to see. Yeah, I wanted to be the melody. Above the noise, above the herd. I was young. Not dumb. Just wishing to be blinded. By you. Brand new. And we were pilgrims on our way. I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred. Heard a song that made some sense out of the world. Everything I ever lost now has been returned. In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. We've got language so we can communicate. Religion so I can love and hate. Music so I can exaggerate my pain, and give it a name. I was young. Not dumb. Just wishing to be blinded. By you. Brand new. And we were pilgrims on our way. I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred. Heard a song that made some sense out of the world. Everything I ever lost now has been returned. In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. We can hear you. We can hear you. We can hear you. I woke up at the moment when the miracle ocurred. I get so many things I don't deserve. All the stolen voices will someday be returned. The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. Your voices will be heard. Your voices will be heard"

The gates of that mansion?. If O.J. is more than a drink. And a Big Mac bigger than you think. And perfume is an obsession. And talk shows… confession. What have we got to lose?. Another push and we'll be through. The gates of that mansion.. I never bought a lotto ticket. I never parked in anyone's space.. The banks they're like cathedrals. I guess casinos took their place.. Love, come on down. Don't wake her she'll come around.. Chance is a kind of religion. Where you're damned for plain hard luck.. I never did see that movie. I never did read that book.. Love, come on down. Let my numbers come around.. Don't know if I can hold on. Don't know if I'm that strong.. Don't know if I can wait that long. Till the colours come flashing. And the lights go on.. Then will there be no time for sorrow. Then will there be no time for shame. Though I can't say why. I know I've got to believe.. We'll go driving in that pool. It's who you know that gets you through. The gates of the playboy mansion.. Then will there be no time for sorrow. Then will there be no time for shame. Then will there be now time for shame. Then will there be now time for pain. ."

the unforgettable fire,"Ice, your only rivers run cold.. These city lights, they shine as silver and gold.. Dug from the night, your eyes as black as coal.. Walk on by, walk on through.. Walk till you run and don't look back. For here I am.. Carnival, the wheels fly and the colours spin through alcohol.. Red wine that punctures the skin.. Face to face in a dry and waterless place.. Walk on by, walk on through.. So sad to besiege your love… oh hang on.. Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie.. I'm only asking, but I, I think you know.. Come on take me away, come on take me away. Come on take me home, home again.. And if the mountains should crumble. Or disappear into the sea. Not a tear, no not I.. Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie.. Ever after is a long time..

the wanderer,". I went out walking through streets paved with gold. Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones. Of a city without a soul. I went out walking under an atomic sky. Where the ground won't turn and the rain it burns. Like the tears when I said goodbye.. Yeah, I went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.. I went wandering.. I went drifting through the capitals of tin. Where men can't walk or freely talk. And sons turn their fathers in.. I stopped outside a church house. Where the citizens like to sit.. They say they want the kingdom. But they don't want God in it.. I went out riding down that old eight-lane. I passed a thousand signs looking for my own name.. I went with nothing but the thought you'd be there too,. Looking for you.. I went out there in search of experience. To taste and to touch and to feel as much. As a man can before he repents.. I went out searching, looking for one good man. A spirit who would not bend or break. Who would sit at his father's right hand.. I went out walking with a bible and a gun. The word of God lay heavy on my heart. I was sure I was the one.. Now Jesus, don't you wait up, Jesus I'll be home soon.. Yeah, I went out for the papers, told her I'd be back by noon.. Yeah, I left with nothing but the thought you'd be there too. Looking for you.. Yeah, I went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.. I went wandering.. ."

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.. Walked together down a dead-end street. We were mixing the bitter with the sweet.. Don't try to figure out what we might have had.. Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad.. I'm just a singer, some say a sinner. Rolling the dice, not always a winner.. You say I've been lucky, well hell, I made my own. Not part of the crowd not feeling alone.. Under pressure but not bent out of shape. Surrounded, we always found an escape.. Drove me to drink but hey, that's not all bad.. Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.. Guess I've been greedy all of my life. Greedy with my children, my lovers and my wife.. Greedy for the good things as well as the bad.. Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.. Maybe it's just talk, saloon singing. The chairs are all stacked, the swingers stopped. swinging.. You say I hurt you, you put the finger on yourself. Then, after you did it, you came crying for my help.. Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.. I'm not complaining baby, I'm glad.. You call it compromise, well what's that?. Two shots of happy, one shot of sad.. Two shots of happy, one shot of sad."

Hear me, cease to speak that I may speak. Shush now. Oh, oh. Force quit and move to trash. I was right there at the top of the bottom. On the edge of the known universe where I wanted to be. I had driven to the scene of the accident. And I sat there waiting for me. Restart and re-boot yourself. You're free to go. Oh, oh. Shout for joy if you get the chance. Password, you enter here, right now. Oh, oh. You know your name, so punch it in. Hear me, cease to speak, that I may speak. Shush now. Oh, oh. Don't move or say a thing"
until the end of the world,"Haven't seen you in quite a while. I was down the hold just passing time. Last time we met was a low-lit room. We were as close together as a bride and groom. We ate the food, we drank the wine. Everybody having a good time. Except you. You were talking about the end of the world. I took the money. I spiked your drink. You miss too much these days if you stop to think. You lead me on with those innocent eyes. You know I love the element of surprise. In the garden I was playing the tart. I kissed your lips and broke your heart. You...you were acting like it was. The end of the world. (Love...love...). In my dream I was drowning my sorrows. But my sorrows, they learned to swim. Surrounding me, going down on me. Spilling over the brim. Waves of regret and waves of joy. I reached out for the one I tried to destroy. You...you said you'd wait. 'til the end of the world"
van diemen's land,"Hold me now, oh hold me now. Till this hour has gone around. And I gone, on the rising tide. For to face Van Diemen's land.. It's a bitter pill I swallow here. To be rent from one so dear.. We fought for justice and not for gain. But the magistrate sent me away.. Hold me now, oh hold me now. Till this hour has gone around. And I gone, on the rising tide. For to face Van Diemen's land.. Now kings will rule and the poor will toil. And tear their hands as they tear the soil. But a day will come in this dawning age. When an honest man sees an honest wage.. Hold me now, oh hold me now. Till this hour has gone around. And I'm gone on the rising tide. For to face Van Diemen's Land."

I'm asking for the cheque. The girl with crimson nails. Has Jesus round her neck. Swinging to the music. Swinging to the music. Oh oh oh oh. Hello hello (Hola!). I'm at a place called Vertigo (Donde estás?). It's everything I wish I didn't know. But you give me something I can feel, feel. Check mated. Hours of fun. Show meaning!. All of this, all this can be yours. All of this, all this can be yours. All of this, all this can be yours. Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt..... Hello hello, (hola!). We're at a place called Vertigo(Donde estás?). Lights go down and all I know. Is that you give me something. I can feel your love teaching me how. Your love is teaching me how, how to kneel....

Listen over the rhythm that's confusing you. Listen to the reed in the saxophone. Listen over the hum of the radio. Listen over the sound of blades in rotation. Listen through the traffic and circulation. Listen as hope and peace try to rhyme. Listen over marching bands playing out their time.. Wake up, wake up dead man. Wake up, wake up dead man.. Jesus, were you just around the corner?. Did you think to try and warn her?. Were you working on something new?. If there's an order in all of this disorder. Is it like a tape recorder?. Can we rewind it just once more?. Wake up, wake up dead man. Wake up, wake up dead man.. Wake up, wake up dead man.. ."

What you got they can't steal it. No they can't even feel it. Walk on, walk on.... Stay safe tonight. You're packing a suitcase. for a place none of us has been.

Can't sell it, or buy it. Walk on, walk on. Stay safe tonight. And I know it aches. And your heart it breaks. And you can only take so much. Walk on, walk on. Home... hard to know what it is if you've never had one. Home... I can't say where it is. but I know I'm going home. That's where the hurt is. And I know it aches. And your heart it breaks. And you can only take so much. Walk on, walk on. Leave it behind. You've got to leave it behind. All that you fashion. All that you make. All that you build. All that you break. All that you measure. All that you feel. All this you can leave behind. All that you reason, it's only time. And I'll never fill up all I find. All that you sense. All that you scheme. All you dress-up. All that you've seen. All you create. All that you wreck. All that you hate..."
walk to the water,"She said it wasn't cold. She left her coat at home that day. She wore canvas shoes, white canvas shoes. Around her neck she wore a silver necklace. ""It was given to me by my father."" she said. ""That was given to me."". She took the back way home. Passed the lights at Summer Hill. Turned left on to the North Strand and on. On towards the sea.. He said he was an artist. But he really painted billboards. In large capital letters. In large capital letters. He was telling jokes. Nobody else would listen to him. I saw you that day, your lips of cherry red. Your legs were crossed, your arms wide open. Your hair was coloured gold. And like a field of corn. You were blown by the wind. You were blown by the wind. Walk, walk, walk. To the water. Walk with me a while. Walk, walk, walk. To the roadside. Walk with me. In the light. A room in the Royal Hotel. With sea-facing views. A man with a suitcase. Full of things he doesn't need. I'm looking through your window. I'm walking through your doorway. I'm on the outside let me in. Let me love you. Let me love you. Let me. Walk, walk, walk. To the water. Walk with me. Walk, walk, walk. To the roadside. Walk with me a while"
wave of sorrow,"Heat haze rising. On hell's own hill. You wake up this morning. It took an act of will. You walk through the night. To get here today. To bring your children. To give them away. Oh... oh this cruel sun. Is daylight never done. Cruelty just begun. To make a shadow of everyone. And if the rain came. And if the rain came. Souls bent over without a breeze. Blankets on burning trees. I am sick without disease. Nobility on it's knees. And if the rain came. And if the rain came... now. Would it wash us all away. On a wave of sorrow. Wave. On a wave of sorrow. Where now the holy cities?. Where the ancient holy scrolls?. Where now Emperor Menelek?. And the Queen of Sheba's gold. You're my bride, you wear her crown. And on your finger precious stones. As every good thing now been sold. Son, of shepherd boy, now king. What wisdom can you bring?. What lyric would you sing?. Where is the music of the Seraphim?. And if the rain came. And if the rain came... now. Would it wash us all away. On a wave of sorrow. Wave. A wave of sorrow. Wave.. Blessed are the meek who scratch in the dirt. For they shall inherit what's left of the earth. Blessed are the kings who've left their thrones. They are buried in this valley of dry bones. Blessed all of you with an empty heart. For you got nothing from which you cannot part. Blessed is the ego. It's all we got this hour. Blessed is the voice that speaks truth to power. Blessed is the sex worker who sold her body tonight. She used what she got. To save her children's life. Blessed are you, the deaf cannot hear a scream. Blessed are the stupid who can dream. Blessed are the tin canned cardboard slums. Blessed is the spirit that overcomes. Cesar"

when i look at the world,"When you look at the world. What is it that you see?. People find all kinds of things. That bring them to their knees. I see an expression. So clear and so true. That it changes the atmosphere. When you walk into the room. So I try to be like you. Try to feel it like you do. But without you it's no use. I can't see what you see. When I look at the world. When the night is someone else's. And you're trying to get some sleep. When your thoughts are too expensive. To ever want to keep. When there's all kinds of chaos. And everyone is walking lame. You don't even blink now, do you. Or even look away. So I try to be like you. Try to feel it like you do. But without you it's no use. I can't see what you see. When I look at the world. I can't wait any longer. I can't wait till I'm stronger. Can't wait any longer. To see what you see. When I look at the world. I'm in the waiting room. Can't see for the smoke. I think of you and your holy book. While the rest of us choke. Tell me, tell me, what do you see?. Tell me, tell me, what's wrong with me"
when love comes to town,"I was a sailor, I was lost at sea. I was under the waves before love rescued me.. I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread. Now I stand accused of the things I've said.. When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train. When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.. Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down. But I did what I did before love came to town.. Used to make love under a red sunset. I was making promises I was soon to forget.. She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown. But I left her standing before love came to town.. I ran into a juke-joint when I heard a guitar scream. The notes were turning blue, I was dazed and in a dream.. As the music played I saw my life turn around. That was the day before love came to town.. When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train. When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.. Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down. But I did what I did before love came to town.. When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train. When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.. Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down. But I did what I did before love came to town.. I was there when they crucified my Lord. I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword.. I threw the dice when they pierced his side. But I've seen love conquer the great divide.. When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train. When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.. Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down. But I did what I did before love came to town."

Did you crack it, did you taunt it. Was it really what you wanted. Did you burn in the sun. Or are you burning for someone?. Did you shoot it, did you stab it. Did you chase it like a rabbit. Did you walk, did you run. Did you come in at number one?. I know what you do. Put your soul in the song. But now it's sinking like you. Where did it all go wrong. Did you drown it, did you clown it. Would you really have gone down on it. Did you clean it, clean it up. Did you rub it, did you soap. Did you screen it, did you ream it. Did you ruin it, did you feed it. Is it warm in the sun.

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust.. We're beaten and blown by the wind. Trampled in dust.. I'll show you a place. High on a desert plain. Where the streets have no name. Where the streets have no name. Where the streets have no name.. We're still building and burning down love. Burning down love.. And when I go there. I go there with you. (It's all I can do).. Our love turns to rust.. We're beaten and blown by the wind,. blown by the wind. Our love turns to rust, see our love turns to rust. We're beaten and blown by the wind,. blown by the wind.

white as snow,"Where I came from there were no hills at all. The land was flat, the highway straight and wide. My brother and I, would drive for hours, like we had. years instead of days. Our faces as pale as the dirty snow. Once I knew there was a love divine. Then came a time I thought it knew me not. Who can forgive forgiveness when forgiveness is not?. Only the lamb as white as snow. And the water it was icy. As it washed over me. And the moon shone above me. Now this dry ground it bears no fruit at all. Only poppies laugh under the crescent moon. The road refuses strangers. The land, the seeds we sow. Where might we find a lamb as white as snow?. As boys we would go hunting in the wood. To sleep, the night shooting out the stars. Now the wolves are every passing stranger. Every face we cannot know. If only a heart could be as white as snow. If only a heart could be as white as snow. Por:Alex Sander Scofield (BrawBono)"

You're an accident waiting to happen. You're a piece of glass left there on a beach.. Well you tell me things. I know you're not supposed to. Then you leave me just out of reach.. Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?. Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?. Well you stole it 'cos I needed the cash. And you killed it 'cos I wanted revenge.. Well you lied to me 'cos I asked you to.. Baby, can we still be friends?. Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?. Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?. Ah, the deeper I spin. Ah, the hunter will sin for your ivory skin.. Took a drive in the dirty rain. To a place where the wind calls your name. Under the trees, the river laughing at you and me.. Hallelujah! Heaven's white rose. The doors you open I just can't close..

Come on now love, don't you look back.. Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?. Who's gonna taste your saltwater kisses?. Who's gonna take the place of me?. Who's gonna ride your wild horses?. Who's gonna tame the heart of thee?"

wild irish rose,"In a field by a river. my love and I did lie. And on my naked shoulder. she too proud to cry. She said that I must leave her. an icy tear she froze. How could I melt the heart. Of a Wild Irish Rose. . Well a gypsy she has made of me. A servent of the street. And back to bed I've travelled. To taste a love as sweet. Well the heart it knows no reasons. And reason never knows. As I lie with them I'm thinking. Of a Wild Irish Rose. . Well I saw the city of angels. It brought a devil out in me. And Hell's hotel on Sunset. Showed a whore no mercy. As the orange sky was screaming. From the roof I let her go. These are the dizzying heights that brought me. My Wild Irish Rose. . Now red is the rose. That she layed on my grave. A life is what she wanted. And a life I surely gave. Like a hundred men before me. They lay lying here in rows. Young men, bloody."

Love makes strange enemies. Makes love where love may please. The soul and its striptease. Hate brought to its knees. The sky over our head. We can reach it from our bed. You let me in your heart.

winter,"The yellow sun,. Well it took the hand,. Of a country boy,. To a city in a far off land.. We made no mark,. No shadow at all,. On the ancient holy streets,. Where I learned to crawl.. The broken and the bruised. The young and the used,. The sure and confused all here. Words will land on me,. Then abandon me,. Mangle, untangle me,. Leave me on the floor. Rhymes they sprang in me,. Summer sang in me,. But summer sings in me no more.. Now I'm 25,. I'm trying to stay alive,. In a corner of the world,. With no clear enemies to fight.. It's hot as hell,. We're like butter on toast. But there's no army in this world,. That can fight a ghost.. The broken and the bruised. The young and the used,. The sure and confused all here. Words would land on me,. Then abandon me,. Leave me stranded,. And lining on the door. Rhymes began in me,. Summer sang in me,. But summer sings in me no more.. Ooooo-oooo-ooooooo--oooooooooOOOOOOOooooooooo. (Listening to the cries. The strangers. The silence of the foreign grave. Listening to the thunder. The sky is strange. Stretched over everyone. Listening to the tales. The child sings. That goes for days and days. Listening to the calls. Shouts, frustration. At twenty-one. I was born a son. And on that day I knew. I could kill. To protect the ones. We put bullets in guns. Or anything it takes. To take a life until it's still. . (Por:Alex Sander Scofield-BrawBono)"
