common life,Say you'll never do. Say you'll never get into. All the things you hate. All the things you swore not to be. Say no more. You will soon be gone. All the things you have. All the dreams you left behind. All that you became. Are you ready for this life?. Say no more. You will soon be gone
complicity,Nobody can have this. There is no home. Nobody can watch this. She stays on her own. Its all right that you will stay. Your indiscipline is welcome. This may be your gift. A child running down the stairs. With scissors in her hands. This is how she feels now. Nobody can take that away. Its all right that you will stay. Your indiscipline is welcome. This may be your gift. Please show us complicity. Please take us to your Paradise. Nobody can get enough. Nobody can show you how
fire,"Coming back again. Coming back from fire... fire. They have to prove. They didn't come back from fire. And this, is pulling me down. They showed me how. Take me to your fire. They might even see. Take me to your fire. They might not see. Coming back again. Coming back from fire, fire. They have to prove. They can't even say... say. And this, is shooting me down. They showed me how. Take me to your fire. They might even see. Take me to your fire. They might not see"
grow,"They will watch. They will know. You can hold on. Or fade away. But they will come back. Like a fever. Ask more. For your fear. You must know. They control. But not your soul. They have you, not your mind. Cinicism is the key. And your gun. The truth is dead. Like your hope. Cry your soul"
life is a no,Life is a no. Hope is a bleeding gift. And this thing you love. Will never show the truth for the good. Say you never. Will come back here with us. They will know. That you take yourself to the ground. The mind is a no. Thinking is a bleeding gift. And this thing you trust. Will never show the answer for you. Say you never. Will come back here with us. They will know. That you take yourself to the ground
new song,"Through the city, against the lights. How many lives are really strange?. I guess she's doing fine. She thinks I will be fine. She's feeling high. She's feeling shiny. If I can't be myself I'm better off dead. Give me some drink tonight. She's feeling high. She's feeling high. She's feeling shiny. She's feeling shiny. All lights point the way you've chosen"
one string song,"Come on, this place can't be like this. Come on, let me flow. Come on, this place can't be like that. You know, let me see all. Wherever you go, go without my love. Wherever you go, go without my love"
over now,Finally it's over now. Who do you think you are?. Finally it's over... I can't. So tell me what you think you did. Tell me what you think I know. Please don't tell me. So tell me what you think you did. Tell me what you think I know. Please don't tell me
save me,Come on and save me. Messing around. You know I let myself down. Allow me to know. Let me save the morning. Let me live that
you never know,"You never know, sad and grey like my doubt. You never know, sad and grey like my doubt. You never know. You never know. I can't hear the sound, the wind doesn't blow. The world has just died. Once again, for your fun. Break me. You never know, no light shines in my eyes. You never know, no light shines in my eyes. Can't hear the sound, the wind doesn't blow. The world has just died. This time, for your fun. Break me again"
