in the morning of the magicians,In the morning I'd awake and couldn't remember. What is love and what is hate? - the calculations error. Oh-oh-oh-what is love and what is hate?. And why does it matter? - is to love just a waste. How would it matter?. As the dawn began to break - I had to surrender. The universe will have its way - too powerful to master. Oh-oh-oh-what is love and what is hate?. And why does it matter? - is to love just to hate??. And how does it matter?.

And you're gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Picture yourself on a train in a station. With plasticine porters with looking glass ties. Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile. The girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Lucy in the sky with diamonds"

"she's leaving home (feat. phantogram, julianna barwick & spaceface)","Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins. Silently closing her bedroom door. Leaving the note that she hoped would say more. She goes downstairs to the kitchen. clutching her hankerchief. Quietly turning the backdoor key. Stepping outside she is free. She (We gave her most of our lives). is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives). home (We gave her everything money could buy). She's leaving home after living alone. For so many years. Bye, bye. Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown. Picks up the letter that's lying there. Standing alone at the top of the stairs. She breaks down and cries to her husband. Daddy our baby's gone. Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly. How could she do this to me. She (We never thought of ourselves). Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves). home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by). She's leaving home after living alone. For so many years. Bye, bye. Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away. Waiting to keep the appointment she made. Meeting a man from the motor trade. She (What did we do that was wrong). Is having (We didn't know it was wrong). Fun. (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy). Something inside that was always denied. For so many years. She is leaving home. Bye, Bye"

smoke on the water,"We all came out to Montreaux. On the Lake Geneva shoreline. To make records with a mobile. We didn't have much time. Frank Zappa and the Mothers. Were at the best place around. But some stupid with a flare gun. Burned the place to the ground. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water. They burned down the gambling house. It died with an awful sound. Funky Claude was running in and out. Pulling kids out the ground. When it all was over. We had to find another place. But Swiss time was running out. It seemed that we would lose the race. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water. We ended up at the Grand Hotel. It was empty, cold and bare. But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside. Making our music there. With a few red lights and a few old beds. We made a place to sweat. No matter what we get out of this. I know, I know we'll never forget. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water"

thanks to you,I want to thank you. You've been the meaning of life for me. Now I can see the real me. Feelings I couldn't bear. All the things I wouldn't dare. Times I thought no one cared. Then I looked at you. You were there. Sometimes I think this has all been a dream. But I wake up to find that it's not what it seems in my mind. It's all mine. Feelings I couldn't bear. All the things I wouldn't dare. Times I thought no one cared. Then I looked at you. You were there. People don't know what the songs are about. They just sing them out like they mean. Something we never thought about.

And the castle can never be rebuilt again. No way. [Verse 2]. One day a strange storm rolled in. While she was riding on her dragon. The mushrooms and the bumblebees. Told the flowers how it happened. She was lost in the invisible war. Fighting in the battle. Her love is still buried there. In the ruins of the castle. [Chorus 2]. And the castle oscillates to the beating heart of her mind. And the castle is taller than the Northern Lights. And the castle can never rebuilt again. No way. [Post-Chorus]. And the castle can never rebuilt again. No way. And the castle can never rebuilt again. No way. [Outro]. No way. No way. (No way). No way, no way. No way"

That we thought that we had. Still the battle that weâ€™re in. Rages on till the end. With explosions, wounds are open. Sights and smells, eyes and noses. But the thought that went unspoken. Was understanding that youâ€™re broken. Still the last volunteer battles on. Battles on."

the spark that bled,"I accidentally touched my head. And noticed that I had been bleeding. For how long I didnâ€™t know. What was this, I thought, that struck me?. What kind of weapons have they got?. The softest bullet ever shot. I stood up and I said, yeah!. I stood up and I said, yeah!. I stood up and I said, hey! Yeah!. From this moment on. Blaring like a trumpet. Coming from above us and somewhere below. The confidence of knowing. Descending to relieve us of the struggle. To believe itâ€™s so. I stood up and I said, yeah!. I stood up and I said, yeah!. I stood up and I said, hey! Yeah!. And it seemed to cause a chain reaction. It had momentum, it was gaining traction. It was all the rage, it was all the fashion. The outreached hands had resigned themselves. To holding onto something that they never had. And thatâ€™s too bad. 'Cause in reality there was no reaction. I accidentally touched my head. And noticed that I had been bleeding."

the spiderbite song,"When you got that spider bite on your hand. I thought we would have to break up the band. To lose your arm would surely upset your brain. The poison then could reach your heart from a vein. I was glad that it didnâ€™t destroy you. How sad that would be. Cause if it destroyed you. It would destroy me. When you had that accident in your car. That whole thing just really seemed too bizarre. Dodging holes and telephone poles through the dash. A million to one that you would survive such a crash. I was glad that it didnâ€™t destroy you. How sad that would be. Cause if it destroyed you. It would destroy me. When you fell in love, it was so sweet. So devoted, completely swept off your feet. Love is the greatest thing a heart can know. But the hole that it leaves in its absence can make you feel so low. And I was glad that it didnâ€™t destroy you. How sad that would be. Cause if it destroyed you. It would destroy me."

The bright blessed days, and dark sacred nights. And I think to myself, what a wonderful world. The colors of the rainbow. Are so pretty in the sky. It's also on the faces. Of people goin' by. I see friends shakin' hands. Sayin', ""How do you do?"". Fairies sayin', ""I love you."". I hear babies cry, and I watch 'em grow. They'll learn much more than I'll ever know. And I think to myself, what a wonderful world."

I could stay with you. I could be handy, mending a fuse. When your lights have gone. You can knit a sweater by the fireside. Sunday mornings go for a ride. Doing the garden, digging the weeds. Who could ask for more?. Will you still need me, will you still feed me. When I'm sixty-four. Every summer we can rent a cottage. In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear. We shall scrimp and save. Grandchildren on your knee. Vera, Chuck and Dave. Send me a postcard, drop me a line. Stating point of view. Indicate precisely what you mean to say. Your's sincerely wasting away. Give me your answer, fill in a form. Mine for evermore. Will you still need me, will you still feed me. When I'm sixty-four?"

The whole thing leaves. You a nothing instead of a these. The bone is cracked and the cracked eggshells fly. And your number is backwards again when you drive. The whole thing's removed when you're 22. When you're 22. .

within you whitout you (feat. birdflower & morgan delt),"""we were talking. About the space between us all. And the people. Who hide themselves behind a wall. Of illusion. Never glimpse the truth.

With our love we could save the world. If they only knew. Try to realise it's all within yourself. No one else can make you change. And to see you're really only very small. And life flows on within you. And without you. We were talking. About the love that's gone so cold. And the people. Who gain the world and lose their soul. They dont know. They can't see. Are you one of them?. When you've seen beyond yourself. Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there. And the time will come when you see. We're all one. and life flows on within you and without you. """
