loser,"In the time of chimpanzees. I was a monkey. Butane in my veins. So I'm out to cut the junkie. With the plastic eyeballs,. Spray-paint the vegetables. Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose. Kill the headlights. And put it in neutral. Stock car flamin' with a loser. And the cruise control. Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D. Got a couple of couches,. Sleep on the love-seat. Someone keeps sayin'. I'm insane to complain. About a shotgun wedding. And a stain on my shirt. Don't believe everything that you breathe. You get a parking violation. And a maggot on your sleeve. So shave your face. With some mace in the dark. Savin' all your food stamps. And burnin' down the trailer park. (Yo. Cut it.). Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. (Double-barrel buckshot). Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare. Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber. 'Cuz one's got a weasel. And the other's got a flag. One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag. With the rerun shows. And the cocaine nose-job. The daytime crap of the folksinger slop. He hung himself with a guitar string. Slap the turkey-neck. And it's hangin' from a pigeon wing. You can't write if you can't relate. Trade the cash for the beef. For the body for the hate. And my time is a piece of wax. Fallin' on a termite. Who's chokin' on the splinters. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. (Get crazy with the cheeze whiz). Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. (Drive-by body-pierce). (Yo, bring it on down). Soooooooyy..... [chorus backwards]. (I'm a driver, I'm the winner;. Things are gonna change. I can feel it). Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. (I can't believe you). Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. [repeat]. (Sprechen sie Deutches, baby?). Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. (Know what I'm sayin'?)"
ozzy,"Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy. Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy. Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy...(can I get a little echo on this?). Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy. What does it mean?. The fire is green. The demons just came through the window. Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy. Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy. Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy. Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy. Big-league man. The future looks dim. Using [???] forever. Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy. Ozzy! You're the man!. How can I grasp you power?. I'm sittin' here lookin' at this keychain. And you...uh, there's mascara bleeding out of your eyes. The microphone is in flames. And there's a giant chicken claw above your head. Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy."

Found our way through the lost years. Now the day brings it all here. 'all the colors, see the colors. Feel the colors, ' she says. See it in your eyes. 'all the colors, see the colors. Feel the colors. Tell me, do you feel alive? '. I've got all the love you need. I've got all the love you need. Keep it with you. I don't have the time to wait. I don't have the time to way.

tarantula,"I'm living but I'm feeling numb. Can see it in my stare. I wear my mask so falsely numb. And I don't know who I am. Despite the worlds inside of me. Pushing me away. I've noticed in others' eyes. The time's closing in. And when the thunder breaks. It breaks for you and me. Tarantula. Tarantula. Tarantula. Tarantula. If you're just looking [?]. The strange black tide. Decisions lie with foolish man. Alone with my life. And they're chockin' and holdin' me. Expecting me to fall. But only if I threaten. We'll see the tables turn. And when the thunder breaks. It breaks for you and me. Tarantula. Tarantula. Tarantula. Tarantula. Our world is under a sentence of death. I was born underground. But when the pressure gets too much for me. Bye, bye. Tarantula. Tarantula. Tarantula. Tarantula (Tarantula). Tarantula. Tarantula (Tarantula). Tarantula (Tarantula). Tarantula (Tarantula)"
wow,"[Intro]. Giddy up, giddy it up. Giddy up, giddy up. [Verse 1]. Wanna move into a fool's gold room. With my pulse on the animal jewels. Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose. With the luminous moves. Bored of these limits, let me get, let me get it like. [Chorus]. Wow!. It's like right now. It's like wow!. It's like right, right now. It's like wow!. It's like right now. It's like wow!. It's like right now. Oh wow. [Verse 2]. It's my life, your life. Live it once, can't live it twice. So nice, so nice. Song's like a tidal wave, take you on a getaway. My friends, your friends. Love 'em every day like it's just about to end. Now we're pissin' in the wind cause it's so pine fresh. Like now. Yeah I, I wanna get it like. [Chorus]. Wow!. It's like right now. It's like wow!. It's like. Giddy up!. Wow!. It's like right now. Wow!. Oh wow, it's like right now. [Verse 3]. It's your life. Falling like a hot knife. Call your wife; secular times, these times. My demon's on the cell phone. To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong. It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes boom. Standing on a line doin' jiu jitsu. Girl in the bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu. [Bridge]. It's your life. You gotta try to get it right. Look around, don't forget where you came from. It's just another perfect night. We're gonna take it around the world. We're gonna take it around the world. When this one is over. I lose my emotions. We're gonna take it around the world. [Outro]. Like. Wow, wow, wow. Like. Giddy up!. Giddy up!. Wow!"
square one,"I've been watching the wheels turning. But I'm learning to enjoy the ride. On the road to nowhere. I hope we get there soon. 'cause it's a place we've been before. Knocking on purgatory's door. To find a place in the sun. A chameleon changing colors on demand. 'cause this is life and it's alright. Taking detours in your mind. You'll be fine if you try. To keep your eyes on the consolation prize. When you lower your expectations. And you've run out of patience. It's all a part of the plan. When you're lost in the world. And you're going down hard for the girl. I've been running the lights in the city. Saying 'who can I be running from? '. My demons told my skeletons. 'he won't get very far'. And when I got to the dark side of the moon. All the trouble I thought I knew. It left me out in the cold. Spinning out of control on a broken carousel. Now tell me this is life and it's alright. Chasing windmills in your mind. You'll be fine if you try. To keep your eyes on the consolation prize. On the road to tomorrow. Gonna have to beg, steal, or borrow. It's all a part of the plan. When you're dead to the world. And you're going down hard for the girl. For the girl. For the girl. For the girl. For the girl. See you on the other side of love all alone. Sooner or later at the end of the world. See you on the other side of love all alone. Sooner or later at the end of the world. 'cause this is life and it's alright. Taking detours in your mind. You'll be fine if you try. To keep your eyes on the consolation prize. On the road to valhalla. Karma riding shotgun with drama. It's all a part of the plan. When you're lost in the world. And you're going down hard for the girl"

up all night,"When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold. When they break it down and this world is all you know. Hands up, you're waving it 'round. Now get yourself together. When you count the dominos fall, it's time to go. Now I'm feeling so far away. I see the colors and all the kids going home. Night is crawling into the day. I hear my voice ringing. The summertime's singing. Just wanna stay up all night with you. Just wanna stay up all night with you. There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do. Just wanna stay up all night with you. I'll keep it moving. Don't wait for nothing now. Gotta keep it moving. Don't wait for nothing now. I'll keep it moving. Don't wait, don't wait for nothing now. Gotta keep it moving. Don't wait for nothing now, nothing now. 1, 2, what you doing?. I've been jumping through some hoops. Wanna get my body loose. Wanna tell you, tell you what to do. I've been running out of breath like an animal struggling. Looking for a diamond. I'm trying, I'm fighting. Back into the rhythm now. I just wanna stay up all night. Wanna stay up all night with you. With you, you. Just wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night). Just wanna stay up all night with you. There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night). Just wanna stay up all night with you. Hands up in the air. If you don't really care. Living don't get you there. If you got the climb to take it up there. Hands up in the air. Living out on a prayer. Living don't get you there. Nothing that I want but rather be there"

devil's haircut,"Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading. And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting. Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis. Stealing kisses from the leperous faces. Heads are hanging from the garbage man trees. Mouthwash jukebox gasoline. Pistols are pointing at a poor man's pockets. Smiling eyes ripping out of his sockets. Got a devil's haircut in my mind. Got a devil's haircut in my mind. Got a devil's haircut in my mind. Got a devil's haircut in my mind. Love machines on the sympathy crutches. Discount orgies on the dropout buses. Hitching a ride with the bleeding noses. Coming to town with the brief case blues. Got a devil's haircut in my mind. Got a devil's haircut in my mind. Got a devil's haircut in my mind. Got a devil's haircut in my mind. Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading. Ghetto-blastin' disintegrating. Rock 'n' roll, know what I'm sayin'. And everywhere I look there's a devil waiting.

Blow back derelict wind,. lay my soul in the fallow field. Blow back derelict wind,. lay my soul in the fallow field. Shooting venom at the passers-by. Hijackers tie the heavens down. I put my eyes in a paper bag. I'm spinning round like a gambling wheel. Blow back derelict wind,. lay my soul in the fallow field. Blow back derelict wind,. lay my soul in the fallow field. I dropped my anchor in the dead of night. I packed my suitcase and threw it away. I fell asleep in the funeral fire. I gave my clothes to the police man.

hotwax,"It takes a backwash man to sing a backwashed song. Like a frying pan when the fire's gone. Driving my pig while the bear's taking pictures. in the grass And my radio's smashed. And I like pianos in the evening sun. Dragging my heals 'til my day is done. Saturday night in the Captain's clothes. Tin horns blowing with my jewelry fros. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. I can't believe my way back when. My Cadillac pants going much to fast. Karaoke weekend at the suicide shack. Community service and I'm still the mack. Shocked my finger spicing my hand. I been spreading disease all across the land. Beautiful air-conditioned sitting in the kitchen. Wishing I was living like a hit man. Face down in the guarantees. Jaundiced marshalls getting busy with ease. Because I get down I get down I get down all the way. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. Sawdust songs of the plaid bartenders. Western Unions of the country westerns. Silver foxes looking for romance. In the chain smoke Kansas flashdance ass pants. And you got the hotwax residues. You never lose in your razor blade shoes. Stealing pesos out of my brain. Hazard signs down the Alamo lanes. Radar systems using the souls. You never get caught with the wax so rotten. All my days I got the grizzly words. Hijacked flavors that I'm flipping like birds. Yo soy un disco cabrado*. Yo tengo chicle en cerabo. who are you?. I'm the enchanting wizard of rhythm. why did you come here?. I came here to tell you about the rhythms of the universe. *chorus translation: ""I'm a broken record I have bubblegum in my brain"""
tropicalia,when they beat. on a broken guitar. and on the streets. they reek of tropical charms. the embassies lie in hideous shards. where tourists snore and decay. when they dance in a reptile blaze. you wear a mask. an equatorial haze. into the past. a colonial maze. where there's no more confetti to throw. you didn't know what to say to yourself. love is a poverty you couldn't sell. misery waiting in vague hotels. to be evicted. you're out of luck. you're singing funeral songs. to the studs. they're anabolic and bronze. they seem to strut. in their millennial fogs. 'til they fall down and deflate. you didn't know what to say to yourself. love is a poverty you couldn't sell. misery waiting in vague hotels. to be evicted. now you've had your fun. under an air-conditioned sun. it's burned into your eyes. leaves you plain and left behind. see them eyes and fall. into the jaws of a pestilent love. you didn't know what to say to yourself. love is a poverty you couldn't sell. misery waiting in vague hotels. to be a victim.
morning,"Woke up this morning from a long night in the storm. Looked up this morning, saw the roses full of thorns. (Guns) (Bombs) (Mountains) are falling. they don't have nowhere to go. The ocean's a diamond. only shines when you're alone. Can we start it all over again this morning?. I lost all my defenses this morning. Won't you show me the way it used to be?. I've gone all around 'til there's nothing left to say. Wrote it all down into something that couldn't be said. I tore it all down and buried me underneath the wave. Can we start it all over again this morning?. I let down my defenses this morning. It was just you and me this morning. I fought all my guesses this morning. Won't you show me the way it could've been?"
the new pollution,She's got a cigarette on each arm. She's got the lily-white cavity crazes. She's got a carborator tied to the moon. Pink gods looking to the fruit of the ages. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's got a hand on a wheel of pain. She can talk to the mangling strangers. She can sleep in a fiery barn. Throwing troubles to the dying embers. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's alone in the new pollution. She's got a paradise camoflauge. Like a whip-crack sending me shivers. She's a boat through a strip-mine ocean. Riding low on the drunken rivers. She's alone in the new pollution.

I better go it alone. down on the corner. see me standin. on a makeshift road. with the dust storm blowin. in a long black shadow. pull a hammer from a coal mine. down where your daddy was workin. comb my hair back. strike a match on a bathroom wall. where my number was written. drivin on the sidewalk. lookin back and the sky is burning. in my rearview mirror.

Lay dead on the ground. Electricity. Trembled in the skys. Sparks shot forward. Causing us to fly. Take some breakfast. But the grit was in our food. And everywhere around us. Starvation broke on through. My husband stood a-starin. At the plentiful disaster. God was in his eyes. But death was in his heart. Dried up whiskey. Chickens in the house. Stolen car stereo. Cholesterol on your mouth. Stolen car stereo. Snowman all in flames. Deluxe cockroach. Telling me what's real. Black Sabbath playing. I wake up in my socks. Candle all a-burnin"

Never paid my rent 'til the lights went dead. And I saw my sign coming up the road. Dead ditch waitin' for to bury my load. On the avenues in the plain of day. Threw a Roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain. Ohh ohh oh oh. Ohh ohh oh oh. Now hold your hand up to the plow. Work the dirt til the sun goes down. What's left of death is more than fear. Let dust be dust and the good Lord near. It's a little too much to ask of faith. A little too late to wait for fate. So tell the angels what you've seen. Scarecrow's shadow on the Nazarene.

It's nothing that I haven't seen before. But it still kills me like it did before. No it's nothing that I haven't seen before. But it still kills me like it did before. I've seen the end of the day come too soon. Like the prison dogs they set out after you. You owe nothing to the past but wasted time. To serve a sentence that was only in your mind. In your mind.

fax machine anthem,"Looking for my place on assembly lines. Fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes. Skeleton boys hyped up in purple. Smoke rings blow from across the disco. Bank notes, burn like broken equipment. Looking for shelter via juxtaposition. Thought control, those written confessions. Two dimensions, dumb your head down. Duck, don't look now, company missiles.

Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs. Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates. (Please enjoy). Hell yes now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct. Stretched to the limit, attention spared. Snap back the track, collapsin' the laugh tracks. Noise response, applause and handclaps. Floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow. Makin' points on the verge of pointless. Fools anointed to the follower's fanfare. Look for the common, not superficial. Code Red Cola? War conformity crisis. Perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles. With magic markers running out of their ink. Lives and White Out, turn the lights out. Fax machine anthems; get your damned hands up. Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing. (Please enjoy). Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs. Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates.

ghettochip malfunction,"Looking for my place on assembly lines. Fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes. Skeleton boys hyped up in purple. Smoke rings blow from across the disco. Make notes, burn like broken equipment. Looking for shelter via juxtaposition. Thought control, those written confessions. Two dimensions, dumb your head down. Duck, don't look now, company missiles. Power is raunchy when the cops are watching. Make your dreams out of Papier-mache. Clinched wasted hate taste tested. Hell yes, now I'm moving this way. I'm doing this thing, please enjoy. Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs. Hell yes, now I'm calling you out. I'm switching my plates, please enjoy. Hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct. Hi, yeah, that's it, let me see. Yea, that's it, let me see. Yea, that's it, hi. Stretched to the limit, attention spared. Snap back the track, collapsin' the laugh tracks. Noise response, applause and hand claps. Floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow. Makin' points on the verge of pointless. Fools anointed to the follower's fanfare. Look for the common, not superficial. Code Red Cola? War conformity crisis. Perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles. With magic markers running out of their ink. Lives and White Out, turn the lights out. Fax machine anthems, get your damned hands up. Hell yes, now I'm moving this way. I'm doing this thing, please enjoy. Hell yes, now I'm turning it on I'm working my legs. Hell yes, now I'm calling you out. I'm switching my plates, please enjoy. Hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct.

girl,"I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied. Round the roses. Fist pounding on a vending machine. Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger. With a noose she can hang from the sun. And put it out with her dark sunglasses. Walking crooked down the beach. She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching. And I know I'm gonna steal her eye. She doesn't even know what's wrong. And I know I'm gonna make her die. Take her where her soul belongs. I know I'm gonna steal her eye. Nothing that I wouldn't try. Hey, my sunna girl. Hey, my sunna girl. My sunna girl. Hey, my sunna girl. I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back. And her rags were burning. Crawling out from a landfilled life. Scrawlin her name upon the ceiling. Throw a coin in a fountain of dust. White noise, her ears are ringing. Got a ticket for a midnight hanging. Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving. And I know I'm gonna steal her eye. She doesn't even know what's wrong. And I know I'm gonna make her die. Take her where her soul belongs. I know I'm gonna steal her eye. Nothing that I would not try. Hey, my sunna girl.

I better go it alone. down on the corner. see me standin. on a makeshift road. with the dust storm blowin. in a long black shadow. pull a hammer from a coal mine. down where your daddy was workin. comb my hair back. strike a match on a bathroom wall. where my number was written. drivin on the sidewalk. lookin back and the sky is burning. in my rearview mirror. I better go it alone

I break my back, I cry on the moon. goin nowhere fast."
got no mind,"(this is song two on the album. this is the album right here. burn the album). Tonight the city is turned off. Look at me, I'm wearing your shirt and it's burnt. Dissentious morons are dissing you, dissing me. Keeping the friendship in massive supply. That's why. I got no mind. I got no mind. I got no mind. Give the finger to the folk singer. I'm sure he'll appreciate it deeply. And where there's smoke. and there's grease and an unperfect peace. The free 'n' easy letdown will make it all come alive. That's why. I got no mind. I got no mind. I got no mind. That's why. I got no mind. I got no mind. I got no mind. Makeshift scene, mildly insulting. You really said it when you said I was just a scavenger.

I got no mind. I got no mind. got no mind. somebody burned down the picnic. and somebody kissed their own ass by mistake. and the cliches are gettin eaten up. by the termites with the malt liquor. and the guitar tuners and the Pussy Galore song. that's why. I play all night. I got no mind. feel so fine. . and the big radio sound is pumping up and down. jumpin thru the hoops. making every motion seem like forever. there's air conditioning and brand new nails. and phone calls from people in Chicago. ...why. pay no mind. got no mind. stay outside. so turn up the levels. and talk to your devils. and bust out your tennis shoes and your mayonnaise. it's all the situations and all the celebrations. and all the contaminations that make you. breed off the carpet. that's why.

I pay no mind. sleep in slime. put out CDs. the amplifiers are amplifying. the things that you never knew. could ever be the same as you. there's wires and plugs. and slugs slithering out into the paint thinner. that's why. I pay no mind. I pay no mind. got no mind. your swivel chairs and sunglasses. and your fully-blown out scenes of ecstasy. turn up the volume and the treble. and call them all the nasty things that you can. stick into your paper. with your pen. shove your pen up into the air. write everything and. like you just don't care. but it feels good. when you pull off the scenery. and there's puppets and dollar bills. and there's weight-loss pills. and there's cherries and there's potato chips. and the time is runnin low. and there's nowhere else to go. so let's go down. 666 up into. I'm raising all my lows.
guess i'm doing fine,There's a bluebird at my window. I can't hear the songs he sings. All the jewels in Heaven. They don't look the same to me. I just wade the tides that turned. Till i learn to leave the past behind. It's only lies that i'm living. It's only tears that i'm crying. It's only you that i'm losing. Guess i'm doing fine. All the battlements are empty. And the moon is laying low. Yellow roses in the graveyard. Got no time to watch them grow. Now i bade a friend farewell. I can do whatever pleases me. It's only lies that i'm living. It's only tears that i'm crying. It's only you that i'm losing. Guess i'm doing fine. Press my face up to the window. To see how warm it is inside. See the things that i've been missing. Missing all this time. It's only lies that i'm living. It's only tears that i'm crying. It's only you that i'm losing. Guess i'm doing fine. Guess i'm doing fine.

I have seen the the land beyond. I'll be there and I'll be gone. I have seen the the land beyond.

Steve came over and he brought some alcohol. we're all gettin really depressed just starin' at the wall. thought we'd get some money, we thought that we might go. spend a weekend pleasant down in Mexico. Steve's dad had a huntin' rifle and we went and picked it up. and we stopped into the 7-11 to try our luck. we raised up that huntin' rifle but the counter guy just laughed. as he pulled out an uzi we turned and hauled ass. we were runnin so fast 'til we came to the McDonalds where I used to work. we walked up to the drive thru and gave my boss a jerk. said give us all your money and three big macs to go. and suck on this you weasel we're goin to Mexico. down south we all got really wasted, Dave got a case of the runs. we're all really hungover and gettin low on funds.

minus,The last survivor of a boiled crown. Another casualty with the casual frown. The janitor vandals they bark in your face. Juveniles with the piles and paste. It's a sensation. A bankrupt corpse. In the garbage classes. With the crutches of frogs(?). Don't be confused when your fuse is up. And you're taking a leak into your brother's cup. When the cup is filled you can run and be killed. In the billion miles of the muscles that build. Radiation. Feeling the force. Karaoke. Vomiting morons. The scalps of zero hailing the call. Rubbing in a blind man's running mall(???). With the canker sores and the robot pills. Throwing imbeciles on the window sills. It's a sensation. A bankrupt corpse. In the garbage classes. With the crutches of frogs(?). Frogs!. Frogs!. Frogs!.

missing,MISSING. I prayed heaven today. would bring its hammer down on me. and pound you out of my head. I can't think with you in it. I dragged all that I owned. down a dirt road to find you. my shoes worn out and used. they can't take me much farther. something always takes the place of missing pieces. you can take and put together even though. you know there's something missing. the sun burned a hole in my roof. I can't seem to fix it. I hope the rain doesn't come. and wash me down the gutter. she rides in a car like a queen on a card. and the guns of her mind aim a line. straight at mine to a heart that was broke. tried to feel but got choked in the smoke of. a desert a beach with no treasure. a night that's so blue feed the aching in you and the background birds take a flight from the earth. where the bonfire burns and the night. current turns on a lifeboat floating. down a river of sleep. I can't see her hollow eyes. I'm walkin' along with my boots full of rocks. I can't believe these tears were mine. I'll give them to you to keep away in a box. something always takes the place of. missing pieces you can take and put together even though. you know there's something missing. something always missing always. someone missing something

modern guilt,"Hey, hey. Da, da, da, da. I feel uptight. When I walk in the city. I feel so cold. When I'm at home. Feels like everything's. Starting to hit me. I lost bed. Ten minutes ago.

morning,"Woke up this morning from a long night in the storm. Looked up this morning, saw the roses full of thorns. (Guns) (Bombs) (Mountains) are falling. they don't have nowhere to go. The ocean's a diamond. only shines when you're alone. Can we start it all over again this morning?. I lost all my defenses this morning. Won't you show me the way it used to be?. I've gone all around 'til there's nothing left to say. Wrote it all down into something that couldn't be said. I tore it all down and buried me underneath the wave. Can we start it all over again this morning?. I let down my defenses this morning. It was just you and me this morning. I fought all my guesses this morning. Won't you show me the way it could've been?"
motorcade,These toys are all lifeless. The armor's worn off. The shadow of a shadow. Is the ghost of a bomb. Skyscraper standing. In a desert alone. A helicopter searchlight. Is searching for no-one. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. The smokestack clouds with glory attached. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. The smokestack clouds with glory attached. The sky creatures dance. In a parking lot wind. That blows from a tundra. Where the jungle begins. If there's hope in a roadblock. Guns in a church. The lord will take his motorcade. And drive us into the dirt. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. The smokestack clouds with glory attached. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. The smokestack clouds with glory attached. There's a skyscraper on the moon. And a man standing on a window. Forty-second floor. There's a light beaming through the galaxy. Telling me everything's gonna be OK. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top. We're all pushing up the tin can mountain top
movie theme,Looking for a ladder. In the stratosphere. So I can be happy. Let my problems melt away. Running on a plane. With a cigarette. I carry my heart. Like a soldier with a hand grenade. Walking down the aisle. Of the supermarket. Looking for the ??. To carry my senses away. Listen to a voice. On the telephone. Somebody's calling. Somebody on the way. Looking for a home. In the magazine page. Wages in my pocket. Gonna buy me anything I need. Thought in my brain. Batting an eye. Washing away. ??. I'm not scared. 'Cause there's nobody there. Mind is awake. Nothing's gonna lead me astray. Listen to the voice. On the radio wave. Somebody needs you. Somebody who is. On their way

mystery song #1,"Baby, I can't make it straight. My boots got stuck and I can't wait. You're the one who's got no tongue. Look and see which way it's run. Man alive! I can't drive my two-bit cares away. Obituaries I seen right through. Brochures of the times we knew. Taxes on the days we spent. Repossessed and maimed and chained. Man alive! I can't drive my two-bit cares away. Accusation and suspects named. Battered husbands, cousins blamed. Holding up your trophy bones. Sticks and stones and lesser-knowns. Man alive! I can't drive my two-bit cares away. And all your hopes can be derailed. No salt in the seas you've sailed. No dreams in the night you lie. All the stars drip from the sky. Man alive! I can't drive my two-bit cares away. Man alive! I can't drive my two-bit cares away"
mystery song #2,"Well if it ain’t your time to go. Then you’d better stay put for now. Cuz everybody’s gotta do their time until it’s time. And if it ain’t broken, then break it. And say you knew me way back when. When fools were fools, and all rest were swine waiting to be defiled. Well I could hang up my single. Out by the side of the road. And try to bang a flame out of the cinders you left behind. Like a driftwood in the night. That was washed up by the light. Of the moon that bleached my bones. That sent me to the pile. Mustard in your smile. Lend a hand on the radio dial. And the breezes of the seasons. Have blown us back to hell. It’s a stolen telephone. That I dialed blind and alone. Just to hear the voice of a bargain center soul. Now the deserts are in flames. And the bandages are the same. And the factories, casualties are looking for mangled jewels. And if it ain’t your time to go. Then you’d better stay put for now. Cuz anybody gotta put their hand. Upon the hand of the clock. Like the minds of misers grinding down their gears to a halt"

In an Aztec ruin. With my minion fingers. Working for some God. Who could see his own reflection. In a parking lot. Oh it's nausea, oh nausea. And we're gone. No it's nausea, oh nausea. And we're gone. Now I'm a priest teenager. On a tower of dust. I'm a dead generator. In a cloud of exhaust. I eat alone in the desert. With skulls for my pets. I rate the days, one to ten. With lead cigarettes. It's nausea, oh nausea. And we're gone. It's nausea, oh nausea. And we're gone"
new round,When the ocean's are dark. The heavens are foreboding. A chain link wind. Is breaking you open. And lessons of day. On the blackboard of night. That seem to be erased. And the beacon has no light. The eyes of confusion. Looking for a stray. And everything they need. Keep the dogs at bay. There's no escape hatch. No submarine. Can take you to the moon. And rake you in the leaves. And keep you just as safe. As you are in my arms. And someday someday. Say bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. You're smaller than a stone. Bigger than a road. Farther than an ocean. Closer than a soul. Every little word. And every little step. Every new direction. Closer you will get. And farther away. You go from where we are. And try to keep him with you. And hold him like a star. That has fallen frozen lake. To a heart to break. And push yourself beyond. The wall that coffins you. When you bring it down. All the false sides. When you make him yours. Don't forget he's yours. Bye-bye

Chump scum plays in the razor's haze. Got the momentum radioactive. Lowdown!. Step aside for the operation. Don't expect some generation. Cyanide ride down the turnpike. Hundred hours on the miracle mic. Grinding the gears eighteen wheels. Pigs and robots riding on their heels. Fine tune road block making a sand box. Diesel infernos burning like drano. Down the horizon purple gasses. Semi-trucks hauling their asses. Novacane, hit the road expressway. Explode!. Novacane!. Novacane!."

How can I make ??. Or rust every time it rains?. And the rain, it comes. Floods are low. ???. If I wake up and see my maker coming. With all of his crimson and his iron desire.

painted eyelids,I wake up and look upon your painted eyelids. the world is your oyster. and the trashbags are your kids. the ceiling is invisible. there's a bird sinkin' through the sky. and every hour that passes. is teachin me how to cry. cuz it's lonely here. in the ugly part of town. the buildings are all vacant. and the telephones are down. there's a police siren singing. like a tiger with no skin. the sewer drain is glowing. and I don't know what state I'm in. and the river is on fire. there's chemicals in the breeze. and all the roads are blocked off. cuz they're just too hard to see. so cancel my appointments. and set up a whole new show. cuz I'm in need of a good hot meal. and a life to call my own. so get me a plate of money. and get me a blanket and a chair. the limitations are limitless. they're floating through the air. because it's real and it's true. the things I see in you. and there's nothing I wouldn't talk about.
paper tiger,Just like a paper tiger. Torn apart by idle hands. Through the helter skelter morning. Fix yourself while you still can. No more ashes to ashes. No more cinders from the sky. All the laws of creation. Tell a dead man how to die. O deserts down below us. And storms up above. Like a stray dog gone defective. Like a paper tiger in the sun. Looking through a broken diamond. To make the past what it should be. Through the ruins and the weather. Capsized boats in the sea. O deserts down below us. And storms up above. Like a stray dog gone defective. Like a paper tiger in the sun. Weæ± e just holding on to nothing. To see how long nothing lasts. O deserts down below us. And storms up above. Like a stray dog gone defective.

And I noticed the crew and the band playin' down below. And I realized I was in a rock video. So I went and joined the band. And I went out on tour. And I smoked a lot of heroin. And I passed out in manure. I made out with the groupies. Come on here. Started fires backstage. Oh, yeah, started 'em all. Made a lot of money. Oh, yeah, I'm makin' it. And I gave it all away. Give it all to me. Well, the band got killed. Ah, bunch of losers. So I started a solo career. Aha, yeah. And I won all the awards. Get 'em all now. And I drank all the beer.

slip out (littlemore than before),"I don't know since when I changed to such a cold-hearted guy. I have to warm this frozen, icy, lonely heart to thaw. I like being wrapped with warmness more than anything else for sure. I'm gonna make my coming days to be filled with laughter and joy. I let myself down that I'm more cruel than I thought I would be. I'm just a loser who ends up by caring for my soul. I don't give my heart to no one cause I don't wanna waste my time. I tried to love this loneliness to slip out of lonesome hole. Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown by sensations. Regrets tought me how to make any hard decisions. Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once. Love is not the word only for the sweet romance. Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death. And I'm scared to keep on going on my way. Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death. And I'll tell myself I'm special 'till the end. Recalling my torn, broken, aching heart of these long days. And all the memories I wanted to forget for making leaps. Recalling, breaking, aching, crying, making sure to me. And I take all and grin at my future on the way. Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown by sensations. Regrets tought me how to make any hard decisions. Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once. Love is not the word only for the sweet romance. Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death. And I'm scared to keep on going on my way. Well I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death. And I'll tell myself I'm special 'till the end.... I don't give my heart to no one cause I don't wanna waste my time. I tried to love this loneliness to slip out of lonesome hole. Letra adicionada por P.H. Zaltbohr. 23/08/06"

soldier jane,"Nobody cares what dress she wears at all. Tattered rags and paper bags and all. She's the one sleeping in the dirt. Drag her down, don't let her drown in dirt. Gamblers trade candles for the dice. Mothers drag their canes across the bridge. No one wake her up, she's sleeping still. Put a candle on the window sill. Soldier Jane, don't be afraid. Taking heart out of the shell. Taking heart out of the shell. Throw it away. ?? strike the darkness from the room. Knives, they take the poison from the wound. 'Cause they drag us down into the ruins. Sleep away our cares, dirty boots. Soldier Jane, don't be afraid. Taking heart out of the shell. Taking heart out of the shell. Throw it away"

'til a hooker let me share her fake fur coat. as I took a little nap the cops picked up us both. I tried to explain I was only tryin' to get warm.

square one,"I've been watching the wheels turning. But I'm learning to enjoy the ride. On the road to nowhere. I hope we get there soon. 'cause it's a place we've been before.

And when I got to the dark side of the moon. All the trouble I thought I knew. It left me out in the cold. Spinning out of control on a broken carousel. Now tell me this is life and it's alright. Chasing windmills in your mind. You'll be fine if you try. To keep your eyes on the consolation prize. On the road to tomorrow. Gonna have to beg, steal, or borrow. It's all a part of the plan. When you're dead to the world. And you're going down hard for the girl. For the girl. For the girl. For the girl. For the girl. See you on the other side of love all alone.

I took a leap into the fog. sleepin' on a hollow log. now I'm coughin' with no mouth. you can keep yourself inside. but you know you cannot lie."

strange apparition,"Lord, please don't forsake me. In my Mercedes Benz. All the riches and the ruins. Now we all know how that story ends. Strange apparition. Haunting my brain. Standing on the last legs. Of a dream that walked away. When the Lord rings my front door. And asks me what I got to show. Besides the dust in my pockets. And the things that just eat away my soul.

But it makes me kinda nervous to say so. I think I'm in love. But it makes me kinda nervous to say so. What if it's wrong?. What if it's wrong. To pray in vain?. What does it mean. To fake your death?. To wake up tainted?. Take a little picture in a photobooth. Keep it in a locket and I think of you. Both of our pictures, face to face. Take off your necklace and throw it away. I think I'm in love. But it makes me kinda nervous to say so. I think I'm in love. But it makes me kinda nervous to say so. Really think I better get a hold of myself.

Think I'm in love. Think I'm in love. Think I'm in love. Think I'm in love. Think I'm in love. Think I'm in love"
this girl that i know,"Laser animator. Add another to the breaker. On a broken escalator. We could get what we need. 'Cause it's a night of confessions. Electric progressions. Honorable mentions. Get a bouquet of weeds. And everybody moving. Like they know what they are doing. Push a weight against a wall. In a stifling room. City's in shambles. Untangle the tangles. People get together. To uncover the ruins. This girl that I know. I met her at a Minutemen show. She used to work for a literary journal. But she's really into hiphop. This girl that I know. I met her at a Commodores show. She kind of brushed me off. But I think she likes movies from France. Just like a lone dancer. In a motion disaster. With a chrome ghettoblaster. We just do what we feel. Even if it's atrocious. There's no hope for the hopeless. If there's nothing to cope. We get a rhythm that's real. Like a Tuesday commuter. With a dirty computer. We see the future hanging out. At a monoxide vibe. Habits are forming. Like cigarettes boring. To a smoker in the morning. Pulling butts from the ground. This girl that I know. I met her at a Sonic Youth show. I like her style. She's got that ?? burning ??. This girl that I know. I met her at a Jodeci show. She was looking good, you know"

thunder peel,"It's a cold ass fashion when she stole my passion. It's an everlasting, it's a ghettoblasting. On the wonderwheel I let my thunder peel. I made an effort to get just what I deserve. I got all maxed out, I got faxed some doubt. I was jumping around, she was a runnin' coming down. In the thick of a trick, I couldn't take my pick. Between a slime and a fist just to cool off your dog. I'm taking morphine[?]. Now I'm rolling in sweat. With a loaf of cold bread. And a taco in my jeans. On the map if you glide. She's got such ugly thighs. I got taken by surprise. With the plate of flaming noodles. It's a cold ass fashion when she stole my passion. It's an everlasting, it's a ghettoblasting. On the wonderwheel I let my thunder peel. I made an effort to get just what I deserve."

waitin' for a train,"All around the water tank, waitin' for a train. A thousand miles away from home, sleeping in the rain. I walked up to the brakeman, just to give him a line of talk. He said if you've got money, I'll see that you don't walk. I haven't got a nickel, not a penny to my name. Get off, get off you railroad bum, and he slammed the boxcar door. He put me off in Texas, the place I dearly love. Wide open spaces all around me, the moon and stars up above. Nobody seemed to want me, or lend me a helping hand. I'm on my way from Frisco, I'm going back to Dixie land. Though my pocket book is empty, and my heart is full of pain."

Day is gone on a landslide of rhythm. It's in your lamplight burning low. When the memory leaves you. Somewhere you can't make it home. When the morning comes to meet you. Rest your eyes in waking light. When the memory leaves you. Somewhere you can't make it home. When the morning comes to meet you. Open your eyes with waking light"
walls,Some days. I get a thrill. In my brains. Some days ??. See a face. Into the mirror. Reflecting. On the surface of fear. Because you know. I'm never better. Than that. Some days are worse.

When those walls. Are falling down. Falling down on you?. You got warheads. Stacked in the kitchen. You treat distraction. Like an instant religion. The battlesticks snap. At the rhythm. You give your best. With the souls. You've been given. 'Cause you know. You're nothing. Special to them. Going someplace. You've already been. Trying to make sense. Of what. They call wisdom. And this riff-raff. Life ain't with them. Hey. What are you gonna do. When those walls. Are falling down. Falling down on you?. Hey. What are you gonna do. When those walls. Are falling down.

wave,I move away from this place. In the form of a disturbance. And enter into the world. Like some tiny distortion. If I surrender. And I don't fight this wave. No I won't go under. I'll only get carried away. Wave. Wave. Wave. Isolation. Isolation. Isolation. Isolation
we dance alone,Send a telegram. Tell me your thoughts. I want to live for a day. And the way that we lost. But a ?? under the train. Got crissed not crossed. Left the keys in the car.

I did my best for you. Doo doo doo doo doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo. Doo doo doo doo doo doo. Darker. We dance alone this way. It's getting darker. We dance alone this way. I waited for a fire. To collide with the planet. Tried to get back on the world. As it was turning around. ?? pieces. ?? crashed. Watching every minute. Of the ?? passed. 'Cause motions wearing down. All my thoughts. 'Til they're all smoothed out. Like rocks were tossed. Nooks and ??. We descended on the reality. Down below. Darker. We dance alone this way. It's getting darker. We dance alone this way. I'm gonna grab a train. Gonna break the hope. I put the life beating out. Like a stray in a boat. Let the scenery pass. Like a blown-out TV. Thought I saw a ghost. But it might have been me. Might have been the world. That was moving too fast. Caught up in the future. That was coming to pass. Now looking for a place. Where the lights unravel. Last ditch road. Trespassers travel on. Darker. We dance alone this way. It's getting darker. We dance alone this way. We dance alone this way

will i be ignored by the lord?,"when I was born, lot's of people sayin' I looked like a dead man. but to them there was no kindness. and so I came into the world with my hands in my jacket. made a whole lotta racket. couldn't speak, but I could beat on a stick. oh, when that aeroplane comes with the Lord. will I be ignored. will I be ignored by the Lord. will I be ignored. there was a woman, she looked on me sweetly. I needed her life to be with mine. but never will they meet. no, never will they see. these two vines will twist away, away. will I be ignored by the Lord. will I be ignored by the Lord, by the Lord. what for? I may travel on one leg. my breakfast will be unpaid. and the flapjacks will flap back off the ceiling onto my head. will I be ignored. will I be ignored by the Lord."
wow,"[Intro]. Giddy up, giddy it up. Giddy up, giddy up. [Verse 1]. Wanna move into a fool's gold room. With my pulse on the animal jewels. Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose. With the luminous moves. Bored of these limits, let me get, let me get it like. [Chorus]. Wow!. It's like right now. It's like wow!. It's like right, right now. It's like wow!. It's like right now. It's like wow!. It's like right now. Oh wow. [Verse 2]. It's my life, your life. Live it once, can't live it twice. So nice, so nice. Song's like a tidal wave, take you on a getaway. My friends, your friends. Love 'em every day like it's just about to end. Now we're pissin' in the wind cause it's so pine fresh. Like now. Yeah I, I wanna get it like. [Chorus]. Wow!. It's like right now. It's like wow!. It's like. Giddy up!. Wow!. It's like right now. Wow!. Oh wow, it's like right now. [Verse 3]. It's your life. Falling like a hot knife. Call your wife; secular times, these times. My demon's on the cell phone. To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong. It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes boom. Standing on a line doin' jiu jitsu. Girl in the bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu. [Bridge]. It's your life. You gotta try to get it right. Look around, don't forget where you came from. It's just another perfect night. We're gonna take it around the world. We're gonna take it around the world. When this one is over. I lose my emotions. We're gonna take it around the world. [Outro]. Like. Wow, wow, wow. Like. Giddy up!. Giddy up!. Wow!"
youthless,"There's a bottomless pit that we've been climbing from. Just to get on level ground. Shake your seasick legs around. Dead of winter in a logo town. Signs of life are soft and flickering. Need a bed to lay my body down. Deadweight that you carry round. The static is lulling me to sleep. Hang your clothes on a chain link fence. In a junkyard, say amen. Your mouth is full of wordless hymns. And run-on sentences. And they're helpless. And forgetting in the background. Holding nothing. And they're youthless. And pretending. With their bare hands. Holding nothing. There's a million horses dragging down a monolith. These trademarks so bereaved. Tied my leg to a barricade. With a plastic hand grenade. That tried to turn emotion into noise. Need a teleprompter for my life. Need a pipeline to the night. My body can't get no relief. And this life, it goes by fast. You're treading water in the past. Trying to re-animate something. That you can't understand. And they're helpless. And forgetting in the background. Saying nothing. And he's youthless. And forgetting. With his bare hands. Tied to nothing. And he's helpless. And forgetting in the background. Giving nothing. That is youthless. Trembling. With his bare hands. Holding nothing"
zatyricon,"Hello, can I help you?. Yeah, do you do fat grafting?. Yes.. Oh great. I had a tail put on by Dr. Gordon.. OK.. And I want to have some fat grafted onto it. I want to thick it up.. You have some fat where?. Well, I have a tail attached to my spine and I want to thicken it up. I want it to be bigger.. Oh.. Would that be the botox injection? Or would that be the fat grafting?. OK, hold on a second. I don't think you have the right person.. OK, no problem.. Thanks for holding. May I help you?. Hi, yeah. I had a tail put on about 4 years ago, attached to my spine and I've got some hair growing on it that I need to get.... Well, come and get rid of it!. That's why I'm calling you! Can I come in tonight?. Actually, you can come in for a consultation. Let me tell you how we work here.. OK, please.. Sure. First of all, one session is not going to get rid of your hair. That's because hair grows in three phases. All human bodies need at least three sessions of laser treatment. And I say ""at least"" because if you're talking about let's say your beard, you may need up to eight.. Well, this is my tail.. Right, so then you obviously will need less. But I just want to educate you about, you know, different body parts.. Right.. So depending on the amount of hair you have, it will tell you how many sessions you will need.. But here is the best part of how we work.. What's that?. We offer you different types of enrollment. So if, let's say, we quote you a price... let's say, fifty dollars. You can pay as you go, every time you come in, fifty dollars. Or if you pay for three sessions up front, we will give you two complementary sessions. And that's our way of guaranteeing that your hair won't come back. Because we definitely don't want to see you five times for the same area. We try to give you the type of treatment that's gonna be effective. So if we do see you, hopefully it will be for a different body part.. [phone is ringing.]. Do you need to get the other line?. Umm, no, let's let it go. I'm fascinated by what you're saying. [snort]. OK, so this is what we do here. You come in, you watch a five-minute video, because we like our patients to be astute about what they're getting into. We do guarantee the lowest price, that the machine we use is the latest technology in the market today for hair removal. And we basically take a deposit from you because without the deposit we cannot book the time of the machine for your use.. OK.. And that's how we work.. That sounds great. I see here upper lip is 29 dollars, underarm is $39, bikini line $49, arm $119.. Yep.. How much for a tail?. Umm, it really depends. It really depends. It really.... It's about four feet long.. Four feet?. Yeah.. OK. You're talking about your head, right? Your head tail?. No. I have a tail attached to my spine.. A tail attached to your spine? On the lower spine?. Yeah.. And that was because of a surgery?. Yeah.. I see. And uh, ok, when you say four feet. .four feet is the length of your hair?. No, it's the length of my tail.. Wow. That's a long tail.. And you guys just do laser hair removal?. No, actually we do microderm abrasion. We do lazer resurfacing. We do body contouring with endymology.. Do you do botox injections?. I'm a semi-amateur bodybuilder and weightlifter.. Then you should do your whole chest, your back, your legs!. Well, I want my face just to look like, you know, like, like care, you know.. I know what you mean.. Let me tell you how it works. They take a virus, they beat it up with a hammer, literally. OK, they make you weak, then they inject that weak virus into your muscle. Botulism virus causes paralysis, ok? So it basically temporarily paralyzes a muscle. Usually facial muscles, whatever.. Right.. Well, here's what happens. The body's normal reaction to a traditional virus is antibody release. OK, so now antibodies are going to come up to fight this virus.. You know what? I don't have time for this. I'm not wasting time here.. OK, I'm a semi-amateur weightlifter and I've got a competition coming out. And I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do. I look like an idiot. She injected the botox into my face and it completely killed my face."
