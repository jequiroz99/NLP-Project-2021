Daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby. Everything's gonna be alright. The Lord's gonna answer your prayer. Last night I had a dream you was the homecoming queen. Today you're 18, happy birthday Irene. Quit school you had to drop out to raise your little child. Doesn't seem to be anyone around. You got to reach up to touch rock bottom. The powers that be keep you downtrodden. Daughter of Zion, I heard your prayer. Just cast your cares and please beware of snakes. They come in all shapes and sizes. Tempt you, put scales on your eyelids. Don't waste your sorrows. They'll give you strength ... tomorrow. Your Calvary's about to come so. Keep your head up, don't you ever let up. This storm will pass you be ready for the next one. Hey little girl with the pressures of the world on your shoulders. Don't say that it's over. I heard your prayers, just cast your cares. And I'll be there so don't you fear. [Chorus]. Irene I carried you when you was too weak to walk. I took to you when you gave your heart to God. Faithful and true, that's what I'll always be to you. Believe in you, believe in Me and these mountains have to move. You have dreams and aspirations. I knew you before creation. Your foundation's solid. I will give you a palace, restore your soul. You'll be up for any challenge. Many storms are on the way better sharpen your faith. Count the cost, take up your cross. And wear it every day. Rest in Me and I will give you strength. Blessed is she, Irene who seeks my face. [Chorus]. Father I'm stronger than when I first believed"

I need U every single day, every breath I take. I need U"

When the sun won't shine and you don't know why. Look into the eyes of the broken hearted. Watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope you speak love. Speak life, speak life. Some days the tongue gets twisted, other days my thoughts just fall apart. I do, I don't, I will, I won't. It's like I'm drownin' in the deep. Well it's crazy to imagine words from our lips as the arms of compassion. Mountains crumble with every syllable, hope can live or die. Lift your head a little higher. Spread the love like fire. Hope will fall like rain when you speak life with the words you say. Raise your thoughts a little higher. Use your words to inspire. Joy will fall like rain when you speak life with the things you say. Lift your head a little higher. Spread the love like fire. Hope will fall like rain when you speak life with the words you say"

I was blinded by my selfish dreams. Everything ain’t what it seems. From inside to out, there ain’t no doubt. I been changed. NOTHING SHORT OF satisfaction. Your love caused a change reaction.

But then You whispered my name. And I heard the truth but never from Your lips. Bought the lies of many counterfeits. Dreamed my dreams, but they were never in color. And I searched for You and many others. I was down for the count. Then I saw Your face. Just a glimpse of Your face, and my whole world changed. Then I saw Your face, and I was changed forever. Changed forever now. Then I saw Your face. One glimpse of Your face, it’s a whole new game. Then I saw Your face, and I was changed forever. Yours forever now. If I could reach the stars, I could touch the sky. And if I spread my wings, I could almost fly. I had everything paper could buy. I was lost in my disguise. And if I played my role, they would feel my style. If I bought the night they would buy my smile. I’ve been runnin’ this game for a million miles. Believin’ my own lies. I was down, I was out. I was blinded by my selfish dreams. Everything ain’t what it seems. From inside to out, there ain’t no doubt. I been changed. NOTHING SHORT OF satisfaction. Your love caused a change reaction. I can tell you this much I FELT your touch. And I’m changed. When I was down for the count, YOUR love surrounded me. Blink of an eye. I saw my destiny. Change, rearranged ‘cause I couldn’t maintain. The heart it took to even stay in the game. One look in Your eyes even I realized. A fellow like me had been put down to size. To be built up in a better way, Your way. Yahweh ain’t about to fade. Bombastic, ain’t no way to mask it. I saw Your face, and my old way’s blasted. I’m Yours forever now"

face of the earth,Face Of The Earth. It’s been a long time coming. Since I saw your face. Since we held it down. Since we were in the chase. It was the road less traveled. The path less formed.

Young refugees but we were momma’s pearls. Where you been dog? Where you been?. I thought you fell of the face of the earth …. It’s been way too long and we’ve come to far. For you drop out my life like a falling star. Right off my radar. Not a sign or a trace. You know I had love for you that’s bigger than mistakes. Now Hope road is calling. Let’s pack you up and move. ‘Cause real friends are willing to intrude. So I’m gonna push in cause I wanna love you well. Let the ghosts of your past rest. Open up the door. This is the first day of the rest of your life. What are you waiting for?. This is the first day of the rest of your life. Open up the door. To life …. (spoken). Behold I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door. I will come in …

hey devil,"he dialed him about 6:00 pm. She checked her hair in the mirror. And she stepped through the door like this. Three flights down. And she's out on the streets. Walking brick sidewalks lined in grey concrete. He saw her coming from a few blocks away. Red scarf in the wind as it started to rain a bit. Shuffled down the boulevard. Cut me like a deck of cards. I thought you had me. You thought that you had me. But hey, Devil, go on. Get your junk out of here. I don't need you. I don't need you. Hey, Devil, go on. Get your junk out of here. I don't need you. So move on. I stepped to it like I knew what I was doing. I'm a moth. You're the flame. Never knew you'd be my ruin. In the blink of an eye. Element of surprise. Got my feet on the earth. But my face to the sky. Shuffled down the boulevard. Cut me like a deck of cards. I thought you had me. You thought you had me. Now the plot is thickening. Pushing deep under my skin. I thought you had me. You that that you had me. You're a beauty and A beast. You're the pressure never cease. You're the straight other side. And they say you never sleep. by: Cida Koizumi"

Hey now, one love, one God out of many his people. Right now it's been a long time comin'. But I'm serving up the sequel. Back from the day, I'm the sleeper done slumbering.

hold on,"Wake up to the morning light. Wipe away the lonely nights. Let a brand new day wash over you. Wanna see you smile again. Show some love to your crazy friends. Wipe your tears away, those days are through. If you move just a little bit closer. You can put your head on my shoulder. Yeah, yeah. So baby hold on. Just another day or two. I can see the clouds are moving faster now. And the sun is breaking through. If you could hold on. To the One that’s holding you. There is nothing that can stop this crazy love. From breaking through, we’re breaking through. Wake up to the rising sun. Thank the Lord for the things He’s done. Lift your eyes to the hope that’s ever true. Wanna see you smiling girl. You’re a light in this jaded world. Wipe away those tears. This one’s for you. And the stars are up there shining for you. Oh, how the Father does adore you. His love will never change. And you and I, we were born to follow. The hope that will lead us to tomorrow. And no one can take it away"
horizon (a new day),"I feel the blood rushin' through my veins. I'm ready for change. They keep telling me to stay in my lane. But it's screaming my name. My heart is racin'. The elements we're facin'. Got us pushing through the night. I feel the pressure. But when we come together. We'll journey 'til the morning light. It's our destiny. No separating us 'cause we're family. Beautiful together I do believe. We can do anything in His name. A new day. A new day is on the horizon. A new day. A new day is on the horizon. If you can see it, I can see it. We can be it, better believe. Ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way. A new day. A new day is on the horizon. Thicker than blood, thicker than earthsuit ties. So deep and wide. There's comin' a day, comin' a day we're gonna rise up. We won't give up the fight. Takin' all that we are and binding it forever. Together never severed we are deeper than the skin we're in. Our creed, our culture, even our names. Fall straight into the shadows of the depths of how we relate. A body, a family, different parts but one in the same. Spiritual shame it can not clinch us. 'Cause the love we have is different. You can say what you say. But nothin' can stand in the way. Of the rising on the horizon. Open your eyes to a new day. Rise up if you're tired of the replay. And fists high if you're ready for a new day"

i just need u,"Last night put the heavy on me. Woke up, and I'm feeling lonely. This world gotta a way of showin' me. Some days it'll lift you up. Some days it'll call your bluff. Man, most of my days I ain't got enough. And all I know is you're my only hope. When I'm up, when I'm down. When the wolves come around. When my feet hit the ground. I just need, I just need U. On my darkest days. When I'm losing faith. No, it ain't gonna change. I just need, I just need U. Lord, I need U. Yeah, I just need U. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff. They comfort me when I'm beat down broken. Hold my heart when it's split wide-open. Turn these eyes to my sole protector. And break the will of this born defector. When you pull me closer I come to life. Ain't no way this thing gon' change, it's U. I need on my darkest days. When I'm losing faith. I need U every single day, every breath I take. I need U"

I've been workin' all morning trying to spin my dream. Cause I just can't believe you weren't in my dream. Remember you and I said we would paint the sky. And the leaves on the trees and the stars at night. We made beats and we even wrote rhymes. And played golf, I think, a million times. Now we never got around to spiritual matters. But we sure made time for our mindless chatter. [CHORUS]. I wanna see you there. In the the air. One day we'll be singin' (Hallelujah). I wanna see you there. In the the air.

And now my friends are jumpin'. and shouting outside our door. I growled at her and pulled the covers up over my head. She laughed and slammed a pillow on my face. and shook my bed. She said I might just wanna peek out the window. Sat up and squinted, took a peek out the window. It snowed it snowed it snowed. today let's go out and play. It snowed it snowed it snowed... today. Hallelujah, snow angels rejoice. Let your wings unveil and lift your voice. I grabbed my toboggan and boots. and I was out the door. I didn't know that I was walking right into a war. Sliding down that icy walk feelin' chill like outer space. Turned in time to catch a snowball right upside my face. My feet they slipped and suddenly I was up in the air. I hit the ground... laughter came from everywhere. I jumped right up and joined the making. of this joyful sound. And then we all fell back. and waved our arms and legs around. It snowed it snowed it snowed. today let's go out and play. It snowed it snowed it snowed... today. Hallelujah, snow angels rejoice. Let your wings unveil and lift your voice.

jesus freak,"Separated, I cut myself clean. From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams. Been apprehended by a spiritual force. And a grace that replaced all the me I've divorced. I saw a man with tat on his big fat belly. It wiggled around like marmalade jelly. It took me a while to catch what it said. Cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head. 'Jesus Saves' is what it raved in a typical tattoo green. He stood on a box in the middle of the city. And claimed he had a dream. What will people think. When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak. What will people do when they find that it's true. I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak. There ain't no disguising the truth. [There ain't no disgusing the truth]. [I don't need to hide it... The truth]. Kamikaze, my death is gain. I've been marked by my Maker. A peculiar display. The high and lofty, they see me as weak. Cause I won't live and die for the power they seek. There was a man from the desert with naps in his head. The sand that he walked was also his bed. The words that he spoke made the people assume. There wasn't too much left in the upper room. With skins on his back and hair on his face. They thought he was strange by the locusts he ate. The Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak. Until the king took the head of this Jesus freak. What will people think. When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak. What will people do when they find that it's true. I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak. There ain't no disguising the truth. People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger. That my best friend was born in a manger. People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger. That my best friend was born in a manger. What will people think. When they hear that I'm a Jesus freak.

Two turntables and a plate full of collards. Royalty checks we flex with few dollars. But my DJ makes the people wanna holler. CHORUS. Love is in the house, and the house is packed. So much soul I left the back door cracked. Mamma always said it's a matter of fact. When love is in the house the house is packed. Love is in the house, and the house is packed. So much soul I left the back door cracked. Daddy always said that I wish I was black. Love is in the house and the house is packed. Packed like a baby nine months in the womb.

Government checks, they flex in big dollars. Two palm pilots and a room full of ballers. Royalty checks we flex with few dollars. But amazing grace makes the people wanna holler.

no ordinary love,"Momma never said it would be like this. I never knew such bliss existed. Or maybe it’s just so indescribable. Love was liable to get her twisted. She never told me but if she tried I was a little too young it floated right by me. I never dreamed love so fulfilling it’s simply killing and over spilling on me. It goes on and on …. This ain’t no ordinary love. Gonna tell everyone up under the sun. I refuse to believe we’re a dying breed. Children of peace hope and harmony. Ordinary folks extraordinary love. Something from above. Something we fall short of. You can’t see with an untrained eye. But if you take a little time you are sure to find it. We complicate something so basic. But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me. It goes on and on …. A - yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow …. Love’s gonna take us higher. This ain’t no ordinary love. It’s extraordinary love"

So turn off the lights, pass me the mic. Bring on the lights, they’ve been waiting all night for the. It’s automatic. Don’t want no static. I’m a fanatic, Jesus fanatic.

somebody's watching,"Suggestions, questions. People want to know. Is there life after talk. Cause there's talk on the road. Twistin' words that I've never even said. To the ones that I trust. Or my ""Boo"" in our bed. Will he make it, I bet he won't. As they're runnin' through the minutes. On their cell phones. So the picture's painted. You got the point. And that junk's creepin' into my solo joint. Sometimes I feel God in the middle of the night. In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight. I always feel like somebody's watching me. Watch baby, watch baby, He got my back. See I'm down with the King. So I got it like that. It's no joke, I've been roped in. Chokin' on a bone. From a fist in the school of your twilight zone. You shook me, took me to another place. Where the air I'm breathin's like mace in my face. If this controversy is your way. You need to know I'll never doubt my destiny. 'Cause I'm stickin' to my guns like a. Son of the Light. Feelin' Dad, I'm feelin' Daddy in the air tonight. Sometimes I feel grace in the middle of the night. In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight. And sometimes I feel God in the middle of the night. In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight."
speak life,"Speak Life. Some days life feels perfect, other days it just ain't workin'. The good, the bad, the right, the wrong, and everything in between. It's crazy, amazing, we can't turn a heart through the words we say. Mountains crumble with every syllable, hope can live or die. So speak life. To deadest darkest night. Speak life, speak life. When the sun won't shine and you don't know why. Look into the eyes of the broken hearted. Watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope you speak love. Speak life, speak life. Some days the tongue gets twisted, other days my thoughts just fall apart. I do, I don't, I will, I won't. It's like I'm drownin' in the deep. Well it's crazy to imagine words from our lips as the arms of compassion. Mountains crumble with every syllable, hope can live or die. Lift your head a little higher. Spread the love like fire. Hope will fall like rain when you speak life with the words you say. Raise your thoughts a little higher. Use your words to inspire. Joy will fall like rain when you speak life with the things you say. Lift your head a little higher. Spread the love like fire. Hope will fall like rain when you speak life with the words you say"
start somewhere,"Last night, everything was movin’ so fast. I could barely keep track. Oh, of my offenses or your defenses. In hindsight, I woulda, coulda, shoulda not gone there. But left without a word to spare. Was it your offenses or my defensiveness?. That’s got me thinkin’ that we’re never gonna get it right. I wanna straighten this before the sun goes down tonight. If I could only fight the bitterness I feel inside. This thing is eatin’ me alive. Well I’m right here. And you’re right there. And God knows we’ve got to start somewhere. ‘Cause I’m messed up. And you’re broken. And those shots we fired are still smokin’. I’m tossin’ and turnin’ on the things I’d undo. As I wrestle with the painful truth. Oh, my sleep escapes me as guilt berates me. Exhausted, the memories are drawing so near. I can see it like a world premiere. When did my objective lose all objectiveness?. If I need you, and you need me. How can you turn your back and just leave me?. When I’m right here, and you’re right there. And God knows we’ve got to start somewhere. I said some things that I regret. And if I could, I’d take ‘em back. If I could turn my words around. You wouldn’t hear a sound. But here I am, and there you are. The space between us is not so far. I’m reaching out my hand in love. Before the fading sun, forgive me for what I’ve done. Hey, hey …. “The gun shot’s gotta go, man. That’s it. I mean, enough is enough. Good grief …”. by: Cida Koizumi"
stories (down to the bottom),"We've been down to the bottom. Stories we got 'em, when we hit rock bottom. If you been there put your hands in the air. To let the lost know that someone cares. Cause we've been down to the bottom. Stories we've got 'em, when we hit rock bottom. If you been there put your hands in the air. And let somebody know that the Most High cares. I never knew that it would feel like this. When the two that raised you up and call it quits. Nobody told me'bout the emptiness. When the place you call home is closed for business. I push the pain down, I gotta ""get by"". Always knowin' in my heart that it ain't gonna fly. Rock bottom's never felt so near before. And if pain is God's megaphone it's loud and clear. So hold me now father, human love ain't enough. I've failed and been failed by the people I love. But your faithful arms they surround me. And any other soul who has to sail those seas. Of a broken family. Been so many times that I've been close to rock. bottom. Tryin' to look for answers but nobody's got 'em. Like the time my mother looked me in the eye. Tryin' not to cry, tellin' me the cancer might cause her to die. How can this be, I thought that God loved me?. So why would he try to take my mother from me?. And as I cry myself to sleep at night, holding on my pillow tight. He spoke to me and said that everything gonna be. alright. So I tried to fight all the pain that it caused. Try to move on and I try to stay strong. So put your hands up, hey, if y'all are feelin' me. And put your hands up for everyone to see. So put your hands up, we all a family. So put your hands up, in unity, in unity. I've been there too. When everything falls apart and the best you can do is. Get through each day wonderin' will this never end?. Is it always going to be this way?. And the greatest lie you've ever been told is that. You're the only one to ever walk on this road. And that you'll never see the light of dawn,. so we came together to say Hold on. Cause we've been there and found our way home. I promise you that you're not on your own. One day this will pass, God will see us all through. God will see us all through, God will see us all pass through"

And suddenly the skies open above you. And someone really loves you. Now everything's alive ... everything's alive. She's there broken into pieces. But he swares he doesn't really see it.

the first noel (feat. owl city),"Born is the king, born is the king. The first noel, the angels did say. Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay. In fields where they lay keeping their sheep. On a cold winter’s night that was so deep. Born is the king, born is the king. Noel, noel, noel, noel. Born is the king of israel. Noel, noel, noel, noel. Born is the king of israel. They looked up and saw a star. Shining in the east beyond them far. And to the earth it gave great light. And so it continued both day and night.

the slam,"God’s in the spot you can like it or not. So rip the knob off the volume when you give this a shot. And raise your hands as the slam starts to thicken the plot. Openin’ eyes to the lies of the enemies’ lot. So run like the wind from the sin of your past. Keep your eyes on the prize when they put you on blast. It’s the Christ on the cross, it’s humanity’s shot. It’s a worldwide call to everything that we’re not. This is the slam, this is the one. This is the slam, this is the one. This is the slam, this is the one. We gonna do it like it ain’t been done before. This is the slam, this is the one. We gonna bring it like it ain’t been brung. This is the slam, this is the one. We gonna do it like it ain’t been done before. This is the slam this is the one. We gonna spring you like you ain’t been sprung. They came from the cities and towns all around. To see the longhaired preacher from the desert get down. Waist high in water, never short on words, he said. Repent, the kingdom of heaven can be yours. But he stopped in the middle of his words and dropped. Down to his knees and said, behold the Lamb of God. He’s the one, the slam, don’t you people understand?. You’re staring at the son, God’s reaching out his hand. The father slammed it like Shaq. For Latinos and Blacks. Packin’ them straps. And Caucasians hooked on Ecstasy and the crack. Stacked the sins of this world to his body. And conquered evil and hell. Then snatched the keys of death. In one breath and unlocked the cell. He rose on the third. I’m tellin’ you partner, its actual fact. Just like TOBYMAC and Boney Soprano up on this track. We slam dunkin’ and keep it jumpin’ like jumper cables. And keep the crowd rowdy. Like Jesus tossin’ them temple tables"

You'll be up for any challenge. Many storms are on the way better sharpen your faith. Count the cost, take up your cross. And wear it every day. Rest in Me and I will give you strength.

what's goin' down,"Welcome to the world of a kid named Mikey. Who had only one reason to be hated by whitey. Raised on a farm outside of South Bend. Where they hated on him cause he was African American. But three years later, Mikey was the town pride. Basketball Mikey went and got himself a bull ride. Earned his acceptance on the hardwood floor. And that's something white America could never ignore. Stop, hey, what's that sound. Everybody look what's goin' down. Stop, hey, what's that sound. Everybody look what's goin' down. What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down. You wanna know just what's goin' down. What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down. You wanna know just what's goin' down. Take a look around. Everything is comin' down. Do you hear the subtle sounds. Of our mortality slippin'. People on the go. We'll be reapin' what we sow. Yeah we say we want to know. But I got my suspicions. Welcome to the world of a girl name Susie. Susie's only crime was that she was born a cutie. Physically abused by her uncle and his friends. Alcohol let 'em all leve the house with grins. But Susie couldn't shake off the memories. Forced to find her own kind of remedy. A man-eater for the rest of her days. Three kids, three men, no daddies by eleventh grade. CHORUS. What is goin' diggy down x2. When you find what you lost. But you lose what you found x2."
wonderin' (feat. matthew thiessen),"Well I’m wonderin’ ‘bout the road ahead of me. Wonderin’ ‘bout the things you said to me. Wonderin’ if these dreams will ever do. And I’m wonderin’ ‘bout the way I spend my days. Wonderin’ if it’s even worth the chase. Wonderin’ if they’re stealin’ me from you. Uh! We didn’t know what to do. But you were lookin’ at me, and I was lookin’ at you. And we were thinkin’ it odd, but we were thankin’ our God. For the hope that He put down deep in our hearts. And yo, without a second to think. We was tourin’ around, and we were making that bank. And we was ridin’ in style, clockin’ them miles. With the songs that He put down deep in our hearts. Yeah, it’s been a minute, my friend. And you and I, we never thought it would end. But when we stop to pause, it opens the doors. On some dreams that were put down deep in my heart. But hey, I’m always thinkin’ of you. And I can see your influence in the things that I do. Thick and thin, forever my friend. ‘Cause there’s a bond that was put down deep in our hearts. And hey, if I could turn back time. I wouldn’t touch a day, I wouldn’t shade the shine. ‘Cause I do know this, I won’t be remiss. With the memories locked away in my heart. Wonderin’ if we ever had a clue"
wonderin' why,"Wonderin' Why. I’ve played in L.A. and D.C., Manhattan and Sydney. And Kingston, Jamaica where my Mandy was made. It’s 98 degrees in the straight-up shade. I say I’m stickin’ with her for the rest of my given days. “Somebody told me that you’re takin’ a break. A sabbatical from rhymin’ on the records that you make. A little birdie said that wasn’t the case. They blamed your exodus on “DC” partners Kevin and Tait”. “Hold up, I didn’t say all that”. I wanna move the people on a hot summer’s day. I wanna serve up the Truth like it’s pink lemonade. CHORUS. So if you’re wonderin’ why I. Continue to try my. Skills at this rap game. Girl, I can’t get enough. I been rockin’ the black folks. And tellin’ those white jokes. And people are people. So just throw your hands up. If you’re wonderin’ why I. Continue to try my. Skills at this rap game. Girl, I can’t get enough. I been rockin’ the church folks. And tellin’ those same jokes. So all of God’s people. Won’t ya throw your hands up. I’ve been away for some down time. But thought it was ‘bout time. To give my freaky people what they came here for. I guess I needed some head space. And felt that by God’s grace. My homosapiens would still be up for some more. I’m talkin’ God in my hip-hop. If not, then my show stops. And everyone around me knows I ain’t gonna sell –out. To those bad guys, they pushin’ them white lies. Tweak the word freak and you’ll be airing tonight guys. CHORUS. I wanna move the people on a hot summer’s day. I wanna serve up the Truth like it’s pink lemonade. I wanna give my people what they can’t deny. I wanna light up the skies like the Fourth of July"
yours,"Every time I turn my back I get the feeling that. I'm 'bout to take a shot to the skully with a bat. I'm out of control, need you to fill my soul up. And could you shed a little light on the skeletons holed up. My past is taking me to task. And I can't guarantee how much longer I'll last. Without You I'm a hopeless wreck. So I cry out Your name as I drop to the deck. Don't get me started, don't even get me started. Don't get me started, don't even get me started. I'm Yours. Take me as I am. I'm Yours. So take this space between us and fill it up again. I'm Yours. Take me as I am. I'm Yours. So take this space between us and fill it up again. Simple minded little punk. Thought I was the junk. Nobody ever told me that my doo-doo stunk. What was I out of my mind. Or was I just trippin' on an ego. But You filled up the space and You never let me go. Bullseye to the center of my soul. One shot but it rocked like a fatal blow. This love was Your gun, mercy Your shells. Now I'm a dead man walkin' down a skinny trail. I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops. Give it all I got. Shout it from the rooftops. So you can take your best shot. I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops. Give it all I got. Shout it from the rooftops. Like it or not. I'm a dead man walkin'. I'm a dead man walkin' down the boulevard"
