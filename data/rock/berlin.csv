take my breath away,Watching every motion. In my foolish lover's game. On this endless ocean. Finally lovers know no shame. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn around and say. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching I keep waiting. Still anticipating love. Never hesitating. To become the fated ones. Turning and returning. To some secret place to hide. Watching in slow motion. As you turn to me and say. My love. Take my breath away. Through the hourglass I saw you. In time you slipped away. When the mirror crashed I called you. And turned to hear you say. If only for today. I am unafraid. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching every motion. In this foolish lover's game. Haunted by the notion. Somewhere there's a love in flames. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn my way and say. Take my breath away. My love (repeat and fade)
no more words,"You're talking, it all sounds fair. You promise your love, how much you care. I'm still listening and still unsure. Your actions are lacking, nothing is clear. No more words.

I'm looking for a long romance. Not a picture of passion or one time chance. No more words. You're telling me you love me while you're looking away. No more words.

Don't promise we can work it out. You can leave right now if you're feeling doubt. No more words. You're telling me you love me and looking away. No more words. No more words and no more promises of love"

go ask the lonely,There's a pain in my head. And a hole in my bed. Where you used to lay. Yesterday. There's a cat on our roof. And he howls at the moon. No one hears his plea. Sounds a lot like me. How does it feel to wake up. Alone every night. With no one to hold you. And tell you everything's alright. Go ask the lonely. How it feels to cry. Go ask the lonely how it hurts inside. Go ask the lonely how it feels to be free. Don't ask me. Got some time on my hands. Got these chains off my feet. Oh does it mean. My life's complete. There's a song in my heart. And I keep going on. But that doesn't mean it's easy to be strong. Whatever happened to all our hopes and dreams. Whatever happened to you and me. You and me. Go ask the lonely. How it feels to cry. Go ask the lonely how it hurts inside. Go ask the lonely how it feels to be free. Don't ask me

I slept in your arms, content to go on dreaming. A nightmare too real to imagine. Losing you. Paralyzed tonight, tearing me apart. You wake to the sound of another day. Smile at me. And I hate that I want you. But nobody ever made me feel. Feel the way I do now"

Throw off your mask. Freedom at last. Trust in a needed friend

"sex me, talk me","Back against the darkest wall. Knowing that it dare not fall. The mannequin is real. The hair across his empty eye. Says careful mystery is mine. Hide and seek if you desire. I started with hello. By chance are you alone. Silence turned my eyes onto my feet. Sorry to disturb. Losing all my nerve. As I walked away he grabbed my arm. Turned me around and said. Try this. Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me. Whirling dervish careless whirl. Dancing wildly for the girls. Challenged by the sudden change. Attention for a baby's cry. Turning eyes to he and I. A smile says the jokes on me. We sat down again. His eyes took me in. Was I having a good time. I said hey Mr. Man. I don't understand. A finger on my lips says stop. A hint is left but never dropped. Try this. Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me. Driving home in silent car. I wonder just how much how far. At my place the engine ran. ""Would you like to come inside?"". He flashed that smile. ""No thanks maybe another time"". And as he pulled away he cried,. ""Try this"". Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me. Sex me, talk me"

She wasn't history.. She's just a number. One day she gets her final pay. And she goes far away. Green trees call to me. I am free but life is so cheap. Scenery is still outside of me. All alone, trapped by its beauty. Shayla turned to run away. To leave in peace and end her stay. Years of fear were in her way. Lost in space and down she came. Suddenly some subtle entity. Some cosmic energy brushed her like shadows. Down here we stop to wonder. Cars on the freeway.. Bright lights and thunder. Trapped in the Shayla funk - Excorism.

take my breath away,Watching every motion. In my foolish lover's game. On this endless ocean. Finally lovers know no shame. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn around and say. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching I keep waiting. Still anticipating love. Never hesitating. To become the fated ones. Turning and returning. To some secret place to hide. Watching in slow motion. As you turn to me and say. My love. Take my breath away. Through the hourglass I saw you. In time you slipped away. When the mirror crashed I called you. And turned to hear you say. If only for today. I am unafraid. Take my breath away. Take my breath away. Watching every motion. In this foolish lover's game. Haunted by the notion. Somewhere there's a love in flames. Turning and returning. To some secret place inside. Watching in slow motion. As you turn my way and say. Take my breath away. My love (repeat and fade)

the metro,"I'm alone sitting with my empty glass. My four walls follow me through my past. I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain. And you were waiting there swimming through apologies. I remember searching for the perfect words. I was hoping you might change your mind. I remember a soldier sleeping next to me. Riding on the metro. You wore white smiling as you took my hand. So removed we spoke of wintertime in France. Minutes passed with shallow words. Years have passed and still the hurt. I can see you now smiling as you pulled away. I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand. ""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes. I remember a night we walked along the Seine. Riding on the metro. I remember a feeling coming over me. The soldier turned, then looked away. I remember hating you for loving me. Riding on the metro. I'm alone sitting with my broken glass. My four walls follow me through my past. I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain. And you were waiting there swimming through apologies - sorry. I remember searching for the perfect words. I was hoping you might change your mind. I remember a soldier sleeping next to me. Riding on the metro"
the world is waiting,"She never sleeps, never laughs, never feels the sun. And when you ask her how she is. Tired and broken. She works alone, eats alone, drinks alone at night. She has a family far away. And she doesn't know them. And every day goes by like a silent dream. Behind the same four walls closing off her screams. Captured, inside a trance. And once upon a time she had hopes of her own. But as the tears go by she sinks like a stone. Is there someone somewhere who cares. One day she woke up to a life. Without anyone to hold at night. She looked up to the sky. The world is waiting. Take what you want. Release yourself from the past. The world is waiting. Step through the door. Finding a way at last oh-oh. He never cries, never talks of the youth he's lost. And when you ask him what he needs. It's just dignity. Cause every day he's pulled like a man on a string. 9 to 9 he's working down on his knees. To feed the children he never sees. One day he turned out the light. Without anyone to hold at night. Then he opened up his eyes. The world is waiting. Take what you want. Release yourself from the past. The world is waiting. Step through the door. Finding a way at last oh-oh. Don't look back. There's just one track. The weight on your shoulders. Is only in your mind. The future's here. Leave the rest behind..."

If I appear to make demands. It's only 'cause I want you back

With a kiss I'm falling apart. When I look in your eyes. There is nothing I can do. With a touch I am yours. With a kiss you're breaking my heart. In a moment I'm lost. Now I succumb to you. All of my senses. All of my senses. All of my senses. In a different world I've known you for a thousand years. Now you're back in my life again. Forever we'll be here"
with the lights on,With the lights on. With the right song maybe. You could get a little lucky tonight. With the lights on. Til the sun's up baby. Let me see you let me bring you to life. In the spotlight. When the mood's right baby. And you're looking me deep in the eyes. With the lights on. Take it all off baby. And I want to see you do it tonight. I love your skin. I love your bones. And when you move. You move for me alone. I love your hands to take control. Make me feel like I can fall. I want your skin. I want your soul. And when you move. You move for me alone. I love your hands to take control. Make me feel like I can fall in love. With the lights on. Going down there baby now. I'm wanting to kneel at your feet. With the lights on. True religion taking me. I want to see your everything. I like it when you're topless. I'm a hot mess baby. When you do the slow reveal I like. With the lights on. Take it all off baby. Cause I know you'll show me something I like. I love your skin. I love your bones. And when you move. You move for me alone. I love your hands to take control. Make me feel like I can fall. I want your skin. I want your soul. And when you move. You move for me alone. I love your hands to take control. Make me feel like I can fall in love
world of smiles,"I'm thinking. faces changing pictures come to mind. try to change the subject. sensation. stare reveal me, still i want to know. capture time in a photograph. well i say ""how do you do"". shatters my mirrored view. if only your lie would disappear. why don't you plaster your face. then i just might believe. i'll crack you open, smash you down. i repeat. your mad charade. this s. r. game you play's a freeze. indifference. greetings and smiles. you've got yours now i've got... mine. i've got to swallow your pride. shallow men hear no rhyme. furniture shifts as you walk by. why don't you look in my eyes. what do you see in there. plastic melts in a world of smiles. i'm laughing. hurt me, hurt me, now the joke's on you. satisfy your conscience. stop talking, stop talking. tear me open and leave me here to bleed. cut me up, cut me down to size"
x-girl,I'm a big fat new perversion. In the closet of your mind. I'm the swelling in your darkroom. When the fantasy unwinds. I'm the stormy in your weather. I'm the living in the lines. I'm the way you hold together. And the way you lose your mind. XGirl XGirl. Next world for XGirl. Like a butterfly; boy to man. XGirl XGirl. Next world oh yeah. Your next stop: Wonderland. I'm the voice that tells you Do It. When youâre paralyzed with fear. I'm the devil and the angels. I'm the silence that you hear. I'm the reason that youâre crying. In your season of content. XGirl XGirl. Next world for XGirl. Like a butterfly; boy to man. XGirl XGirl. Next world oh yeah. Your next stop: Wonderland Wonderland Wonderland. I'm the hunter and the hunted. And the voyeur on your side. CHORUS: XGirl XGirl. Next world for XGirl. Like a butterfly; boy to man. XGirl XGirl. Next world oh yeah. Your next stop: Wonderland
you don't know,"We cross the street. You hold my hand, afraid to let me go. And if I walked away and left you there. Would you know why?. You are the answer now, you don't know. You can be everything, you don't know. You won't believe it now, you don't know anymore. You are the reason and the rhyme. We walk into your room. A mirror caught your reflection. You look away, you call to me. To fill in the frame. You are the only one, you don't know. You are the fire of love, you don't know. You can't believe it now, you don't know anymore. You are the reason and the rhyme. I walk this road and you follow me. I don't know why. You are the answer now, you don't know. You can be everything, you don't know. You won't believe it now, you don't know anymore. You are the only one, you don't know. You are the fire of love, you don't know. You can't believe it now, you don't know anymore. You are the reason and the rhyme. You are your reason and your rhyme"
you home tonight,"There's a place you go after dark. Where you send your haunted heart. In the shadows you look for the friend. Who'll take you where the sidewalk ends. It's a sad affair. You reach out but there's no one there. Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight. Take your hand and hold you tight. Who'll be the one to say you're right. And promise you paradise. Who's gonna take you home tonight. You couldn't see that love was the price. What happened to the light in your eyes. Broken dreams fall at your feet. Stand alone on a dead end street. Who's gonna hear your prayer. Look around, there's no one there. Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight. Take your hand and hold you tight. Who'll be the one to say you're right. And promise you paradise. Who's gonna take you home tonight. Turn the darkness into light. And wipe the tears you try to hide. Just another stranger will be taking you home tonight. She'll tell you dreams come true. Stoke the fire out of you. But when the morning dawns. Another angel has gone. You say it's in your blood. One love just isn't enough"
