deteriorate,"Time has had it's way with me.. My broken tired hands can`t build a. Thing.. The wires that have held me still. Embedded now in flesh to find my will.. The idle of my days is won,. The empty I have fed has made me numb,. Despite what you will find in me.. The failures of my past just swirl beneath.. I need a heart that carries on through the pain. When the walls start collapsing again. Give me a soul that never ceases to follow,. Despite the infection within. Our careless feet leaving trails. Neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.. Our careless feet leaving trails. Neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.. This is where I find my fall. The cares that held me alive don`t work at all.. And every step away from here is closer to the plague. I hold so dear.. I need a heart that carries on through the pain,. When the walls start collapsing again. Give me a soul that never ceases to follow. Despite the infection within. Our careless feet leaving trails. Neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.. Our careless feet leaving trails. Neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.. Awaiting my end. Breathing in the day that finds me new.. Redemption begins bleeding out the flaws. In place of you.. Awaiting my end.

undying,"Ever since the day that I was made I’ve been deciding the end. And I was made of wood and stone that won’t diminish or bend. So when the heavy hand of death is here to take me away. I’ll be the solid grip of time, forever holding my stay. Nobody ever made a force that took a beating like me. I call the earth and every scum to come and try to fight me. Cus when I made the choice to live beyond the dirt that we tread. I felt the curse of mortal limit fall before it was said. (Pre-chorus:). When this season ends.... (Chorus:). One final heart-break. And blinding lights will guide our way. Free us our blind state. They will call us by our name. Undying. Tearing through these days I find the tolerance to strive and push on. I know what lies beyond this life for me is already won. No one can take away the blood that covers over my fall. Without the blood of perfect life I know I’m nothing at all. So now I reign forever hallowed in eternity’s hand. No man can shake me from the everlasting ground that I stand. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). We are the ones who will still remain when all is laid to waste. We are the ones who, when angels cry, will see them face to face. We are the ones. (Chorus)"
what is left,"I saw you through my window. I let you crawl inside. Your face became my shadow. Your voice became my guide. What is left?. I take what I can get, and black out all the rest. What is left?. Some words that I forget, and more I regret. I came here alone. I thought you'd gone. I left you in bones at the end of the road. I came here alone. The long way home. I left you in bones at the end of the road. I'm trying to evade you. I'm dying to be done. One solemn night I'll take you down the barrel of my gun. What is left?. I take what I can get, and black out all the rest. What is left?. Some words that I forget, and more I regret. I came here alone. I thought you'd gone. I left you in bones at the end of the road. I came here alone. The long way home. I left you in bones at the end of the road. [x3]"
one thousand apologies,"There you stood in disbelief,. trying all you could to see through these lies. And every word that I could brethe,. would find you more inclined to leave, but I tried. And knowing what I've done to you,. with every thought you suffer through. My heart as black as evil can. And everything I could have been,. erased by what I wanted then. I couldn't think a lesser man. (Pre-chorus:). All the delicate ways. That I deepened our graves. My apology pales. (Chorus:). Oh, the pain in your eyes. My regrets have never known such sorrow. Oh, the shame that you hide. Resolutions are the same tomorrow. So now I reap what I have sewn, and any rapture I had shown has bled dry. And I walked the streets alone, accepting the pain I'd never known, as you died. Then I hurt myself to see it too, to feel the knife put in you. My heart as broken as my ways. I never should've let it pass, this fall was never meant to last. The reason's gone and damage stays. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). (Pre-chorus). (Chorus)"
resistance,"Conviction was your shelter. Boarded up, rejected, left behind. To lower life where aimless spirits die. Suffer your indifference. Tie that troubled stone around your neck. Exalt your fall and hear your mother's cry. Colder now. Thank your hopeful solitude it's colder now. Throw your blackened heart into. Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. (your time will not outlive your debt to pay). Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. Defiance on this day. This plague is not your savior. Turn the barrel's eyes upon this strife. The truth, it will reveal that fading line. Colder now. Thank your hopeful solitude it's colder now. Throw your blackened heart into. Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. (your time will not outlive your debt to pay). Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. Defiance on this day. There is a kingdom beyond your eyes. Whole of redemption, defining will. The path of self is wrought with fatal lies. Send them back to hell. Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. (your time will not outlive your debt to pay). Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. Defiance on this day. Send them back to hell"
the science of lies,"Bow down- before the god of cash. The philosophy of modern man is leaking fast. No foundation for the fram by which you set your mind. Just a legacy for the feeble to find. Desperation breeding faith unto a pitiful lie. ""Give us your money and we'll open up your gullible eyes"". No redemption, not a reason, but a symbol of why. This digression of surrender is the science of lies. (Chorus:). Believe the sacred blasphemy. They feed. That hollow voice inside your head. Recieve the fleeting fallacy. They breathe. Trace every step from where you were led. Look back and tell yourself what they said. (Now flee). And now you feel it pulling you down. How can you buy into a faith that hasn't permanent ground?. Give me blood-soacked, sacrificial worth. Not the artificial product of a fraudulent birth. Give me selfless, consecrated reprise. Not a worthless contribution to the science of lies. (Chorus). Feel it pulling down. (Chorus)"

Resurrect again to say.. I made my promise, and now i've fallen.. Through broken pieces i set you.. I will stand and fight to justify you.. You have bled and died to justify me.. Let me see it all die in front of myself so i can't lie.. A hollow design for the new side.. Exterior death for the old side.. This is the end of the last time.. Bury the old and say the name.. break the mold and new remain.. Resurrect again to say.. I made my promise, and now i've fallen.. through broken pieces i see you..

You know I'm trying to believe that you're never gonna leave. It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face. There's nothing left! The fear is gone!. When my heartstrings come undone. I will wait for you, pray for you. Before I make my final run. I will stay with you, decay with you. I know I'm not the perfect one, This pain has just begun. It's something I already chase, I already chase. You bring me to a better path, It's everything I asked. It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face. There's nothing left! The fear is gone!. There's nothing left! The fear is gone!. And when my heartstrings come undone. I will wait for you, pray for you. Before I make my final run. I will stay with you, decay with you.

a broken upper hand,"Trapped behind my state of mind, I took your words and now I'm blind.. And everything you've given just kills me.. Your words swarm me through my soul like locusts.. Eating away at any glimpse of focus.. Their eyes flaming red like pain.. Filling the void once righteous and bloodstained.. But words can't kill the light inside me that tears me from the hate that binds me.. I feel it crawling up my spine.. But i'll cut it off before it reaches the bloodline.. You'll never fade me out, you'll never turn me off.. You'll never reach the end, you'll never hear enough.. You're half-grasp can't exterminate my stand.. You can't rule with a broken upper hand.. A fragment of what's been left behind.. Trapped behind my state of mind, I took your words and now I'm blind.. And everything you've given just kills me.. Your face brings out the hate that rots me.. The face of everyday that haunts me.. I can't pull away my blank stare.. A thousand times should prove I don't care.. But hands can't steal the light that makes me.. Or bring me to the fate that breaks me I feel it crawling up my spine.. But i'll cut it off before it reaches the bloodline.. You'll never fade me out, you'll never turn me off.. You'll never reach the end, you'll never hear enough.. You're the half-grasp can't exterminate my stand.. You can't rule with a broken upper hand.. A fragment of what's been left behind.. Trapped behind my state of mind, I took your words and now I'm blind.. And everything you've given just kills me.."
a thread of light,"These words are a weapon for the ones in pain. A fair fight for the children of a lesser name. We are the war against the sick and fatal fall of man. A hollow tip to the notion of a Godless stand. Quick to slam the gavel on a true solution. You let the fear become a stranglehold. Tear it all apart so you can render your own belief. You never listened to what you were told. Condemned. You built a wall, disbelief is all you left us. Reaction. Without a thought, your resolve is to reject us. [Chorus:]. You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light. And all you wanted was perfection. You found your darkness stands on a thread of pinhole light. So all you are is contradiction. You buried the chance in a self-righteous glance. So your sons and your daughters were safe. But your imperfect path is a heart made of glass. And the world is a charming grenade. Condemned. You built a wall, disbelief is all you left us. Reaction. Without a thought, your resolve is to reject us. [Chorus]"
anihilate the corrupt,"Behind the eyes of my compassion lies a suffering soul. And in my blood a bitter darkness slowly taking it's toll. I feel the death of our connection and the fading of light. Between the shards of sudden panic from choking on my life. I see the scars of your addiction and the feeling you hide. A blackened heart from all the hatred you will never rewind. Within the depths of your depression hear you pleading for help. Your just a shell of vacant ruin, a portrait of myself.. I can't breathe alone. You can guide me home.. CHORUS:. I am the face of your affliction.. Feeding new life through the cracks in your skull.. Beneath the skin of your aggression is a thickening fear. A swelling plague from every devastating voice that you hear. You feel the throes of contradiction in the world that you left. Another day in your delusion, the never-ending death.. I can't breathe alone. You can guide me home. I can feel you here. You can draw me near. CHORUS:. I am the face of your afflication.. Feeding new life through the cracks in your skull.. I am the pain of your conviction. Stabbing you right through the back of your soul.. This is life, this is love. (CHORUS). I can feel you here. You can draw me near."
artificial light,Tell me your misery. Give us the antidote. I heard the voice of change. Behind a vacant note. All this tearing apart. Without a reform. Call it what you will. I'm not afraid to say. I've heard it all. Connection lost. We're standing by. Artificial light. You sell a fix. For our defect. And all we find. Artificial light. Doesn't break the model. I can't feel it in my bones. Nothing shattering my world. No. We want a real cure. Not idle sympahty. The dark consuming light. That you have failed to be. No. It's not enough. I resent this deprivation. Your remedy. Is not a weapon. To slaughter the sorrow. It's just to keep you from feeling alone. I've heard it all. Connection lost. We're standing by. Artificial light. You sell a fix. For our defect. And all we find. Artificial light. Doesn't break the model. I can't feel it in my bones. Nothing shattering my world. No. I'll never see. What they see in you. Doesn't break the model. I can't feel it in my bones. Nothing shattering my world. No

beauty through the eyes of a predator,"I'm not the only one who can't see why it crossed your mind. I see your life and death reduce into a product line. It's not enough to see you speaking through the blindest of eyes. The same dead, cold breath is reducing mine. I can't see why. You're not a saint, you're a thief. You can't deny. It's all a ploy underneath.. All I've seen (you better learn to keep your face under the dark). All I need (wake up and feel the blood escape your heart). Your disease (for every word that you devalue and mistake). I can't breathe (for every soul you nauseate with what you say). CHORUS:. You've brought this verdict on yourself (before we ever had a chance). I hope you cry for the one's you've lost.. You built this burden when you fell (you know we never took a glance). I hope it's worth all the blood it cost.. It's been a long way back from the dissipated path. Only half way through, say goodbye and take a breath. And when the end shines new with the burn of nothing left. I'll give you one last chance to say you're done and give it back.. I won't agree.. Your remedy is a joke.. I can't believe.. That you can breathe and not choke.. (CHORUS). Peddle your faith to the blind.. And cheapen the love that you feel so painful.. Pushing the guilt through yourself.. And suffer the mold of a prime example.. (CHORUS). I feel my lungs beginning to burn.. With every foolish word that you spit, another nail you'll get."
beheaded,In the never-ending circle where. The powerless meet. There grows a struggle from the burden. Of sustaining defeat. In the face of every coward lies the. Blindest of hate. And in the eyes a sharpened image of. The damage they made. You look at me to bear the burden of the suffering past. It wasn't me behind the veil. Of a heartless mask. And where were you the day that everybody. Cursed your name?. You were the distant voice of pride. That never stood the shame.. The weak of the mind will use fist. And the fist of the frail will bring gun. The loudest of guns provoke bombs. And in wrath he will chase until it's done.. CHORUS:. Your history is dead.. Dead wrong.. Dead - dead wrong.. Philosophy is dead.. Dead wrong.. Dead - dead wrong.. Within the mind of modern culture. There's an idle cog. It is the section of humanity that never forgot. And in the midst of moving forward we have given the right. To let the wolves attack the sheep and bury guilt inside. I won't forget the twisted picture of the filth that we were. Or disregard the fading voices of the people we hurt. But I was never pulling triggers or degrading your face.. Don't look at me to give the reason for the pain that you trace.. (CHORUS). The scars outlive the pain.. Reflections will remain.. The scars outlive the pain.. Your sickness will remain.. Dead - dead wrong.
beyond me,"Where does your allegiance lie?. In failing hearts and idle hands. What corrupted eyes. To heed the certainty of man. You fail me. I never was my final word. I could never be. The only voice I heard. Trust in the powerless. The ever knowing inside. See no deliverance. Leave all conviction behind. The darkest of hearts they cease to bleed. (And) never deny for the self to lead. You'll find in this a lonely home. No tear consoled. To wander on a nameless road. Beyond me. Compromise all time unseen. For this, your momentary lust. Pride deafening. Unsung hymns gather rust. No corruption, delusion, enslavement here. Driven not by fear. Not converted to. I see an aimless soul. In the ruthless cold. Fighting off the call. Dying to be whole. I see an aimless soul. In the ruthless cold. Fighting off the call. Giving in to the fall. You'll find in this a lonely home. No tear consoled. To wander on a nameless road. Beyond me"
blood in the tears,"Don't come on quietly when you draw near. Don't go on lightly. Don't leave me here. I wither quickly in winter's cold, but carry onward like I was told. And I wait for a sign. Like blood in the tears of all my enemies (So they will see). Knowing the pain the way they should. Blood in the tears of all my enemies (Given to me). Leaving a trail to where you stood. And when it's quite, when you can hear, I beg you take me away from here. Cleansing red, wake the dead"
carry me down,"And if you see me losing ground. Don’t be afraid to lie. I know the pain inside my heart can’t break the fear inside of yours. And if you see me losing faith. In what it means to die. Don’t let me leave before I know what lies behind the stained glass doors. Save sorrow for the souls in doubt. Bleed every care out. [Chorus:]. Will you carry me down the aisle that final day. With your tears and cold hands shaking from the weight. When you lower me down beneath that sky of gray. Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain. For every word we never spoke. We have a tear to cry. For every silence like a wall between a better you and I. So if you see me losing sight. Of all the death in life. You’ll find the peace in every time I failed to see the death in mine. Let all the fear inside you drown. Tear out the blade and lay it down. Save sorrow for the souls in doubt. Bleed every care out.

coffin builder,"My fall draws near.. My life fell out of my hands and into. This hole where everything's cold. I lose the feeling of guilt. There's. nothing inside, my innocence died.. And now the emptiness grows, it's. bringing me down and taking my crown. I've seen where everything's dark.. It's here in my soul, I'm losing control.. CHORUS:. Have mercy on me.. Have mercy on me.. Have mercy on me for every thorn I've driven in.. Within these walls you'll see. Alone in here - the end.. Before my very last day I'm making it stop.. I'm turning it off.. I'll fight the feeling I have until everything's. Gone. Resistance has won. Now time is healing these wounds and. You are still here releasing my fear. My life fell out of my hands. They. took it away, I'm taking it back.. (CHORUS). And everyday I feel like this weight's. Constantly dragging me down. Broken for the last time (Never get the best of me, won't get the best of me). I've got a heart of steel, but your words are. Constantly bringing me down.. I'm open for the first time (Never get the best of me, wont' get the best of me). (CHORUS). My fall drawns near."
cold winter sun,"In the dim light of a sacred heart. See the vacant all descending to a left-hand path. Where the dead reign in the godless dark. Every martyr flying blind into the hands of wrath. We give way to sorrow. When the self is all we build. And wake up tomorrow. In the blood of who we killed. We are the kingdom come. We are come undone. And our shadows bleed to one. By a cold winter sun. Give a weak mind all the coldest steel. Our beloved at the mercy of a heartless horde. Tear the cause out, let the cowards reel. Bring the demon to the teeth and lacerate the cord. We give way to sorrow. When the self is all we build. And wake up tomorrow. In the blood of who we killed. We are the kingdom come. We are come undone. And our shadows bleed to one. By a cold winter sun. In the blood of who we killed. We are the kingdom come. We are come undone. And our shadows bleed to one. By a cold winter sun. We are the kingdom come. We are come undone. And our shadows bleed to one. By a cold winter, cold winter sun"
collapsing,I see the weight of hollow death residing in you. Take now your final breath. Exhale the truth. I see the fear of nothing left. Dead fragments of youth. You hold it in yourself. I feel it too. I mourn your blindness. I die along. And swallow darkness. In misery is where I belong. Collapsing in on yourself. I don't know why I try. Collapsing in on yourself. I don't know why you deny. I know the light is burning dim and dying in you. I know the pain that lies within. I feel it too. No vow of silence. No remission of truth
cross to bear,"Hail victim, raise your voice. And curse this mortal chain. Lay down your tired albatross. Let Heaven hear your strain. This unrelenting plague unbound. Your agonizing toll. Like God himself in parallel. Delusion takes you hold. Recoil. I see you writhe in distress. Hell on earth. No one ever stood for pain like this. Sing to me your plight unjust. Define it for the rest of us. No river of your tears, no sympathy will find you here. Not one of you bastards has a cross to bear. You clench your fist unto the sky. To sound your troubled mind. Unto the throne of sorrow? s scribe. Of sacrifice divine. Bite your tongue. Bleed unsung"

Something inside.... I was the blood inside your broken heart. I was the stone that you had held. What have I become?. What have I become?. Thoughts like shadows swelling through my mind. What have I become?. Something else inside.... Is driving nails into my soul. Angels from my door. Driving nails into my soul. Something inside.... Is driving nails into my soul. Angels from my door. Driving nails into my soul. Something inside.... I close my eyes. Search for you. Retracing every step. Is driving nails into my soul. Angels from my door. Driving nails into my soul.

everything was white,"As I clear my mind enough to see. Decaying pieces of my being that have fallen on me. I find the one clean cut that has given the wrath. Beneath the deep and cleansing fire that is shaping the path. I've had all my life to fall in place. I watch all my past in right decay. And with every step that shames my face. I see all my pieces catch ablaze. CHORUS:. The pain is fading, now you're leaving me alone.. I can't stop bleeding, I'm depleting on my own. I can't bury every form I've seen. The hollow pieces of perfection are embedded in me. And with every step the walls give way. And in the shadow of deceit I can see you fade. I've seen all those dreams we try to hide. And the sound of honesty's reply. But I'm not that man you've seen inside. He was born so pure but then he died. (CHORUS). With every word I breathe out. I feel it escaping from my soul. With every thought created. Omission leaving me so cold. I've seen inside the downward fall. Remember all the filth I saw. I've seen inside the downward fall. Remember everything I saw. (CHORUS)"
fading away,"Demon Hunter - Fading Away. It’s in this wake that i find myself. Losing the will to resume this hell. When every breath is a dying wish. It’s harder to follow the point of this. This broken place that i call my home. Has deepened the sorrow that i have sown. And i can’t erase what is in my heart. I want it to finish before it starts. My own solution insufficient again. No false illusion, this devouring threat. I break the vessel, giving air to its red. And open my fate to the darkened sky. . I’ve been fading away. I’ve been waiting on the call to reach my veins. Ready or not. No attention to waste. Every sorrow of the soul will read my name. When i cease to exist. So now i’ve come to the final sleep. I pray that forgiveness is mine to keep. I know it’s hard to forget this man. Driving the failure into your hands. My own solution insufficient again. No false illusion, this devouring threat. I break the vessel, giving air to its red. And open my fate to the darkened sky"
feel as though you could,"Rebellion… Oh cheap thrills and vacant youth. Carry out your own will.. Shovel deep and bury truth. Social stain, punk wreck, mother’s own defect.. Sing that song you know so well – sing it one foot in hell.. Eyes wide black – turn your back.. Oh how the foolish will see…how every man he does bleed.. The vultures circle, halo of the dead.. Another vicious cycle, swallow what you’re fed.. And now the vultures circle, halo of the dead.. Another vicious cycle, be true to your dissent…. Somehow…feel, feel as though you could..

fiction kingdom,"Dig yourself a shallow grave. Your life is not the legacy of honor you would dig six feet for. Broken is the way you came. And broken is the way that you will leave when everything is paid for. Make another hollow claim. A fable of regurgitated nothing we could tear wide open. False in every possible way. Your god is still the powerless creation you will lose your hope in. Now you bleed for the lord of hate that you stole from the pages of truth. And separate the product from its own account, to birth a gospel of inferior view. Black reign is all in dream. Your truth is absolution’s end. [Chorus:]. Dead is the way you stake your life on. The oblivious belief. What a waste to sell your spirit for. Lay upon the bed you made. Your word is not the legacy of truth that you would bet your life on. Stand to face a mirrored blade. And tremble in the wake of your conviction as you put your life on. Now you bleed for the lord of hate that you stole from the pages of truth. And separate the product from its own account, to birth a gospel of inferior view. Black reign is all in dream. Your truth is absolution’s end. [Chorus]. This war is a page unwritten, but we know how it ends. Take a step to the throne, convicted. Choking back your amends. Cry the death of fiction kingdom. Your truth is absolution’s end. [Chorus]"
fire to my soul,"We flow with bitter words that file sharp our teeth. And we bite off our own tounges. We trample any trace of your divinity's hope. And we'll sacrifice our young. With our eyes sewn shut now the light can't shine. Oh, we'll never wake from dead. And when you beg for us to open up and let you in. Then we'll cut you out instead. (Pre-chorus:). You promised you'd give us your word. We never believed it was true. And we pretend that we never heard. Cus we still don't believe in you. (Chorus:). I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul. Is this the voice we die for?. We die for life. We built a wall to keep you out. Ignoring every word. And we saw your face behind our tounges. Apathetic to what we'd heard. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). Why does it falter? We built it all ourselves. Why does it hurt so bad, forsaking all this help?. Why are we choking on pills designed to heal?. We threw our hearts away cuz we're too afraid to feel. (Chorus)"
follow the wolves,"Run. Every second is a pure affliction. But I can feel your pain. Choke back the burn of wrath as they violate your name. No sign of innocence in this godforsaken place. When the truth is in your hands, they’ll spit upon your face. Dismantle the ground they stand on. Give power a name. You’ve traveled the path of slander. Now bury the shame. Shed rejection. Learn to follow the wolves. [Chorus:]. Run away to the blackened sky, through the fear of disbelief. Run away from the hollow cries, to the shelter of release. Run away to the blackened sky, through the fear of disbelief. Run away from the hollow cries, to immunity. See the struggle of the faithless lot as they negate their time. How low to sink to the depths of their frame of mind. Dismantle the ground they stand on. Give power a name. You’ve traveled the path of slander. Now bury the shame. Shed rejection. Learn to follow the wolves. [Chorus]. No tear for desolation. Nearing the end of our misery. [Chorus]"
gasoline,"I thought about you. I thought about the ones that I forget. Oh please forgive me. I hope that I've not pushed you to the edge. Let me wash away the painful words I wrote. We can smother out the flames within my soul. No more standing by the way that I believe. We can smother out the flames. With gasoline. You break around me. You say that I should give my heart a rest. We? ll watch these flames. Like a tower of dissent, choking out regret. Devouring light. An image of my soul, out of our control"
god forsaken,"So my descent was a shallow defense. I made to lay waste through the powers of fame?. When all the blame I carried around my neck. Viscous cycle of hate that I changed to find my way!. When the sovereign comes to me. I eclipse in the shadow's veil. Killing all I cease to be. For the passing vein is hate!. I fall to the fires of hell, never fail to awaken. Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again. I'm god-forsaken.. I fall to the fires of hell, never fail to awaken. Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again. I'm god-forsaken. With every turn I fail to learn my path. And it's wearing down my days. To be the voice of a half-dead suffering age. I never want to read that I ceased to find my way. When the sovereign comes to me. I eclipse in the shadow's veil. Killing all I cease to be. For the passing vein is hate!. I fall to the fires of hell, never fail to awaken. Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again. I'm god-forsaken. I fall to the fires of hell, never fail to awaken. Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again. I'm god-forsaken. Now the grayness of our souls!. I fall to the fires of hell, never fail to awaken. Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again. I'm god-forsaken. I fall to the fires of hell, never fail to awaken. Though my soul descends in the darkness of my heart, again. I'm god-forsaken"
grand finale,"You’ll find me face down, hands bound, ready for the blade to make me two. If judgment falls to meet this ground, that fate will run me through. No day of wrath will see me break for that faithless breath of shame. When the heretics come to make that list, be true to speak my name. Leave all you see. The curse of man is dead, the hourglass turned on its head. And every care will fade away. To wake a new day. [Chorus:]. Take every throe within us all. The very breath inside our soul. We bleed the life into your hold. The very death of our control. No man can bring a fatal sting and I laugh at the gallows thrall. Just line it tight around my neck so my words will break that fall. Fall. Leave all you see. The curse of man is dead, the hourglass turned on its head. And every care will fade away. To wake a new day. [Chorus]. That final day will fall. And those who curse the sky will face the earth. The many turn to one. The God of Gods’ own righteous son. Begging for that second birth. [Chorus]"
hell don't need me,I don? t wanna close my eyes. I can? t tell if I? m asleep or if I? m blind. We? re going nowhere. No one seems to care. I could sell a peace of mind.

We? re going nowhere. No one seems to care. [Chorus]. The water will decide. Where to feed me. Mother don? t you cry. Hell don? t need me. Don? t need me [x4]. [Chorus x2]. The water will decide.

helpless hope,"Now the soil takes your breath. Nothing left. Just bones and empty roads. And a want for something more. Open door. But careful not to ask. And holding fast. Now sorrow burns around you. Anger, fear and death surround you. So afraid. Helpless. Where is the void you're after?. Emptiness, the final chapter. So afraid. Helpless hope. To the hollow hands of fate. No escape. No panic, no reprieve. And the faith it was too blind. Too unkind. But faithful in the wholeness of. The hole itself. Let go. Follow"

i am you,"A black heart in an empty shell where the desperation laid waste - I am you. A blank page in an unknown book and the opposition you face. I am the endless scar, the broken hope, the gaping hole in your faith - I am you. The dark trail of endless graves where all the lifeless lay. I am waiting for that blade to fall and cut me free of this. Hollow life that leads to all the ends that don’t exist. [Chorus:]. Time to burn this design, to free ourselves. We will burn this together. Time to fuse this design, to make us one. We will burn this together. A new voice for the broken souls in a world awaiting its death - I am you. An everlasting well of life for the hopeless and the wrecked. I am the dying self, the narrow path, the calm that conquered the storm - I am you. The crosshairs on the head of shame, the negation to conform. I am waiting for that blade to fall and cut me free of this. Hollow life that leads to all the ends that don’t exist. [Chorus]. I will rise. I will break this. You will rise. You will break this. We will rise. We will take them down. Rise and break them down. Down, down, down. Break them down. [Chorus]"
i have seen where it grows,"A shell for the earth, all seasons reverse.. A life inside out in a jet-black hearse.. The feel of pain and the taste of dirt.. A dardened sky and the loss of worth.. Lower me down under glorious green.. Eternity waits on a broken machine.. Exit the soul in a vibrant white.. Leaving the shell in the dead of night.. Life is a path, Death a destination.. I've met the end of being, my eyes are open wide.. I feel myself depleting, and watch my body die.. A step to the throne, i stand alone.. A vacant mind and a destined home.. Engaging the end in a seamless gaze.. Like blind i climb through the tortured blaze.. Raise me up into white unstained eternity gained, only life remains.. Forever the scars have been washed away. Like blood on the brow of a forgotten day.. Life is a path, Death a destination.. Ive met the end of being, my eyes are open wide.. I feel myself depleting, and watch my body die.. Life is a path, Death a destination."
i play dead,"Play dead again. It just might stop before the end.. If I pretend you may not see the pain I'm in.. So close to me, can't tell what I'm supposed to be.. Don't stop to breathe, can't bear to think what you might see.. This tourniquet, these blessed hands around my head. So I can keep from.... Bleeding.. I've got to find a way to stop before it starts.. Finding its way through my veins right to my heart.. I never thought it something everyone could see.. And it kills within me.. CHORUS:. I won't, I won't leave without a trace.. I won't be erased.. It's in my head, I can't forget what you once said.. The words I read, the fractured soul that I can't mend.. Right here with me, killing the void I used to be.. Remembering through fading sparks of memory.. Two broken hands lift seven wounds and fight to stand. To keep the lungs from... Caving.. I've got to find a way to stop before it starts.. Finding its way through my veins right to my heart.. I never thought it something everyone could see.. And it kills within me.. (CHORUS). Turning. It's moving. Escaping right through me.. I care not. I bleed not. For you I believe not.. I play dead."
i will fail you,"These quiet words, they carry me away. Returning, they keep coming back. In idle thoughts and hollow cut-away. Disarm me, no will to attack. Though the sorrow and fear. They may depart you today. I will fail you, Of that Im sure. I will remind you of the pain forevermore. And when my sins are just a memory. Faith restored. I will fail you to the core. Lost in the shadow of an endless grace. Relentless, my reign is unbound. In this abandon I will devastate. Dismember till agonys found. Though the sorrow and fear. They may depart you today. I will fail you, Of that Im sure. I will remind you of the pain forevermore. And when my sins are just a memory. Faith restored. I will fail you to the core. I know they prey upon me. I feel them just beyond my door. I will fail you, Of that Im sure. I will remind you of the pain forevermore. And when my sins are just a memory. Faith restored. I will fail you to the core. I will fail you, Of that Im sure. I will remind you of the pain forevermore. And when my sins are just a memory. Faith restored. I will fail you to the core"
in time,"When the calling comes for the rest of us. Let me help you decide. But there is not much sympathy left to give. For the deserted mind. I have the same fear tearing the plot in two. I know it's not your fight? Right?. But the weight of it is breaking upon my back. So I can see that it's not without my life. Am I the last one?. Are we a dying breed?. Anyone outside?. I fear tomorrow will eclipse today. In time. We will erase it all. In time. We are the fault of our own fall. So if you see it all, you take it to the ends. And let it sound throughout your bones. In this trust they will not relent their rope. But the faithful are not alone. Don't let them tear it from your hands"
incision,"Don’t leave us. They said that you had gone astray. Don’t lead us. Away from the light. We stood behind the veil and watched you walk away from us. You shattered all our dreams in one fatal mistake. You fractured every piece of life that we cared about, remember how. You breathed in us new life and then you took it away, you’ll never live that down. I gave you every guiding word to cut it off, cut it off, cut it off, cut it off. Now you hand me back the blade to make that first incision for you. [Chorus:]. Wait and see. The weight of life may be the end of me; the tension, break me. We held you up on high so why did you abandon us?. We never thought you’d be the one to fall so far. You fractured every piece of life that we cared about, remember how. You breathed in us new life and then you took it away, you’ll never live that down. I gave you every guiding word to cut it off, cut it off, cut it off, cut it off. Now you hand me back the blade to make that first incision for you. For you. [Chorus]"

From all you said, im still paralized.. But i'm almost out of breathe from saying things that i'll regret.. My time is over, i cant do this alone.. I'm infected with you, pull the plug already.. Tell me before i go, that your infected with me.. I cant remember if i ever took a minute to say.. That if it had to be now, i'm glad it had to be me.. I cant recuperate, i'm never going to leave here alive.. Just help me throu this, dont let me die here.. But i'm almost out of breath from saying things i'll regret.. My time is over, i cant do this alone,. i'm infected with you, pull the plug already.. Tell me before i go, that your infected with me.. I'm killing time just trying to find the words that fall so short of you.. I'm loosing sleep, i cant compete, i'm giving up, i cant do this alone.."
jesus wept,"Give me the call and the power to be. Show me the will to lead and see me reign. Take me to a higher pain. Sever the burden and tell me to run. Open the gates of mercy when I come. Give me every want in vain. Or give me none. Give me. Eyes wide. See red. I'm why. Bloodshed. Eyes wide. So I don't forget. I'm why. I'm why Jesus wept. Show me the weight of a fury divine. Bury the dark inside, let waste the flood. Drown us in holy blood. We are the shallow, the scoffers of Hell. Shatter the path of self into the black. Take me to the end of hope. And bring me back. Give me. Eyes wide. See red. I'm why. Bloodshed. Eyes wide. So I don't forget. I'm why. Eyes wide. See red. I'm why. Bloodshed. Eyes wide. So I don't forget. I'm why. I'm why Jesus wept. Eyes wide.

Our tired hearts are failing now, from the inside out. Lead us home. One more time. This day I kill the witness. Take back what’s mine. And give disgrace a name. Give myself to compromise.

I’ve come to sever all. [Chorus]. Blessed hands will tear me off. And break me at the wrist. Drag me back to solid ground. And slay the fate I kiss. [Chorus]"
less than nothing,I suffocate.. Reality is tearing my life away.. All in vain.. I'm taking my pride into the grave.. What a fine line we walk with our eyes closed.. Giving our worst as first like we don't know.. Burning my way through life with a vengeance. Giving my weight in hate until the neck bends. Tearing out every trace of emotion. Falling into this cell that you've opened. Hollow as all these faces around me. Feeling your fatal infection surround me.. CHORUS:. We all live in fear of something.. We all disappear like nothing.. We all live in fear of something.. We all equal less than nothing.. I suffocate.. I'm taking my life from first to last.. All this hate is dragging my face through broken glass.. How can we be so blind in the same light?. Covering all these scars that we can't hide.. Feeling my way through thorns of rejection.. Bleeding out all this filth of infection.. (CHORUS). Nothing.. Nothing.. We're nothing.. Nothing.

my destiny,"I cast my heart unto the beast. Unto my sin. I would never find my faith in this belief unseen again. The solitude of youth. My conscience wearing thin. I will suffer my infliction as a desecrated man. But the fear, the blood, the sweat and sound. They brought me here to wait for the will to appear. We were blinded by the sacred light. They carried us away. Like a razor through the dark that night. My destiny. Now the weight of living word. Come calling true. And my heart will drink the blood of death my soul forever knew. On the reverence of a voice. My clarity of you. The king of whom I never was has run my spirit through. We will carry that flame. The fire is in our name. We will carry that flame"

my throat is an open grave,"We lay face down in pale solitude. To save face, we pulled our walls in front of you. To the same place where we danced in front of you. We fell from grace and watched the hope fall from your face. This isn't me I used to say. All the love was so gone. It feels good to be alive. I've been dead for so long. And all those broken promises. I can't face, afraid if someone notices, i lose my place. Fractures, broken, paralyzed. I need some space, tear me open, analyze. This isn't me I used to say. All the love was so gone. It feels good to be alive. I've been dead for so long. Wake up screaming, I'm awake and dreaming. And I won't stop breathing until my heart stops beating. This isn't me I used to say. All the love was so gone. It feels good to be alive. I've been dead for so long."
no reason to exist,"Lost. When the storm hits, you will leave this. Awake. Time will pass through, and break you. Broken, or so you say. Nobody bought that fable anyway. So calloused, and so naïve. To wear a heart of fiction on your sleeve. Bury every sign of life in filth and hollow trend. And push against progression on the path of logic’s end. Like tears flowing upward. [Chorus:]. Lost, an aimless soul. When the storm hits, you will leave this. Awake to wasted days. Time will pass through, and break you. This wreckage you’ll never be. If you were raised in Hell you’d own the sea. Don’t tell me it’s not your choice. You sold a blessed future for some noise. Bury every sign of life in filth and hollow trend. And push against progression on the path of logic’s end. Like tears flowing upward. [Chorus]. With every waking second you front, another real life loses ground. Ten thousand arms outstretched and you have the nerve to strike them all. No reason to coexist?. No reason to exist"

You wear the make and wave the banner. they made with sin. Revealing every single lie. that you've been breeding within. Wash over the skin you've broken. Think over the tone you spoke in. (Pre-chorus:). So lost in your affliction / addiction. The solemn comfort of your grave. If you close your eyes. the light can't take it away. (Chorus:). Not I - I won't conform to what I see in you. Not I - I won't surrender what I am. Not I - And even if it was a part of me. Not I - I'll never be that way again. The blind will follow on the path. that you created in vain. No guiding light, but just the shadow. of the dead will remain. Dig open the pain you're hiding. Give your hand to the faith you're fighting. The void you suffer is a curse. forever bleeding inside. Now you embrace the fatal sickness. you should despise. Remember the day you lost that. Where is the shame that will. bring your soul back. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). Reach back behind your pride. And pull the thorn from your burning pain in your. side. Sing me a new song. A broken song of redemption and regret. Sing me a new song. And beg for all the mercy you can get. (Chorus)"
not ready to die,"You've got a lot of nerve and I've got a lot of fingers to point. While you were busy building knowledge I was already right. I know a voice like yours is not a weapon at all. And even mine is not a chisel for a thickened skull. So you can chant your anthems to the deaf. And we can sit here and cry until there's nothing left or. (bridge). we can take our voices with our hands. Make like knives and make demands. We'll take our voices - with our hands. Make like knives - we'll make demands. I'm burning bridges for the last time. I'm breaking habits for the first time. I saw my future today, it said I'm going away. But I still haven't sung the last line. On my way down.... (chorus). I'm not ready to lay, not ready to fade. I'm not ready to die(2x). And everyday of my life I can feel it getting harder to breathe. With every minute ticking by I'm getting ready to leave. I know a life like mine is not a reason to fret. But I've been busy making scars that you will never forget. If only thirty three years can save my life. I've had twenty three more to make things right. So when I'm taken to the sky and you're still here. You can clear your mind and dry your tears. When I'm taken home - and you're still here. Just clear your mind - dry your tears. (bridge). We'll take our voices - with our hands. Make like knives - we'll make demands. I'm burning bridges for the last time. I'm breaking habits for the first time. I saw my future today, it said I'm going away. But I still haven't sung the last line.. On my way down... (chorus). I'm not ready to lie, not ready to fade. I'm not ready to die. When I'm taken home - and you're still here. Just clear your mind - dry your tears. We'll take our voices - with our hands. Make like knives - we'll make demands. (chorus). I'm not ready to lie, not ready to fade. I'm not ready to die"
one last song,"There is a fire in me. I feel its burn within my flesh. Returning back. With every vacancy of breath. No compromise. There is no blade to bring me down. Bleeding at the seams. I ever fight the final round. All of the sorrow, all of the pain. Hold me down. This is the battle within my name. Forever. One last song to sing. One final decree. One last song. This everlasting word inside me. There is a final day. To every tear, every breath. Falling enemies. No burn of anguish in us left. All will be undone. When every lost will be found. On this day I cease. To ever fight the final round. Forever give me this day. For every soul they take away. Forever give me this day. For every lie to wash away"
one thousand apologies,"There you stood in disbelief,. trying all you could to see through these lies. And every word that I could brethe,. would find you more inclined to leave, but I tried. And knowing what I've done to you,. with every thought you suffer through. My heart as black as evil can. And everything I could have been,. erased by what I wanted then. I couldn't think a lesser man. (Pre-chorus:). All the delicate ways. That I deepened our graves. My apology pales. (Chorus:). Oh, the pain in your eyes. My regrets have never known such sorrow. Oh, the shame that you hide. Resolutions are the same tomorrow. So now I reap what I have sewn, and any rapture I had shown has bled dry. And I walked the streets alone, accepting the pain I'd never known, as you died. Then I hurt myself to see it too, to feel the knife put in you. My heart as broken as my ways. I never should've let it pass, this fall was never meant to last. The reason's gone and damage stays. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). (Pre-chorus). (Chorus)"
our faces fall apart,"Where is the inception of digression in a human life?. When is the answer just a bright light?. Who am I in shamelessly defining all the wrong and right?. What is the difference if we all die?. I am not the first, the last, the absolute. You will find no clarity in me. I am the deceased, the least, the solitude. Failing every face I try to be.. I'm not your progress, the pay of your pains. I'm stabbing the questions for answers I can't face. I'm losing the battle and finding no life to retrace.. I built this anguish with my own hands. I felt the burn inside with my heart.. I built this anguish with my own hands. I watched our faces fall apart.. CHORUS:. I felt the tears of all your angels, so cold.. I saw the fall of all your children, I'm so cold.. We are just a fraction of the poison living in this place. How can we answer with a straight face?. Who are you in gauging every standard you. Would have us chase?. Are we alone to run the last race?. We are all the weak, the meek, the innocent. Kissing every fault that we disgrace. We are of the worst, the cursed, the desolate. Leaving every hope that we embrace.. (CHORUS). You turn your eyes to me in hope of my decline. Pointing your blame as I faltered on that line. We saw your slander when you pulled it off the shelf. If you want justice you'll point it at yourself. Face your fears. Trace your tears.. Kill the blind assumption that you know how I react inside. I am not so hollow, you can't see what grows inside my mind. Straight-faced, straight-faced."
relentless intolerance,"These eyes they will gaze and reflect. And gauge every thought I reject. No sway of stance in changing times. Just a narrow mind commanding respect. We stand on the words of the wise. And languish every call to despise. We know the hollow wound of their lies. (Pre-chorus:). No reformed edition. Never losing vision. Now into forever. Only getting better. Ways of now, spiral down. How much more we allow. (Chorus:). Keeping sight of the vow we made. Holding fast to the hope. So when we stand in the line of wrath. The true and righteous will know. The foundation that we used to uphold. Now regarded as the madness of old. Every alteration made to the standard of truth. Is a nail in the coffin we hold. We embody everything they despise. Because they see us through degenerate eyes. So when thay cast you down as intolerant filth. Stand firm, never bow to the lies. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). See the scorn inside my eyes. (Chorus)"
resistance,"Conviction was your shelter. Boarded up, rejected, left behind. To lower life where aimless spirits die. Suffer your indifference. Tie that troubled stone around your neck. Exalt your fall and hear your mother's cry. Colder now. Thank your hopeful solitude it's colder now. Throw your blackened heart into. Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. (your time will not outlive your debt to pay). Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. Defiance on this day. This plague is not your savior. Turn the barrel's eyes upon this strife. The truth, it will reveal that fading line. Colder now. Thank your hopeful solitude it's colder now. Throw your blackened heart into. Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. (your time will not outlive your debt to pay). Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. Defiance on this day. There is a kingdom beyond your eyes. Whole of redemption, defining will. The path of self is wrought with fatal lies. Send them back to hell. Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. (your time will not outlive your debt to pay). Resistance. (you had reason in your hands and you walked away). Resistance. Defiance on this day. Send them back to hell"
ribcage,"All hail the newborn sin. Reject the boundaries and soak the cancer in. Hope kills the filth you crave. So bleed the truth out and fall into that grave. Uphold the brand new skin. Accept the failure, refuse to rise above. Break through the ribcage. And tear the heart out from everyone that you love. (Pre-chorus:). Over and over again. We'll bury the shame underneath the lies we breathe. Over and over again. We'll carry the blame for the hell that we can't leave. (Chorus:). Show me - the path that leads into your mind. Release - The thoughts you lock so deep inside. Show me - I'm the one who knew this pain. Release - Before you fall into this again. Behold the loyal slave. His rotting shell now a tomb where death can play. See nopw his pride caves in. Alone he fights to stop this dark decay. Feed, feed the lust you need. And fainter grows each plea from skies above. Break through the ribcage. And tear the heart out from everyone that you love. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). Building a life out of all that you hate. We see through the front that you tried to create. The world that you had hoped for was only a fake. And just like the maggots that made you this way. I know"
screams of the undead,"Every single time i feel the burn i try to throw it away.. A fast fix for the brokenness of everyday.. Its like the pain is building up, it's swelling up,. i've got to choke it down and break it down until it's broke down.. it's like a shard of glass, it's like a broken piece.. Of everything i hate, it's everything in me,. A burnt heart stains black the blood it flows.. A dead soul will overshadow.. Push it out. I'ts everything you never were,. Push it out. I want to see it shatter.. And Everyday i see my life rewind tearing through dreams i find im wide awake.. And even when it's wrong i start to learn, and then i do it again.. I reach out to grasp and get a broken hand,. And everyone is going to turn their backs.. I want to take them down,. and strike them down and leave them struck down.. Its like im made to fail with everything i gain.. Just an infected piece in a defective game.. My two hands give birth to nothing right.. A black past is an effective foresight.. Push it out, it's everything you never were.. Push it out, i want to see it shatter.. And Everyday i see my life rewind tearing through dreams i find im wide awake.. And everything is building up, a pale heart is an empty cup,. if nothing ever changes, im breaking down, giving up.. Burn it out, let it go, break it all, lose control,. force it out, bring it through, pass it down, make it new.. Kill the pain, scrape it off, leave it here, make it stop.. Tear it down, bleed it out, all the hate, see it straight.. No one ever told me that it would all stay the same.. Everyday i fall on shards of my hatred and shame.."
shallow water,"Remember the threat from which it was said. You will reap every seed that you sow. And the tomb where you lay is the bed that you made. Be still in the pain that you wrote.

sixteen,"Sixteen, Oh holy day. Your time has come and passed. The rapture we’ve been waiting for. Has come to us at last. Sixteen for every fake. Sixteen to every whore. Wipe that dirt from off your face. Sixteen is at your door. Oh, voiceless, wasted. You soaked your heart in gasoline. Now light it up and burn. [Chorus:]. The same cycle ever-turning you is calling. It’s calling. The scene is begging for a grave tonight. It always, it always will. You take the name of love divine. And drag it through your blood. Now turn to face what you have made. And mourn what you have done. Oh, voiceless, wasted. You soaked your heart in gasoline. Now light it up and burn. Voiceless, wasted. I came this far to drag you down. And watch you take your turn. [Chorus]. Farewell to false pretension. Farewell to hollow words. Farewell to fake affection. Farewell, tomorrow burns. [Chorus]"
"snap your fingers, snap your neck","Nothing breeds more contempt for this world. Than memories now formed. Every moment a new seed. Is grown to no reason, the trouble unfolds. For the trials of today. I'm no jury, really don't care how you feel. The pleasant notion of miraculous change. Drifts into multiple jeers. (Chorus:). You want the good life. You break your back. You snap your fingers, you snap your neck. Seconds drip through my hands. Washed of moments unborn. All the spaces between bleed. A tribute to the sacrament never exposed. A message to the forces,. I've no pity, don't know how thankful to feel. Expectations of my daily bread. Gives me the hunger to steal. (Chorus:). You want the good life. You break your back. You snap your fingers, you snap your neck"
someone to hate,"A figure for the closing of time, the antagonist divine. Void of vacant word, one final answer to be heard. I will carry my decree into a storm of lead. This is total war, my want for tolerance is dead. To my last breath. I am someone to hate. I will spit upon the idol for which you stand. I will carry the weight. I will bury your deception with a wrathful hand. Heart is cold, and my weapons are washed in blood. I avow to the call on high. My resolve in the blessed above, in this ever-consuming divide. A figure for the closing of time, the antithesis defined. Threat to faith untrue, I am the enemy of new. All you advocates of hell, you corruptors of free will. The culling is nigh, better get your fill. I am the cry for the falling of time. Born into the lust within our eyes. Taught to write the scriptures for our lives. We inherit the lies. To my last breath, to my final day"
storm the gates of hell,"Broken teeth, a shattered jaw. Ten to one, behold my god. Wicked sons of heaven’s loss. Raise your own inverted cross. Kings of earth, iron first. Serve the sacred you dismissed. Stand before your final day. Choke on every line you pray. Raise your glass to death. Not one second left. Chorus:. Wake the lifeless, die to fight this. Stand beside me, storm the gates of hell. Wake the lifeless, die to fight this. Stand beside me, storm the gates of hell. Storm the gates of hell. Coward’s heart, a serpent’s tongue. Stand to face what you’ve outrun. Fear of death, fear of pain. Bound to all you took in vain. No more lies, no regrets. Sever ties and hollow debt. Open eyes, live to learn. Or watch your blessed temple burn. Raise your glass to death. Not one second left. (chorus). Hell hath no fury at all"
summer of darkness,"I'll be the one last breath before this death. I'll be the final glimpse of truth when there's none left. And if I shame your face, degrade your faith. I'll be the first to hide behind disgrace.. Blood loss on account of my failing aim.. Treason - at the root of my shameful name.. I found my way to fall.. I never meant to break your heart.. CHORUS:. Breathing in this pain (rejecting all I am). I hear you cry again (Is this my final stand?)"
the awakening,"Fall into the flood of your awakening. Drown. You're a trace of what I used to be. Waging the battle for the appreciation you'll never win. Behold the army that will harken with open souls. A tiny voice of pester softer than a drop of a pin. And so naive thinking you were. The source you told. I was composing the beginning before you had begun. Where did you sharpen such a tongue. For the sound you spill. I want the honor for the favor that I've already won. Without the ignorant deduction. That you reveal. Give me the pain of something real. No empty notion, I want to see the pressure rising. Give in a way that I can feel. When you disagree with me I want to see your eyes burn. Fall into the flood of your awakening. Drown. You're a trace of what I used to be. You wrote the words you couldn't. Stomach manifesting with breath. I read the thoughts you never. Questions would show me your face. If confrontation were to wake and. Rear it's ugly head. I get the feeling you'd be wanting it all erased. This simple gossip is your only definition of life. And what a vacant purpose taking it to your grave. There is no threat of loss in. Hearing the slant you cry. Oh what a fool to think you fell. On the mass you crave. Fall into the flood of your awakening. Drown. You're a trace of what I used to be. Awaken from the delusion of validity. Awaken into the truth of how it used to be. Wake up. Fall into the flood of your awakening. Drown. You're a trace of what I used to be. Awaken"

It's so beautiful to me, it's everything i see.. It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that i need.. And i can't taste anything less.. Every time i'm forced down.. To be with yourself, take all the blood you want.. But not from here.. It's so beautiful to me, it is everything i see.. It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that i need.. Not a hand, not a finger.. This is my home.. I'm dying here.. I hide in the corner.. That look on your face, I'm accustomed to it.."
the heart of a graveyard,"Everything in time. Set your eyes upon the shallow surface. Hollow out your mind. How divine, you disengage yourself. Tell me. Tell me of your consolation. Tell me. I am lost in the gray. Tell me that your final home is not a. A shot in the dark. Tell me that your hopes and dreams don' t end in the heart. Of a graveyard. Set aside your soul. Let tomorrow realize itself. Tell me. Tell me of your consolation. Tell me. I am lost in the gray. Tell me that your final home is not a. A shot in the dark. Tell me that your hopes and dreams don' t end in the heart. Of a graveyard. Tell me that your final home is not a. A shot in the dark. Tell me that your hopes and dreams don' t end in the heart. Of a graveyard. Brace for the ending. You may not see. Will you stop descending. Six shallow feet. Tell me. Tell me of your consolation. Tell me. I am lost in the gray. Tell me that your final home is not a. A shot in the dark. Tell me that your hopes and dreams don' t end in the heart. Of a graveyard. Tell me that your final home is not a. A shot in the dark. Tell me that your hopes and dreams don' t end in the heart"
the last one alive,Did anyone survive?. I swear I heard your voice beyond this side. Does anyone still try?. Does anyone still hope to set their eyes. Beyond this place?. Where angels fall and darkness reigns. Where time dissolves the brightest flame. Ever the same. Whether I'm the last one alive. Or ascend before my time. Better I'm the last one alive. Than a soul denied. So this is how we break. And this is where we find the only hope. Within this place. Where angels fall and darkness reigns. Where time dissolves the brightest flame. Ever the same. Whether I'm the last one alive. Or ascend before my time. Better I'm the last one alive. Than a soul denied. Whether I'm the last one alive. Or ascend before my time. Better I'm the last one alive. Than a soul denied. Whether I'm the last one alive. Or ascend before my time. Better I'm the last one alive. Than a soul denied
the latest and the last,"Words of high cost (you spit a curse at my name). When thoughts of hate cross (I can't devour your blame). This is your choice (this is your hammer to crush). I have no voice (you're not the hand that I trust). Throw it down on me.. Throw it down on me.. CHORUS:. Before you break your silence, before we tear this open.... We'll count the dead and hopeless for every word unspoken.. Thoughts, like blood, run (forever staining our hands). Mouth like cold gun (before the barrel we stand). The latest and the last (you put a price on my head). The latest and the last (the worst is already said). (CHORUS). Spilling through your teeth. You're sick of what you've seen. You point your guilt at every step we took in loyalty. (CHORUS). Throw it down on me.. Throw it down."
the science of lies,"Bow down- before the god of cash. The philosophy of modern man is leaking fast. No foundation for the fram by which you set your mind. Just a legacy for the feeble to find. Desperation breeding faith unto a pitiful lie. ""Give us your money and we'll open up your gullible eyes"". No redemption, not a reason, but a symbol of why. This digression of surrender is the science of lies. (Chorus:). Believe the sacred blasphemy. They feed. That hollow voice inside your head. Recieve the fleeting fallacy. They breathe. Trace every step from where you were led. Look back and tell yourself what they said. (Now flee). And now you feel it pulling you down. How can you buy into a faith that hasn't permanent ground?. Give me blood-soacked, sacrificial worth. Not the artificial product of a fraudulent birth. Give me selfless, consecrated reprise. Not a worthless contribution to the science of lies. (Chorus). Feel it pulling down. (Chorus)"
the soldier's song,"Through the clouds of fallen ash,. a lonely mother's cry. Among the fields of broken glass. the loyal few will arise. Faith now regained. Finding strength within the void,. a raging fire ignites. A spark of ever-burning power. and conviction to fight. Pride be your name. They will spit upon the honor. that you guard with your life. And run to hide in selfish fear. when threat of death is in sight. Lay down your shame. Armed with resistance and blind to the cost. They say your purpose is mindless and lost. But we don't adhere to the slander they spill. We mourn with your losses and stand, stand by your. will. [chorus]. These tears we spill. They haunt us still. The cries of the weak lie quiet in sleep. Beneath our feet. [x2]. We are the sons of Holy Wrath,. a shining light in the dark. The ones who walk amongst despair,. no sign of fear in our hearts. Stand in death's way. Shut out the voice of mindlessness,. open your eyes to the truth. Believe the words that stand the test. and not the slurs of the youth. You're not what they say. [chorus]. Turn over the tables and watch them run. You'll be the weapon they can't outgun. [chorus]"
the tide began to rise,"I don't belong here. I never saw this on the path I walk. The blood-stained walls, the lines of chalk on the floor. It's getting so hard. I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise. I can't remember. The way it was when everything felt right. My mouth held shut and my eyes sealed tight with control. (Pre-chorus:). So I remember on the inside. (Chorus:). I found a dark, infernal place I don't want to face anymore. Somehow, I won't stop feeding the pain. My heart's just the same as before. So now I'm stuck here. Between the guilty and the insincere. The words I spoke have left me here all alone. I should have known this. I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise. I wish it all gone. I could've burned it when I had the choice. And now I'd die to kill this noise in my head. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). So I remember on the inside. If this is all the love my spirit can give. Just take it back tonight. There is not a reason more to live"

Like every hope that rose and dissolved into hurt. Dying to care. I'm searching for some solace in this air. . But the wind, it cuts to my bone. The wind, this hollow breath of cold. The wind, it cuts to my bone. The wind, in winter's arms I feel at home. And I won't let go. But I will take you with me. Right to the end. But the wind, it cuts to my bone. The wind, this hollow breath of cold. The wind, it cuts to my bone. The wind, this hollow breath of cold. The wind, it cuts to my bone. The wind, in winter's arms I feel at home. I feel at home"
the world is a thorn,"The gavel has fallen, along with the rest.. Are we expected to settle for this?. Bring us the plague, lead us away.. Blacken tomorrow with ash of today..

Won't trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust.. Won't love a world where my God is mocked.. I defy.. Oh, a kiss on the serpent's head.. We walk in the line of deceit, the walking dead.. Can't you feel the ground of our discretion giving way?. Refusal of hope, solution demise.. Bury the truth in a mountain of lies.. Won't bow to man.. Won't bow to government.. Won't trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust.. Won't love a world where my God is mocked.. I defy.. This is what you try to sell me.. Subjective nothingness.. Pull your sickness from my throat.. Let me breathe the truth.. Let me breathe the truth.. Won't bow to man.. Won't bow to government.. Won't bow to greed.. Won't bow to false hope.. Won't bow to self.. Won't bow to modern code.. Won't sell my soul to a dead world. I defy."
the wrath of god,"Tear at the voice inside. Dig a deeper tomb and all the self can finally resonate, resonate, resonate, resonate. Tread on the path of pride.

Breathe deep. And as the fear before you falls. I know the pain is so unsettling. Breathe deep. So now you've built a thousand walls. But in the end it's all unraveling. Stand with a worthless sign. Wave it in the path of every face you cannot tolerate, tolerate, tolerate, tolerate. Breathe redemption into wasted life. Closer, closer. Find the wrath of God inside your eyes. Closer, closer.

this i know,"Let my soul be a silent storm. Conceived in the fire of war. I am the ruthless bane of a wicked world and I pray on the killing floor. When I carve my name across this place.

this is the line,"Fire surround, in cleansing repose. Letting the filth, like venom it flows. Scar, the mark, remind us the pain. Breaking the bones that will reach out again.

You’ll find it in the veil of night where solitude is born. In the emptiness of broken flesh, at the mercy of the thorns. You’ll find it in the veil of night where solitude is born. In the emptiness of broken flesh, at the mercy of the thorns. Every line a path into an empty heart. Where the words of now forgotten love fall silent in the dark. Oh, The deliverance of blade and flame, your love. And greater is the blood. [Chorus]. Sister, don’t you sleep through your own eulogy. Don’t sever what you are for what you couldn’t be. [Chorus]"

I'm going to scream your name till you come back.. And every time I play with fire, I'm going to Burn, Burn, Burn until I learn.. And everytime I do it myself, I'm going to hate, hate, hate.. It's time to get it straight.. I bury sick side, I tear from the inside out,. I follow the downside, I'm waiting for something else.. I know that you'll be here and I'll be waiting.. I know that youll be near and I'll be waiting.. I turn it back and question everything in site.. It's like I try to fall again when everything is going right.. And everything that matters isn't everything in site.. It's taking every bit of me to keep this all inside.. I've never been the type to turn my back and run.. It's just never appealed to me to be the same as everyone.. And when it comes to shove, and I can't see you through the black,. I'm going to scream your name till you come back.. I bury sick side, I tear from the inside out,. I follow the downside, I'm waiting for something else.. I know that you'll be here and I'll be waiting.. I know that youll be near and I'll be waiting.. Lost my mind and I've lost track,. gonna scream your name till you come back.. Scream your name, lost my mind. I know that you'll be here and I'll be waiting.. I know that you'll be near and I'll be waiting.. (lost my mind), I'll be waiting.. I'll scream your name til you come back.."
tie this around your neck,"This is the age of the dead.. The generation of pagan and self-led.. You can feel the bones shatter beneath our feet.. The blood of lust staining our teeth.. We feed on pain (pain), disorder (disorder), delusion (delusion).. The filth of the modern plague.. And in this reign of Godlessness, the heathens will say. Tie this around your neck. Tie this around your neck.. Tie this around your neck. Tie this around your neck. Fool.. Save your breath my son. Just carry on home.. Time will prey on you and take you through Hell.. Ive heard every empty line.. Every curse, every word that you redefine.. I will turn my back on the coming storm.. Wont lie in the grave, I will be reborn.. They say. Tie this around your neck. Tie this around your neck.. Tie this around your neck. Tie this around your neck. Fool.. Save your breath my son, just carry on home.. Time will prey on you and take you through Hell.. Confusion reigns. Pride of the hopeless herd.. Blind to the will, blind to the word.. They will drown in the rule of man. Helpless and alone.. Save your breath my son, just carry on home.. Time will prey on you and take you through Hell.. They say. Tie this around your neck. Tie this around your neck. Fool.. Tie this around your neck. Tie this around your neck.. Fool... Fool... Fool."
tomorrow never comes,"Is there nothing I can say?. When you turn around and carry on this way. Have you lost the path we made?. When your fear had pulled you far away from grace. See you fading out again. All your promises are taken with the wind. And if tomorrow never comes. For all the cold and bitter ones, we can breathe. And if tomorrow never comes. For all the cold and bitter ones, let us sleep. Did they still your beating heart? (all the soul you gave). Did they take your words and tear them all apart?. Does it kill to let it go? (sacrifice your name). I hope if follows you and breaks your frail bones. See you fading out again. All your promises are taken with the wind. And if tomorrow never comes. For all the cold and bitter ones, we can breathe. And if tomorrow never comes. For all the cold and bitter ones, let us sleep. Here we are, one final time. To go and leave your soul behind. And if tomorrow never comes. For all the cold and bitter ones, we can breathe. And if tomorrow never comes. For all the cold and bitter ones, let us sleep"
trying times,These are trying times. Made to break the heart wide. But we still defy. We will make the dead rise. We can't be silent. We can't belong. We have a promise. To die upon. We'll set the fire. Into a song. To burn eternal. When we're all gone. These are trying times. Made to break the heart wide. But we still defy. We will make the dead rise
turn your back and run,"I'm growing partial to detesting a disease in me.. It's head swells into beautiful. Dependency.. With teeth that feed on flesh and everything.. I swear I am not.. A small price to bleed and give you everything that you want.. Dancing with the spirit, giving heart to pump a dirty vein.. Leaving with a scar, a uniform to bruise a perfect stain.. Anything you hate will be the root of everything you breathe.. Breathing in the dirt will leave you hating all that you conceive.. I try to push myself up, I'm breaking from the inside.. I'm slipping through the cracks and i try to push it out of mind.. Switch, you've got to turn your back and run.. To push it out is just a patch to heal a gaping wound.. A brass tack to pin a hair and heal a broken tomb.. I never thought i'd be the one to bring it down to this.. My last thought is through a statement and a shattered fist.. Face down, fearless, light me up, end this.. I try to push myself up, I'm breaking from the inside.. I'm slipping through the cracks and I try to push it out of mind.. Switch, you've got to turn your back and run.. Microns from the flame head.. Beat my hands to proceed nothing.. Staring into souls with blind eyes.. Taking the throne in my tiny hand.. And chase it with the pain.. You won't have life until you run.. You got to give it all away.. I try to push myself up, i'm breaking from the inside.. I'm slipping through the cracks and I try to push it out of mind.. Switch, you've got to turn your back and run.."
undying,"Ever since the day that I was made I’ve been deciding the end. And I was made of wood and stone that won’t diminish or bend. So when the heavy hand of death is here to take me away. I’ll be the solid grip of time, forever holding my stay. Nobody ever made a force that took a beating like me. I call the earth and every scum to come and try to fight me. Cus when I made the choice to live beyond the dirt that we tread. I felt the curse of mortal limit fall before it was said. (Pre-chorus:). When this season ends.... (Chorus:). One final heart-break. And blinding lights will guide our way. Free us our blind state. They will call us by our name. Undying. Tearing through these days I find the tolerance to strive and push on. I know what lies beyond this life for me is already won. No one can take away the blood that covers over my fall. Without the blood of perfect life I know I’m nothing at all. So now I reign forever hallowed in eternity’s hand. No man can shake me from the everlasting ground that I stand. (Pre-chorus). (Chorus). We are the ones who will still remain when all is laid to waste. We are the ones who, when angels cry, will see them face to face. We are the ones. (Chorus)"
wake,"Lay your fear on the line and wake up!. Now solitude of will has held you still against that wall. Device of former self you cannot help but to disown.. (wake up). Don't come crying for help when the fire surrounds you. When desperation calls you will not ply. Don't follow the mass into an endless grave!. You've heard that final main, now. (wake). Now lay your fear on the line and wake up!. My quest is, unholy tears. Throw your panic aside and let go!. They bring to light your fears.. The gravity of death is on your breath, it dwells inside.. Hold fast to your distraction feeding paralyze your time.. (wake up). Don't come crying for help when the fire surrounds you.. When desperation calls you will not ply. Don't follow the mass into an endless grave!. You've heard that final main, now. (wake). Now lay your fear on the line and wake up!. My quest is, unholy tears. Throw your panic aside and let go!. They bring to light your fears.. Hold your breath, between the silence. I won't buy your self-reliance!. So don't come crying for help when the fire surrounds you. When desperation calls you will not ply. Don't follow the mass into an endless grave!. You've heard that final main, now. (wake). Now lay your fear on the line and wake up!. My quest is, unholy tears. Throw your panic aside and let go. They will bring to light your fears now!"
wast me,"This is not for the undecided. For the other side. We made our bed in the lion? s den. No place to hide. Rejected, refused. We were born to lose. Or were we born for a higher call. Those scattered few. Sing. I made my vow and I swear. Take it to my grave. My grave. Will not regret to say. Before I fall away. Waste me. We are not for the fate of this world. Disillusioned, damned. May not maintain our foothold. But know where we stand. We were born for a higher call. Those scattered few. Sing. This is not for the undecided. For the other side"
we don't care,"This is the end of everything. A degenerate culture's elegy. Now the reaper is waiting at the door. Drunk on our blood and craving more. This is the sound of a thousand holy feet. Treading on a soon forgotten grave. This is a life-long declaration of war,. No sacrifice in vain. Let them remember the name. Feels like we've run out of air. They tear the breath out from our lungs. And we don't care. Feels like we've run out of air. Damnation passed down to our sons. And we don't care. Witness the end of apathy. We have embraced our suffering. Will the pain illuminate our fall?. Or will we see the blame at all?. This is the sound of a thousand holy feet. Treading on a soon forgotten grave. This is a life-long declaration of war,. No sacrifice in vain. Let them remember the name. Feels like we've run out of air. They tear the breath out from our lungs. And we don't care. Feels like we've run out of air. Damnation passed down to our sons. And we don't care. No compromise to end. We'll wash the blood off from our hands and fight again. Feels like we've run out of air. They tear the breath out from our lungs. And we don't care. Feels like we've run out of air. Damnation passed down to our sons. And we don't care. Remember the name"
what i'm not,"Time is wearing down my fight. My determination. Dividing in my head. This degeneration cull. It's my definiton. Recalling all I am. Where I begin. I could live my life for the void inside. To the vacant rise surrender mine. Forever divide. But I know. How the rest will go. And the line. That I live behind. Never hide. Never compromise. Like them. Everything I am. Is what I'm not. In my revelation. I can see it all clear. My enemy, my guide. Every idol I refuse. Every declaration. Becoming all I am. To my end"
what is left,"I saw you through my window. I let you crawl inside. Your face became my shadow. Your voice became my guide. What is left?. I take what I can get, and black out all the rest. What is left?. Some words that I forget, and more I regret. I came here alone. I thought you'd gone. I left you in bones at the end of the road. I came here alone. The long way home. I left you in bones at the end of the road. I'm trying to evade you. I'm dying to be done. One solemn night I'll take you down the barrel of my gun. What is left?. I take what I can get, and black out all the rest. What is left?. Some words that I forget, and more I regret. I came here alone. I thought you'd gone. I left you in bones at the end of the road. I came here alone. The long way home. I left you in bones at the end of the road. [x3]"
