kids,You were a child. Crawling on your knees toward it. Making momma so proud. But your voice is too loud. We like to watch you laughing. You pick the insects off plants. No time to think of consequences. (Chorus). Control yourself. Take only what you need from him. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Control yourself. Take only what you need from him. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. The water is warm. But it's sending me shivers. A baby is born. Crying out for attention. Memories fade. Like looking through a fogged mirror. Decisions too. Decisions are made and not bought. But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot. I guess not. Control yourself. Take only what you need from him. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Control yourself. Take only what you need from him. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Chorus x6
electric feel,All along the western front. People line up to receive. She got the power in her hands. To shock you like you won't believe. Saw her in the amazon. With the voltage running through her skin. Standing there with nothing on. She's gonna teach me how to swim. I said ooh girl. Shock me like an electric feel. Baby girl. Turn me on with your electric feel. I said ooh girl. Shock me like an electric feel. Baby girl. Turn me on with your electric feel. All along the eastern shore. Put your circuits in the sea. This is what the world is for. Making electricity. You can feel it in your mind. Oh you can do it all the time. Plug it in and change the world. You are my electric girl. I said ooh girl. Shock me like an electric feel. Baby girl. Turn me on with your electric feel. I said ooh girl. Shock me like an electric feel. Baby girl. Turn me on with your electric feel. Do what you feel now. Electric feel now. Do what you feel now. Electric feel now. Do what you feel now. Electric feel now. Do what you feel now. Electric feel now. Do what you feel now. Electric feel now
time to pretend,"I'm feelin rough I'm feelin raw I'm in the prime of my life.. Let's make some music. Make some money find some models for wives.. I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars.. You manage the island and the cocaine. and the elegant cars.. This is our decision to live fast and die young.. We've got the vision, now let's have some fun.. Yeah it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?. Get jobs in offices. and wake up for the morning commute?. Forget about our brothers and our friends.. We are fated to pretend.. I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals. and digging up worms.. I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world.. I'll miss my sister, miss my father,. miss my dog and my home.. Yeah I'll miss the boredom and the freedom. And the time spent alone.. But there is really nothing, nothing we can do.. Love must be forgotten.. life can always start up anew.. The models will have children, we'll get a divorce,. We'll find some more models, everything must run its course.. We'll choke on our vomit. and that will be the end.. We are fated to pretend.. Yeah yeah yeah"
when you die,"[verse 1]. I'm not that nice. I'm mean and I'm evil. Don't call me nice. I'm gonna eat your heart out. I've got some work to do. Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off. [verse 2]. Go fuck yourself. You heard me right. Don't call me nice again. Don't you have somewhere to be at seven thirty?. Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready. Ready to blow my brains out. [chorus 1]. You die. And words won't do anything. It's permanently night. And I won't feel anything. We'll all be laughing with you when you die. [chorus 2]. Words won't do anything. It's permanently night. And I won't feel anything. We'll all be laughing with you when you die. [verse 3]. Go fuck yourself. I'm mean, not nice. You said it twice. You said it twice. Don't you have somewhere to be at seven thirty?. [interlude]. I've got some work to do. I'm gonna eat your heart out. I heard you the first time"
little dark age,Breathing in the dark. Lying on its side. The ruins of the day. Painted with a scar. And the more I straighten out. The less it wants to try. The feelings start to rot. One wink at a time. Forgiving who you are. For what you stand to gain. Just know that if you hide. It doesn't go away. When you get out of bed. Don't end up stranded. Horrified with each stone. On the stage. My little dark age. Picking through the cards. Knowing what's nearby. The carvings on the face. Say they find it hard. And the engine's failed again. All limits of disguise. The humor's not the same. Coming from denial. I grieve in stereo. The stereo sounds strange. I know that if you hide. It doesn't go away. If you get out of bed. And find me standing all alone. Open-eyed. Burn the page. My little dark age. I grieve in stereo. The stereo sounds strange. You know that if it hides. It doesn't go away. If I get out of bed. You'll see me standing all alone. Horrified. On the stage. My little dark age. Giddy with delight. Seeing what's to come. The image of the dead. Dead ends in my mind. Policemen swear to God. Love's seeping from the guns. I know my friends and I. Would probably turn and run. If you get out of bed. Come find us heading for the bridge. Bring a stone. All the rage. My little dark age. I grieve in stereo. The stereo sounds strange. I know that if you hide. It doesn't go away. If you get out of bed. And find me standing all alone. Open-eyed. Burn the page. My little dark age. All alone. Open-eyed. Burn the page. My little dark age

she works out too much,"[woman's voice]. Get ready to have some fun!. Alright, here we go!. Five, four, three, two, and one. Are you ready to work out?. [verse 1]. Don't take it the wrong way. I can never keep up. Sick of liking your selfies. Should've gone with my gut. Maybe I'm in a movie. Maybe I'm out to lunch. But I'm constantly swiping it, tapping. It's never relaxing. I need a new routine. [chorus]. (he's trying). (she works out too much). The only reason we never worked out was. He didn't work out. (he's trying). (she works out too much).

alien days,"Sometimes the windows combine with the seams in a way. That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain. One foot leads to another. Night's for sleep, blue curtains, covers. Sequins in the eyes. That's a fine time to dine. Divine who's circling, feeding the cards to the midwives. Who love those alien days. The nonstop alien days. Mmm the alien days. Must've skipped the ship and joined the team. For a ride. A couple hours to learn the controls. And commandeer both my eyes. Hey! Be quick dear, times are uncertain. One month crawling, next year blurring. Decades in the drain. Monograms on the brain. Decide what's working and what's moved on to the last phase. The floodgate alien days. I love those alien days. Mmm the alien days. When the peels are down it feels like traveling in style. You don't need wings to hover forty ton stones for a mile. And in the summer, virgin visions. Mindless humming. Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile. Today find infinite ways it could be plenty worse. It's a blessing but it's also a curse. Those days taught me everything I know. How to catch a feeling and when to let it go. How all the scheming, soulless creatures. Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive. If it's right beneath the nose. And when the light is new. The sky shows trembling cartoons. You don't need smoke to cover. Most of the world in a gloom. But here comes racer number 7. Watch my fingers ripping out the lines. If it looks like we could lose.... If it looks like we could lose.... If it looks like we could lose.... If it looks like we could lose..."
me and michael,"Not everyone can be like me and Michael. The only problem is forgetting which side you're on. So you think the burning light. will reappear on summer nights. Like all the rest, but they can't find out. In every scene, it's me and Michael. Imaginary bombs raining down from the clouds. So it seems the danger signs. will never let the feelings die. When all the best and brightest have gone. Me and Michael. Solid as they come. Me and Michael. It's not a question now. It's me and Michael. Solid as they come. Me and Michael. It's not a question now. Me and Michael. Binary star sink like the setting sun. Too happy with ourselves to notice. when the change had come. So you think the losing side. would never break dividing lines. When sanctity wasn't a thing of doubt. Me and Michael. Solid as they come. Me and Michael. It's not a question now. It's me and Michael. Solid as they come. Me and Michael. It's not a question now. Me and Michael"
when you're small,"[verse 1]. When you're big. And troubles seem so far. You put your belly up to the bar. Squint your eyes. You can almost miss the dirt. You tell yourself. It couldn't hurt. [chorus]. But when you're small. You can't walk down the hall. When you're small. You're not very big at all. [verse 2]. When you're low. You reach a certain point. Where you can't really see the point. You can try. But, you can't see eye to eye. Yet when you're low then you really know. [bridge]. When you're high. It's easier to fight. When you're high. You don't have to know why. [chorus]. When you're small. You don't have very far to fall. When you're small. You feel like you belong. When you're small. You can curl into a ball. When you're small. No, you're not very big at all"
metanoia,"metanoia, reshaping the world. it can teach you. and re-program you. it can show you the flood that's trapped inside.. this one's alive!. the tail is breathing,. and she's listening.. kill the serpent, divide, disperse and grow,. into an oak.. a silver lining on a black scale.. wicked hunter,. on three hooves he still rode,. but where is the fourth?. you can climb there,. to your lofty perch.. It can teach you the fairytale of hurt.. Mystic Referee don't look on me with scorn.. I'm a child, I'm a lover being born.. (satchidananda). disregard the path I'm on. You can justify the action, should you bless. my ambition and my indecisiveness. (satchidananda). Let me know that you exist!. Watch me tremble as I'm answering the phone.. I am separate from everything you know.. Mystic referee I promise to return,. once I've given up and lessons have been learned.. (satchidananda). You can watch my fire burn.. We were talkin junk right,. just before the show.. This wild-eyed kid came up to the fence,. he took one look at us and he said:. ""HELP ME, DRUMMER! TICKET! YEAH!"". we didn't play his favorite song.. Now he'll never come to another show.. Hospitals and woods confirm red in the eyes of everyone.. Parasites and lovers scrape the meat from bones,. turned into jade and tiger's eye. Save me some dark hair over a face like her's. She'll help the rain come to a pour. Bathroom floor of stone and tiles broke in two, warm where they touch her porcelain timid skin. I'm careful to untie this road, wrapped in a knot indifferent. Lion's foot unearthing all the things I've seen but never truly understood. Rotten wood from oceans that were never green crumbles beneath the canopy, secretly. (let's pretend he never touched the sugar). Tonight, under rose, you won't find another wheel to roll. When autumn winds appear, we wear these fears on our right, it just wants to be surreal 'cause. All dressed in diamond image jeans, mercury's found a new field. We miserable in love, a chance we walk, and ride on in, into the streets of the city, but. Watching people disappear without reaching out for years and years,. you're left, by Yourself on the Wheel."
flash delirium,"Mild apprehension. Blank dreams of the coming fun. Distort the odds of a turnaround. Gut screams out next to none. So turn it on. Tune it in. And stay inert. You say ""I've got the backbone"". The back way to escape the gun. Climbing a tree with a missing limb. And not saving anyone. And now it hurts. To stay at home. And see. Flash. The mirror ball's throwing mold. You can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold. See the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt. But if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt. Plants. As far as I know are still,. Still bending toward the light. And if we dance. Until the heart explodes. It'll make this place ignite. And even if this hall collapses. I can stand by my pillar of hope it's just. A case of Flash delirium. Here's a growing culture. Deep inside a corpse. Ages stuck together. Takin it to the source. Timeless desperation. Pictures on a screen scream. ""Hey people, what does it mean?"". Comfort keeps us nice. So quick to donate everything (nothing arrives). Die wolken drifting blinding smiles circling (einkreisen). But time's tingling spines. Attaching hands to floor. The rosy-tinted flash. The hot dog's getting cold. And you'll never be as good as the Rolling Stones. Watch the birds in the airport gathering dirt. Crowd the clean magazine chick lifting up her skirt. (Why close one eye and try to. Pledge allegiance to the sun. When plastic ghosts start terrorizing everyone. Geometric troops aligning. Carried up to the burial mounds. My earthbound heart is heavy. Your heartbeat keeps things light. With the violence forever threatening the night. And even if this hall collapses. I can stand by my pillar of hope and trust). Lines when I close my eyes and just. Aim blindly at the sun. And hear love. When the ghosts start singing terrorizing everyone. Geometric troops aligning. Carried up to the burial mounds with gold. It's a heavy load but your. You rhythm makes it light and explode. Like a violent star keeps threatening the night. And even if this hall collapses. I can stand by my pillar of hope and trust. That our heads won't bust. 66 55 red battleships. 40 earthlike planets. 3 holes 2 tits. 1 fork in it's side. Zero tears in their eyes. Sue the spiders. Sink the Woelsh. Stab your facebook. Sell sell sell. Undercooked. Overdone. Mass adulation not so funny. Poisoned honey. Pseudo science. Silly money. You're my honey"
future reflections,"And there were future reflections. On the face and the hands. On a green colored island. On a primitive man. It was the future reflected. It felt familiar but new. A street was missing a building. The kids had something to do. There was a feeling the spirit was leaving. Red like a marker. So my tribe, with my knife. Cut the heart from a lonely life. I saw patterns on floorboards. Deep in the dust was a leader. Someone was walking on floorboards. Turned them from oak to cedar. He can assess the situation. I wrapped a string around my finger. Into the forest with the young ones. I don't expect to be a winner. But as long as you feel it. I'm a believer. My heart is phosphor. Sea rolls and death tolls. Break the surface don't break my bones. Off of the trail and off of your hands and. Onto a new plan. Is the cost to stay lost. Forever in an empty skin. Pale and thin. If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell. But pieces come together for some reason just as well. Their guns couldn't see us. There's a sea outside my door. And one day I'll appreciate. The rush of blood and the washed out beat of the shore. And remember what it felt like. To be alone. Sitting in the sunlight. All alone"
4th dimensional transition,"I feel your racing heart. My liquid silver arms extended. These waves aren't far apart. Black gold in clawfoot tubs unchanging. I am fire, where's my form?. Whisper crimson I intrude. There's light beneath your eyes. New overtones in view. Endless form, endless time. If what they say is true. You are a shadow in the fourth dimension. To float away with you. We see the corners where nothing happens. While we drifted we were one. Ceilings lifted walls were gone. You speak the language of the breeze. All your leaves were meant for me. The love that every person wants to be. Stuck together, I don't like revealing secrets. I'll live inside your lips if you won't laugh. My heaving hands on rotten fruit at last. Fallow fingers, there's a surface I can count on. She'd fit inside my heart and take it over. Till her cape got blown into my red lungs. Either there's a purpose. Or I'm heading out at breakfast. Take a drink, take a drag. One more coffee, ugly hat. No more mirrors, woolen bag. And I am gone"

a good sadness,"I can still hear the reflections in the air. Feeding time. Either hemisphere if it's summer there. Seeking you, taking a dive. Streets realigned. Ooh ooh ooh. Stored in my mind. All I could do not to steal. All the fun in the world. From your little heart. And now I owe it back to you. But it's hard to catch it and let it go. Find excuses to burn right through the grief. And to melt. Oh my poor memories. Down to a trace. 'Til you forget that I'm alive. And you feel it's all right. Ooh I'm sure you'll be fine. Tune it out and I'm sure you'll be fine. Doing well. Finding an excuse. Shutting down soon (over my eyes). Lost the recall. No line. Disprove. Mean time. Desperate. Confide. Inrush. Disprove. Mean time. Inrush. No line. Desperate. Confide. Inrush. Disprove. No line. Inrush. No line"
pieces of what,When the world has turned. Paralyzed and wrong. Cold blooded claws. Never offered anything at all. Past the point of love. Shattered and untied. Waiting to pick up the pieces. That make it all alright. But pieces of what. Pieces of what. Pieces of what. Doesn't matter any more. Moonlight on my floor. Is shining through the roof. They got the city surrounded. As if I needed proof. I forgot my fear. I feel it's on the rise. Buried by all of the pieces. Falling from the sky. But pieces of what. Pieces of what. Pieces of what. We used to call home. Pieces of what. We used to call home. Lay my dragon's teeth. And shallow water steel. At the belgian gates. I'm waiting for my meal
hand it over,"'Cause the deals we made to shake things up. In the rights that they abuse. Might just fuck us over. But the doors won't shut. Until they're sure there's nothing left to use. Someone's taking over. Threw it away, but now I say. It's time to hand it over. The joke's worn thin. The king stepped in. Oh, we'll see who is who. Look who's bending over. But the stars weren't wrong. The time felt right. We both know it was true. The smart ones exit early. And the rest hope for a shoulder. If we lose our touch. It won't mean much. If everyone's confused. Which door do we open?. It's the time same old trick. They played the hand. Now there's one thing to left to do. It's time (Hand it over). It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over). One thing on my mind (Hand it over). It's rightfully mine (Hand it over). In the dark (Hand it over). What's yours is mine (Hand it over).

weekend wars,"Evil Sis to find a shore,. A beast that doesn't quiver anymore,. Where we can crush some plants to paint my walls,. And I won't try to fight in the weekend wars. Was I? I was to lazy to bathe. Or paint or write or try to make a change.. Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch. And I don't have to love or think too much. Instant battle plans written on the sidewalk. Mental mystics in a twisted metal car. Tried to amplify the sound of light and love. Christ is cursed of fathers and mothers. Might even take a knife to split a hair. Or even scare the children off my lawn. Giving us time to make the makeshift bombs. Every mess invested was a score. We couldn't use computers anymore. But it's difficult to win unless you're bored,. And you might have to plan for the weekend wars. Try to break my heart I'll drive to Arizona.. It might take one hundred years to grow an arm. I'll sit and listen to the s iound of sand and cold. Twisted diamond heart, I'm the weekend warrior. My predictions are the only things I have. I can amplify the sound and light and love. I'm a curse and I'm a sound,. When I open up my mouth,. There's a reason I don't win,. I don't know how to begin. raoni_marqs"
tslamp,"[intro]. On my phone. [verse 1]. Time spent sitting all alone. Time spent looking at my phone. Time spent sitting all alone. Time spent looking at my phone. I try to pull the curtains back. Turn you off but can't detach. When all I want and all I know. Is time spent looking at my phone. (on my phone). [verse 2]. Find me when the lights go down. Signing in and signing out. Gods descend to take me home. Find me staring at my phone. I'm wondering where the hours went. As I'm losing consciousness. My sullen face is all aglow. Time spent looking at my phone. [chorus]. Last thing that you need. Is the new shiny feature. All the memories you've shared. Devoured by perverted creatures. Nothing can compete. With the first time you saw her. Passing strangers on the street. Spending every moment looking at their phones. (on my phone). [verse 3]. Time spent sitting all alone. Time spent looking at my phone. Time spent sitting all alone. Time spent looking at my phone. I call you, you don't call me back. Almost had a heart attack. I'm listening to the window moan. Time spent looking at my phone. [chorus]. Clouds are getting full. So you close all the windows. I would never let you die. Even if our love is ornamental. You know what you need. Is a way to remember. You can never find the time. If you spend everyday looking at your phone. [instrumental bridge]. [chorus]. You should come with me. We can lose ourselves in nothing. Copy faces from the feed. And then try to turn them into something. Even if you choose to believe that it's ending. You'll come back to me again. You can go ahead and stop pretending. [outro]. Doo doo doo doo doo"
"i love you too, death","Who is much more than a friend. But never by my side?. All beginnings are an end. In the blackness there? s a light. Maybe you will only read. One or two letters at the most. Shipping crates might line the streets. Every stranger is a ghost. Cashiers won? t deduct the pain. Loneliness sleeps on the couch. Only noticing the stain. Once the color? s faded out. Let? s go camping in the cold. Make a fire, buy a tent. Envision leather getting old. Re-send pigeons that were sent. Try to memorize your smell. It reminds me of a field. Crickets clearer than a bell. Have all their guts recast in steel. Birds don? t cry when echoes quit. They trail off into the fog. Autumn hurts far less than sticks. Knowing winter? s five feet tall. Generations of defeat. All assuming you're the worst. They never tied the cans. To the back end of a hearse. Take your hand against my own. If there? s a finger I can grip. Reassure me at the ace. Mine? s a black heart you could flip. I? ve come to terms with what I have. What? s been given, what? s been asked. Turn my back against the sea. And beg the serpent for a dance. But in the red dirt muddy towns. Celebration of the dark. Children walking hand in hand. With the pygmies in zee park. I can? t touch you only once. You always leave me wanting more. So keep my feet within the house. And stick my toes just past the door. Let me know when I? m in love. Let me die when I? m in love"

4th dimensional transition,"I feel your racing heart. My liquid silver arms extended. These waves aren't far apart. Black gold in clawfoot tubs unchanging. I am fire, where's my form?. Whisper crimson I intrude. There's light beneath your eyes. New overtones in view. Endless form, endless time. If what they say is true. You are a shadow in the fourth dimension. To float away with you. We see the corners where nothing happens. While we drifted we were one. Ceilings lifted walls were gone. You speak the language of the breeze. All your leaves were meant for me. The love that every person wants to be. Stuck together, I don't like revealing secrets. I'll live inside your lips if you won't laugh. My heaving hands on rotten fruit at last. Fallow fingers, there's a surface I can count on. She'd fit inside my heart and take it over. Till her cape got blown into my red lungs. Either there's a purpose. Or I'm heading out at breakfast. Take a drink, take a drag. One more coffee, ugly hat. No more mirrors, woolen bag. And I am gone"
a good sadness,"I can still hear the reflections in the air. Feeding time. Either hemisphere if it's summer there. Seeking you, taking a dive. Streets realigned. Ooh ooh ooh. Stored in my mind. All I could do not to steal. All the fun in the world. From your little heart. And now I owe it back to you. But it's hard to catch it and let it go. Find excuses to burn right through the grief. And to melt. Oh my poor memories. Down to a trace. 'Til you forget that I'm alive. And you feel it's all right. Ooh I'm sure you'll be fine. Tune it out and I'm sure you'll be fine. Doing well. Finding an excuse. Shutting down soon (over my eyes). Lost the recall. No line. Disprove. Mean time. Desperate. Confide. Inrush. Disprove. Mean time. Inrush. No line. Desperate. Confide. Inrush. Disprove. No line. Inrush. No line"
alien days,"Sometimes the windows combine with the seams in a way. That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain. One foot leads to another. Night's for sleep, blue curtains, covers. Sequins in the eyes. That's a fine time to dine. Divine who's circling, feeding the cards to the midwives. Who love those alien days. The nonstop alien days. Mmm the alien days. Must've skipped the ship and joined the team. For a ride. A couple hours to learn the controls. And commandeer both my eyes. Hey! Be quick dear, times are uncertain. One month crawling, next year blurring. Decades in the drain. Monograms on the brain. Decide what's working and what's moved on to the last phase. The floodgate alien days. I love those alien days. Mmm the alien days. When the peels are down it feels like traveling in style. You don't need wings to hover forty ton stones for a mile. And in the summer, virgin visions. Mindless humming. Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile. Today find infinite ways it could be plenty worse. It's a blessing but it's also a curse. Those days taught me everything I know. How to catch a feeling and when to let it go. How all the scheming, soulless creatures. Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive. If it's right beneath the nose. And when the light is new. The sky shows trembling cartoons. You don't need smoke to cover. Most of the world in a gloom. But here comes racer number 7. Watch my fingers ripping out the lines. If it looks like we could lose.... If it looks like we could lose.... If it looks like we could lose.... If it looks like we could lose..."
all we ever wanted was everything,"All we ever wanted was everything. All we ever got was cold. Get up, eat jelly. Sandwich bars, and barbed wires. Squash every week into a day.

Oh to be the cream. Oh to be the cream. Oh to be the cream. Oh to be the cream. Oh to be the cream"
an orphan of fortune,"It can't stop now. The signs keep changing on me. Like a shimmering bell. Long waves enveloping me. And my plastic mind. So chewed and shrieking all the time. Feels it whirling by. Morning, afternoon then night. And I can't get down. If I don't feel right. Polishing off the sand. Lay by me. And we'll erode. As gently as we can. Into twilight"
astro-mancy,"My green silken river and two lights. I could almost touch the free walls. When we were evicted from the heavens. Fast clouded-over bumbling eyes. Now peering out through a sinking. Cosmic smile, reversed completely. Flaming currents forced us to surface. Wet purple gowns and blaring alarms. All for some milky perversion. Nothing the spooks wouldn't be used to. Spoiled by an empty fear of violence. The only time I've ever been dropped. The minute the mirror turned its back to me. My distinct conviction of keeping. Eternal sources piled somewhere familiar. Was compromised and tangled in knots. For all I know we were sleeping. Arranged like Fate's vain infantry. Stacked in unconscious opposition. Blind and happy for tomorrow"

brian eno,"So tired, soul searching. I followed sounds to a cathedral. Imagine my surprise to find that. They were produced by Brian Eno!. Past the gates, quite stark. The roses trimmed and the windows dark. I see the walls through a limestone crack. Not red, not blue, not yellow, but black. And all the spaces left for you. If the sky was synthesized. You'd probably know. He taught me many things. The wisdom of oblique stratagems. The prophet of a sapphire soul. Presented through creative freedoms. And everything I say is true. 'Cause if I was telling lies. It'd probably show. I can tell when he's kind of smiling. But what does he know?. (What does he know?). We're always one step behind him. He's Brian Eno. Brian Eno! (x3). When I was stuck he'd make me. Memorize elaborate curses. Tinctures and formulas. To ditch the chori and flip the verses. My whole foundation came unglued. When I tried to humanize. By ambient light. Dipping swords in metaphors, yeah. But what does he know?. (What does he know?). We're always one step behind him. He's Brian Eno.. Brian Eno! (x3). He promised pretty worlds. and all the silence I could dream of. Brian Peter George St. Jean. Le Baptiste de la Salle Eno!. Well, all alone by the oldest stone. Where the shade trees grow. (What does he know?). The creature by the water feature. With the ghostly glow. Brian Eno, yeah!. He's making sure that time's preserved. Well, we reap what we sow. (What does he know?). We're always one step behind him. He's Brian Eno. Brian Eno, yeah!. I can tell that he's doing well, yeah. What does he know?. (What does he know?). I'm always one step behind him. He's Brian Eno. Brian Eno, yeah!. He dips swords in metaphors, yeah. What does he know?. (What does he know?). I'd like to see him plant a forest. 'Cause I don't know. Brian Eno, yeah!.

congratulations,"Dead in the water. It's not a paid vacation. The sons and daughters of city officials. Attend demonstrations. It's hardly a sink or swim. When all is well if the ticket sells. Out with a whimper. It's not a blaze of glory. You look down from your temple. As people endeavor to make it a story. And chisel a marble word. But all is lost if it's never heard. But I've got someone to make reports. That tell me how my money's spent. To book my stays and draw my blinds. So why can't you tell what's really there?. And all I need is a great big congratulations. I'll keep your dreams. You pay attention for me. As strange as it seems. I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me. The ground may be moving fast but. I tied my boots to a broken mast. The difference is clear. You throw it in your cauldron. Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn,. Steinways and Baldwins. You start with a simple stock of all the waste. And salt to taste. But damn my luck and damn these friends. That keep on combing back their smiles. I saved my grace with half-assed guilt. And lay down the quilt upon the lawn. Spread my arms and soak up. Congratulations!"
cool song no. 2,"Whenever I drift by the unknown. Feign like I notice a fundamental tone. The fine petals open. And close, offended. Poor explanation and nothing shown. Kind of like if a friend. Exits without a sign. Glimmering like a precious stone. Maybe we shared a dream. For twenty nights in a row. I might feel better knowing that I was alone. Wherever scientists turn lead to birds. Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth. What you find shocking. They find amusing. Something else to soften a sadistic urge. When they tell you the extent of the vice. Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician. And like the senses that you're lurking behind. While it gnaws right through to your core. Oh, I'd twist it more. If you think that you're free (free like a kite). Watching as it goes by (spy the unknown). Focus on the quiet oars. Tell me how far you'd go (go where you like). Knowing your air won't last (last one to know). Would you feel better holding the stars up?. What if the beast escapes (apes have it good). And separates like a cloud (loud like a fault). Seeps into the hollow bones?. Wouldn't its eyes expand. And zero in like a scope?. I might feel better. Knowing I wasn't alone"

flash delirium,"Mild apprehension. Blank dreams of the coming fun. Distort the odds of a turnaround. Gut screams out next to none. So turn it on. Tune it in. And stay inert.

The mirror ball's throwing mold. You can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold. See the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt. But if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt. Plants. As far as I know are still,. Still bending toward the light. And if we dance. Until the heart explodes. It'll make this place ignite. And even if this hall collapses. I can stand by my pillar of hope it's just. A case of Flash delirium. Here's a growing culture. Deep inside a corpse. Ages stuck together. Takin it to the source. Timeless desperation. Pictures on a screen scream. ""Hey people, what does it mean?"". Comfort keeps us nice. So quick to donate everything (nothing arrives). Die wolken drifting blinding smiles circling (einkreisen). But time's tingling spines. Attaching hands to floor. The rosy-tinted flash. The hot dog's getting cold. And you'll never be as good as the Rolling Stones. Watch the birds in the airport gathering dirt. Crowd the clean magazine chick lifting up her skirt. (Why close one eye and try to. Pledge allegiance to the sun.

future reflections,"And there were future reflections. On the face and the hands. On a green colored island. On a primitive man. It was the future reflected. It felt familiar but new. A street was missing a building. The kids had something to do. There was a feeling the spirit was leaving. Red like a marker. So my tribe, with my knife. Cut the heart from a lonely life. I saw patterns on floorboards. Deep in the dust was a leader. Someone was walking on floorboards. Turned them from oak to cedar. He can assess the situation. I wrapped a string around my finger. Into the forest with the young ones. I don't expect to be a winner. But as long as you feel it. I'm a believer. My heart is phosphor. Sea rolls and death tolls. Break the surface don't break my bones. Off of the trail and off of your hands and. Onto a new plan. Is the cost to stay lost. Forever in an empty skin. Pale and thin. If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell. But pieces come together for some reason just as well. Their guns couldn't see us. There's a sea outside my door. And one day I'll appreciate. The rush of blood and the washed out beat of the shore. And remember what it felt like. To be alone. Sitting in the sunlight. All alone"

Generations of defeat. All assuming you're the worst. They never tied the cans. To the back end of a hearse. Take your hand against my own. If there? s a finger I can grip. Reassure me at the ace. Mine? s a black heart you could flip. I? ve come to terms with what I have. What? s been given, what? s been asked. Turn my back against the sea. And beg the serpent for a dance.

I see the signs of aging. But if I try to feel at all I am deceived. My mind's affected. It's empty now. As I lay down. I feel alright. My heart is racing. Turn the noise on. I'd like to feed my poison. Assembly lines. Carry a velvet warning. To the yard. It's just like striking matches. The polish lies. But it's working in your blood. Which you know is not the same as love. Love is only in your mind. And not your heart. No, it's working. It's working in your blood. Which you know is not the same as love. Love is only in your mind and not your heart"
james,"James. You heed the call. You go outside, you walk along. You're always there. Forever you. You can always say that you've. James. If you need a friend. And I know that. And I'll be there. My door is always open. James. Just know that"
kids,You were a child. Crawling on your knees toward it. Making momma so proud. But your voice is too loud. We like to watch you laughing. You pick the insects off plants. No time to think of consequences. (Chorus). Control yourself. Take only what you need from him. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Control yourself. Take only what you need from him. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. The water is warm. But it's sending me shivers. A baby is born. Crying out for attention. Memories fade. Like looking through a fogged mirror. Decisions too. Decisions are made and not bought. But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot. I guess not. Control yourself. Take only what you need from him. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Control yourself. Take only what you need from him. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Chorus x6
little dark age,Breathing in the dark. Lying on its side. The ruins of the day. Painted with a scar. And the more I straighten out. The less it wants to try. The feelings start to rot. One wink at a time. Forgiving who you are. For what you stand to gain. Just know that if you hide. It doesn't go away. When you get out of bed. Don't end up stranded. Horrified with each stone. On the stage. My little dark age. Picking through the cards. Knowing what's nearby. The carvings on the face. Say they find it hard. And the engine's failed again. All limits of disguise. The humor's not the same. Coming from denial. I grieve in stereo. The stereo sounds strange. I know that if you hide. It doesn't go away. If you get out of bed. And find me standing all alone. Open-eyed. Burn the page. My little dark age. I grieve in stereo. The stereo sounds strange. You know that if it hides. It doesn't go away. If I get out of bed. You'll see me standing all alone. Horrified. On the stage. My little dark age. Giddy with delight. Seeing what's to come. The image of the dead. Dead ends in my mind. Policemen swear to God. Love's seeping from the guns. I know my friends and I. Would probably turn and run. If you get out of bed. Come find us heading for the bridge. Bring a stone. All the rage. My little dark age. I grieve in stereo. The stereo sounds strange. I know that if you hide. It doesn't go away. If you get out of bed. And find me standing all alone. Open-eyed. Burn the page. My little dark age. All alone. Open-eyed. Burn the page. My little dark age
love always remains,"there's a place I'd like to go somewhere out west,. it's not specific, and the pictures show it best.. I know there's trees I know there's sand and I know there's grass,. I know it's somewhere in the past.. There's a girl out there who's lookin for it too,. she's not sure when she'll go or exactly what she'll do.. If i am doomed am I the first on or the last?. Am I just someone from the past?. No one has to hear, the sound of people laughing at their fear, and the ocean and sun are always there, to make you happy if you're feeling scared of the darkness.. If I ever saw a ghost it'd change the way I think.. I wouldn't gasp for air if ever I did sink.. I wouldn't struggle, I'd just let it all out fast,. and then start living in the past.. If we hold the hand that rapes the hand,. and everyone can feel the hand,. and nothing's gonna change,. it could be the time we're living in,. we'll never feel so safe again,. but love always remains"

me and michael,"Not everyone can be like me and Michael. The only problem is forgetting which side you're on. So you think the burning light. will reappear on summer nights. Like all the rest, but they can't find out. In every scene, it's me and Michael. Imaginary bombs raining down from the clouds. So it seems the danger signs. will never let the feelings die. When all the best and brightest have gone. Me and Michael. Solid as they come. Me and Michael. It's not a question now. It's me and Michael. Solid as they come. Me and Michael. It's not a question now. Me and Michael. Binary star sink like the setting sun. Too happy with ourselves to notice. when the change had come. So you think the losing side. would never break dividing lines. When sanctity wasn't a thing of doubt. Me and Michael. Solid as they come. Me and Michael. It's not a question now. It's me and Michael. Solid as they come. Me and Michael. It's not a question now. Me and Michael"

YEAH!"". we didn't play his favorite song.. Now he'll never come to another show.. Hospitals and woods confirm red in the eyes of everyone.. Parasites and lovers scrape the meat from bones,. turned into jade and tiger's eye. Save me some dark hair over a face like her's. She'll help the rain come to a pour. Bathroom floor of stone and tiles broke in two, warm where they touch her porcelain timid skin. I'm careful to untie this road, wrapped in a knot indifferent. Lion's foot unearthing all the things I've seen but never truly understood. Rotten wood from oceans that were never green crumbles beneath the canopy, secretly. (let's pretend he never touched the sugar). Tonight, under rose, you won't find another wheel to roll. When autumn winds appear, we wear these fears on our right, it just wants to be surreal 'cause. All dressed in diamond image jeans, mercury's found a new field. We miserable in love, a chance we walk, and ride on in, into the streets of the city, but. Watching people disappear without reaching out for years and years,. you're left, by Yourself on the Wheel."

mystery disease,"It can't pay attention. What slips into the system. A light touch, a whisper that puts you to sleep. Don't sympathize with the mystery disease. All it is is a feeling. Pain in a dress too revealing. A lost bond. An old friend who likes what it sees. You can't shake off the mystery disease. Lovers in a past life. Meet in the street close to midnight. A last look. Sweet like the end of a dream. Then fall back into the mystery disease. Go on, tell your symptoms to me. It's not in any of the books you can read. It's no fun to face what you don't get to be. Mas what's one more to the mystery disease?. Floating impatience. Snuffs my limited sapience. Black smoke as soon as the pressure's released. Deep space sighs, the Mystery Disease. Consumed by a weakness. Cut with perpetual unrest. You see stars, sunsets blurred through a screen. Trap what you want. Waste what you need. And when the west wind sweeps through the leaves. Emperors of history fall to their knees. Small fronds can't see the wood for the trees. Left in the dust of the mystery disease"
"of moons, birds & monsters","Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?. Don't you know about the temperature change. In the cold black shadow?. Are you mad at your walls. Or hoping that an unknown force can repair things for you?. Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale grey garden?. If the ship will never come you've got to move along. Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark. The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start. The falling apart. Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder. The waves of black. If she's going under I can hold my breath till the sky comes back. Or drown like a rat, rat, rat. He's a rat!. To catch a monster. We make a movie. Set the tempo. And cut and cut its brains out. It will inspire on the burning pyre. Half the distance. Half the motion. Communication. It's easy as the ocean"
one thing left to try,"[verse 1]. One thing left to try. See if you can make it. Before you choose the night. And the silence overtakes you. If you looked into the fire. And you had that conversation. Then there's one thing left to try. If you want to save your life. [refrain 1]. Fear is his name, but his friends still call him god. Again and again the thought remains. (the only way to get rid of the feeling). [verse 2]. I don't wanna die!. Wishing I'd done something. More than what's required. To last until the sunset. No, I don't wanna die. Thinking that I'm dreaming. There's one thing left to try. If you want to change your life. [refrain 2]. Today I left those thoughts behind, behind. Over and over, you die just to feel alive. [bridge]. The only way to get rid of the feeling. You have to draw the line. And remember there's more than you're seeing. Decide. [outro].

pieces of what,When the world has turned. Paralyzed and wrong. Cold blooded claws. Never offered anything at all. Past the point of love. Shattered and untied. Waiting to pick up the pieces. That make it all alright. But pieces of what. Pieces of what. Pieces of what. Doesn't matter any more. Moonlight on my floor. Is shining through the roof. They got the city surrounded. As if I needed proof. I forgot my fear. I feel it's on the rise. Buried by all of the pieces. Falling from the sky. But pieces of what. Pieces of what. Pieces of what. We used to call home. Pieces of what. We used to call home. Lay my dragon's teeth. And shallow water steel. At the belgian gates. I'm waiting for my meal
plenty of girls in the sea,"There's plenty of girls in the sea. And plenty of seeds in a lemon. The trick is in trying to stay free. When it's never that great to begin with. The surgeon performs precise little cuts. But he's never perfect, he's thinking too much. And it's really no comfort to me. There's plenty of girls in the sea. There's plenty of girls in the sea. And plenty of those are not women. As soon as you get yourself free. Then somebody stops you from swimming. The lifeguard admits, his whistle in hand. That it isn't the muscle, and it isn't the tan. No it's whatever you want it to be. There's plenty of girls in the sea. Ah the passionate painter will say with a brush. ""it's best to accept it and not make a fuss. Just cause the grass isn't green"". Yeah, there's plenty of girls in the sea. There's plenty of girls in the sea. And plenty of clowns in the village. The trick is to try to be free. And tend to the void, don't just fill it. The bartender concedes, from inside his vest. That none of the best ones were ever the best. So keep it short, simple and sweet. Cause there's plenty of girls in the sea. Whenever you want there to be"

siberian breaks,"Sweep as the goer. The bridge that watches the light speed thru. And cries while the spirit stumbles. And inside missile for the protection of you. Maybe it's silent. The voice can't bear anymore strain. But speak without even knowing. And streams outside in the direction of truth. There's no reason. There's no secret to decode. If you can't save it leave it dying on the road. Wide open arms can feel so cold. So cold. Feel so cold. Balance the books, the ledges, the loons. The disappointed look on the faces. That squint at the moon. Let's see it with shadows enhance. And then vote to decide who'll advance. Silver jet plane, making a turn. Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn. It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed. If you're conscious you must be depressed. Or at least cynical. But someone might still eat the steaks. Even if they're tough. Spending the day. Chewing the fat. Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough. Oh marianne, pass me the joint. The sandpaper's tan. Go-getters are surfing the point. And London's a cratch on the lens. It's over before it begins. Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders. The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick. But really there's no trip at all. That doesn't result in a fall. Or a faltering. But something could spit out the bait. Even if it's real. Rolling away. Missing a spoke. Close to the ground like a wheel but it's not joke. Holding the line. Clutching the phone. Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right. It's not right. Smelling for blood. Praying for rain. Running away isn't rough,. But it's not enough. The low tide is telling me when it's over. To breathe in everything exposed. And comes back to cover me with a blanket. Being here's always changing tunes. The empty sky surrounds me but i can't see at all. Wde open arms can feel so cold. And you can sit beside me. And tell me what it's worth. But I hope I die before i get sold. I hope I die before I get sold. I'd rather die before I get sold. If you find the soul that you lost. Frozen in a starry void. Take it within and hope the sight of blood. Can will signs of life to return. Back to the way that it was. Long before it made a noise. To keep on quietly reminding you. What's never created or destroyed. Wake as the swell peaks. The close-outs drowning the birds with roars. And howls scare the new unkindness. That picks and laughs at the carrion scene. Forces you see breath. Can always go into hiding. And wait 'til it passes over. Or stay far gone for all eternity"
someone's missing,"Someone's telling the toll to me. I'm cut and I'm weeping like a rubber tree. But I don't care who's left behind. Lost revelations that I'll never find. In the long hall pipes are whispering. Blues prepared for anti-christening. Somewhere there's an honest soul. To mirror teeth where neon lures troll. And what's extinct might come alive. A purple smoke in some internal shrine. With a long sigh let the hissing in. Stones deformed by gentle kissing and. All the closed eyes start to glisten. But it feels like someone's missing. It feels like someone's missing. Yeah, it feels like someone's missing. It feels like someone's missing. Repeat (x5). It feels like someone's missing. Yeah, it feels like someone's missing"
song for dan treacy,"He spends his time. or maybe half of his time. or part of the time wandering. 'round the creeks and cobble stones of hackney lanes.

To know when your time's up. you flip the glass and watch the hours quickening. oh oh oh oh oh. In the back of the station. fluorescent lights about to quit their flickering. well he speaks his mind. He says ""what is crime?"". Dan Treacy's eyes. In the middle of the park. when the underground is dark,. he's a poet he's a lark. he starts thinking about a place that no one knows. And when the creeks run dry. he stays frozen in time. strange lights in the sky. start blinking. I can see the car outside but he's listening. he's listening. and he's making up his mind. He made his mind up. to get things done and overcome. He made his mind up. yeah he's gonna let it go. he made his mind up. in the park and at the station. he made his mind up. yeah, he's gonna get it done. he made his mind up. ooh yeah he's gonna get it done. he made his mind up. yeah, he's gonna let it go, uh oh.

the handshake,"I just shook the handshake. I just sealed the deal. I'll try not to let them. Take everything they can steal. People always told me. Don't forget your roots. I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots. You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds and you watch it go. Your fairweather friends on a parachute binge get lost when the wind blows. The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue. It tastes like death but it looks like fun. I was a loner. I was just waiting by myself. When you, warped temptress. Rose to bring me happiness and wealth. Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes. You can call all the people you want. But it's you who's being used. Under your black eyes, honey. Right beneath your nose. A curse on all creation. Every single thing you know. White smoke, white light, white marble on the floor. It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store. Little girl. You convince yourself that you want it, but you don't know. You keep trying to wash the blood from your hands, but it won't go. We're gonna keep you on the run. We got the handshake under our tongue. We got the handshake under our tongue. We got the handshake under our tongue. We got the handshake under our tongue. We got the handshake x15"

tslamp,"[intro]. On my phone. [verse 1]. Time spent sitting all alone. Time spent looking at my phone. Time spent sitting all alone. Time spent looking at my phone. I try to pull the curtains back. Turn you off but can't detach. When all I want and all I know. Is time spent looking at my phone. (on my phone). [verse 2]. Find me when the lights go down. Signing in and signing out. Gods descend to take me home. Find me staring at my phone. I'm wondering where the hours went. As I'm losing consciousness. My sullen face is all aglow. Time spent looking at my phone. [chorus]. Last thing that you need. Is the new shiny feature. All the memories you've shared. Devoured by perverted creatures. Nothing can compete. With the first time you saw her. Passing strangers on the street. Spending every moment looking at their phones. (on my phone). [verse 3]. Time spent sitting all alone. Time spent looking at my phone. Time spent sitting all alone. Time spent looking at my phone. I call you, you don't call me back. Almost had a heart attack. I'm listening to the window moan. Time spent looking at my phone. [chorus]. Clouds are getting full. So you close all the windows. I would never let you die. Even if our love is ornamental. You know what you need. Is a way to remember. You can never find the time. If you spend everyday looking at your phone. [instrumental bridge]. [chorus]. You should come with me. We can lose ourselves in nothing. Copy faces from the feed.

weekend wars,"Evil Sis to find a shore,. A beast that doesn't quiver anymore,. Where we can crush some plants to paint my walls,. And I won't try to fight in the weekend wars. Was I? I was to lazy to bathe. Or paint or write or try to make a change.. Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch. And I don't have to love or think too much. Instant battle plans written on the sidewalk. Mental mystics in a twisted metal car. Tried to amplify the sound of light and love. Christ is cursed of fathers and mothers. Might even take a knife to split a hair. Or even scare the children off my lawn. Giving us time to make the makeshift bombs. Every mess invested was a score. We couldn't use computers anymore. But it's difficult to win unless you're bored,. And you might have to plan for the weekend wars. Try to break my heart I'll drive to Arizona.. It might take one hundred years to grow an arm. I'll sit and listen to the s iound of sand and cold. Twisted diamond heart, I'm the weekend warrior. My predictions are the only things I have. I can amplify the sound and light and love. I'm a curse and I'm a sound,. When I open up my mouth,. There's a reason I don't win,. I don't know how to begin. raoni_marqs"
when you die,"[verse 1]. I'm not that nice. I'm mean and I'm evil. Don't call me nice. I'm gonna eat your heart out. I've got some work to do. Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off. [verse 2]. Go fuck yourself. You heard me right. Don't call me nice again. Don't you have somewhere to be at seven thirty?. Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready. Ready to blow my brains out. [chorus 1]. You die. And words won't do anything. It's permanently night. And I won't feel anything. We'll all be laughing with you when you die. [chorus 2]. Words won't do anything. It's permanently night. And I won't feel anything. We'll all be laughing with you when you die. [verse 3]. Go fuck yourself. I'm mean, not nice. You said it twice. You said it twice. Don't you have somewhere to be at seven thirty?. [interlude]. I've got some work to do. I'm gonna eat your heart out. I heard you the first time"
when you're small,"[verse 1]. When you're big. And troubles seem so far. You put your belly up to the bar. Squint your eyes. You can almost miss the dirt. You tell yourself. It couldn't hurt. [chorus]. But when you're small. You can't walk down the hall. When you're small. You're not very big at all. [verse 2]. When you're low. You reach a certain point. Where you can't really see the point. You can try. But, you can't see eye to eye. Yet when you're low then you really know. [bridge]. When you're high. It's easier to fight. When you're high. You don't have to know why. [chorus]. When you're small. You don't have very far to fall. When you're small. You feel like you belong. When you're small. You can curl into a ball. When you're small. No, you're not very big at all"
your life is a lie,Here's the deal. Open your eyes. Your life is a lie. Don't say a word. I'll tell you why. You're living a lie. Your life is a lie. But you deny. You ever lied. Wondering why. Bury your life. Count your friends. On your hands. Now look again. They're not your friends. Hold your breath. Everyone left. No surprise. Living a lie. Tell your wife. This is your life. Your life is a lie. This is your wife. Now she knows. She understands. Her life is a lie. Nobody wins. Try not to cry. You'll survive. On your own. Lessons in life. Your life is a lie. Now there's no time. Wondering why. Where in the world. Is that girl?. He knows it's allright. To live a life. Waiting to die. Not knowing that. Your life is a lie. Wondering why. Nobody writes. Hollow inside. Periods in light. Fire and ice. Your life is a lie. Your life is a lie. Your life is a lie. Your life is a lie. On your own. One more time. Your life is a lie
