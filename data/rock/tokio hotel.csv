And when I lose myself I'll think of you,. Together we'll be running somewhere new.... Through the monsoon.. Just me and you.. A half moon's fading from my sight,. I see your vision in its light.. But now it's gone and left me so alone. I know I have to find you now,. Can hear your name, I don't know how.. Why can't we make this darkness feel like home?. CHORUS. Running through the monsoon,. Beyond the world,. To the end of time,. Where the rain won't hurt. Fighting the storm,. Into the blue,. And when I lose myself I'll think of you,. Together we'll be running somewhere new.... And nothing can hold me back from you.. Through the monsoon. Hey! Hey!. BRIDGE. I'm fighting all this power,. Coming in my way. Let it take me straight to you,. I'll be running night and day.. I'll be with you soon.... Just me and you.. We'll be there soon.... So soon.. CHORUS. Running through the monsoon,. Beyond the world,. To the end of time,. Where the rain won't hurt.

This gift is what you need. You're gonna be alright. Eyes close and fall. Her first time on the edge. The scars will stay forever. Side to side with death. A moment that feels better. Darkness and light are blinding her sight. She's not coming back. It's getting light outside. She cannot sleep 'cause time stands still. Someone's hand is touching her, she has no will. Each time when it hurts, she just feels so alone. She doesn't care at all. Her memories have long gone. Eyes close and fall. And closer to the edge. The scars will stay forever. Side to side with death. This time feels even better. Darkness and light are blinding her sight. She's not coming back. She shuts the door. She longs for more and more. And more. She shuts the door. She longs for more and more. And more. Just once more. Everyone is watching. Her arms are so sore. But she doesn't care anymore. And falling from the edge. The scars will stay forever. Side to side with death. This last time even better. Darkness and light are blinding her sight. She's not coming back. Not coming back. The sky is casting over. Her last wish stays unsaid"

Everybody says that time heals the pain. I've been waitin' forever. That day never came. You said I'd be comin' home. They said he's fine left alone. The screams in my mind. I keep them a secret.... A secret. Doctors and your promises. Psychics, healers, I've seen the best. Whatever they sell sure know how to deal it. Gonna be ok, gonna be ok. One day. One day. [Chorus]. Gonna be ok, gonna be ok. One day. One day. [Chorus]"
the heart get no sleep,"You said it's okay. I said I'm happy. Can you love me like you loved me?. Just one more time. My heart's a jungle. I escape in to the city lights. I dive into the colors. And it's alright, it's alright. And I can set the world on fire. Just to see you come undone. I'm falling out, it feels like flying. Into the daylight, into the daylight. And I can set the world on fire. Just to see you come undone. We never had enough, come higher. Into the daylight. The heart get no sleep. The heart get no sleep. The heart get no sleep. I've driven fantasy. With burning diamonds. Feels so united. You hurt like love. We keep our secrets. And she rock it to the silence. Touch me like a ritual. Come take it off, just take it off. And I can set the world on fire. Just to see you come undone. I'm falling out, it feels like flying. Into the daylight. The heart get no sleep. The heart get no sleep. The heart get no sleep. The heart get no sleep. Love me, come love me. The heart get no sleep. Love me, like we've never been hurt. Like we've never been hurt. The heart get no sleep. The heart get no sleep. The heart get no sleep"
we found us,"Fire in the sky. Shadows unite. The world is outside. We hide. Beats fight a war. Close the door,. Close the door,. Searching for the cure. On the floor. We found us us. In this club club. We found us us. It hurts. But it feels right. We found us us. In this club club. We found us us. It hurts. But it feels right. Tears fallin? down. Underground underground. Following the sound. Of the crowd. Reflection of the light. In your eyes. In your eyes. We are rising high. Tonight. We found us us. In this club club. We found us us. It hurts. But it feels right. We found us us. In this club club. We found us us. It hurts. But it feels right. We don?t care. We don?t care. We don?t care. We don?t care. We don?t care. Don?t care. It hurts but it feels right.

what if,"I am down for something. Come pick me up in your car. Don't let me down for nothing. I wanna know who you are. And if you down for something. I want a piece of your heart. Come let's just not do anything. Give me a piece of the stars. We high as fuck nowhere to be. No second chance in this galaxy. It could be you it could be me. So let us be. You and I. What if I would love you till the end?. You would never be alone again. What if I would love you till the end?. You would never be alone again. (What if, What if Baby?). It's five a. m. and that's nothing. Get you back in the car. We're getting lost in some new place. At least we know who we are. We high as fuck nowhere to be. No second chance in this galaxy. It could be you it could be me. So let us be. You and I. What if I would love you till the end?. You would never be alone again. What if I would love you till the end?. You would never be alone again. What if I would love you till the end?. You would never be alone again. What if I would love you till the end?. You would never be alone again. What if. What if.

world behind my wall,"It's raining today, the blinds are shut. It's always the same. I tried all the games that they play. But they made me insane. Life on TV it's random. But it means nothing to me. I'm writing down what I cannot see. Wanna wake up in a dream. Oh, oh. They're telling me it's beautiful. I believe them, but will I ever know. The world behind my wall. Oh, oh. The sun will shine like never before. One day I will be ready to go. See the world behind my wall. Trains in the sky are travelling. Through fragments of time. They're taking me to parts of my mind. That no one can find. I'm ready to fall. I'm ready to crawl on my kness to know it all. I'm ready to heal. I'm ready to feel. Oh, oh. They're telling me it's beautiful. I believe them, but will I ever know. The world behind my wall. Oh, oh. The sun will shine like never before. One day I will be ready to go. See the world behind my wall. See the world behind my wall. I'm ready to fall. I'm ready to crawl on my kness to know it all. I'm ready to heal. I'm ready to feel. Take me there!. Oh, oh. Take me there!. Take me there!. Oh, oh. They're telling me it's beautiful. I believe them, but will I ever know. the world behind my wall"
zoom into me,Is there anybody out there. Walking alone. Is there anybody out there. Out in the cold. One hearbeat. Lost in the crowd. Is there anybody shouting. What no one can hear. Is there anybody drownin'. Pulled down by the fear. I feel you. Don't look away. Zoom into me. Zoom into me. I know you're scared. When you can't breath. I will be there. Zoom into me. Is there anybody laughing. To kill the pain. Is there anybody screamin'. The silence away. Just open your jaded eyes. Zoom into me. Zoom into me. I know you're scared. When you can't breath. I will be there. Zoom into me. Come closer. And closer. When you can't breath. I will be there. Zoom into me. Zoom into me. Zoom into me. When the world. Cuts your soul into pieces. And you start to bleed. When you can't breath. I will be there. Zoom into me
