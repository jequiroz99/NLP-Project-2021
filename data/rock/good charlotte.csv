self help,"All I have right now is right here. And right now. I want what I want, I always have. When no one cared about me. dreams were all I had. But nightmares grow and no one's listening. And idle thoughts'll do their thing. I still feel so much pain here from the past. And it cuts like a knife. It feels like a fight. To take back your life. Searching for the meaning. I'm living in these feelings. I'm ready for a reason to believe. Now I'm working on my insides. 'Cause outside there's no reasoning. If anyone's here it's never what it seems. All I have right now is right here. I felt too bad about myself. I never thought I was good enough for anybody else. I couldn't look love in the eye. I was too broken to try. Life was a cold song that taught me not to cry. And it cuts like a knife. It feels like a fight. To take back your life. Searching for the meaning. I'm living in these feelings. I'm ready for a reason to believe. Now I'm working on my insides. 'Cause outside there's no reasoning. If anyone's here it's never what it seems. How long I waited. Feeling lost, frustrated. Locked out and I'm on my own. Cornered and ain't got no place to go. How long should I stay here all alone. Searching for the meaning. I'm living in these feelings. I'm ready for a reason to believe. Now I'm working on my insides. 'Cause outside there's no reasoning. If anyone's here it's never what it seems"
cold song,"I want you to know, you're not alone. Everything you are and everything you're not. When happiness dies and the pain, it will come. Life's funny, it's a game we play. You know we run. I wonder when I get back home. Is there really any way of knowing. If I did this right. Cause I'm just not sure if I'm ready for it. And should I even try it out. If I don't know where I'm going. So I close my eyes, and I say my prayers. Maybe life will show me. Are you looking out? Are you looking in?. Where does this start? And where does it end?. The night can get so dark, in this dream we're living in. Where does this start? Tell me where does it end. The universe is hard sometimes. Just like an angry mother. Then your life can be so hard sometimes. We gotta hold on to each other. Are you looking out? Are you looking in?. Where does this start? And where does it end?. The night can get so dark, in this dream we're living in. Where does this start? Tell me where does it end. I wonder when I get back home. Is there really any way of knowing. If I did this right. Cause I'm just not sure if I'm ready for it. And should I even try it out. If I don't know where I'm going. So I close my eyes, and I say my prayers. Maybe life will show me. I want you to know, you're not alone. Everything you are and everything you're not. When happiness dies and the pain, it will come. Life's funny, it's a game we play. You know we run"

prayers,Born alone on a lonely planet. Full of broken dreams. Where no one understands me. When I finally met an angel. I didn't know what to say. She just held my hand. And we would lay awake at night. Looking at the stars. Thinking of the ones we've lost. And wonder where they are. When we lit another candle. She asked me who's to blame. Then she put her arms around me. And held me to the flame. So why do we hurt each other. We don't hear the words from one another's. Prayers. They don't mean a thing at all. Do they answer when you call. These prayers. When you don't mean what you say. Would you die for me today. Now I just can't relate. None of this makes sense. In this reality. God just leaves the room when I turn on my TV. I see a little girl who's crying because she lost her family. All these strangers sending thoughts and prayers. She's buried underneath. Why do we kill each other. We can't feel the pain in one another's. Prayers. They don't mean a thing at all. Do they answer when you call. These prayers. When you don't mean what you say. Would you die for me today. Now I just can't relate. We're so far away from one another. We keep building walls between each other's. Prayers. They don't mean a thing at all. Do they answer when you call. These prayers. When you don't mean what you say. Would you die for me today. Now I just can't relate. Prayers. They don't mean a thing at all. Do they answer when you call. These prayers. When you don't mean what you say. Would you die for me today

Do you really want to be like them?. Do you really wanna be another trend?. Do you wanna be part of the crowd?. Cause I don't ever wanna. I don't ever wanna be you. Don't wanna be just like you. What I'm sayin' is. This is the anthem. Throw all your hands up. You, don't wanna be you. Shake it once that's fine. Shake it twice that's ok. Shake it 3 times you're playing with yourself again. You, don't wanna be just like you (what I'm sayin' is). This is the anthem. Throw all your hands up. Y'all got to feel me. Sing if you're with me. You, don't wanna be just like you (just like you).

"the river (feat. m. shadows, synyster gates)","As I walk through the valley. Of the shadow of la. The footsteps that were next to me. Have gone their separate ways. I've seen enough now. To know that beautiful things. Don't always stay that way. I've done enough now. To know this beautiful place. Isn't everything they say. I heard that evil comes disguised. Like a city of angels. I'm walking towards the light. Baptized in the river. I've seen a vision of my life. And I wanna be delivered. In the city was a sinner. I've done a lot of things wrong. But I swear I'm a believer. Like the prodigal son. I was out on my own. Now I'm trying to find my way back home. Baptized in the river. I'm delivered. I'm delivered. You're from a small town. You're gonna grow up fast. Underneath these lights. Down in hollywood. On the boulevard the dead come back to life. To the praying mother. And the worried father. Let your children go. If they come back. They'll come home stronger. And if they don't you'll know. They say that evil comes disguised. Like a city of angels. I'm walking towards the light. Baptized in the river.

Tell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself. Do you even see at all?. All this hate, you chose to throw your life away. Do you even see at all?. All your little shameful looks. Were buried in my heart like hooks. I didn't want to be here. You told me I was evil. And when I finally ran away. Just trying to escape that pain. I wanted to believe I belonged somewhere on my own.

harlow's song (i can't dream without you),"I can't dream without you?. When you close your eyes and go to sleep tonight. I'll be right outside your door. Dreams will come and they?ll take you away. Let them bring you back to me. And tomorrow when you wake, I'll be next to you. Full protection from the day. When the tears fall down your face like morning dull. I'll be there to put a smile on your face. And I?ll say. Chorus:. I don't wanna live this life without you. I don't wanna spend the night without you. I don't wanna know what it's like. I can't dream without you (2x). Let your fire burn bright for the world to see. You are the better part of me. When you hold my hand I swear that I believe. I'm living in my wildest dreams. And I say. I don't wanna live this life without you. I don't wanna spend the night without you. I don't wanna know what it's like. Flowers for your hair, rainbows for your eyes to see. Your dreams are everywhere. To carry you away from me. Away from me, someday (2x). I don't wanna live this life without you. I don't wanna spend the night without you. I don't wanna know what it's like. I don't wanna live this life without you. I don't wanna spend the night without you. I don't wanna know what it's like"

Take apart this heart tell me where to start. No book that I can find has the answer. A medicine can't cure the fact that I'm still yours. Even though you've gone on without me.

The night can get so dark, in this dream we're living in. Where does this start? Tell me where does it end. The universe is hard sometimes. Just like an angry mother.

I see my breathe in the cold of the air that I breathe and I'm. wondering I'm wondering if it's you that i feel if it's you that I feel here. haunting me forever. I have been. Searching for. Traces of. What we were. A ghost of you. is all that I have left. is all that I have left of you to hold.

harlow's song (i can't dream without you),"I can't dream without you?. When you close your eyes and go to sleep tonight. I'll be right outside your door. Dreams will come and they?ll take you away. Let them bring you back to me. And tomorrow when you wake, I'll be next to you. Full protection from the day. When the tears fall down your face like morning dull. I'll be there to put a smile on your face. And I?ll say. Chorus:. I don't wanna live this life without you. I don't wanna spend the night without you. I don't wanna know what it's like. I can't dream without you (2x). Let your fire burn bright for the world to see. You are the better part of me. When you hold my hand I swear that I believe. I'm living in my wildest dreams. And I say. I don't wanna live this life without you. I don't wanna spend the night without you. I don't wanna know what it's like. Flowers for your hair, rainbows for your eyes to see. Your dreams are everywhere. To carry you away from me. Away from me, someday (2x). I don't wanna live this life without you. I don't wanna spend the night without you. I don't wanna know what it's like. I don't wanna live this life without you. I don't wanna spend the night without you. I don't wanna know what it's like"
hey dad,"Hey Dad where have you been for so long?. Why won't you look at me?. Is there something wrong?. Do you remember me, the son that you conceived?. Why won't you look at me?. The son that you deceived. Oh God, what did I do to deserve this?. A man I never knew. A man I cannot miss. How can we start all over when we never began?. How can you be a father,. When you're not even a man?. I gave you many chances, many that you took. Now I stand before you,. You won't even look. So then came kids of my own. I was there for them. I am the man you couldn't be. (I didn't learn from him). Where is he now I don't even know at all. I don't even remember,. The last time he called"

I'm peacing it together, then I see a picture of me and you,. From:. (Chorus). And did I get a chance to say. That I wanted you, to stay. There's things I can't explain.

prayers,Born alone on a lonely planet. Full of broken dreams. Where no one understands me. When I finally met an angel. I didn't know what to say. She just held my hand. And we would lay awake at night. Looking at the stars. Thinking of the ones we've lost. And wonder where they are. When we lit another candle. She asked me who's to blame. Then she put her arms around me. And held me to the flame. So why do we hurt each other. We don't hear the words from one another's. Prayers. They don't mean a thing at all. Do they answer when you call. These prayers. When you don't mean what you say. Would you die for me today. Now I just can't relate. None of this makes sense. In this reality. God just leaves the room when I turn on my TV. I see a little girl who's crying because she lost her family. All these strangers sending thoughts and prayers. She's buried underneath. Why do we kill each other. We can't feel the pain in one another's. Prayers. They don't mean a thing at all. Do they answer when you call. These prayers. When you don't mean what you say. Would you die for me today. Now I just can't relate. We're so far away from one another. We keep building walls between each other's. Prayers. They don't mean a thing at all.

I don't ever wanna be you. Don't wanna be just like you. What I'm sayin' is. This is the anthem. Throw all your hands up. You, don't wanna be you. Go to college. A university. Get a real job. That's what they said to me. But I could never live the way they want. I'm gonna get by. And just do my time. At a stepwall. They yell get in line. I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind. Do you really want to be like them?. Do you really wanna be another trend?. Do you wanna be part of the crowd?. Cause I don't ever wanna. I don't ever wanna be you. Don't wanna be just like you. What I'm sayin' is. This is the anthem. Throw all your hands up. You, don't wanna be you. Shake it once that's fine. Shake it twice that's ok. Shake it 3 times you're playing with yourself again. You, don't wanna be just like you (what I'm sayin' is). This is the anthem. Throw all your hands up. Y'all got to feel me. Sing if you're with me. You, don't wanna be just like you (just like you). This is the anthem. Throw all your hands up. Y'all got to feel me. Sing if you're with me. Another loser anthem (whoa). Another loser anthem (whoa). Another loser anthem (whoa).

walk away (maybe),I made this bed. I choose to lie in it. Live with my regrets. Sleep with what I said. Could this be the end. I'm standing on the edge. Of everything I wanted now….. But I was afraid. But I was afraid. Maybe I’m just scared. To face the things I fear. It’s easier to walk away from everything. Separate my soul. With all the things we shared. I’m falling to pieces now. Say a prayer for me (say a prayer for me). When you go to bed. I’m in need of your faith now. But I was afraid. And maybe I’m just scared. To face the things I fear. It’s easier to walk away from everything. If we could just re-set. And live in happiness. Instead of our regrets. We would salvage everything. We don´t have to walk away. Pray for me now. I’m in need of faith. Pray for me now. I’m in need. Maybe I’m just scared. To face the things I feared. It’s easier to walk away from everything. If we could just reset. And live in happiness. Instead of our regrets. We´d salvage feared. Maybe I’m just scared. To face the things I failed. It’s easier to walk away from everything. Walk away from fear. Walk away from fear..

where would we be now?,"I smile, you laugh, I look away. I sigh, you ask me why, I say,. It's ok and I am just feeling down. Your hand on mine I hear the words.... If only love had found us first, our lives they would be different,. oooh. . So I stand and wait. I am just a man. oooh. Where would we be now baby, if we found each other first. Where would we be now baby. And now I must confess. That I am a sinking ship. And i'm anchored by the weight of my heart cause it's filled with these feelings. But I keep my true thoughts locked inside my hearts black box. And it wont be found, it wont survive, through the smoke of the wreckage. So I crash and burn. I got a lot of things to learn.

wounded,Lost and broken. Hopeless and lonely. Smiling on the outside. Hurt beneath my skin. My eyes are fading. My soul is bleeding. I'll try to make it seem ok. But my faith is wearing thin. So help me heal these wounds. They've been open for way too long. Help me fill this soul. Even though this is not your fault. That I'm open and I'm bleeding. All over your brand new rug. And I need someone to help me sow them up. I only wanted a magazine. I only wanted a movie screen. I only wanted the life I'd read about and dreamed. And now my mind is an open book. And now my heart is an open wound. And now my life is open. It's open for all to see. But help me heal these wounds. They've been open for way too long. Help me fill this soul. Even though this is not your fault. That I'm open and I'm bleeding. All over your brand new rug. And I need someone to help me. So you come along. I push you away. Then kick and scream for you to stay. 'Cause I need someone to help me. I need someone to help me. To help me heal these wounds. They've been open for way too long. Help me fill this soul. Even though this is not your fault. That I'm open and I'm bleeding. All over your brand new rug. And I need someone to help me sow them. I need someone to help me fill them. I need someone to help me close them up
you're gone,"You were young, you were bright, you were beautiful. You were everything anyone could want from a child. You were not supposed to leave this world that way. You were not supposed to leave this world that day. You would scribble down the lyrics of your favorite song. On your notebook in school when your days were long. And it meant so much for me to know. That you meant so much you'll never know. You're gone. And we all miss you. Listen to these songs. You're alive in every one. Are you smiling down?. Are you still singing?. Were you with us all along?. Do you like what we've become?. Did I meet you in the crowd at one of our shows?. Did I see you in the faces that all come and go?. Did I ever take the time, to just say thanks?. Was I too caught up in my life, to ask you your name?. The truth about this life is that we're all in it. together. That's what you said to me in all your pictures and your letters. Somehow I believe, that you have made me better. In my heart I know, you're gonna live forever. You're gone. And we all miss you. Listen to these songs. You're alive in every one. Are you smiling down?. Are you still singing?. Were you with us all along?. Do you like what we've become?. Are you smiling down?. Are you still singing?. Everyday that passes by. We celebrate your life. Can you hear us now?. But you were singing. Every song that's in our lives. I know we'll never be apart... (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh )"
your house,"When you're on, I swear. You're on. I think the whole room can hear me clear my throat. Then out of nowhere you put me right back there. We know what happens when we get to your house. You're winning me over with everything you say. When I let you closer,. I only want you closer. You rip my heart right out. I throw away everything I've written you. Anything. Just keep my mind off it. Thinking how I had you once. No, I can't forget that. Sometimes I wish I could lose you again. If you still care at all don't go tell me now. If you love me at all please don't tell me now. If you love me at all. Don't call"
