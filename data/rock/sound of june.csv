I actually despise you. You just so full of fear. Oh, just a senseless fool. But will you say again?. You grasp your disease. It's a circle of facts. That makes you worthless shit. Although your not that nice. I do respect one thing. you are a crying brat. you just lack your redeem. Oh, what is wrong with you. You are the Immature here. I'm telling the truth. Obviate me or flee. Uhh Yeah yeah yeah. yeah yeah yeah"

trouble maker,Hey your trouble maker. You're doing such a mess. You live on the chaos. Just a little riot in your head. I'm gonna put you down. Hey your trouble maker. You're doing such a mess. You live on the chaos. Just a little riot in your head. I'm gonna put you down. In my side you never been so far. The first to leave but the last to find. look like you never been there. The trouble man makes you blind. Cause all you ever had. Was stuck on the past. And the things you sang to me. Now seems so sad. I'm gonna put you down. But you can forget the things. But you can make a change. And you can take the right way
