come thou fount of every blessing,"Come thou fount of every blessing. Tune my heart to sing Thy grace. Streams of mercy, never ceasing. Call for songs of loudest praise. Teach me some melodious sonnet. Sung by flaming tongues above. Praise His name! I'm fixed upon it. Name of God's redeeming love. O to grace how great a debtor. Daily I'm constrained to be. Let Thy goodness like a fetter. Bind my wandering heart to Thee. Prone to wander Lord, I feel it. Prone to leave the God I love. Here's my heart, O take and seal it. Seal it for Thy courts above. Here's my heart, O take and seal it. Seal it for Thy courts above"
i want to fall in love with you,"In open fields of wild flowers,. she breathes the air and flies away. She thanks her Jesus for the daises and the roses. in no simple language. Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all. He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens. As close a heartbeat or a song on her lips. Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him. Someday He'll call her and she will come running. and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray,. I want to fall in love with You 4x. Sitting silent wearing Sunday best. The sermon echoes through the walls. A great salvation through it calls to the people. who stare into nowhere, and can't feel the chains on their souls. He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens. As close a heartbeat or a song on our lips. Someday we'll trust Him and learn how to see Him. Someday He'll call us and we will come running. and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and we'll pray,. I want to fall in love with You 4x. It seems too easy to call you Savior,. Not close enough to call you God. So as I sit and think of words I can mention. to show my devotion. I want to fall in love with You 4x. My heart beats for You"
fall asleep,"We wandered off like children in the woods. And let the searchers come but never find us. Tried to make a life among the trees. While your dreams collected planes. And cars and cities. You slipped away from me while I was sleeping. To climb the tallest oak and see the lights. Your dissatisfaction gave you questions. Do you remember what the city sounded like?. Do you remember what the city sounded like?. So stay up with me, don't fall asleep. Because we only have this moment. Once in our lives. And next time we'll meet under city lights. We're here tonight. So let's make it all it was meant to be. So I held you but the call was from inside. And I knew I couldn't keep you if I tried. But I watched as the distance spread. As the shadows grew. And the longings. Came like wolves to devour you. So stay up with me, don't fall asleep. Because we only have this moment. Once in our lives. And next time we'll meet under city lights. We're here tonight. So let's make it all it was meant to be. So stay up with me, don't fall asleep. Because we only have this moment. Once in our lives. And next time we'll meet under city lights. We're here tonight. So stay up with me, don't fall asleep. Because we only have this moment. Once in our lives. And next time we'll meet under city lights. But we're here tonight. So let's make it all it was meant to be. Let's make it all it was meant to be. Let's make it all it was meant to be"
nothing but the blood,"NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD. What can wash away my sin. What can make me whole again. For my pardon this I see. For my cleansing this my plea. Oh, precious is the flow.

amazing grace,"I grew this heart into a drifter. I never felt the roots I bare. I sold my sight, oh brother, sister. For a mountain of fool's gold, it's gone. Only God Knows, God knows where. My soul was restless for redemption. My feet were lookin' for a place to stand. Well I ain't got no life. And you know I ain't got no money. Just the faith of an empty hand. Amazing Grace I feel you coming up slowly now. Like the sun is risin', heat on my face. Oh love that keeps on shinin', don't let the shadow come. Ya know I gotta feel your healin' rays. I hitched a ride, I was a beggar. I had murder on my hands. I needed water to rinse these stains. But only blood could remove what's spillin'. And pardon me the blame.

With the light of Jesus' face. And I will not be ashamed,. For my Savior knows my name. It don't matter where you bury me,. I'll be home and I'll be free. It don't matter where I lay,. All my tears be washed away.. Gold and silver blind the eye,. Temporary riches lie. Come and eat from heaven's store,. Come and drink and thirst no more. It don't matter where you bury me,. I'l be home and I'll be free. It don't matter where I lay,. All my tears be washed away. So weep not for me my friends,. When my time below does end. For my life belongs to Him,. Who will raise the dead again.. It don't matter where you bury me,. 'Cause I'll be home and I'll be free.. It don't matter where I lay,. All my tears be washed away. Oooh, it don't matter......

be thou my vision,"Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart. Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art. Thou my best thought by day or by night. Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light. Be thou my wisdom and Thou my true word. I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord. Thou my great Father, I , Thy true son. Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one. Riches I heed not nor man's emptly praise. Thou mine inheritance now and always. Thou and thou only first in my heart. High King of heaven my treasure Thou are. High King of heaven my victory won.

art in me,"Images on the sidewalk speak of dream's decent. Washed away by storms to graves of cynical lament. Dirty canvases to call my own. Protest limericks carved by the old pay phone. In your picture book I'm trying hard to see. Turning endless pages of this tragedy. Sculpting every move you compose a symphony. You plead to everyone, ""see the art in me"". Broken stained-glass windows, the fragments ramble on. Tales of broken souls, an eternity's been won. As critics scorn the thoughts and works of mortal man. My eyes are drawn to you in awe once again. In your picture book I'm trying hard to see. Turning endless pages of this tragedy. Sculpting every move you compose a symphony. You plead to everyone, ""see the art in me""."
blind,"Cynical, just your way. You play the doubting Thomas. Feel the scars and wipe the stains. So you fight, and retreat. And talk yourself out of believing. in any peace that you can't see. Blind words you call. Blind words will fall. You're logical, you can't find. any reason to believe in love. you are blind. Crucify, and deny, pass the blame and burn the mission. Till dust remains and wash your hands. Blind words you call. Blind words will fall."

body and wine,"Rusty ground and dusty roads. It's been a while since you were king. Undermined and overthrown. You tried to run it on your own. Forget the birds with broken wings. Under piles of things on things. No one stops and no one stares. Seen it all and no one cares. What if this was all that we were made of?. This was all that we could make of love. If there wasn't more, I wouldn't be here. Hero and crime, body and wine. Drove my heart toward the sea. Passed the graves up over hills. Saw the spires hit the ground. Voices raised without a sound. What if this was all that we were made of?. This was all that we could make of love. If there wasn't more, I wouldn't be here. Hero and crime, body and wine. Hero and crime, body and wine.

can't erase it,"Follow the crowd and love everybody now. 'Cause love is the best thing for you now. But you changed your mind, you let everybody down. But down is the best place for you. It's easier that way, you know it's. So wrong, can't embrace it. wish sometimes for any other you. But you can't erase it, and you won't escape it. Don't waste your time. Your words only confine you. To all of the things you've buried now. Don't ask them why. Their wisdom will leave you blind. But blind is the best thing for you. It's easier I know, you know it's. So wrong, can't embrace it. Wish sometimes for any other you. But you can't erase it, and you won't escape it. How long will you face it. Till the weight comes crashing down on you. 'Cause you can't erase it, and you won't escape it."
frail,Convinced of my deception. I've always been a fool. I fear this love reaction. Just like you said I would. A rose could never lie. About the love it brings. And I could never promise. To be any of those things. Chorus:. If I was not so weak. If I was not so cold. If I was not so scared of being broken. Growing old. I would be.... I would be.... I would be.... Blessed are the shallow. Depth they'll never find. Seemed to be some comfort. In rooms I try to hide. Exposed beyond the shadows. You take the cup from me. Your dirt removes my blindness. Your pain becomes my peace. [Chorus]. ...frail.
like a child,"Dear God,. surround me as I speak,. the bridges that I walk accross. are weak. Frustrations fill the void that. I can't solely bear.. Dear God,. don't let me fall apart. you've held me close to you. I have turned away and searched. for answers. I can't understand.. They say that I can move the. mountains. And send them falling to the sea. They say that I can walk on water. If I would follow and believe. with Faith Like a Child. Sometimes,. when I feel miles away. and my eyes can't see your face. I wonder if I've grown to. lose the. recklessness I walked. in light of you. They say that love can. heal the broken. They say that hope can. make you see. They say that faith can find. a Savior. If you would follow and believe. With Faith Like a Child."
crazy times,"You're caught that way. And that's why you say,. The things that you say.. You can't attract. The things that you lack.. You're trying in vain.. It seems it's always the crazy times. You'll find you'll wake up and realize. It takes more than your saline eyes. To make things right.. You spiral down.. You've broken your crown.. You don't feel like a queen.. You've seen the proof. But you're still crying wolf.. You'll never believe!. It seems it's always the crazy times. You'll find you'll wake up and realize. It takes more than your saline eyes. To make things right.. You try climb a broken ladder. Gripped the missing rungs. And fall down down down down.. Seems some time ago you said it:. ""It's for the last and now you're sittin' here cryin'."" (yeah). Beside your bed. You're feeling for dead. You kneel in the dark.. It takes more than your saline eyes. To make things right.. It seems it's always the crazy times. You'll find you'll wake up and realize. It takes more than your saline eyes. To make things right.."
i'm in the way,you sit and stare out at the sky. and think of ways to fake a smile. but life is never what it seems. sometimes it only takes a while.

let us love and sing and wonder,LET US LOVE AND SING AND WONDER. Let us love and sing and wonder. Let us praise the Savior's name. He has hushed the law's loud thunder. He has quenched Mt. Sinai's flame. Let us love the Lord who bought us. Pitied us when enemies. Called us by His grace and taught us. Gave us ears and gave us eyes. He has washed us with His blood. He has washed us with His blood. He has washed us with His blood. He presents our souls to God. Let us wonder grace and justice. Join and point to mercy's store. When through grace in Christ our trust is. Justice smiles and asks no more. He who washed us with his blood. He who washed us with his blood. He who washed us with his blood. Has secured our way to God. Let us praise and join the chorus. Of the saints enthroned on high. Here they trusted him before us. Now their praises fill the sky. He has washed us with his blood. He has washed us with his blood. He has washed us with his blood. He has washed us with his blood. He will bring us home to God

To a land on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away. When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away. Like a bird from these prison walls, I'll fly away. I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away. When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away. Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I'll fly away. No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I'll fly away. I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.

And it's not that far. It's too far to walk. But you don't have to run. You'll get there in time. Get there in time. In time, to wonder where the days have gone. In time, to be old enough to wish that you were young. When good things are unraveling, bad things come undone. You weather love and lose your innocence. There will be liars and thieves who take from you. Not to undermine the consequence. But you are not what you do. And when you need it most. I have a hundred reasons why I love you. If you weather love and lose your innocence. Just remember - lesson one"
call my name,I’ll go when you call me. I’ll run when you tell me where to go. We are desert walkers under shaded clouds. Your fire shows there’s more of you to know. Let our idols fail. Vanity subside. We will see the beauty in our lives. When I hear you call my name. When I hear you call my name. Send me to the edge of the earth. Show me what a life is worth. When I hear you call my name. I will wait in the darkest hours. For you will be a light on this road. Lead me out to the ground I’ve never walked on. Only to rely on you alone. This is my Father’s world. And to my listening ear. My heart is still at home. When I hear you call my name
can't erase it,"Follow the crowd and love everybody now. 'Cause love is the best thing for you now. But you changed your mind, you let everybody down. But down is the best place for you. It's easier that way, you know it's. So wrong, can't embrace it. wish sometimes for any other you. But you can't erase it, and you won't escape it. Don't waste your time. Your words only confine you. To all of the things you've buried now. Don't ask them why. Their wisdom will leave you blind. But blind is the best thing for you. It's easier I know, you know it's. So wrong, can't embrace it. Wish sometimes for any other you. But you can't erase it, and you won't escape it. How long will you face it. Till the weight comes crashing down on you. 'Cause you can't erase it, and you won't escape it."

Well, love is fire and the coals are barely burning. Cold fills the emptiness that fills this empty place. I taught you the walk but then you ran away from me. And that's not how it's supposed to be. I, I collide with love as an elusive state of mind. I know there's something else it's supposed to be. I, I collide with love as an elusive state of mind. Something's killing me!.

Flowers through asphalt, diamonds in the pockets of your eyes,. You turn your face and hide.. I saw a woman with ribbons in her hair,. Old and lonely...so beautiful I had to stop and stare,.

The storm is wild enough for sailing. The bridge is weak enough to cross. This body frail enough for fighting. I'm home enough to know I'm lost. Home enough to know I'm lost. It's just enough to be strong. In the broken places, in the broken places. It's just enough to be strong. Should the world rely on faith tonight. The land unfit enough for planting.

fall asleep,"We wandered off like children in the woods. And let the searchers come but never find us. Tried to make a life among the trees. While your dreams collected planes. And cars and cities. You slipped away from me while I was sleeping. To climb the tallest oak and see the lights. Your dissatisfaction gave you questions. Do you remember what the city sounded like?. Do you remember what the city sounded like?. So stay up with me, don't fall asleep. Because we only have this moment. Once in our lives. And next time we'll meet under city lights. We're here tonight. So let's make it all it was meant to be. So I held you but the call was from inside. And I knew I couldn't keep you if I tried. But I watched as the distance spread. As the shadows grew. And the longings. Came like wolves to devour you. So stay up with me, don't fall asleep. Because we only have this moment. Once in our lives. And next time we'll meet under city lights. We're here tonight. So let's make it all it was meant to be. So stay up with me, don't fall asleep. Because we only have this moment. Once in our lives. And next time we'll meet under city lights. We're here tonight. So stay up with me, don't fall asleep. Because we only have this moment. Once in our lives. And next time we'll meet under city lights.

famous last words,"You say you heard every word, but I watched you turn away. Your eyes grew colder than winter. ""Love is so intrusive,"" I thought I heard you say. And laugh so unconvincingly. Famous last words, ""I'm not ready yet"". ""I won't be gone a minute"". Narrow is the road and too high a price to pay. When loneliness is such a sanctuary. Empty are the musings and wasted are the days. When you say you were only waiting. And famous last words, ""I'm not ready yet"". ""I won't be gone a minute"" and I won't forget. Famous last words. If tomorrow never comes, will I ever know that I was in love?. I was in love. In love. You say you heard every word, I watched you turn away. You were only waiting. And famous last words, ""I'm not ready yet"". ""I won't be gone a minute"" and I won't forget. Famous last words. If tomorrow never comes, will I ever know that I was in love?. And famous last words, ""I'm not ready yet"". ""I won't be gone a minute""."
five candles (you were there),"A promise or a dare. I would jump if I knew you'd catch me. Staring over the edge. I can't tell if you'll be here for me. I close my eyes and make a wish. Turn out the lights and take a breath. Pray that when the wick is burned. You would say that it's all about love. Chorus:. You were there when I needed you. You were there when the skies broke wide, wide open. You were there when I needed you. You were there when the skies broke wide, wide open. You were never here. I remember you said. Love was more than your good intentions. Empty boxes on the floor. Things I never asked you for. I pray that when the wick is burned. You would say that it's all about love. [Chorus]. I can't see the promise of. Excuses you fall upon. I pray to God not holding on. To things you've left undone. [Chorus x 2]. You were there when I. You were there when I. You were there when I needed you."
flood,"Rain rain on my face. It hasn't stopped raining for days. My world is a flood. Slowly I become one with the mud. But if I can't swim after forty days.

Lift me up so high that I cannot fall. Lift me up,. Lift me up - When I'm falling. Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying. Lift me up - I need you to hold me. Lift me up - Keep me from drowning again.

fly farther,"He picked her up some flowers. On a sunday afternoon. They sat out on the porch swing. Underneath the cresent moon. Life times seemed to pass. Staring at the skies. And on the swing he gave her the ring. There were tears in her eyes. He said I pray I'm not alone. In my dreams about forever. You and I could become one. And always be together. We'd grow old and wise. Through all the days. For worse or for better. And now the truth cause I love you. Even now more than ever. And a lifetime flies but we'll fly farthur. Into the night where the eyes of loneliness can never bother. All our dreams of together uneclipsed by never never. Lifetime finds it's in your eyes, but we'll fly farther. Fifty years have ridden off into the sunset. And the tears that we have cried have overflown. Here we are acounting scars, wounds of life and ending upsets. Your with me and I'm with you and I will never forget. Lifetime flies but we'll fly farther. Into the night where the eyes of loneliness will never bother. All our dreams of together uneclipsed by never never. Lifetime finds it's in your eyes, but we'll fly farther. He picked her up some flowers. On a sunday acfternoon. He rode the Grayhound bus past the house they used to swoon. He knelt beside the grave, hung his head, a teardrop fell. And on the stone the epitaph shone the words he knew so well.... Lifetime flies but we'll fly farther. Into the night where the eyes of loneliness will never bother. All our dreams of together uneclipsed by never never.

forgive me,"Well, I tried to figure out all the mysteries of love. I made confessions under pure duress. I thought that everything was meaningless. As far as the eye could see. As deep as the heart could be. Such an impossibility that you would forgive me. Forgive me. I wasted another year, waiting for the words. For things to be more clear. And now I'm so afraid, if I find the words to say. Have I lost you anyway?. For every town there is a crier. Like a thief in every choir. And when I think of the mistakes I've made. All my transgressions on a big parade. As far as the eye can see. As deep as the heart can be. Such an impossibility that you would forgive me. Forgive me. I wasted another year, waiting for the words. For something to be more clear. And now I'm so afraid, if I find the words to say. Have I lost you anyway?. As far as the eye can see. As deep as the heart can be. Such an impossibility that you would forgive me. I wasted another year, waiting for the words. For something to be more clear. But now I am afraid, if I find the words to say. Have I lost you anyway?. 'Cause I've found the words to say. I've been thinking them for days. And now I'm begging you to stay"

frail,Convinced of my deception. I've always been a fool. I fear this love reaction. Just like you said I would. A rose could never lie. About the love it brings. And I could never promise. To be any of those things. Chorus:. If I was not so weak. If I was not so cold. If I was not so scared of being broken. Growing old. I would be.... I would be.... I would be.... Blessed are the shallow. Depth they'll never find. Seemed to be some comfort. In rooms I try to hide. Exposed beyond the shadows. You take the cup from me. Your dirt removes my blindness. Your pain becomes my peace. [Chorus]. ...frail.

ghost in the moon,Ghost in the moon. Walking alone. All this dark on the streets. Not every man has his day. Every dog gets its bone. Had a heart of a kin. Nothing I touch turn to gold.

god be merciful to me (psalm 51),"God be merciful to me on Thy grace,. I rest my plea. Plenteous in compassion Thou. Blot out my transgressions now. Wash me, make me pure within. Cleanse, oh, cleanse me from my sin. My transgressions I confess. Grief and guilt my soul oppress. I have sinned against Thy grace. And provoked Thee to Thy face. I confess Thy judgment just. Speechless, I, Thy mercy trust. I am evil born in sin. Thou desirest truth within. Thou alone my Savior art. Teach Thy wisdom to my heart. Make me pure, Thy grace bestow. Wash me whiter than the snow. Gracious God, my heart renew. Make my spirit right and true. Thy salvation's joy impart. Steadfast make my willing heart. Steadfast make my willing heart. Broken, humbled to the dust. By Thy wrath and judgment just. Let my contrite heart rejoice. And in gladness hear Thy voice. From my sins, oh, hide Thy face. Blot them out in boundless grace"

A blessing from above. You've been God-sent to me. You're the Godsend. I've been dreaming of. You're a Godsend. Holding your hand, touching your face. I will love you now and always I swear. I will never forget that first moment we met. When two worlds collided and I found my best friend. (repeat chorus). (bridge). I was made for you, you were made for me. In this lonely world, we were meant to be in love. I will never forget that first moment we met. When two worlds they crashed in. And I found my best friend. (repeat chorus)"
good monsters,"All the good monsters open their eyes,. To see the wasteland where the home fires rise,. And the people shouting why, why, why.... Do you know what you are?. Do you know what you are?. All of the giants wake from their sleep,. And roll outside of safety's keep,. And the pain makes them feel so alive. Do you know what you are?. Do you know what you are?. And we are bored of all the things we know. Do you know what you are?. Do you know what you are?. Not all monsters are bad, but the ones who are good. Never do what they could, never do what they could. All the good monsters rattle their chains,. And dance around the open flames,. And they make a lot of empty noise.. While all of the bright eyes turn away,. As if there wasn't anything to say,. About the justice and the mystery.. Do you know what you are?. Do you know what you are?. And we are bored of all the things we know. And we are forms of everything we love, we love.. If good won't show it's ugly face,. Evil won't you take your place. Nothing ever changes,. Nothing ever changes.... By itself.. Yeah....yeah...aaah. We are bored of all the things we know. Do you know what you are. 'Cause we are, we are so in love with ourselves. And we are forms of all the things we love."
"goodbye, goodnight","A flower for your vanity, a penny for your thoughts. About the world's insanity and how we've gotten lost. Strike up the band to play a song as we go waltzing by. And fake a smile as we all say goodbye. Goodbye, oh goodbye. Say a prayer for recognition, kiss the ones you love. Gather up the ammunition, sigh for all the lost. Strike up the band to play a song as we go waltzing by. And fake a smile as we all say goodbye. Raise a glass for ignorance, drink a toast to fear. The beginning of the end has come that's why we all are here. Strike up the band to play a song and try hard not to cry. And fake a smile as we all say goodbye. Goodbye."
grace,"God, I admit I haven't changed. Playing card houses still covering my landscape. I never expected You to stay. When I'm grabbing for these crumbs and cold loose change. I feel Your grace come running over every road. I love the way You're calling overflow. I feel Your grace come running over every road. You break the floodgates down and carry all. God, I admit that I've loved these chains. And crawling around this cage sometimes has its advantages. I know someday this could get old. And I'll need Your healing water to find my home."
hand,"I'm here waiting for something new to break my heart. So callous laden, I can't feel a thing at all. Will You catch my fall?. From lost and not found, to run and not hide. My hand inside... (Your hand). Losing my grip falling so far. My hand inside Your hand. Fear is keeping time with the beating of my heart. Doin' way too much thinkin'. And it's tearing me apart. But I, I feel You reach for me. From lost and not found, to run and not hide. My hand inside... (Your hand). Losing my grip falling so far. My hand inside Your hand. I hear Your voice and follow. So hard to believe, and still I go"
he,"Don't try to reach me, I'm already dead. The pain when it grips me, for things that I've done. Well I try to make you proud, but for crying out loud. Just give me a chance to hide away. Exhaustion takes over, will this someday be over?. Chorus:. Fearful tears are running down. The pain you've laid don't speak a sound. Don't take my heart away from me. And they think I fell down. Daddy, don't you love me?. Then why do you hit me?. And Momma don't you love me. Then why do you hurt me?. Well I try to make you proud, but for crying out loud. Just give me a chance to hide away. Exhaustion takes over, will this someday be over?. [Chorus]. A teardrop falls from up in the heavens. Drowning the sorrow of angels on high. For the least of the helpless, the hopeless, the loveless. My Jesus, His children, He holds in His eyes."
headphones,"I don't have to hear it, if I don't want to. I can drown this out, pull the curtains down on you. It's a heavy world, it's too much for me to care. If I close my eyes, it's not there. With my headphones on, with my headphones on. With my headphones on, with my headphones on. We watch television...but the sound is something else. Just a song played against the drama, so the hurt is never felt. I take in the war-fires, and I'm chilled by the current events. It's so hopeless, but there's a pop song in my. Headphones on, in my headphones on. With my headphones on, with my headphones on. At the Tube Stop, you sit down across from me. (I can see you looking back at me). I think I know you. By the sad eyes that I see. I want to tell you (It's a heavy world). Everything will be okay. You wouldn't hear it (I don't want to have to hear it). So we go our separate ways.... With our headphones on, with our headphones on. With our headphones on, with our headphones on. I don't wanna be the one who tries to figure it out. I don't need another reason I should care about you. You don't want to know my story. You don't want to own my pain. Living in a heavy, heavy world. And there's a pop song in my head. I don't want to have to hear it"

heaven,"Go undercover, we drop from the screens. We're hunters and lions, we are submarines. Under the surface, slip through the wires. Decipher the code words, disable the liars. And find, glowing on the inside. What's growing on the inside. Heaven's not that far. Glowing on the inside. Showing on the inside. It's growing where we are. We shatter devices, exit the stage. We stop masquerading, to rattle the cage. We face every searchlight at places we hide. We dress up for Eden, the gates open wide. We are, we are, we are. We're hunters and lions. We go undercover, we cover, we cover"
hero,"One spot on an empty canvas. One chair in an empty room. No place for a revolution. No hope if the signs are true. We stand at the edge of something. Will we ever know what it is. Hold on 'cause the wind is rising. And we can't get away from it. We're in shock from the failed emotion. No cause in a shadow land. We sing while the city's burning. No room, no escape, no plan. We all never thought it would end this way. And we need a hero. To save us from ourselves. We need a hero. To save us from ourselves. Save us from ourselves. Save us from our fear. When the sirens wail, we need a hero here. We hide on our knees in silence. Maybe God doesn't hear at all. And the wait overtakes the violence. And we watch as the giants fall. We're not gonna let it end this way"
hibernation day,"I don’t want to get out of bed,. You don’t want to go out in the snow,. We don’t have to do the things Eskimos do,. Let’s have a hibernation day, me and you.. The snow is climbing up the door, (so much higher than before). The weatherman is sure there will be more, (I don’t want to go out in the snow). These blankets make a cozy little cave just for two,. Let’s have a hibernation day.. I love the snap of winter air and the snowflakes on my face,. How thew snow drifts make the cars disappear without a trace,. I’ll take a day dressed in pyjamas, in a room without a view, if I can spend the day curled up next to you.. Next to you. (next to you). I don’t want to get out of bed,.

hiding place,"Amidst the sorrows of the way. Lord Jesus, teach my soul to pray. Let me taste Thy special grace. And run to Christ, my hiding place. You know the vileness of my heart. So prone to act the rebel’s part. And when You veil Your lovely face. How can I find a hiding place. Hiding place, hiding place. Lord, guide my wandering feet. Draw me to Thy mercy seat. I’ve nought to trust but sovereign grace. Thou only art my hiding place. How unstable is my heart. Sometimes I take the tempter’s part. And slight the tokens of Thy grace. And seem to want no hiding place. Hiding place, hiding place. But when Thy spirit shines within. Makes me feel the plague of sin. And how I long to see Thy face. ‘Tis then I want a hiding place. Lord Jesus, shine and then I can. Feel sweetness in salvation’s plan. And as a sinner plead for grace. Christ, the sinner’s hiding place. And as a sinner plead for grace. Christ, the sinner’s hiding place"
hymn,"Oh refuge of my hardened heart. Oh fast pursuing lover come. As angels dance 'round Your throne. My life by captured fare You own. Not silhouette of trodden faith. Nor death shall not my steps be guide. I'll pirouette upon mine grave. For in Your path I'll run and hide. Chorus:. Oh gaze of love so melt my pride. That I may in Your house but kneel. And in my brokenness to cry. Spring worship unto Thee. When beauty breaks the spell of pain. The bludgeoned heart shall burst in vain. But not when love be pointed king. And truth shall Thee forever reign. [Chorus]. Sweet Jesus carry me away. From cold of night, and dust of day. In ragged hour or salt worn eye. Be my desire, my well sprung lye. [Chorus x 2]. Spring worship unto Thee. Spring worship unto Thee."
i could sing of your love forever,Over the mountains and the sea. Your river runs with love for me. So I will open up my heart. And let the Healer set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth. And I will daily lift my hands. For I will always sing of. When Your love came down. I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever. And O I feel like dancing. It's foolishness I know. But when the world has seen the light. They will dance with joy. Like we're dancing now
i heard the bells on christmas day,"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day. Their old familiar carols play,. And wild and sweet the words repeat. Of peace on earth, good will to men.. I thought how, as the day had come,. The belfries of all Christendom. Had rolled along the unbroken song. Of peace on earth, good will to men.. And in despair I bowed my head:. \""There is no peace on earth,\"" I said,. \""For hate is strong and mocks the song. Of peace on earth, good will to men.\"". Of peace on earth, good will to men.. And in despair I bowed my head:. \""There is no peace on earth,\"" I said,. \""For hate is strong and mocks the song. Of peace on earth, good will to men.\"". Of peace on earth, good will to men. Of peace on earth, good will to men. Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:. \""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep;. The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,. With peace on earth, good will to men.\"". Till, ringing singing, on its way,. The world revolved from night to day,. A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,. Of peace on earth, good will to men!"

i need you,"Strangely out of place. There is a light filling this room where. None would follow before. I can’t deny it burns me up inside. I fan the flames to melt away my pride. Do I want shelter from the rain. Or the rain to wash me away. I need You, I need You, I need You. I need You, I need You, I need You. You’re all I’m living for. I might sound like a fool. But I think I felt You moving closer to me. Face to the ground to hide the fatal cut. I fight the weight, I feel You lift me up. You are the shelter from the rain. And the rain to wash me away. Face to the ground to hide the fatal cut. I fight the weight, I feel You lift me up. I can’t deny it burns me upside. I fan the flames to melt away my pride. Only have a second to spare. All the time in the world to know You’re there. You are the shelter from the rain. And the rain to wash me away."
i want to fall in love with you,"In open fields of wild flowers,. she breathes the air and flies away. She thanks her Jesus for the daises and the roses. in no simple language. Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all. He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens. As close a heartbeat or a song on her lips. Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him. Someday He'll call her and she will come running. and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray,. I want to fall in love with You 4x. Sitting silent wearing Sunday best. The sermon echoes through the walls. A great salvation through it calls to the people. who stare into nowhere, and can't feel the chains on their souls. He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens. As close a heartbeat or a song on our lips. Someday we'll trust Him and learn how to see Him. Someday He'll call us and we will come running. and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and we'll pray,. I want to fall in love with You 4x. It seems too easy to call you Savior,. Not close enough to call you God. So as I sit and think of words I can mention. to show my devotion. I want to fall in love with You 4x. My heart beats for You"
i'll fly away,"I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away. When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away. Some bright morning when this life is over, I'll fly away. To a land on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away. When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away. Like a bird from these prison walls, I'll fly away. I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away. When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away. Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I'll fly away. No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I'll fly away. I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away. When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away. Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away. To a land where joy will never end, I'll fly away. I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away. When I die, hallellujah by and by, I'll fly away"
i'm alright,"It was the fear of God that led me to you. And it's the fear of you that takes getting used to. I've never been one to hang my heart on a thread. But you spun me around and you loved me instead. I know I could turn to something other than you. 'Cause I don't understand you and why you're after me. I've never been the saint you wanted me to turn to. And I can't see the view from the eyes you look at me through, oh no. But I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright. I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright. So cut below the surface and try hard not to notice. That I could be so foolish thinkin' I'm alright. I've got no one to hold me, I've got no one to carry. Everything inside of me that I won't let you see."

if i stand,"There's more that rises in the morning than the sun. And more that shines in the night than just the moon. There's more than just this fire here that keeps me warm. In a shelter that is larger than this room. And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiments. And a music higher than the songs that I can sing. Stuff of Earth competes for the allegiance. I owe only to the Giver of all good things. So if I stand let me stand on the promise that you will pull me through. And if I can't, let me fall on the grace that first brought me to you. So if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs. And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home. And there's more that dances on the prairies than the wind. And more that pulses in the ocean than the tide. There's a love that's fiercer than the love between friends. More gentle than a mother's when her baby's at her side. And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiments. And a music higher than the songs that I can sing. The stuff of Earth competes for the allegence. I owe only to the Giver of all good things. So if I stand let me stand on the promise that You will pull me through. And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You. And if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs. And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home. So if I stand let me stand on the promise You will pull me through. And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You. And if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs. And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home."
in the bleak midwinter,"In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,. Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone,. Snow had fallen – snow on snow, snow on snow, on snow,. In the bleak midwinter, long ago.. What can I give him, poor as I am?. If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb,. If I were a wise man, I would do my part,. What I can I give him – give my heart..

lesser things,"It looks a lot like givin' up. Peace we bring is a bitter cup. Set our bodies down like offerings. While we pray to the god of the lesser things.

Is there grace for a wayward heart. Is there grace for a wayward heart. Grace, Grace. Ash to ash and dust to dust. Steel on steel or rain to rust. What mortal breath blood money brings. Forth from the altar of the lesser things. Is there grace for a wayward heart. Is there grace for a wayward heart. Is there grace, grace. Is there grace for a wayward heart. Is there grace for a wayward heart. Grace, Grace."

Love, Love Is The Protest. When You Rise, Do You See?. Love is The Protest. How You Fight, Let It Be. Love Is The Protest. Let Love Make Saints Out Of Hypocrites. Let Grace Fall From Broken Lips.

I Want Peace, But It's Not What I'm Used To. I Want Love, But It Hurts When It Gets Through. I'm Surrounded By People Who Don't Think Like I Do"
love me,"I built my wall. You walked right through it. I threw my stone. You leaned into it. You were the only one to show me hell. Rescued my soul, shattered my shell. You were the only spot not petrified. Said the right things at the right time. You love me, love me, love me. You love me, love me, love me, love me now. You light my fuse. I won’t blow it. And these games you use. Do you think I don’t know it?. You were the only one to show me hell. Rescued my soul, shattered my shell. You were the only spot not petrified.

You love me, love me, love me, love me now"
love song for a savior,"In open fields of wild flowers,. she breathes the air and flies away. She thanks her Jesus for the daisies and the roses. in no simple language. Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all. He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens. As close as a heartbeat or a song on her lips. Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him. Someday He'll call her and she will come running. and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray,. ""I want to fall in love with You"". Sitting silent wearing Sunday best. The sermon echoes through the walls. A great salvation through it calls to the people. who stare into nowhere, and can't feel the chains on their souls. He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens. As close as a heartbeat or a song on our lips. Someday we'll trust Him and learn how to see Him. Someday He'll call us and we will come running. and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and we'll pray,. ""I want to fall in love with You"". ""We want to pray..."". It seems too easy to call you ""Savior"",. Not close enough to call you ""God"". So as I sit and think of words I can mention. to show my devotion. ""I want to fall in love with You"". ""my heart beats for You""."
love won't let us,"I had a revelation, I had a good thought. I sold it for comfort now and look what I got. I pledged my allegiance and lied my way out. I'm climbing to Jesus on the breaks in the doubt. Breaks in the doubt. Love, it won't let us out of here. It won't let us out of here. My hands are too clean, and my head is a mess. But things are gonna get dirty when we confess. There's water in the river and love in the air. Gravity is shifting to lift off your care. To lift off your care. Love, it won't let us out of here. It won't let us out of here. Love, no, it won't let us out of here. It won't let us out of here alive. Love won't let us out of here alive. Love, it won't let us out of here.

mirrors & smoke,"I'm feeling older than my years, I'm feeling pain inside my chest.. You know it's love that keeps me silent, it's my silence you detest.. Rivers flow into the ocean, and oceans never fill,. I want to kiss your lips but I know I never will.. Love's a hard decision to risk impending choke,. So my love will keep you wishing,. and my heart will keep me broke.. I give you flowers, give you candy to even out the guilt.. I send you greeting cards with messages that I could never write.. Rivers flow into the oceans, and oceans never fill,. I want to let you know me, but I know I never will.. Love's a contradiction made of mirrors and smoke,. So my love will keep you wishing,. And my heart it makes me broke.. You will always want me, and I'll always want to leave.. Even though I cut your wounds, you still deny they're real.. Rivers flow into the oceans, and oceans never fill,. I want to lay my life down, but I know you never will.. Love's a strange condition with all the doubts it can invoke,. Your love keeps me wishing, and my heart it keeps me broke.. Baby, don't you cry 'cause I got it all figure out.. You'll always make me sad, but that's what true love is all about.. Rivers never fill the oceans, but oceans always feel.... The waters reaching deep inside them, I guess they always will.. Loves a constant mission, truer words were never spoke,. So my love will keep you wishin' and my heart will keep me broke.... ..keeps me wishing, my heart it makes me broke....mirrors and smoke."
much afraid,"Empty again. Sunken down so far. So scared to fall. I might not get up again. So I lay at your feet. All my brokenness. I carry all of my burdens to you. Chorus:. All of these things. I've held up in vain. No reason nor rhyme. Just the scars that remain. Of all of these things. I'm so much afraid. Scared out of my mind. By the demons I've made. Sweet Jesus, you never ever let me go. Oh, sweet Jesus, never ever let me go. So happy to love. Yet so far to go. You lead me on to where I've never been before. [Chorus]."

needful hands,"For those under the clouds. Staring up in awesome wonder. As tears come slowly down. I'm reaching up a needful hand. [Chorus:]. You are my eyes when I cannot see. You are my voice, see, sing through me. You are my strength in weakness be. To find that I could fall. And still your grace surrounds, pursuing. To freely stumble down. I feel your hands around my heart. [Chorus]. You are my strength, my voice, my eyes. I lift up needful hands. You are my strength, my voice, my eyes. I lift up needful hands. [Chorus]"
no greater love,"Is it life in vain. Are we ghosts rattling chains. When we get what we want. Are the problems still the same. ‘Cause my hands can’t heal. While I’m holding on so tight. And my heart won’t care enough. To pick a better fight. Show me the beauty of a life. Show me the beauty of a life. Show me the beauty of a life. No greater love, no greater love. And you say, there’s no greater love. Is it still my turn. I think I’m the last one left to learn. That the life I lose. Is the least of my concerns. Show me the beauty of a life. Show me the beauty of a life. Show me the beauty of a life. Laid down"

no one loves me like you,"Collapsing was much softer. Still falling always hurt. Only after sensing your love. For always ever burned. You justified my folly. My affluent disguise. Removed revealing nothing. Yet nothing unforgiven lies. Unforgiven lies. Chorus:. No one loves me like you. No one loves me the way you do. No one loves me like you. No one loves me the way, the way that you do. To touch the rose unfearful. Is to meet the thorn. And pierce the heart's emotion. And feel the emptiness no more. Emptiness no more. Chorus. Took some time to realize I've fallen. Chorus."
nothing but the blood,"NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD. What can wash away my sin. What can make me whole again. For my pardon this I see. For my cleansing this my plea. Oh, precious is the flow. That makes me white as snow. No other fount I know. Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus. Nothing can for sin atone. Not of good that I have done. This is all my hope and peace. This is all my righteousness. Oh, precious is the flow. That makes me white as snow. And no other fount I know. Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus. Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus. Now by this I'll overcome. Now by this I'll reach my home. Glory, glory, this I see. All my praise for this I bring. All my praise for this I bring.

oh my god,"Oh my God, look around this place,. Your fingers reach around the bone,. you set the break and set the tone. For flights of grace, and future falls. In present pain all fools say, ""Oh my God."". Oh my God, why are we so afraid?. We make it worse when we don't bleed,. There is no cure for our disease.. Turn a phrase and rise again,. Or fake your death and only tell your closest friends,. Oh My God.. Oh my God, can I complain?. You take away my firm belief and graft my soul upon your grief.. Weddings, boats, and alibis,. All drift away, and a mother cries.... Liars and fools, sons and failures, theives will always say... Lost and found, ailing wanderers, healers always say... Whores and angels, men with problems, leavers always say... Broken hearted, separated, orphans always say... War creators, racial haters, preachers always say... Distant fathers, fallen warriors, givers always say... Pilgrim saints, lonely widows, users always say... Fearful mothers, watchful doubters, Saviors always say... Sometimes I can not forgive. and these days mercy cuts so deep,. If the world was how it should be, maybe I could get some sleep.. While I lay, I'd dream we're better, scales were gone and faces lighter,. When we wake we hate our brother, we still move to hurt each other,. Sometimes I can close my eyes and all the fear the keeps me silent,. Falls below my heavy breathing, what makes me so badly bent?. We all have a chance to murder, we all have the need for wonder.. We still want to be reminded that the pain is worth the plunder.. Sometimes when I lose my grip, I wonder what to make of heaven,. All the times I thought to reach up, all the times I had to give up.. Babies underneath their beds, in hospitals that cannot treat them.. All the wounds that money causes, all the comforts of cathedrals,. All the cries of thirsty children, this is our inheritance,. All the rage of watching mothers, this is our greatest offense. Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God"
on jordan's stormy banks i stand,"On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand. And cast a wishful eye. To Canaan’s fair and happy land. Where my possessions lie. All o’er those wide extended plains. Shines one eternal day. There God, the Son forever reigns. And scatters night away.. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land. No chilling wind nor poisonous breath. Can reach that healthful shore. Where sickness, sorrow, pain and death. Are felt and feared no more. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land. When shall I see that happy place. And be forever blessed. When shall I see my Father’s face. And in His bosom rest. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land"
only alive,"I'm a fair weather friend. I'm a colorless view but I'm willin' to make a deal. If you think you can make some faith here inside. I'll drive off and marry you. I'm only alive with you. I can't get by and I won't get through. So put me in the river and let me say I do. I'm only alive with you. You're a sight for sore eyes and a newborn cry. In a year where there are so few. If you throw me a line, I'll show you in time. I'm fallin' in love with you. I'm only alive with you. I can't get by and I won't get through. So put me in the river and let me say I do. I'm only alive with you. Though my heart has been torn by loves I have worn. And I'm tempted by them ever still. I tremble inside when you walk in the room. You hold my affections and will. I'm only alive with you. I can't get by and I won't get through. So put me in the river and let me say I do. I'm only alive with you."
our lord is crucified,"O come and mourn with me awhile. O come near to the Savior’s side. O come together, let us mourn. Jesus our Lord is crucified. Seven times He spoke. Seven words of love. And all three hours His silence cried. For mercy on the souls of men. Jesus our Lord is crucified. O love of God, O sin of man. In this dread act your strength is tried. And victory remains with love. Jesus our Lord is crucified. O break, O break hard heart of mine. My weak self-love and guilty pride. His Pilate and His Judas were. Jesus our Lord is Crucified. O love of God, O sin of man. In this dread act your strength is tried. And victory remains with Love. Jesus our Lord is crucified. O come and mourn with awhile. A broken heart, a fount of tears.

And victory remains with love. Jesus our Lord is crucified. O love of God, O sin of man. In this dread act your strength is tried. And victory remains with love. Jesus our Lord is crucified"
out of my hands,"I wasted a rescue, abandoned the mission.. I failed by my own hand and watched it all go wrong.. You said You could save me, that I couldn?t save myself.. You said that You loved me, no matter what I?ve done.. When the light is gone and life is just a dare we take,. Still the fight goes on to give my heart away.. And it?s out of my hands. It was from the start,. In light of what You?ve done for me, in light of what You?ve done for me.. You lifted my head and set me apart,. In light of what You?ve done for me. This is what You?ve done for me.. It?s out of my hands."

portrait of an apology,"Look what I've done. This picture I've painted. It looks like my heart. Or what still remains. Convinced of the weight. Your interpretations. Are not what I see. I wish they could be. I remember it much redder. I remember it much brighter. Chorus:. Can you stay for a while. Try to imagine this. Could you be for a while. I can't remember it.

redemption,"We made it to a starnge town. Going down the wrong road. Like any story retold. Couldn't find a common ending. We're way gone, be gone, looking for our own way. We needed a distraction. You said you were redemption. We knew it as a wrong turn. We couldn't know the things we'd gain. When we reach the other border. We look out way down past the road we came from. We're looking for redemption. It was hidden in the landscape. Of loss and love and fire and rain. Never would have come this way. Looking for redemption. We were looking out past the road we came from. Looking at redemption. Hidden in the landscape. Of loss and love and fire and rain. Never would have come this way. Looking for redemption. In the eyes of sorrow, eyes of rage. What a sordid histories they played. The drama of redemption. Redemption."

We're just sitting like novels we've picked up but never read through. You think you know my ending, I think I know yours, too. You see, nowhere in these old conversations is there anything new. Even though we know the sun will rise. Every ray of light still takes us by, by surprise. Baby, leave it all behind. Baby, leave it all behind. Missed a road sign. I don't want to get home soon. Drive the car all the way around the moon. Baby, we could get lost. We have another state to cross. We could find each other out. Tell our secrets on the scenic route. I don't want to get home soon. Drive the car around the moon. I don't want to crush you or rush you. I'm not going faster if you want to and if you want to. I don't want to rush you or crush you.

I'm gonna speak with words that need no form. I'm gonna give you what you never had before. You're beautiful and I am weakened by the force of your eyes. So shine bright to separate the truth from the lies. I'm gonna show you love. I'm gonna show you love in every language. I'm gonna speak with words that need no form. I'm gonna give you what you never had before. So tie me to a tree and let the smoke and ash collect. No, I won't regret to let love do what love will let. We can drown in mixed emotions or walk across an angry sea. This is the cost of being free. I'm gonna show you love in every language. I'm gonna speak with words that need no form."

something beautiful,"If you put your arms around me,. Could it change the way i feel?. I guess I let myself believe. That the outside might just bleed its way in. Maybe stir the sleeping past. Lying under glass. Waiting for the kiss. That breaks this awful spell. Pull me out... of this lonely cell. Close my eyes and hold my heart. Cover me and make me something. Change this something normal. Cnto something beautiful. What I get from my reflection. Isn't what I thought i'd see.. Give me reason to believe. You'd never keep me incomplete. Will you untie this loss of mine?. It easily defines me,. Do you see it on my face?. That all i can think about is how long. I've been waiting to feel you move me.. Close my eyes and hold my heart. Cover me and make me something. Change this something normal. Into something beautiful. Into something beautiful. Into something beautiful. And I'm still fighting for the word. To break these chains. And I still pray when I look in your eyes. You'd stare right back down. Into something beautiful. So close my eyes and hold my heart. Cover me and make me something. Change this something normal. Into something beautiful. Into something beautiful. Into something beautiful."

I can't quite remember anyway. So if you're waitin' for love. Well it's a promise I'll keep. If you don't mind believing that it changes everything. Then time will never matter.

Then time will never matter. So if you're waitin' for love. It's a promise I'll keep. If you don't mind believing that it changes everything. Then time will never matter."
surprise,"Shoot a dream in your arm and sleep away,. It's not the stuff that kills you that keeps your life at bay.. Every crash pulls you in reach,. Of a watershed of signal flares that cover your beach,. These are just placebos to make us feel all right,. Illusions in our pockets make our feathers float us high,. For a second I thought I saw your eyelids rise,. For a moment something restless caught you by surprise,. Surprise, surprise, surprise.. We are so beautiful when we sleep,. Hearts of gold and eyes so.. deep, deep, deep.. But love won't cure the chaos, and hope won't hide the loss,. And peace is not the heroine that shouts above the cause.. And love is wild for reasons, and hope though short in sight,. Might be the only thing that wakes you by surprise. Surprise, surprise, surprise.. Dream, little ones... See the world that's just begun.. Love is wild for reasons, and hope though short in sight,. Might be the only thing that brings you back to life. for a moment I thought I saw your eyelids rise...... Surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise."

Waiting for the wind to rise. My soul is waiting. Looking for a place to hide. I need a little peace tonight. Take me higher than the sun. Yeah, you are the only one. Take me higher than the sun. Yeah, yeah. Around the ceiling of the heart. Is where we feel the things that send us away. To where the blind can see the stars. So do you see the stars. Do you see the stars.

tea and sympathy,"Fare thee well. Tradin' all our words for tea sympathy. Wonder why we tried, for things could never be. Play our hearts' lament like an unrehearsed symphony. Not intend. To leave this castle full of empty rooms. Our love the captive in the tower never rescued. And all our victory songs seem to be playing out of tune. 'Cause it's not the way that it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no. And it's not the way that it has to be. You begin. All your words fall to the floor and break like china cups. And a waitress grabs a broom and tries to sweep them up. I reach for my tea, slowly drink in. 'Cause it's not the way that it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no. And it's not the way. That it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy. Fare thee well. The words, the bag of leaves that fill my head. I could taste the biterness and call the waitress instead. 'Cause she holds the answer, smiles and asks one teaspoon or two. 'Cause it's not the way that it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no. And it's not the way that it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy. And it's not he way that it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no. 'Cause it's not the way that it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy. Don't trade us for tea and sympathy. Don't trade us for tea and sympathy. We can work it out. Don't trade us for tea and sympathy. Don't trade us for tea and sympathy. We can work it out. We can work it out."
the comforter has come,"O spread the tidings round,. Wherever a man is found,. Wherever human hearts and human woes abound,. Let every Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound;. The Comforter has come.. The long night has past,. The morning breaks at last,. And hushed the dreadful wail and fury of the blast,. As over the golden hills the day advances fast,. The Comforter has come.. The Comforter has come.. O boundless love divine. How shall this tongue of mine,. To wondering mortals tell the matchless grace divine,. That I, a child of hell, in His image shine,. The Comforter has come.. The Comforter has come.. The Comforter has come."

the valley song,"You have led me to the sadness. I have carried this pain. On a back bruised, nearly broken. I'm crying out to you. Chorus. I will sing of Your mercy. That leads me through valleys of sorrow. To rivers of joy. When death like a gypsy. Comes to steal what I love. I will still look to the heavens. I will still seek your face. But I fear you aren't listening. Because there are no words. Just the stillness and the hunger. For a faith that assures. Chorus. Alleluia, alleluia. Alleluia, alleluia. While we wait for rescue. With our eyes tightly shut. Face to the ground using our hands. To cover the fatal cut. Though the pain is an ocean. Tossing us around, around, around. You have calmed greater waters. Higher mountains have come down. Chorus. Alleluia, alleluia."
the widowing field,"Iâ€™m sure that I could never make it through a night without you here. The fire in the skies illuminates the demons closing in.. Have mercy on my soul if I am not the last,. Have mercy on my soul if I am not the last to go.. As I crawl along these trails and fight upon this widowing field.. The ground below is bare and burned in the places I have learned to trust you.. . Have mercy on my soul if I am not the last,. Have mercy on my soul if I am not the last to go. If I am not the last to go,. Believe in silence sets my heart to racing.. I will lift my eyes to you, please, Father, find me.. Have mercy on my soul if I am not the last,."

Are the wages for things you have done.. On all of those nights,. Spent alone in the darkness of your mind.. Give it up, Let go.. These are things you were never meant to shoulder,.

These are things you were never meant to shoulder.. Give it up, Let go.... There is a river that washes you clean. There is a tree that marks the places you've been. Blood that was spilled, although not your own. For all of these things, love will atone. I know the world can turn in different ways.. Most of the time we're simply hangin on.. But under the signs of how we all behave,. we might find the place where we belong.... There is a river that washes you clean. There is a tree that marks the places you've been. Blood that was spilled, although not your own. For all of these things, love will atone. For all of those nights, you cried all alone. For all of your tears... love will atone."

It might not burn very strong. But I know it's coming on. It will come on, come on, come on"

this road,"All heavy laden acquainted with sorrow. May Christ in our marrow carry us home. From alabaster come blessings of laughter. A fragrance of passion and joy from the truth. Grant the unbroken tears ever flowing. From hearts of contrition only for You. May sin never hold true that love never broke through. For God's mercy holds us and we are His own. This road that we travel may it be the straight and narrow. God, give us peace and grace from You, all the day. Shelter with fire, our voices we raise still higher. God, give us peace and grace from You, all the day through."
thou lovely source of true delight,"Thou lovely source of true delight whom I unseen adore. Unveil Thy beauties to my sight that I might love Thee more. Oh that I might love Thee more. Thy glory o’er creation shines yet in Thy sacred word. I read in fairer brighter lines my bleeding, dying Lord. Oh my bleeding, dying Lord. ‘Tis here whene’er my comforts droop and sin and sorrows rise. Thy love with cheering beams of hope my fainting heart supplies. My fainting heart’s supplied. And ah too soon the pleasing scene is clouded over with pain. My gloomy fears rise dark between and I again complain. Oh and I again complain. Jesus my Lord, my life, my light, oh come with blissful ray. Break radiant through the shades of night and chase my fears away. Won’t you chase my fears away. Then shall my soul with rapture trace the wonders of Thy love. But the full glories of Thy face are only known above. They are only known above. Oh come let us adore. My bleeding dying Lord"
trouble is,"My wings don't sail me to the sky. On my own these wings won't fly. Jesus told me so. Still I'm not so sure that I know. Can't find no rest for my soul. Can't find no rest on my own. Jesus told me so. Still I'm not so sure that I know. Man, the trouble is. We don't know who we are instead. Man, the trouble is. We don't know who we are instead. I'll keep runnin' the other way. My heart ain't built to stay. My heart ain't built to stay. And the world just ain't that way. Man, the trouble is. We don't know who we are instead. Man, the trouble is. We don't know who we are instead. We don't know who we are instead. My heart ain't built to stay. My heart ain't built to stay."
truce,"Faultless in the eyes that I could never open wide enough to see me through. Much to my surprise it never orbits around the things you should hold me to. I stand here...wondering. And I'm waiting. Chorus:. My ear is twisted in all the thoughts. A glimpse of truce just because. It's always almost never close. I close my eyes, hide the distance. Enchanted by the face of peace and when it turns to sunken eyes and waterfalls. Unsatisfied with simple things entangled in the chords, I can't take any calls. I stand here waiting. I'm calling. [Chorus]. Waiting around for some kind of peace. Hoping you find me in my need. My ear is twisted. It's always almost. [Chorus]."
two hands,"I've been living out of sanity. I've been splitting hairs and blurring lines. I am a house that is divided. In my heart and in my mind. I use one hand to pull you closer. The other to push you away. If I had two hands doing the same thing. Lifted high, lifted high. I have a broken disposition. I'm a liar who thirsts for the truth. And while I ache for faith to hold me. I need to feel the scars and see the proof. And if we just keep digging we can reach the foundation. Of our souls. And if we just keep cutting all the chains from our hearts. We'll lose control. And it feels like giving in. It feels like starting over. It feels like waking up, and you know it's coming. It feels like a brand new day. Open your eyes"
unforgetful you,"Unforgetful You. I never minded calling You a King. If that meant that I could count on You. To give me everything. I never thought to ask You. I always thought You knew. It was never my intention to question You. You never minded calling me a child. Well, I guess that's how I acted all the while. But You live through every tantrum, You see through every lie. Though they seem to be more common. I just wanted You to know why oh why. Unforgetful You, unforgetful. Unforgetful You, so unforgetful. You never minded giving us the stars. Then showing us how blind and unaware of You we are. You painted me a picture and showed me how to see. Though I just won't behold it. Unless it pertains to me...."
waiting for the world to fall,Artist: Jars Of Clay Lyrics. Song: Waiting For The World To Fall Lyrics. I'm afraid it's been too long to try to find the reasons why. I let my world close in around a smaller patch of fading sky. But now I've grown beyond the walls to where I've never been. And it's still winter in my wonderland. Chorus. I'm waiting for the world to fall. I'm waiting for the scene to change. I'm waiting when the colors come. I'm waiting to let my world come undone. I close my eyes and try to see the world unbroken underneath. The farther off and already it just might make the life I lead. A little more than make-believe when all my skies are painted blue. And the clouds don't ever change the shape of who I am to You. Chorus. I'm waiting for the world to fall. I'm waiting for the scene to change. I'm waiting when the colors come. I'm waiting to let my world come undone. When I catch the light of falling stars my view is changing me. My view is changing me. I'm waiting
water under the bridge,"I do not love you the way I did when we met.. There are secrets and arguments I haven't finished yet.. But it's only that grace has outlived our regret that we're still here.. So maybe we can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge,. We can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge.. There are times meant for breaking, and words to ignore,. And a bent to our souls when our skin is at war.. And if leaving were freedom, well, we'd both walk right out of that door.. Maybe we can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge,. We can stay, till the last drop of water flows.. And the years roll by, and you hold my hand, while the shadows stretch over the land.. Crumble and fall in my arms, and we'll struggle to hold on.. Waters they rise and they carry our hopes and dreams away, baby we can stay, stay.. And the years roll by, and you hold my hand, while the shadows stretch over the land.. Maybe we can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge,. We can stay, till the last drop of water flows under the bridge,. We can stay till the last drop of water flows under the bridge."
weapons,"Hallelujah, we can finally hear. It's a miracle we feel anything at all. Things we planted on the worst days of the year. Grew to fingers that rip at the joy. And set our backs against the wall. Lay your weapons down. Lay your weapons down. There are no enemies in front of you. Hallelujah, we can finally see. How the bitterness was bruising on our skin. We didn't notice that grace had run so thin. Till we're falling apart and the cracks in our hearts let the truth sink in"
weighed down,"Light of the world. Are you still here?. And are we illuminating?. When love becomes a delicate display. So weak, dissolved by anything. Love lies here waiting all alone. Can a king be a king. Weighed down?. Our hearts, a bubble maker's dream. Moved on by winds of everything. As we deny that love is still the king. Not as weak as we make him out to be. Love lies here waiting all alone. Can a king be a king. Weighed down?. Weighed down. Weighed down. Weighed down. Weighed down."
what wondrous love,"What wondrous love is this oh my soul oh my soul. What wondrous love is this oh my soul. What wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss. To bear the dreadful curse for my soul for my soul. To bear the dreadful curse for my soul. When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down. When I was sinking down, sinking down. When I was sinking down beneath God’s righteous frown. Christ laid aside His crown for my soul for my soul. Christ laid aside His crown for my soul. [chorus]. To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing. To God and to the Lamb I will sing. To God and to the Lamb who is the great I Am. While millions join the theme I will sing. And when from death I’m free I’ll sing on I’ll sing on. And when from death I’m free I’ll sing on. And when from death I’m free I’ll sing and joyful be. And through eternity I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on. And through eternity I’ll sing on"
whatever she wants,"all her wants to fill a need. she wants to save you with her bandages. after she makes you bleed. like a vampire, a parasite. stretch the neck of her victim. she finds her prey in broad daylight. when you're up, she's down. you're down, she's up, it whips around. it's the ride the way that she needs it. CHORUS:. whatever she wanted for whatever you need. speechless and silent while she takes everything. kryptonite underneath. you used to be her superman. but now you're fading, now you're weak. never how or why. it worked to play the big lie. to dim the truth from causing her wet eyes.

work,"Just in case. I will leave my things packed. So I can run away. I cannot trust these voices. I don't have a lot of prospects. That can give some kind of peace. There is nothing left to cling to. That can bring me sweet release. I have no fear of drowning. It's the breathing. That's taking all this work. Do you know. What I mean. When I say. ""I don't wanna be alone"". What I mean. When I say. ""I don't wanna be alone"". Empty spaces. Shadows hit by streetlights. The warning signs and weight. Of tired conversations. In the absence of a shoulder. In the absence of a thief. On the brink of this destruction. On the eve of bittersweet. Now all the demons look like prophets. And I'm living out. Every word they speak. Every word they speak. Do you know. What I mean. When I say. ""I don't wanna be alone"". What I mean. When I say. ""I don't wanna be alone"". I have no fear of drowning. It's the breathing. It's taking all this work"
worlds apart,"I am the only one to blame for this. Somehow it all ends up the same. Soaring on the wings of selfish pride. I flew too high and like Icarus I collide. With a world I try so hard to leave behind. To rid myself of all but love. to give and die. To turn away and not become. Another nail to pierce the skin of one who loves. more deeply than the oceans,. more abundant than the tear. Of a world embracing every heartache. Can I be the one to sacrifice. Or grip the spear and watch the blood and water flow. To love you - take my world apart. To need you - I am on my knees. To love you - take my world apart. To need you - broken on my knees. All said and done I stand alone. Amongst remains of a life I should not own. It takes all I am to believe. In the mercy that covers me. Did you really have to die for me?. All I am for all you are. Because what I need and what I believe are worlds apart. Additional lyrics:. I look beyond the empty cross. Forgetting what my life has cost. And wipe away the crimson stains. And dull the nails that still remain. More and more I need you now,. I owe you more each passing hour. The battle between grace and pride. I gave up not so long ago. So steal my heart and take the pain. And wash the feet and cleanse my pride. Take the selfish, take the weak,. And all the things I cannot hide. Take the beauty, take my tears. The sin-soaked heart and make it yours. Take my world all apart. Take it now, take it now. And serve the ones that I despise. Speak the words I can't deny. Watch the world I used to love. Fall to dust and thrown away. I look beyond the empty cross. Forgetting what my life has cost. So wipe away the crimson stains. And dull the nails that still remain. So steal my heart and take the pain. Take the selfish, take the weak. And all the things I cannot hide. Take the beauty, take my tears. Take my world apart, take my world apart. I pray, I pray, I pray. Take my world apart"
you're here,"Music & Lyrics by : Leigh Nash. My life is up and it is down. I try to keep both feet on the ground. Your love is all that gets me through. All I need on this earth is you. And I can hear your voice reciting:. ""I'm here, I'm closer than your breath. I've conquered even death. I am still here. And just like I was then. You can't remember when I was not here"". Jesus, you're the author of my heart. Told me you wanted every part. And now my life and its demands. Are resting safety in your hands. And I can hear your voice inviting:. ""I'm here,. I'll never leave your side. My stubborn weary child. I am still here. Please let me lead you on. Your race is already won. I am your God"". And I can hear your voice inviting:. ""I'm here,. I'll never leave you side. My stubborn weary child. I am still here. Please let me lead you on. Your race is already won. I am...I am...your God"""
