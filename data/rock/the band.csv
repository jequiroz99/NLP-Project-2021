Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith. When I get there I wonder what she'll do. Now in my day I've made some foolish moves. But back then, I didn't worry 'bout a thing. And now again I still wonder to myself. Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing. I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie. Oh, See her soon. Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith. When I get there I wonder what she'll do. There's so much time has gone right on by. I didn't think one could be so wrong. And then one night I was drinkin' and a-thinkin'. In the bottom of the glass I could see Bessie's face so strong. I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie. Oh, See her soon. Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith. When I get there I wonder what she'll do. When she sees me will she know what I've been through?. Will old times start to feelin' like new?. When I get there will our love still feel so true?. Yet all I have, I'll be a-bringin' it to you. Oh Bessie, sing them old-time blues."
up on cripple creek,"A D. When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?. A D E. Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico. A D. To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew. A D E. She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do. Refrain:. A. Up on Cripple Creek she sends me. D. If I spring a leak she mends me. E. I don't have to speak, she defends me. F#m G. A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one. Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go. She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show. The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one. When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won. (refrain). I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half. And she tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh. Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see. That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea. (refrain). Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box. She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk"". Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet. And I swore and I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat. (refrain). Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold. And this living on the road is getting pretty old. So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in. But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted. To go and see my Bessie again.. (refrain)."

Like my father before me, I will work the land,. Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand.. He was just eighteen, proud and brave,. But a Yankee laid him in his grave,. I swear by the mud below my feet,. You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat."

where do we go from here?,"Did you hear about the eagle of distinction. The one that came on every Friday afternoon. Well, it seems that eagle has near flown into extinction. Descending to the sand. His biggest enemy being man. Have you ever seen the freedom on the wing. Where do we go from here? I asked my woman. Where do we go from here? Oh woman, my woman. La la la la la la la la la, she said, nowhere. Did you hear about the railroad going under. How it seems its days are numbered on the board. Well, I feel sad about the railroad and it's no wonder. It'd run right by my door. I can't hear it anymore. How can you get to sleep when the whistle don't moan. Where do we go from here? Is there no way of knowing. Where do we go from here? Oh, I need to be shown. La la la la la la la la la, they said, somewhere. Have you heard about the buffalo on the plain. And how at one time they'd stampede a thousand strong. Now that buffalo's at the zoo standing in the rain. Just one more victim of fate. Like California state. You sure do miss the silence when it's gone. Where do we go from here? I hear from no one. Where do we go from here? Could you tell me, someone. La la la la la la la la la, I'd go anywhere."
the well,"I took my bucket down to the well. There's a (desert?) woman, sweet mystery. She let the rope fall down in the well. Like it was meant to be. She put the jug upon her head. Walked with her back to the wind. I followed her tracks the moment she said. ""Why don't you come in?"". chorus:. She killed the light, she dropped her glove. She said ""Are you looking for trouble. Or looking for love, love, love?"". I woke in the morning dying of thirst. Headed straight back to the well. There she was with a jug on her head. The rope had just fell. The well in her eyes was deep and black. With no question or answer. She wiped my brow and I followed her back. To the Tropic of Cancer. chorus."

the high price of love,"I can see in the mirror that edge had a little fuzz. Her business card didn't tell me what her business was. A beautiful care package sent to a starving man. I ate all of that and I was hungry again. I heard a sound, a knock on the door. That room was empty, she ain't live there anymore. I was standin' there, reflecting on my own. What's gonna happen to that five hundred dollar loan?. It ain't worth it cryin' these tears. Put 'em all in a vile, fill it up to here. Toss 'em all into the Persian Gulf. Forget about it, man, just write it off. As a high price of love. As a high price of love. There's something wrong all across the nation. Everybody, everywhere, is a victim of inflation. Someone takes advantage, thinks they won't get beat. They think they got a bargain but they're only got it cheap. It ain't worth it cryin' these tears. Put 'em all in a vile, fill it up to here. Toss 'em all into the Persian Gulf. Forget about it, man, just write it off. As a high price of love. High price of love. 'Cause it ain't worth it cryin' these tears. Put 'em all in a vile, fill it up to here. Toss 'em all into the Persian Gulf. Forget about it, man, just write it off. As a high price of love. As a high price of love. As a high price of love.

And I don't know whether to call or check. But right now I feel like I got a royal flush. And my lady didn't show from 'Frisco. But we had to go on with the show.

I'm ridin' on a river of dreams.. Amazon, Amazon,. Is it heaven or hell?. Amazon.. An eagle flew above us, I felt the breezes blow.. Fish with teeth like ivory, waited down below..

I'm ridin' on a river of dreams.. Amazon, Amazon,. Is it Heaven or hell ?. Amazon.. What kind of creature's gonna rise up from these ashes?. What's gonna fly in the moonlight feathers aglow?. What kind of rain could come in from these sorrows?. Nobody knows, nobody knows.. At dawn we crossed the rapids, a place where few men go.. I felt the desolation, where nothing seemed to grow.. When I got my wages, I hung my head and cried.. I could not stop these visions, that swept in like the tide.. Ridin' on a river of dreams,. Broken dreams.. I'm ridin' on a river of dreams..

Now I'm coldly fading fast, I don't think I'm gonna last. Very much longer. ""She's stoned"" said the Swede, and the moon calf agreed. I'm like a viper in shock with my eyes in the clock. She was just there somewhere and here I am again. And as my mind unweaves, I feel the freeze down in my knees. But just before she leaves, she receives."

day of reckoning (burnin for you),"In this dusty little railroad town. Smack in the heart of the bible belt. Where nothing ever changes. While nothing remains the same. When first I saw the raven. Lean against the wind. I said who's the girl. With the tattoo on her skin. I followed her home. She lives down by the water. My friend Teddy told me. She's the Frenchman's daughter. On this day of reckoning. I'm riding shotgun with you. Tangled twisted strands of love. Hanging from above. Chorus:. I'm burnin for you. Burnin for you. We were first time lovers. In a secret rendezvous. Burnin, burnin. Burnin for you. When I come knocking on her front door. The neighbour said she don't live there no more. Well she moved from the country. down to the city. Where the scene was dark. And the street was gritty. In the hustle and bustle and all the commotion. She got addicted to the locomotion. On this day of reckoning. By the old wooden bridge. I wait for you. Tangled twisted strands of love. Hanging from above. Chorus. I remember the smell of the burning leaves. And we were making love. She was like a young Georgia O'Keefe. From another time. In an old abandoned railroad shack. On should never go. Where anything can happen. When the zephyr blows. On this day of reckoning. I'm calling to you. Tangled twisted strands of love. Hanging from above. Chorus. The phone rings she said. I can't tell you where I'm calling from. Cause my papa's on the lam. For something shady that he's done. There hangs a tale of love. For the first time. For the first time."

golden feather,I think I'll go on back to Shenandoah. She said that she'd meet me by the fork in the road. I jump start my one eyed Ford. I'm heading for the pow-wow. I follow red path that leads to you. (chorus). I gave my love a golden feather. I gave my love a heart of stone. And when you find a golden feather. It means you'll never lose your way back home. Should I paint my face. Should I pierce my skin. Does this make me a pagan. Sweating out my sins. We ate the sacred mushroom. And waded in the water. Howling like coyotes. At the naked moon. (chorus). In the autumn night. When there's no wind blowin'. I could hear the stars falling in the dark. When you find what's worth keeping. With a breath of kindness. Blow the rest away. (chorus).

havana moon,"Havana moon. Havana moon. Havana moon. Havana moon. All alone with a jug of rum. Sittin' waiting for the boat to come. Along the line they quietly dock. The boat she's late since twelve o-clock. And watch the tides come breezing in. Below the moon but high they went. Havana moon. Havana moon. Havana moon. Havana moon. Still all alone, I open a rum. I wonder when the boat should come. American girl comes back to me. We sail away across the sea. The dock in New York, the building is high. We'll find a home up in the sky. Havana moon. Havana moon. Havana moon. Havana moon. Still all alone, sipping on a rum. Still wonder when the boat should come. And bring my love, oh sweet little thing. She rocks 'n' rolls, she can dance and sing. She holds me tight, and she touches my lips. I had the clothes, and my heart she flips. Havana moon. Havana moon. Havana moon. Havana moon."

hold back the dawn,The sun was going down. Over Echo Park. Wet raven hair. Glowing in the dark. And that's when the fever would rise. And lord what a look in her eyes. From the moment that she blows out the light. We'd be lost in the forever night. Chorus:. Hold back the dawn. Hold back the dawn. Won't you raise up your hand. And hold back the dawn. I dreamt if I could lay you upon this. bed of straw. We may break the rules but we don't. break the law. Come across but the river's too wide. Come across but the river's too high. Over by the fountain where we meet. I will lay silver roses at your feet. Chorus. Now I have seen a painting. Old and hanging in a frame. And that painting was of you. Now how can you explain. From another place in time. Done many years ago. Why I'm haunted by this vision. Guess we'll never know. Then she turned and whispered in my ear. Can you feel my heart beat. Chorus. Won't you raise. Won't you raise up. Won't you raise up your hand. And hold back the dawn. Chorus.

it is a good day to die,The general rode for sixteen days. The horses were thirsty and tired. On the trail of a renegade chief. One he'd come to admire. The soldiers hid behind the hills. That surrounded the village. And he rode down to warn the chief. They'd come to conquer and pillage. Lay down your arms. Lay down your spear. The chief's eyes were sad. But showed no sign of fear. (chorus). It is a good day to die. Oh my children dry your eyes. It is a good day to die. He spoke of the days before the white man came. With his guns and whisky. He told of a time a long time ago. Before what you call history. The general couldn't believe his words. Nor the look on his face. But he knew these people would rather die. Then have to live in this disgrace. What law have I broken. What wrong have I done. That makes you want to bury me. Upon this trail of blood. (chorus). We cared for the land and the land cared for us. And that's the way it's always been. Never asked for more never asked too much. And now you tell me this is the end. I laid down my weapon. Laid down my bow. Now you want to drive me out. With no place left to go. (chorus). And he turned to his people and said dry your eyes. We've been blessed and we are thankful. Raise your voices to the sky.

While watch dogs bay at the moon. A preacher on an orange crate. With a Salvation Army Band. And clicking along the cobbled stones. That's the sound of the ice-cream man. Comin' up the lane callin'. Workin' while the rain's fallin'. Ragman, your song of the street. Keeps haunting my memory. Music in the air. I hear it ev'rywhere. Rags, bones and old city songs. Hear them, how they talk to me. The organ grinder and his monkey. Still walkin' the same old beat. The shoe-shine boy slappin' leather. He puts the rhythm in your feet. Strollin' by the churchyard. List'nin' to the Sunday choir. With voices rising to the heavens. Like sirens screaming to a fire. Comin' up to the lane callin'. Workin' while the rain's fallin'. Ragman, your song of the street. Keeps haunting my memory. Music in the air. I hear it ev'rywhere. Rags, bones and old city songs. Play them one more time for me."
rain down tears,"You say you're leaving, ain't comin' back. There's nothing I can say to make you unpack. It's gonna rain down tears, rain down tears. You need a shelter somewhere, somewhere. When you're out there, in this world alone. There's gonna be many alike, you'll miss your happy home. It's gonna rain down tears, rain down tears. You'll need a shelter somewhere, somewhere. One empty sag, the look on your face. When you come back darling, someone's in your face. It's gonna rain down tears, rain down tears. You need a shelter somewhere, somewhere."

rattlebone,Pay no mind to his messed up hair. Pay no mind to the clothes he wears. It's just the hours he's been keepin'. Ain't been doing too much sleeping. They dyed his hair and hid his feathers. And told him he was Latin. 'Til he came chanting down the street. Like a cannibal in Manhattan. CHORUS:. Rattlebone. Rattlebone. Shake it for the war chief. All night long. Rattlebone. Rattlebone. Sweet medicine. To each his own. One sky above. One earth below. One sky above us. One earth below. CHORUS. Here's where we go off the map. Out past the power lines. Up that little side road without a sign. Hidden from the mainstream. The keepers of the ancient future. Keepers of the drum. They don't preserve it. They live it. Rattlebone. Rattlebone. Shake it for the war chief. All night long. Rattlebone. Rattlebone. Get down on your knees. And praise the dawn. CHORUS.
remedy,"Now it's so cold in your doorway that I can hardly breathe. You know I wanna lay down but I'm afraid I'll freeze.. I've spent my last lone dollar getting in the shape that I'm in. And runnin' from the border just as fast as they can.. Well, last September I was on a roll. Now I'm out here trying to save my soul.. You've got the cure, you hold the key,. You've got the remedy.. Once I was blind, now I see. You got the remedy.. I believe you got in something just like a stingray. And when you turn on your moves you put the hurt on me.. Well, I might get better but I won't get well. Until I'm over the line and I'm under your spell.. I'm like a spider crawlin' up your wall,. Hear something funny, it's my matin' call.. You've got the cure, you hold the key,. You've got the remedy.. Once I was blind, now I see. You got the remedy.. Been knocking on your window, a-peeking through the blinds. Honey, come here a-runnin', won't you take your time.. And now I ain't no preacher man, I ain't no preacher's son. But I'll be singing hallelujah when I see you come.. I left my mind at the fork in the road. I' m out here haulin' a heavy load.. You've got the cure, you hold the key,. You've got the remedy.. Once I was blind, now I see. You got the remedy.. You've got the cure, you hold the key,. You've got the remedy.. It goes to show. It's plain to see. You got the remedy.."
resurrection,When you grow up on blue highways. And that's what you call home. All the people would stop and stare. At this old orphan of the road. In the beginning they did not believe me. But they believe me now. Tell my mama and tell my papa. I wish they could see me now. Chorus:. I'm coming back. For the resurrection. For the resurrection. I'm coming back. For the resurrection. For the resurrection. You're an outcast in a land of strangers. And that'a a cardinal sin. Make a break for the outside world. And they won't let you in. If you get lost out on Coney Island. Tell all my friends hello. That's where I learned the rules of the game. They taught me all I know. Chorus. You were drowning in a sea of laughter. Tears were in your eyes. When you found out what you were after. I could see your spirit rise. Chorus.

sacrifice,You know we have a million stories to tell. I'm just one of a million or more stories that could be told. Chorus:. Sacrifice your freedom. Sacrifice your prayer. Take away your language. Cut off all your hair. Sacrifice the loved ones. Who always stood by me. Stranded in the wasteland. Set my spirit free. My name is Leonard Peltier. I am a Lakota and Anishnabe. And I am living in the United States penitentiary. Which is the swiftest growing. Indian reservations in the country. I have been in prison since 1976. For an incident that took place on the Oglala-Lakota Nation. There was a shoot-out between members of the American Indian Movement. And The FBI and the local Sheriffs State Troopers. Two agents were killed and one Indian was murdered. Three of us were charged with the deaths of the FBI agents. My co-defendants were found not-guilty by reasons of self-defense. My case was separated and I was found guilty before a jury of non-Indian. people. The prosecutor stated that they did not know who killed their agents. Nor did he know what participation Leonard Peltier may have played in it. But someone has to pay for the crime. There's a lot of nights that I lay in my cell. And I can't understand why this hell this hell and this terror. That I have been going through for twenty-one years hasn't ended. Chorus. But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay sacrifice. To make things better for our people. The sacrifice I have made when I really sit down to think about it. Is nothing compared to what our people a couple hundred years ago. Or fifty years ago or twenty-five years ago have made. Some gave their lives. Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arms. So the sacrifice I have made is nothing compared to those. I've gone too far now to start backing down. I don't give up. Not 'til my people are free will I give up. And if I have to sacrifice some more.

shine a light,"From outside the open window. How the faithful was gathered to sing. As the tears swelled up inside me. Still down in a mournful rain.. And all sands of time stood still. As the procession climbed the hill. And off in the distance it's a mother run away. The father turned to say. Somebody shine a light, show me the way. Take me through the night to the break of day.. Won't you shine a light so I can see,. Lift up these chains of darkness and set me free.. Lookin' through the open window. I can see where I went wrong.. I quit searching for the rainbow,. I forgot where I belong.. Then the darkness dips around me. And I have no strength to fight. Though I'll search for those who love me. I'll search for the one above me. Just like I said. Somebody shine a light, show me the way,. Take me through the night to the break of day.. Won't you shine a light so I can see,. Lift up these chains of darkness and set me free.. And all sands of time stood still. As the echo crossed my window sill.. I heard it plain as day, I could hear 'em sing,. I'm trying to find the way,. Somebody shine a light, show me the way. Make it through the night to the break of day.. Won't you shine a light so I can see,. Lift up these chains of darkness and set me free.. Shine a light, show me the way. Take me through the night to the break of day.. Shine a light so I can see. Lift up these chains of darkness and set me free.. Shine a light so I can see. Lift up these chains of darkness and set me free.."

And she would tell a story. Of the rainbow. Rainbow. I come to you with an empty heart. It's locked and I've lost the key. Now she was old and almost blind. But she sees more than you or me. With her cane pointed towards the sky. She said I'll know if you've heard. The silence between the words. Of the rainbow. Rainbow. No one knows. Where the rainbow goes. Walk down the long road. Your back against the wind. Where you can lose yourself again. I've been down the old road. But that was long ago. I want you to walk with me. When the rains come again. And shine this light over you. Rainbow. That's the sign of the rainbow. Walk on down the hard road. That's buried in your soul. And you can feel the light within. Go upon the mountain. That's painted in the sky. I want you to ride with me. When the rains come again. And I will carry you home. Walkin to the rainbow. The halo of the sun. And you will dance the song of light. I could see forever. High upon the hill. I want you to walk with me. When the rains come again. And shine this light over you. Rainbow. Rainbow.

And it's small town talk, you know how people are. They can't stand to see, someone else. Doing what they want to. And it's small town talk, it's a well known fact. You don't ever know how one might react."
smoke signal,"Went to the movie matinee. To see the blue coats try to get away. From a smoke signal. Above the trees. A smoke signal. Shifting in the breeze. Some folks think it's make believe. Other folks ain't so naive. About a smoke signal. Could see it coming. A smoke signal. Hear the drums drumming. You don't believe what you read in the paper. You can't believe the stranger at your door. You don't believe what you hear from your neighbor. Your old neighborhood ain't even there no more. Indian maid will plant the seed. And cultivate a whole new breed. There's a smoke signal. Over your head. A smoke signal. You know what it said?. When they're torn out by the roots. Young brothers join in cahoots. To send a smoke signal. Near and far. A smoke signal. No matter where you are. You don't believe what they say on the radio. You don't believe what you see on the video. Living in the shadow of a doubt today. Still waiting for the smoke to clear away. Tried to get in touch with you. Tried to get my message through. By smoke signal. Honey, do ya read me. Smoke signal. Call me if you need me. There you were all in white. Standing out in the broad daylight. Lookin' like a smoke signal. From heaven above. Smoke signal. Oh, my love."
soap box preacher,"Soap box preacher standing on the corner. And all the people they would gather round. You speak of faith with a blaze of glory. But those that fear they wanna knock you down. Nobody knows where you live. Where do you go in the naked night. All of the prophets that come before you. They can hear your lonesome cry. When you're out there in the night. All alone. When you're staring in the light. At the end of the road. Chorus:. In those proud shoes, coming on up the alley. In those proud shoes, walks all over the sky. Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote. And said don't let the rapture pass you by. Heard a bugle blowing in the misty morning. What a haunting sound over Times Square. Heard of the ghost of 52nd Street. Looked out the door but no one was there. Out in the cold Harlem rain. I went looking for this minstrel man. Played me a song to ease the pain. With a Salvation Army band. When you're out there on the dark. All alone. When you're sleeping in the park. At the end of the road. Chorus. In the neon wilderness and the ashphalt jungle. He carries his cross of passion. Through the wreckage and the rumble. Chorus:. In those proud shoes, coming on up the alley. In those proud shoes, walks all over the sky. Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote. And said don't let the rapture. Don't let the rapture pass you by. Don't let it pass you by."
stage fright,"Now deep in the heart of a lonely kid. Who suffered so much for what he did,. They gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame,. Since that day he ain't been the same.. See the man with the stage fright. Just standin' up there to give it all his might.. And he got caught in the spotlight,. But when we get to the end. He wants to start all over again..

sweet romance,"Alone in the shadows, of a willow tree. I watched from the dark. As you crossed through the park. Coming closer to me. Those brief moments return of the day we first met. The time we shared with that special care. Free from all jealousy. There must be a distant place. Far from every wrong face. Tears won't fall by chance. On this sweet romance .... Where the light of the moon, and the lay of the land. Brightened the way of so many nights. Helping us understand. The line that we crossed, to climb those hills. Gave us the strength to never fear. The hurting talk folks want to hear. There must be a different place. Far from every wrong face. Tears won't fall by chance. On this sweet romance .... When they hear, of our last goodbye. They'll have to seek another dream to surprise. With desperate lies. As we parade, far from these streets. We'll be side by side, livin life in pride. With love's lullabye. There must be a distant place. Far from every wrong face. Tears won't fall by chance."
take your partner by the hand,"She walks alone down a sleazy backstreet. Around a corner, up an alley to a dead end. There under a small blue light. She enters an unmarked doorway. (A low heartbeat, a low pounding escapes into the night). This is a place she goes to fulfill a very basic need. Something people have been doing since the dawn of man. To communicate without talking. If she needs something. She makes a gesture with her hand. And mouths what she wants. She wants to make a connection. A certain kind of connection. No this is not about something from the black market. This is about no questions. This is about smoke and sweat and beats. This is about no message. CHORUS:. Take your partner by the hand. He's a woman, she's a man. What's so hard to understand. Take your partner by the hand. Mona in the promised land. Take your partner by the hand. Keep it simple if you can. Take your partner by the hand. At the club they circle around some sex goddess like vultures. Flashbulbs popping. Like bees around their queen. She is completely indifferent to all the commotion. And orders some mango tango ice cream by sign language. She's approached by some wild-eyed poet drunk with love. I like her easy refusal, the way she shakes her head. She lives these days in the attic of an old dance hall. That's been shut down for years. And swears there's times when she can hear feet shuffling below. And can see the shadows swaying, moving to the music. CHORUS (first half). Elevator going up. Fifth floor. Lady's handbags, shoes, leather accessories, and electronics. Wait a minute, where am I, on this elevator to nowhere. Going up, going down. Then like a hallucination. I saw her out of the corner of my eye. Studying some shoes very carefully. She definitely had a particular purpose for these shoes in mind. Then as quickly as she appeared, she disappeared. Back into the slash and burn of New York. Ah, stuck in traffic. Crosstown, the stress of not moving. She described it as like being locked in a car. With a madman behind the wheel. And the radio tuned to static. CHORUS."
tears of rage,"C Am F Dm. We carried you in our arms on Independence Day. Bb F C. And now you'd throw us all aside and put us all away. Am F Dm.

Why must I always be the thief?. E7 Am. Come to me now, you know we're so low. F C7 Fmaj7 C. And life is brief. It was all very painless. When you went out to receive. All that false instruction. Which we never could believe. And now the heart is filled with gold. As if it was a purse. But, oh, what kind of love is this. Which goes from bad to worse?. (Chorus). We pointed you the way to go. And scratched your name in sand. Though you just thought it was nothing more. Than a place for you to stand. I want you to know that while we watched. You discovered no one would be true. And I myself was among. The ones who thought. It was just a childish thing to do. (Chorus)."
that's my home,"You how long I've waited. I waited for so long. It needs a place I'm going. That's my home. Princie, how do you do?. They all greeted too. Others have done so too. That's my home.

That's my home. (bridge). And friends say, ""How do you do?"". We all greeted too. Others have done so too. That's my home. That's my home. That's my home."
the caves of jericho,"Dm Dm7/C G A. They should have known that trouble was brewing. Dm Dm7/C Asus4 A. They should have seen what the old men knew. Bb F/A. They should have shut us down. Gm Dm.

And the news came afterwards. ""It's a blow out down in Number Two!"". Dm/B F/C. Down in Jericho Kentucky. A/C# Dm. The mines have all caved in. Bb E/G# A C. Down in Jericho. F. Broken hearts don't mend. E7 D#maj7 D. Tear stained eyes of kin. Bb C# F A A/C#. Never ever seen what the future might have been. The hat lamps burned with a flame like lightning. The coal dust blanketed the morning dew.. The young ones looked for kin. And the blind man, he looks grim.. 'Cause he sees there's nothing that he can do.. They pumped up the mud and they chunked out water,. They scratched the earth till it turned to sand. And a half mile down below. It's a lost cause the miners know. Meet your maker, boys, the time's at hand.. Down in Jericho, Kentucky. The mines have all caved in. Down in Jericho.. Broken hearts don't mend. Tears stained eyes of kin. Never ever seen. What their future might have been.. The fire boss's hands are clean as a whistle. The fat cat knows he's a company man. But he should have bowed down his head. When they hauled out all the dead. But it's business, boys, start 'em up again.. Down in Jericho, Kentucky. The mines have all caved in. Down in Jericho.. Broken hearts don't mend. Tears stained eyes of kin. Never ever seen. What their future might have been.. Broken hearts don't mend. Tears stained eyes of kin. Never ever seen. What their future might have been.."
the code of handsome lake,"*These are the People of the Longhouse. These are the People that you tried to break. These are the People of the Pines. Who Follow the Code of Handsome Lake. He drank your poison, swallowed your fire. And lay with fever four long years. He received a vision so inspired. Three messengers with painted faces appeared. On the Allegheny river at a place called Burnt House. The code was shared for the very first time. By a Seneca chief, they call Handsome Lake. With a Wounded Heart and a sober mind. *Repeat. **We are the People of the Longhouse. We are the People that you couldn't break. We are the People of the Sacred Pipe. Who Follow The Code of Handsome Lake. When the Dark Moon had come to live in your soul. Get in touch with your creator, you are not alone. These are the words. That he had spoken two hundred years ago. And today they still ring true. Like they're carved in stone. When Native life was hurled into the pit. By way of the Canon, Rum, and Greed.

the great pretender,"Oh yes, I'm the great pretender. Pretending that I'm doing well. My need is such, I pretend too much. I'm lonely but no one can tell. Oh yes, I'm the great pretender. Adrift in a world of my own. I play the game, but to my real shame. You left me to dream all alone. Too real is this feeling of make believe. Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal. Oh yes, I'm the great pretender. Just laughing and gay like a clown. I seem to be what I'm not, you see. I'm wearing my heart like a crown. Pretending that you're still around.

the high price of love,"I can see in the mirror that edge had a little fuzz. Her business card didn't tell me what her business was. A beautiful care package sent to a starving man. I ate all of that and I was hungry again. I heard a sound, a knock on the door. That room was empty, she ain't live there anymore. I was standin' there, reflecting on my own. What's gonna happen to that five hundred dollar loan?. It ain't worth it cryin' these tears. Put 'em all in a vile, fill it up to here. Toss 'em all into the Persian Gulf. Forget about it, man, just write it off. As a high price of love. As a high price of love. There's something wrong all across the nation. Everybody, everywhere, is a victim of inflation. Someone takes advantage, thinks they won't get beat. They think they got a bargain but they're only got it cheap. It ain't worth it cryin' these tears. Put 'em all in a vile, fill it up to here. Toss 'em all into the Persian Gulf. Forget about it, man, just write it off. As a high price of love. High price of love. 'Cause it ain't worth it cryin' these tears. Put 'em all in a vile, fill it up to here. Toss 'em all into the Persian Gulf. Forget about it, man, just write it off. As a high price of love. As a high price of love. As a high price of love.

Only the low hum from the lights is still heard. CHORUS (2 times).

the saga of pepote rouge,"4 measures of G piano licks. G G/F |G/E G/D |. There's a legend of a lady on the mountain. G G/F |C/E D |. Who lives alone beyond the mecca plain. G G/F |G/E G/D |. And with her hands she makes it through the winter. C / / / |A- D |. She never goes against the grain. To be someone is to be someone alone. To be someone is known as solitude.

Called to me in a voice so soft and low. Her words resounded like a fountain of truth. And then she faded like a rainbow. Her golden spaceship with the mother of the earth. Carved in stone, the queen of avatars. Where seventy children were given birth. She then returned back to the stars. Break the news, Pepote Rouge is coming to town. We stand accused, Pepote Rouge, of bein' hellbound. She can help us find our way and get across. You don't know what you gained 'til you find out what you lost.. Intro. Pepote Rouge come down from the mountain. And lead our people into the light of day. For they are lost and know not where they're goin'. And all their leaders are cast in clay. Now disbelief and mass confusion. Spreading wild across the land. You can call it love or call it wisdom. To be not savin' a drowning man.. Break the news, Pepote Rouge is coming to town. We stand accused, Pepote Rouge, of bein' hellbound. She can show us just where we went wrong. You don't know where you're goin' 'til you find where you belong.."

the well,"I took my bucket down to the well. There's a (desert?) woman, sweet mystery. She let the rope fall down in the well. Like it was meant to be. She put the jug upon her head. Walked with her back to the wind. I followed her tracks the moment she said. ""Why don't you come in?"". chorus:. She killed the light, she dropped her glove. She said ""Are you looking for trouble. Or looking for love, love, love?"". I woke in the morning dying of thirst. Headed straight back to the well. There she was with a jug on her head. The rope had just fell. The well in her eyes was deep and black. With no question or answer. She wiped my brow and I followed her back. To the Tropic of Cancer. chorus."
thinkin' out loud,"I was thinkin' out loud. Talking to myself. I was up on a cloud. There was nobody else. No, no I did not call. I never was allowed. To speak up at all. I was just thinkin' out loud. Transylvania train, circus never came. The heroes are all gone. No trampoline, fell without a scream. Who's looking for a job. Before I realized, I was hypnotized. Flashback to the past. Cross-eyed jack, monkey on his back. We knew it would not last. Room service gone off duty. The bellman has retired. This hotel is a beauty. Even the house dick's been fired. Then the sky came crashing down. And knocked me off this cloud. When I fell to the ground. I was just thinkin' out loud."

But the picture is fading, and I'm tired of waiting ...."

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half. And she tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh. Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see. That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea. (refrain). Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box. She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk"". Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet. And I swore and I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat. (refrain). Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold. And this living on the road is getting pretty old. So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in. But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted. To go and see my Bessie again.. (refrain)."

When we cross that railroad track. There'll be no turning back. Come tread softly through the night. Don't leave me sitting here. Up on top of your fence. I'm like an alley cat up here, without a lick of sense. Volcano--I'm about to blow. Volcano--Gonna overflow. Volcano--Look out below. Don't leave me empty-handed. Like a villain in the woods. Prowling around the grounds, trying to make off with the goods. Volcano--I'm about to blow. Volcano--Gonna overflow. Volcano--Look out below."

We don't talk about forever. We just catch it while we can. And if I grab on to the moment. Don't let it slip away out of my hand. Chorus:. What about now. Forget about tomorrow. It's too far away. What about now. Close your eyes. Don't talk of yesterday. It's too far away, too far away. What about now. I'm coming out of the shadows. I'm getting of of this one way street. Blue memories they just gather dust. Leave them in the rain they turn into rust. Did you see the march to freedom. Did you ever see savannah moon. All the people walking in a line. said to the man, is it my time?. Chorus. In the walk of a lifetime. When you know it's the right time. I can't wait until the ship comes in. I can't wait starting all over again. The errors of a wise man. Make the rules for a fool."

where do we go from here?,"Did you hear about the eagle of distinction. The one that came on every Friday afternoon. Well, it seems that eagle has near flown into extinction. Descending to the sand. His biggest enemy being man. Have you ever seen the freedom on the wing. Where do we go from here? I asked my woman. Where do we go from here? Oh woman, my woman. La la la la la la la la la, she said, nowhere. Did you hear about the railroad going under. How it seems its days are numbered on the board. Well, I feel sad about the railroad and it's no wonder. It'd run right by my door. I can't hear it anymore. How can you get to sleep when the whistle don't moan. Where do we go from here? Is there no way of knowing. Where do we go from here? Oh, I need to be shown. La la la la la la la la la, they said, somewhere. Have you heard about the buffalo on the plain. And how at one time they'd stampede a thousand strong. Now that buffalo's at the zoo standing in the rain. Just one more victim of fate. Like California state. You sure do miss the silence when it's gone. Where do we go from here? I hear from no one. Where do we go from here? Could you tell me, someone. La la la la la la la la la, I'd go anywhere."
where i should always be,"When you find me walkin' in a dream. Like a falling leaf floating in the sea. Can you hear me prayin' on my knees, knockin' on your door? I can't take no more. As you hold me close to where I should always be. Maybe freedom was lost and disappeared. And the winter freeze covered all my tears. But I would let nothing melt me to the bone, eating me no more, I can't take no more. As you hold me close to where I should always be. I can breathe with all my might (I can breathe). I can touch and feel your life (I can feel). It's no wonder I can barely speak (I can speak). It's no wonder I can feel (I can feel). When you find me walkin' in a dream. Like a falling leaf floating in the sea. But can you hear me prayin' on my knees, knockin' on your door? I can't take no more. As you hold me close to where I should always be. Can you hear me prayin' on my knees, knockin' on your door? I can't take no more. As you hold me close to where I should always be. As you hold me close to where I should always be"

"words of fire, deeds of blood",Perhaps you think the Creator sent you here to dispose of us as you see fit. If I thought you were sent by the creator. I might be induced to think you had a right to dispose of me. Do not misunderstand me. But understand me fully with reference to my affection for the land. I never said the land was mine to do with as I choose. The one who has a right to dispose of it is the one who has created it. I claim a right to live on my land. And accord you the privilege to return to yours. Brother we have listened to your talk. Coming from our father the great White Chief at Washington. And my people have called upon me to reply to you. And in the winds which pass through these aged pines. We hear the moanings of their departed ghosts. And if the voice of our people could have been heard. That act would never have been done. But alas though they stood around they could neither be seen or heard. Their tears fell like drops of rain. I hear my voice in the depths of the forest. But no answering voice comes back to me. All is silent around me. My words must therefore be few. I can now say no more. He is silent for he has nothing to answer when the sun goes down.
