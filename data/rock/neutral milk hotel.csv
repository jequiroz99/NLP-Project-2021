in the aeroplane over the sea,What a beautiful face. I have found in this place. That is circling all round the sun. What a beautiful dream. That could flash on the screen. In a blink of an eye and be gone from me. Soft and sweet. Let me hold it close and keep it here with me. And one day we will die. And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea. But for now we are young. Let us lay in the sun. And count every beautiful thing we can see. Love to be. In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me. Anna's ghost all around. Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me. Soft and sweet. How the notes all bend and reach above the trees. Now how I remember you. How I would push my fingers through. Your mouth to make those muscles move. That made your voice so smooth and sweet. And now we keep where we don't know. All secrets sleep in winter clothes. With one you loved so long ago. Now he don't even know his name. What a beautiful face. I have found in this place. That is circling all round the sun. And when we meet on a cloud. I'll be laughing out loud. I'll be laughing with everyone I see. Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all. . (fonte: site oficial)
sailing through,"Sailing through your disease and you. Your disease and you. Your body's like a basket. Shivering in static. Ride this phase of angry tears. All those years you were alive inside the closet. With nobody in it there but me. But now you are coming. Your life is off running. Tearing itself apart at the seams. And you are a liar. You are a liar. You are a liar. And you are a lie. You are a liar. You are a liar. Now I'm off sailing. Sickness impaling. Every drop of blood you could bleed. The world is all coming. They're coming in millions. Billions of people to sick to believe. And I really wanted just to be in your body. To be in your body. To be inside you. And I really wanted just to be in your body. To share in your sickness. To shield around you. But you are a liar. You are a liar. You are a liar. And you are a lie. You are a liar. You are a liar. You are a liar. And you are a lie. Wrap you up in master. Cover you in plaster. Spit in your mouth and then say ""I love you"". But is this supposed to save us?. Is this supposed to break us. And I really wanted just to be in your body. I really want to be in your body. I really want to be inside you. And I really wanted just to be in your body. To share in your sickness.

naomi,"Your prettiness is seeping through. Out from the dress I took from you, so pretty. And my emptiness is swollen shut always. Always a wretch i have become. So empty. And please please dont leave me. I'm watching Naomi, full bloom. I'm hoping she will soon explode. Into one billion tastes and tunes. One billion angels come and hold her down. They hold her down until she shines. I'm tasting Naomi's perfume. It tastes like shit and I must say. She comes and goes most afternoons. One billion lovers wave and love her now. They could love her now and so could I. There is no Naomi in view. She walks through Cambridge stocks and strolls. And if she only really knew. One billion angels could come and save her soul. They could save her soul until she shines. So pretty. And please, please don't leave me here.."
oh comely,"Oh comely. I will be with you when you lose your breath. Chasing the only meaningful memory you thought you had left. With some pretty bright and bubbly terrible scene. That was doing her thing on your chest. But oh comely. It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess. in your memory, you're drunk on your autumn. it doesn't mean anything at all. Oh comely. All of your friends are letting you blow. Bristling and ugly. Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes. Of some pretty bright and bubbly friend. You could need to say comforting things in your ear. But oh comely. There isn't such one friend that you could find here. Standing next to me. He's only my enemy. I'll crush him with everything I own. say what you want to say, and hang for your hollow ways,. moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles....for me.. Your father made fetuses. With flesh licking ladies. While you and your mother. Were asleep in the trailer park. Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums. The music and medicine you needed for comforting. So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving. And pluck all your silly strings. And bend all your notes for me. Soft silly music is meaningful magical. The movements were beautiful. All in your ovaries. All of them milking with green fleshy flowers. While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines. Smelling of semen all under the garden. Was all you were needing when you still believed in me. And I know they buried her body with others. Her sister and mother and 500 families. And will she remember me 50 years later. I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine. Know all your enemies. We know who are enemies are. Goldaline my dear. We will fold and freeze together. Far away from here. There is sun and spring and green forever. But now we move to feel. For ourselves inside some stranger's stomach. Place your body here. Let your skin begin to blend itself with mine"
"holland, 1945","2,1,2,3,4.. The only girl I’ve ever loved. Was born with roses in her eyes,. But then they buried her alive one evening 1945 with just her sister at her side. And only weeks before the guns all came and rained on everyone,. Now she’s a little boy in Spain playing pianos filled with flames. On empty rings around the sun all sing to say my dream has come.. But now we must pick up every piece. Of the life we used to love. Just to keep ourselves at least enough to carry on.. And now we ride this circus wheel,. With your dark brother wrapped in white,. Says it was good to be alive,. But now he rides a comet’s flame and won’t be coming back again,. The Earth looks better from a star that’s right above from where you are,.

Of the life we used to love. Just to keep ourselves at least enough to carry on.. And here’s where your mother sleeps,. And here is the room where your brothers were born,. Indentions in the sheets,. Where their bodies once moved but don’t move any more.. And it’s so sad to see the world agree that they’d rather see their faces fill with flies,. All when I’d want to keep white roses in their eyes.."
a baby for pree,"Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen. Makes babies to breathe. With their hearts hanging open all over the sheets. As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer. And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing. They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating. Till wonderfully wet she will get. Until she's soaked inside her clothes. And there is no sorry to be sorry for. For a roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft. It made her swallow all her sweat. With every bit of breath she coughs. And when the day it came to pour all her babies. All across the bathroom floor. She will be swimming in them all forever more"
angel eyes,"Angel eyes. You will sleep tonight. But do not be surprised. When you’re not waking. You gave away your soul. And the rest, they stole. But now it’s your own life that you are taking.. And all the world will rise in the morning. A sun will shine inside a winter sky. But you won’t be around to see that dawning. Oh, your heart will take the wind. And I will, once again, say goodbye.. Sweet surprise,. Look into the night. For it will be the last. You’ll be receiving. And when at last you fly. And kiss this world goodbye. You’ll be in my mind when I am dreaming. And all the world will rise in the morning. A sun will shine inside a winter sky. But you won’t be around to see that dawning. Oh, your heart will take the wind. And I will, once again, say goodbye. Ohh, say goodbye… x3"
april 1st,(intrumental). Everywhere I go. Im swallowed up inside
april 8th,Crawl across towards your window. I'm calling softly from the street. Always a lonely widow. Half awake and sleeping on my feet. I'm of age but have no children. No quarter phone booth calls to home. Just late with television. Inside my bedroom all alone. There is no use in waiting. Offer up your steps so I can climb. Show me all your figure paintings. Etched in the middle of the night. Let me stretch upon your carpet. Let me hear the rain tap on your street. Knowing I am safe on the inside. Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep
arms so real,"I hold it into an arm so real. There is something we could feel. Life's not horrible all the time. Smokes and cups and words that rhyme. Dripping ceiling, lemon-lime,. I love you, that's all I have to say. Eyes of grey and pavement green. Wrap your arms around the seam. Take your love and hold it close. The slightest suggestion. Eyes of grey and pavement green. Wrap your arms around the scene. Take your love and hold it close. The slightest suggestion. Spinning slightly around. My head hits the ground. A seed pops out. Globes of thought, then descends on to you. With love. With love. With love. With love"
aunt eggma blowtorch,"This song was recorded in Jeff's bedroom in Louisiana. when he was 17 years of age. Some of the sounds featured. are his sister playing piano, his mother hearing. sounds from space, the baby brother of Will Cullen Hart talking, a blender,. and the music of Ornette Coleman."
biscuit,Your mother's mouth pressed. Gently against doorknobs. And there's so much fuckin' piss. Swimming into and out of the kitchen. Three feet up to the knees with cups. And carrot sticks from our warm. Golden glow of the refrigerator
bucket,Shadows on my wall. They creep and crawl in burning white. They dream of waterfalls. Catching slow bright streams of light.. And life can be so weird. Bucket full of fear. But it's alright. I'm on an isle. And i've still got time to fly away. Shadows in my dreams. They're painting scenes of time with you. I'm hoping all these things. and the strength they bring will pull me through. and life can be so weird. Bucket full of fear. But it's alright. i'm on an isle. And i've still got time to fly away.
circle of friends,Greet all your friends and they say hello. They tie all your ends until they tie. Yourself in again into something whole. Something secure and lost inside. I imply I'm away. All of the forces we uphold. And all of the dangers we escape. You wonder sometimes how long we'll hold. Till all of this anger shows its way. We embrace. Away. I'm OK. I'm OK. I'm OK. There are just some things we can't know. There are just some things you can't face. But I will secure myself in blue. and get this disease that you embrace. Embrace. and wait. Embrace. And wait. And beginning again takes so much time. And all of your friends come to watch you go. And as your machine pulls from the drive. You watch as their empty artics flow. Flow and blow. Flow away. Away. Away. I'm OK. I'm OK

So let’s sleep by the fire,. Of orange, apple, cinnamon.. Yes I know it’s hard to wait so long,. And you will be waiting.. I know it’s true,. A dead dog will reveal himself to you..

engine,For I am an engine and I'm holding on. The world is all bending and breaking from me. For sweetness alone who flew out through the window. And landed back home in a garden of green. You're riding alone in the back of a steamer. And steaming yourself in the warm shower spray. And water rolls on off the round captain's belly. Who's talking to tigers from his cafeteria tray. And sweet babies cry for the cool taste of milking. That milky delight that invited us all. And if there's a taste in this life more inviting. Then wake up your windows and watch as those sweet babies crawl away
everything is,"Grown sleepy as the rain falls. As children draped in flowers form a chain. They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls. As night falls into dust and it's day again. I'm not afraid of a love parade in my daydream. Old men with kazoos and beating drums. But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream. It's just you and me and oh dear, our life has just begun. Everything is beautiful here. It's spinning circles around my ears. I'm finally breaking free from fear. And it's fading. Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile. We could close the door and sleep all day. It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind. That's lost its feeling of so afraid. Everything is beautiful here. It's spinning circles around my ears. I'm finally breaking free from fear. And it's fading. Grown sleepy now as the rain falls. As children draped in flowers form a chain. They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls. As night falls into dust and it's day again. Everything is beautiful here. It's spinning circles around my ears. I'm finally breaking free from fear. And it's fading"
ferris wheel on fire,Well now first of all. We became what we always had feared. Every engine holds. All their oils on fire appeared. They finally broke through. And on your shoulder. This weight has been placed upon you. And everything we ever learned. Now I'm keeping stow. In someone's bright carnival ride. All the crowd just cheers. As the bolts break and metal collides. Spiraling through. And flying up all over the hills. And now everything's broken in two. And everything's way over. But now most of all. I am holding you under my skin. Watch these buildings fall. Watch as each weak resistance caves in. All over you all over. And now finally fading from view. Is everything we ever knew
follow me down,Follow me down. Strings of water plain. Eyes are underground. Wash the seed away. Hands are feathered drums that spin. Sound inside the quay. Follow me down. Follow me today. Found you wishing rainbows. Tasting words of wine. Felt just like a painting. Color stripping eye. The sun creeps through your window. And slowly fades away. Follow me down. Follow me today
gardenhead/ leave me alone,"There are beads that wrap. Around your knees that crackle into the dark. Like a walk in the park like a hole in your head. Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead. This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean. We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world. And I guess it's worth your time. Because there's some lives you live. And some you leave behind. It gets hard to explain. The gardenhead knows my name. Leave me alone, for you know this isn't the first time. In fact this is twice in a row. That the angels have slipped through our landslide. And filled up our garden with snow. And I don't wish to taste of your insides. Or to call out your name through my phone. For the glory boys at your bedside will love you. As long as you're something to own. Follow me through a city of frost covered angels. I swear I have nothing to prove. I just want to dance in your tangles. To give me some reason to move. But to take on the world at all angles. Requires a strength I can't use. So I'll meet you up high in your anger. Of all that is hoping and waiting for you."
ghost,"Ghost, ghost,. I know you were within me,. Feel as you fly. In from the clouds above the city. Into one that I. Loved with all that was left within me. Till we tore in two,. Now wings and rings,. And there’re so many waiting here for you.. And she was born in a bottle-rocket,. 1929,. With wings that ringed around a socket. Right between her spine. All drenched in milk in holy water pouring from the sky,. I know that she will live forever,. She won’t ever die,. She goes,. And now she knows she’ll never be afraid,. To watch the morning paper blow into a hole. where no-one can escape,. De, de, de…... And one day in New York City baby,. A girl fell from the sky,. From the top of a burning apartment building. fourteen stories high,. And when her spirit left her body,. How it split the sun!. I know that she will live forever. All goes on and on and on and. She goes,. And now she knows she’ll never be afraid. To watch the morning paper blow into a hole. where no-one can escape,. De, de, de.."
glue,"She comes to me. Whenever I am locked inside my room. Buried in the tune that I call love. She sings to me, the words I cannot hear. But then, the melody's so clear it makes me cry. Her love is so beautiful. Her love is so real, it smells like glue. She's leaving me to find a place she never will call home. I stand shaking like a stone. And smile inside. She's calling me to come to her and curl inside her womb. I hear lies, acid too. But I won't die, the pain is so beautiful. The urge is so real, it smells like glue. And I will scream, she hears me. I will tell myself she loves me. And all the lies and fears. Will stick to me like glue. And I will scream, she hears me. I will tell myself she loves me. And all the lies and fears. Will stick to me like glue"

And now I'm going down. And through the complications. Something inside me died. And now I'm going down. Bring down the sky with my tears. Dig up the earth with my hands. Take a look inside of my head. Maybe then you could understand. And in my celebration. You were by my side. And now I'm going down. And through the complications. Something inside me died. And now I'm going down. So long, again my friend. I guess its time I let you know. These things, they come around. I guess they just get hard to let them go. You wait around while. You'll never seem to find that faith in me. You close your eyes and smile. Forever I will be. I know the way and I will go. I know the way and I will find. It's all around me, and I told you so. It around and hear goodbye (All around in here, goodbye). And in my celebration. You were by my side. And now I'm going down. And through the complications. Something inside me died. And now I'm going down. And all the big decisions. We never could decide. And now I'm going down. And in my celebration. You were by my side. And now I'm going down"

home,Home - where you can hold your hands together all you please. Won't erase the tender tidings you endured. You're just another family member on their knees. Just a social work statistic out the door. They beat against the tender sidings of your soul. With all those pretty little hammers of control. Where they are tonight well you will never know. But I swear that I will find them now. More - it's more than just a simple question of decay. More than all those fists than beat into your door. It's more than all the shrinks that told you you're okay. It's more than anything that I have waited for. They beat against the tender sidings of your soul. With all those pretty little hammers of control. And if they even can remember I don't know. But I swear that they'll remember now. Home - it's just another word you'll always push away. Just a memory you wear outside your clothes. And it will burn down into cinders and some day. They will burrow down to their parental holes. They beat against the tender sidings of your soul. With all those pretty little hammers of control. And if they've ever paid a price well I don't know. But I swear that they will pay one now

i hear you breathe,"I hear you breathe as you sleep through the morning. And the sun cracks through winter’s wind. Screaming out an effervescent warning. That all that’s true is sure to end. But won’t you peel your pies to the TV screen. Won’t you read me your articles from your boring magazines. Which fill the spaces with your lipstick screams. Well that’s all you ever gave, that’s all you ever gave to me.. Sinking like a stone in the water all alone. You will not find me. Your reflection is the only sight you’ll see. A heart that has no memory. For all your tears they will drown you. And sink you for one million miles. And when the fear of life has finally found you. And crushes you inside the ocean tides. My ship will be sailing by"

I love how you love me. I love how your eyes close. Each time that you kiss me. And when I'm away from you. I love how you miss me. I love the way your kiss is always heavenly. But darling most of all. I love how you love me
i will bury you in time,I will bury you in time. When the sea begins to slide. Into this hole where I am smiling on your shoulder. You have buried my beliefs. Where all you sisters sleep. That there scent the purity will make. When the youth is over. Standing in some Oct - October. And I am breathing into you. It makes your features move. And they shimmer like balloons that fly above the ocean. All the world is waiting here. You can hear the children cheer. But they'll need you when you're near. The brink of complete implosion. Crown your king when your life is broken. Everything you are I'm tearing through. Everything you want I'm wanting too. I gave you more than I thought I could ever do. But I will never break you. And if I was the king of all the kids. You'd you hear me singing in my spit. But all you would hear is the shit inside my burnt emotions. I will bury you in time. When the sea begins to slide. Into this hole where you and I will sing our songs unbroken. As the water starts its chokin'. dee dee dee dee dee etc.

But for now we are young. Let us lay in the sun. And count every beautiful thing we can see. Love to be. In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me. Anna's ghost all around. Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me. Soft and sweet. How the notes all bend and reach above the trees. Now how I remember you. How I would push my fingers through. Your mouth to make those muscles move. That made your voice so smooth and sweet. And now we keep where we don't know. All secrets sleep in winter clothes. With one you loved so long ago. Now he don't even know his name. What a beautiful face. I have found in this place. That is circling all round the sun. And when we meet on a cloud. I'll be laughing out loud. I'll be laughing with everyone I see. Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all. . (fonte: site oficial)

life is neverending,"If i were a mirror. I'd look right deep inside myself. And if things were much clearer. I'd see a brighter day. And if you were my lover. I'd wrap your locks around my wrists. And shake beneath the shudders. That turn to black your face. For you know that life is neverending. Sometimes the miles seem to long to try. I've got a love. She is my anchor. She held me down. And saved my soul. So take the blood, and hate, and anger. And let it go. If i were the summer. I'd give my light to all the world. And wake you in your slumber. So you could see my eyes.

Sometimes the miles just seem to long to try. But i've got a love. She is my anchor. She held me down. And saved my soul. So take the blood, and hate, and anger. And let it go. If i were made of water. I'd slip my bones into the cracks. And freeze when it got colder. To hold the walls in true. And when it came to summer. I'd slip my soul into the yard. And give life to the flowers. That i never gave to you. But i know that life is neverending. Sometimes the miles can cut you down to size. But i had a love. She was my anchor. She held me down. And saved my soul. So take the blood you never gave her. And let it go"

Daddy come to touch me but he seen his hands are shaking. Look into my eyes and he could see their bodies breaking. Push me to the floor and in his hands I started beating. ""I don't want to hear it anymore"", he kept repeating. Do you really want the burning hell that we believe in?. Did you know the burning hell it took your baby brother?. Did you see how far he fell and how he made us suffer?. Another boy in town at night he took him for his lover. And deep in sin they held each other. So I took a hammer and nearly beat his little brains in. Knowing God in heaven could have, never could forgive him. So I took a hammer and I nearly beat his brains in. Little boy born without a father of a mother. Taken to the river and then pushed into the water. And the priests are singing that the hell is getting hotter. Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the only one to save him. From the thing he loves the most but we know will betray him. Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the only one to save him. From the thing he loves the most but we know will betray him. And here beneath the water I can see. How the lights distort so strange. And I think this is how I would like to leave my body.

All the words that I will utter. In hopes your love will soon discover. No one.. And I'm all screwed up. But I feel all right. Sinking deeper all the time. Inside a hole deep in my mind. But I love you, I love you…. More than life."
message sent,"Watch the wind, blow your cigarette smoke. Through my window and out to the sky. This message sent, drilled into your heart. And now the ink will fade before the night is through, I fear. Where were you when the cracks were forming?. Where were you when it all came down?. You were sleeping safe that morning. Holding insecurities that burrowed underneath your skin and fade away. All along, another twisted moment's gone. That will never pass this way again. And through it all, I thought there'd be some shred of hope. But faith, I've found, will do you in. And all the words that build up to. A bridge of hate between me and you. Will stumble, crack, and fail to fly. And now, my only one, where have you gone?. Are you another heart that I must say goodbye, my dear?. Where were you when the cracks were forming?. Where were you when it all came down?. You were sleeping safe that morning. Holding insecurities that burrowed. Goldaline, my dear, we will fold and freeze together. Far away from here, there is sun and spring and green forever. But now we move to feel for ourselves inside some stranger's stomach. Place your body here, let your skin begin to blend itself with mine. Waits for all the day. Don't you ever leave me. All the dreams that I -. Don't you ever leave"
my dreamgirl,"My dreamgirl don't exist. At the age of five she slit her wrist. She didn't know that I'd be hanging around. So her parents buried her in the ground. And this day I can still hear the sound. Of a life in outerspace. My dreamgirl don't exist. Just you and I and this TV. And this illness seems to feel so strange. Like a henchman that's about to hang. The moon up like a ball and chain. And set the sands ablaze. And the weight is waiting, ah. Feel the world so real and strong. My dreamgirl don't exist. Took her photograph from a history book. I believe she had a voice and name. Three children on the coast of maine. Her life was in a hurricane. Of love and real embrace. My dreamgirl dont exist. At the age of five she slit her wrist. She didnt know that I'd be hanging around. So one day she took a stroll to town. And walked in front of a greyhound bound. For New York central state. And the weight is waiting, oh. And the weight is waiting, oh. Feel the world so real and strong. She goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid"
naomi,"Your prettiness is seeping through. Out from the dress I took from you, so pretty. And my emptiness is swollen shut always. Always a wretch i have become. So empty. And please please dont leave me. I'm watching Naomi, full bloom. I'm hoping she will soon explode. Into one billion tastes and tunes. One billion angels come and hold her down. They hold her down until she shines. I'm tasting Naomi's perfume. It tastes like shit and I must say. She comes and goes most afternoons. One billion lovers wave and love her now. They could love her now and so could I. There is no Naomi in view. She walks through Cambridge stocks and strolls. And if she only really knew. One billion angels could come and save her soul. They could save her soul until she shines. So pretty. And please, please don't leave me here.."
now i'm going down,"I crush the world I was in. I'll destroy the world I will find. I'll work the tools with my hands. I'll stick the needles in my eyes. And in my celebrations. You were by my side. And now I'm going down. And through the complications. Something inside me died. And now I'm going down. Bring down the sky with my tears. Dig up the earth with my hands. Take a look inside of my head. And maybe then you could understand. And in my celebrations. You were by my side. And now I'm going down. And through the complications. Something inside me died. And now I'm going down. So long I get my friend back. I guess it's time I should let you know. Well, these things they come around. I guess it's just too hard to let them go. You wait around and while you never. Seem to find that faith in me. You close your eyes and smile. ""Forever I will be"". Well, I know the way and I will go. I know the way and I will find. It's all around me and I told you so. All around in here, goodbye. And in my celebrations. You were by my side. And now I'm going down. And through the complications. Something inside me died. And now I'm going down. And all the big decisions we never could decide. And now I'm going down. And in my celebrations. You were by my side. And now I'm going down"
oh comely,"Oh comely. I will be with you when you lose your breath. Chasing the only meaningful memory you thought you had left. With some pretty bright and bubbly terrible scene. That was doing her thing on your chest. But oh comely. It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess. in your memory, you're drunk on your autumn. it doesn't mean anything at all. Oh comely. All of your friends are letting you blow. Bristling and ugly. Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes. Of some pretty bright and bubbly friend. You could need to say comforting things in your ear. But oh comely. There isn't such one friend that you could find here. Standing next to me. He's only my enemy. I'll crush him with everything I own. say what you want to say, and hang for your hollow ways,. moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles....for me.. Your father made fetuses. With flesh licking ladies. While you and your mother. Were asleep in the trailer park. Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums. The music and medicine you needed for comforting. So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving. And pluck all your silly strings. And bend all your notes for me. Soft silly music is meaningful magical. The movements were beautiful. All in your ovaries. All of them milking with green fleshy flowers. While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines. Smelling of semen all under the garden. Was all you were needing when you still believed in me. And I know they buried her body with others. Her sister and mother and 500 families. And will she remember me 50 years later. I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine. Know all your enemies. We know who are enemies are. Goldaline my dear. We will fold and freeze together. Far away from here. There is sun and spring and green forever. But now we move to feel. For ourselves inside some stranger's stomach. Place your body here. Let your skin begin to blend itself with mine"
oh sister,"Oh sister, don't be afraid of me. I won't be nailing you down in the nursery. Just like the rest of them did. With those watery, wandering fingers that slipped. That were supposed to be glorious and fine.. Oh sister won't you believe in me. I only wanted to be hard on the family. Here with you now in this silly infirmary. Your mother makes frantic and drunk calls. From Germany all of the time.. Oh sister, sweet brown and beulahery. And milk from your blisters on your grandmother's jewelry. There in the parlor all naked in front of me. Watching the lights from the cracks. Making archery animal designs.. Rose Wallace Goldeline just moves her mouth over anything. Fleshy free and flowering with oranges out in the open. But don't you waste your sins again. She don't need you or won't fuck your friends. And you, you're American, so important boiling over. To prove that she must still exist. she moves herself about her fist. and never ever gave a shit. about all those words you're wasting again. Some pretty bright and bubbly wondrous dream. you'd like to kill and claim. And claim her as your own. But don't you worry. All those dainty and dirty emotions. just go away and fade out on their own. Sister, now that we're grieving. Our fingers will falter. Our lungs will be leaking. All over each other and without even speaking. We'll know that it's over and smile and go greeting. Whatever comes next. And oh sister. You're getting married with some angry twister. That you'll have to carry home. drunk every evening from the cemetery. And if he makes it back half alive you can. bury him under your sheets. And oh sister. now that you're leaving. I can not imagine there is any meaning. forgetting you ever could once had the feeling that made you keep on. And pretend you were breathing of all of this world. In an age of empty rings. I don't want to feel the thing. I don't even want to know. and Rose Wallace Goldeline. don't you ever die on me. all the way it goes."

rubby bulbs,I need to taste your voice in my mouth. I need to taste your voice in the air. And I need to feel your skin against all that I retch out. And feel your voice all over everywhere. I need to paste your skin around the mailbox. And hold the postman in your smile. I need to fill your lungs with smallpox. And fill the glow of a sick and distorted life. Beautiful baby. All filled with angels. Beautiful baby. All filled with angels. Beautiful baby. All filled with angels. Beautiful babies. All filled with angels
sailing through,"Sailing through your disease and you. Your disease and you. Your body's like a basket. Shivering in static. Ride this phase of angry tears.

You are a liar. You are a liar. And you are a lie. You are a liar. You are a liar. Now I'm off sailing. Sickness impaling. Every drop of blood you could bleed. The world is all coming.

she did a lot of acid,"She had a mental problem. She couldn't concentrate. She was her own delusion. She was her own mistake. She did a lot of acid. That put the voices down. And one day at her birthday. They found her hanging upside down. They say she lived her life on the avenue. They say she cried from the weight of her spit. They claim they were the only ones that she ever knew. Ah, but why are they weeping now?. When she was alive they were not around. They were locked in their own abyss. We met in the gutter. We shared a smoke or two. I told about my mother. She showed me her tattoo. She went out through the city. Got lost in Fulton Town (?). And one day at her birthday. They found her hanging upside down. They say she live her life an American. They say she whored away but still. They claim they offered her their helping hand. But the talk's all the same to me. They call themselves her family. It just makes me ill"

Sinking ship how long can you hold still your illness is all that you are. A portrait of my father as a baby sleeping underneath the stars. A small pill of forgiveness I am giving to myself, it's what I need. A small gift of fufillment I am hoping you will open and recieve. ooooh. ooooh. ooooooooh. Sinking ship how long can you hold still your illness fills this empty mirror. A portrait of you lover softly drowning in the warm waters of June. A perfect Sunday portrait of my mother sending signals through the drums. A portrait of my sadness finding shelter in the safety of my home. ooooh. ooooh. ooooooooh"

C'mon smile. Yes c'mon smile. (kick it)
snow song pt. 1,"Cindy smiles in overcoats. She says, ""Please stay awhile, like ice cream floats and dreams. And I will fill your heart with boats and bells and beans and candy-appled. Everythings. Bells and beans and candy-appled everythings..."". Cindy skips my trampoline. With toys and horns and bouncing things. And even the most silent must sing a song. Yes, even the silent they must sing a song of love. oh, oh. Unhappy girl, she's spinning. Through strings in her curls. And it's only the beginning. Of a trip around the world. Cindy won't you smile. Cindy won't you sleep awhile. I feel I'm just a child. Sinking down one hundred million miles. oh, oh"
someone is waiting,Someone is waiting to swallow all the halos out of you. As your face blows through my windows. Sending pieces flying all around my room. And I love you and I want to.

song against sex,"And the first one tore a picture. of a dead and hanging man. who was kissing foreign fishes. that flew right out from his hands. and when I put my arms around him. felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks. and an eerieness surrounded. when his tongue began to speak. and he said, ""oh, boy, you are so pretty,. enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string"". and when I finally kissed him. the whole world began to ring. lost like a bell that's tipping over. with two cracks along both sides. and I knew the world was over. so I took a look outside. and watched the fires that were reaching. up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees. and the waiting scene and the Sunday dream. they're all waiting here for me. Deli markets with their flower stands. and pretty girls and the burning men. hanging out on the hooks. next to window displays. and I took out my tongue. twice removed from my face. across a bridge and across the mountains. threw a nickel in the fountain. to save my soul from all these troubled times. and all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take. to soothe my mind so I'm always sober. always aching, always heading towards. mass suicide, occult figurines. and wasted gas-station attendants. attending to their jobs. and a nice drive in the country. finds a nice cliff to drop off. oh, when this life just gets so grating. all the grittiness of life. but don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you. you're too wonderful to die. And the last one tore a picture. from the pornographic page. and all the pleasure points attacking. all the looks of love were staged. and it's a lie that you've been given. that just hurts you every day. so why should I lie here naked. when it's just too far away. from anything we could call loving. any love worth living for. so I'll sleep out in the gutter. you can sleep here on the floor. and when I wake up in the morning. don't forget to lock the door. 'cos with a match that's mean and some gasoline. you won't see me anymore.."

sweet marie,"Everything is made of water. Seeping deep within your soul. And as you’re sleeping safe tomorrow. The flowers in your heart will overflow. Sweet Marie with your raspberry sunshine. Won’t you take me where I’ve never known. I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you. Like the weeds grow in my mind. I know you, know you like the wind as it's blown. Everything is made of water. Seeping deep within your soul. And as you’re sleeping safe tomorrow. The flowers in your heart will overflow. Dream of me when the day sings of sunshine. Dream of me when your lucks gone away. I’ll show you, show you, show you, show you, show you. How the snow falls in your mind. I know you, know you’re gonna find it some day. Everything is made of water. Seeping deep within your soul. And as you’re sleeping safe tomorrow. The flowers in your heart will overflow. The fall is not as hard as they told you so. A love will soon define a place to grow. Lonely child of dreams. Won’t you ever dream of me. Won’t you love me like a ship. Setting sail upon the sea. And don’t you ever feel afraid. Of falling like a hate parade. Hoping someone will love you. Someone will love you soon. Lonely child of eyes. Won’t you ever follow me. Into an evening sky. Into a make believe. Where hands they hold on true. And flowers blow tiny balloons. And no ones lonely. When no one is an only one. The sun will fall. The day will fade. And I will join the hate parade. And I will love a heart untrue. That's slipping softly from my room"
synthetic flying machine,Up and over. We go through the waving undertow. I will float until I learn how to swim. Inside my mother in a garbage bin. Until I find myself again. Again. Up and over. We go mouths open wide and spilling snow. I will spit until I learn how to speak. Up through the doorway as the sideboards creak. With them ever proclaiming me. Me. Up and over. Eyes open wide into down below. I will shout until they know what I mean. I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing. And a synthetic flying machine. Machine. Ok
the gifted children,Close to me you are. We are boiled in milk. Neutrals in the acid house. Curdled in chaos. At least we can see who we are. Not like those gone for the gold. We are boiled in milk. Let us soothe your open wounds. Dry your crying eyes. Let us soothe your open wounds. Dry your crying eyes. Let us soothe your open wounds. Dry your crying eyes. Dry your crying eyes
the king of carrot flowers part one,"When you were young you were the King of carrot flowers,. And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees,. In holy rattlesnakes that fell all round your feet.. And your Mum would stick a fork right into Daddy’s shoulder,. And Dad would throw the garbage all across the floor,. As we would lay and learn what each other’s bodies were for.. And this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you,. And from above you how I sank into your soul,. Into that secret place where no-one dares to go.. And your mum would drink until she was no longer speaking,. And Dad would dream of all the different ways to die,. Each one a little more than he could dare to try…."

Inside my mother in a garbage bin,. until I find myself again,. Again, oh.. All I know. We go mouths open wide and spit in stuff. I will spit until I learn how to speak. Up through the doorway as the sideboards creak. With them ever proclaiming me, me, oh. All I know. We go the way the steps fell down and I don’t know,. I will shout until they know what I mean,. I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing. And a synthetic flying machine, machine, oh.. Ok.."
three peaches,So wake up run your lips across your fingers till you find. Some scent of yourself that you can hold up high. To remind yourself that you didn't die. On a day that was so crappy whole and happy you're alive. You're in the bathroom carving holiday designs into yourself. Hoping noone will find you but they found you. And they took you. And you somehow survived. So wake up and if the holidays don't hollow out your eyes. Then press yourself against whatever. You find to be beautiful and trembling with life. Because I'm so happy you didn't die

where you will find me now,"All I perceive is wasted and broken. Silvery streams, sacred when spoken. Slam into me and into the ditch of debris. And you smoke in the park and sleep in the greenery.

With my army and my enemies taking hold. Take off your clothes for the time has come for sleeping. Cause everybody know the world continues though. Whether or not you're still breathing"

You paint the doors and walls and listen for the bell-chime calls. And life is nothing more at all than tea-cup drips and bouncing balls. And oh, it's real and never fading. I'll listen to the strings you strum and all the words you're saying now. Ooh, sing a song. A song with feeling. That sounds best when you've hit the bong. And concludes deeper meaning, but oh. 'cause i know sometimes. All the thoughts can sometimes hit. Confusion as the record skips. But who are these fools that think you're hip. When all the world is full of shit. And oh, i hear the tunes you're playing. It splits inside the summer sky. It's softly cascading on"
world of wild beards story,"Walking Wall of Beards Incorporated was a company that existed in the early 1900s in America where they would make these sound devices which were pleasing to beard hair and pubic hair,. but they were inaudible to the human ear.. And if you bought one and you turned it on in your house and all the pubic hair in your house and if you lived near a barber shop you were really doing good,. all the hair that was laying around would form walls and walk around. So if you were living,. like say in Philadelphia in the 1900s,. it wouldn't be unusual to see a wall of hair walking around. And we wanted to do this post nervous breakdown gig in tribute to that company that was thousands of years ahead of it's time.. And one day we will all look like fools for not having beard walls to walk around with.. Cause in the future it's gonna be really hip.. Well anyway I just wanted to explain that."
you've passed,The lady is dying. She bends back like a wave. As her spirit is climbing. Through the hospital wall and away. And I wanted to hold you. As you made your escape.

Oh please oh don't go away. I wanted to know you. Before you started to fade. But I gave everything to. A lie and a farce and a fake
