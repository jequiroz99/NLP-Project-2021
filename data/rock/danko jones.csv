lovercall,"Every 45 seconds a woman is raped. Our sexist culture allows no escape. The is violent crime is far from obscurity. When the rate of victims is one in three. Society conditions men to be rapists. And our indifference perpetuates it. With derogatory language that tends to dehumanize. Making it easier for men to victimize. And the pornographic images that help portray. Women as legitimate sexual prey. When sexism is embedded in our judicial system. It's no surprise why the courts won't listen. And the role of attacker and survivor become distorted. So the majority of rapes are never reported. The threat of rape is always there. It's like a poison that saturates the air. A society stricken by a cancerous disease. Where men know they can do as they please. You tell me the punishment for rape. You tell me how much jail time it will take. When one out of three women will be raped. You tell me what it's going to fucking take. Do you see me in my low cut shirt. Or high heel shoes or a miniskirt. Woman is the victim you desire. You say you can't resist your predatory fire. You tell me why I stand guilty and accused. You tell me when I'm beaten an abused. When it's my body that's been raped and defiled. You tell me why I'm the one on trial. Defense attorney?: Do you know the man who. ""allegedly"" attacked you?. Victim?: Yes I know the man who raped me.. Defense attorney?: And isn't this man a friend of. yours?. Victim?: Well I thought he was a friend of mine.. Defense attorney?: And were you drinking that night he. 'allegedly"" attacked you?. Victim?: I had a drink or two but is that a crime?. Defense attorney?: I'll ask the questions if you don't. mind!. -What were you wearing: How did you act?. Victim?: My wardrobe isn't an invitation for a man to. attack.. -I didn't act in any way to bring this on. Why am I on. trail? What did I do wrong?. Defense attorney?: Could you tell the jury why you let. this happen?. Victim?: I was in shock. I couldn't stop him.. Defense attorney?: You claim that you were raped but. how do we know?. Victim?: I said no, I said no, no, no!. Defense attorney?: Isn't it true you're just a woman. scorned?. Victim?: I'm a woman who's been raped and torn.. Defense attorney?: Your honor, I demand that this case. be dismissed,. -it all comes down to her word against his!. I may not have bruises all over my body. But when I went to his room I never would have guessed. That he would force my no to mean a yes. You tell me why I'm guilty of this crime. You tell me why the responsibility is mine. When women suffer a second rape during trial. Courts help rapists to violate and defile"

sticky situation,So you got dumped on your rump. Not surprised you had nothing to say. To your friends the night before your birthday. But you got up and took control of the situation. Got it then he wants you back without an explanation. You change your style. You change your hair. Your jeans got tighter. Now people stare. He bites his hand and doesn't stop thinking about you. He asks a friend to ask you out now what do you do?. You know that he wants you but you don't want him anymore. This is this is this is a sticky situation [x4]. Well you caught her in the act with 'a Brad' from your work station. You used a baseball bat and now it's into litigation. But you stood up cooled off and walked away despite your temper. Now she's calling you from January to December. You let it slide. You played it cool. And now she calls you. But you're no fool. She's not even worth the time but I think you know this. And she can have all the boys that are on the checklist. You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore. This is this is this is a sticky situation [x4]. [Repeat]. Woo. Don't get stuck!. It's that girl that you let go the one that doesn't get the picture. Because you left her right wanting to get back together. But you moved on found another and it leaves no question. She cries to her friends just to get attention. She puts you down. But you let her. You're feeling guilty. She's feeling better. But when she sees you. With another. She tears her heart out. You can't be bothered. This is this is this is a sticky situation [x4]. You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore. This is this is this is a sticky situation !. You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore. This is this is this is a sticky situation. You know that she wants you but you don't want her anymore..

terrified,I'm terrified - of your eyes. They can be so cold. I lie at night - waiting tight. For the bell to toll. Therein lies - what I know. That'll make us fold. I realize - that our time. Is just growing old. And every day it may feel. Like we're getting close. But the rug under us. Always getting pulled. I'm terrified - of the lies. That you holding close. I can feel - that the seal's already broke. And when it's finally time. And you need to go. I'll be there unprepared. Holding on to hope. And every day it may feel. Like we're getting close. But the rug under us. Always getting pulled. It's a sign that our time with each. Others's over. I'm terrified - I'm terrified of you. I know that everything has to expire. You know this too. Like needles wanting to pierce. Through my eyes. Always cruel. I'm terrified - of your eyes. They can be so cold. I'm terrifed - of the lies. That you holding close. I'm numb to you. And every day it may feel. Like we're getting close. I'm terrified. I'm terrified of you

Your tears, my smile!. You cry! Like a five-year-old child/ at the drop of a dime. I see the welling in your eyes. You cheat! You're cheating on repeat/ you're hollow on the inside/ but you think you've got it beat. I've never met somebody/ with so much hate I'm sorry/ but you're just spoiled and rotten/ and will be soon forgotten/ until that day:. Your tears, my smile!. Your tears, my smile!. You lie! The truth always alludes you/ No one does it better/ you'll say anything you need to. You know! You know exactly what you're doing/ more than anyone else you hate yourself and sit there brooding. I found you to be vacant/ you tantrums escalated/ your sulking and self-loathing got tired and annoying. Been pampered all your life but words can't cut like a knife and when they do:. Your tears, my smile!. Your tears, my smile!. Your tears, my smile!. Your tears, my smile!"
