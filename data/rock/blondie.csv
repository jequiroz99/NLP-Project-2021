And he shoots you dead and he eats your head. And then you're in the man from Mars. You go out at night eating cars. You eat Cadillacs Lincolns too. Mercurys and Subaru. And you don't stop. You keep on eating cars. Then when there's no more cars you go out at night. And eat up bars where the people meet. Face to face. Dance cheek to cheek. One to one. Man to man. Dance toe to toe. Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars is through with cars. He's eating bars. Yeah wall to wall. Door to door. Hall to hall. He's gonna eat 'em all. Rapture. Be pure.

dreaming,"When I met you in the restaurant. You could tell I was no debutante. You asked me what's my pleasure,. ""A movie or a measure""?. I'll have a cup of tea. and tell you of my dreaming. Dreaming is free. I don't want to live on charity. Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?. Reel to reel is living rarity. People stop and stare at me,. we just walk on by;. we just keep on dreaming. Feet feet: walking a two mile. Meet meet: meet me at the turnstile. I never met him, I'll never forget him. Dream dream: even for a little while. Dream dream: filling up an idle hour. Fade away, radiate. I sit by and watch the river flow. I sit by and watch the traffic go. Imagine something of your very own;. something you can have and hold. I'd build a road in gold. just to have some dreaming. Dreaming is free"

double take,"Looking for your face where it could never be.. I'm following a trail that only I can see.. Raising waves of heat.. I press on in tiny bursts of speed.. Caught in my pursuit, I play the fetishist admission.. The longing that I feel drives me mad in no direction.. Nailed by something cute, I tear it out with microsurgical precision.. Incender.. Put some gas on the ember.. Lightning goes to ground.. Incender.. Crazy fool on a bender.. Striking the ground.. Burning me down.. Double take.. Left with an aftertaste.. I look again.. Was it your face?. Double take.. I'm in an altered state.. I look again.. Was it really you?. Another flash of face, igniting and familiar pulls me by the eye to the perimiter.. Riviting my gaze.. Is that your face in the crowd?. Incender.. Drop some gas on the ember.. I felt a slap on the face.. Incender.. Crazy fool on a bender.. Striking the ground, burning me down.. Double take.. Left with an aftertaste.. I look again.. Was it your face?. I fell awake.. I'm in an altered state.. I look again.. Was it really you?. Double take.. Left with an aftertaste.. I look again..

dragonfly,"""Greetings, Ladies and Gentlemen of Earth. and all native intelligences of the forty planets. (,satellites, moons, stars, and any other inhabited orbs). with contestants entered in the annual Grande Trex,. the only inter-universal race.. This year's event promises excitement to surpass all previous races!. As many of you fans know already the route or track of the race,. orbits, and glides has been increased by 5000 million kilometers. thus enabling Grande Trex to include the B'Arc 15 system. (in our present event and for all succeeding GT races)!"". Dragonfly * Dragonfly * Satellite * Strike and fight. Laser light * Shot tonight * Target nullified * Gyro subdivide. Lattitude * Longitude * Satellite * Solid substitute. Dragonfly * Arc revise. What's a drag race?. Can't you see those dragons speeding up the street?. But I learned they weren't real.. Figments of the ancient's fear.. Rapid scan * Radians * For the chance * To win the grande. Maneuvers * Preprogram * Windage * Won't operate. Negative * Bearing swell. Dragons fly, they symbolize in myth and saga breathing fire.. Look up there's one flying higher!. Faster than the SSC.. Is science hiding witchery?. ""Grande Trex fans throughout the universe are well informed on the risks the pilots take in entering this race; re-entry into some of the alien atmospheres is tricky business which can cause a craft to implode, explode, melt, lose atomic structure, and so forth, adding to the interstellar degree that on its own is a terrific danger to the ships (while) en route. The surface craft scheduled to launch at 0700.51(00) Greenwich mean time have assembled on one of our very own stars (Neutron Einstar EV 9) for this year's event. And the excitement is at a fevering pitch as the countdown approaches zero!"". Dragonfly * Rations glide * In free fall slide * Systems nullify. Satellite * Dragonfly * Surface launch * Radio silence. Hover high * Level off. The time space tactics saved us then.. Display report. Present urgent.. Sequence counting surface launch.. Dragonfly destroying all.. Science claiming newest findings.. Chanting calling flying dragons.. Aboard all systems optimum.. Nova scheduled, war continued.. Half the continental shelf burned by interval.. Interval.. ""We have retained as an added feature of daring, thrills, and excitement of this race, a feature which I'm sure you're going to like, the computer override lasting three and a half hours or two gens, when pilots and co-pilots manually control free-fall, latitude, logitude, protract gravity, revise dimensional equations, run program checks, submerge in the wild oceans of Jonrin 22, and photograph as much territory and terrain as they can in addition to the requisite three thousand automatic shots. The postulate for mischance runs high but not as high as the tension and competitive spirit right here (on Earth) and all over the (4) galaxies (represented in this Seventh Grande Trex)."". Dragonfly * Dragonfly * Beacons aim * Space game. ""The countdown is -200 and I am turning you over to the control room at command central (Sia Lan) for the launch. Good luck to all the entrants and especially to our own ship, (the) Dragonfly! (Onward to victory! (Remember comdirect and radio silence will temporarily be in effect.))"".

dreaming,"When I met you in the restaurant. You could tell I was no debutante. You asked me what's my pleasure,. ""A movie or a measure""?. I'll have a cup of tea. and tell you of my dreaming. Dreaming is free. I don't want to live on charity. Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?. Reel to reel is living rarity. People stop and stare at me,. we just walk on by;. we just keep on dreaming. Feet feet: walking a two mile. Meet meet: meet me at the turnstile. I never met him, I'll never forget him. Dream dream: even for a little while. Dream dream: filling up an idle hour. Fade away, radiate. I sit by and watch the river flow. I sit by and watch the traffic go. Imagine something of your very own;. something you can have and hold. I'd build a road in gold. just to have some dreaming. Dreaming is free"

end of the world,"Fainting from hunger. Fallen by fear. Blood on the sidewalk. Staining the rest of the year. Talking to the voices you hear. No more companion. Alone in the sky. An older invention. Comes from a native reply. Raised by a shout and a cry. And I listen to this. To this voice out of pitch. The excitement or the panic of girls. And all that I heard had its own kind of reason. Was it really the end of the world?. I know you feel guilty and it's driving you wild. But the weight you've been shedding is heading to the critical side. Avanishing act just to hide. How else can I put it?. What more can I say?. An ounce of truth diminishes everything that you said. It's your turn to put things away. He told me he talks to the buildings. He told me he speaks to the sky. Once he conversed with a road full of holes. While he whispered his little white lies. And I listen to this. To this voice out of pitch. The excitement or the panic of girls. And all that I heard had its own kind of reason. Was it really the end of the world?. You love the lightning, thunder and all. Talk to the pavement. Listen to the will and the call. Voices come out of the wall. Some other surface. Standing alone. Points of remembrance only help sharpen the tone. Sharpen right down to the bone. He told me he talks to the buildings. He told me he speaks to the sky. Once he conversed with a road full of holes. While he whispered his little white lies. And I listen to this. To this voice out of pitch. The excitement or the panic of girls. And all that I heard had its own kind of reason. Was it really the end of the world?. Was it really the end of the world?"
end to end,Just when our number's up. You smashed the loving cup. It spills out everywhere. It simply isn't fair. We light up fire flies. We kissed on New Years Night. We changed the century. All those romantic things. We changed the light to low. It made our spirits glow. If it were up to me. I'd never let you go. So If By Chance. You Should agree. Ohh tonight. We keep it Real. Toinght. We put an End to the End. And just go on and on. We wrote our name in lights. Made music every night. Heatwaves and rhapsody. Burn In my memory. We changed the light to low. It made our spirits glow.

english boys,"When I was 17 I saw a magazine.. It had those English boys who had long hair.. When I was on my own they moved into my town,. and I just called 'em up and they'd be there.. In 1969 I had a lousy time.. I listened to the songs, read letters sent from Nam.. Now peace and love were gone, the tired soldiers home.. Ideal society gunned down the 70's.. Does it feel the same to you?. Why do you act the way you do?. Pack it up or pack it in.. There's no excuse.. Could the hands of time reverse?. Would we wake or take the ride. and again speak with one voice?. We knew each other well although we never met.. Messages passed to tell equal respect.. Coincidence recurred.. I had to laugh a lot.. One week hung up superb, said maybe not."
europa,"Based on the desire for total mobility. and the serious physical pursuit of religious freedom,. the auto drove mankind further than the wheel and,. in remote areas even today,. is forbidden as a device too suspect for human conveyance.. This articulate conception has only brought us all more of the same,. thoughtlessly locked into phase two gridlock, keyed up,. on it's rims,and abandoned on the expressway."
faces,"Faces cracked for reason beyond recognition.. His space is at the Palace.. He sleeps for twenty five cents.. Now he's wiping headlights, windshields with an old rag.. It ain't nine to five.. Down and dirty, he's an old tramp.. He poses like a dead man.. The night train passes by.. Money's not the answer for princes and dancers.. He's standing under street lights.. He's thinking of his old life.. He lost his pretty young wife.. The corner is his big plan.. His brunch with Jim and jitters.. Boston blue laws ain't for shitters.. And newsprint is for cheaters.. Cement mattress for believers.. Now he's shooting power curves.. His buddies think he's got some nerve.. Missus Face had other lovers.. Her arms smothered other numbers.. He freezes.. Christmas season, all Saints protect him.. His face is cracked for reason beyond recognition."
fade away and radiate,"Ooh baby, I hear how you spend nighttime. Wrapped like candy in a blue blue neon glow.. Fade away and radiate.. Ooh baby, watchful lines vibrate soft in brainwave time.. Silver pictures move so slow.. Golden tubes faintly glow.. Electric faces seem to merge.. Hidden voices mock your words.. The beams become my dream.. My dream is on the screen.. Dusty frames that still arrive die in 1955."
fan mail,"Fan Mail. I set my hand to writing you... it drifted off the page.. I sold my one vision for a piece of the cake.... I haven't ate in days.. For unspoken value, aesthetic, and charm,. I'd smile at you sideways,. But the lighting is wrong.. I'm taking a picture, and counting the cost,. while the bells in my ears keep ringing.. I set my hand to writing you... it drifted of the page.. I nearly fell, I feel like a lowlife in hell. and I haven't slept in days and days, days and days.... Beat on my Fender through my Gemini 2,. play to the posters on the wall of my room.. Thought I was crazy when I'd think about you.... And the bells in my ears keep ringing.. And the bells in my ears keep ringing.. In my ear bells are ringing."
fine day (curse of blondie outtake),"Clear for miles is all I see when the world is laid out just for me. In my bubble in the sky no one ever sees me cry. On my left my path looks bright. It doesn't matter now, anyway. It'll be alright. On such a fine. On such a fine day. I think that I could just fly away. On such a fine day"
follow me,"Far from day, far from night. Out of time, out of sight. In between earth and sea. We shall fly, follow me. Dry the rain, warm the snow. Where the winds never go. Follow me, follow me. Follow me. Follow me to a cave by a sapphire shore. Where we'll walk through. an emerald door. And for thousands of. breathless ""evermore's"" my. life you will be. Only you, only I. World farewell, world goodbye. To our home 'neath the sea. We shall fly, follow me. Only you, only I. World farewell, world goodbye. To our home 'neath the sea. We shall fly, follow me. Follow me, follow me. Follow me, follow me"
for your eyes only,"Don't look over my shoulder, I'm trying to read.. Remember these intimate moments; don't forget my privacy.. We both have our orders and a trick up the sleeve.. There's no use pretending you're asleep.... The subject was roses: quine geology.. Deliberate notice you're taking of me.. Caution and danger are not family.. Don't try turning the tables on me!. Too long and too lonely.... For your eyes only, secretly.. Enjoy the paradox: you thinking I'm the fox.. Can't ya see you personally?. So many people know who you are. and they know you've been looking for your counterpart.. We're chasing an echo in sonic 3-D. and if I laugh without joking, make believe.. Too long and too lonely.... For your eyes only, totally.. I like what you're showing.. For your eyes only, secretly.. For your eyes only."
forgive and forget,"In the beginning, in the days before time, the light was alive with the essense of power.. And from that power were born beings who lived on the edge of eternity.. And they spread their wings and soared through the ancient air.. And the beating of their wings made the winds.. And from the winds came the seas.. And from the sea came the life of the earth.. Nature's cast upon the sea the winds of past, of promise be.. Waters deep uncover me.. A scheme of sleep as lovers three.. If you'll forgive me my ferocity, I won't forget your sweetness.. Pull down the night, lay it before me.. Gratify my head with curses.. Night recalls tranquility.. A curtain falls and sets it free.. Darkness calls eternity.. Down silent halls the shadows flee.. If you'll forgive me my ferocity, I won't forget your sweetness.. Pull down the night, lay it before me.. Satisfy my head with curses.. Forgive and forget.. Forgive and forget.. Forgive and forget.. Fates are cast upon the sea.. The winds of past of promise be.. Waters deep uncover me.. A scheme of sleep as lovers three.. Forgive and forget.. Forgive and forget.."
fragments,"You can't create more time, you just make it. If you want a new life, just take it. And if you wanna change the world then speak real clear. And make sure someone's listening, listening. And if you wanna break my heart then stay right here. Yeah, don't go anywhere. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Everything comes in pieces. Do you love me yet? Fucking prove it. Try to ask yourself; are you really different?. Know that your life is more frightening than writing a song. It's an action of fractions you're passing along. And these oceans of emotion will crash. once they hit the shore, I promise you. And it's the closest I will get to sincerity. The praise I make just looks so fake and cruel to me. And it's the closest I will come to purity. Simulations never follow me. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. My heart is made up of pieces. Do you get it yet? Can you see through this?. You know all too well you cannot make things perfect. No, I'll be shifting through lists of these possible loves. With this pain in my brain it feels scattered like doves. Through this sky where my eyes. have been drifting towards recently. And it's the closest I can be to egocentricity. This overwhelming sense of rejection. will sneak up behind and tear at me. And it'll slam me to the ground into reality. And I'll deal with my disparity. Oh, do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Do you love me now?. Why don't you love me now?. Why don't you love me now?. This is where I fall down, shattered on the floor. As I'm swept along with a million pieces more. Of myself I once learned to lose. Though it never helped me forget. The truth, the truth, oh, the truth, the truth. This is where I fall down, shattered on the floor. As I'm swept along with a million pieces more. Of myself I once learned to lose. Though it never helped me forget. The truth, the truth, oh, the truth, the truth"

We'll walk and talk years of. Before the light begins to show. Let's wake the roosters. Nice to know you Joe. Let's wake the roosters. Hey-ho olÃ¡ Joe.
here's looking at you,"As I sit staring into this liquid amber, ripples move out to the edge of the glass.. Is that really your reflection in there?. I just wanna jump into the warm depths and be there with you, one more time!. Oh, alright.. Hit it boys!. My initials sprayed across a pavement cut into your private interview.. Talk to me now.. Step into my room, we'll have a word or two.. If I ever had a million dollars and if I didn't give it all to you would you lose interest?. Show me indifference?. Foot in another shoe?. Not very high heels.. Not wearing sneakers too.. A magazine ad, a printed canvas, a basic new shade blue suede shoe.. Thought I'd like to have a little party.. Thought I'd like to have a little do.. Sure I stopped drinking but for the moment, honey, here's looking at you!. I'll stop my drinking (give you my promise true), clean out the closet, be existential, and cast a vote for the president too.. But for the action of the moment, nothing does what it ought to do.. Instant depression, I learned my lesson, nothing that I'd rather do.. Come on over my place.. Can't see him sideways.. Honey, here's looking at you."
heroes,"I, I will be queen. And you, you will be king. Though nothing will drive them away. We can beat them, just for one day. We can be Heroes, just for one day. And you, you can be mean. And I, I'll drink all the time. 'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact. Yes we're lovers, and that is that. Though nothing, will keep us together. We could steal time, just for one day. We can be Heroes, for ever and ever. What d'you say?. I, I wish you could swim. Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim. Though nothing, nothing will keep us together. We can beat them, for ever and ever. Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day. I, I will be king. And you, you will be queen. Though nothing will drive us away. We can be Heroes, just for one day.

Just for one day. We can be Heroes. We're nothing, and nothing will help us. Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay. But we could be safer, just for one day.

little caesar,"My name is Little Caesar.. My friends call me LC.. My Daddy's named the same and passed it on to me.. I'm the kinda guy who by and by who wants to be your friend.. I'll make you a happy ending.. I loop the loo.. I do it good.. I've been called alot of names, some of them obscene.. But you think I'm funny and wonder about me?. I don't worry anymore, get uptight, or fear.. Back in the days of ""funny"" funny they called me queer.. They used to call me.. They called me rudely.. I'm a love 'em and leave 'em kinda fella, a goodtime gentleman.. Perform my magic for ya then I'll make my plan.. When I'm gone you'll feel so low: obsession out-a-hand.. You'll find I'll linger in your mind.. You can't forgive me.. You won't forget me.. You can't live without me.. Can't live without me.. You'll find there's not enough and that you love too much.. Can't live without me.. You can't live with me.. Can't live without me.. Just call me Caesar.. You can't forgive me.. You won't forget me.. I'm Little Caesar, yea.. Danceway. Be my TV Guide in between the stations.. Be my satellite: secret information.. Stairway going one way to the subway.. Waiting for the train.. Take it to the runway.. Journal in the Square, fingers in the hairdo.. England in the air, Beatle in the bathroom.. Highway going one way or another.. Let's get in the car.. Brooklyn Queens Expressway.. Turning in the light, singing to the doorway.. Standing on the side, listen to the subway.. (No one understands you, upperhands you, lonely valentine.. Bell and book and candle.). (Can I) Find The Right Words (To Say). Look up the right words, the ones for today.. Use them correctly and mean what I say.. Answer the questions.. Crossword confession.. Interrogation.. I'm down, can we meet?. Is it true do you cheat?. How far can I go?. How much do you know?. What's the definition?. How much did she mention?. How much does she know?. Can I find the right words to say?. The right words are so hard to say.. It's a challenger puzzle from the magazine section Across with the questions.. Do the ethics of reference.. One hundred twenty brain teasers to torment you.. One hundred thoughts.. I can't find the right words to say.. My meaning's not quite getting through.. The right words are so hard to say.. Can I find the right words for you?. Let's not hedge our bets 'cause the odds are dependent.. Please listen instead, now the whispers are ending.. The point's misleading as points often do.. Can I find the right words for you?. English Boys. When I was 17 I saw a magazine.. It had those English boys who had long hair.. When I was on my own they moved into my town,. and I just called 'em up and they'd be there.. In 1969 I had a lousy time.. I listened to the songs, read letters sent from Nam.. Now peace and love were gone, the tired soldiers home.. Ideal society gunned down the 70's.. Does it feel the same to you?. Why do you act the way you do?. Pack it up or pack it in.. There's no excuse.. Could the hands of time reverse?. Would we wake or take the ride. and again speak with one voice?. We knew each other well although we never met.. Messages passed to tell equal respect.. Coincidence recurred.. I had to laugh a lot.. One week hung up superb, said maybe not.. The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game. Everyday brings change and the old world puts on a new face.. Certain things rearrange and this whole world seems like a new place.. Secretly I've been tailing you like a fox that preys on a rabbit.. I had to get you and so I knew I had to learn your ways and habits.. Ooooooooooo ah, you were the catch that I was after.. I looked up and I was in your arms and I knew that I was captured.. What's this whole world coming to?. Things just ain't the same anytime the hunter gets captured by the game.. Oh yeah.. I had laid such a tender trap, hoping you might fall into it.. Love hit me with a sudden slap.. One kiss and then I knew it.. Ooooooooooo, my plan didn't work out like I thought.. I had laid my trap for you but it seems that I got caught.. What's this whole world coming to?. Things just ain't the same anytime the hunter gets captured by the game.. Oh yeah.. Yeah yeah.. Oh yeah.. Oh yeah.. . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

live it up,"Your old lover's lying in the gutter.. He used to be such an all night strutter.. ""Oh, my heart,"" I heard him mutter, ""Oh, my dear, it seems to flutter."". It's so hard to say, ""No,"" when the deck is stacked to only go slow.. It's easy sweet to live it up.. An easy street when you've had enough.. Darkened night, splashing light, soft and white and so polite.. Let him in, beneath the rim, beneath the skin, your next of kin.. Cleansing fire, funeral pyre, broken wire grown inside her.. Secret hush, swollen rush, it's soft and plush.. It's so plush.. You know it's so passe to sleep without you every day.. So easy to do your stuff, so easy to live it up.. . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

long time,"I've been running circles 'round a night that never ends. I've been chasing heartache in a city and a friend. I've been with you so long. Even seen you lose it, but who cares?. Racing down the bowery on a crowded afternoon. Draping from the davenport of your insecure typhoon. Can you even want me or is this just a way. To keep you safe?. Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours. Are you happy?. Does it take you a long time?. Does it make you upset?. Does it make you think. Everybody wants to be your friend?. I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend. I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend. Drinking with your cellphone with a smile on your face. Happy in success, but still a thousand miles away. Is this what you wanted?. Is this everything you had in store?. Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours. Are you, happy?. Does it take you a long time?. Does it make you upset?. Does it make you think. Everybody wants to be your friend?. I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend. I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend. Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours. Are you happy?. I've been running circles 'round a night that never ends. I've been chasing heartache in a city and a friend. I've been with you so long. Even seen you lose it, but who cares?. Does it take you a long time?. Does it make you upset?. Does it make you think. Everybody wants to be your friend?. I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend. I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend. Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours. Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours. Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours. Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours"
look good in blue,"You look good in blue.. It matches your skin, your eyes dripping with pain.. Someone like you, getting off on the lies. 'Cause it dulls your surprise again.. If it's alright with you,. I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on.. You look good in blue.. I know what you mean when you say you've seen the end.. Someone like you, been at it again, you knew what was up in the end.. If it's alright with you,. I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on.. Throw your weight on me baby.. Don't complain on me baby.. Escape in me, next to me.. I'm tired, always tired and I got not place to sleep.. Don't mind dividing down the line.. Can't say that I'm complaining. 'Cause I got no place to play, yeah.. Don't mind dividing down the line.. You look good in blue.. It matches your skin, your eyes dripping with pain.. If it's alright with you,. I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on.. Yes, I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on."
love at the pier,"Love At The Pier. We fell in love down at the pier.. You were sunbathing, I was around.. Soon we were sharing a beer.. We fell in love at the pier.. I'm no sentimental slob so don't think I'm queer .. You got somethin' baby, and it ain't just my beer.. Well, maybe it's the hot pants, maybe the heat,. or was it the sneakers you kicked of your feet?. I sat under my umbrella to keep my pearly skin.. You tanned your oily body looking like sin.. Well, soon I was sweatin' and I wanted to leave.. You slipped into the water from to much grease.. Well, I saw you yelling.. I just couldn't hear,. so I screamed back at ya ""Honey keep the beer!"". We never consummated our outside love affair.. Too much tar and water.. Too much hot air.. Oh, what a tragic end to love that was lost.. We would have stood a chance if we met in the frost, but.... We fell in love down at pier.. You were sunbathing, I was around.. Now I go to beaches with my girlfriend.. No more love splinters in my rear end."
love doesn't frighten me,"There's no coming, there's no going. There's no end. All this nothing is real something. It's time spent. Crying all night my tears are oceans. They come and go. Back in my eyes my love has feelings from long ago. Love doesn't frighten me at all. Love doesn't frighten me at all. I think you're the one who's living. And I'm dead. Doesn't matter for the moment. Is all we have. Crying all night my tears are oceans. They come and go. Back in my eyes my love has feelings from long ago. Love doesn't frighten me at all. Love doesn't frighten me at all. Love doesn't frighten me at all. Love doesn't frighten me at all. Love doesn't frighten me at all. Love doesn't frighten me at all. Love doesn't frighten me. Love doesn't frighten me"
love level,"Elevator's on the rise. Ridin' me up into the sky. Liftin' to you sudden (?). Numbers up above the door. Countin' down but going up. Climbing floor to floor. I wear my highest heels. I want to feel proximity. When you're with me. All, all I wanna do. Is level off, level it off with you. Everyone can see. That you got inches on me. But when we're lying down. The difference diminishes. What goes up must go down. Lookin' up at the love we found. Gotta get to you somehow. I can barely reach you now. I'm on my tippy-toes. Cause eye-to-eye is challenging. Ooh, I'm balancing [Well you know how it goes]. I put my lips where they belong. A kissing marathon. Let's meet up there next time. And level out when we arrive. The size will equalise us. All, all I wanna do. Is level off, level it off with you. And my condition is clear. The height of an absurdity. But when we're lying down. The difference is minimal. What goes up must go down. Lookin' up at the love we found. Gotta get to you somehow. I can barely reach you now. Opposites attract you know. No rules, no right or wrong. Cause when the love is strong. Everybody fucks Tall John. Learn, you never learn. You never leave me in the park. Dinner after dark. Learn, you never learn. You never ridin' to the floor. Coming back for more"

With what I know, he never stood a chance!. He gave it all for love.. He gave it all for love.. Said, lower the boats, he's sinking in a sea of love.. Lower the boats, he's sinking in a sea of love.. Yeah, I've been sailing the sea of love, experiencing romance.... With what I know, he never stood a chance.. No!. Man overboard!. Man overboard!. Man overboard!. Man overboard!. Throw him a line..

Ooh, don't you wanna take her?. wanna make her all your own?. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lights. I've seen this thing before. In my best friend and the boy next door. Fool for love and full of fire. Won't come in from the rain. She's oceans running down the drain. Blue as ice and desire. Don't you wanna make her?. Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lights.

more than this,I could feel at the time. There was no way of knowing. Fallen leaves in the night. Who can say where they're blowing. As free as the wind. And hopefully learning. Why the sea on the tide?. Has no way of turning?. More than this. you know there's nothing. More than this. tell me one thing. More than this. there is nothing. It was fun for a while. There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going?. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide?. Has no way of turning?. More than this. you know there's nothing. More than this. tell me one thing. More than this. there is nothing. (instrumental). No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide?. Has no way of turning?. More than this. you know there's nothing. More than this. Please tell me one thing. More than this. there is nothing. More than this. More than this. you know there's nothing. More than this. tell me one thing. More than this. there is nothing. More than this

night wind sent,"Your music, by the night wind sent, awakes my quiet instrument.. In the silence of your steps, I can see into the depths.. Messenger of sympathies, my heart beats loud in exstacy.. When your shadow falls on me, a sillouette; reality.. And I chase every night after you.. And I chase after you.. Of all your loaded mysteries, the color of your sympathies,. my words cannot express your awful loveliness.. So come with me through smoke and mirrors.. We'll bring our differences nearer.. We'll float upon an inland sea.. Embody visions of a dream.. And I chase every night after you.. I got a chill, and the night wind sent me a chill.. And the night wind sent me a chill.. You wander through my sleeping mind, reading thoughts I've left behind.. I always know when you've been there.. Tangles of perfume fill my hair.. Your music, by the night wind sent, awakes my quiet instrument.. In the silence of your steps, I can see into the depths.."
no exit,"There's no sin in this: getting dressed to kill, laughing down the sun like a jackal will.. With his eyes ablaze and his lips apart he's gonna fill his cup with the love in your heart and drink it up til the morning starts.. Circulate the red light vistas.. Get the girls and get their sisters.. Pinch em up and give em blisters.. Kiss em fierce with all his might, forever.. Bye bye to another life.. Bye bye to another life.. Bye bye to another life.. Bye bye to another life.. Standing on the verge of the edge of the ledge, waiting for me to fall, but then I got a call.. It said ""Wait, hold up homie!. You must be trippin!. You can't be putting that simpin and whimpin up in your pippin!. You better stand tall, fool you was born to ball.. Took a little fall and now you wanna end it all!. You've been chasing dreams like a hound dog on the hunt.. Take your place in the front.. Put your hand on the pump.. And it's right in your grasp, man.. I know they're laughing, but you'll be laughing later cuz time's are gonna get greater.. You's a player, and when I say player I mean player cuz your daddy and your uncle was a player.. Who's gonna cry for ya?. Who's gonna cry over you?. Who's gonna cry for ya?. Who's gonna cry over you?. Put yourself in your position.. You ain't wishin for no food and no warmth and no light, so you must be doing all right.. But wait a minute!. Something's wrong.. It's lunatic, it's mad, insane!. Busted like a water main.. Indulgence in another vein.. What they're saying round the neighborhood is what he's drinking's not aged in wood.. He's filling out.. He's all growed up.. He's all blowed up.. He's gotten fat.. He's filling out.. He's all growed up.. He's all blowed up.. He's gotten fat.. Sure enough at the midnight lounge there's a dent in the seat where the vampire sat.. Bye bye to another life.. Bye bye to another life.. Living dead is doing time, like drowning on the circle line.. Who's gonna cry for ya?. Who's gonna cry over you?. Who's gonna cry for ya?. Who's gonna cry over you?. Who's gonna cry over you?. Cry over you?. Tell me would they lie for you?. Die for you?. You're hoping that it's true for you do for you, fool.. But who's gonna cry?."
no imagination,"No Imagination. Eyes that tell me ""baby, you don't need no invitation"".. Let me smoke another cigarette before I make a move.. I can see me in the morning; losing my direction,. deep inside my overcoat, looking for the door.. I don't wanna stay with you.. I just wanna play with you.. One sweet abbreviation sleeping like the dead.. You think you're pretty, well, so do I.. You came to me but, passion eyes,. got no imagination to clutter up my head.. Eyes that mirror innocence and cannot sense the changes.. Lets have another drink, dear, before we get deranged.. I can see me in the morning; avoiding your detection,. slowly down the staircase, looking for the door.. All is fair in love and war but. I don't want your love no more.. One sweet abbreviation sleeping like the dead.. You're fragile and you're very green,. conditioned by a milk machine.. Got no imagination.. Got no imagination.. No.. Take a walk, kid.. Eyes that tell me ""baby, you don't need no invitation"".. Let me smoke another cigarette before I make a move.. I can see me in the morning; losing my direction,. deep inside my overcoat, footsteps for the door."
nothing is real but the girl,Some days are all Mondays.. Sort of time on ice.. It seems like jet planes on snowed in runways under clear blue skies.. Who needs it?. Nothing is real but the girl.. Nothing is real but her.. Money goes to money in a figure eight around me.. Money.. Who's gonna love me if I liquidate and drown me?. Nothing is real but the girl.. Nothing else feels solid.. We believe in love.. We believe in little things like Heaven up above and seven.. It's a lucky number!. We believe that something lives inside every thing there is.. Don't think about it much.. I mean it.. I believe it.. I believe it.. Wind down.. Put your mind down like your missing school.. You'll teach her to find out while your dying in your living room how much you need her.. Nothing is real but the girl.. Only her eyes are solid.. Nothing is real but her.. Nothing is real but the girl..

And he shoots you dead and he eats your head. And then you're in the man from Mars. You go out at night eating cars. You eat Cadillacs Lincolns too. Mercurys and Subaru. And you don't stop. You keep on eating cars. Then when there's no more cars you go out at night. And eat up bars where the people meet. Face to face. Dance cheek to cheek. One to one. Man to man. Dance toe to toe. Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars is through with cars. He's eating bars. Yeah wall to wall. Door to door. Hall to hall. He's gonna eat 'em all. Rapture. Be pure.

Well now you see what you wanna be. Just have your party on TV. 'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the TV's on. And now he's gone back up to space where he won't have a hassle with the. human race. And you hip hop. And you don't stop. Just blast off sure shot. Because the man from Mars stopped eating cars. And eating bars. And now he only eats guitars. Get up!."

Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly.. D.J. spinning, I said, ""My, My."". Flash is fast, flash is cool.. Francois, c'est pas flashe non due.. And you don't stop, sure shot.. Go out to the parking lot.. And you get in your car and drive real far.. And you drive all night and then you see a light.. And it comes right down and it lands on the ground.. And out comes the man from Mars.. And you try to run but he's got a gun.. And he shoots you dead and he eats your head.. And then you're in the man from Mars.. You go out at night eating cars.. You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too.. Mercurys and Subaru.. And you don't stop.. You keep on eating cars.. Then when there's no more cars you go out at night. And eat up bars where the people meet.. Face to face.. Dance cheek to cheek.. One to one.. Man to man.. Dance toe to toe.. Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars is through with cars.. He's eating bars.. Yeah, wall to wall.. Door to door.. Hall to hall.. He's gonna eat 'em all.. Rapture.. Be pure.. Take a tour through the sewer.. Don't strain your brain.. Paint a train.. You'll be singing in the rain.. Said don't stop to the punk rock.. Man to man, body muscular.. Sismic decibel by the jugular.. Wall to wall, tea time technology and a digital ladder.. No sign of bad luck in rapture.. Well now you see what you wanna be.. Just have your party on T.V.. 'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the T.V's on.. And now he's gone back up to space where he won't have a hassle with the human race.. And you hip hop.. And you don't stop.. Just blast off, sure shot.. 'Cause the man from Mars stopped eating cars. And eating bars. And now he only eats guitars.. Get up!."
rave (feat. miss guy),"Do not disturb is on the doorway. We are both inside burning up the roomrate. Stand there in the light so I can see you. I wanna feast my eyes. I'm burning down my memories. On the road to ruin one more time. Spoil me, let me see. Shatter all that matters and step out of a tragedy. It's never been better. I'm in the grip of my intentions. I'm almost paralysed, paralysed. I can't wait for honourable mentions. You get no guarantees, no guarantees. What I need. All dressed up and polished to a shine. All the ravenites. Stutter to the gutter slip into a limousine. It's never been better. On the road to ruin one more time. Spoil me, let me see. Shatter all that matters and step out of a tragedy. It's never been better. All dressed up and polished to a shine. All the ravenites. Stutter to the gutter slip into a limousine. It's never been better. On the road to ruin one more time. Spoil me, let me see. Shatter all that matters and step out of a tragedy. It's never been better. All dressed up and polished to a shine. All the ravenites. Stutter to the gutter slip into a limousine. It's never been better. On the road to ruin one more time. Spoil me, let me see. Shatter all that matters and step out of a tragedy. It's never been better"
rifle range,"Rifle Range. I was all alone with the scent of a bone and my heart was stuck in this emptiness zone.. I had not a care, though I wanted to hear the voice of a maiden who was playing down there.... At the rifle range, I lost my heart.. At the rifle range, I could not start.. At the rifle range, she left me so hot!. At the rifle range.. Like a victim of truce I was strung on a noose cracking at the news of a prey let loose.. I turned around to stare at the face she would wear and I ran through the gallows, her heart was down there.. At the rifle range, I lost my heart.. At the rifle range, I could not start.. At the rifle range, I heard a shot!. At the rifle range.. If I lose my head, we'll be certainly dead, with visions of acid, how I wish they bled.. The drummings of fear cause they're getting so near and I think of a lion who was devoured down there.. Yeah yeah yeah! At the rifle range, I lost my heart.. At the rifle range, I could not start.. At the rifle range, I heard a shot.. At the rifle range, she left me so hot!. At the rifle range, Bang bang!. At the rifle range, Bang bang!. At the rifle range, Bang bang!"
ring of fire (live),"Love is a burning flame.. It makes a fire of rain.. Bound by wild desire, I fell into a ring of fire.. Taste my love is sweet, when hearts like ours meet.. I fell for you like a child.. Oh, the fire went wild.. I fell into a burning ring of fire.. I went down down down, the flame it swept higher.. It burns burns burns, that ring of fire, that ring of fire.."
rip her to shreds,"Rip Her To Shreds. (Heypsst psst, here she comes now.). Oh, you know her.. Would ya look at that hair!. Yeah, you know her,. Check out those shoes.. She looks like she stepped out of the middle of somebody's blues.. She looks like the Sunday comics!. She thinks she's Brenda Starr..

rules for live,The song is called Rules of Living:). Here's the lyrics. Im another life. When the gods were crazy. And the measurement of time. Were the ending seasons. And maybe we believed. There was anger in the storm. Sometimes the Sky reminds me. And if you think that's wild. There's my dream of Egypt. And the colour of the Nile. You're a Roman Soilder. It's small world after all. But's older than you think. Sometimes your eyes remind me. Don't know why. I'll wait a lifetme till you find me. There are times. mmmm I've been this way before. mmmm I'll come this way again. So many things remind me. So many things inside. Sometimes your eyes remind me. Don't know why. I'll wait a lifetme till you find me. There are times. mmmm I've been this way before. mmmm I'll come this way again. So many things remind me. So many things inside. In another life. when the gods were crazy. And complaining all the time. And the people look at me. The volocano wants a bribe. And I'm still afraid of fire. mmmm I've been this way before. mmmm I'll come this way again. So many things remind me. So many things inside. mmmm I've been this way before. mmmm I'll come this way again. So many things remind me. So many things inside.
scenery,"We took too long to park the car. Ran across the street into the bar. Your face said it was four o'clock. I closed my eyes and hear a shot. The traffic lights were much too hot. I walked my eyes around the block. Purple shadows were so thin. I had to close my eyes again. I didn't know they were important to you. I thought their faces were a poster. Natural things, scenery. You showed me your kind of madness. Saw sound slipping silently. Time passenger to future shock. I closed my eyes and saw you drop."
screaming skin,"Following my lust for wander everywhere I've ever been, I can't escape the sound of it - the sound of my screaming skin.. My skin cries.. My blood sighs.. I still owe some dread on this hide.. Following my trust in wonder I watch the circus begin.. I can't ignore the scent of it - the scent of my screaming skin.. My skin cries.. My blood sighs.. I still owe some dread on this hide.. La la la la la la la.. La.. La la la la la la la.. I'm a multicellular individual.. You're way out of proportion!. We've got the hemodynamic connection.. Don't call me germ!. Allowing for my strength to muster.. My losses begin to win.. Tropical winds start to bluster, raising the fur on my skin.. My skin cries.. My spirits fly.. But I still owe some dread on this hide.. Oooh.. Yeah!. I'm a multicellular individual.. You're way out of proportion!. We've got the hemodynamic connection.. And don't call me germ!. Swallowing my pride no longer, I take the forbidden sun.. If I have been sculpted by hunger, I'm not the only one.. My skin cries.. My blood sighs.. I still owe some dread on this hide of mine.. La la la la la la la.. La la la la.. La la la la la la la la.. I'm a multicellular individual.. You're way out of proportion, ah ha!. We've got the hemodynamic connection.. Don't call me germ!. My skin cries.. My spirit flies.. But I still owe some dread on this hide.. My skin cries.. My blood sighs.. And I still owe some dread on this hide of mine.. My spirit flies.. My blood sighs.. And I still owe some dread on this hide of mine.. My skin cries.. My spirit flies.. But I still owe some dread on this hide.."
seven rooms of gloom - bônus,"(Holland - Dozier - Holland). I see a house, a house of stone. (Seven rooms). A lonely house 'cause now you've gone. (Filled with gloom). Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom. (Just seven rooms of gloom). I live with emptiness. (Filled with emptiness). Without your tenderness. You took the dream I had for us. Turned my dreams into dust. I watch the phone never rings. I watch the door that never rings. Bring you back into my life. Turn this darkness into light. I'm all alone in this house. Turn this house into a home. I need your touch to comfort me. The tender, tender arms that once held me. Without your love, your love inside. This house is just a place to run and hide. Seven rooms, that's all it is - seven rooms of gloom. Rooms of emptiness. Without your tenderness. Don't make me live from day to day. Watching the clock that ticks away. Another day, another way. Another reason for me to stay. I need you here, here with me. I need your loving desperately. I'm all alone, all alone. In this house that's not a home. I miss your love I once had known. I miss your kiss that was my very, very own. Empty silence surrounding me. Lonely walls they stare at me. Seven rooms, that's all it is - rooms of gloom. I live with emptiness. Without your tenderness. All the windows are painted black. And wait right here until you come back. I'll keep waiting, waiting. Until your face again I see [fade]"

shayla,"Shayla worked in a factory.. She wasn't history.. She's just a number.. One day she gets her final pay and she goes far away.. Green trees call to me.. I am free but life is so cheap.. Scenery is still outside of me.. All alone, trapped by its beauty.. Shayla turned to run away,. to leave in peace and end her stay.. Years of fear were in her way.. Lost in space and down she came.. Suddenly some subtle entity, some cosmic energy,. brushed her like shadows.. Down here we stop to wonder.. Cars on the freeway.. Bright lights and thunder."
slow motion,"What's all that commotion going on?. The boy in the back on his second attack wants his baby back.. Wants his baby back.. What's all that commotion that you hear?. The girl in the back who was doing the quake got a belly ache.. She can't concentrate.. Pick up the beat, you can move like you're made out of vapor.. ""Catch me if you can"" is what she said with her hands.. Come on and take me back.. Can you take her back?. When she gives you the beat and you get the shine, the world slows down and she stops on a dime.. Got a number when you close your eyes like a real magician.. Still she knows she'll never lose a thing.. She can put you up on a shelf until she wants to pull the string.. Still you know she'll never slip away.. Keep time in your head, counting in your head.. Slow motion.. I can play with time.. I can keep today but tomorrow's fine.. Stop and look at the pictures rolling in your head.. Slow motion.. You can play with time.. You can leave her today but tomorrow's fine.. Stop and live in your dreams at night, rolling in your bed.. Slow motion, you can stop on a dime.. Slow motion, you ought to try it sometime.. Take me back on another track.. Take me back, take me back.. Slow motion, you can pick up the beat.. Slow motion, you can stop on the street.. Take me back on another track.. Take me back, take me back."
songs of love,"all of our days we cry out for love. and we cry for the times that we lost in all. when we had it all, all our hopes and our dreams. all of our days we cry out for love,. and we try to create it again, again. to deny the laws and to leave it behind. REFRAIN:. sing sweet songs of love to me now. so the night will become one of love. sing sweet songs of love to me now. for i need to know you`re mine. . all of our days we long for a chance. to be lost in a trance of a love we share. a romantic love like no other before. all of our days we live on the run. but we try to believe that it`s just begun. that we`ll have the time to enjoy every day. REFRAIN:. sing songs, sweet songs of love.... . I love you, you know that I do. and forever IÂ´ll sing just for you. let me know you love me tonight. let me hold you in my arms. REFRAIN. ."
sound-a-sleep,"Close your eyes and you will see micro flashing neon lights.. Open your eyes and you will see it still looks like the same thing.. Lie and wait for sleep and listen to your heart beat too fast for sleep.. Close your eyes and you will see the sound-a-sleep.. I want to go, I want to go, I want to go down to go to sleep.. Your frame of reference is my swimming pool.. My, my swimming pool still looks like the China Sea.. Pool to sea and finally the sound-a-sleep.. Feel the muscles in your face twitch, relax,. remembering everything that went down and will go down.. I want to go down to sleep.. Insomnia, no sleep disease, petties parking, feed me please.. Lie and wait for sleep and listen to your heart beat too fast for sleep."
sunday girl,"I know a girl from a lonely street, cold as ice cream, but still as sweet.. Dry your eyes, sunday girl.. Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl.. Looks like he's in another world.. Run and hide, sunday girl.. Hurry up, hurry up and wait.. I stay away all week and still I wait.. I got the blues.. Please come see what your lovin means to me.. She can't catch up with the working crowd.. The weekend mood and she's feeling proud.. Live in dreams, sunday girl.. ""Baby, I would like to go out tonight"".. ""If I go with you my folks'll get uptight"".. Stay at home, sunday girl.. When I saw you again in the summer time,. if your love was as sweet as mine,. I could be sunday's girl."
sunday smile,"All I want is the best for our lives, my dear. And you know my wishes are sincere. What's to say for the days I cannot bare. A Sunday smile, you wore it for a while. A cemetery mile, we paused and sang. A Sunday smile, you wore it for a while. A Sunday smile, and we felt true. We burnt to the ground left a view to admire. Buildings inside church of white. We burnt to the ground left a grave to admire. And as we reach for the sky, reach the church of white. A Sunday smile, you wore it for a while. A cemetery mile, we paused and sang. A Sunday smile, you wore it for a while. A Sunday smile, and we felt true. A Sunday smile, you wore it for a while. A cemetery mile, we paused and sang. A Sunday smile, you wore it for a while.

susie and jeffrey,"Even though Jeff was worried, they weren't in a hurry.. They planned a lovely honeymoon.. Sue had a brand new Chevy, conservative, in good taste.. Only 30 payments due.. They had outstanding tickets.. They had no car insurance, but they had lots of things to do.. They were getting organized.. They had their plans all finalized.. The date was set for Saturday..

I'm the bee's greasy knees.. I shake 'em. I break 'em, I drop 'em from eight miles high, alright.. In the past my fate was cast.. My social life was limited to Halloween and New Year's Eve.. Monotony was killing me; approaching schizophrenia.. I hit the hot spots every night and... for the first time in my life,. the bouncers would greet me!. The doormen would escort me!. Managers adored me!. Photographers would follow me begging for:. 'A smile, Beast!'. 'Over here, Beast!'. 'Here, Beast!'. The hat check always said to me 'Hiya B, whatcha doin' later?'"".

the dream's lost on me,"I wake up laughing, thrown from a nightmare.. I come down standing when I'm tossed in the air.. Bright as Tiajuana.. Like a dose of Bella Donna.. I could cry but I don't wanna.. And the dream's lost on me.. I come out shootin' when trouble comes knockin'.. I greet bad news by sending it walkin'.. Happy or just crazy.. Relaxed or laxy.. Gonna keep my vision hazy.. And the dream's lost on me.. Cares are all buckshot and buffalo.. Every dark has an afterglow.. I'm not afraid of what's down below.. I keep my sights on the sky.. I wake up laughing, thrown from a nightmare.. I come down standing when I'm tossed in the air.. Bright as Tiajuana.. Like a dose of Bella Donna.. I could cry but I don't wanna..

too much,It can't be. You stole the keys from me. You locked me inside my rumor gloom. It's too dark to think that I love you. I think love you too much. I love you to the much. Got to go. Cause now i'm living standardized. And I've been living. Got to leave what i've been giving you. Without your love. Got to go. Cause now i'm living standardized. And I've been living. Got to leave what i've been giving you. Without your love. I'm not free. I can hardly breath. You locked me outside my heart. It's too dark to think that I love you. I think I love you too much. I love you to the much. Got to go. Cause now i'm living standardized. And I've been living. Got to leave what i've been giving you. Without your love. Got to go. Cause now i'm living standardized. And I've been living. Got to leave what i've been giving you. Without your love. You want me to be nothing. You want me to be nothing. Without you. I love you to the muc
under the gun [for jeffrey lee pierce],"I still can picture him: his hands in his back pockets.. He wasn't much for words, but when the wise kids made a racket he'd just have to go downtown, throw his weight around before starting over.. ""Say did you hear I've got a band?. Some guys I know from L.A.. We'll own the Rio Grande.. I'll pay you back next Friday.. You know it sure ain't big, just some cats I dig.. They said they'd do the gig."". Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado?. Oh Restless Shadow, out in the blue hills you're feeling hollow.. Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California?. I should have warned ya.. No place to go now but falling over.. Some hands can't make it on the run, under the gun.. Not for the younger.. Oh Jack Daniels, I feel your hunger.. I know you did your best, but you thought that you did not.. I wish that I had known before I heard the last shot.. You know, it's not a sin, that little badge of tin.. Just a momento.. So sad you loved in vain.. My comrades lost in battle.. The music wars are done from London to Seattle.. We all pay to play and all our yesterdays are starting over.. Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado?. Oh Restless Shadow, out on the blue hills you're feeling hollow.. Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California?. I should have warned ya.. No place to go now but falling over.. Ready to die.. Now he's ready to die.."
underground girl,"She's an underground girl in her underground world.. She never comes around, she stays underground.. Ask her what's her trip, she just bites her lip.. She's the coolest girl around, she's the girl from underground.. She's the girl who's always right.. She's the one who gets uptight.. Ask her how she's been, she'll give you some skin.. Well, hey! Everybody gonna follow her down.. Well, hey! Everybody's gonna go underground.. Well, hey! Everybody wants to be on her side.. No one's around she's gonna take you for a ride. (?). She's the coolest girl around, she's the girl from underground.. Oh, I don't wanna brag, but I know her bag.. Ask her were she's from, she's always playing dumb.. If you beat her with a whip, she just thinks it's hip.. You can see her at night, never in the light.. Here we go!. Where are we going?. I don't know.. Whoa, it's getting dark down here!. We're going way far down.. I think it's getting too deep.. I need quaaludes!. My legs are shaking!."
undone,"lalalala..... was that an invitation. can you explain IÂ´m so impacient. hey rise to the occasion. can you explain the reason why. You took a second look, second look. I saw you once, met you twice. uuhh...your presence feels so nice. youÂ´re silent, get your tongue untight. when then night comes into open wild,. you gotta say aha, before I come undone. you got a sweet expression,. is that the spot that I should kiss on,. hey tell me can you hear me. you gotta raise your voice `cause the music`s loud,. you gotta shout, spit it out. it seems that you got a quiet way. eyes that tell what you can`t say. I sure would like to read your mind,. youÂ´re speechless and I try and try. you gotta say aha, before I come undone. right from the start your kissing lips I burned up. if you just say something I won`t tell you to shut it up. it`s like an application,. filling in the open spaces. `cause I`ve been overtaken. and IÂ´m so sick of waitin`one two three, answere me,. answere me"
union city blue,"Union City Blue. Oh ho, oh ho, what are we gonna do?. Union, Union, Union City blue.. Tunnel to the other side.. It becomes daylight.. I say he's mine.. Oh, power/passion plays a double hand.. Union, union union city man.. Arrive, climb up four flights to the orange side.. Rearrange my mind.. In turquoise Union, Union, Union City blue.. Skyline, passion, Union City blue.. Power/passion plays a double hand.. Union, union union city man.. I say he's mine.. I have a plan.. I say he's my Union City man.. Oho, oho, what are we gonna do?. Union, Union, Union City blue."
victor,"Oh, I don't want you to go!. Oh, please don't leave me alone!. Oh!. No, I don't want you to go!. Oh, please don't leave me alone!. Oh!. Dear Annett,. Soon I'll be with you before they know, before the show.. I'm not a whore. I dance no more.. I'll be with you across the border, dearest Anastasia.. I'm leaving soon.. I'm sorry too, but burn this letter. Burn my picture.. They won't know I've crossed the border.. Love, Victor.. Oh, I don't want you to go!. Oh, don't leave me alone!. Oh!"
walk like me,"We don't wear that uniform;. paper men from pages torn right off the press :. suits for the regime.. The media's gone and had a baby.. Seventh wave, another navy.. I live in America: gridlock on the street.. Tell that girl you like her badge.. Tell that man you're the Nazz.. Tell them you're not the last walking in parade.. Dressed to test you up the road.. Tighter than the latest clothes.. Close the circle, walk in row, walking in parade.. Why don't you walk like me?. Walk like me?. Walk like me?. Carrying the standard stick and marrying the politik.. You won't know tomorrow what went down today.. Look at me; I'm in tune: references around my room.. Just another secret school, another cycle going by.. You never looked like that.. Don't look like me.. Don't take it back.. You never had a name like that, never had a color.. Walking like a millionaire.. walking on imported air.. Change the way you comb your hair and watch what you walk under.. Why don't you walk like me?. Walk like me?. Walk like me?. Walk like me?"
war child,"I need city lights, defense, and weaponry.. No way of knowing my life expectancy.. I learn resistance like I learn to see.. A living witness.. A lonely refugee.. I'm a war child.. I'm a war baby, and that's the difference between you and me.. I'm a war child.. My occupation is being occupied.. I stop at the corner to be identified.. Across the border they pretend victory.. I'm playing in the rubble and dream of destiny.. You weren't discovered by Khmer Rouge.. We hear of ""the troubles"" on the nightly news.. PLO lovers courting after the curfew.. Your father and brother have the West Bank blues."
what i heard,"Same old song and dance, I gave you another chance.. Drama every night. I don’t wanna fight. Same old story again: you wanna be my friend. It’s really gotta end.. Same old story !. Chorus. You told me you were done with her and I believed every word…. and now I wonder what I heard… ooooh !. You told me you were done with her and I believed every word…. and now I wonder what I heard… ooooh !. The drama won’t stop, he says he called the cops …. police don’t care ’cause he’s crazy.. You keep calling me. It’s a total bore, I’ve heard it all before, cat got out, he came running back for more.. I told you I’d be cool , now I feel like a fool. I got sucked into your crazy, but it won’t phase me.. It’s a total bore, I’ve heard it all before, the cat got out,. she came running back for more. Oh Oh Oh Oh… (x4)"
when i gave up on you,"When I gave up on you I took my time. Waiting for reasons to change my mind. But there were none. My fever won, so it was clear to me. That we should be done. Even though it was breaking my heart. You were perfect at the start. So right, that's why. Goodbye, so hard to say. And that's the reason. I haven't known that he walked away. Away. When I gave up on you, I gave up slowly. Waiting for reasons to keep us going. But there were none. My fever won, so it was clear to me. That we should be done. Even though it was breaking my heart. You were perfect at the start. So right and that's why. Goodbye, so hard to say. And that's the reason. I haven't known that he walked away. Away. I tried hard as I could. Sometimes people try harder than they should. Than they should. We were one in a million galaxies. One on a million wasn't good enough for me. We were one in a million and you know it's true. One on a million wasn't good enough for you. When I gave up on you I took my time. Waiting for reasons to change my mind. But there were none. But there were none. Goodbye, so hard to say. And that's the reason. I haven't known that he walked away. Away. I tried hard as I could. Sometimes people try harder than they should. Than they should"
will anything happen?,"I always said you could make it.. I know what I said and I meant it.. I always liked the way you played guitar.. I always knew that someday you'd go far.. And if you do, will anything happen?. Will it come true, will anything happen?. Will I see you again?. You said you'd be through here again.. Please don't forget I'm here waiting.. You always said that you would never change like the people. that you've met and the places that you've been.. And if you do, will anything happen?. Will it come true, will anything happen?. Will I see you again?. Will I see you again?. I always said you could make it.. Just don't forget that I said it.. Cause I always liked the way you played guitar. and I always knew that someday you'd go far.. And if you do will anything happen?. will it come true, will anything happen?. Will I see you again?. Will I see you again?. Will I see you again?. And if I do, will anything happen?"
words in my mouth,I wrote this song for someone else to sing. To see what a meeting of the minds might bring. But we're not exactly two of a kind. And our meeting has come to a grind. Words in my mouth. Thoughts in my head. Don't put your words in my mouth. That's not what I meant. Got an appetite for seduction. Muzzleloader and chewing gum. We're on opposite sides of a line. And our meeting has come to a grind. Eat your words. Hold my tongue. Bite and bitten. Beat the one. Get to the bottom and the womb (?) will turn. Eat your words. Hold my tongue. Bite and bitten. Beat the one. Get to the bottom and the womb (?) will turn. Words in my mouth. Thoughts in my head. Don't put your words in my mouth. That's not what I meant. Words in my mouth. (? the hour going sour). Thoughts in my head. (? going sour). Don't put your words in my mouth. (? the hour going sour). That's not what I meant. (?). Words in my mouth. Thoughts in my head. Don't put your words in my mouth. That's not what I meant. Words in my mouth. Thoughts in my head. Don't put your words in my mouth. That's not what I meant
x offender,"I saw you standing on the corner, you looked so big and fine.. I really wanted to go out with you, so when you smiled - I laid my heart on the line.. You read me my rights and then you said ""Let's go"" and nothing more.. I thought of my nights, and how they were.. They were filled with.... I know you wouldn't go.. You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in.. I had to know so I asked, you just had to laugh.. We sat in the night with my hands cuffed at my side.. I look at your life and your style.... I wanted nothing more.. I know you wouldn't go.. You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in.. I had to know so I asked, you just had to laugh.. Walking the line, you were a marksman.. Told me that law, like wine, is ageless.. Public defender.... You had to admit you wanted the love of a sex offender.. I know you wouldn't go.. You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in.. I had to know so I asked, you just had to laugh.. My vision in blue, I call you from inside my cell.. And in the trial, you were there with your badge and rubber boots.. I think all the time how I'm going to perpatrate love with you.. And when I get out, there's no doubt I'll be sex offensive to you.."
youth nabbed as sniper,"Don't look in here, yeah.. Sundown finds him out of town on the overpass,. his inner self glued to his .22.. Dirty metal in the speed of night, lights and broken glass.. My heart can destroy all I see.. Moving streets all make me lonely!. Come to me and be mine only.. I can hide us far from sight, but you must wait and I must fight this nothingness.. Walls, I see my little room.... I hear my parent's friends.. I hope that my actions make amends!. I would like to kill for love but I don't know how.... Here I lie so high above the crowd.. Busy streets all make me lonely!. Come to me and be mine only.. I can move us through the night, but you must wait and I must fight this emptiness.. Black top burns with silent screams.. Others stop my dreams.. Lightning Crash! Crash! Crash!. Fear causes some to live, others die real cool.. I died in the evening after school.. Be mine only.. Be my own.. Be mine only.. Be my own.."
