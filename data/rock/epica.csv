memory,"Midnight, Not a sound from the pavement. Has the moon lost her memory?. She is smiling alone. In the lamplight. The withered leaves collect at my feet. And the wind begins to moan. Memory, All alone in the moonlight. I can smile at the old days. Life was beautiful then. I remember. The time I knew what happiness is. Let the memory live again. Every street lamp. Seems to beat. A fatalistic warning. Someone mutters. And a street lamp gutters. And soon it will be morning. Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise. I must think of a new life. And I mustn't give in. When the dawn comes. Tonight will be a memory too. And a new day will begin. Burnt out ends of smoky days. The stale cold smell of morning. The street lamp dies. Another night is over. Another day is dawning. Touch me, It's so easy to leave me. All alone with the memory. Of my days in the sun. If you touch me. You'll understand what happiness is. Look a new day has begun..."
cry for the moon,Follow your common sense. You cannot hide yourself. behind a fairytale forever and ever. Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose. The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever. Forever and ever. Indoctrinated minds so very often. contain sick thoughts. And commit most of the evil they preach against. Don't try to convince me with messages from God. You accuse us of sins committed by yourselves. It's easy to condemn without looking in the mirror. Behind the scenes opens reality. Eternal silence cries out for justice. Forgiveness is not for sale. Nor is the will to forget. Follow your common sense. You cannot hide yourself. behind a fairytale forever and ever. Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose. The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever. Forever and ever. Virginity has been stolen at very young ages. And the extinguisher loses it's immunity. Morbid abuse of power in the garden of Eden. Where the apple gets a youthful face. Eternal silence cries out for justice. Forgiveness is not for sale. Nor is the will to forget. Follow your common sense. You cannot hide yourself. behind a fairytale forever and ever. Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose. The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever. Forever and ever. Eternal silence cries out for justice. Forgiveness is not for sale. Nor is the will to forget. You can't go on hiding yourself. Behind old fashioned fairytales. And keep washing your hands in innocence
the phantom agony,"I. IMPASSE OF THOUGHTS. I can't see you. I can't hear you. Do you still exist?. I can't feel you, I can't touch you,. Do you exist?. The Phantom Agony. I can't taste you, I can't think of you,. Do we exist at all?. II. BETWEEN HOPE AND DESPAIR. The future doesn't pass. And the past won't overtake the present.

sensorium,"Chance doesn't exist. But the path of life is not totally so predestined. And time and chronology show us how all should be. In the ways of existence. To find out why we are here. Being consciousness is a torment. The more we learn is the less we get. No one surveys the whole, focus on things so small. But life's objective is to make it meaningful. Only searching for this. That which doesn't exist. Although our ability to relativize remains unclear. Being consciousness is a torment. The more we learn is the less we get. Every answer contains a new quest. A quest to non existence, a journey with no end. I'm not afraid to die. I'm afraid to be alive without being aware of it. I'm so afraid to, I couldn't stand to. Waste all my energy on things. that do not matter anymore. Our future has already been written by us alone. But we don't grasp the meaning. of our programmed course of life. We only fear what comes. And smell death every day. Our future has already been wasted by us alone. And we just let it happen and do not worry at all. Our future has already been written by us alone.

a phantasmic parade,Playing a million pictures in my mind. That travel at the speed of light. Been living in a world turned inside out. Diving through a sea that is profound. Gracing the code above and tasting life. The will options deciphered signs. Believing worlds below that crushed mankind. Breaking ground within the great design. Do not try to defy creation. See the world through the looking glass. Within reach is a fading horizon. Deep down the flames grow. You may find you're hallucinating. If reality is defied. I can sense the eclipse is rising. Showing the blood red moon. This time your mind. Will find a virtual phantasmic parade. It is a choice that is my own to make. A free will to risk a leap of faith. Is it my outcome that I will survive?. Finding out my life has been a lie. Do not try to defy creation. See the world through the looking glass. Within reach is a fading horizon. Deep down the flames grow. You may find you're hallucinating. If reality is defied. I can sense the eclipse is rising. Showing the blood red moon. This time your mind. Will find a virtual phantasmic parade. Make believers. Your divine machinery. Not believing. This will seal the deal. Seize the liar. Selling hollow prophecies. Burn the hounds alive.

You may find you're hallucinating. If reality is defied. I can sense the eclipse is rising. Showing the blood red moon. This time your mind. Will find a virtual phantasmic parade. Do not try to defy creation. See the world through the looking glass. I live to not let go. You may find you're hallucinating. If reality is defied. Behold the vertigo. I won't let go.

On the battle. Here we die as heroes. Red as fire. Hearts will bleed to death"

We can't hide cruel commands. We will see their last stand. From the heart where we belong. Yet we all know. Why the cruel commandments came along. Forever blind to the wasteland beyond"

if inside these walls was a house,"Come and rest your head here peacefully. All of us are safe until the sun starts rising. The walls are strong. Time to rejoin our strength to defeat them leading to our victory. Raindrops dancing over heavy hearts. The fire in the eyes of death hides in the corner. Glowing lights brush off all the fright. Our dreams navigate us in our search of liberty. Restless memories keep hunting us. It is time to cast the storm that lives within you. The great divide, fortune's on our side. Designing a plan to raise the monsters' atrophy. Avenge the soul that's watching over us. Listen to the voice that guides us on our way. I see the light in your eyes shining brighter tonight. Unbroken chains sustained with agony shall be the triumph of a world. That's living in the flames. Slaughter glorified. Bleeding hands are tied. Rivalry untold. Battles to behold. Standing up to murdering machines. We pave the way to our victory. Oceans' plenty flames. Voyagers untamed. Beating hearts of fear. Warfare drawing near. Endless source of our misery. Deliver us from the madness. Dive into the waves be free. Defeating our tragedy. The future's bright and you will see. We'll still be here in the morning. We won't bow down won't abide. The law they live by won't destroy our lives. We are wandering on this lonely road ahead. Leaving fear behind as long as you're on my side. Turn the key and come with me. The sentience within us liberates our frame of mind. Dreams navigate us in our search of liberty"

Unlock the hidden heart inside. See the wonder of my world. With true transparent eyes. All that is real. You alone welcome the other side. Far from the distant shores. Lies another paradise unlighted. Unlock the hidden heart inside. See the wonder of my world. With true transparence. Deep within a forlorn stream. Lies the wonder of my world. In a true transparent dream. I make progress. I walk. The path of self-mastery. Let go of all agony"

white waters,"I see a silhouette, liquid that moves. Skin like a pearl in the sea. I cannot resist this, her voice in the wind. But is it my eyes are deceived?. Is it you I see?. Lie down in my arms. Trust what you see. Smooth your brow, you will be with me. To find your relief. Gazing at whitecaps, coming so close. Everything's suddenly clear. Numb with the aching, and still I am waiting. The water is pulling me near. Would you welcome me?. Lie down in my arms. Try not to breathe. Quiet love, you are now with me. You need no words to speak. For my mistakes, I am to blame. Never believed that it was all meant to fall. I'd give my life, to have you near once again. Take me away, would you forgive me?"
