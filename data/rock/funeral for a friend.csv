The stars are not wanted now. put out every one. Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun. Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood. For nothing now can ever come to any good"

Damned if you do, dead if you don't it’s the age of youthfulness. To cause or curse. As if it spoke to claim them the light will guide us. And our shepherd will guide our way through this propaganda. So sing it loud, I’m not giving up on you or anyone I know. I have a feeling, at the bottom of this glass. Everything will pass, at least not for us. So sing it loud. Damned if you do dead if you don’t"

modern excuse of a man,"Island liver like we think that we're ""oh, so special"". Like we're owed the things that we can never quite hold on to. Let me ask you something. Do you think this weather suits you?. Let me ask you something. Do you think it suits you?. So if I see you and your words fail to connect with mine. Let me be the first to apologize. For every fucking thing that I haven't done or will do. So you can quietly walk on by. Into a distant memory where I will lock you up. And throw away the key. We're sick of playing these shitty games. I'm sick of playing these shitty games"

All works and play there's nothing left to say. They wouldn't want it any other way. Running fast when the lights are fading. We make the same mistakes. We know we have to face. Someday the fires will keep on burning. But today run away never look behind. The time it takes to walk home alone. The pleasure stops keeps weakness. From the top of your head. Servants blockade informants keep the peace. The pleasure stops why does it have to stop. All works and play there's nothing left to say. You wouldn't want it any other way.

I see the way you lie to them (tune in-tune out). All for the country you say (fuck them-fuck us). Progress is the alternative to which we align. Hopeless intuition, raped between the lines. You tune in you tune out. Climbing a ladder fucked before we get out. You tune in you tune out. Climbing a ladder fucked before we get out. This system this lie."
the diary,"""The Diary"". And it came from nothing. But there was always something. And when the sky burned brighter. And the nights grew darker. Hold on to everyone. That I hold dearly. To my heart.

the distance,"Days in motion. From the west coasts to the ocean. Mainline to the sunset. As we're sitting in the van. We're heading out to mainland. Age is nothing but a number. The difference in experience that we relate. Well the distance from where the heart lies. Between the words and sometimes,. It's a meaning to interpret and relate. And a moment in explosions, like looking out the window. As we're passing by the places out of state. A conversation. Ending in frustration. I never saw the faces. Before it was too late. Indecision. Is better than compliance. Questioning the motives. Before it turns to hate. Well the distance from where the heart lies. Between the words and sometimes,. It's a meaning to interpret and relate. And a moment in explosions, like looking out the window. As we're passing by the places out of state. A seconds chance to get things right. Transition between the dark and the light.

And a moment in explosions, like looking out the window. As we're passing by the places out of state"

the getaway plan,"Wasted journey's, time spent better knowing nothing. and looks, they don't help.. Prying eyes wander west to where oceans meet gold,. and you wonder why my heart, it breaks in two..

the path,"'ve seen the symmetry of how life unfolds. You live to die, you die to live. Inbetween you breath for a series of moments. Fill your lungs with air, and air will fill you with life. Open your eyes and see, and seeing will show you how to live. I've watched the assemetric view of birth. You live to love, you love to live. Inbetween you cry for all the heartbreak. Fill your lungs with air, and air will fill you with life. Open your eyes and see, and seeing will show you how to live. I've waited the linear path of age. You live to grow, you grow to live. In between you stop and wait for something. Fill your lungs with air, and air will fill you with life. Open your eyes and see, and seeing will show you how to live"

this letter,"As you swallow this confession. And leave me with this scar. As It takes another second. To let me go too far. It doesn't seem to matter, anymore. The road less-traveled.

travelled,"I'm fucking sick. So sick and tired. Of coming back. To these broken places. It leaves a hole in me. That can never be filled again. It leaves a hole in me. That can never be filled.

I'm tired and I'm jaded some. No we will never be the same old. And all the places, and all the people. Do you regret it. Would you even know?. Would you even know?. Waking up each day.

vultures,"There’s a point to make. That sometimes goes unheard. Like the blood in your veins. You often forget. What we are is a species on the brink. Who’ll be left to pick our bones clean. And the vultures swarm high above. Ready to feed of the last of us. Sacrificial lambs. Lead to the slaughter. We eat the shit. They feed us everyday. When there’s one great idea amongst the rest. They try their best to put it back in its place. And the vultures swarm high above. Ready to feed of the last of us. So carve me up and hold me down. I’m not done speaking my mind. They said it wouldn’t hurt one bit when they brought us to the brink. They said it wouldn’t hurt one bit. Extinction, it’s on our minds"
waking up inside my own paralysis,"Is a lie just the truth. uncovered and relinquished. a passion for all young fools. Is a lie just the truth. a question left unanswered. to feed the failure of our choices. And in my hands our blood recovered. And for our faith we're undeserved. And in my hands our blood recovered. And in your faith completely. Do we wait all this time. and follow blindly hating,. killing all that we survey. Must we hate all this time. and let our anger lead us,. lead us to our bitter end. Your wasting our time. (turn the light's out when you leave). When everything's said and done. we're dead buried. And will this never end,.
