paperthin hymn,"When your only friends are hotel rooms. Hands are distant lullabies. If I could turn around I would tonight. These roads never seemed so long. Since your paperheart start beating leaving me suddenly alone. Will daybreak ever come?. Who's gonna call on sunday morning?. Who's gonna drive you home?. I just want one more chance. To put my arms in fragile hands. I thought you said forever. Over and over. A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion. These thoughts run through my head. Over and over. Complaints of violins become my only friends. August evenings. Bring solemn warnings. To remember to kiss the ones you love goodnight. You never know what temporal days may bring. So laugh, love, live free and sing. When life is in dischord. Praise ye the lord. Who's gonna call on sunday morning?. Who's gonna drive you home?. I just want one more chance. To put my arms in fragile hands. I thought you said forever. Over and over. The sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion. These thoughts run through my head. Over and over. Complaints of violins become my only friends. I thought you said forever. over and over. The sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion. These thoughts run through my head. over and over. Complaints of violins become my only friends. I thought you said forever. over and over. These thoughts run through my head"
enjoy the silence,Words like violence. Break the silence. Come crashing in. Into my little world. Painful to me. Pierce right through me. Cant you understand. Oh my little girl. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Vows are spoken. To be broken. Feelings are intense. Words are trivial. Pleasure remains. So does the pain. Words are meaningless. And forgettable. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Enjoy the silence

Conversate to the sounds. To the sounds of a record player. With it's jumping needle and the lights that grow dim over time. With downcast eyes. There's more to living than being alive. With downcast eyes. There's more to living than being alive. Are you where you thought you'd be. So beautiful and only twenty-three. Opposition rests in the hearts. With no, with no, with no opportunity. It's not that we don't talk. It's just no one really listens and honesty fades. Like a politician lost in the course. All smiles and no one remembers our names. With downcast eyes. There's more to living than being alive. With downcast eyes. There's more to living than being alive. With downcast eyes. There's more to living than being alive. With downcast eyes. There's more to living than being alive. Don't try to wake me up. Even if the sun really does come out tomorrow. Don't believe anything I say.

dissenter,"Pioneers will get the arrows. But you know now, that's where you'll find me. Won't stop striving, can't stop working. You know I'll be known at the gates. I can't clothe your back forever. I'm dissenter from you socialists. How can you say ""non-believer"". When the sand runs from your fingers. Whoa! Neah! now!. Bring it all to me!. Yeah! Now!. Bring your soul to me!. It's the lingo; leave no witness. Your confusion cripples me. Drink it in now, live the moment. You are children in a land of men. Lived the life, but now it's over. All you have is yesterday. There's no ties now, there's no binding. Try as you might, you can't hold me back anymore!. Yeah! Now!. Bring it on to me!. Yeah! Now!. Bring your soul to me!. Yeah! Now!. Come and get me out!. Yeah! Now!. Bring your soul to me!. For so long, I've dreamt of this. Could it console me now?. I'd stay awake and dream. Replay every word you said to me. For so long, I've waited for this. And now it's finally here. Whoa! Neah! now!. Bring it all to me!. Yeah! Now!. Bring your soul to me!. Yeah! Now!. Come and get me out!. Yeah! Now!. Bring your soul to me!"
down,"You would have loved who I used to be. Yesterday, I would have hated the boy you see. When you found me I was at my worst. The best I was is a long forgotten curse. You caught me one the way down. Please hold my hand before I drown. Tie my hands before I burn this town. You caught me on the way down. I feel like a shell of yester-years gone by. Bad decisions like those that just wont die. I'm so sorry that I can't apologize. What comes next is another long goodbye. You caught me on the way down (honey, honey). Please hold my hand before I drown. Tie my hands before I burn this town. You caught me on the way down. You caught me on the way down. Please hold my hand before I drown. Tie my hands before I burn this town. You caught me on the way down. By Bhiel."
downtown song,"Hey up town girl. Can you hear this down town song?. Wrote a couple of words to tell you. Right here is where you belong. I bet you walk the streets. Wondering who you’re thinking of. Hope you’re looking for someone to hold. And not at all in love. And I wonder if you can relate. To nights upon my pillow case. Eyes wide open middle of the night. You’re the last thing on my mind. [Chorus]. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. What nights like these do to me, yeah. I keep asking myself. If our hands were meant to be. I know this town is busy,. But I live on Public Street. We can get out of here. If only for just tonight. Ride like some Rollin stone. That’s forced to waste your life. And I wonder if you can relate. To nights upon my pillow case. Eyes wide open middle of the night. You’re the last thing on my mind. [Chorus]. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. What nights like these do to me. When I’m under (when I’m under). Is it me you’re thinking of?. With this light (get on your knees). I pray you’re not at all in love. With someone else (with someone new). With something other than me and you. Just wanna be where you are (Just where you are). If ever you’re lonely I won’t be far. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. What nights like these do to me, yeah. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. Only the lonely know. What nights like these do to me. . Lyric By Mila_Crazyx"
driving,"And we're driving just as fast as we can. And we're racing to outrun the wind. It's just me and you and you and me. So wild and so young, bright-eyed and free. And we're trying to get lost from here. As a small town romance draws ever near. And I swear we're in a movie. The highlight comes when you kiss me. And the stereo sings our sing. And we don't hesitate sing. And we're miles from the middle of nowhere. And neither of us seems to care. And that's why I love you so-o-o. So shut your mouth girl no one has to know. And times seems to drip like Dali. And neither of us has any place to be. So once and forever tell me all, tell me all of your dreams. And the stereo sings our song. And we don't hesitate just sing. Is this what driving brings?. All the while we're singing off key. Is this what driving brings?. All the while we're singing off key. And we're driving just as fast as we can. And we're racing to outrun the wind. And the stereo sings our song. We don't hesitate just sing along. And the stereo sings our song. We don't hesitate just sing. Is this what driving brings all the while we're singing off key?. Is this what driving brings. All the while we're singing off key. Is this what driving brings...."
embrace the dead,"Coming through your district. I see the red light on. I feel the warmth of the street. And I feel the drugs infecting me. Don't come screaming. Cold words, demands. Helpless you cry. Each night you pray that tomorrow you won't die. You're living, barely breathing. Embrace the Dead. Raise your hands. To the god in the sky. That let's you breathe tonight. Coming through your district. I see the rip lipstick on. You sell yourself so cheap. Sleep with the night to carry on. Don't come screaming. Cold words, demands. Helpless you cry. Each night you pray that tomorrow you won't die. You're living, barely breathing. Embrace the dead. Raise your hands. To the god in the sky. That let's you breathe tonight. You're living, barely breathing. You're living, barely breathing. You're living, barely breathing. You're living, barely breathing. You're living. You're living. Embrace the dead. Raise your hands.

enjoy the silence,Words like violence. Break the silence. Come crashing in. Into my little world. Painful to me. Pierce right through me. Cant you understand. Oh my little girl. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Vows are spoken. To be broken. Feelings are intense. Words are trivial. Pleasure remains. So does the pain. Words are meaningless. And forgettable. All I ever wanted. All I ever needed. Is here in my arms. Words are very unnecessary. They can only do harm. Enjoy the silence

You are the way out of here. The grace that I have found. Constant reminders everywhere in between.
fin,"Feels like I'm miles from here in other towns. With lesser names where lonely ghost doesn't tell. Merry old William exactly what they want to hear. You remember the house that we drew. Told you and the devil to both just leave me alone. If this is salvation I can show you the trembling. You'll just have to trust me. I'm scared. I am the patron saint of lost causes. Aren't we all to you just near lost causes. Are we all to you just lost?. Tell me you're left behind. Something you'll mean everything right before you die. But if you gain the world. You've already lost four little souls from your life. Widows and orphans are hard to find. Their home is in daddy who's saving you random tonight. Where's your drink? And would hurry and kill you. Sympathy's better than having to tell you the truth. That you are the patron saint of lost causes. All you are to them is now a lost cause. All you are to them is now causes. Billy, don't you understand?. Timothy stood as long as he could. You made his faith disappear. More like a magician. And less like a man of the cloth. We're not questioning God.

There is shelter, shelter from the mire of life. Claiming sanctuary from the fire that drove you in. You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine. Climbing the stairs towards heaven. Making our own way into the room. Empty, barren. Not another soul in sight. Then when the moon came crawling. There in the night, a great divide. A whisper, a motion, calling. We're the 99 all right. But if all can be made right. there's still a chance on New Years' Day. And if all is well that means there's still a chance in hell. You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine. There is shelter, shelter from the mire of life. Claiming sanctuary from the fire that drove you in. You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine. Now a tradition said. Buying penance did a wrong and right. A great collapse. Great collapse. You are safe here, safe here in these arms of mine. There is shelter, shelter from the mire of life.
