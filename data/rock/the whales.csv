born of the sea,I start like a wave. moving and singing. the size of a cave. the truth never seems. I drown in my love. their harpoons not hurt me. I am my own crown. go to crawling. reflects on the waves. shining and breathing. I drown in your face. deep and deepert. I drown in my love. their harpoons not hurt me. I am my own crown. go to crawling. I'm ready (to cross the ocean). for one day. I wait your ok. I live in a jar. I see all the stars. I drink you. I leave you. when I enter the your brain. inside your head again. I live in the jar
come on rain,"Come on rain, clean me inside. you have locked doors. I do not open. I am dirty boy. clean me inside. come on rain, clean me inside. we have only one door. you can enter. Open my secret door. clean me inside. come on rain, clean me inside. i'm sorry for this, i make you cry. but shine"
islands,"When I cant see. their secret island. Stranded in your own heart. I felt all its seasons. I feel I have to belong. I can listen to all your emotions. I can touch on your fears. please take me to the path. but I can see. When I cant see. their secret island. Stranded in your own heart. I felt all its seasons. I feel I have to belong. Your breath is my windows. where I feel like flying. his soul reigns the my God. I'm in the tide. I can see the lady, opening up your mind. be a lesson, Secret side. I see islands in your mouth. have someone on the ground. I live on islands"
