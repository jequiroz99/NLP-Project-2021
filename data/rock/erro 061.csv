say it,I woke up this day. things and words I cannot say. Say my name and ask me why. And I'll tell you I cannot stay. They don't trust me. When I say that they are wrong. But you don't trust me. When I say that they are. World keeps running. And you can't runaway. they will tell you. And I'll tell I cannot. World keeps running. And you can't find your pain. Leav your little world. Now you have to runaway. They don't trust me. When I say that they are wrong. But you don't trust me. When I say that they are. All my secrets you just said. Before I can make my way. Before I can make my way. They don't trust me. When I say that they are wrong. But you don't trust me. When I say that they are. When I say that they are wrong
