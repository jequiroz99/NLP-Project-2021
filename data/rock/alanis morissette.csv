ironic,"An old man turned ninety-eight. He won the lottery and died the next day. It's a black fly in your Chardonnay. It's a death row pardon two minutes too late. Isn't it ironic... don't you think?. It's like rain on your wedding day. It's a free ride when you've already paid. It's the good advice that you just didn't take. Who would've thought... it figures. Mr. Play it Safe was afraid to fly. He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye. He waited his whole damn life to take that flight. And as the plane crashed down he thought. ""Well, isn't this nice."". And isn't it ironic ... don't you think?. It's like rain on your wedding day. It's a free ride when you've already paid. It's the good advice that you just didn't take. Who would've thought... it figures. Well life has a funny way. of sneaking up on you. when you think everything's okay. and everything's going right. And life has a funny way. of helping you out. when you think everything's gone wrong. and everything blows up in your face. A traffic jam when you're already late. A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break. It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife. It's meeting the man of my dreams. And then meeting his beautiful wife. And isn't it ironic... don't you think. A little too ironic.. and yeah I really do think.... It's like rain on your wedding day. It's a free ride when you've already paid. It's the good advice that you just didn't take. Who would've thought... it figures. Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you. And life has a funny, funny way of helping you out. Helping you out"
head over feet,I had no choice but to hear you. You stated your case time and again. I thought about it. You treat me like I'm a princess. I'm not used to liking that. You ask how my day was. (chorus). You've already won me over in spite of me. Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet. Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are. I couldn't help it. It's all your fault. Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole. You're so much braver than I gave you credit for. That's not lip service. (repeat chorus). You are the bearer of unconditional things. You held your breath and the door for me. Thanks for your patience. You're the best listener that I've ever met. You're my best friend. Best friend with benefits. What took me so long. And I've never felt this healthy before. And I've never wanted something rational. And I am aware now. And I am aware now. (repeat chorus)
you oughta know,"I want you to know that I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but the best for you both. An older version of me. Is she perverted like me. Would she go down on you in of theater?. Does she speak eloquently. And would she have your baby. I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother. Cause the love that you gave that we made. Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no. And every time you speak her name. Does she know how you told me you'd hold me. Until you died, 'til you died. But you're still alive. And I'm here to remind you. Of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair to deny me. Of the cross I bear that you gave to me. You, you, you oughta know. You seem very well, things look peaceful. I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know. Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity. I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner. It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced. And are you thinking of me when you fuck her. Cause the love that you gave that we made. Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no. And every time you speak her name. Does she know how you told me you'd hold me. Until you died, 'til you died. But you're still alive. And I'm here to remind you. Of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair to deny me. Of the cross I bear that you gave to me. You, you, you oughta know. Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me. And i'm not going to fade. As soon as you close your eyes and you know it. And everytime I scratch my nails down someone else's back. I hope you feel it ... well can you feel it?. And I'm here to remind you. Of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair to deny me. Of the cross I bear that you gave to me. You, you, you oughta know"
you learn,I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone. I recommend walking around naked in your living room. Swallow it down (what a jagged little pill). It feels so good (swimming in your stomach). Wait until the dust settles. (chorus). You live you learn. You love you learn. You cry you learn. You lose you learn. You bleed you learn. You scream you learn. I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone. I certainly do. I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time. Feel free. Throw it down (the caution blocks you from the wind). Hold it up (to the rays). You wait and see when the smoke clears. (repeat chorus). Wear it out (the way a three-year-old would do). Melt it down (you're gonna have to eventually anyway). The fire trucks are coming up around the bend. (repeat chorus). You grieve you learn. You choke you learn. You laugh you learn. You choose you learn. You pray you learn. You ask you learn. You live you learn

london,"What it feels to fall in to the pool. The hard shell bugs bite my forearm. My right index fingernail chewed to the quick. My cervix is a long one. My sprinklers go off at 6pm each day. And sometimes they spray unsuspecting visitors. My pimples are goosehairs all over my legs. My brow is furrowed and my vision is blurred. And how I do love London. And how I do love London. The birds make guttural sounds and protect me. My friends come to visit and love me a lot. I don't have the energy to fill this. I am like flight attendants on a 12 hour flight. And how I do love London. And how I do love London. I am intrigued by the boy with songs. sometimes they write sometimes they write not. The steam will smell of eucalyptus in the shower. The hug will feel forced upon you, inconsolable thing. And how I do love London. And how I do love London. Deep breaths will not make my brain stand still. To be loved and swallowed are single and depraved. I love speaking French to the taxi drivers. We slept and were cold on the train out of France. And how I do love London. And how I do love London."

king of pain,There's a little black spot on the sun today. It's the same old thing as yesterday. There's a black hat caught in a high tree top. There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I'm always hoping. that you'll end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the king of pain. There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall. (that's my soul up there). There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall. (that's my soul up there). There's a blue whale beached. by a springtide's ebb. That's my soul up there). There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I'm always hoping. that you'll end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the king of pain. There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out. There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt. There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed. There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread. There's a red fox tornb by a huntsman's pack. There's a black winged gull with a broken back. There's a little black spot on the sun today. It's the same old thing as yesterday. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I always hoping. that you will end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the queen of pain. I'll always be queen of pain
forgiven,"You know how us Catholic girls can be. We make up for so much time a little too late. I never forgot it, confusing as it was. No fun with no guilt feelings. The sinners, the saviors, the loverless priests. I'll see you next Sunday. (Chorus). We all had our reasons to be there. We all had a thing or two to learn. We all needed something to cling to. So we did. I sang Alleluia in the choir. I confessed my darkest deeds to an envious man. My brothers they never went blind for what they did. But I may as well have. In the name of the Father, the Skeptic and the Son. I had one more stupid question. (Repeat chorus). What I learned I rejected but I believe again. I will suffer the consequence of this inquisition. If I jump in this fountain, will I be forgiven. (Repeat chorus). We all had delusions in our head. We all had our minds made up for us. We had to believe in something. So we did"

And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already. If only I could hunt the hunter. And all I really want is some patience. A way to calm the angry voice. And all I really want is deliverance. Do I wear you out?. You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out. I'm consumed by the chill of solitary. I'm like Estella. I like to reel it in and then spit it out. I'm frustrated by your apathy. And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land. If only I could meet the Maker. And I am fascinated by the spiritual man. I am humbled by his humble nature. And what I wouldn't give to find a soulmate. Someone else to catch this drift. And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred. Enough about me. Let's talk about you for a minute. Enough about you. Let's talk about life for a while. The conflicts, the craziness. And the sound of pretenses falling. All around, all around. Why am I so petrified of silence?. Here, can you handle this?. Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines?. Or when you think you're gonna die?. Or did you long for the next distraction?. And all I need now is intellectual intercourse. A soul to dig the hole much deeper. And I have no concept of time, other than it is flying. If only I could kill the killer. And all I really want is some peace, man. A place to find a common ground. And all I really want is a wave-length. And all I really want is some comfort. A way to get my hands untied. And all I really want is some justice"

So here I am one room away from where I know you're standing. A well-intentioned man told me you just walked in. This man knows not of how this information has affected me. But he knows the colour of the car I just drove away in. What are you my kin? You touch me like you are my kin. What are you my air? You affect me like you are my air"
(change is) never a waste of time,"I know there's a reason you're forcing a smile. You hide what you're feeling and you have for a while. I can tell that you're falling. And you feel that you can't go on. But a new day is calling. And you'll see that the feeling is gone. Chorus:. You know you're not the only one. Who has a lot to overcome. And when the time has come then you move on. 'Cause you've been crying for too long. Sometimes life is so unkind. But change is never a waste of time. I know how you're feeling, I've been there before. The hurting is something much to strong to ignore. Don't be waiting for someone. Who can take all your fear away. When there's no one to listen. That is when you should not be afraid. Repeat Chorus. But change is never a waste... it's never a waste of time. ."

I was born in 1974. in a breached feet-first way. my twin opened the door. my very first dose of chivalry.

all i really want,"Do I stress you out?. My sweater is on backwards and inside out. And you say: ""how appropriate!"". I don't want to dissect everything today.

And all I really want is deliverance. Do I wear you out?. You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out. I'm consumed by the chill of solitary. I'm like Estella.

And I am fascinated by the spiritual man. I am humbled by his humble nature. And what I wouldn't give to find a soulmate. Someone else to catch this drift. And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred. Enough about me. Let's talk about you for a minute. Enough about you. Let's talk about life for a while. The conflicts, the craziness. And the sound of pretenses falling. All around, all around. Why am I so petrified of silence?. Here, can you handle this?. Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines?. Or when you think you're gonna die?. Or did you long for the next distraction?. And all I need now is intellectual intercourse. A soul to dig the hole much deeper. And I have no concept of time, other than it is flying. If only I could kill the killer. And all I really want is some peace, man. A place to find a common ground. And all I really want is a wave-length. And all I really want is some comfort. A way to get my hands untied. And all I really want is some justice"

I will break from the weight of the high road I take. No. Indeed I need my chance to fail. Some room to unravel. I need a chance to blame for two minutes. Unbridled, unbrazened. So I need imaginings of maiming. Fantasies of outright screaming. I need a chance to thrash for minutes. Uncontained, unforgiving. Who am I kidding?. I am not some Mother Theresa. If I don't do something soon. I will die from restraint. As a sick subjugate. No. I will move beyond, I'm certain of that. The sooner I go the quicker I'll be back.

citizen of the planet,"I start up in the north I grow from special seed. I sprinkle it with sensibility. From French and Hungarian snow. I linger in the sprouting until my engine’s full. Then I move across the sea. To European bliss. To language of poets. As I cut the cord of home. I kiss my mother’s mother. Look to the horizon. Wide eyed, new ground. Humbled by my new surroundings. I am a citizen of the planet. My president is kwan yin. My frontier is on an airplane. My prisons: homes for rehabilitating. Then I fly back to my nest, I fly back with my nuclear but everything is different. So I wait, my yearn for home is broadened, patriotism expanded by calling from beyond. So I pack my things nothing precious all things sacred. I am a citizen of the planet. My laws are all of attraction. My punishments are consequences. Separating from source the original sin. I am citizen of the planet. Democracy’s kids are sovereign. Where the teachers are the sages. And pedestals fill with every parent. And so, the next few years are blurry, the next decades’ a flurry of. smells and tastes unknown. Threads sewn straight through this fabric through fields of every. color one culture to another. I come alive and I get giddy I am taken and globally naturalized. I am a citizen of the planet. From simple roots through high vision. I am guarded by the angels. My body guides the direction I go in. I am a citizen of the planet. My favorite pastime edge stretching. Besotten with human condition. These ideals are borne from my deepest within"

Well I guess you can't come out for a while. Won't you move closer and comfort me now. Move over if you care for me. Well I've come to learn how love can cage you. Tear you up then try to replace you. I guess I won't come out for a while. With no warning, no pause, no pity. Why, why, why. Don't wake awake my soul anymore. Just stay away from me a little while. Where will you go when we walk away. My only comfort is gone. With no warning, no pause, no pity"

front row,"Do you go to the dungeon.. To find out how to make peace. With your days in the dungeon?. Writing a letter to you didn't make me any more peaceful.

I'm in the front row. The front row with popcorn. I get to see you see you close up.. You never meant to be ungrateful nor held up. To be whipped or wept for certainly not analyzed. Prodded at more ways than one apparently you've been. Misrepresented dealing with the concept of arrows. Being slung towards your outrageous fortune.. Hey I'm not mad at you guardian. I'm mad at myself for spending so much time. With you and your jeckyl and hydeness. I'm glad I figuratively slapped you on the wrist. You laughed a wicked laugh and said 'come here let me clip. your wings'. (I know he's blood but you can still turn him away. you don't owe him anything). ""Raise the roof"" he yelled ""yeah raise the roof"" I yelled back.. (unfortunately you need a health scare to. reprioritize). No thanks to the soap box.. Having me rile against them won't make an ounce of difference.. I'm in the front row. The front row with popcorn.. I get to see you see you close up.. Oh the things I've done for you many a sitch. A friend a man's been left for you oh the books. I've read for you the tongues I've bitten for you many a new. City for you many. A risk taken for you (not a single regret)."

happiness is a warm gun,"She's not a girl who misses much. She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet. hand. Like a lizard on a window pane. The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors. On his hobnailed boots. Lying with his eyes while his hands. Working over time. A soap impression of his wife which he ate. And donated to the Nation's Trust. I need a fix cause I'm going down. Down to the bitch that I left uptown. I need a fix cause I'm going down. Mother Superior jumped the gun. Mother Superior jumped the gun. Happiness is a warm gun. Happiness is a warm gun. When I hold you in my arms. And I feel my finger on your trigger. I know that nobody can do me no harm. Happiness is a warm gun, mama. Happiness is a warm gun"
havoc,Just when I thought. I had handles on this. I could soften my guard behind false confidence. Just when I found. Humble pie insipid. Exempt from this blindside and firmly in its grip. Cause I'm seduced by reaction and under the influence. I'm sliping again I'm. Up to my tricks off my wagon. I have no defense I'm. Wreaking havoc. Wreaking havoc and consequence. I get reduced by my own willfulness as. I reach for my usual God replacements. Cause I am rich with sanction and lax in my steps. I'm sliping again I'm. Up to my tricks off my wagon. I have no defense I'm. Wreaking havoc. Wreaking havoc and consequence. It forgiveness is understanding then I. offer mea culpa for the millionth time. From this toppling house of card of mine. I am beaten by my impulsiveness. By this uncanny foreshadowing of regret. Cause I'm repulsed by restriction at least that's my excuse. I'm sliping again I'm. Up to my tricks off my wagon. I have no defense I'm. Wreaking havoc. Wreaking havoc and consequence
head over feet,I had no choice but to hear you. You stated your case time and again. I thought about it. You treat me like I'm a princess. I'm not used to liking that. You ask how my day was. (chorus). You've already won me over in spite of me. Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet. Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are. I couldn't help it. It's all your fault. Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole. You're so much braver than I gave you credit for. That's not lip service. (repeat chorus). You are the bearer of unconditional things. You held your breath and the door for me. Thanks for your patience. You're the best listener that I've ever met. You're my best friend. Best friend with benefits. What took me so long. And I've never felt this healthy before. And I've never wanted something rational. And I am aware now. And I am aware now. (repeat chorus)

i remain,How crass you stand before me with. no blood to fuel your fame. How dare you wield such flippancy. without requisite shame. Your very existence becomes. my scared mission's bane. You bow to kiss my hand. and I ignore ignited flame. I moved to meet you. Untouched I do remain. To some it seems foreign my eye. Would steely forge ahead. This land entrusted to me knows. not of hallowed secrets. I'll keep it to myself. my irade eye swim in my head. Your charm can not distract me from. the path I'm born to tread. How I'm thrilled to know you. Unaffected I remained. How I've learned to like you. Undeterred I do remain. Less daunting as team. You unlikely king by my side. And me so much better for trusting you. My hand over your heart while you. keep hindrances at bay. Color me surprised by how our union saves the day. How I've grown to need you. As my soldier need fades. How I love to love you. And how'd I remain. I remain (repeat)

I was hoping we could crack each other up.. I too thought that when proved wrong, I lost somehow.. I too thought life was cruel.. It's a cycle, really.. You think I'm withdrawing and guilt tripping you.. I think you're insensitive and I don't feel heard.. And I said ""Do you believe we are fundamentally judgmental?. Fundamentally evil?"". And you said Yes.. And I said I don't believe in revenge, in right or wrong, good or bad?. And you said ""Well, what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency. room,. Bleeding after beating his kid, and she threw a shoe at his head.. I think what he did was wrong, and I wouldn't have had a hard time feeling. compassion for him."".

jekyll & hyde (featuring souleye),"We're at once like peas in a pod. Like gloves around a hand. Our arms are wrapped around each others shoulders. And then we're on fire with parity. With standards of golden. With birds that are of feathers of predictability. And while I am flying high. You fly beside. Just when I start to drop my guard, then. Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde. I get used to your light, then the jarring blindside. Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde. When I drop my guard, you bring out the dark side. I am done with your Jekyll and Hyde. [Souleye]. I thought there was a protocol. On how you treat a friend. Your hot and cold, I'd share my soul. But you're not listening. So I'm not stressing it. No pressure on my mind at all. Just curious about your split personality. Allegory double life. One moment's really nice. Next moment, exploding on me like it was dynamite. With no responsibility to be accountable. I guess I'm gone free away now from your hold. When you're kind, your kind is transcendent. Harmony rules the land. But sure as night turns to day, it is always uncertain. Just when I'm lulled by your sweet side. The harder the fall when you flip the script each time. Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde. I get used to your light, then the jarring blindside. Step off with the Jekyll and Hyde. When I drop my guard, you bring out the dark side. Here you come with the Jekyll and Hyde.

There's a red fox tornb by a huntsman's pack. There's a black winged gull with a broken back. There's a little black spot on the sun today. It's the same old thing as yesterday.

You make the knees of my bees weak. Tremble and buckle. You make the knees of my bees weak. You are a spirit that knows of no limit. Who knows of no ceiling, who balks at dead ends. You are a wordsmith who cares for his brothers. Not seduced by illusion of fair weather friends. You make the knees of my bees weak. Tremble and buckle. You make the knees of my bees weak. You are a vision who lives by the signals. Of stomach and intuition as your guide. You are sliver of God on a platter. Who walks what he talks and who cops when he's lied.

london,"What it feels to fall in to the pool. The hard shell bugs bite my forearm. My right index fingernail chewed to the quick. My cervix is a long one. My sprinklers go off at 6pm each day. And sometimes they spray unsuspecting visitors. My pimples are goosehairs all over my legs. My brow is furrowed and my vision is blurred. And how I do love London. And how I do love London. The birds make guttural sounds and protect me. My friends come to visit and love me a lot. I don't have the energy to fill this. I am like flight attendants on a 12 hour flight. And how I do love London. And how I do love London. I am intrigued by the boy with songs. sometimes they write sometimes they write not. The steam will smell of eucalyptus in the shower. The hug will feel forced upon you, inconsolable thing. And how I do love London. And how I do love London. Deep breaths will not make my brain stand still. To be loved and swallowed are single and depraved. I love speaking French to the taxi drivers. We slept and were cold on the train out of France. And how I do love London. And how I do love London."
madness,"Madness. I've been most unwilling to see this turmoil of mine. The thought of sitting with this has me paralyzed. With this prolonged exposure to near and averted eyes.

You simply brought this madness to light and I should. thank you. Oh thank you, much thanks for this birds eye view. Oh thank you, for your most generous triggers.

magical child,"It's quiet simple when I'm listening. You keep leading me all the way home. These messages,. You've been offering as a magical child. An essential child. It hinges on the driver's seat. It depends on who's in control. When I waver on the attuning. I kill a magical child. This essential child. Oh. To thine own self be true. To my core self be true. When direction is confounding. When vitality is far gone. When the spark is out, uninspiring. I call the magical child. The essential child. Oh. To thine own self be true. To my core self be true. When I'm lost and I'm unraveling. When I'm off my track and I float. When I need true north and some grounding. I call the magical child. The essential child. This angelic child. This innocent child. To thine own self be true. To my core self, be true. Angelic child. Innocent child. Magical child. Essential child"
mary jane,"What's the matter Mary Jane, you had a hard day. As you place the don't disturb sign on the door. You lost your place in line again, what a pity. You never seem to want to dance anymore. It'sa long way down. On this roller coaster. The last chance streetcar. Went off the track. And you're on it. I hear you're counting sheep again Mary Jane. What's the point of trying' to dream anymore. I hear you're losing weight again Mary Jane. Do you ever wonder who you're losing it for. Well it's full speed baby. In the wrong direction. There's a few more bruises. If that's the way. You insist on heading. Please be honest Mary Jane. Are you happy. Please don't censor your tears. You're the sweet crusader. And you're on your way. You're the last great innocent. And that's why I love you. So take this moment Mary Jane and be selfish. Worry not about the cars that go by. All that matters Mary Jane is your freedom. Keep warm my dear, keep dry. Tell me. Tell me. What's the matter Mary Jane"
mercy (from the prayer cycle),We have slaughtered. If the garden of beauty. Digging graves instead of planting. Mercy for the crucified. A bitter justice. Begging eternity for love. We´re nothing. We´re everything. I am nothing. Yet I am everybody. We´re nothing. And yet we are. Wisdom lights up life´s road. I know you
moratorium,I've never been this accountable-less and within. I've never known focuslessness on any form. I've never had this lack of ache for dalliance. To let go and let god in ways I have never even imagined. I declare a moratorium on things relationship. I declare a respite from the toils of liaison. I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement. I declare a full time out from all this commitment. I've never let my grasp soften fingers like this. I've never been careless otherless like autonomy's twin. I declare a moratorium on things relationship. I declare a respite from the toils of liaison. I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement. I declare a full time out from all this commitment. Ah to breathe. Stop looking outside. Stop searching in corners of rooms. Not my business or timing. Ahhh. I've never known freedom from intertwining. I start again this time for keeps in my skin I'm residing. I declare a moratorium on things relationship. I declare a respite from the toils of liaison. I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement. I declare a full time out from all this commitment. by /snipes_

movement iii: hope,Before my body dies. I pray. That the river I was born to. May again wash over me. By God's touch I pray. That I may move from this consecrated. Earth. Into the next season. A dark season. Beyond the dying religions that. Seduced us. My soul will surrender. And give in to grace. .
movement ix: faith,My unborn forgive me. I only wish I had the strength to bring. You into this world. More faithful. . . . . . . .
movement vi: innocence,"By moon we gather. For the ascension. Great sky shelter us. With your endless compassion. Last survivor. It is you who must pass. Into the light of the new world. Under a sky of innocence. We are now all dying. In a slow black rain. Was it a failure. Of man and angels?. Was it a failure of love?. From this human river. Too cruel for winter. Welcome to the gates. A rehearsal for the silence. Pray we do not enter. Under a sky of innocence. We bathe in the seduction. Beautiful. The light is unraveling now. We open our arms to it. It is close to ground zero. I am no one. Yet I am everyone. We are nothing, but we are all. When I am still, I am inspired. We are not yet born. Half sadness. But half choice. When I am still I can hear. You speak most clearly. Father can you help me. For the ocean is big. And my boat is small. Find the courage."

narcissus,Dear momma's boy I know you've had your butt licked by your mother. I know you've enjoyed all that attention from her. And every woman graced with your presence after. Dear narcissus boy I know you've never really apologized for anything. I know you've never really taken responsibility. I know you've never really listened to a woman. Dear me-show boy I know you're not really into conflict resolution. Or seeing both sides of every equation. Or having an uninterrupted conversation. And any talk of healthiness. And any talk of connectedness. And any talk of resolving this. Leaves you running for the door. (why why do I try to love you. Try to love you when you really don't want me. To). Dear egotist boy you've never really had to suffer any consequence. You've never stayed with anyone longer than ten minutes. You'd never understand anyone showing resistance. Dear popular boy I know you're used to getting everything so easily. A stranger to the concept of reciprocity. People honor boys like you in this society. And any talk of selflessness. And any talk of working at this. And any talk of being of service. Leaves you running for the door. (why why do I try to help you try to help you. When you really don't want me to). You go back to the women who will dance the dance. You go back to your friends who will lick your ass. You go back to ignoring all the rest of us. You go back to the center of your universe. Dear self centered boy I don't know why I still feel affected by you. I've never lasted very long with someone like you. I never did although I have to admit I wanted to. Dear magnetic boy you've never been with anyone who doesn't take your shit. You've never been with anyone who's dared to call you on it. I wonder how you'd be if someone were to call you on it. And any talk of willingness. And any talk of both feet in. And any talk of commitment. Leaves you running for the door. (why why do I try to change you try to. Try to change you when you really don't. Want me to). You go back to the women who will dance the dance. You go back to your friends who will lick your ass. You go back to being so oblivious. You go back to the center of the universe.
naysayers,I've had glimpses of the highest versions since my youth. I saw pictures of these predetermineds. That were extraordinary. They were born out the gate. What to do when they come true. Well you naysayers. And you dream killers. And by all others be damned. I'm an example of perseverance. In the face of 'you can't'. I'd seen moments of sweet partnership before we could. I've had times where I could smell. The smells of something pure portending. I saw sea colored eyes. What to do when they come true. Well you naysayers. And you dream killers. And by all others be damned. I'm an example of perseverance. In the face of 'you can't'. I've had goals of serving far and wide while ridiculed. I've had notions of a family with someone brave like you. They were feared? and inviting. What to do when they come true. Well you naysayers. And you dream killers. And by all others be damned. I'm an example of perseverance. In the face of 'you can't'. Aspirations of offering benefit through god misused. I've seen pictures of our love abiding long before I married. I had shot for the moon. What to do when they come true
no,My mind is invaded. My gates are ignored. My thoughts are negated. And you're on a roll. And I am offended. By your acts of shamelessness. Your lack of conscience. And your flagrant steamroll. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. My sorrow is lift off. My rages discounted. My fears are founded. This dam is no more. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. Don't touch me. My body is frozen. Thanks to you. And I've sat with these secrets. I'm no longer weighted. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?. What part of no do you not understand?. Do you not understand?
no apologies,Whenever we talk about sun all I see is the rain. It's like looking for tears in a ocean. I'm hearing your words like the wind. They blow straight through my heart. Will you ever give into emotion. And we hurt the ones that we love the most. Why we do only heaven knows. And I don't know why I'm still holding on...holding on. Chorus:. I reach in my heart to see. If your love is alive in me. But now I feel alone. My feelings turn to stone. My heart makes no apologies. When an apology's made it isn't always enough. To erase all the past in a moment. Whenever I need you the most. You always leave me behind. With a word from your lips I'm alone. You've been blind not to realize. All the love that I hold inside. So tell me why do I keep holding on...holding on. Repeat Chorus (x2). (And we hurt the ones that we love the most. Why we do only heaven knows. And I don't know why I'm still holding on...holding. on). What I need is your sympathy. Like a light flowing into me. Will I ever give up holding on... holding on.... Repeat Chorus
no avalon,"I'm just a white girl. From a small, safe town. What could I possibly know about destruction?. My lawn sure looks green today. Underneath these suburban skies. But the little boy next door. Wants to be the Lord of the Flies. It's like Cain and Able. And the Holy Sacrifice. And I have to believe that God. Has closed his eyes. And if there is no Avalon. And we only have one life. It's hard to conceive why we let our brothers die. My bed is so safe here. And my rose-coloured glasses, they're broken. And how the truth leaks in. And I, I can't imagine. I saw it on the news tonight. That they'd announce his name. I saw the blood on his hands. And they told me to look away. I tell yaiit's like Cain and Able. And the Holy Sacrifice. And I have to believe that God. Has closed his eyes. And if there is no Avalon. And we only have one life. It's hard to conceive why we let our sisters die. It's like.... Why, why?. Why?. It's a confusing civilization, darling. It's like Cain and Able. And the Holy Sacrifice. And I have to believe that God. Has closed his eyes. And there is no Avalon. And we only have one life. It's hard to conceive why we let our people die. We let 'em die. And watch them die"
no pressure over cappuccino,"And you're like a 90's jesus. And you revel in your psychosis. How dare you.... And you sample concepts like hors d'euvres.

They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots. And they'll stumble around like hypocrites. and is it just me or is it dark in here?. Well you may never be or have a husband,. you may never have or hold a child.. You will learn to lose everything,. we are temporary arrangements.. And you're like a 90's noah.

norwegian wood,"I once had a girl, or should i say, she once had me.. She showed me her room, is not it good, norwegian wood?. She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,. So i looked around and i noticed there wasn't a chair.. I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.. We talked until two and then she said, ""it's time for bed"".. She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.. I told her i didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.. And when i awoke i was alone, this bird had flown.. So i lit a fire, is not it good, norwegian wood.."

But I want you to remember my name. It's not all me. It's not all my fault. I need remind you, but I won't take it all on. Past riddled rage. I see the buttons I engage. Is my dignity in place?. I'm all too happy to switch. It's not all me. It's not all my fault. I need remind you, but I won't take it all on. Lest I find my voice. Find the strength to stand up to you. Lest I stay to my limit. And only take on what is mine to. We are a team. I'm here to help mend and rescind. All I trigger unknowingly. A job I hold in high esteem. It's not all me. It's not all my fault. I need remind you, but I won't take it all on. It's not all me. It's not all my fault. I need remind you, but I won't take it all on. I'll only take some of it"

I'm faking it til I'm pseudo making it. From scratch begin again but this time I as I. And not as we. Gun shy and quivering. Timid without a hand. Feign brave with steel intent. Little and hardly here. Day one, day one, start over again. Step one, step one. With not much making sense just yet. I'm faking it til I'm pseudo making it. From scratch begin again but this time I as I. And not as we. Eyes wet toward. Wide open frayed. If God's taking bets. I pray He wants to lose. Day one, day one, start over again. Step one, step one. I'm barely making sense just yet. I'm faking it till I'm pseudo making it. From scratch begin again but this time I as I. And not as we"
not the doctor,I don't want to be the filler if the void is solely yours. I don't want to be your glass of single malt whiskey. Hidden in the bottom drawer. I don't want to be the bandage if the wound is not mine. Lend me some fresh air. I don't want to be adored for what I merely represent to you. I don't want to be your babysitter. You're a very big boy now. I don't want to be you mother. I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months. Show me the back door. (chorus). Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at ten past six. Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh. Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom. You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor. I don't want to be the sweeper of the eggshells that you walk upon. I don't want to be your other half I believe that 1 and 1 make 2. I don't want to be your food or the light from the fridge on your face at midnight. Hey what are you hungry for. I don't want to be the glue that holds your pieces together. I don't want to be your idol. See this pedestal is high and I'm afraid of heights. I don't want to be lived through. A vicarious occasion. Please open the window. (repeat chorus). I don't want to live on someday when my motto is last week. I don't want to be responsible for your fractured heart and its wounded beat. I don't want to be a substitute for the smoke you've been inhaling. What do you thank me. What do you thank me for. (repeat chorus)

Can't sit with this feeling. I'd rather be flying and comfortably numb. I feel anxious. I feel nervous, I am bored. I'm overwhelmed, rather be out of my gourd. How to remove myself from sensation?.

I am livid, need a hug. Here comes a feeling. I run from the feeling and reach for the drug. Can't sit with this feeling. I'd rather be flying and comfortably numb"

But he had no idea about my built up tolerance. No idea about how manipulative I?ve become. I would seruptitiously put it in front of him without him asking. In a pretty little shot glass. His smirk and cackle would only agg me on. Bring on the Tequila oh. On fire on Tequila oh. Mostest most on Tequila oh. Bestest friends on Tequila oh"

spoon,"Dave :. Spoon in spoon. Stirring my coffee. I thought of you. And turned to the gate. And on my way came. Up with the answers. I scratched my head. And the answers were gone. From hand to hand. Wrist to the elbow. Red blood sand. Could Dad be God. Crosses cross hung. Out like a wet rag. Forgive you why. You hung me out to dry. Maybe I'm crazy. But laughing out loud. Makes the pain pass by. And maybe you're a little crazy. But laughing out loud makes it all subside. Holding, I'm holding. I'm still falling. I'm still falling. Spoon in spoon. Stirring my coffee. I thought of this. And turned to the gate. But on my way. Crack. Lightning and thunder. I hid my head. And the storm slipped away. Well maybe I'm crazy. And laughing out loud. Makes it all pass by. And maybe you're a little crazy. And laughing out loud. Makes it all alright. Laughing out loud. Alanis :. From time to time. Minutes and hours. Some move ahead while. Some lag behind. It's like the balloon that. Rise and then vanish. This drop of hope. That falls from his eyes. Dave :. Spoon in spoon. Stirring my coffee. I think of this. And turn to go away. But as I walk. There're voices behind me saying. Sinners sin. Come now and play. Laughing out loud. Come now and play"

surrendering,"You were full and fully capable. You were self sufficient and needless. Your house was fully decorated in that sense. You were taken with me to a point. A case of careful what you wish for. But what you knew was enough to begin. And so you called and courted fiercely. So you reached out, entirely fearless.

And I'm amazed by your surrender in the face of threatening forces That I represent. You found creative ways to distance. You hid away from much through humor. Your choice of armor was your intellect. And so you felt and you're still here. And so you died and you're still standing. And so you softened and still safely in command. And I salute you for your courage. And I applaud your perseverance. And I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces. That I represent. Self protection was in times of true danger. Your best defense to mistrust and be wary. Surrendering a feat of unequaled measure. And I'm thrilled to let you in. Overjoyed to be let in in kind. I salute you for your courage.

We thought a break would be good. For four months we sat and vacillated. We thought a small time apart. Would clear up the doubts that were abounding.

I've always wanted for you what you've wanted for yourself. And yet I wanted to save us high water or Hell. And I kept on ignoring the ambivalence you felt. And in the meantime I lost myself, in the meantime I lost myself. I'm sorry I lost myself, I am. You knew you needed more time. Time spent alone with no distraction. You felt you needed to fly solo and high. To define what you wanted. At that particular time love encouraged me to leave. At that particular moment I knew staying with you meant deserting me. That particular month was harder than you'd believe but I still left. At that particular time"

the couch,"You hadn't seen your father in such a long time.. He died in the arms of his lover.. How dare he?. Your mother never left the house.. She never married anyone else,. You took it upon yourself to console her.. You reminded her so much of your father,. So you were banished. And you wonder why you're so hypersensitive.. And why you can't trust anyone but us.. But then how can I begin to forgive her?. So many years under bridges with dirty water.. She was foolish and selfish and cowardly if you ask me.. I don't know where to begin in all my 50 old years.. I have been silently suffering and adapting,. perpetuating, and enduring.. Who are you younger generation to tell me that I have. unresolved problems?. Not many examples of fruits of this type of. excruciating labor.. How can you just throw words around like grieve and. heal and mourn?. I feel fine, we may not have been born as awake as you were.. It was much harder in those days, we had paper routes. uphill both ways.. We went from school to a job to wife to instant. parenthood.. I walked into his office, I felt so self-conscious on. the couch.. He was sitting down across from me, he was writing. down his hypothesis. I don't know.. I've got a loving supportive wife who doesn't know how. involved she should get.. You say his interjecting was him just calling me on. my shit?. Just the other day, my sweet daughter, I was driving past 203.. I walked up the stairs in my mind's eye.. I remember how they would creak loudly.. She was only responsive with a drink,. He was only responsive by photo.. I was only trying to be the best big brother I could.. I've walked sometimes confused sometimes ready to. crack open wide.. Sometimes indignant, sometimes raw.. Can you imagine I pay him 75 dollars an hour. sometimes?. It feels like highway robbery.. And sometimes it's peanuts.. I wish it could last a couple more hours.. So here we both are battling similar demons (not. coincidentally). You see in getting beyond knowing it slowly. intellectually,. You're not relinquishing your majesty.. You are wise, you are warm, you are courageous, you are big.. And I love you more now than I ever have in my whole life.. . by jun!or"

the morning,"So it starts with the pauses. As singular and quiet. It's still and it is patient. Intended as it grows. And we go. From sunrise to sun falling. From daughter to sister. Angels to Maria.

the time of your life,"Standing there on a road that leads to anywhere. Like a child left in the wilderness, standing there penniless. Wanting to be the best.

Why do they try and generalize, why are they. antagonizing me. But something I can't control that.... (Chorus:). I WANTCHA. You know I'll never stop 'til I've GOTCHA.

Show you the time of your life. Here we are and I wonder how we've come this far. In a world that does not recognize women are. victimized. What does that symbolize. Why do I want the things I usually criticize. It may be self destructiveness, or maybe it's. emptiness inside. But something I can't control that.... (Chorus). You'll have a good time.... It's a lonely road, and no one knows the way that I feel. I'm not giving up now... I'll never try to justify. They'll never understand, you'll be a happy man. You'll have the time of your life.

there are worse things i could do,"Grease. (Recited in the middle of Ironic from Tinley Park). . There are worse things I could do, than go with a boy or two. Even though the neighborhood thinks I'm trashy and no good. I suppose it could be true, but there are worse things I could do. I could flirt with all the guys, smile at them and bat my eyes. Press against them when we dance, make them think they stand a chance. Then refuse to see it through, that's a thing I'd never do. I could stay home every night, wait around for Mr. Right. Take cold showers every day, and throw my life away. On a dream that won't come true. I could hurt someone like me, out of spite and jealously. I don't steal and I don't lie, but I can feel and I can cry. A fact I'll bet you never knew. But to cry in front of you, that's the worst thing I could do."
these are the thoughts,These are the thoughts that go through my head in my. Backyard on a Sunday afternoon. When I have the house to myself and I'm not expending. All that energy on fighting with my boyfriend. Is he the one that I will marry?. Why is it so hard to be objective about myself?. Why do I feel cellularly alone?. Am I supposed to live in this crazy city?. Can blindly continued fear. Induced regurgitated life-denying tradition be overcome?. Where does the money go that I send to those in need?. If we have so much why do some people have nothing still?. Why do I feel frantic when I first wake up in the morning?. Why do you say you are spiritual yet you treat people like shit?. How can you say you're close to god and yet you talk behind. My back as though I am not a part of you?. Why do I say I'm fine when it's obvious I'm not?. Why's it so hard to tell you what I want?. Why can't you just read my mind?. Why do I fear that the quieter I am the. less you will listen?. Why do I care whether you like me or not?. Why is it so hard for me to be angry?. Why is it such work to stay conscious and. So easy to get stuck and not the other way around?. Will I ever move back to canada?. Can I be with a lover with whom I am a student and. a master?. Why am I encouraged to shut my mouth when it gets too. close to home?. Why cannot I live in the moment?
this grudge,"Fourteen years, thirty minutes. Fifteen seconds I've held this grudge. Eleven songs, four full journals. Thoughts of punishment I've expended. Not in contact, not a letter. Such communication, telepathic. You've been vilified. Used as fodder. You deserve a piece of every record. But who's it hurting now?. Who's the one that's stuck?. Who's it torturing now. With an antique knot in her stomach?. I wanna be big and let go. Of this grudge that's grown old. All this time I've not known. How to rest this bygone. I wanna be soft and resolved. Clean of slate and released. I wanna forgive for the both of us. Like an abandoned house. Dusty covered, furniture still intact. If I visit it now. Will I simply re-live it. Somehow gratuitous. But who's still aching now?. Who's tired of her own voice?. Who is it weighing down. With no gift from time of said healing. I wanna be big and let go. Of this grudge that's grown old. All this time I've not known. How to rest this bygone. I wanna be soft and resolved. Clean of slate and released. I wanna forgive for the both of us. Maybe as I cut the cord. Veils will lift from my eyes. Maybe as I lay this to rest. Dead weight off my shoulders will rise. Here I sit much determined. Ever ill-equipped to draw this curtain. How this has entertained validated. And has served me greatly ever the victim. But who's done whining now?. Who's ready to put down. This load I've carried longer than. I had cared to remember. I wanna be big and let go. Of this grudge that's grown old. For the life of me I've not known. How to rest this bygone. I wanna be soft and resolved. Clean of slate and released. I wanna forgive for the both of us."
today,"I've fallen down, Joan of Arc ailing. Systems are failing the mission. I've been taken down, wind from my sails. By tempers that flared and were vicious. I'm going down down down. I'm going down down down. Unless we start a revolution. Awaken from this frozen. Start the mending of our union. Today. Unless we revive this constitution. From sure disintegration. Live out this revelation. Today. Smile upside down, rupture is rising. Families are scrambling for custody. Faithlessly drowned. The chase of this dollar is tilting my altar t'ward apathy. We're going down down down. We're going down lest we move to new ground. Unless we start a revolution. Awaken from this frozen. Start the mending of our union. Today. Unless we revive this constitution. From sure disintegration. Live out this revelation. Today. Warm'd by this fire born from a flicker. My heart moves slower than technology. This dampened desire is rolling its sleeves up. Replaced by a vigor and empathy. I'm reaching higher and higher and higher. I'm moving up and up and up. As we bandy round solution. Celebrate our evolution. That antidotes our stations. Today. And as we activate our nation. As we're joined by our companions. We ignite our generation. Today"
too hot,"Chorus:. Always too hot never too cold. You make your best shot too hot to hold. Never too young. Never too old. You gotta go for gold. Hey boy you wanted all or nothin'. Lose the apprehension baby. And go with the flow cause you know you've got. Stand up if you want the answers. You need to blast 'em straight up baby. So say what you mean and you mean to say now. Hey you don't have to go and prove it. You just go ahead and do it. Your time is for the takin', makin'. the best of what you got now. Repeat Chorus. Don't care what they say about ya. You never throw a hero party. For those who oppose who you chose to be now. Maybe you could feel the power. It's like a bomb inside your head that blows if you're. slow when you go to use it. You, you gotta show them that you mean it just go ahead and scream it. And show them what they're missin' listen. to what your heart could tell ya. Repeat Chorus (x2). You gotta go for gold and you'll make it baby. Gold! And when you're there you gotta. Throw your hands in the air. And wave 'em like you just don't care. Reachin' teachin' practice what you're preachin'. Throw your hands in the air. And wave 'em like you just don't care. Movin' provin' everything you're doin'. Repeat Chorus. You, you don't have to go and prove it. You just go ahead and do it. Your time is for the takin', makin'. the best of what you got now. Always too hot. Never too cold. Give your best shot. Go with the flow cause you know you've got to. Repeat Chorus. ."
torch,"I miss your smell and your style and your pure abiding way. Miss your approach to life and your body in my bed. Miss your take on anything and the music you would play. Miss cracking up and wrestling and our debriefs at end of day. These are things that I miss. These are not times for the weak of heart. These are the days of raw despondence. I never dreamed I would have to lay down my torch for you like this. I miss your neck and your gait and your sharing what you write. Miss you walking through the front door documentaries in your hand. Miss traveling our traveling and your fun and charming friends. Miss our big sur getaways. And to watch you love my dogs. These are things that I miss. These are not times for the weak of heart. These are the days of raw despondence. I never dreamed I would have to lay down my torch for you like this. One step one prayer I soldier on, simulating moving on. I miss your warmth and the thought of us bringing up our kids. And the part of you that walks with your stick-tied handkerchief. These are things that I miss. These are not times for the weak of heart. These are the days of raw despondence. I never dreamed I would have to lay down my torch for you like this. These are things that I miss. These are not times for the weak of heart. These are the days of raw despondence. I never dreamed I would have to lay down my torch for you like this"

And you want to come visit me in California,. I would be open to spending time with you,. And finding out how old you were when you wrote your first. song.. Dear Jonathan, I liked you too much.. I used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me,. And think solely about themselves,. And you were plenty self-destructive for my taste at the time.. I used to say the more tragic the better.. The truth is, whenever I think of the early 90's,. Your face comes up with a vengeance like it was yesterday.. Dear Terrance, I love you muchly.. You've been nothing but open hearted,. And emotionally available and supportive,. And nurturing, and consummately there for me.. I kept drawing you in and pushing you away,. I remember how beautiful it was to fall asleep on your couch,. And cry in front of you for the first time.. You were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself.. What was wrong with me?. Dear Marcus, you rocked my world.. You had a charismatic way about you with the woman,. And you got me seriously thinking about spirituality.. And you wouldn't let me get away with kicking my own ass.. But I could never really feel relaxed,. And looked out for around you, though,. And that stopped us from going any further than we did.. And it's kinda too bad,. Because we could've had much more fun.. Dear Lou, we learned so much.. I realize we won't be able to talk for some time,. And I understand that as I do you.. The long distance thing was the hardest,. And we did as well as we could.. We were together during a very tumultuous time in our lives.. I will always have your back and be curious about you,. About your career,. Your whereabouts."

You can ask to live by yourself. Or love someone else and I'll support it.. You can ask for anything you want. Anything at all and I'll understand it.. And there are no strings attached. You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give.. You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have.. I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege,. And you owe me nothing in return.. I bet you're wondering when. the next payback shoe will eventually drop.. I bet you're wondering when. my conditional police will force you to cough up.. I bet you're wondering how. far you have now danced your way back into debt. This is the only kind of love. As I understand it that there really is.. You can express your deepest of thruths. Even if it means I'll lose you and I'll hear it.. You can fall into the abyss. On the way to your bliss. And I'll empathize with.. You can say that you'll have to skip town. To chase your passion and I'll hear it.. You can even hit a rock bottom. Have a mid-life crisis and I'll hold it. And there are no strings attached. You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give.. You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have.. I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege,. And you owe me nothing in return."
your congratulations,"I wouldn't have compromised as much.. So much of myself for fear of having you hating me.. I would've sung so loudly,. It would've cracked myself.. I became so self-conscious of anything exuberant.. I wouldn't have sold myself short.. I wouldn't have kept my eyes glued to the ground.. If I had've known my invisibility would not make a difference,. I would've run around screaming proudly at the top of my voice.. I wouldn't have said it was in fact luck,. I'm talking idealism here.. I would not have been so self-deprecating,. I wouldn't have cowered for fear of having my eyes scratched out.. I wouldn't have cut my comfort off.. I wouldn't have feigned needlessness.. I would not have discredited every one of their compliments.. It was your approval I wanted.. Your congratulations.."
your house,"I went to your house. Walked up the stairs. Opened the door without ringing the bell. Walked down the hall. Into your room where I could smell you. And I shouldn't be here. Without permission. Shouldn't be here.... Would you forgive me love, if I danced in your shower?. Would you forgive me love, if I laid in your bed?. Would you forgive me love, if I stay all afternoon?. I took off my clothes. Put on your robe. Went through your drawers. And I found your cologne. Went down to the den. Found your cd's. And I played your Joni. And I shouldn't stay long. You might be home soon. Shouldn't stay long. Would you forgive me love, if I danced in your shower?. Would you forgive me love, if I laid in your bed?. Would you forgive me love, if I stay all afternoon?. I burned your incense. I ran a bath. I noticed a letter that sat on your desk. It said:. ""Hello, love.. I love you so, love.. Meet me at midnight."". And no, it wasn't my writing. I'd better go soon. It wasn't my writing. So forgive me love If I cry in your shower. So forgive me love for the salt in your bed. So forgive me love If I cry all afternoon."
