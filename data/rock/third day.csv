cry out to jesus,"To everyone who's lost someone they love. Long before it was their time. You feel like the days you had were not enough. when you said goodbye. And to all of the people with burdens and pains. Keeping you back from your life. You believe that there's nothing and there is no one. Who can make it right. There is hope for the helpless. Rest for the weary. Love for the broken heart. There is grace and forgiveness. Mercy and healing. He'll meet you wherever you are. Cry out to Jesus, Cry out to Jesus. For the marriage that's struggling just to hang on. They lost all of their faith in love. They've done all they can to make it right again. Still it's not enough. For the ones who can't break the addictions and chains. You try to give up but you come back again. Just remember that you're not alone in your shame. And your suffering. When you're lonely. And it feels like the whole world is falling on you. You just reach out, you just cry out to Jesus. Cry to Jesus. To the widow who suffers from being alone. Wiping the tears from her eyes. For the children around the world without a home. Say a prayer tonight"

Oh, such a long time. Since i've lived with peace and rest. Now I am here, my destination. Guess things work out for the best.. And I know that my time is coming soon.. Who is this man? This man beside me. They call the king of the jews. They don't believe that he's the messiah. But, somehow I know it's true.. And they laugh at him in mockery,. And beat him till he bleeds. They nail him to the rugged cross,. And raise him, they raise him up next to me. My time has come, I'm slowly fading. I deserve what I receive. Jesus when you are in your kingdom. Could you please remember me. And he looks at me still holding on. The tears fall from his eyes. He says I tell the truth. Today, you will live with me in paradise. And I know that my time is coming soon. And I know that my time is coming soon. And I know paradise is coming soon."

i don't know,"Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day. From the recording: Come Together, Track #9.. Cannot find the words to say I'm sorry. Don't know how to show you I was wrong. Wasted all that you had given to me. Now I'm left with nothing and no one. And I find it's my fault. I'm the only one to blame. For the tears and the pain. I don't know what I can say. Or would it matter anyway. 'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me. For all that I have put you through. Is there anything that I can do. I would give my life to find your mercy. All my life has lead to this decision. To return and ask you this one thing. And if I had one chance or if a million. Would it ever be enough for me. To explain what I've done. Now I know that I was wrong. Will you hold me again. I don't know what I can say. Or would it matter anyway. 'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me. For all that I have put you through. Is there anything that I can do. I would give my life to find your mercy. What will it take until you forgive me. I don't know. And I find it's my fault. I'm the only one to blame. For the tears and the pain. I don't know what I can say. Or would it matter anyway. 'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me. For all that I have put you through.

don't say goodbye,"Lyrics by Mark Lee / Music by Third Day. From the recording: Time, Track #6.. Look outside, the autumn leaves are falling. Deep inside you hear the road is calling. And I know you want to walk away. And leave it all behind. You're running from nothing. Chasing lies can find you tired and jaded. And in your world the colors have all faded. If you think that you can find a place. To get away from the pain. You're looking for nothing. I hate to see you leave without a fight. Time will open doors for you. Wishes spent make dreams come true. I promise I'll be there. Don't say goodbye. Take my hand, let's walk a while together. Holding hands won't make love last forever. But I know you probably need someone. To help you work it out."

believe,"Never mind all the things you heard about me. You're never gonna understand it. Every time that I've given you the truth. It's never made a bit of difference. Disappointment takes you.

Hardened heart and blinded eye. All you need to do is just believe. Never mind what you think that you had seen. It all can change in just a moment. Here before you is all the proof you need. Why can't you ever just believe it?"

I could spend all of my time in the shade. of the trees and listen all day long. But you're ever hearing, never understanding. Ever seeing, not perceiving and your heart. has grown callous. You're in a storm and lost you way. Won't you fly to heaven and be saved today. Blackbird, now you're broken your wing. You try to fly high but you know that you. can't go anywhere, you can't do anything. Blackbird, who put you in your cage. Tell me, was it God or was it you. Was it me? I guess it don't matter anyway.

You say you talk to angels. Well I say it's such a lie"

I in my Savior am happy and blessed,. Watching and waiting, looking above,. Filled with his goodness, lost in his love."
blind,Each and every single day. I was throwing life away with questions. Searching for a better way. Always looking in the wrong direction. My heart I could not trust.

cry out to jesus,"To everyone who's lost someone they love. Long before it was their time. You feel like the days you had were not enough. when you said goodbye. And to all of the people with burdens and pains. Keeping you back from your life. You believe that there's nothing and there is no one. Who can make it right. There is hope for the helpless. Rest for the weary. Love for the broken heart. There is grace and forgiveness. Mercy and healing. He'll meet you wherever you are. Cry out to Jesus, Cry out to Jesus. For the marriage that's struggling just to hang on. They lost all of their faith in love. They've done all they can to make it right again. Still it's not enough. For the ones who can't break the addictions and chains. You try to give up but you come back again. Just remember that you're not alone in your shame. And your suffering. When you're lonely. And it feels like the whole world is falling on you. You just reach out, you just cry out to Jesus. Cry to Jesus. To the widow who suffers from being alone. Wiping the tears from her eyes. For the children around the world without a home. Say a prayer tonight"

for the rest of my life,Staring at the edge of a canyon. It all feels so far away. Somewhere it all went wrong. The sun has come and gone. I'm left here standing in the rain.

I would be waiting here forever. Chorus:. Your grace is never going to change. Your faith always will remain. Your love is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I see a world looking for an answer. but I don't know what for. When will we realize that we're sinners. in the hands of a loving God who came. and died and wants to set us free. How He longs to be with you and me. But if we waited on the truth to change."

That she was not faithful. She couldn't be. Foolishly More unfaithful if she tried. He did not care. Wanted her Despite lies and wandering eyes. He deserves the very best. But he loves her none the less. She's forgotten her first love (Maybe one day she'll return). He's forgotten that she ever went away and broke his heart. Lavished on Silver, gold, and anything she needed. Wasted thoughts Broken hearts. Love was not acknowledged. God only knows. That He has shown her. More love than she deserves. There will come a time. When she will find. That he's not there To give her love."

But I’ve got to keep moving on. I can’t stay in one place too long. Say a prayer for me. I’m gone. Thank you so much. You’ve been so kind. And I can’t say enough. Of all the places I’ve been. This is one. That I just don’t want to leave. Gone like the wind and I’m not sure. When I’m coming back, will you want more. God only knows where I am going. And just what tomorrow brings"
have mercy,"Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day. From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #6.. My will won't break, it barely bends. Same old sinner, the same old sin. On my knees to plead again. Confessions trial, where to begin?. Have mercy, on me a sinning man. Lord have mercy, on me a sinning man. If it's true that the wages of sin is death. Then I've earned quite enough to quit. The reward I deserve I'd surely get. Were it not for you to pay my debt. Oh, I don't think I can take this further. Oh, if it's not one thing it's another"
he is alive,"Angels are watching over us. With the saints that have gone on before us. And they join in a heavenly chorus. Singing ""he is alive, he is alive"". He is alive. Death is defeated. Sin has retreated. From the power of the son. And he is alive. The enemy is faded. The battle still rages. But the war has been won. The stars in the heavens rejoice. With the sun and the moon. And with all of the earth. Let all of creation now lift up their voice. Singing ""he is alive, he is alive"". Jesus is alive. Jesus is alive. He is alive. Death is defeated. Sin has retreated. From the power of the son. He is alive, he is alive. He is alive, he is alive. Jesus is alive. Jesus is alive"

how do you know?,"I’ve got my doubts and I’ve got my questions. It’s nothing new ‘cause I’ve seen them before. I’ve had my share of false revelations. It always seems they’re knockin’ on my door. You said that I should see the light. But sometimes faith is blind. How do you know, how do you know. What I’m suppose to be doing. Why do you go, why do you go on. Thinking you know my fate. So many times I’ve lost my step. But never lost my way. How do you know, how do you know. When I don’t know myself. You’re thinking that you’ve got all the answers. You’ve got my situation figured out. But you’re only seeing part of the picture. There’s so much more that you don’t know about. And here you come to speak your mind. But I’ll say one more time"
how's your head,"Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day. From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #3.. How's your head? I'm so sorry. That I can't do anything about it. Like I said, I'll be praying. Here without you I feel helpless. Sorry I had to go away. Tomorrow's just another day. without you here, I'll have to say. Hold on to love. How's your day? Do you miss me?. Right now I've only a minute. Called to say, I'm so sorry. And once again I feel helpless. God forbid we'd be apart. How close or shall I ask how far. are we until the demise of this helplessness."
i believe,"Give me something that i can belive and then i'll. Share it with the world for everyone to see. Take away the darkness, all the pain and sadness. I know it's you that put this light inside of me. I believe in a faith that's strong. I believe in a hope that carries on. I believe in this things and more. Most of all, most of all. I believe in love. If i had the strength to move a mountain. Would you be amazed by all of my abilities. I guess it would not mean much if i didn't have love. And this is what i really want you all to see"
i can feel it,"I seek the silence through the chaos and the noise. That’s when I’m listening; I want to hear Your voice. Sometimes it softly speaks, a whisper on the wind. Sometimes it’s louder when Your Spirit rushes in. . I can feel it all around me. I can feel it all around me. I keep on searching for Your presence in this place. I see your hand at work, I feel Your touch of grace. Sometimes it falls like rain upon this thirsty land. Sometimes You gently stir the heart of every man. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel Your heartbeat. I pray You’d send Your presence down,. send it down. Fill us with Your Spirit now"
i can't take the pain,"VERSE 1. No I didn’t see this one coming. Suddenly it snuck up on me. Well I can’t say you didn’t tell me so. Well I can’t say you didn’t warn me. CHORUS. Well I can’t take the pain of knowing that I left you. And I can’t bear the shame of knowing I was wrong. But I’ll take the blame for everything that I’ve done. But I can’t take the pain of leaving you alone. Leaving you alone. VERSE 2. Well I was there when they accused you. But I guess I was too afraid. Not just once, and not just twice. But three times I denied your name. CHORUS. Well I can’t take the pain of knowing that I left you. And I can’t bear the shame of knowing I was wrong. But I’ll take the blame for everything that I’ve done. But I can’t take the pain of leaving you alone. Leaving you alone. BRIDGE. Well I never thought I’d get even a second chance. But you gave me that and so much more. And then for every time I ever did deny. You asked me if I love you. You know I do Lord. VERSE 3. So I’m off to follow in your steps. It won’t be easy it’s safe to say. There are only two roads I can walk on down. The one less traveled is the one you take. CHORUS. Well I cant take the pain of knowing that I left you. And I can’t bear the shame of knowing I was wrong. But I’ll take the blame for everything that I’ve done. But I can’t take the pain of leaving you alone. But you took the pain even though I left you. And you took the shame and you made it all your own. Why’d you take the blame for everything that I’ve done. But you took the pain you and you alone, you and you alone. You and you alone."
i deserve?,"Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day. From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #5.. I tasted fruit that was forbidden. I murdered trust that you had given. And now I'm living in a place that's not my home. The pain in your heart made you regret. The moment we spoke, did you forget?. Will my transgressions bring us all to our sweet end?. Maybe I'm just being too hard on myself. I don't know. Or is it that your mercy is much more than I deserve?. Betrayed by more than just a kiss. I did much more I must admit."
i don't know,"Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day. From the recording: Come Together, Track #9.. Cannot find the words to say I'm sorry. Don't know how to show you I was wrong. Wasted all that you had given to me. Now I'm left with nothing and no one. And I find it's my fault. I'm the only one to blame. For the tears and the pain. I don't know what I can say. Or would it matter anyway. 'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me. For all that I have put you through. Is there anything that I can do. I would give my life to find your mercy. All my life has lead to this decision. To return and ask you this one thing. And if I had one chance or if a million. Would it ever be enough for me. To explain what I've done. Now I know that I was wrong. Will you hold me again. I don't know what I can say. Or would it matter anyway. 'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me. For all that I have put you through. Is there anything that I can do. I would give my life to find your mercy. What will it take until you forgive me. I don't know. And I find it's my fault. I'm the only one to blame. For the tears and the pain. I don't know what I can say. Or would it matter anyway. 'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me. For all that I have put you through. Is there anything that I can do. I would give my life to find your mercy. I don't know what I can say. Or would it matter anyway. 'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me. For all that I have put you through. Is there anything that I can do. I would give my life to find your mercy. What will it take until you forgive me. Oh Lord, will I find that you have already."
i got a feeling,"I got a message. I got a song. Can I get a witness. Tell me what’s going on. I’ll show the people. A better way. Maybe I will tomorrow. Maybe I will today. . ‘Cause I got a feeling it won’t be long. Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong. But I know one thing for sure. Only time will tell it. I got a feeling coming over me. Nothing else here can set me free. But I know one thing for sure. Well, I’ve got to show it. . I got a mission. I got a sign. Is anybody listening. I gotta make sure this time. I’ll tell the people.

i got you,"Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day. From the recording: Come Together, Track #8.. What kind of song do you want to sing for me?. Is it slow or is it rock and roll?. What kind of day do you want to bring to me?. Rain or shine, I would be just fine. 'Cause I've got everything I need. I got everything. I got everything. I got you and you're putting it all together. And it doesn't get any better as far as I can tell. I got you right now and ever after. And it doesn't even really matter. That I've got nothing else. 'Cause I got you. Where do I go when I want to know the truth?. It isn't me, well it's only you. When will I know what you have for me to do?. Is it now or is it coming soon?. Be it pleasure or be it pain. I'm ready for whatever life may bring. 'Cause I know that in the end. Everything works together. For the good of those who love Him"
i know you can,"Give me the words to say. Bring me the strength to stand. Take all the doubt away. Jesus, I know you can. For if I'm to follow you. It's only by your hand. Help me to make it through.

You ask and I will go. Lord, will you be there with me. I gotta know, I gotta know"
i need a miracle,"Late one night she started to cry. And Thought ""He ain't coming home"". She was tired of the lies. Tired of the fight. But she didn't wanna see him go. She fell on her knees and said. I haven't prayed since I was young. But ""Lord above, I need a miracle"". Well, no matter who you are. And no matter what you've done. There will come a time. When you can't make it on your own. And in your hour of desperation. Know you're not he only one. Prayin' ""Lord above, I need a miracle"". I need a miracle. He lost his job and all he had. In the fall of '09. Now he feared the worst,. That he would lose his children and his wife. So he drove down deep into the woods. And thought he'd end it all. And prayed ""Lord above, I need a miracle"". Well, no matter who you are. And no matter what you've done. There will come a time. When you can't make it on your own. And in your hour of desperation. Know you're not the only one. Prayin' ""Lord above, I need a miracle"". I need a miracle. He turned on the radio. To hear a song for the last time. He didn't know what he was looking for. Or even what he'd find. And the song he heard it gave him hope. And strength to carry on. And on that night. They found a miracle. They found a miracle. And in your hour of desperation. Know you're not the only one. Prayin' ""Lord above, I need a miracle"". ""Lord above, I need a miracle"""

i want to believe in you,"Time has kept me waiting. Anticipating for something more. And life has kept me looking. But I'm not certain what I'm searching for. Faith is like the sunlight in my eyes. In my eyes. It can light the way. But then sometimes. It is so blinding. Heaven let your light shine down on me. Open up my eyes so I can see. Give me some faith so I believe in something. Heaven let your light shine down on me. Open up my eyes so I can see. Give me some faith so I believe in something. Hope is sometimes fading. But there'll be a day when it fades no more. Love, it lasts forever. Maybe that's what we're all looking for. Faith, just like the sunshine in my eyes. It burns so bright. It can light the way. But then sometimes. It is so blinding. I want to believe in something. I want to believe in You. I want to believe in something. I want to believe in You. I want to believe in faith and hope and life and dreams.

I will hold my head high. . . I know you said it'd be okay. Sometimes I question just the same. I wonder if my problems are too small. Then I look back and realize. All your pain and sacrifice. Oh and how you suffered for us all. Beat me up and drag me down. I'll never be afraid. Beat me up and drag me down. And lock me in or keep me out. Whatever they may throw at me. I'll turn into a song for you
i've always loved you,"I don’t know how to explain it. But I know the words would hardly do. Miracles and signs and wonders. Aren’t enough for me to prove to you. Don’t you know I’ve always loved you. Even before there was time. Though you turn away. I tell you still. Don’t you know I’ve always loved you. And I always will. Greater love has not a man. Than the one who gives his life to prove. That he would do anything. And that’s what I’m gonna do for you. Don’t you know I’ve always loved you. Even before there was time. Though you turn away. I tell you still. Don’t you know I’ve always loved you. And I always will. Don’t you know I’ve always loved you. Even before there was time. Though you turn away. I tell you still.

love heals your heart,Did you think you were immune to this. Did you think you could escape without infection. You do all you’re able to resist. Just to avoid the danger of rejection. Memory warns you of the past. When it all went wrong. When you think your life is shattered. And there’s no way to be fixed again. Love heals your heart. At a time you least expected. You’re alive like you have never been. Love heals your heart. Everybody has a wall to climb. That was built to guard the pain that holds them captive. Every smile that they would hide behind. Will try to mask the hurt beneath the surface. Sometimes it’s hard to understand. How we’re trapped inside

san angelo,San Angelo. words by Mac Powell / music by Third Day. Forever seems so distant. Much further than today. You turn around and in an instant. You find that you are just as far from yesterday. The day it feels like winter. The night it feels like stone. You turn around and you remember. When you’re surrounded. You can still feel so alone. But it’s in between the start and end. I find myself once again. Questioning this place. Calling out your name. San Angelo. What do you know. And tell me do you have something to say. Don’t get me wrong. But I miss my home. And it feels like I’m a million miles away. San Angelo. Why do I ask these questions. How come I have these doubts. Cause I find every situation. It always seems to have. It’s way of working out. But it’s in between the start and end. I find myself once again. Questioning this place. Calling out your name. ©.2004 Consuming Fire Music / ASCAP.

saved,"I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined. Stone-cold as I stepped out of the womb. By His grace I have been touched. By His word I have been healed. By His hand I've been delivered. By His spirit I've been sealed. Now I've been saved by the blood of the Lamb. I'm saved by the blood of the Lamb. And I'm so glad. Yes, I'm so glad. Now I'm so glad (So glad). I want to thank you, Lord. I just want to thank you, Lord. Thank You, Lord (Thank You, Lord). By His truth I can be upright. By His strength I can endure. By His power I've been lifted. In His love I am secure. He bought me with a price. Freed me from the pit. Full of emptiness and wrath. And the fire that burns in it. Nobody to rescue me. Nobody would dare. I was going down for the last time. But by His mercy I've been spared. Not by works. But by faith in Him who called. For so long I've been hindered. For so long I've been stalled."
she sings in riddles,"From the recording: Southern Tracks, Track #3.. The voice of an angel, I cannot tell. Light or darkness, heaven or hell. The smile of a believer, wedged and bound. Friend or deceiver, the truth or a lie. Chorus:. She sings in riddles, she sings in rhymes. Say everything and nothing at the same time. Still there's something to loose my mind. She sings in riddles, she sings in rhymes. Words of a poet, in perfect time. With Christians and answeres,. Every verse, every line. But I smile and I wonder, is there a song. I'm not always silent.. Is it right, is it wrong?. . ."

And I know I'll never be the same. Show me Your glory. Send down Your presence. I want to see Your face. Show me Your glory. Majesty shines about You. I can't go on without You, Lord. When I climb down the mountain. And get back to my life. I won't settle for ordinary things. I'm gonna follow You forever. And for all of my days. I won't rest 'til I see You again.

Sky falls down. It crumbles into the sea. The sun goes out. He's coming back for me. I'll be found at the place. Where the gravity leaves the ground. I won't be comin' down.

still listening,"Lyrics by Mac Powell/Music by Third Day. From the recording: Come Together, Track #7.. There was a time when I thought that I had you. figured out. I told you before and I'll say once more. Now and then I have my doubts. I'll never pretend to know what you are doing. It's true that you move in mysterious ways. I looked for you in. The fire and the wind. But you weren't there as far as I could see. I thought I'd hear you shout. But then I figured it out. That all along you're whispering to me. And I'm still listening. Just when I thought that I had caught a glimpse of. who you are. You taught me a lesson I needed to learn. Right from the very start. I never will be the man that I quite need to be. But that's alright 'cause you're enough for me."
surrender,"When the day began. And you opened up your eyes. No, you didn’t recognize. What you were seeing. Then it all came back. You remembered where you’ve been. Well, it never seems to end. And you’re still running. Will you ever change your mind. You’re almost out of time. You better give up. Gotta stop running. It’s the end of the line. It’s time to surrender. Hands up. Turn it around. Fall to the ground. Are you gonna surrender. Now the day is done. And you want to close your eyes. And pretend that you are fine. But you’d be lying. And you want it back. The life that you once had. ‘Cause inside you find. That you are slowly dying"
'til the day i die,"I wanna tell you. I wanna tell you just how I feel. I will show you. I will show you my love is real. Nobody’s ever gonna love you like I am. You never can deny that. Nobody’s ever gonna hold you like I am. I’ll love you ‘til I die. Until the day I die. I said “forever”. I said “forever” and I mean it. I made a promise. And I intend to always keep it. Forever is so far beyond the reach of my mind. So I’ll give all I have, my heart, my love, my life…"

Take it all. Cause I can't take it any longer. All I have, I can?t make it on my own. Take the first, take the last. Take the good and take the rest. Here I am, all I have. Take it all. All the roads that lie before me. All the struggles I go through. Every second I'm reminded. That it all belongs to you. Now I'm ready. To let it go. To give it away. Ever since I died to myself. You gave a better life to me. I give you my finest moment. I give you the last breath I breathe"
take me back,"It's your heart that keeps you running. And it's your mind that I can't change. Will you ever be returning. And coming back again, coming back again. Take me back to the place where it started. Take me back to the warmth of the sun. To the place where the rivers meet the ocean. Take me back home. Yeah, that's where I belong. And have you ever really wondered. As we walk beneath the stars. Will we find the truth, will we discover. It isn't very far, it's not so very far. I wonder if I've gone too far.

take my life,"Lyrics & Music by Mac Powell. From the recording: Third Day, Track #11.. How many times have I turned away. The number is the same as the sand on the shore.

How many times have I turned away. The number is the same as the stars in the sky. But every time You've taken me back. And now I pray You do it tonight.."
thank you all,"Ready or not, well, here we go. Giving all we got like it's our LAST show. 'Cause I guess you'll never know. What's gonna happen?. In the sunshine or driving rain. Hit the ground running like a big 'ol train. 'Cause we don't know. When we're comin' back again. Chorus:. Thank you all for the good times that you bring. For the songs sound much better when you sing. Thank you all most of for listening. So this song says, ""Thank you All"". Ready or not, well, here we go. Where are we headed I don't know?. Could tomorrow be as good as it was today?. Riding in a bus down the interstate. Got another show in another place. But we won't forget you when we've gone away. Chorus. When all is said and done. And all the lights are faded. We'll thank the Lord above for this moment. Chorus"
that's how the story goes,"In the beginning you created,. The heavens and the earth and everything was good,. You created man according to your perfect plan,. And everyday we walked with you in life was paradise,. Then things became more complicated,. Pride entered the picture and did what it could,. Tried to make us think that we could make it on our own,. And now we’re feeling so alone cos' we believed the lie,. Since the fateful day we turned our backs on you,. You’ve been trying to win our hearts so we’d come back to you.. That’s how the story goes. Sounds strange but its true. The world’s fallen but your love broke through. That’s how the story goes. You loved this world so much you saved it,. You came down to earth and in our place you stood,. Showed us how to live and then you paid the sacrifice,. And took our sins upon you, then you died to give us life.. Then you conquered death, but that is not the end,. I know in my heart that someday you’ll come back again.. That’s how the story goes. Sounds strange but its true. The world’s fallen but your love broke through. That’s how the story goes. And in the final chapter we all have a part to play,. We must take this story out into the world today!. That’s how the story goes. Sounds strange but its true. The world’s fallen but your love broke through. That’s how the story goes. It goes on and on and on. It goes on and on and on. It goes on and on and on. That’s how the story goes"

the first noel,"The First Noel, the Angels did say. Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay. In fields where they lay keeping their sheep. On a cold winter's night that was so deep.. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!. They looked up and saw a star. Shining in the East beyond them far. And to the earth it gave great light. And so it continued both day and night.. Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!"

the sun is shining,"Yesterday I found. That everything I knew was wrong. It was upside down. The life I thought I had was gone. But You came and whispered love to me. And You gave me strength to carry on. Oh, the sun is shining. There is hope for me again. A new day’s dawning. The sun is shining. Yesterday I lost. Everything I had and loved. Then I cried out for You, Lord. And You came and picked me up. And the sorrow lasted through the night. But the joy came with the morn. I will lift my voice. No, I won’t be silent. For You heard my cry. And You turned my mourning into dancing. And so forever I’ll sing"

I'm never gonna give up fighting. I'm never gonna stop. Until I'm done. And even if it costs my life. You'll see me when the kingdom comes. [Repeat Chorus]
these thousand hills,"These thousand hills roll ever on. Footprints of a mighty God. They bring me to my knees in praise. Amazing love amazing grace. Was on a hill my Savior died. A broken heart and bleeding side. Hill of the Skull, Mount Calvary. The blood He shed, He shed for me. When Heaven's hills at last I roam. Forever settled in my home. I'll join the saints around your throne. Your kingdom, Lord, rolls ever on. La La La La La La La La ( x7 ). These thousand hills roll ever on. Footprints of a mighty God. They bring me to my knees in praise. Amazing love amazing grace. These thousand hills roll ever on. Ripples of the coming storm. The morning star precedes the dawn. These thousand hills roll ever on. La La La La La La La La ( x7 )."
thief,"I am a thief, I am a murderer. Walking up this lonely hill. What have I done? I don't remember. No one knows just how I feel. And I know that my time is coming soon.. It's been so long. Oh, such a long time. Since i've lived with peace and rest. Now I am here, my destination. Guess things work out for the best.. And I know that my time is coming soon.. Who is this man? This man beside me. They call the king of the jews. They don't believe that he's the messiah. But, somehow I know it's true.. And they laugh at him in mockery,. And beat him till he bleeds. They nail him to the rugged cross,. And raise him, they raise him up next to me. My time has come, I'm slowly fading. I deserve what I receive. Jesus when you are in your kingdom. Could you please remember me. And he looks at me still holding on. The tears fall from his eyes. He says I tell the truth. Today, you will live with me in paradise. And I know that my time is coming soon. And I know that my time is coming soon. And I know paradise is coming soon."
third engine,"The sky grows bigger every day. And the other week I hopped on a train. Cutting through state lines. To come to you as the crow flies. And out there in there offing everything was melon and orange. Did you know, my sweet. That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?. I rolled over and over. Trying to touch your knees underneath the sheets. I just want you to know. that every pool of water reminds me of you. Is that all right?. I hope you think it's cool. 'Cause sometimes a train can't go as fast as I want it to. Everything seemed a little easier. when we weren't one hundred miles apart. The person across from me. sitting in her train seat, reminded me of you. And I looked out past her cheeks. through the glass-light conduit. But the sun had sunk already. Disappeared into New Jersey. Oh, why don't they have phones on these things?"
this is who i am,"I'm a son of a good man. I'm the child of an angel. I'm the brother of a wild one. And I'm looking for direction. I'm the lover of a beauty. I'm the father of blessings. I'm a singer of a love song. But is that all I'm good for. This is who I am. This is who I am. So take me and make me something so much more. This is who I am. This is who I am. So change me and make me someone better than before. I'm a saint and a sinner. I'm a lover and a fighter. I'm a true believer, with great. desire. I'm a preacher of grace, prophet of love,. teacher of truth. I've fallen down so many times. But here I stand in front of you. This is who I am. This is who I am. So take me and make me something so much more. This is who I am. This is who I am. So change me and make me someone better than before. Take me as I am. But please don't leave me that way. 'Cause I know that you can. Make me better than I am today"
this song was meant for you,"Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day. From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #9.. Where did I go wrong?. Tell me what I have done here. It didn't take too long. For the sun to disappear. Now it's gone and I'm alone. This song was meant for you. It had a happy ending. But you had to change your mind. I don't know what happened. Thought that you would never leave. Is a song forever. Life for you will surely change. Maybe for the better. None of this turned out. Quite the way I had planned it. But I know that in the end. It will work out for the best. Still you're gone. You never know what the future holds for you. But of all I have heard this on thing's true. Nothing can separate us from God's love. In our lives there is abound to come some pain. Surely as there are storms and falling rain. Just believe that the one who holds the storms. Will bring the sun"
time's running out on me,"There's so many places I wanna see. So many things that I wanna be. But time's running out on me. There's so many places I gotta go. So many things that I need to know.

Are you gonna help me find the strength to carry on. 'Cause time's running out on me, yeah. Time's running out on me. There's so many things that I've yet to do. So many things that I need to prove. But time's running out on me. So many things that I need to say. But I let the words get in the way. And time's running out on me, yeah. Time's running out on me, yeah. Time is running out on me. Now the end is near. Time's running out on me"
took my place,"Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day. From the recording: Time, Track #3.. Lost like a little child. Helpless as a baby. Searchin' desperately to find. Someone who could save me.

Blamed like a criminal."

And forfeit his soul. What good is it a man. To gain the whole world. And forfeit his soul. Poor old soul, he got more. Than the kings of a thousand countries. What he owns ain't silver or gold.

who i am,"Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day. From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #10.. I need to be someone who's a lot like you. Easy to see that I sure need something new. Though I try to live life my way. I think it goes to prove. That I need to be someone who's like you. And I know that you want to change me. Want to rearrange the way I feel inside. Yes, I've heard that you take. The broken hearts of lonely souls. And you make all things right. Do you know who I am?. Have you seen the things I've done?. Never before, no there's never been a time. That I would implore you to take what's yours and mine. And to use it in the way you will. In any way you find. Never before did I realize"
wire,"Turn on the spotlight, strike up the band. Everyone’s looking my way. They came to see the excitement firsthand. And hear all that I’ve got to say. Oh, it makes me wonder What if I slip, will they catch me. Or watch me fall?. I am walking on a wire. I tiptoe in through the fire. Never looking down to see that. I am walking on a wire. The pressure’s getting higher. But I don’t look around. Everyone roots for the winner. The others well maybe next time. Your time at the top only lasts fifteen minutes. Then they just leave you behind. Oh, it makes me wonder What if I slip, will they catch me. Or watch me fall?. I am walking on a wire. I tiptoe in through the fire. Never looking down to see that. I am walking on a wire. The pressure’s getting higher. But I don’t look around. It’s so far to the ground"
you are mine,It doesn’t take much. For my heart to break. And you have done it. For what’s seems the millionth time. Whenever I hear. Of your saving grace. And how you gave your life. In exchange for mine. Sometimes I wonder why you even love me. And why you ever chose to call me child. Then I remember. It’s by your sacrifice. I can say that. I am yours and you are mine. It doesn’t take much. For me to shed a tear. And you have done so many things. To make me cry. Whenever I think. Of all that I’ve done wrong. And everything that you have done. To make it right. It doesn’t take much. For my heart to break. And you have done it. For what’s seems the millionth time

My world was changed. From the moment that I saw your face. My life has finally begun. You are my everything. (whe I'm lost in the dark). You are my everything. (when I'm falling apart).

you make me mad,"Lyrics by Mac Powell / Music by Third Day. From the recording: Conspiracy No. 5, Track #2.. I don't know if it's necessarily. (The things you do). Maybe the things you say. Or maybe just the way you say it. It's true you sing a pretty song indeed. (In a new way). You've said some things to me. But I'm not sure if you really mean it. Do you realize what you have done?. Do you think we have a problem?. You make me dance, you make me cry, you make me mad. You make me shout, you make me smile, you make me mad. You make me sing, you make me think, you make me sad. You make me fall, you make me love, you make me mad. I don't see calling it a tradgedy. (What have you done). To do so would be wrong. And I think taking things too far. But I admit that in reality. (The truth be known). I don't listen to words. But I know all of them by heart. Do you realize what you have done?. Do you think we have a problem?."
