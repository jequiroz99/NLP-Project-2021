To comfort us(Our deepest sacred lies and we both know we are the suspects of the crime and running from our darkest hour). {Instrumental w/ scream}. I've seen the sketch in black and white. I've seen the face you've tried to hide. Our screams inside(They watch our backs...). To comfort us(OUr deepest sacred lies). (I've seen the sketch in black and white.... I've seen the face you've tried to hide.... Expect no consequence.... Maybe all lies will pass the test...)
stuck underneath,"If I was gone then would you see. Harder I try, more you wanna leave. I may seem strong, but that’s the surface you see. I’m hiding inside, I’m stuck underneath"
surface,"I hide beneath the surface. Can't let you see the truth. Where these fall tight before you. This pain's nothing new. Have I lost my mind?. Have I lost my mind?. Or have I found my way out. As everything falls away. I'm finally waking up. Been waiting for a change. I've been lost for long enough. I've wasted so much time I'm done. Been waiting for a change. I've been lost for long enough. Feels like I'm close to breaking. These chains that prison me. Locked up, locked up. I can barely breathe. Have I lost my mind?. Have I lost my mind?. Or have I found my way out. As everything falls away. I'm finally waking up. Been waiting for a change. I've been lost for long enough. I've wasted so much time I'm done. Been waiting for a change. I've been lost for long enough. Under the surface (under the surface [x3] ). As everything falls away. I'm finally waking up. Been waiting for a change. To lift me up. As everything falls away. I'm finally waking up. Been waiting for a change. I've been lost for long enough. I've wasted so much time I'm done. Been waiting for a change. I've been lost for long enough"
the forbidden line,"We walk past the forbidden line. In hopes of finding. A further distance. A further distance. All these thoughts are what braught. Darkness to our day. We'll always live alone. Under the surface of shame. Tell me your lies staring you dead in the eyes. I know that. The truth is beleeding out. No use in hiding now. Truth is bleeding when will you be found. We are all tempted to cross the forbidden line. Stripped of our senses. We struggle between wrong and right. Deceit in disguise you won't get pass their ties. You've dug your grave to far deep. Deceit in disguise will never get you by. You've dug your grave to fucking deep. You'll never find what you're looking for. We'll never find what we're looking for. They know who you are. Seen what you've done. They konw who you are zero to none. So brew up the lies. Say goodbye. We are all tempted to cross the forbidden line. Stripped of our senses. We struggle between wrong and right. Deceit in disguise you won't get pass their ties. You've dug your grave to far deep. Deceit in disguise will never get you by. You've headed away, away, away. From the light. No one belives no one. No one will trust us sinners. No one can hear no one. Can hear us singing. What is beliving when there is nothing left to belive in?. We are all tempted to cross the forbidden line. Stripped of our senses. We struggle between wrong and right. Deceit in disguise you won't get pass their ties. You've dug your grave to far deep. Deceit in disguise will never get you by. You've headed away, away, away. From the light"
the hollow,"I crave the day this curse releases me of all my rage. I seek a remedy. The night is young but I've become a prisoner in this story. I want to live. Or is love just an empty dream?. Running towards a light, chasing so quickly, changing with the night. Behind the city wall, the hollow holds him down. I'm on the hunt. No one's safe to walk these streets. Out for blood, let them come. Make a monster out of me. I can't escape the monster that they see. I will remain until the day I meet the girl with eyes. Who sees behind what they try fooling her to see. But is she real?. Or is love just an empty dream?. Running towards a light, chasing so quickly, changing with the night. Behind the city wall, the hollow holds him down. I'm on the hunt. No ones safe to walk these streets. Out for blood, let them come. Make a monster out of me. She'll burn the hollow. She'll spread the secrecy. She'll tell the story of the villain that they see. She'll burn the hollow. She'll spread the secrecy. She'll tell the story of the villain that they see. She'll burn the hollow. She'll spread the secrecy. She'll tell the story of the villain that they see. She'll burn the hollow. She'll spread the secrecy. She'll tell the story but this love is just an empty dream. Running towards a light, chasing so quickly, changing with the night. Behind the city wall, the hollow holds him down. Holds him down"
the listening,"Strike the ground. There's not a message in the sound. Hold out your hands. When your God's not listening. Best believe, best believe. You'll be systematically. Placed to die tomorrow. With a taste, so sweet. It could drain the sorrow, the sorrow. We're living through your eyes. But inside we start to die. We count our losses. Strike the ground. There's not a message in the sound. Hold out your hands. When your God's not listening. The common ground of a modern day escape. Is calling for the listening. You can't pull your way. Through the same situations. Time and time again. You place your pawns in straight lines. Alone to buy time. Will we find the end, find the end?. We're living through your eyes. But inside we start to die. We count our losses.. Making the wrong moves. Hoping you'll make them right. We raise our voices in time. Strike the ground. There's not a message in the sound. Hold out your hands. When your God's not listening. The common ground of a modern day escape. Is calling for the listening.. Where will you turn. When your God has abandoned you?. Where will you turn. When he leaves you to die?. Where will you turn. When your God has abandoned you?. Where will you turn. When he leaves you to die?. We pray for God. Strip the structure. Scratch it out. We praise empty skies. Strike the ground. There's not a message in the sound. Hold out your hands. When your God's not listening. The common ground of a modern day escape. Is calling for the listening. We're living through your eyes. But inside we start to die"

untitled,I can see your face. Your eyes on the walls. Your eyes on the walls. Your letters and the places. I wish that you'd call. I wish that you would call. Chicago seems so far. But I can feel the wind. And I can smell your car. And I can hear the kids are playing their favorite games without me. I'd Loved to be. Back where I belong. Like a homeless week. I couldn't sleep at all. I couldn't sleep at all. And I've tried everything. Friends to alcohol. Friends to alcohol. I'm Arizona's fault. Feel like defeat. I'm breaking down in holes. Trying not to slip. But Sd is taking it's toll on me. Love to be back where I belong. Woah oh belong. Back where I belong. Woah oh belong. Back where I belong. Woah oh belong
violent kiss,"I can't keep pacing. I need your blood tonight. (you're so far from me). And I'm so weak inside. Come fly to me, i'll show you what it's like. (when the full moon shines).

Take my hand, grip it tightly(don't let go). I promise pain will pass you silently. Take my hand, grip it tightly(don't let go). With your neck, i'll kiss you violently. To kiss my lips will leave you cold tonight. (you'll need my blood). And i'll devote my life. Come fly to me, i'll show you what it's like. (when the full moon shines). We'll stop hearts together.

wake me up,"Paint the target where you like it. You've got everything you've ever wanted. It's not my fault that I dug a grave so deep. Lying at the bottom, and I'm looking up. She's all I see, she's all I see. I'm slipping further down a path I thought I'd never lead. I've got a vacant heart that's pulsing to a broken beat. He's sinking deeper now, where are your hands? How could you do this dear?. How could you leave him here?. Lies seeping through his skin just itching to reveal truth. There's a bottle at his side. Burning as he takes a drink, he takes a drink. He swallows with his pride. Chasing down and breaking, breaking. Self destruction never felt so sweet. Wake me up, wake me up. There's an ending I'm afraid to see. Manipulations got its strings tied tightly around my wrists. A soft heart and a softer spine trapped me in her grip. She spun a web around me so tight I could barely breathe. Finished me with three words, a lie she whispered through her teeth. A four letter lie. Closet full of memories. No hate in his eyes till he find he's drowning. There's no hate in his eyes till he drowns in his lies as he takes a drink. There's a bottle at his side. Burning as he takes a drink, he takes a drink. He swallows with his pride. Chasing down and breaking, breaking. Self destruction never felt so sweet. Wake me up, wake me up. There's an ending I'm afraid to see. Your time is up, enough of the lies and sympathy. Don't make a promise you're going to break. It's not over, I'm nowhere near defeat. Who is the victim now?. I've got more spine now than you think. He's overcoming this without your hands. Now that his past has cleared, now you can leave him here. Lies seeped through his skin to release him to see the truth. There's a bottle at his side. Burning as he takes a drink, he takes a drink. He swallows with his pride. Chasing down and breaking, breaking. Self destruction never felt so sweet. Wake me up, wake me up. There's an ending I'm afraid to see. I'm afraid to see"
