Tryinto get her alone.. She hangs out on the corner. Cause nobody's home.. All she ever wanted. was a place on this earth. She shouts for a savior. For anyone to hear her. All she ever needed. Was hope in a world. In a world where she feels all alone. cause nobody's home. She cries for attention. Hanging on by a thread.. She can't stop the screaming. going on in her head.. Tears on the pillow. These are things she won't miss. Nothing to believe in. So it comes down to this.. Blood on the mirror,. Temptation is bliss.. Pills on the table,. She just couldn't resist.. Now nobody's home.. All she ever wanted. was a place on this earth. She shouts for a savior. For anyone to hear her. All she ever needed. Was hope in a world. In a world where she feels all alone. cause nobody's home.."

all for nothing,I was walking down the street doing nothing. When she ran right into me and I was wondering. If it could be that she didn't see. But she spit that hatred at my face. I felt like I wanted to fight. When I saw her hungry eyes and broken heart. And recognized her pain. I saw it I know it and I walked away. Only love could save her anyway. I can't believe all the times that we bleed. That it's all for nothing. I will deny all the tears that we cry. That it's all for nothing. Sometimes I feel so confused when I look at us. And all we went through. After eight years of sharing every dream together. We don't even talk. Is that all there is. What we stood up for. Now we stand behind a million locked doors. And we can't even say that we'll be friends. Sometimes things just change and we don't know why. I don't think I'll swallow that kind of lie. I can't believe all the times that we bleed. That it's all for nothing. I will deny all the tears that we cry. That it's all for nothing. Do we all want to believe there's more to this. Than the lights just turning out. Now we gotta have a real conversation even if we don't. Know each other's situation. Who says we're powerless just because of all the injustice. There's still time to fight. You just gotta go you just gotta try. You're the only one that's standing in your way. Sometimes things keep changin' we don't know why. Don't think I'll swallow that kind of lie. I can't believe all the times that we bleed. That it's all for nothing. I will deny all the tears that we cry. That it's all for nothing.

back to nowhere,"If you could have told me. I wouldn't find my way back home. Never would have closed the door I. Never would have left the phone unplugged. All night. Waiting for the sunrise to take me out of here. Back to nowhere. Wish you could have told me. Who knows if I, could have heard. Love don't make the reasons why. Some people just don't find the words to convey. The truth. Of the passion that they're feeling. Why do I keep falling back?. Back to nowhere. Wishing you could hold me. Like you used to in the dark. Lay your body next to mine. But does it anywhere, does your star. Are you sure, you're fine. But in case it's me you're missing. You should know I'd gladly go. Back to somewhere. Back to anywhere. I go. With you."

bored with myself,I'm just a little defensive. But I'll be o.k. tomorrow. This happens once in awhile. 'Till I'm back on my feet. Once I get out of bed. I'll come to my senses. Feed my head. A double shot of caffeine. A pair of shades can change it all. Maybe Superman will jump the wall. Whatever it takes to get on with the world. 'Cuz I'm bored with myself. So very bored with myself. More and more everyday. And I wonder if Marilyn ever felt this way. We're moving so fast. Why do I feel so empty. There's clothes in my closet. But nothing to wear. It's a mysterious thing. The more that I acquired. The less hungry I am but not more satisfied. There's India where I can chant. Therapy to rave and rant. Whatever it takes to distract me from being so. Bored with myself. So scary bored with myself. More and more everyday. And I wonder if Jacqueline ever felt this way. I'm a little uninspired. It happens to the best of us. I know I shouldn't take it hard. But I'm so afraid this time I'll never change. Won't shake it off I'll just go insane. More and more everyday. And I wonder if Loretta Lynn ever felt this way. I'm so bored with myself. So very bored with myself. So bored with myself.

it don't get better,"Woke up this morning with my head so heavy.... Thought about leaving on the next train comin'. Sometimes it gets so easy running from town to town. But changing beds won't change this feeling that I'm gonna drown. Too many hearts are broken-- we're never asked why. Too many sunsets are just passing us by. Come over here now don't be shy. Do you want to be happy or you want to be right?. It don't get much better than this. There's nowhere left to run to. No use worryin' about what you missed. Cause here it is baby it don't get better than this. We talk and talk and never know what it means. It really doesn't matter 'cause nothin's ever what is seems. All I ever wanted is here with you. But sometimes, baby, I get wrapped up and confused. So lets go on down to the edge of the sand. Take some time and take my hand. So much here we don't understand. So kiss me like the world is gonna end!. It don't get much better than this. There's nowhere left to run to. No use worryin' about what you missed. Cause here it is baby: It don't get better than this. Oh, better than this. Come on. Come on take my hand. It don't get much better than this. There's nowhere left to run to. No use worryin' about what you missed. Yeah here it is baby: it don't get better than this. Oh Oh Oh (various chorus shouts until end)."

And the games that she plays. You're a fool. If you go with her tonight. She'll make everything seem so right. [Chorus:]. Jessica, she'll never be the one you waited for. She'll only tell you lies and lead you o-on. Oh Jessica. You've never met a girl like this before. You'll never find a place where you belong. Oh Jessica. Take it from me. A woman knows. What a woman can do. To a man's lonely heart. It's the start and the end. If you don't stay away from Jessica. And the games that she plays. You're a fool. If you go with her tonight. She'll make everything seem so right. [Repeat chorus...]. ."
lay down (candles in the rain),"Lay down lay down. Lay it all down. Let your white birds smile up. At the ones who stand and frown. Lay down lay down. Lay it all down. Let your white birds smile up. At the ones who stand and frown. We were so close there was no room. We bled inside each others' wounds. We all had caught the same disease. And we all sang the songs of peace. Chorus:. Lay down lay down. Lay it all down. Let your white birds smile up. At the ones who stand and frown. Lay down lay down. Lay it all down. Let your white birds smile up. At the ones who stand and frown. What if I told you were stupid, destructive, soulless. Callous, murderous, malignant, belligerent, ignorant. Would you believe me would you like that. Or would you prove me wrong and fight back. I'd like to take the sunshine right from the sky. And let it shine on you through my eyes. You see we all in the same boat trying to float. So everybody grab a oar we can make it to shore. Chorus. We were so close there was no room. We bled inside each others' wounds. We all had caught the same disease. And we all sang the songs of peace. Some came to sing. Some came to pray. Some came to keep the dark away. So raise the candles high. 'Cause if you don't we could stay. Black against the night. So raise them higher again. And if you do we could stay dry against the rain. Chorus (repeat)."

Don't want to tear our love apart, I want to give my heart. Can't we start living here, giving. [Chorus]. So we are in love, so we are at war. But we can be on the same side. [repeat chorus]."
little slice,"In the decline of the civilization. I live in Hollywood. In this situation I'm in. Sometimes I wanna run away. I'm living on caffine. Stressing information. I turn to people who sing. For some inspiration. As the pressures mount each day. So my gay friend Larry. Took me off to Maui. Walk in the sunshine. Have a little chill-time. Silver rains came pouring down. Sitting at the ocean. See that it is tough. No matter what you have. It never seems enough. To let fate replace the doubt. Chorus:. We' all want. A little slice of heaven. To find our place in the sun. And I' want. A little slice of heaven. To find my place in the sun. Last May I decided. I wanna have a baby. Running against the clock. And a man, he says 'maybe?. As the window starts to close. A house in the country. A little piece of myself. Money in the bank. And a chance to take time. To breathe, just breathe slow. Chorus. Thought I met a broken man. When he said. I had it all, I lost it all!. But I wouldn't ever change a single thing. Cuz now I know how to go on ?. And on and on!?. Of my list of things. That change everyday. One thing's for sure. I'm safe to say;"

my little town,"We lock the doors at night. All the sirens scream. I don't drive my car. Insurance is too high. I live here in the city. My hometown's far away. I workout with concrete. I don't drive my car. The stars come out at night. You see them on the strip. Everybody arms themselves. There's no other place like this. I'll never leave this. Small town girl behind. The place where I come from. Is with me all the time. Oh, you could walk the streets. When the sun goes down. In my little town. You don't need defenses. When the sun goes down. In my little town. Back home on the street. After 10 at night. Mrs. Avery walks her dog. Checks to see what's going on. She doesn't lock the door. She lives here in good health. You don't hear the horn. When Mrs. Avery walks her dog. All I ever wanted. Was a view of city lights. Break away from here. Leave behind the quiet nights. Spend half your life. Trying to make a change. Then the other half. Trying to get back again. Oh, you could walk the streets. When the sun goes down. In my little town. You don't need defenses. When the sun goes down. In my little town. Look down the road. Look at the highway. Look past the fences. Look at the faces. What do you have on the other side?. Oh, you could walk the streets. When the sun goes down. In my little town. You don't need defenses. When the sun goes down. In my my town. You could walk the streets. When the sun goes down. In my little town. You don't need defenses. In my little town where I come from. In my little town you don't need a gun. In my little town where I come from. In my little town."
nobody's home,"She can talk for hours. words don't cover the scars.. She thinks she's crazy,. but they've just pushed her too far.. She runs to the mirror. Only savior she's known. Another slap on her face. Cause nobody's home.. Mother's always working. Slinging beer on the side.. Her dad's watching TV. And he's still getting high.. She knows he'll be waiting. Tryinto get her alone.. She hangs out on the corner. Cause nobody's home.. All she ever wanted. was a place on this earth. She shouts for a savior. For anyone to hear her. All she ever needed. Was hope in a world. In a world where she feels all alone. cause nobody's home. She cries for attention. Hanging on by a thread.. She can't stop the screaming. going on in her head.. Tears on the pillow. These are things she won't miss. Nothing to believe in. So it comes down to this.. Blood on the mirror,. Temptation is bliss.. Pills on the table,. She just couldn't resist..

out in the fields,"Empty streets like winter cold, feelings cut without a trace. Hands reach out ready to fold, another tear falls into place. Running through a quiet fire, I can see the flames grow wild. I hear a crimson word, inside, I am free. [Chorus:]. Out in the fields, the sky is burning. I feel the joy returning, out in the fields. Listen to the winds of heaven, I feel with a rhyme and reason. Scattered pictures like my thoughts. Shattered glass watch where I walk. Unspoken words tear me apart, another hole right through my heart. Looking through an open window, touching all around me. I see a silver rose, outside, I am free. [Chorus (repeat)]."
pain,"Holding us together. Then we're tearing us apart. It's tragic then it's beautiful. We shine and then it's dark. Feeling like a little kid. Because I can't let go. Chorus. Every time I think about. The things that I can't live without. Well I must love the pain. Misunderstood and complicated. Happiness is overrated. I must love the pain. Everytime you draw me in. I take a step away. Maybe I'm just restless. 'Cause I want. What I can't take. Itâ€™s a shame that nothing else on earth. Can make me feel this way. Chorus. Feelinâ€™ like a little kid because I canâ€™t let go. Chorus. Well, I must love the pain. I do love the pain."
perfect view,"Sitting in your car, it's the edge of the night. You turn to me baby, and I say that it's alright. You stare at the moon, then the music starts. The radio plays a song, for broken hearts. Your eyes turn a deep shade of blue. You can try but you can't hide the truth. I'm on the outside looking right into you. It's a perfect view, and they say.... [Chorus:]. Na Na Na Na Na Na. Standing next to you. Na Na Na Na Na Na. It's a perfect view. Na Na Na Na Na Na. Looking straight through you. Na Na Na Na Na Na. It's a perfect view. I want to walk away, but I just can't go. 'Cause I've got this fear, can't let it show. I'm a man alone don't get too near. Are those the words you mean for me to hear?.

No one's ever gonna catch you stumbling. That's where you shine. Remember when you told me. To get up and dust yourself off. It wasn't easy. Everything can change. And it usually does. It does. You said. Shake it off like it ain't no big thing. Wonâ€™t be the last time we're sinking. Oh, I know some things about you. You don't know. Chorus. That's where you shine.

sin city,In this town of pain. You could be the lucky one. Fate turns on a dime. The only thing that will change. Are the lights when they get brighter. They replace the sun. Out the door you get burned. And there is no way back in. You got nothing snake eyes. The house always wins. A drowning man does not die silently. You can feel the final warning. And the black money follows. Through the veins of the shallow. Change the name to protect the guilty. You’ll never leave Sin City. Where you are the King. In this room of shame. You could sink this town. And breathe another day. The mirror faces you. You cannot look away. Blood is on your hand. The streets will be the same. Under your feet like quicksand. Touch the face. Where a kiss of hope can last.

Look at the time I guess it went to waste. But I'm good to go I gotta toe the line. I'll make mistakes but I still got a chance. I'm gonna take. Everything you said. Is like a kick in the head. Don't count me out just yet. Place your money here instead. Chorus. Can't even tell me that you want me. But this time it's just all right. Something that you'll face in the morning. But baby if you want when I close this door. I'll leave on the light. Chorus.
wash my hands,"Washed my hands of crimes. Pour the water over my skin, my spine. Cleans my soul and ease my mind. I've been fixed all the damage done. Why do I always forget how far I've come?. I'm done dying for the past. I'm done dying for the past. Sins all forgiven now. Let's call it even shall we. Can't you judge me for my love. And not mistakes I've made. I swear by who I am and not by yesterday. I'm done dying for the past. I'm done dying for the last time. The last time, the last time, the last time. In between black and white I disappear. Circled around the stone until I landed here. I'm done dying for the past. I'm done dying for the past. I'm done dying. I'm done for the last time."
watched you fall,"You were my wild companion. we were forever high high high. we burned the night around us. sleeping could wait until we die. You were the scars of passion. and since the crashing came. You've broken every promise. I walked away. I watched you fall. I was blind to ya. was lying to ya. like everyone else who watched you fall. say they love you but they're laughing when you crawl. It's such a weary feeling. When you've been stealing from yourself. wishing the world away. blaming someone else. no one can do this for you. straighten you hair. fix your face. Take all the pain inside you wash it away. I watched you fall. I was blind to ya. was lying to ya. like everybody else who watched you fall. say they love you but they're laughing when you crawl. Did I hear you?. Did I try?. Can I forgive myself for not standing by?. I watched you fall. I was blind to ya. was lying to ya. like everybody else who watched you fall. say they love you but they're laughing, laughin' when you crawl. I was blind to ya. was lying to you. said I love you but I'm laughing. when you crawl. was blind to ya. you fall. I watched you fall. I watched you."
we never met,"He appears in a dream I can't forget. Though we never met, no we never met. I wake up with my eyes all soaking wet (crying). 'Cause we never met, no we never met. Over and over, night after night he's there. Under the covers, he answers my lover's prayer. In a dream I can't forget. Though we never met, no we never met. I am left with the lonely same regret. That we never met, no we never met. Come to me baby, out of the midnight skies. Wishing and hoping, he will materialize. I'm searching in my dreams, tearing at the seams. What's it take to make this dream come true. He appears in a dream I can't forget. Though we never met, no we never met. I wake up with my eyes all soaking wet (crying). 'Cause we never met, no we never met."
what would happen,"Electricity. eye to eye. Hey do I know you?. I can't speak. Stripped my senses. on the spot. I've never been defenseless. I can't even make sense of this. You speak and I don't hear a word. What would happen if we kissed?. Would your tongue slip past my lips?. Would you run away?. Would you stay?. Or would I melt into you?. Mouth to mouth. lust to lust. Spontaneously combust. Room is spinning. out of control. You act like you didn't notice. brushed my hand. Forbidden fruit. ring on my finger. Your such a moral, moral man. Would you throw it away?-- A question. Will I pretend I'm innocent?. What would happen if we kissed?. Would your tongue slip past my lips?. Would you run away?. Would you stay?. Or would I melt into you?. Mouth to mouth. lust to lust. Spontaneously combust.... What would happen if we kissed?. Ah.... I struggle with myself again. Quickly the walls are crumblin'. Don't know if I can turn away. What would happen if we kissed?. Would your tongue slip past my lips?. Would you run away?. Would you stay?. Or would I melt into you?. Mouth to mouth. If we kissed.... Would your tongue slip past my lips?. Would you run away?. Would you stay?. Or would I melt into you?. Mouth to mouth. If we kissed......oooooooo ahhhhh. If we kissed......oooooooo ohhhhh. ooooo ahhhh (etc-- fade out)"
when the sun goes down,"When the sun goes down, when the night star falls. I can see you come, I can hear you call. In every corner of the world, in every boy and every girl. There lives a hunger to be free. With every passion that I feel, and every secret I reveal. Oh let the night unchain my heart. Into the darkness now we go, every heart will find its soul [repeat]. When the sun goes down, when the night star falls. I can see you come, I can hear you call. Come meet me underneath the stars, and you can show me who you are. Shadows of love under the moon. Into the darkness now we go, every heart will find its soul [repeat]. When the sun goes down, when the city sleeps. We can be ourselves, in this land of dreams [repeat...]. When the sun goes down."
where lovers meet,"Today I write in my book. Dear God I need a change. I can't keep hiding. Wishing the mirror was lying. Show me where do I look. I know there must be a plan. Though I can't see one. I go through the motions anyway. Here I go again. Walking down a road I've never known. Chorus. I want to go where lovers meet. I want to breathe the air they breathe. I want to touch the dreams they dream. When I find someone to love. I want to go where lovers. Where lovers meet. I know my faith is blind. I'll take my chances. I'm tired of just surviving. I 'm not wasting any time. Just like tears in the rain. No one can see. Inside my heart is crying. Telling me I can't lie any more. Here I go again. Walking down a road I've never known. Chorus. I want to go where lovers meet. I want to breathe the air they breathe. I want to touch the dreams they dream. When I find someone to love. I want to go where lovers meet. Feel the wind beneath my feet. Oh, I want to feel that complete. When I find someone. . I spent half my life. Wasting my time. I don't want to hear my heart beating alone. Ohâ€¦. Chorus. I want to go. I want to go where lovers meet."
who's fooling who,"You're so bad. You look so good. Charisma of a playboy. Who made it big in Hollywood. The money so fine. You're livin' high. The women, wine. Fly to the parties. But you won't be caught. Unless you bring a crowd. All the friends you bought. Cuz you wanna be sure. Your smile is seen. And your lookins good. [Chorus:]. I know I have become much stronger now these days. I don't need that kind of love. I'm on my way. Who-who's fooling who. No matter what you think or do. Oh, I can see right through. So who's fooling who. You don't even listen to me. When I SHOUT. Being at the top. Is all that you're concerned about. But someday baby. You're gonna be meeting me again. Got two faces for every move. You've done it for so long. They all look good on you. But it's too late baby. You looked in the mirror too long again. [Repeat chorus]."
you don't know me,"I was wrong this was my mistake. I resolve to save what's mine again. I've always wanted to believe in things. And I pity you for taking that from me. You tried to erase the guilt that's on your face. But youâ€™re just hiding out behind your cool. Like a hurricane you changed. And because you took the blame. You thought that would be enough. And then Iâ€™d be on my way. Chorus. Did you think that I would let you forget me?. Did you think that I would just lie on the floor?. As you walked into you future did you think I. would give you control?. Well, you don't know me. Did you think that I would simply forgive you?. Maybe you think I'd just lay down and die. As you walked away, didn't you think I'd survive?. Well, you don't know me. My world changed like a thought replaced. I was faithful to the promises you made. When you say my name. Will it sound the same. As when you used to talk to me so cool ?. You want me to pretend. So you'll have your happy end. To wash away your guilt. And make it easier for you - oh. Chorus."
you're gonna miss my loving,You told me what I wanted to hear. So I fell in love with you. I believed that you were sincere. Now you've got me where you wanted me. Soon I'm gonna make you see. You're gonna miss my loving when it's gone. You're gonna miss my loving when it's gone. Had to keep a distance apart. But you swept me off my feet. Now you think you've won my heart. So you're taking me for granted now. Soon I'll turn the tables around. [Chorus:]. You're gonna miss my loving when it's gone. (You'll come crying to me). You're gonna miss my loving when it's gone. Now you may feel secure. And you're as you please. But soon you'll be begging on your knees. [Repeat chorus]. .
your attention,"Baby, what is wrong with you. Can't you see I want you around. And baby.... I'm not cryin'. I'm just dyin' for some touch. [Chorus:]. And if you don't give me your attention. I'll get attention from somebody else. I don't know what your intentions are. I have no patience to be put on the shelf. Mmm baby. You say you love me. Then you don't even know if I'm around. And baby. If you're not lying. Then keep trying or I'll be gone. [Chorus]. Baby, if you show me now. There may still be time. To change my heart. But baby. If you don't need me. You'll both leave me. When your cryin' starts. [Repeat chorus]. ."
your name,You're everywhere I walk. I don't remember if I smiled. I don't think we talked. But you always hung around a while. And I don't know your name. Yeah I think that you were tall. I don't remember if I was ever nice to you at all. Chorus. Suddenly you come undone. You tell me I'm the only one. You hold my head up with a gun. And tell me that we are in love. You touch me and you want the same. I close my eyes and start to pray. And tell you I will be the way. You want if you will only say your name. . You wrote me everyday. I never knew that it was you. I just threw it all away. I didn't know what else to do. Jesus told you to find me. And never ever let me go. And we would be so happy. He promised you that I would know. Chorus. I am sorry - so sorry oh. I am sorry Jesus forgot to tell me. I see that you are crying. I know you only meant to be with me. Maybe I was hasty. I should have listened more carefully. Please tell me itâ€™s not too late. Your decision has been made. Before you pull the trigger. Please won't you tell me your name?. Chorus.
