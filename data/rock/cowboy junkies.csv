sweet jane,"Anyone who's ever had a heart. Wouldn't turn around and break it. Anyone who's ever played a part. Wouldn't turn around and break it. Sweet Jane -2x. Ah, sweet, sweet Jane. Waited for Jimmy down in the alley. Waited there for him to come back home. Waited down on the corner. Thinking of ways to get back home. Sweet Jane -2x. Ah, sweet, sweet Jane. Anyone who's ever had a dream. Anyone who's ever played a part. Anyone who's ever been lonely. Anyone who's ever split apart. Sweet Jane -2x. Ah, sweet, sweet Jane. Heavenly blue-eyed roses. Seem to whisper to me. When you smile. Heavenly blue-eyed roses. Seem to whisper to me. When you smile. La, la, la, la.... Sweet Jane."
baby please don't go,"Now, baby, please don't go. Now, baby, please don't go. Now, baby, please don't go back to New Orleans. You know I love you so, you know I love you so. You got me waiting here. You got me waiting here. Before a .... Baby, please don't go. Baby, please don't go. Don't you call my name. Don't you call my name. Well you got me way down here. On a ball and chain. Oh, baby, please don't go. Oh, baby, please don't go. Now, baby, please don't go. Now, baby, please don't go. Now, baby, please don't go back to New Orleans. You know I love you so, you know I love you so. ...no, don't go."
a horse in the country,"(Michael Timmins). The money would be pretty good. if a quart of milk were still a dollar. or even if a quart of milk were still a quart. And the hours, well, I don't mind. how they creep on by like an old love of mine. it's the years that simply disappear that are doing me in. Guess I married too young,. yeah, nineteen was just too young,. but sometimes you meet someone. and your guts just burn. It's not that I don't love him anymore. it's just that when I hear him. coming through that front door. my heart doesn't race like it did once before. But I've got a horse out in the country. I get to see him every second Sunday. He comes when I call him,. yeah, he knows his name. One day I'll saddle up. and the two of us will ride away. This weather I could almost stand. if the sun would shine a little brighter. or even if the sun would shine at all. But lately it just seems to me. that this life has lost its mystery. and these cold fall mornings seem to bite. just a little bit harder. And all my friends have settled down. become their mothers and their fathers. without a sound. Except for Cathy,. she bought a one-way subway ticket. and left us all behind. But I've got a horse out in the country. I get to see him every second Sunday. He comes when I call him,. yeah, he knows his name. One day I'll saddle up. and the two of us will ride away. This town wouldn't be so bad. if a girl could trust her instincts. or even if a girl could trust a boy."
he will call you baby,"He will call you baby. but will he listen when you cry?. He will call you sweetheart. but always seem apart.. He will tear all your fences down,. trample all into the ground.. He will call you baby.. She will call you honey. and leave you twisting in the wind.. She will call you darling,. keep you stunned and wondering.. She will take you to another world. where the winds of confusion swirl.. She will call you honey.. We should call them lucky. as they watch their babies dance.. Or maybe call them crazy. for even thinking they have a chance.. They will carry her as far as they can. then abandon her once again,. they will call her baby.. They will call her baby"
brand new world,"Mouths to feed, shoes to buy. Rent to pay, tears to dry. Brand new world. I can't relate. Let us choose. To not participate. Open up. Let me wander in. Your heart is not. Such a tender thing. Brand new world. I contend. Only love. Will stop the withering. Oh, to lie in wait. As the shadows and the shapes. Spill across the walls. Like a river. Deep. In spate. Four am. Dark reality. Brand new world. And my heart. Is missing"
anniversary song,"Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful. as that of the rain-soaked purple. of the white birch in spring?. Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful. than on a warm fall night. under a Mackerel sky,. the smell of grapes on the wind?. Well I have known all these things. and the joys that they can bring. And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee. and to wear your ring. Have you ever had the pleasure of watching. a quiet winter's snow slowly gathering. like simple moments adding up?. Have you ever satisfied a gut feeling. to follow a dry dirt road that's beckoning you. to the heart of a shimmering summer's day?. Well I have known all these things. and the joys that they can bring. And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee. and to wear your ring. And I don't know how I survived those days. before I held your hand. Well I never thought that I would be the one. to admit that the moon and the sun. shine so much more brighter when. seen through two pairs of eyes than. when seen through just one. Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful. as a face in a crowd of people. that lights up just for you?. Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful. as when you wake. by the side of that boy or girl. who has pledged their love to you?. Well I have known all these things. and the joys that they can bring. And now every morning there's a cup of coffee. and I wear your ring."
200 more miles,"Atlanta's a distant memory. Montgomery a recent birth. and Tulsa burns on the desert floor. like a signal fire. I got Willie on the radio. a dozen things on my mind. and number one is fleshing out. these dreams of mine. I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line. before I sleep. But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms. to fall into tonight. In Nashville there is a lighter. in a case for all to see. it speaks of dreams and heartaches. left unsung. And in the corner stands a guitar and. lonesome words scrawled in a drunken hand. I don't travel past, travel hard before. and I'm beginning to understand. That I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line. before I sleep. But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms. to fall into tonight. They say that I am crazy. my life wasting on this road. that time will find my dreams. scared or dead and cold. But I heard there is a light. drawing me to reach an end. and when I reach there, I'll turn back. and you and I can begin again. I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line. before I sleep. But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms. to fall into tonight. I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line. before I sleep. But I wouldn't trade all your golden tomorrows. for one hour of this night. Atlanta's a distant memory. Montgomery a recent birth. and Tulsa burns on the desert floor. like a signal fire."
i'm so lonesome i could cry,Hear the lonesome whippoorwill. His song's too blue to fly. The midnight train is a-winding low. I'm so lonesome I could cry. I've never seen a night so long. When time keeps crawling by. The moon is gone behind the clouds. To hide his face and cry. Have you ever seen a robin weep. When leaves have turned to brown?. Like me he's lost his will to live. I'm so lonesome I could cry. The silence of a falling star. Lights up a purple haze. and as I wonder where you are. I'm so lonesome I could cry.
license to kill,"Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth. He can do with it as he please. And if things don't change soon, he will. Oh, man has invented his doom. First step was touching the moon. Now there's a woman on my block. She just sit there as the night grow still. She say who gonna take away his license to kill. Now, they take him and they teach him. And they groom him for life. And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill. Then they bury him with stars. Sell his body like they do used cars. Now there's a woman on my block. She just sit there facin' the hill. She say who gonna take away his license to kill. Now, he's hell bent for destruction. He's afraid and confused. And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill. All he believes are his eyes. And his eyes they just tell him lies. But there's a woman on my block. Sitting there in a cold chill. She say who gonna take away his license to kill. May be noisemaker, spirit maker. Heartbreaker, backbreaker. Leave no stone unturned. May be an actor in a plot. That might be all that you got. Till your error you clearly learn. Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool. And when he sees his reflection he's fulfilled. Oh, man is opposed to fair play. He wants it all and he wants it his way. Now, there's a woman on my block. She just sit there as the night grow still. She say who gonna take away his license to kill. (instrumental verse)"
close my eyes,"I want to walk away. like Judas from the table.. Turn my back. and walk away.. I want to close my eyes. like that novice at the altar.. Bow my head. and close my eyes.. Sorrow took Love's splintered hands. and waltzed her 'cross a painted floor.. Whispered softly in her ear,. ""let's get outta here"".. I'm going to breathe the air. that my children will be breathing.. Breathe them out. and breathe them in again.. I'm going to close my eyes. And walk away.. Turn my back. bow my head. and close my eyes."
come calling (his song),"The stillness here,. like what he sometimes finds inside her,. hits so hard it can steal your breath forever.. He sometimes wonders. is the sum of their lives together. him on the floor and her lost to a mind in tatters.. These days he's drinking for the pleasure of falling. and he's falling for the pleasure of pretending. that she's sitting by the window waiting. for him to come calling.. If I could fix me up a week of twilight hours. we'd sit on the point. and watch the sun continually flounder.. Bathed in gold we'd plug into some kind of power. and connect with those days. back before all of this went sour.. 'Cause I'm drinking for the pleasure of falling. and I'm falling for the pleasure of pretending. that you're sitting by the window waiting. for me to come calling.. Odd how the darkness always makes us whisper. and with the last of the sun. you can feel the approach of the winter.. Now is the time of each day that I. desperately miss her.. I suppose I will learn how to live my life without her.. So you're drinking for the pleasure of falling. and you're falling for the pleasure of pretending. that I'm sitting by the window waiting. for you to come calling."
i don't get it,"Breaking away to the other side. I wanna make sense of why we live and die. I don't get it, I don't get it. I ask my friends if they understand. They just laugh at me and watch another band. They don't worry, they don't worry. Lookin' for a way to lose my load. I wanna make it easy to walk this road. I can't find it, yeah I can't find it. Yeah, I'm looking for answers in so many places. I open my mind. I don't get it. Walkin' this earth and keepin' my peace. I do what I want but the price is steep. It don't seem right, it don't seem right. My mama she told me ""One step at a time. and sooner or later you'll walk that line"". I don't want to, I don't want to. Takin' my time to live and die. I wanna find a way to do it right. and I ease on, and I ease on. They say ""One thing always leads to another"". I open my mind. I don't get it. Breaking away to the other side. I wanna make sense of why we live and die. I don't get it, I don't get it. I don't get it, I don't get it. I don't get it."
mariner's song,"The last of man's great unchained beasts. Lies lapping at my door. The last of man's great unchained beasts. Lies lapping at my door. And I'd be happy to give it what it wants. But I do know it would just ask for more. CHORUS. I search for you in every crest I ride. In every trough I travel through. I search for you in every trough I travel through. I didn't mean to leave you. I unfurled my sail and the wind did blow. I didn't mean to leave you darlin'. I unfurled my sail and the wind did blow. Why why why why oh why, I did not drop my anchor. Oh Lord I will never know. CHORUS. On the lee of the island I hear your voice. Deep inside the calm. On the lee of the island I hear your voice. Deep inside the calm. Whispering baby, I'll be your delight. If you promise to be my red sky tonight. CHORUS. In the storm you are my destination. In the port you are my storm. In the storm you are my destination. In the port you are storm. But I would weather you my love. If you would be my guide. If you would be my stars in the skies above. CHORUS. CHORUS."
those final feet,"Place my body on the funeral pyre,. cut it loose to float downstream. Leave it frozen on a mountain top,. suspend it high to be picked clean. You said never to grow old,. but you forgot to tell me how. You said never to grow old. and then you sank your teeth into those final feet. Last night I dreamt of owls at my window. I knew that time was winding down. Turned to tell you of my premonition,. changed my mind and lay back down. You said never to grow old,. but you forgot to tell me how. You said never to grow old. and then you sank your teeth into those final feet. No sense wasting the time you got,. you got to walk down every road. No sense pretending that you're what you're not,. when you got to shoulder every load. You said never to grow old,. but you forgot to tell me how. You said never to grow old. and then you sank your teeth into those final feet. Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose. You said never to grow old,. but you forgot to tell me how. You said never to grow old. and then you sank your teeth into those final feet."
rock and bird,She captured both rock and bird. Tied one to the leg of the other. Kept them as prisoner. Till they knew who was master. Then she threw them to the sky. Bird with unbarred wings disappeared. Rock with weighted heart returned. And rock became her anchor. And bird became her dream. And now she stands on the forest floor. Among the pines and towering firs. Rock still firm beneath her feet. Bird perched high above her. Singing songs of love's betrayal. I offered you my endless skies. You countered with hoods and chains. This song I sing will be the last. To be inspired by your memory.
five room love story,"I met her in a church on a Sunday evening. not late on Saturday night. She sang Ave Maria. a little flat and out of time. but that's what drew me to her. so that's alright. As she placed a nickle in the basket. that I held before her. I asked her to be my wife. And there's one cardboard heart. for every time you said ""I love you"". A painted star for every secret that we shared. A dried lima bean and small plastic birds. because you cared. I hear their talk and I watch them swap. their old black and whites. Bitter and beaten. they talk of life's cheatin'. like old boxers comparing scars. All I remember is a smile at the top of every working morning. and a shoulder always willing and able. and all those nights that we'd spend just sitting. and talking around our kitchen table. And there's one cardboard heart. for every time you said ""I love you"". A painted star for every secret that we shared. A dried lima bean and small plastic birds. because you cared. Five rooms made stronger by the breaking and the healing. of the two hearts they protected within. Now one heart left aching. just piecing and painting. these walls with the memories of all that is real. And there's one cardboard heart. for every time you said ""I love you"". A painted star for every secret that we shared. A dried lima bean and small plastic birds. because you cared. And there's one cardboard heart. for every time you said ""I love you"". A painted star for every secret that we shared. A dried lima bean and small plastic birds. because you cared."
something more besides you,"One foot strands before the crib. the other by the casket. A question formed upon stilled lips. is passed on but never asked. I guess I believe that there's a point. to what we do. But I ask myself is there. something more besides you?. Two are born to cross. their paths, their lives, their hearts. If by chance one turns away. are they forever lost?. I guess I believe that there's a point. to what we do. But I ask myself is there. something more besides you?. This morning I awoke,. the bed warm where it once was cold. Small blessings laid upon us. Small mysteries slowly unfold. Yet I still wonder is there a point. to what we do?. 'Cause I kind of doubt. that there is something more besides you. Although it's hard to find the point. to what we do,. do I dare believe that there is. something more besides you?."
take me,". . where the thunder meets the light. Take me in your gentle arms. and I'll love you through the night. Come on and take me, take me, take me. Come on and take me, take me, take me.

a few simple words,"[Previously unreleased song . Lay It Down outtake]. Transcribed by T.V.Roosmalen. What does he see in those mashed potatoes?. what secrets does he hold that can be so grin?. the silence like a canyon dividing them. he's on one side she's opposite him. trying so desperately to get his attention. she says, ""honey, you're a bastard of great proportion"".. he says, ""darling, I plead guilty to that sin."". with potatoes half way to his mouth. he looks her in the eye and says,. ""without a doubt. my love for you is all that I believe in.. ""With those few simple words. her heart is sent soaring. she's able to face another day. through the anger and the laughter. she knows that she matters. and somebody out there cares.. What does she gain by all this sulking?. what trouble can there be for one so young?. dark tension building like the clouds of a storm. her daughter's in her room and she's at the door. trying to figure what all this fuss is for.. she says, ""mother, you're a witch. and I'll always hate you."". she says, ""daughter, perhaps these words. you speak are true."". she quietly moves towards the bed,. look her in the eye gently says,. ""but I will always believe in you."". With those few simple words. her heart is sent soaring. she's able to face another day.. through the anger and the laughter. she knows that she matters. and somebody out there cares.. what do we need to keep us going?. what do we need at the end of the day?. mysteries keep piling like dirty clothes. in the corner.. you never thought you'd give up.. but you're beginning to wonder. when through the gloom you hear. a familiar voice say..... .... a few simple words. that send your heart soaring. you're able to face another day.. through the anger and the laughter. you know that you matter. and somebody out there cares.."
where are you tonight?,"There's a young man in the corner playing 'Crazy' all night long. quarters piled high upon the table. He orders Wild Turkey and with a quick wit and a smile. he says, 'My darling, you're the one I'll drape in sable'. But his baseball cap and this bar-room rap. tell me a different story. that this is not my prince to grant all my wishes. Just another lonely country-boy grown weary of the night. Just another boy with a sink full of dirty dishes. Where are you tonight?. When I left you in my dreams last night. you promised me that we would be breaking free. Where are you tonight?. He tells me of the back roads. and how we'll drive them all night long. how the days will fade and the moon will hang forever. and how the cloud of dust we'll kick up will linger like a song. and the myth will grow about the two who refused to surrender. Then I catch us in the bar-room mirror. with his arm around my shoulder. this girl I see has grown so unfamiliar. and as she stands to leave with a stranger by her side. she can't help but laugh at a life grown so peculiar. Where are you tonight?. I don't think I can face tomorrow's light. not knowing if you'll be there to guide me. Where are you tonight?. Where are you tonight?. I think that I'll make it through all right,. but I'd love to have you just one more time beside me."
black eyed man,"(Michael Timmins). Black eyed man he took the blame. for the poisoning of the well. They found this shoes by the pulley. They found his fingerprints all over the pail. Black eyed man I'm warning you. the people around here. will not be fooled by a simple line or two. Yes your honour I do solemnly swear. that I saw him late last night,. dancing barefoot, bathed in light. and reaching for every star in sight. Yes I did go to him,. but completely against my will. and yes he did things to me. things of which I dream of still. Black eyed man I'm warning you. what I say is what you'll do. to hell with love and truth. I always meant to say I'm sorry. for all the things I said and did. 'Sorry,' I feel better now, do you?. But you promised me the sky. and fell short a star or two. What else did you expect me to do?. Black eyed man he took the blame. for the poisoning of the well. They found his shoes by the pulley. They found his fingerprints all over the pail. With a noose around his neck,. cicadas trilling everywhere,. he says to the people gathered round him,. 'it ain't the water that's not right around here'. Black eyed man I'm thirsty dear. be a love and bring some water here. drawn fresh from the well."
blue guitar,"I wish I had a blue guitar,. A blue guitar to play all night long.. Singing songs of loss and love.. Singing songs till morning comes.. Ghosts in the basement. Screams from the kitchen. I tell you folks I'm leaving.. Seems I can already hear the door slammin'.. I tell you folks I think I'm leavin'.. Goodbye to the highway. Goodbye to the sky. I'm headed out goodbye, goodbye.. Goodbye to the highway. Goodbye to the sky. I'm headed our goodbye, goodbye.. I wish I had a blue guitar,. A blue guitar to play all night long.. I wish I had a blue guitar,. A blue guitar to let you know somehow. You are not needed now.."
bea's song (river song trilogy part ii),"Speed River at my feet running low and flat. I'm sitting here burning daylight,. thinking about the past. and that distance out there. where the earth meets the sky. The slightest move and this river mud. pulls me further down. John's at my side, but he's sitting on firmer ground. John says I look at the moon and the stars. these days more often than I look into his eyes. and I can't disagree so I don't say nothing. I just stare on past his face at Venus rising,. like a shining speck of hope hanging over the horizon. With each passing year that I sit here. that horizon seems to inch just that much nearer. and all that appears on it seems as clear as spit. But if there's on thing in my life. that these years have taught. it's that you can always see it coming. but you can never stop it. Speed River at my feet running low and flat. I'm sitting here burning daylight,. thinking about the past. and that distance out there. where the earth meets the sky. The slightest move and this river mud. pulls me further down. John's at my side,. but he's not noticing that I'm drowning. The slightest move and this river mud. pulls me further down. John's at my side,. but he's not noticing that I'm drowning."
bad boy,"(Larry Williams). A bad little boy moved into the neighborhood. He won't do nothin' right just a-sittin' got to look so good. He don't wanna go to school and learn to read and write. Just sits around the house and plays that rock n' roll music all night. Well, he put thumbtacks on teacher's chair. put chewing gum in li'l girl's hair. Now Junior, behave yourself!. Buys every rock n' roll book on the magazine stand. Every dime that he gets, oh is off to the juke box man. Well, he worries his teacher till she's a-ready to poop. from rockin' and a rollin' spinnin' in a Hula-Hoop. Well, his rock n' roll has gotta stop. Junior's head is hard as rock. Now Junior, behave yourself!. Gonna tell your mama you'd better do what she said. Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head. You shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighboor's cat. You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat. Well, your mama said it's gotta stop. Junior's head is hard as rock. Now Junior, behave yourself!."
at the end of the rainbow,"Again,. At the end of the rainbow. Again,. No gold to be found. Just this cold unmade bed. The last 3 words you said. And this buzzing on the telephone line. Paris, well, there is fog on the Seine. Amsterdam still courses through my veins. All these dark crazy sights,. Wouldn't be so bad. If I could just taste your breath once again. Honey I saw your daddy. Lying by the roadside. His feet sticking out of a sack. Honey they'll be calling. To tell you that your daddy. Never will be coming back. Again. At the end of the rainbow. Again,. No words to be found. Just this voice sad and alone. Me wishing I was home. And the silence on the telephone line."
200 more miles,"Atlanta's a distant memory. Montgomery a recent birth. and Tulsa burns on the desert floor. like a signal fire. I got Willie on the radio. a dozen things on my mind. and number one is fleshing out. these dreams of mine. I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line. before I sleep. But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms. to fall into tonight. In Nashville there is a lighter. in a case for all to see. it speaks of dreams and heartaches. left unsung.

But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms. to fall into tonight. I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line. before I sleep. But I wouldn't trade all your golden tomorrows. for one hour of this night. Atlanta's a distant memory. Montgomery a recent birth. and Tulsa burns on the desert floor. like a signal fire."
a common disaster,"A candle burning for everything I've ever wanted. A tattoo burned for everything I've ever wanted and lost. I had a long list of names that I kept in my back pocket,. but I've cut it down to one and your name's at the top. Won't you share a common disaster?. Share with me a common disaster. A common disaster. I found myself a friend,. but he's crooked as a stick in water. So now I'm writing fairy tales. to catch the spirit of revenge. He's got a plan to steal my little sister,. but I'm not too concerned. 'cause I will get him in the end. Won't you share a common disaster?. Share with me a common disaster. A common disaster. Going to find me someone to share. A common disaster. Run away with me from a life so cramped and dull. Not worry too much about the happily-ever-after. Just keep the Caddy moving. 'til we're well beyond that hill. Won't you share a common disaster?. Share with me a common disaster. A common disaster."

With those few simple words. her heart is sent soaring. she's able to face another day.. through the anger and the laughter. she knows that she matters. and somebody out there cares.. what do we need to keep us going?. what do we need at the end of the day?. mysteries keep piling like dirty clothes. in the corner.. you never thought you'd give up.. but you're beginning to wonder. when through the gloom you hear. a familiar voice say..... .... a few simple words. that send your heart soaring. you're able to face another day.. through the anger and the laughter. you know that you matter. and somebody out there cares.."
a horse in the country,"(Michael Timmins). The money would be pretty good. if a quart of milk were still a dollar. or even if a quart of milk were still a quart. And the hours, well, I don't mind. how they creep on by like an old love of mine. it's the years that simply disappear that are doing me in. Guess I married too young,. yeah, nineteen was just too young,. but sometimes you meet someone. and your guts just burn. It's not that I don't love him anymore. it's just that when I hear him. coming through that front door. my heart doesn't race like it did once before. But I've got a horse out in the country. I get to see him every second Sunday. He comes when I call him,. yeah, he knows his name. One day I'll saddle up. and the two of us will ride away. This weather I could almost stand. if the sun would shine a little brighter. or even if the sun would shine at all. But lately it just seems to me. that this life has lost its mystery. and these cold fall mornings seem to bite. just a little bit harder. And all my friends have settled down. become their mothers and their fathers. without a sound. Except for Cathy,. she bought a one-way subway ticket. and left us all behind. But I've got a horse out in the country. I get to see him every second Sunday. He comes when I call him,. yeah, he knows his name. One day I'll saddle up. and the two of us will ride away. This town wouldn't be so bad. if a girl could trust her instincts. or even if a girl could trust a boy."
angel mine,He searched for those wings that he knew. that this angel should have at her back. And although he can't find them. he really don't mind. 'cause he knows they'll grow back. And he reached for that halo that he knows. that she had when she first caught his eye. Although his hand came back empty. he's really not worried. 'cause he knows it still shines. I can't promise that I'll grow those wings. or keep this tarnished halo shined. but I'll never betray your trust. angel mine. I search all the time on the ground. for our shadows cast side by side. Just to remind me that I haven't gone crazy. that you exist and are mine. And I know that your skin is as warm and as real. as that smile in your eyes. But I have to keep touching and smelling. and tasting for fear it's all lies. I can't promise that I'll grow those wings. or keep this tarnished halo shined. but I'll never betray your trust. angel mine. Last night I awoke from the deepest of sleeps. with your voice in my head. And I could tell by your breathing. that you were still sleeping. I repeated those words that you had said. I can't promise that I'll grow those wings. or keep this tarnished halo shined. but I'll never betray your trust. angel mine
anniversary song,"Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful. as that of the rain-soaked purple. of the white birch in spring?. Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful. than on a warm fall night. under a Mackerel sky,. the smell of grapes on the wind?. Well I have known all these things. and the joys that they can bring. And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee. and to wear your ring. Have you ever had the pleasure of watching. a quiet winter's snow slowly gathering. like simple moments adding up?. Have you ever satisfied a gut feeling. to follow a dry dirt road that's beckoning you. to the heart of a shimmering summer's day?. Well I have known all these things. and the joys that they can bring. And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee. and to wear your ring. And I don't know how I survived those days. before I held your hand. Well I never thought that I would be the one. to admit that the moon and the sun. shine so much more brighter when. seen through two pairs of eyes than. when seen through just one. Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful. as a face in a crowd of people. that lights up just for you?. Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful. as when you wake. by the side of that boy or girl. who has pledged their love to you?. Well I have known all these things. and the joys that they can bring. And now every morning there's a cup of coffee. and I wear your ring."
at the end of the rainbow,"Again,. At the end of the rainbow. Again,. No gold to be found. Just this cold unmade bed. The last 3 words you said. And this buzzing on the telephone line. Paris, well, there is fog on the Seine. Amsterdam still courses through my veins. All these dark crazy sights,. Wouldn't be so bad. If I could just taste your breath once again. Honey I saw your daddy. Lying by the roadside. His feet sticking out of a sack. Honey they'll be calling. To tell you that your daddy. Never will be coming back. Again. At the end of the rainbow. Again,. No words to be found. Just this voice sad and alone. Me wishing I was home. And the silence on the telephone line."

Now Junior, behave yourself!."
bea's song (river song trilogy part ii),"Speed River at my feet running low and flat. I'm sitting here burning daylight,. thinking about the past. and that distance out there. where the earth meets the sky. The slightest move and this river mud. pulls me further down. John's at my side, but he's sitting on firmer ground. John says I look at the moon and the stars. these days more often than I look into his eyes. and I can't disagree so I don't say nothing. I just stare on past his face at Venus rising,. like a shining speck of hope hanging over the horizon. With each passing year that I sit here. that horizon seems to inch just that much nearer. and all that appears on it seems as clear as spit. But if there's on thing in my life. that these years have taught. it's that you can always see it coming. but you can never stop it. Speed River at my feet running low and flat. I'm sitting here burning daylight,. thinking about the past. and that distance out there. where the earth meets the sky. The slightest move and this river mud. pulls me further down. John's at my side,. but he's not noticing that I'm drowning. The slightest move and this river mud. pulls me further down. John's at my side,. but he's not noticing that I'm drowning."
beneath the gate,"She was found beneath the gate,. forsaken at the gate.. Who would have thought that so much love. could be so carelessly misplaced.. Found. Beneath the gate.. We gazed upon the moon,. a honed and whetted moon.. Wondered if you saw the same. an hour from your mothers womb.. Gazing at the moon.. We stood beneath the gate.. Three beneath the gate.. The rare good will of the random world,. smiling like a sickle moon.. She was found beneath the gate.. Forsaken at the gate.. Found beneath the gate."

blue guitar,"I wish I had a blue guitar,. A blue guitar to play all night long.. Singing songs of loss and love.. Singing songs till morning comes.. Ghosts in the basement. Screams from the kitchen. I tell you folks I'm leaving.. Seems I can already hear the door slammin'.. I tell you folks I think I'm leavin'.. Goodbye to the highway. Goodbye to the sky. I'm headed out goodbye, goodbye..

blue moon revisited (a song for elvis),"I only want to say. That if there is a way. I want my baby back with me. 'cause he's my true love. my only one don't you see?. And on that fateful day. Perhaps in the new sun of May. My baby walks back into my arms. I'll keep him beside me. forever from harm. You see I was afraid. to let my baby stray. I kept him too tightly by my side. and then one sad day. he went away and he died. Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone. without a dream in my heart. without a love of my own. Blue Moon, you knew just what I was there for. You heard me saying a prayer for. someone I really could care for. I only want to say. That if there is a way. I want my baby back with me. 'cause he's my true love. my only one don't you see?."
blues eyed savior,"Where’d you go my blue eyed saviour?. Where’d you go my darling one?. Lying on that field of honour,. not sure what you’re waiting on.. And she won’t let him through the door.. Her mind is ticking through those tumbling years,. the one’s he promised he’d be there for.. She says, “hope: the belief that loved ones will never die”.. I’ve never heard such nonsense,. I’ve never heard such lies.. What to do with our sputtering engine?. What to do with our fading star?. Leaving us to wander freely,. trying to find out where we are.. And I can’t bear to see him go.. There is just too much left on the table.. There has been too much left alone.. She says, “hope: the belief that loved ones will never die”.. I’ve never heard such nonsense,. I’ve never heard such lies.. Listen to my wide eyed bundle.. Listen to them assail the night.. Lost again in their caves of wonder,. leaving us alone outside.. And I can barely stand the simple pleasure,. each breath carrying just a little more weight.. As I bend to adjust the comforter. I think, “hope: the belief that loved ones will never die”. I’ve never heard such nonsense,. I’ve never heard such lies."
brand new world,"Mouths to feed, shoes to buy. Rent to pay, tears to dry. Brand new world. I can't relate. Let us choose. To not participate. Open up. Let me wander in. Your heart is not. Such a tender thing. Brand new world. I contend. Only love. Will stop the withering. Oh, to lie in wait. As the shadows and the shapes. Spill across the walls. Like a river. Deep. In spate. Four am. Dark reality. Brand new world. And my heart. Is missing"
bread and wine,"Well I'm lyin' in my bed, a tangle of arms and legs,. but the one that I'm with is not the one bouncing 'round my head.. I could turn this into song or cheap fantasy,. but whatever I've ignited will still burn in me.. Bread and wine, bread and wine, your heart ain't nearly as guilty as mine.. I'm a dark heavy heart. I'm a soul full of holes.. I'm a boat that is sinking, muddy waters threatening this baggage in my hold.. And there's a line in my head from an old gospel song,. but no matter how hard I try, the words they just come out wrong.. Bread and wine, bread and wine your thoughts aint nearly as wicked as mine.. Bread and wine, bread and wine your cross aint nearly as heavy as mine.. I've been graced by the gift of a gold wedding band.. I've been soothed by the simple caress of my true love's hand.. And yet I'm lyin' in my bed, a tangle of arms and legs,. and the one that I'm with is not the one that I'm dreaming of.. Bread and wine, bread and wine, won't you please be my bread and wine.. Bread and wine, bread and wine, won't you please be my bread and wine."
brothers under the bridge,"Saigon, it was all gone. The same Coke machines as the streets I grew on. Down a mesquite canyon we come walking along the ridge. Me and the brothers under the bridge. Campsite's an hour's walk from the nearest road to town. Up here there's too much brush and canyon for the CHP choppers to touch down. Ain't lookin' for nothin', just wanna live. Me and the brothers under the bridge. Come the Santa Ana's, man, that dry brush'll light. Billy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night. We buried his body in the white stone high up along the ridge. Me and the brothers under the bridge. Had enough of town and the street life. Over nothing you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife. Now I don't want no trouble and I ain't got none to give. Me and the brothers under the bridge. I come home in '72. You were just a beautiful light in your mama's dark eyes of blue. I stood down on the tarmac, I was just a kid. Me and the brothers under the bridge. Come Veteran's Day I sat in the stands in my dress blues. I held your mother's hand when they passed with the red, white and blue. One minute you're right there . . then something slips . ."
'cause cheap is how i feel,"It's the kind of night that's so cold, when you spit. It freezes before it hits the ground. And when a bum asks for a quarter, you give a dollar. If he's out tonight, he must be truly down. And I'm searching all the windows for a last minute present. To prove to you what I said was real. For something small and frail and plastic baby. 'Cause cheap is how I feel. Half a moon in the sky tonight, bright enough. To come up with an answer. To the question, why is it that every time I see you. My love grows a little stronger. But your memory leaves my stomach churning. Feeling like a lie about to be revealed. But I'll horde all this to myself. 'Cause cheap is how I feel. It's not the smell in here that gets to me, it's the lights. How I hate the shadows that they cast. And the sound of clinking bottles is the one sure thing. I'll always drag with me from my past. I think I'll find a pair of eyes tonight, to fall into. And maybe strike a deal. Your body for my soul, fair swap. 'Cause cheap is how I feel."
close my eyes,"I want to walk away. like Judas from the table.. Turn my back. and walk away.. I want to close my eyes. like that novice at the altar.. Bow my head. and close my eyes.. Sorrow took Love's splintered hands. and waltzed her 'cross a painted floor.. Whispered softly in her ear,. ""let's get outta here"".. I'm going to breathe the air. that my children will be breathing.. Breathe them out. and breathe them in again.. I'm going to close my eyes. And walk away.. Turn my back. bow my head. and close my eyes."
cold tea blues,If I pour your cup. That is friendship. If I add your milk. That is manners. If I stop there. Claiming ignorance of taste. That is tea. But if I measure the sugar. To satisfy your expectant tounge. Then that is love. But if I measure the sugar. To satisfy your expectant tounge. Then that is love. Sitting untouched. And growing cold.
come calling (his song),"The stillness here,. like what he sometimes finds inside her,. hits so hard it can steal your breath forever.. He sometimes wonders. is the sum of their lives together. him on the floor and her lost to a mind in tatters.. These days he's drinking for the pleasure of falling. and he's falling for the pleasure of pretending. that she's sitting by the window waiting. for him to come calling.. If I could fix me up a week of twilight hours. we'd sit on the point. and watch the sun continually flounder.. Bathed in gold we'd plug into some kind of power. and connect with those days. back before all of this went sour.. 'Cause I'm drinking for the pleasure of falling. and I'm falling for the pleasure of pretending. that you're sitting by the window waiting. for me to come calling.. Odd how the darkness always makes us whisper. and with the last of the sun. you can feel the approach of the winter.. Now is the time of each day that I. desperately miss her.. I suppose I will learn how to live my life without her.. So you're drinking for the pleasure of falling. and you're falling for the pleasure of pretending. that I'm sitting by the window waiting. for you to come calling."
common disaster,"A candle burning for everything I've ever wanted. A tattoo burned for everything I've ever wanted and lost. I had a long list of names that I kept in my back pocket,. but I've cut it down to one and your name's at the top. Won't you share a common disaster?. Share with me a common disaster. A common disaster. I found myself a friend,. but he's crooked as a stick in water. So now I'm writing fairy tales. to catch the spirit of revenge. He's got a plan to steal my little sister,. but I'm not too concerned. 'cause I will get him in the end. Won't you share a common disaster?. Share with me a common disaster. A common disaster. Going to find me someone to share. A common disaster. Run away with me from a life so cramped and dull. Not worry too much about the happily-ever-after. Just keep the Caddy moving. 'til we're well beyond that hill. Won't you share a common disaster?. Share with me a common disaster. A common disaster"
cowboy junkies lament,"(Townes Van Zandt). Townes Van Zandt Music ASCAP. Baby hit the back door. breathin' real heavy. said the boys in the alley. wouldn't leave her alone. Mama did her make-up in a terrible hurry. she finally got ready. but the boys were gone.

Lily's just praying for the trial to be over. lady Rose just waiting for the axe to fall. Show me off on the way to town. the sky's still shiny. and the earth's still brown. Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases. gonna dance in their faces. when the guitar sounds. Won't be long. I won't be gone. Been leaning toward the shadows all along.

crescent moon,"Reach a hand to the crescent moon. Grab hold of the hollow. If she sits in the palm of the left. That moon will be fuller tomorrow. If she sits in the palm of the right. That moon is on the wane. And the love of the one who shares your bed. Will be doing just the same. CHORUS. Won't you come with me, she said. There's plenty of room in my iron bed. You're looking cold and tired. And more than a little human. I know I'm not part of the life you had planned. But I think once your body feels my hand. Your mind will change and your heart will lose its pain. Out among the fields gently hipped beneath the corn. Assiniboine bones beneath the highway. He stood there and he thought of home. A finger traces the path of a satellite. You're drawn to a distant copse of trees. A voice as smooth as mare's trail. Clings to a prairie breeze. CHORUS. Do I reach for you when I know you're on the wane. Do I sense you when I know you're not around. Do I search for you when I know you can't be found. Do I dare to speak your name. Raise your eyes to a moonless sky. And try to wish upon a rising star. Search all you want for her blessing. But you won't find her sparkling there. Now cast your eyes to a part of the sky. Where nothing but darkness unfolds. And watch as all around you she reveals. The brilliance of secrets untold. CHORUS. Do I reach for you when I know you're on the wane. Do I sense you when I know you're not around. Do I search for you when I know you can't be found. Do I dare to speak your name."

dark hole again,"Stuck in that dark hole again.. Someone throw me a ladder. on which I can depend.. Someone give me a handhold. to help me ascend.. Someone give me a reason. to start up these walls once again.. Lost in those gray clouds again.. Trying to punch my way through them. as fear settles in.. Earth growing larger as I fall into a spin.. Someone give me a reason. to take on those gray clouds again.. Caught in this rip tide again.. My mouth wide open,. the sea pouring in.. Perhaps I'll just float here. and see where this journey ends.. Until someone gives me a reason. to stay clear of those rip tides again."

dragging hooks (river song trilogy part 3),"Can't lose the taste of this river mud. Black water in my lungs. They say you can't step in the same river twice. Well I've been steppin' in this river.

dreaming my dreams with you,"I hope that I find what I'm reaching for. The way that it is in my mind. I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore. and maybe to have learned this time. Someday I'll get over you. I'll live to see it all through. But I'll always miss. Dreaming my dreams with you. But I won't let it change me, not if I can.

escape is so simple,"The way you kissed me this morning. It told me that you would soon be going. You didn't even look in my eye. When you said goodbye. And last night in your sleep you broke all the promises. That I knew you would not keep. Now I'm reading the letter that you placed on the dresser. And you're five hundred miles down the road. Escape is so simple. In a world where sunsets can be erased. But distance only loses the knife. The pattern of its scars. Can always be traced. Yeah, I remember when we said forever. Was the craziest word that we knew. But I think that I like it much better than I do goodbye. And I could sit here all evening and think of the reasons. Why you're not by my side. Instead I'll go to the kitchen, find a strong chair to sit in. And drink myself far far away. Escape is so simple. In a world where sunsets can be erased. But distance only loses the knife. The pattern of its scars can always be traced."
first recollection,"My first recollection is a day in December. Black iron steam engine covered in ice. Like some Precambian monster moaning and snorting. Nothing is going to beat that beast in a fair fight. I've sat and watched the woodpiles grow through the summer. Now I'm sitting, smelling summer burn through the fall. Winter's coming on, days getting dreary. And I'm thinking this is the season that I leave you all. I've heard a man in a crisis falls back on the one he knows best. A murderer to murder, a thief to theft. And I don't want you to think that this is some kind of deathbed confession. But run is what I did when put to the test. My first recollection is a day in November. Seven forty seven tracing lines through the sky. Like some old gypsy curse silently preying. Upon the dreams of those who jealously will watch life pass them by. I've sat and watched my troubles pile through the summer. Now I'm sitting hearing my youngest cry down the hall. Winter's coming on, days getting dreary. And I'm thinking this is the season that I leave you all. I've heard that the son must bear the burdens of the father. But it's the daughter that's left to clean up the mess. And I don't want you to think that I'm asking for absolution. But run is what I did when put to the test."
five room love story,"I met her in a church on a Sunday evening. not late on Saturday night. She sang Ave Maria. a little flat and out of time. but that's what drew me to her. so that's alright. As she placed a nickle in the basket. that I held before her. I asked her to be my wife. And there's one cardboard heart. for every time you said ""I love you"". A painted star for every secret that we shared. A dried lima bean and small plastic birds. because you cared. I hear their talk and I watch them swap. their old black and whites. Bitter and beaten. they talk of life's cheatin'. like old boxers comparing scars. All I remember is a smile at the top of every working morning. and a shoulder always willing and able. and all those nights that we'd spend just sitting. and talking around our kitchen table. And there's one cardboard heart. for every time you said ""I love you"". A painted star for every secret that we shared. A dried lima bean and small plastic birds. because you cared. Five rooms made stronger by the breaking and the healing. of the two hearts they protected within. Now one heart left aching. just piecing and painting. these walls with the memories of all that is real. And there's one cardboard heart. for every time you said ""I love you"". A painted star for every secret that we shared. A dried lima bean and small plastic birds. because you cared. And there's one cardboard heart. for every time you said ""I love you"". A painted star for every secret that we shared. A dried lima bean and small plastic birds. because you cared."
floorboard blues,"Look under his floorboards, Mama. I don't trust his silly grin. He's got a beat up Rambler with Nebraska plates. I ain't getting in. I don't like the way his pinky ring. Picks up the dashboard light. Or his short little piggy fingers. Or the way his belt is cinched too tight. Check under his floorboards, Mama. I don't like his suggestive tone. The way the words drip from his mouth. As he asks, Can I take you home. I don't care how many miles I got. I think I'd rather walk alone. Than to sit in the back seat. As his eyes in the mirror. Reduce me to flesh and bone. Check under his floorboards, Mama. 'Cause that razor's not just a threat to me. He'll be slicing tiny crescents from your heart. Without laying a sweaty palm on your cheek. Don't accuse me of running scared. But listen to what I'm saying. It's a fucked up old world but this ole girl. Well, she ain't giving in."
follower 2,"My father's stories fell upon us. Filled us with his light. Gospels, fertile minds. Taking root, taking root. His pocket change would jingle. Sacramental bells. Heads tucked low. Sneaking peaks, sneaking peaks. And the rain comes down. It's dark, and the browns. Begin to bite. Here you will always be. Behind me, and you will not go away. There he sleeps, an untamed land. Dark corners yet discovered. His heart yet to be. Trod upon, trod upon. I can't bare to hear his breathing. Simply knowing what's to come. I can't bare to hear your breathing. Knowing what's to come"

I think I'm going to kill that man. Then drop down on my knees. Well, this morning, God knows, that man he comes a-waltzing in. Just waltzing in. Well, I got my shotgun, I broke down. I started to mow that man down. Yeah, they tell me God forgives you. If that's the case now, people. I'm gonna mow my baby down. You don't put yourself out, you don't put yourself out. You don't treat Margo right, you don't treat Margo right. Now darling, there come a time. You're gonna need my love again. They tell me God forgives me for almost anything you do. You don't seem to understand. I've got your life right in my hands. Yeah, they tell me God forgives you for almost anything you do. Anything you do. Well, if that's the case, that's the case. I think I'm going to kill that man. Then drop down on my knees. This morning, God knows, that man he comes waltzing in. Just waltzing in. Well, I grabbed my shotgun, I broke down.

from hunting ground to city,"To Hunting Ground from City.. That's where my baby took me with her smile.. To Hunting Ground from City.. I never thought that I'd have to retrace those miles.. It's been a while since I've seen that smile. appear upon her face. and now I find I'm slowly drifting back. from Hunting Ground to City.. To Hunting Ground from City.. Our daughters eyes they took us for a ride.. To Hunting Ground from City.. Cat's eyes sparkling, blue eyes in my mind.. We said goodbye under a drop of sky. we left her in that place. and now we find we're slowly drifting back. from Hunting Ground to City.. From Hunting Ground from City.. The journey down is sure to be a laugh.. From Hunting Ground from City.. At least we'll have each other to see it pass.. I've seen that line of broken minds. and I fear to join it's ranks,. but still I find I'm slowly drifting back. from Hunting Ground to City."
good friday,"Sat at my window watched the world. Wake up this morning. Purple sky slowly turning golden,. Distant elms so orange. You'd swear they're burning. All this flowing water. Has got my mind wandering.. Do you ever finally reach. A point of knowing. Or do you just wake up one day. And say, I am going?. What will I tell you. When you ask me why I'm crying. Will I point above. At the Red Tail gracefully soaring. Or down below where it's prey. Is quietly trembling?. Two thousand years ago Jesus is left there hanging.. Purple sky slowly turning golden.. Cowards at his feet loudly laughing.. Loved ones stumbling homeward. Their words reeling.. Red Tail above my head quietly soaring.. Waters turn from ice, creak is roaring.. He says, enough of all this shit I am going.."
handouts in the rain,"You can talk about your neighbor. You can grab him by the collar. You can hurt him only if he hollers. ""Let me go…let me go"". But we all know that’s old-fashioned. And it can only lead to pain. Where we might end up on the corner. Taking handouts in the rain. You can bomb your foreign brother. You can hurt him until he dies. You can kill him until he never asks you why. You’re on his land…you’re on his land. But we all know that’s all over. And that can only lead to blame. Where we might end up for our country. Taking handouts in the rain. You can trample on your sister. You can hurt her only if she cries. You can hurt her only if she cares. With all her heart…with all her heart. But we all know she’d be a mother. And that could only lead to shame. Where she might end up for her children. Taking handouts in the rain. Teach your children stories. You can fill them full of lies. You can make them all despise. One another…one another. But when they all find out later. And they call us by our rightful names. And send us shamefully to old age. Taking handouts in the rain. Taking handouts in the rain. Taking handouts in the rain"
hard to explain,"If it ain't one thing. I tell you it's always another. I wonder why. I started treating you like a step-brother. Love is hard to explain. I know my loss is someone else's gain. Sometime's love is like a bitter pill. But we just have to take it like it is. Sometimes life is the sweetest thing. and sometimes it's just naked pain. Oh, it's so hard to explain. I know my loss is someone else's gain. My troubles started when I found you. But that's when I (wrapped?) my world around you. And now my living ain't so easy. I thought that's what a woman was supposed to do. You see, it's so hard to explain. I know my loss is someone else's gain. I went to see my doctor. `Cause I thought I had a hole in my heart. but he said ""Girl, you're just wasting my time. Because some man messed up,. went and messed up your mind"". It's so hard to explain. I know my loss is someone else's gain. Oh, love it's so hard to explain. It'll make you forget your name. It'll turn you upside down. It'll make you wish that you'd never been found."
he will call you baby,"He will call you baby. but will he listen when you cry?. He will call you sweetheart. but always seem apart.. He will tear all your fences down,. trample all into the ground.. He will call you baby.. She will call you honey. and leave you twisting in the wind.. She will call you darling,. keep you stunned and wondering.. She will take you to another world. where the winds of confusion swirl.. She will call you honey.. We should call them lucky. as they watch their babies dance.. Or maybe call them crazy. for even thinking they have a chance.. They will carry her as far as they can. then abandon her once again,. they will call her baby.. They will call her baby"
hold on to me,If you offered me a shade of blue. would I return it saying that it was too. dark or light?. Or would I see it for the precious thing. that it might one day be?. Hold on to me. If you offered me a point of view. would I dismiss it saying that it was too. black and white?. Or would I see it as the special thing. That it would no doubt be?. Hold on to me. I'll hold on to this gift we share. it is as slippery as it is rare. I'll hold on to that feeling. of waking and finding you there. I'll hold on to you and you hold on to me. If I asked you for a simple thing. Would you do it without too much thinking or fuss?. Would you see it for the precious thing. that it would surely be?. Hold on to me. Hold on to me. Hold on to me.
hollow as a bone,"She hugged his head so hard to her heart. it made her gasp for air. If this was not the way Love felt. then for love she did not care. I want to run beside a moving train. yelling farewells in the rain. The tears will be bittersweet,. 'cause I know I'll see him again. If I lost you now,. I would feel as hollow as a bone. He could not help but hang his eyes. her beauty held him so. If this was not a state of Grace. then Grace he'd never know. I want to yell farewell from a crowded pier. just me and a thousand good-byes. The tears will be bittersweet,. 'cause soon she'll be back my side. If I lost you now,. I would feel as hollow as a bone. You won't lose me, he replied,. together our lives have been sewn. If I lost you now,. I would feel as hollow as a bone. We will kiss goodnight under a starlit sky. whisper oaths at a lumbering moon. dream sweet dreams before the morning comes. and serves us the dawn in our room. If I lost you now,. I would feel as hollow as a bone."
hunted,"Emma's in a part of town. Where she doesn't recognize the streets. Named for famous native sons. And out of every crevice comes creeping. A threat in her direction. Lucy's outside her home. Heading towards the corner store. She stays on well travelled paths. And is always making sure. That she doesn't develop patterns. There are trap lines running up and down main street. Wire snares thirsting for your neck and feet. Susan doesn't like the way her curtains. Are blowing in the wind. She swears she locked that window. Before she went out dancing. She stands frozen in the doorway. Judy hears a sound coming from the other room. She knows she should be alone. 'Cause the kids left at noon. To go visit their father. Quick to your phone, dial 911. Invite a strange man into your home who'll be carrying a gun. Leslie's working late. She's got a deadline to meet. In walks her boss. On her desk he puts his feet. And says, Alone at last. Reanne's got a new boyfriend. And they're getting along. Until he locks the door. And says, don't struggle. I'm stronger than you are. Just one question I'm dying to ask, he said. Do you know what it's like to be hunted."
i did it all for you,"(I did it all for you). She took his dentures from his mouth. and placed them in her own.. Took a shovel from the shed. and then dragged him from their home.. (I did it all for you.). Left a note tacked to the door,. ""Paid in full"" is what it said.. High above I look below. and watch her slowly go.. River, like magnesium,. burns.. (I did it all for you). He stuck his fingers in their backs. to count the holes he bore.. Doused them all in kerosene. and moved to bolt the door.. (I did it all for you). Called his Dad and said goodbye. as his lit match hit the floor.. High above I look below. and watch them slowly go.. River, like magnesium,. burns.. (I did it all for you). Set his guilt before his rage. set it like a wall. to protect what he once knew as love,. but which he never knew at all.. River, like magnesium,. burns.. (I did it all for you).

i'm so lonesome i could cry,Hear the lonesome whippoorwill. His song's too blue to fly. The midnight train is a-winding low. I'm so lonesome I could cry. I've never seen a night so long. When time keeps crawling by. The moon is gone behind the clouds. To hide his face and cry. Have you ever seen a robin weep. When leaves have turned to brown?. Like me he's lost his will to live. I'm so lonesome I could cry. The silence of a falling star. Lights up a purple haze. and as I wonder where you are. I'm so lonesome I could cry.

Fires lit to say goodbye or hello. Which way you lookin'. Which way you lookin'. Can't know who that brought you here. Lay your blessing and hand. Rid yourself of all regrets. Because here is where it all began. Bumblers gain, cheaters win. Where the winner pays the highest cost. You've laid your marker, now watch the ball. Hold your breath, it's about to fall. Just outside they're waiting. Just outside the circle. Waiting there is someone, I don't know who. I'm so open. I'm so open. I don't sleep most nights. Just lie awake and count my blessings. I keep this endless life. Of perfect hopeless mourning. I hold you till morning comes. It's all that I can do. I'm so open. I'm so open. I don't like this last goodbye. I don't like goodbye."

Now his words are swirling around in her head. He said and she said. and they both yelled together. neither one hearing or listening to the other. Words like ""You never.."" and ""You don't understand"". One word, then another. and then the whole thing's out of hand. But love's still there. it's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared. Hang on to those feelings that you know are true. and remember that this person means everything to you. Siren screams, breaks through her dreams. she rolls to the right. She realizes that he's still lost to the night. She gets out of bed both worried and mad. She prays that he's safe, her hanger holds back the drape. But love's still there. it's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared. Hang on to those feelings that you know are true. and remember that this person means everything to you. Door opens and in walks her baby. with a look on her face, says ""I'm sorry"". Now's not the time or the place to play games. so you hold out your hand and he does the same. And love's still there. it's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared. Hang on to those feelings that you know are true. and remember that this person means everything to you. Love's still there. it's just hiding in the dark 'cause it's scared. Hang on to those feelings that you know are true. and remember that this person means everything to you."
lungs,"(Townes Van Zandt). Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?. Mine are collapsing. Plant my feet and bitterly breathe up the time that's passing. Breath I'll take and breath I'll give and pray the day's not poison. Stand among the ones that live in lonely indecision. Fingers walk the darkness down. Mind is on the midnight. ""Gather up the gold you've found,. you fool, it's only moonlight. and if you try to take it home your hands will turn to butter. You better leave this dream alone, try to find another"". Salvation sat and crossed herself and called The Devil partner. Wisdom burned upon a shelf. ""Who'll kill the raging cancer?"". Seal the river at it's mouth. Take the water prisoner. Fill the skies with screams and cries. Bathe in fiery answers. Jesus was an only son and love his only concept. Strangers talk in foreign tongues and dirty up the doorstep. and I for one, and you for two ain't got time for outside. Just keep your injured looks to you. we'll tell the world we tried. Keep your injured looks to you. we'll tell the world we tried."
mariner's song,"The last of man's great unchained beasts. Lies lapping at my door. The last of man's great unchained beasts. Lies lapping at my door. And I'd be happy to give it what it wants. But I do know it would just ask for more. CHORUS. I search for you in every crest I ride. In every trough I travel through. I search for you in every trough I travel through. I didn't mean to leave you. I unfurled my sail and the wind did blow. I didn't mean to leave you darlin'. I unfurled my sail and the wind did blow. Why why why why oh why, I did not drop my anchor. Oh Lord I will never know. CHORUS. On the lee of the island I hear your voice. Deep inside the calm. On the lee of the island I hear your voice. Deep inside the calm. Whispering baby, I'll be your delight. If you promise to be my red sky tonight. CHORUS. In the storm you are my destination. In the port you are my storm. In the storm you are my destination. In the port you are storm. But I would weather you my love. If you would be my guide. If you would be my stars in the skies above. CHORUS. CHORUS."
me and the devil,"Early this morning, he knocked on my door. Early this morning he knocked on my door. I said ""Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go"". Me and The Devil are walkin' side by side. Me and The Devil are walkin' side by side. Well, I'm goin' to beat my man until I get satisfied. He says I don't do him right. That I dog him around. Well, babe, you know you ain't treating me right. He says I don't do him right. that I dog him around. Well, it must be this old evil spirit. So deep down within the ground. You may bury my body down by the highway side. ...oh, babe I don't care what you do with my body. You may bury my body down by the highway side. So my old evil spirit can catch a Greyhound bus and ride. Early this morning, he knocked on my door. Now me and The Devil are walking side by side. Side by side."
miles from our home,"No one in sight for fifty miles. Sleeping fields sigh as I glide across their spines.. If I can just reach the crest of that hill. This whole day will tumble, out the night will spill.. The sky as still as a spinning top. Shooting stars drop like burning words from above. If I could just connect all these dots. The truth would tumble like a Cynic vexed by love.. And yet people keep saying. I'm miles from my home,. Miles from my home.. I met you again in my sleep last night,. These are days of slow boats and false starts.. Hearts remain under lock and key,. You will be the one to set them both free.. And yet people will tell you. You're miles from your home,. Miles from your home.. But that's where I want to be.. Out there searching,. Out here fumbling,. Out here waiting. For you and you for me.. The moon hangs like a question mark,. Pale as milk, bold as promise.. When will you share these sights with us?. When will we hold you in our arms?. And people will tell them. We're miles from our home,. Miles from our home.."
mining for gold,"We are miners, hard rock miners. To the shaft house we must go. Pour your bottles on our shoulders. We are marching to the slow. On the line boys, on the line boys. Drill your holes and stand in line. 'til the shift boss comes to tell you. You must drill her out on top. Can't you feel the rock dust in your lungs?. It'll cut down a miner when he is still young. Two years and the silicosis takes hold. and I feel like I'm dying from mining for gold. Yes, I feel like I'm dying from mining for gold."
misguided angel,"I said ""Mama, he's crazy and he scares me. But I want him by my side. though he's wild and he's bad. and sometimes just plain mad. I need him to keep me satisfied"". I said ""Papa, don't cry cause it's alright. And I see you in some of his ways. Though he might not give me the life that you wanted. I'll love him the rest of my days"". Misguided angel hangin' over me. Heart like a Gabriel, pure and white as ivory. Soul like a Lucifer, black and cold like a piece of lead. Misguided angel, love you 'til I'm dead. I said ""Brother, you speak to me of passion. You said never to settle for nothing less. Well, it's in the way he walks,. it's in the way he talks. His smile, his anger and his kisses"". I said ""Sister, don't you understand?. He's all I ever wanted in a man. I'm tired of sittin' around the T.V. every night. Hoping I'm finding a Mr. Right"". Misguided angel hangin' over me. Heart like a Gabriel, pure and white as ivory. Soul like a Lucifer. Black and cold like a piece of lead. Misguided angel, love you 'til I'm dead. He says ""Baby, don't listen to what they say. There comes a time when you have to break away"". He says ""Baby there are things we all cling to all our life. It's time to let them go and become my wife"". Misguided angel hangin' over me. Heart like a Gabriel, pure and white as ivory. Soul like a Lucifer. Black and cold like a piece of lead. Misguided angel, love you 'til I'm dead."
mountain,"You speak your love. You turn, are gone. What kind of love. You thinking of. Can you tell me how this mountain got so high. Moments worth. The price of myths. Lifting from our fingertips. Reaching for the next hand hold on the wall. How'd this mountain get so high. How'd this mountain get so high. Can someone tell me how this mountain got so high. Step by step. We take on weight. The trick is now. To separate. Secure the good. Leave the rot behind. How'd this mountain get so high. How'd this mountain get so high. Can someone tell me how this mountain got so high. No need for answers. But give them choice. A simple place. To hear their voice. Can someone tell me how this mountain got so high. How'd this mountain get so high. How'd this mountain get so high. Can someone tell me how this mountain got so high"

musical key,"My mother sang the sweetest melody. although she never sang in a musical key. I'd hear her through the house. My name called out loud. My mother sang the sweetest melody. My mother's hands were always cool and soft. And like her eyes they would caress with every touch. She would listen to my chatter. as if every word I spoke mattered. She'd hold me close and whisper in my ear. She'd say, ""girl you are a part of me. I have made you strong. when you grow up and are on your own. remember to win them with your song"". My father sang in perfect harmony. And though he never sang in a musical key. You could hear him when he'd enter the house. the kiss he'd give my Ma. My father sang in perfect harmony. My father's words were always sure and clear. and like his presence they would rid me of my fears. When I crawled up on his knees. I was safe as I could be. He'd hold me tight and whisper in my ear. He'd say, ""girl you are a part of me. I have made you strong. when you grow up and are on your own. remember to win them with your song"". My mother sang in perfect harmony. although she never sang in a musical key."

My little girl on her mothers lap. (my little panchen lama). Sucking on her fingers, surveying the roadmap. (my little panchen lama). Seems to be the only one around. (my little panchen lama). That sees the red lights at the end of town. (my little panchen lama). One day. They'll be older. Maybe bolder. Perhaps, than me. One day. They'll be rising. Maybe living. Perhaps, in peace"

no birds today,No birds today. Just this square patch of gray. Molting sky moving in on its morning prey. No words today. No one knocking at the gate. I lost my name long before I lost my way. I wonder what he thinks out there. Pastures turn from black to green and black again. The sun it carves a well worn path. from here to there and the next day back. No birds today. Just this dull sky of gray. Winter's quickly moving in on its skulking prey. No dust today. No clouds rising from my driveway. No hope drifting slowly my way. I wonder what he thinks in there. Pastures turn from black to green and black again. The sun it carves a well worn path. from here to there and the next day back. Cold bars of steel. I'm beginning to dig the feel. of all that disappears into....ethereal. Cold words of hate. Now I'm seeing how things break. Much too late now to cure my mistakes. I wonder what he thinks in there. Pastures turn from black to green and black again. The sun it carves a well worn path. from here to there and the next day back. No birds today. Just this barren stretch of gray. Just this barren stretch of gray.

oregon hill,"(Michael Timmins). The hoods are up on Pine Street,. rear ends lifted too. The great-grandsons of General Robert E. Lee. are making love with a little help from STP. Their women on the porches comparing alibis. Greasy eggs and bacon,. bumper stickers aimed to start a fight,. full gun racks, Confederate caps,. if you want some 'shine. well, you can always find some more,. but what I remember most is the colour of Suzy's door. And Suzy says she's up there. cutting carrots still. And Suzy says she's missing me. so I'm missing Oregon Hill. A river to the south. to wash away all sins. A college to the east of us. to learn where sin begins. A graveyard to the west of it all. which I may soon be lying in. 'Cause to the north there is a prison. which I've come to call my home,. but some Monday morning no country song. will sing me home again. And Suzy says she's up there. cutting carrots still. And Suzy says she's missing me. so I'm missing Oregon Hill. Sunday morning, eight A.M.,. sirens fill the air. Sounds like someone made the river. Sounds like someone being born again. Me, I'm just lying here in Suzy's bed. Baptists celebrating with praises to the Lord,. rednecks doing it with gin. Me and Suzy, we're celebrating. the joy of sleeping in. because tomorrow I'll be home again. But Suzy says she'll wait there. cutting carrots by the window sill. And Suzy says, 'Always think of me. when you think of Oregon Hill'."
pale sun,"Fifty miles from Dakota territory. Cheyenne scalp hangs from his belt. Found him alone washing in the Big Horn. Steady aim and he bagged his game. Pale sun falls without contest. Here is obedient darkness. He will not return. White Cadillac, white man at the wheel. White faces on the mountain. Wounds that will never heal. Black clouds overhead, old man says looks like rain. Thieves' Road winds to the Black Hills sign. Says, South Dakota, USA. Grass plains stretch to the horizon. Not a soul can be found on them. They will not return. Old rusted pickup and a mad dog in the yard. Purple paint peels but fails to reveal. The bitterness that grows inside. Cloud of dust in the distance. Strange knock beneath my hood. Is it better to have words left unsaid. Than to have words misunderstood. Pale sun falls without contest. Here is obedient darkness. It will return. I know it will return. It will return."
postcard blues,"Especially with my head pounding. and lying helpless in my bed. I long for you and your expert hands. To ease this white heat from my head. And you would boast that you knew. All the pressure points inside. And you could just as easily kill me. Beneath the desire that I hide. But as your patient I knew. That your healing powers had grown. From a sore that's far far deeper. Than this heart where the pain was born. With my head again clear. I think of words to send to you. To coax you back to my side. But always leave out ""I love you"". And then through my front door. A picture of a faraway land. And to with love on the back. And once again I reach for my pen."
powderfinger,"Look out, Mama, there's a white boat coming up the river,. with a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the rail. I think you'd better call John. 'cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail. And it's less than a mile away. I hope they didn't come to stay. It's got numbers on the side and a gun,. and it's making big waves. Daddy's gone, my brother's out hunting in the mountains. Big John's been drinking since the river took Emmy Lou. So the powers that be left me here to do all the thinking. And I just turned twenty-two. I was wondering what to do. And the closer they got,. The more those feelings grew. Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassuring. He told me, 'Red means run, Son, numbers add up to nothing'. But when that first shot hit the dock, I saw it coming. Raised the rifle to my eye. Never stopped to wonder why. Then I saw black and my face flash in the sky. Shelter me from the powder and the finger. Cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger. Just think of me as one you never figured,. to fade away so young. with so much left undone. Remember me to my love. I know I'll miss her."
renmin park,"Meet me on the banks of the Yangtze, Suzie. Beneath the glare of the New-West Yard. We’ll watch the barges cart away the waste of another day. We’ll watch the barges cart away the waste of another day. Meet me in the middle of Renmin Park. Where the stone bridge meets the pond. We’ll watch the ducklings gobbling bread. And the stealth of the approaching swan. We’ll watch the ducklings gobbling bread. And the stealth of the approaching swan. Listen for the song of the propane seller. Bouncing off the walls. His morning cry a promise to you from me. His morning song a blessing on you and me. Meet me on the banks of the Yangtze, Suzie Beside the gate of the New-West Yard. We’ll watch the darkness leach away into the haze of another day. We’ll watch the darkness leach away into the haze of another day"
ring on the sill,"She placed her ring on the sill. Dishes piled high. She's on the front porch step. And the air smells like snow. She's thinking of the siege to come. And how she'll miss those weekends in the park. With the sun on her face, and her book by her side. And that lingering taste that he left on her tounge. He lifts his glass from the table. It leaves a ring where it stood. He sees a light from a window. Caress her like he knows he should. He's remembering the first time he kissed her. And how he'd wake and immediately he'd miss her. Like a spell, with each breath. He'd taste her breath like a haunting. Irritating as hell. Do you remember when you prayed you'd never see the day. Someone would make you feel this way. 'Cause you knew it would cut right through you. Once inside, you were afraid they'd find. Nothing to hold on to. He puts her ring on her finger. She brushes back his hair. He takes a sip from his glass. She inhales the cold fall air. They're thinking of the long road ahead. And the strength that they'll need just to reach the end. And there in the silence, they search for the balance. Between this fear that they feel. And a love that has graced their lives."
river waltz,"I'm going to find me a dying river. and strike a deal with her I'll say.. ""I'll fold you in two and I'll carry you away. to a place where your headwaters will flow. clean through to your mouth"".. in return I'll request a small sanctuary. by her banks where we will live. with our small family. she will water our garden. and clean the dirt from our skin.. While the word clamours at our door. we will dance and not let them in.. and if one day we wake up to a bed dry as a bone. find our river stolen, find our sanctuary gone. we will stand and take stock and be grateful. for what we've not lost.. we will pack up our bags, pack our small family. head across the valley to where the aspen trees. shiver as they ascend-. the green hills rising to blue.. at the edge of the shopping we will turn. and bid fond ""adieu"".. All that I know to be true. is the touch of your hand on my skin.. one look from you can so easily soothe. all this turmoil within.. as we dance cheek to cheek. with our feet so completely. locked in a time all our own.. I stop to speak. but you gently keep me. moving in time to the song.. and in a voice that is sloppy with gin. you say, ""let the world spin"".. I'm going to find me a dying river. and strike a deal with her I'll say,. Ï'll fold you in two and I'll carry you away. to place where your headwaters will flow. clean through to your mouth"".. in return I'll request a small sanctuary. by her banks where we will live. with our small family. she will water our garden. and clean the dirt from our skin.. while the world clamours at our door. we will dance and not let them in."
rock and bird,She captured both rock and bird. Tied one to the leg of the other. Kept them as prisoner. Till they knew who was master. Then she threw them to the sky. Bird with unbarred wings disappeared. Rock with weighted heart returned. And rock became her anchor. And bird became her dream. And now she stands on the forest floor. Among the pines and towering firs. Rock still firm beneath her feet. Bird perched high above her. Singing songs of love's betrayal. I offered you my endless skies. You countered with hoods and chains. This song I sing will be the last. To be inspired by your memory.
sad to see the season go,"(Michael Timmins). [First released on the ""30-Hour Famine"" benefit album]. Transcribed by Jason. Go Hollow boned and feathered she fell to him,. wriggling perdition she plucked. from deep within. Feasted high on flowering branches. the fruit of his heart. he gave willingly for her song. From fresh wounds were gathered. thick sheaves of love. He lay open palmed to her world:. she stretched in arched abeyance,. holding thunderclap and starlight in one mind. Sad to see the season go. I'll miss the crackling of the air,. the loss of all I know. Sad to see the season go. Indian corn and the bitter taste of envy in the air. Mired now in cyclic decay. The nag of conquest. Skeletal arms embrace a withering world. Sad to see the season go. I'll miss the crackling of the air,. the loss of all I know. Sad to see the season go. Locked here these dreams of you,. imperfect dormant seeds. There is a dignity to this solitude,. a sparkling ambiguity. both liquid and solid at one time."
seven years,"Haven't seen the sun for seven days. November's got her nails dug in deep. Haven't seen my son for seven years. And the chances are we'll never again meet. If truth be told I don't even know his name. If truth be told he doesn't remember me. I spend my spare time with my rosary beads. Although I never learned to pray. But you don't need the light and it's best to pretend. That you've seen the error of your ways. The darkness in here is as heavy as a judgement. This darkness, heavy as a judgement. My dreams are now filled with Gilead trees. And other sites that I've never seen. They used to be filled with the fears of tomorrow. And the horror that it might bring. His eyes felt to me as cold as a stone mason's chisel. His eyes fell on me, cold, like a stone mason's chisel. Strange how a mind can always recall. What the senses eagerly leave behind. I can remember his face, rage, disgust and distaste. But to my fear I have grown blind. Memories are just dead men making trouble. This memory is just a dead man making trouble."
shining moon,"Don't the moon look pretty. Shining down through the trees. Don't that shining moon look pretty, baby. Shining down through the trees. You know I can see my baby. When he can't see me. Yeah, I tiptoe to his window. Just to see my baby snore. I tiptoe to his window. Just to see how sweetie snores. You know it makes me feel like jumping, lord, lord. Through the keyhole in his door. Come crawl up to your window. Let me whisper in your ear. Come on and crawl up to your window, darling. Let me whisper in your ear. You know, I got somthing to tell you, baby. I don't want that girl around here. ...keep her away."
simon keeper,"Jesus was a carpenter he died nailed to a wooden cross.. Irony oh irony upon me it is never lost.. Gather 'round now people, I'm here to tell a tale. about a man who walks among you, a man you each know well.. My name is Simon Keeper I had a wife and three grown kids,. a job in the towers cooking the books for the shills that grease the skids.. Irony oh irony, you are a bitter fruit to eat.. Stripped of all your beauty your flesh is none too sweet.. Now I ain't the most honest man that ever worked a skim.. I was caught with my hand in the cookie jar and brother that was it.. Fifty-four and a big black mark upon my resume,. I found selling off what you don't own might earn you the time of day.. Next it was a letter from my darling one,. ""what's yours is mine, what's mine is mine"",. sealed with a hug and kiss.. One by one my children closed their lives to me.. Lesson learned on Daddy's knee,. ""give no quarter to the weak"".. Irony oh irony, you are the polar seed of truth,. you grow upon the open plain the faithful you uproot.. Kicked around 'bout a year living hand to mouth,. then one day tryin' to bum a light I felt my will give out.. Sat right down on the corner, started prayin' a little too loud.. Left my troubles far behind. when I saw them emptying their pockets out.. Irony oh irony, you are a treacherous son of a bitch,. pretending not to care about the heights you'll never reach.. Now I won't start in preaching 'bout reaping what you sow,. this is the story of a half-hearted man,. half honest as they go.. But sit on down and rest a spell I've got another tale to tell.. About a lost young man in a far away land whose life is just too easy to sell.. Jesus was a carpenter he died nailed to a wooden cross.. Irony oh irony upon me it is never lost."
small swift birds,I've been told that it's just the way life goes.. Once the wildest river is now a trickle to the sea.. The peak we risk our lives to scale becomes dirt beneath our feet.. The wisdom of a life time always disappears untapped.. Paradise once given will always be taken back.. And the love you hang your life upon will start to slowly crack.. I have seen people suffocate the dream.. Forgetting to turn that one last time while she watches through the door.. Focusing on the garbage that she use to ignore.. Thinking she looks so beautiful but not yelling it out loud.. He should have thought to kiss her before he headed out.. Just forgetting how fucking lucky you are to have found her in such a crowd.. But we've seen a cloud of starlings rising on a crisp autumn day.. We were handed the weight of a child sleeping and bore her away.. We've tasted the tears that fall when saying goodbye forever.. And we've seen the silver from a waxing moon wash upon the shore.. I have heard about the lives of small swift birds.. They dazzle with their colour and their deftness through the air.. Just a simple glimpse will keep you simply standing there.. Legendary journeys made on fragile hollow wings.. The night skies rich with whistling each and every spring.. And then there's the day we look for them and can't find them anywhere.. I've been told that it's just the way life goes.
someday soon,Someday soon. I'm going to find myself a saviour. Sit him on the naugahide. And make him tell me the answers. Someday soon. He'll look at me. With the word in his eyes. He'll notice the hero to come. Someday soon. Someday soon. I'm going to find myself a leader. Someone who can take me. By the hand towards safety. Someday soon. With only a wink. He'll tell me all i need know. His personal call will come. Someday soon. Find myself another heart to carry this weight. Find another part to take. Someday soon. I'm going to find myself a banner. March when they tell me to. Cheer when it matters. Someday soon. Let's take our place. At the back of the bus. Erase all the lies we've been told. Shoulder the load of those that are dear. And look to the days to come. Someday soon
someone out there,Someone. Out there. Kneeling.. No one. Out there. Listening.. But what I want to know. Before you save my soul. Is who gave this power to that fucker up there?. Someone. Out there. Crying.. Someone. Out there. Waiting.. But what I want to know. Before I let you go. Is who gave this power to that fucker up there?.
something more besides you,"One foot strands before the crib. the other by the casket. A question formed upon stilled lips. is passed on but never asked. I guess I believe that there's a point. to what we do. But I ask myself is there. something more besides you?. Two are born to cross. their paths, their lives, their hearts. If by chance one turns away. are they forever lost?. I guess I believe that there's a point. to what we do. But I ask myself is there. something more besides you?. This morning I awoke,. the bed warm where it once was cold. Small blessings laid upon us. Small mysteries slowly unfold. Yet I still wonder is there a point. to what we do?. 'Cause I kind of doubt. that there is something more besides you. Although it's hard to find the point. to what we do,. do I dare believe that there is. something more besides you?."
southern rain,"(Michael Timmins). The flies have quit their buzzing. Even Bear has stopped his barking. They all sense something brewing. up the James and headed this way. Bobby sips his morning coffee. Says `Have you finished with the funnies?. Looks like a storm's coming honey. guess we'll have to stay in bed today'. I've heard that into every life. a little of it must fall. If there's any truth to the saying,. Lord, let it be a southern rain. Marie was born in Macon, Georgia. She met a west coast lawyer. He plucked that sweet magnolia. and carried her to the hills of West L.A.. She says `I never thought I'd tire of a dollar. But this life has grown so hollow. Every night there's lipstick on his collar. and every morning I wash it away'. She heard that into every life. a little of it must fall. So she spends her evenings praying. for a little of that southern rain. Cars alive on city streets. of sparkling black water. like waves beneath my window. never break just roll away. Tonight, this rain will be my lullaby. these cars, my dreams. to carry me home to stay. The wipers beat a rhythm. Truck spray obscures my vision. But I'm closing in on my destination. Two more hours and I'll be at your door. And it will never cease to amaze me. how a little rain can drive folks crazy. When I'd trade all my blue skies gladly. for your blue eyes, crooked smile. and a steady downpour. I've heard that into every life. a little of it must fall,. but you'll never catch me complaining. about too much of that southern rain."
speaking confidentially,Speaking confidentially. the fire that burnt inside of me. has turned to ash the tortured tree. that grows beside the anguished sea. Speaking confidentially. Speaking metaphorically. the earth I trust beneath my feet. is moving now ever so slightly. I shift my feet but feel no relief. Speaking metaphorically. Speaking hypothetically. if the air you breathed was so unique. would you use it up to idly speak. or horde it for a rainy week. Speaking hypothetically. Speaking kind of cryptically. the sea that raged beside the tree. burning bright for all to see. it just might mean the most to me. Speaking kind of cryptically.
spiral down,Now it all begins. Or continues to. Spiral down. Spiral down. I've laid it out on paper. Instructions of what to do. As my mind begins to waver. Losing contact with you. Now it all begins. Or continues to. Spiral down. Spiral down. Look upon the self. Look upon the other. We need a better understanding. Or we'll spiral down. Spiral down. Continue to spiral down. I'm no where near my peace. As you spiral down
stars of our stars,"Stars of our stars.. Dreams of my dreams.. You come to me. singing "" The Stars Of Our Stars"".. The stars of our stars. came up the first day.. The moon did set.. The sun comes up.. And all the stars did disappear.. Stars of our stars.. Dreams of my dreams.. You come to me. dancing to ""The Stars Of Our Stars"".. The stars of our stars. came up the second day.. The moon did set.. The sun comes up.. And all the stars did disappear.. Times at night in the spill of light. you catch a glimpse.. You make a start with an eager heart,. but it always slips.. And then everything shifts.. Stars of our stars.. Dreams of my dreams.. You come to me. trailing ""The Stars Of Our Stars"".. The stars of our stars. Will come up the third day.. The moon will set.. The sun comes up.. And all the stars will disappear."
state trooper,"New Jersey Turnpike. Riding on a wet night. 'neath the refinery's glow. Down where the great black river flow. Licence, registration:. I ain't got none. But I got a clear conscience. 'bout the things that I done. Mister State Trooper. Please don't stop me. Please don't stop me. Please don't stop me. Maybe you got a kid. Maybe you got a pretty wife. The only thing that I got's. Been bugging me my whole life. Mister State Trooper. Please don't stop me. Please don't stop me. Please don't ya stop me. Well, in the wee wee hours. Your mind gets hazy. Radio relay towers. Gonna lead me to my baby. Radio's jammed up. with talk show stations. It's just talk, talk, talk, talk. 'til you lose your patience. Mister State Trooper. Please don't stop me. Please don't stop me. Please don't ya stop me. Hey, somebody out there. Listen to my last prayer,. Heigh-ho Silver oh,. Deliver me from nowhere."
still lost,"Settling now. Once again. What was begun. Will meet it's end. Running now. Time to hide. Go inside. It's time to hide. Here we stand at the end of paths taken. (guiding light inspiration). The slow decline. The crumbling foundation, the stations, and now the cross. But we're still lost. Waiting now. Dull roots twinning. Keeping watch. For new roots shining. There you stand at the edge of salvation. (guiding light inspiration). The slow decline. The crumbling foundation, the stations, and now the cross. But we're still lost"
"sun comes up, it's tuesday morning","Sun comes up, it's Tuesday morning. Hits me straight in the eye, guess you forgot to close the blind last night. Oh, that's right. I forgot. It was me.. I sure do miss the smell of black coffee in the morning. The sound of water splashing all over the bathroom. The kiss that you would give me even though I was sleeping. But I kind of like the feel of this extra few feet in my bed. Telephone's ringing, but I don't answer it. 'Cause everybody knows, good news always sleeps till noon. Guess it's tea and toast for breakfast again. Maybe I'll add a little TV too. No milk! Oh God how I hate that. Guess I'll go to the corner, get breakfast from Jenny. She's got a black eye this morning, Jenny how'd ya get it. She says, Last night, Bobby got a little bit out of hand. Lunchtime, I start to dial your number. Then I remember so I reach for something to smoke. Anyways I'd rather listen to Coltrane. Than go through all that shit again. There's something about an afternoon spent doing nothing. Just listening to records and watching the sun falling. Thinking of things that don't have to add up to something. And the spell won't be broken by the sound of keys scraping in the lock. Maybe tonight it's a movie. Plenty of room for elbows and knees. A bag of popcorn all to myself. Black and white with a strong female lead. And if I don't like it, no debate, I'll leave. Here comes that feeling that I'd forgotten. How strange these streets feel when you're alone on them. Each pair of eyes just filled with suggestion. So I lower my head, make a beeline for home. Seething inside. Funny, I've never noticed. The sound the streetcars make as they pass my window. Which reminds me, I forgot to close the blind again. Yeah sure I'll admit there are times that I miss you. 'Specially like now when I need someone to hold me. But there are some things that can never be forgiven. And I kind of like this extra few feet in my bed."

the last spike,"(Michael Timmins). Mornings feel so damn sad these days. without the call of the 8:15. That old familiar echo. has finally died away. leaving nothing but a chill. where there once was a mighty scream. And I've watched the flat cars. take away our timber. I've watched the coal cars steal our rock. And now that we've got. nothing left to take we're told. that the wheels will stop turning,. the whistles will stop blowing,. these foolish dreams must stop. Last year they closed down the post office,. took the only flag we had in town. That old brick building. still stands like a cenotaph. to a vision lost and buried in. a very distant past. And I've watched the flat cars. take away our timber. I've watched the coal cars steal our rock. And now that we've got. nothing left to take we're told. that the wheels will stop turning,. the whistles will stop blowing,. these foolish dreams must stop. The longest train I've ever seen. was the train that you were on. I walked you to the station,. we kissed and you were gone. I dream at night about you coming home. The train in the station,. your uniform on fire. as you step onto the platform. the band plays a little louder,. and as we embrace your cap falls off. Oh, I guess these foolish dreams must stop. Mornings feel so damn sad these days. without the call of the 8:15. Looks like this town is finally. going to die away. leaving nothing but broken promises. where there once was small town dreams. And I've watched the flat cars. take away our timber. I've watched the coal cars steal our rock. And now that we've got. nothing left to take we're told. that the TV station will be closing,. Main Street windows will need boarding,. that these foolish dreams must stop."

the slide,"Jesus, sweet Jesus if you're listening. can you pass me to your pa.. I'm having a hard time understanding. why he's so cruel and demanding. with his love.. Darling, sweet darling keep whispering. I'll find you through this din.. Sitting and watching,. two flames busy dancing. to our love.. Grab on to this moment, inhale it. and hold it inside.. Savour its sweetness,. yearn for the slide.. Jesus, sweet Jesus if you're listening. can you pass me to your pa.. I'm having a hard time understanding. why he's so discriminating. with his love."
the summer of discontent,Another note afloat upon this paper sea. Explain to me. how this can be. Another face erased. from this tidal pool. Found one day. then swept away. I will carry you my love. If you can carry me. through this summer of our discontent. Another day away. from clutching hands. Explain to me. how this can be. I will carry you my love. If you can carry me. through this summer of our discontent. Another falling wave. upon this crumbling beach. How many more. until we meet?. I will carry you my love. If you can carry me. through this summer of our discontent.
the water is wide,"The water is wide, I can not cross over. Neither have I wings to fly. Give me a boat that can carry two. and both shall row, my love and I. Love is gentle and love is kind. The sweetest flower when first it's new. But love grows old and waxes cold. and fades away like morning dew. The water is wide, I can not cross over. Neither have I wings to fly. Give me a boat that can carry two. and both shall row, my love and I. and both shall row, my love and I."
thirty summers,"Caught in the vice of heaven and earth. He turned his life into a cell. Imprisoned by the doubts that hound us all. And the desires that we all know so well. His days he lost to promises. His nights he purged of dreams. And he would wake in the hours before sunrise. And dread the coming of the day. Never thought a man could become so desperate. Never thought a life could lose so much hope. To tear at the roots around you. As if in manacles or irons or ropes. They say he told his children that all he taught was lost. And that love and pride and honesty. Were to be gained at too high a cost. It's been thirty summers that I've spent with him. And I expect thirty more to pass. He is blessed by life in so many ways. That I could never turn my back. But I need just one more reminder. Of that man that he used to be. If he would just look deep into my eyes. And say it's in you my love, that I will find the key."
"this street, that man, this life","(Michael Timmins). This street holds its secrets like a cobra holds its kill. This street minds its business like a jailer minds his jail. That house there is haunted. That door's a portal to hell. This street holds its secrets very well. That man wears his skin like a dancer wears her veils. That man stalks his victims like a cancer stalks a cell. That man's soul has left him his heart's as deadly as a rusty nail. That man sheds his skin like a veil. Lord, you play a hard game, you know we follow every rule. Then you take the one thing we thought we'd never lose. All I ask is if she's with you please keep her warm and safe. and if it's in your power please purge the memory of this place. This life holds its secrets like a sea shell holds the sea,. soft and distant calling like a fading memory. This life has its victories but its defeats tear so viciously. This life holds its secrets like the sea."
this world dreams of,"Try to find the reference. it makes no difference to me.. Draw your own conclusions,. add to my confusion if you please.. The time for concessions. and midnight confessions is long gone.. I’ll sit here in the silence. and wait for all the violence to engulf me.. I hate to take the easy way out, now people,. but options are closing down fast.. More things are wrought by prayer. than this world dreams of.. Vengeance has been tasted,. hatred cultivated,. its an old game.. Everyone gets fatter,. people choose what matters,. there’s no shame.. I hate to take the easy way out, now people,. but options are closing down fast.. More things are wrought by prayer. than this world dreams of.. Simple as a folk tale,. deadly as a stairwell,. it surrounds you.. Stupid men and bastards. always bite their masters.. They will get you.. I hate to take the easy way out, now people,. but options are closing down fast.. More things are wrought by prayer. than this world dreams of.. This world dreams of……"
those final feet,"Place my body on the funeral pyre,. cut it loose to float downstream. Leave it frozen on a mountain top,. suspend it high to be picked clean. You said never to grow old,. but you forgot to tell me how. You said never to grow old. and then you sank your teeth into those final feet. Last night I dreamt of owls at my window. I knew that time was winding down. Turned to tell you of my premonition,. changed my mind and lay back down. You said never to grow old,. but you forgot to tell me how. You said never to grow old. and then you sank your teeth into those final feet. No sense wasting the time you got,. you got to walk down every road. No sense pretending that you're what you're not,. when you got to shoulder every load. You said never to grow old,. but you forgot to tell me how. You said never to grow old. and then you sank your teeth into those final feet. Cut it loose, cut it loose, cut it loose. You said never to grow old,. but you forgot to tell me how. You said never to grow old. and then you sank your teeth into those final feet."
thousand year prayer,"Here we all are at the end of this century of beauty and loss. Greedily ate what you gave us, the rest we tossed. We've trapped all your rivers, paved every pass. Pulled out your sky till we caused it to rip. But you've got Jimi Hendrix, so let's call it an even split. I met a girl who has turned my whole world upside down. Stars I once stretched for now litter the ground. Cursed by too little lies, and too much belief. In the strength of another man's words. But I've got a girl, thank you Lord. Ahhh ahhh (x4). Here we all are at the start of another thousand year. All those love stories yet to be told. Ours is this river asleep at our feet. Blessed by this wet autumn day. Here we all are. Ahhh ahhh (x4)."
thunder road,The screen door slams. Mary' dress waves. Like a vision she dances across the porch. As the radio plays. Roy Orbison singing for the lonely. Hey that's me and I want you only. Don't turn me home again. I just can't face myself alone again. Don't run back inside. Darling you know just what I'm here for. So you're scared and you're thinking. That maybe we ain't that young anymore. Show a little faith there's magic in the night. You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright. Oh and that's alright with me. You can hide 'neath your covers. And study your pain. Make crosses from your lovers. Throw roses in the rain. Waste your summer praying in vain. For a saviour to rise from these streets. Well now I'm no hero. That's understood. All the redemption I can offer girl. Is beneath this dirty hood. With a chance to make it good somehow. Hey what else can we do now ?. Except roll down the window. And let the wind blow. Back your hair. Well the night's busting open. These two lanes will take us anywhere. We got one last chance to make it real. To trade in these wings on some wheels. Climb in back. Heaven's waiting on down the tracks. Oh-oh come take my hand. We're riding out tonight to case the promised land. Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road. Lying out there like a killer in the sun. Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run. Oh Thunder Road sit tight take hold. Thunder Road. Well I got this guitar. And I learned how to make it talk. And my car's out back. If you're ready to take that long walk. From your front porch to my front seat. The door's open but the ride it ain't free. And I know you're lonely. For words that I ain't spoken. But tonight we'll be free. All the promises'll be broken. There were ghosts in the eyes. Of all the boys you sent away. They haunt this dusty beach road. In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets. They scream your name at night in the street. Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet. And in the lonely cool before dawn. You hear their engines roaring on. But when you get to the porch they're gone. On the wind so Mary climb in. It's town full of losers. And I'm pulling out of here to win
to lay me down,To lay me down. once more. To lay me down. With my head in sparkling clover. Let the world go by. All lost in dreaming. To lay me down. one last time. To lay me down. To be with you. once more. To be with you. with our bodies close together. Let the world go by. Like clouds a-streaming. To lay me down. once more. To lay me down. To lay me down. To lay me down. To lay me down. once more. To lay me down. To lie with you. one more. To lie with you. with our dreams entwined together. To lie beside you. my love still sleeping. to tell sweet lies. one last time. and say good-night. To lay me down. To lay me down. To lay me down. one last ime. To lay me down. To lay me down. one last ime. To lay me down.
to live is to fly,"(Townes Van Zandt). Columbine Music ASCAP. Won't say I love you babe. Won't say I need you babe. But I'm going to get you babe. and I will not do you wrong. Living's mostly wasting time. and I waste my share of mine. but it never feels too good. so let's not take too long. You're as soft as glass and I'm a gentle man. we got the sky to talk about. and the world to lie upon. Days up and down they come. like rain on a conga drum. forget most, remember some. but don't turn none away. Everything is not enough. nothing is too much to bear. where you been is good and gone. all you keep's the getting there. To live is to fly low and high. so shake the dust off of your wings. and the sleep out of your eyes. It's goodbye to all my friends. It's time to go again. Think of all the poetry. and the pickin' down the line. I'll miss the system here. the bottom's low and the treble's clear. but it don't pay to think too much. on the things you leave behind. I may be gone but I won't be long. I'll be bringing back the melody. and the rhythm that I find. We all got holes to fill. and them holes are all that's real. some fall on you like a storm. sometimes you dig your own. But choice is yours to make. time is yours to take. some dive into the sea. some toil upon the stone. To live is to fly low and high. so shake the dust off of your wings. the sleep out of your eyes."
to love is to bury,I buried him down by the river. 'cause that's where he liked to be. and every night when the moon is high. I go there and weep openly. He and I were married. By this river 'neath this willow tree. and with God and friends witnessing it. He pledged his life to me. To me he was Earth. and I rooted in his soil. I to he was Sky vast and free. of the burdens from which he toiled. Then one night a terrible fight. Words spoken better left unsaid. With his wedding vows ringing in my ears. He gave his life to me. They say to love is to bury. Those demons from which we all hide. But tonight by this river 'neath this willow tree. Becoming one of Earth and Sky.
townes' blues,"You're clean as. a widow woman's washboard, son,. stick it in the wind.. Put the mountains to your back. the great plains on your grille. time to take a little spin.. Boulder looks like the type of town. that I could spend some time,. but in Houston they got our name in lights.. You're clean as. a widow woman's washboard, son,. the slab is yours tonight.. Townes is in the back lounge. with his hands in his pocket. pulls out two die and says let's get at it.. Salina in the headlights, snake eyes on the floor,. Al drops another twenty, Pete heads for the door,. Springer's feeling lucky, sits down for a spell,. Oklahoma City and he's lost his last bill.. Jeff is in a bind waiting on sister hicks. seven comes a-calling as we cross on into Texas.. Townes is in the back lounge. with a fist full of fives. he says, it's a little bit long. but I'm enjoying this ride.. Be careful with the die. when you're surrounded by others. with boxcars in their eyes.. Never count your winnings at hour 23. of a 24-hour drive.. Remember that you're not the one calling the tune. that's making those diamonds dance. or you'll be clean as. a widow woman's washboard, son,. and those are the facts.. Townes is in the back lounge. cursing at them bones. he says, ain't this fool ever heard of Raton."
two soldiers,"He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy. his voice was low with pain. I'll do your bidding commrad mine. If I ride back again. but if you ride back and I am dead. you'll do as much for me. Mother, you know, must hear the news. so write to her tenderly. She's a-waiting at home like a patient saint. her fallen face paled with woe. Her heart would be broken when I am gone. I'll see her soon, I know.. Just then the order came to charge. for an instant hand touched hand. They sayed ""aye"" and away they rode. that brave and devoted band. Straight was the course to the top of the hill. and the rebels they shot and shelled. Plowed furroughs of death through the toiling ranks. and guarded them as they fell. There soon was a horrible dying yell. from heights that they could not gain. And those who doom and death had spared. rode slowly back again. But among the dead that were left on the hill. was the boy with curly hair. The tall dark man who fought by his side. Lay dead beside him there. Well there was was no one to write to the blue-eyed girl. the words that her lover had said. While mother at home is awaiting her boy. She'll only know he's dead. She'll only know he's dead"
upon still waters,"A curly blonde disaster. Lyin' out there. He said you make me feel. As desired as a crackling fire. She said I saw a man. Out walking upon still waters. I wanna lie beside you. In a warm bed. Feel your heart beat. In my throat. And no one, no one stopped to stare. There he was all alone. Out walking upon still waters. He said you can feel the fall. All at once upon the land. She said you don't know what's really missed. Until you walk upon still waters. A curly blonde disaster."
walking after midnight,"I was walking after midnight. Yeah, out in the moonlight. The way we used to do. I'm always walking after midnight. Searching for you. I'm always walking after midnight. Searching for you. I stop to see a weeping willow. Crying on his pillow. Maybe he's a-crying for me. and as the skys turn gloomy. The night winds whisper to me. I'm lonesome as I can be. I'm always walking after midnight. Searching for you. I walk for miles along the highway. Well that's just my way. of saying ""I love you"". I'm always walking after midnight. Searching for you. I walk for miles along the highway. Searching for you. I'm always walking after midnight. Yeah, out in the moonlight. Hoping you may be. Somewhere a-walking after midnight. Searching for me. I'm always walking after midnight. Searching for you."
whalers // mariner's song,"The last of man's great unchained beasts lies lapping at my door. The last of man's great unchained beasts lies lapping at my door. I would give it what it wants, but I do know,. it would just ask for more. I search for you with every crest I ride. in every trough I travel through. I search for you in every trough I travel through. I didn't mean to leave you,. I unfurled my sail and the wind did blow. I didn't mean to leave you, darling,. I unfurled my sail and the wind did blow. Why why why why why, oh why I did not drop my anchor,. Oh Lord, I will never know. I search for you with every crest I ride. in every trough I travel through. I search for you in every trough I travel through. On the lee of the island I hear your voice deep inside the calm. On the lee of the island I hear your voice deep inside the calm. Whispering baby, I'll be your delight, if you promise. to be my red sky tonight. I search for you with every crest I ride. in every trough I travel through. I search for you in every trough I travel through. In the storm you are my destination, in the port you are my storm. In the storm you are my destination, in the port you are my storm. But I would weather you my love, if you would be my guide,. if you would be my stars in the sky tonight. I search for you with every crest I ride. in every trough I travel through. I search for you in every trough I travel through."
where are you tonight?,"There's a young man in the corner playing 'Crazy' all night long. quarters piled high upon the table. He orders Wild Turkey and with a quick wit and a smile. he says, 'My darling, you're the one I'll drape in sable'. But his baseball cap and this bar-room rap. tell me a different story. that this is not my prince to grant all my wishes. Just another lonely country-boy grown weary of the night. Just another boy with a sink full of dirty dishes. Where are you tonight?. When I left you in my dreams last night. you promised me that we would be breaking free. Where are you tonight?. He tells me of the back roads. and how we'll drive them all night long. how the days will fade and the moon will hang forever. and how the cloud of dust we'll kick up will linger like a song. and the myth will grow about the two who refused to surrender. Then I catch us in the bar-room mirror. with his arm around my shoulder. this girl I see has grown so unfamiliar. and as she stands to leave with a stranger by her side. she can't help but laugh at a life grown so peculiar. Where are you tonight?. I don't think I can face tomorrow's light. not knowing if you'll be there to guide me. Where are you tonight?. Where are you tonight?. I think that I'll make it through all right,. but I'd love to have you just one more time beside me."
white sail,"Raise a white sail if you love me. A black sail if you don't. Seal me off in an impregnable tower. Surround me with an impassable moat. I've heard all the stories told about love. Unattainable and pure. But there is one love of which I'm sure. Your fear as honed as a battle axe. I'll bear my neck, I'll wear the scar. And if my nerve should fail the task. I know your faith will not roam too far. I've heard all the stories told about love. Two souls into one. But this tale of love is one we've just begun. Isoldt had her Tristan. But love potions are not what we need. And Paris had his Helen. But it was infatuation, that was plain to see. What I desire is your trust to inspire. This love for you which grows in me. Plant a rose tree on his grave. And on mine plant a vine. As seasons pass and markers fade. Watch them slowly intertwine. I've heard all the stories told about love. Till death do us part. But our love is a vow which has been wrought. From heart to heart."
why this one,"Of all the lives to live why this one?. Filled with could-have-been. No fun.. Countless nights of anxious frustrations.. Of all the lives to live why this one?. Of all the souls to meet why these two?. One, old and dark, furious as a shrugging ocean.. The other, shiny, fresh as a winter morning.. Of all the souls to meet why these two?. Another night in bed with you. Another day beside you gone.. Slipping softly off to sleep. You say, ""do you ever wonder why this one?"". A dusty simple-minded piece of fiction.. Strange and odd, twisted as a contradiction.. A glittering jewel of flaws and celebration.. Another night in bed with you. Another day beside you gone.. Slipping softly off to sleep. You say, ""do you ever wonder why this one?"". You say, ""do you ever wonder why this one?"". You say, ""do you ever wonder why this one?"". Why this one, why this one, why this one?"
winter's song,"(Michael Timmins). She says, 'it's cold where you brought me'. He says, 'Darling, don't worry. you can stay in my arms. until the springtime comes. We'll let the snow drift around us. and wait for the robin and the crocus. to tell us that our love has again found the sun'. Lone oak stands tall,. bare arms scratch the sky,. dry leaves cracking beneath our feet. Hand in hand we've watched. the autumn fires burn -. Summer's dreams collapsing,. chestnuts in need of gathering,. the whole world lies rotting in the street. Soon we will walk with collars high. like ramparts raised for the siege. We'll bow to her beauty,. cower from her fury. sent as a judgement for a slight. long past forgotten. Winter's love once again unrequited. Winter's love once again unrequited. She says, 'Babe are you sleeping?'. He says, 'No, wide awake and thinking. of a dream I just had about the two of us. He takes his hand to her cheek now,. his lips to her brow,. their whispers pile softly. by the foot of the bed."
witches,"There are witches in the hills calling my name. Saying come join us sister come kiss the flame. Come dance in the moonbeams, ride the night winds. Make love to the darkness and laugh at man's sins. I shiver with delight, I shiver with fear. My heart wants to go but my soul's filled with fear. So I turn to my lover and ask, what do I do. Do I answer their call or stay here with you. But under spell of deep sleep he moans and turns away. Taking his protection and my desire to stay. So I rise to the hills, I ride the night winds. I make love to the darkness and I laugh at man's sins."
working on a building,"Working on a building, a Holy Ghost building. For my Lord, for my Lord. If I was a drunkard I tell you what I'd do. I would quit my drinking and work on that building too. Working on a building, a Holy Ghost building. For my Lord, yeah for my Lord. If I was a liar I tell you what I'd do. I would quit my lying and work on that building too. Working on a building, it's a Holy Ghost building. For my Lord, yeah for my Lord. Working on a building, it's a Holy Ghost building. For my Lord, yeah for my Lord. If I was a singer I tell you what I'd do. I would keep on singing and work on that building too."
you will be loved again,How could he take you in his arms. And help you to be free. Then leave you forgotten. And is it enough to cry. When you're so broken. Her cold eyes tell you that you're not welcome. She tells lies but you'll take her back again. And is it enough to die. When you're so taken. You will be loved again. You will be loved again. But will she sing and will she dance. And will she forever. But will he sing and wil he dance. And will he forever. Someday you will feel a love so deep. And you will find someone not lost in sleep. And you will be loved again. You will be loved again. You will be loved again.
you're missing,"Shirts in the closet, shoes in the hall. Mama's in the kitchen, baby and all. Everything is everything. Everything is everything. But you're missing. Coffee cups on the counter, jackets on the chair. Papers on the doorstep, you're not there. Everything is everything. Everything is everything. But you're missing. Pictures on the nightstand, TV's on in the den. Your house is waiting, your house is waiting. For you to walk in, for you to walk in. But you're missing, you're missing. You're missing when I shut out the lights. You're missing when I close my eyes. You're missing when I see the sun rise. You're missing. Children are asking if it's alright. Will you be in our arms tonight?. Morning is morning, the evening falls I got. Too much room in my bed, too many phone calls. How's everything, everything?. everything, is everything You're missing, you're missing. God's drifting in heaven, devil's in the mailbox. I got dust on my shoes, nothing but teardrops"
