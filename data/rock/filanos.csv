bob's dream,"Bob is a guy who spends all his time. Thinking of his mind. Wasting his time looking for the answer. Of his life. Looking all the stars in the sky above his mind. ""It's time to say goodbye"" he said, ""I'll find my life"". He left his house alone, took his things and run. Couldn't say goodbye to anyone. He followed his dream. And then his life began. Fighting the night, trying to find his side. In this crazy old life. Running the road without left or return. Always against the time. He said: ""I'll find my way, I'm sorry. I didn't say goodbye. There was so 'many' light in my troubled mind. My friend, I won't lie, Now I'm feeling alright. I hope you'll be there when I come home tonight. My friend, I won't lie, I'm feeling alive"". This is Bob's Dream, this is how it used to be. Put his things into the trunk. This is Bob's Dream, this is how it used to be. He followed his road. And then his life began"
