and this is what's been going on,"Broken umbrella in the rain. I'll slip and fall upon the floor. Chosen badly once again. I'll learn my lesson after the storm. I love the things you do to me. But don't need your help selling me short. You bring me deep into your sea. And soon enough we'll fight some more. What if we just can't dream again. Stay awake until the end. So if our paths should then diverge, no guide. Just walking straight ahead. Maybe it's time for us to stop. Or just continue moving on. Remember: choosing's leaving something behind. On your way without picking sides. Who knows I'll go along for the ride. And when our story gets too far. Then we can't see just where it starts. Who'd be the first one to give in. Abandon it and then depart"
emotional inception,"Wounds that never seem to heal. Scars that I can't conceal. In a place where reasons and feelings go to meet. An empty cell that is your mind. An empty place with nothing but jealousy. Is it far away?. Or should we only look inside. Pictures have turned into obsession. Connecting tales that should've been left behind. Friendships, still haunting me these days. Just good friends, a list that never seems to end. I wish I could just rest my peace. Deal with anything without even a word. It'd be easier then, I wouldn't have a whole world to confront. So small, my world's become so small. I'm stuck in, not strong enough to break the walls. Stories, still haunting me these days. And I can't help my simple mind. Petty details that I amplify. But still I try. Is it my fault, my fault?. Never enough. Will you ever be enough?"
here it is,"Here it is. As I've tried to control everything. I've found out that I control nothing. Then I get surrounded by protection. (but) Don't wanna build walls between us. So many questions to be answered. Will you see me gone soon enough?. Doctor said no one rules their own minds. And that happenstance is part of life. At first, things seem under control. (you) don't mean it, but stories can hurt. It's a history I don't wanna know. How important are these stupid words?. Complicate too much. I try to stay in touch. So as to move ahead. Well here it is. It'll happen again. I'm sorry if it sounds. Like I don't care about our memories anymore. I hear you say ""these are the best times I've ever lived"". ""And I don't want to lose it all"". ""I've ever lived and I don't want to lose it all"". I feel I'm stuck in your past, whenever I see your photographs. You just tell me to forget, but why do you still keep them there. Just to show?. Just to show to everyone?. Well here it is. It'll happen again. I'm sorry if it sounds. That I don't care about our memories anymore. I hear you say ""these are the best times I've ever lived"". ""And I don't want to lose it all"". I've picture it my mind, it's deep inside. Now what I am is built upon loose ends we should've tied. Can we go further on loose ends we should've tied?"
insert likes,"One more try. Seek and hide. Insert likes. Test your might. They make it hard. But you played before. If you can power up. You will play some more. There's only one way. Move forward, never forget. In this game, you can't go back. Is all you want, the highest score?. Fight for something. Keep wanting more. Don't jump now. Follow straight. Keep it smooth. Avoid mistakes. There's only one way. Get up!. Get up!"
just another,"Do you still think you control. Everything we talked about?. Still lock eyes with the mirror. Trying to convince yourself?. That you don't need anyone. And you don't feel all alone. Saying over and over. ""Feelings aren't contagious dear"". Are you questioning your strategy of being alone?. Time to let go. Memories painted black. Like you'll ever have'em back. Should I fool myself pretending you were just. Memories painted black. It's cool pretending you were just another. Are you questioning your strategy of being alone?. Time to let go. Time will say no"
never-ending circle,"Water under the bridge. Has gone away, hasn't it?. I thought that we were done with this. But it circles round agaain. Where did I go wrong?. Is it only bad that I've done?. Defensive wall's been overrun. Take a different step. It's hard to let each other go. So both of us have been overcome. Walk away... Walk away from here. I think it's time for you to live again. I'll be fine. It's not the first time I deal with this. Let the tide take it away. Relive it, over again. Relive the fight, nobody can win. Insanity, defines our redundancy. Can we change the record please. The standard has been set. Behaviors I've learned to regret. We've often gone to hell and back. Take a different step. It's hard to let each other go. So both of us have been overcome. (Walk away...). Things I lost, some I've gotten back. And some I've thrown away myself. There would be better times, they said. But has this phase come to an end? Hasn't it?"
photofinish,"I will never be first in anything for you. But I like when you fool me. And I know, you'll replace me, there's an opening. Resentful and insecure?. I think it's just reality. Running out of control. So tired, my conscience is full. I'm overwhelmed, a future I can't behold. And even though I tried. You know I can't deny. I just can't stop looking up who you are. I buy in, against my better judgement. Against my better judgement. (Chorus). Falling behind in a race within my mind. Tripping over hurdles that I put up and that's why. I placed in second in your life. These online memories, photos at the beach. and all the stories I was told by you. Not easy to forget, I'm right when I suspect. They weren't simple things that you've been through. I buy in, against my better judgement. Against my better judgement. Falling behind. Falling behind"
pulling back,"You should sense. The bitter part of my resentment. On the fence. You never really play it out. So pretend. You wanna do it 'cause we're special. Broken words. You know you wanna let it ride. . Did you notice my last statement?. You're pulling back. So have you found. Another friend to fill your needs and play around?. . Behind your eyes. There lies a feeling you restrain. But in a while. I know you're changing back again. I won't pretend. You never made a bit of sense. But in my head. I see your face just now and then. . ""Our feelings are different. It's not your fault. But I've got you on my hook"""
relapse,"Falling into old habits once again. Thought I had them broken. But they remain. Wonder about the feeling of my return. Could I try again. And maybe not get burned. Relapse. Go back to the old tricks. Relax. I'm calling you now. Just once. It's no surprise. One jump. Becomes a dive. Falling back on bad habits once again. Wallow in the same rut that I've been in. Just once. One jump and I begin to. Relapse So convinced I deserve this. Relapse Come along 'cause the ride is free. Nobody picks up. Relapse. Go back to the old tricks. Relax. I'm calling you now. Just once. It's no surprise. One jump. And I begin to. I grew through pain, you got me smiling sometimes. Just for fun, remind me I'm alive. Treaty I have made. Call-waiting, patiently. Nobody picks up"
super,"Do you wanna cross the line?. Break everything in sight?. Bells ring in my head. While vision fades to red. The charge is set. We're on the edge... Now. It's showtime. Aren't you gonna leave before the lights come on?. I could play the fool - believe it. It's showtime. Stuck up on the stage is where we both belong. Our curtain call. We'll take it all tonight. With nothing left behind. Tomorrow no one knows. And that's just how it goes. The charge is set. We're on the edge... Now. It's showtime. Aren't you gonna leave before the lights come on?. I could play the fool - believe it. It's showtime. Stuck up on the stage is where we both belong. I could play the fool - believe it. The audience is here, so mean it. Round of applause. Our curtain call"
tone it down,"No need to rub it in. 'cause now I understand. Though all the good you do. It's getting out of hand. Don't overrate your deeds. Shove 'em down my throat. This pride is fucking it up. So recognize that. I can't fix this. It's your own mess. Clean it up or I'm gone. You raise your voice to win. Another argument. But yelling makes no sense. Won't prove anything. Find the middle ground. You've made yourself quite clear. So open up your ears. And tone your voice down. I can't fix this. It's your own mess. Clean it up or I'm gone. I'll turn my back on you. I'm giving up. Stick with your own convictions. Let's just talk, try not to fight. I don't wanna hear that you're right. This is not a war, and you're not in charge. Don't push me around. Fighting the world is a battle you can never win. Push everyone away. So arrogant and proud. It's just the way you are. A needy in denial"
unicorn,"I remember the first time I saw you, with your friends. Black hair and big eyes. You tried to make fun repeating my name. I remember I almost didn't go there that night. That was a close one. We wouldn't be here, we wouldn't be here. In love with my couch. In love with my couch. As the time goes by and you don't wanna move forward. You make me anxious. With things that you say, things that you say. When you tell me stories I don't wanna know. I get disappointed. It's too much for me, too much for me. You've been always with someone. Always with someone. From love to love. You've played a lot. There's nothing special. About us now. So what's the point of you and me?. Maybe we should just stop right here. Please close the door. When you leave. You keep me in a box, but display so proudly. Your online connections. Lovers you've got, lovers you've got. You've been always with someone. But you can't be with me. (From love to love...). Another night. That I won't sleep. I'm lying beside you. I feel left out. So what's the point of you and me?. Maybe we should just stop right here. Please close the door. When you leave. This is something I can't control. Why can't you see?. (I'm right beside you). Why can't you see?. (I'm right beside you). I'm right beside you. (I feel left out). I'm right beside you. (I feel left out)"
unicorn (alternate lyrics),"I should've known before I'd chase forever. Something that's not there. Try so hard to see, so hard to see. Walk out on thin air, straight ahead, forward I stare. Until I realize. I like to believe, I like to believe. In polished fantasies. From cloud to cloud, can't fly so much. Riding high, below I see the old me. Stalling, unaware. Feeling it's ok, yeah it's ok. When you promise me we're gonna fly away. Though I see no rainbow. I choose not to hear, I choose not to hear. That maybe you're not for real. From cloud to cloud, can't fly so much. The ground feels harder with every fall. I should've listened when they said. ""Walk away now while you can"". These wings will soon disappear. How long will it take until I fly high again?. When all that I've got left is. Strange to me, strange to me. I see you're not for real. I see you're not for real. From cloud to cloud, can't fly so much. The ground feels harder with every fall. I should've listened when they said. ""Walk away now while you can"". These wings will soon disappear. And all the spectrum that once was there. Has turned to inkwell, color bare. I should've listened when they said. ""Walk away now while you can"". These wings will soon disappear. Fly up high, fall down and rebound"
white lies,"All the lies they say. Trying to keep you safe. Doing wrong for your own good. Never good enough for you. White lies they tell. Are the lines we all know well. ""You gotta follow your heart"". ""Always shoot for the stars"". ""Hurts me more than it hurts you"". ""Someday you'll understand"". Words serve to keep. You under unknown discipline. Is that good for me?. I'm willing to believe. There's a different way to go. A direction no one knows. Running with my eyes closed. 'Cause I like the feeling. Crashing without seeing. Overconfidence that's been declared. Hides someone unprepared. White lies we tell. Do we understand them well?. Like the words of a song. Re assured they will flow. From your tongue. Think you're too smart to ever submit. Just think again. You have bought into all of it. You've been made to believe and to preach on command. What's the reason in the end?. Ask the over confidents. Sing me a song that can lead. Me astray, can lead me astray. Forget my problems, and drink them all away. Drink them all away. Paint me a picture. I need it today"
you ain't my friend,"I knock again upon your door. Feel that flutter with your kiss. Let me restore what we have missed. My sweet flower petite white. We danced together through the night. You say stop but I want more. Touch the sky, sleep on the floor. (chorus). From time to time I find. You're really worth the sacrifice. Not easy but I try. Push you away, just out of sight. Maybe it's all the time. That you are right here running circles in my mind. Chilly out under the sky. I bring you close, I hold you tight. You conquer all rational thought. I love you so, I love you not. (chorus). From time to time I try. To confront you but I can't. You leave me flying high. The only one who understands. Maybe it's all the time. That you are right here running circles. Put you away, convinced I'm done. I'll lose your number baby, turn and run. Only please return, see me again. We'll pick up where we began. I am your lover, you ain't my friend"
