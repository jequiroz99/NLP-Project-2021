the metal,"You can't kill the metal. The metal will live on. Punk-Rock tried to kill the metal. But they failed, as they were smite to the ground. New-wave tried to kill the metal. But they failed, as they were stricken down to the ground. Grunge tried to kill the metal Ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha. They failed, as they were thrown to the ground. No-one can destroy the metal. The metal will strike you down with a vicious blow. We are the vanquished foes of the metal. We tried to win for why we do not know. New-wave tried to destroy the metal, but the metal had its way. Grunge then tried to dethrone the metal, but metal was in the way. Punk-rock tried to destroy the metal, but metal was much too strong. Techno tryed to defile the metal, but techno was proven wrong. Yeah!. Metal!. It comes from hell!"

The Best Song in the World. it was The Best Song in the World. Look into my eyes and it's easy to see. One and one make two, two and one make three. It was destiny. Once every hundred-thousand years or so. When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow. And the grass doth grow. Needless to say, the beast was stunned. Whip-crack went his Whoopy tail. And the beast was done. He asked us: "" (snort) Be you angels? "". And we said, ""Nay. We are but men. "". Rock!. Ahh, ahh, ahh-ah-ah. Ohh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!.

Sacred doors you must unlock.. Escape your father's clutches,. And this oppressive neighborhood.. On a journey you must go,. To find the land of Hollywoooooooood!. In The City of Fallen Angels,. Where the ocean meets the sand,. You will form a strong alliance,. And the world's most awesome band.. To find your fame and fortune,. Through the valley you must walk.. You will face your inner demons.. Now go my son and rooooooooock!. ..::Jack Black (Narrator)::... So he bailed from fucking Kickapoo With hunger in his heart;.

And we played the first thing that came to our heads. Just so happened to be, the best song in the world.. It was the best song in the world.. Oh, yeah.. Oh, and it saved our butts, because the demon want to kill us.. Oh.. But he was forced to set us free, by the honor code that demons.... Have to live by.. Cause it's Satan's Surprise and it's magic!. And it's a mystical disguise.... It's the devil's song and it's tragic!. You are the mystical-eyed virgin and you're rocking!. Well needless to say, the beast was stunned.. Whip crack, went the swampy tail, and the beast was done.. He asked us, ""Be you angels?"". And we said ""Nay! We are but men, rock!"". This is not the greatest song in the world, no.. This is just a tribute.. Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no.. No! This is a tribute, oh!. To the greatest song in the world, alright!. To the greatest song in the world, alright!. It is just the best motherfuckin' song, the greatest song in the world.. --skattin'--. Oh mama, Lucifer.. And the peculiar thing is this, my friends:. The song we played on that fatefull night,. didn't actually sound anything like this song!. This is just a tribute.. You've gotta believe me.. And I wish you were there.. Just a matter of opinion.. Ah! Fuck!. Good god! And God lovin!. There's no surprise to find you can't stop him!. Rich motherfucker..."

I need a tight compadre who will teach me how to rock.. My father thinks you're evil,. But, man, he can suck a cock.. Rock is not The Devil's work,. It's magical and rad. I'll never rock as long as I am stuck here with my dad.. ..::Ronnie James Dio (Dio poster)::... I hear you, brave young Jables,. You are hungry for the rock.. But to learn the ancient method,. Sacred doors you must unlock.. Escape your father's clutches,. And this oppressive neighborhood.. On a journey you must go,. To find the land of Hollywoooooooood!. In The City of Fallen Angels,. Where the ocean meets the sand,. You will form a strong alliance,. And the world's most awesome band.. To find your fame and fortune,. Through the valley you must walk.. You will face your inner demons.. Now go my son and rooooooooock!. ..::Jack Black (Narrator)::... So he bailed from fucking Kickapoo With hunger in his heart;. And he journeyed far and wide to find the secrets of his art;. But in the end he knew that he would find his counterpart.. Rooooock. Rah-ha-ha-ha-hock. Ro-hoh-hoh-hey-yeah-hey-yeah-hey-fuck-yeah-hey-fuck-yeah-hey-fuck-yeah-hoh-roooock."

Some people claim that there is a women to blame. but I know that its all this damn dope. Don't know the reason, stayed here all season. Maybe that tai stick was a way bit too strong. But I got a real beauty a Colombian dubey. Soon ill be up on my way alone (Lucy you got some splaining to. do baby). [Chorus]. I blew out my bong pipe. Ran out of bud light. But I found some stash I had hidden at home. I put it into a blender and soon it will render. These little fudge brownies that help me get stoned. [Chorus 2x].

the ballad of holywood jack and the rage kage,"This is the ballad of Hollywood Jack and the Rage Kage. Nothin' could stop him when Jables and Kage hit the stage. And Hollywood Jack hit the big time and went to make movies. Rage Kage was left far behind in the dust of his dreams. And he grumbled and growled and watched. Hollywood Jack on Jay Leno. He bellowed and said he'd be nothing without help from Kage. He burned up the photos of Jables and Kage doin' mushrooms. Fuck him! I don't need no Hollywood Jack, anyway. So Hollywood Jack lived up high on a hill in a bubble. And Rage Kage lived deep in the broiling valley below. Yes the Rage Kage bubbled with rage. He looked at the ground and he looked on the stage. The lava was flowin' and broilin' inside the old Kage. As Hollywood Jack climbed the ladder of stardom before him. He watched as his indie credentials flew right out the door. He'd make millions and then he'd go out. and make even more millions. He'd screen Kg's calls and snort coke off the ass of a whore. No one respected him, they just rejected him. No one would represent Kage. Left on the streets of his dreams he would cry. And he'd rage, for the stage. Then Hollywood Jack got a message that Kage was in trouble. They sent Kage away cause he had gone completely insane. So Hollywood Jack jumped upon a jet plane. And flew all that night through the rain. To be with his friend, to see what remained of his brain. Then Hollywood Jack told the doctors, ""You've got to retrieve him. You've got the technology, use the techniques of your trade"". He grabbed the lapels and he screamed, ""By God, you must save him!. Because Rage Kage and I. can't you see that we're one in the same?"". Rage Kage. Rage Kage. There be magic inside that old name. And you know. That you know. When you're going completely insane. Ah, the Rage Kage. Ah, the Rage Kage. Oh, the lion will roar once again. And you know. Yes you know. When you're going completely insane. Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again. Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again. Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again. Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again. Nothing and no one could harm the old Rage Kage again. Hollywood Jack and Rage Kage will ride once again"
