mr. confusion,"Here comes another. You know you don't want it. That girl is like non stop confusion. Another lover. You know you want it. But you've never want her to be it. 'cause she's like an oyster with no pearls inside. She's every doubt inside your mind. On the other corner. The one you've always wanted. That's always so far away. You think you love her. Could that be illusion?. Could that not be love?. She's like. The one you want to be beside. She's got the key to reach your heart. Can't you see? Could be one or maybe three. Mr. Confusion, make a move. Mr. Confusion, make a move. Can't you see? Only truth will set you free. Mr. Confusion, make a move. Mr. Confusion, make a move. The love you want. Will make your heart feel cold. You think you got it. But all you've got is a hole. Inside your heart. The truth is there to be told. So try to stop. Stop breaking hearts. Stop hurting souls. And hurt yourself"
victoria indie queen,"She used to be emo. But now she's into old-school hardcore. And skinny men playing in indie bands. Are not her type at all. I used to know where she goes. After having her daily fashion class. But now she's got new friends with lots of pot. They're taking her from me.... And her hair is not short anymore. I'll be there if you call me... remember those old times. A movie starring steven seagal. Eating chocolate-flavoured pop corn. You've never observed how perfect you were. Listening to fresno. And now i see you drunk and wasted. Rytalin in one hand, the other searching for friends. That's when you see, all you needed was me. ... always there for you.. Victoria... she goes to wherever there are party lights. Sometimes she doesn't see sometimes she's hurting me. With her damn punk attitude. Victoria... she loves to walk alone across gun-fights. But there has never been a prettier indie queen. This throne was all set for you"
come and go,"I come and go just like. I have nothing to say. And it wouldn't hurt at all. If you walked away. I come and go just like. I supposed to do like this. And your presence wouldn't be. Something I would miss. So I come and go.... Then you come and go.... I come and go just like. Those waves that washed our summer. From our minds, photos. Pockets and empty diaries. I come and go just like. That's just how it's meant to be. But I always ask myself. Why don't you come and go with me. Come with me. Is that what you really want?. Come with me. Is that what you've tried to do all the time?. Come with me. I'll be waiting right there by the corner. Come with me. Until we end up tired. Or leave me alone. Don't leave me alone."
how are you now?,"Let me introduce myself. I haven't been here for a long time. Been looking for somebody else. But only here. I feel alright. How are you now?. I've been floating through the stars. Just to be inside your mind. I wanna wake up where you are. I wanna hold your hand tonight. How are you?. How have you been?. Did you miss me?. And where did you go?. Where were you all this time?. When it feels like home. In your dreams, I walk alone. I'm trying to find an escape. Tonight. When it feels like home. In your dreams, I sing this song. Please don't mind. Please don't wake up. Tonight"
driving all night long,"It's not a plane, it's not a bird. And it's coming down to save me from what. I deserved. (at least I thought that I deserved). Don't wanna laugh. Don't wanna cry. Don't wanna quit. Don't wanna try. Oh, baby that's you. Now take look at what you're making me do. Driving all night long. Just trying to bring. You this song. Just do me a favor. Open your window. Crying on the phone. Just trying to prove we're both wrong. I'm getting tired of talking. All alone. It's not a plane. It's not a bird. Oh honey that's not what I deserve.

This far away from me. I always treated you nice but not tonight. You're right, you'll never see. A meaner guy than me. But now I swear not to do you any harm. If someday you think I deserve. To have you in my arms again. You know my number and my address. If someday we ever fall in love. Would you promise to forget. The things I've done when. I was out of my head?. Believe in me.... When I say that I'd do anything to be again (inside your heart). The box where you keep memories alive. When I say I'd rather die than be only a friend (back to the start). I promise not to do you harm again!. I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Remember when I said I wish I had. A little paper box to keep you in. So I could see you everyday and night?. But now it feels like. There is nothing left inside. And I know this song won't bring you back. Believe in me.... When I say that I'd do anything to be again (inside your heart). The box where you keep memories alive. When I say I'd rather die than be only a friend (back to the start). I promise not to do you harm again!. When I say I'd rather die. When I say I'd rather not no cry. When I say please forgive me. Please forgive me. Rather die. When I say I'd rather not no cry. When I say please forgive me. Please forgive me"

So go on. And as my memories fade like polaroids. I see the dreams of both of our lives as they are. Destroied. Cause you don't know what you are doing. It isn't as it seems. Well, you don't know what it feels to be. Alone, alone"

I was born in the 80's. That's why I sing this song. My memories are faded. But they aren't gone. Well I was born in the 80's. And I miss them too. I don't get totally crazy. Only because of you. I had a bike. I had a dog, his name was spike. We used to play ball all night long. We used to play hair metal songs. I bought a guitar. My tunes have taken me so far. I can't remember most of the nights. 'cause of the vodka, lime and ice"

hallelujah (cover),"I heard there was a secret chord. that David played and it pleased the lord. but you don't really care for music do ya.

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof. you saw her bathing on the roof. her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya. she tied you to her kitchen chair. she broke your throne and she cut your hair. and from your lips she drew the hallelujah.. Hallelujah,hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Baby I've been here before. I've seen this room and I've walked this floor. You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya. And I've seen your flag on the marble arch. and love is not a victory march. it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. Hallelujah,hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Well there was a time when you let me know. what's really going on below. but now you never show that to me do you. but remember when I moved in you. and the holy dove was moving too. and every breath we drew was hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Well maybe there's a god above. but all I've ever learned from love. was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya. And it's not a cry that you hear at night. it's not somebody who's seen the light. it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah"

and we'll be standing singing,"Guess we came up in a ghost town.. Now all those buildings have burned down.. Another price to be paid for being free.. It's getting harder to see now that the lights have. all gone out.. Can't pay for the electricity.. And all along they've been saying nothing new to me.. Lately, seems right is wrong and wrong is everything. we need maybe.. And still the beds are burning, burning in our sleep.. Take me away from everything I see.. There's gunshots on the dancefloor.. Please tell me what do we die for?. And by the way, yesterday, bet you were me.. Seen hard days, probably see more.. There's police at the front door saying. ""by the way, yesterday, heard you were free."". And all along they've been saying nothing new to me.. Lately, seems right is wrong and wrong is everything. we need maybe.. And still the beds are burning, burning in our sleep.. Take me away from everything I see.. And we'll dance on the ashes of what's left,. as long as these hearts beat in our chests.. And we fell through the railings and pavements,. while I wondered if they get what I get.. And I promise you I won't be leaving,. without taking you when I go.. See the price of belief's in believing.. Anywhere that we go we'll sing this same old song.. And we'll be standing singing. As if it´s life we´re living. As if it´s blood we´re spilling. As is we´re leaving here some day"
brightest,If you find yourself here on my side of town. I'd pray that you'd come to my door. Talk to me like you don't know what we ever fought about. Cause I don't remember anymore.

Got this here music,. and i got it every, every, every day.. Hey my friend's like that,. He drives all those little girls crazy.. Say did you see us,. In the background of the crowd on the TV?. On a summer's day we go and catch some morning waves.. Hanging out with my friends and the vibe can only be. ok.. Just like I don't remember rainy days when i was. small,. You know i won't remember hatred or nothing at all.. (chorus). No tempremental alibis,. and I'm not wasting all my time.. And I am looking for the truth in this..

Well, you don't know what it feels to be. Alone, alone. So go on. Go on and see how long you can survive. Without the one that makes you feel alive. When you're down down down. So go on, so go on... So go on. And as my memories fade like polaroids. I see the dreams of both of our lives as they are. Destroied. Cause you don't know what you are doing. It isn't as it seems. Well, you don't know what it feels to be. Alone, alone"
good day,"On a clear day I can see far ahead in front of me,. The sky above imagines a god, but on another day. I'm.... And when I fall the hurt won't show up on me I only hope. And if I follow you along well then I'll rise up. And when the burning sun it falls in my eyes. Is when I come upon another sunrise. Well I will walk alone 'cause I'm not scared to die. On a clearer day in the sunshine. And when I hear the angels sing down from up above. Well I won't fear a thing or hear the things I've done. Only know that you're in a place inside my heart,. And no matter where I go, we will never part.. (Chorus)"
good love,"Please grab the seat of my bike. Let us all ride together. Please be the love of my life. Like it was now or never. Please take your seat on my ride. Let us both find the treasure. Please be the love of my life. Let us both die together. I have done it all before. But I Always ask for more. As if there was a way to survive without love. Good love, oh god, when it turns bad. 'there's no pain walking in the rain... '. Good love, it's a samba that's sad like a blues. There's no way I'm leaving this town without you!. Please grab the seat of my bike. Let us all ride together. Please be the love of my life. Like it was now or never. Please take your seat on my ride. Let us both find the treasure. Please be the love of my life. Let us both die together. Baby be with me. Baby sleep with me. With and only me. All that we can see. There's no mystery. Love is here and there. Love is everywhere. We can stop and stare. Baby, don't you dare. To leave me alone. Hanging on the phone. Spy me with a drone. I'm stuck in this tone. Major chords forever. Holding hands together. We can make it better"
hallelujah (cover),"I heard there was a secret chord. that David played and it pleased the lord. but you don't really care for music do ya. Well it goes like this the fourth the fifth. the minor fall and the major lift. the baffled king composing hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Well your faith was strong but you needed proof. you saw her bathing on the roof. her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya. she tied you to her kitchen chair. she broke your throne and she cut your hair. and from your lips she drew the hallelujah.. Hallelujah,hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Baby I've been here before. I've seen this room and I've walked this floor. You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya. And I've seen your flag on the marble arch. and love is not a victory march. it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. Hallelujah,hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Well there was a time when you let me know. what's really going on below. but now you never show that to me do you. but remember when I moved in you. and the holy dove was moving too. and every breath we drew was hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Well maybe there's a god above. but all I've ever learned from love. was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya. And it's not a cry that you hear at night. it's not somebody who's seen the light. it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah"
how are you now?,"Let me introduce myself. I haven't been here for a long time. Been looking for somebody else. But only here. I feel alright. How are you now?. I've been floating through the stars. Just to be inside your mind. I wanna wake up where you are. I wanna hold your hand tonight. How are you?. How have you been?. Did you miss me?. And where did you go?. Where were you all this time?. When it feels like home. In your dreams, I walk alone. I'm trying to find an escape. Tonight. When it feels like home. In your dreams, I sing this song. Please don't mind. Please don't wake up. Tonight"
i was born in the 80's,"I was just a boy. Couldn't afford most of the toys. So we just hanged out in the streets. 'girl, I don't dance, I just do the beats.'. Industrial neighborhood. I lived my life the way I could. My house was all painted in green. I can't forget most of the scenes. Because I'm getting old!. I'm not a kid anymore. I'm getting old. I'm not a kid anymore. I was born in the 80's. That's why I sing this song. My memories are faded. But they aren't gone. Well I was born in the 80's. And I miss them too. I don't get totally crazy. Only because of you. I had a bike. I had a dog, his name was spike. We used to play ball all night long. We used to play hair metal songs. I bought a guitar. My tunes have taken me so far. I can't remember most of the nights. 'cause of the vodka, lime and ice"

This far away from me. I always treated you nice but not tonight. You're right, you'll never see. A meaner guy than me. But now I swear not to do you any harm. If someday you think I deserve. To have you in my arms again. You know my number and my address. If someday we ever fall in love. Would you promise to forget. The things I've done when. I was out of my head?. Believe in me.... When I say that I'd do anything to be again (inside your heart). The box where you keep memories alive. When I say I'd rather die than be only a friend (back to the start). I promise not to do you harm again!. I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Remember when I said I wish I had. A little paper box to keep you in. So I could see you everyday and night?. But now it feels like. There is nothing left inside. And I know this song won't bring you back. Believe in me.... When I say that I'd do anything to be again (inside your heart). The box where you keep memories alive. When I say I'd rather die than be only a friend (back to the start). I promise not to do you harm again!. When I say I'd rather die. When I say I'd rather not no cry. When I say please forgive me. Please forgive me. Rather die. When I say I'd rather not no cry. When I say please forgive me. Please forgive me"
in the sky,"When i wake into the Morning Sun,. Well i feel another day has just begun.. I see those clouds up in the sky,. and i don't care, everything is going to be alright.. And i wan't you to know, some feelings come and go. but for you mine will never change.. It's harder than it seems to know what to believe,. here in my mind i hold you close.. I got to keep on walking. with my head held high, because i see,. the sky on a day like. this, and i know, i will be free,. oh i will be...free. Well i have never seen a face like yours,. It makes me smile just when i think of you for sure.. and all we have is all we have to show,. and all we need is here for free. Just thought i'd let. you know.. And when i hold you close, it's you i love the most,. you take my loneliness away.. I saw you in my dreams and then you came to me.. will you be mine?, i only hope.. I got to keep on walking. with my head held high, because i see,. the sky on a day like. this and i know, i will be free"
life without you,"Sometimes I wish. That I could fly your little kite. And sometimes I wish. That I could shine just like you do. And sometimes you feel so different why? why?. Yeah, sometimes I feel. That you're resistant but why? why?. For now I just can't imagine life without you. I just can't imagine life without. Sometimes I wish that I could live. Above the sea just to see. And sometimes I think. That you were born just to hurt me. 'cause our love is not black magic. And our love wasn't supposed to be so tragic. And our love has turned. Into this ugly awkward song. This awkward song, but for now. I just can't imagine life without you. I just can't imagine life without you. Yeah, life without you. Life without you. Life without you. Life without you. Life without you. You. You. Life without you. Life without you. Life without you. Life without. You. You. You. You. You"
love underwater,"My head is a projection room. And all i have to do is close my eyes. It keeps me safe from all these other guys. Who just don't know what's it like to be me. Well, you're just like the other girls. Except the fact that i know that you're not. And i realized what's like to be in love. For 30 minutes at a time. It feels like making love underwater. Feels like knowing that everything has changed. My house has got no living room. 'Cause it feels like dying every single night. Everytime you take the elevator down. And take away with you the good in me you've found. My heart is like an empty room. But that's just all the furniture we need. That's everything, it's written on these walls. And i go on and on and on wondering what's like. To be making love underwater. Feels like knowing that everything has changed. The only thing that's changed is a single letter. That time took from your name. Another thing that's changed is that this time. I'm the only one to blame. The only thing that's changed in my whole life. Is the one I'm with tonight. It's the color of her eyes. The only thing that's changed in my whole life. It's you. Feels like making love underwater. Feels like knowing that everything will change. Feels like diving on the coldest water. Since I have known you, girl, everything has changed. My life is rearranged. pedro t."
lovers are in trouble,"Lovers are in trouble. And these troubles have no end. They come alone and in couples. And their forms are different. Everyone's all alone in this lonesome town. I just can't see anyone around. Lovers aren't laid down on their confy,. cousy beds. No one talks to each other. They're too busy taking meds. And I just don't know what to do without you. I just don't know what the fuck I do. I came from a place where lovers remain lovers. And they love until the end. They love, and love each other. They don't follow any trend. They just don't really want. They just don't really care about. Saying ""I'm sorry"". I'm telling I'm sorry. For not being who you want. Not being who you care. Not being who you love. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. For being perfect all the time"
mr. confusion,"Here comes another. You know you don't want it. That girl is like non stop confusion. Another lover. You know you want it. But you've never want her to be it. 'cause she's like an oyster with no pearls inside. She's every doubt inside your mind. On the other corner. The one you've always wanted. That's always so far away. You think you love her. Could that be illusion?. Could that not be love?. She's like. The one you want to be beside. She's got the key to reach your heart. Can't you see? Could be one or maybe three. Mr. Confusion, make a move. Mr. Confusion, make a move. Can't you see? Only truth will set you free. Mr. Confusion, make a move. Mr. Confusion, make a move. The love you want. Will make your heart feel cold. You think you got it. But all you've got is a hole. Inside your heart. The truth is there to be told. So try to stop. Stop breaking hearts. Stop hurting souls. And hurt yourself"

oneonta,"I remember it used to be different. I used to be where I was supposed to be. I never walked too far away from home. Well, I was wrong. (I was wrong, I was wrong, I was motherfunkin' wrong). I used to be afraid of what was outside. And now I'm all about skies and galaxies. I haven't got a thing to prove where I have been. Well, I've got a song that you just can't sing along. Back to Oneonta. 'Cause if we hang to the melodies. We may not get through in one piece. And it hurts and it hurts. If we get lost in poetry. We'll write out sins so beautifully. But they're not they're not!. And it turned out that I don't feel that good. Being on the place I wanna be. And every time I hear you say you love me. I ask 'why me? Why me? '. (I was wrong, I was wrong, I was motherfunkin' wrong). That's why I've always been scared of those mirrors. I think that I would not survive the view. I spilled away just what I've tried to hide all over you. Now you don't know what to do. 'Cause if we hang to the melodies. We may not get through in one piece. And it hurts and it hurts. If we get lost in poetry. We'll write out sins so beautifully, but they're not. They're not!. And I got lost. I've got so lost. Back to Oneonta"

save me,"It's just amusing. The way you've found to say. You're not in this anymore. It's very confusing. To be the one who's left alone. What have I done the night before?. There's always a way.

How can you sleep at night?. But why am I always the one. Who ends up in need for a hand. To take me out of the bottom. And why am I always like this. Someone tell me please, yeah. Why the sun never rises up. When I'm scared of the night. (I just can't see the light). Because there is no one. There is no one. There is no one. Who's gonna save me?.
