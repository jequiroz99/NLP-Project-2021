Of the lights and the cheers and the human vanity. Should I give?. Should I sing some rust?. Pity me for my golden lust. This oneâ€™s for the lily. And this oneâ€™s for the rose. Here it is, let the truth be told. Here it is, we would like to know. Here it is, what will the anthem be. What will your anthem be?. What will our anthem be?. What will the anthem be?."
