your guardian angel,"When I see your smile. Tears run down my face I can't replace. And now that I'm stronger I've figured out. How this world turns cold and breaks through my soul.

Do you feel better now. as she falls to the ground?. Well I'll tell you my friend,. one day this world's going to end. as your lies crumble down,. a new life she has found..

false pretense,"It's time to let it go.... The world's got a funny way of turning 'round on you. When a friend tries to stab you right in the face. Losing faith in everything I thought I hoped I knew. Don't sweat it, (it was) set on false pretense. Betrayed but not gonna be willing to change. And it doesn't seem likely to fade. Betrayed but not gonna be willing to change. cu cu cu cuz ya know...... chorus:. It's Sacrifice. False pretense you're alone again. Stop pretending to deny. False pretense you're alone again. All along you know you thought you got the best of me. But you were wrong and I am laughing right in your face. I can not believe you claimed you were my family. Don't sweat it - it's set on false pretense. Betrayed but not gonna be willing to change. And it doesn't seem likely to fade. Betrayed but not gonna be willing to change. cu cu cu cuz ya know...... (chorus). It's time to let it go. I can't seem to understand it how. You turned out to be so cold. You tried but were caught red handed. Are you happy with your role?. It's funny to me how you've turned into such a joke.... (chorus). So play the game until you run out. And play the game into my hand. Lyrics And Melodies By Ronnie!. By Rafa!"
wake me up,"Time is in our heads and it is in our minds. Everything that has a start has a finish line. Do you ever sit and marvel at the stars in the sky?. When you dive into the ocean do you still feel small?. Do you dream that you were running at the pace of a crawl. Are you feeling like you might be getting sick of it all?. Wake me up. I don't wanna live without your love. Lift me up. Take me to a place up far above. Every second, every minute, every hour of life. Should be treated with the wonder in the eyes of a child. Anything can happen when you have to lie to survive. Gravity is bugging. I can't stop. So lift me up. Wake me up. I don't wanna live without your love. Lift me up. Take me to a place up far above. And nothing ever changes. (nothing ever changes). Its shape unless you change it. (its shape unless you change it). And there's no shame in trying. Because we're all already dying. Wake me up. I don't wanna live without your love. Wake me up. I don't wanna live without your love. Lift me up. Take me to a place up far above. Wake me up. (everything that has a start has a finish line). Wake me up. (do you ever sit and marvel at the stars in the sky). Lift me up. (everything that has a start has a finish line). Lift me up"

break me down,"Break Me Down. . A long day alone. The emptiness is so real. Never having peace of mind. Running from what I can't see. And there is nowhere left to hide. Turn and face these empty eyes. All alone, heart untold, trying to find. Break me down. Replace this fear inside. Take this nothingness from me. I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise. Break me down. I try to find myself. I find the stranger trapped inside. And I take one more step away. From a face I used to recognize. Familiar shadows closing in. A suffocating fear descends. It comes alive, uncovered eyes, trying to find. Break me down. Replace this fear inside. Take this nothingness from me. I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise. Break me down. Replace this fear inside. Take this nothingness from me. I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise. Break me down. Break me down. I want to find, I want to shine, I want to rise. Break me down.

Don't look back!. [verse 2]. It's not about the race. It's more about the pace. Sometimes you walk away. But sometimes you have to stand up. For what you believe, and I can guarantee.

The complexities moving in,. and I feel that I do not have the strength,. tragedies plaguing me solemnly. Its affecting my will. Wait now that I've found you,. situations from dark now change to gray. Disregarding my absence of memories,. its perpetually blinding me of sanity,. and just when I'm giving in,. as I try to scale these walls. Jericho falls around me. and I feel that I've strayed too long. And darkness is fading in...and darkness is real. Oh my eyes. oh closing slowly. I try. Fate seems to recreate,. I just can not escape,. Something holds me down and makes me act a way I can't explain. Even now I can feel it coming over me choking me,. as I'm falling behind. You can say you know me,. but you have no clue what my dreams could show you. And darkness is fading in, and darkness is real. Oh my eyes. oh closing slowly. I try. I. Can't. Can't win. I feel something deep inside me,. I feel deep inside. I feel something deep inside me and I can't let this go, whoa,. I feel something deep inside me and I can't let this go, whoa,. Lie, as I try to steer clear, and I try to stay sober. This is taking me over,. And my dreams complicate it.... I just can not let this go. I tried so many times to tell you. I just I can not let this go,. I just can not win. See you. I see you falling away. I see you...you. Killing me softly. I see you...you falling away I see you...you. Don't take what's in front of me, open eyes can see I have everything. Tell you don't take what's in front of me, tell you don't take what's in me. Lie, which one lied?. When I feel it come a way, way that's why I try...lie. I see you coming my way. dreams may fall more everyday. I see you looking my way. And I've tried just to separate dreams from reality watch to satisfy this wanting,. Try to stay righteous, try to stay sober, but then, I can't win. And I know you, and I know you, and I know you.... Lie"

Whoa, after everything I did for you. Whoa, what I thought was fireproof. Throw me away at your leisure. Why have I noticed your smile. My fire burns from the inside. From my insides out.

How can you turn your back on me. After everything I did for you?. How could you burn so easily. What I thought was fireproof?. No!. From the bottom of my heart. I want you to know. That you have only made me stronger, whoa. And from the top of my lungs. I will scream this louder, whoa. If there's anyone out there. Who feels the same as I do, as we do. Then sing with me and make this true. I pushed too hard. All my friends said I was making mistakes. But I followed my heart (I followed my heart). Even when it led me the wrong way. I went too far. All my friends said I was making mistakes. But I follow my heart. Even when it leads me the wrong way. [spoken:]. I am the man that has seen affliction. By the rod of his wrath. He has led me, and brought me into darkness. But not into light. Surely against me is he turned. He turns his hand against me all the day. My flesh and my skin has he made old. He has broken my bones. He has built against me. And compassed me with gall and travail. He has set me in dark places. As they that be dead of old. He has hedged me about. That I cannot get out. He has made my chain heavy. Also when I cry and shout. He shuts out my prayer. He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone. He has made my paths crooked. He was to me as a bear lying in wait. And as a lion in secret places. He has turned aside my ways. And pulled me in pieces. He has made me desolate. He has bent his bow. And set me as a mark for the arrow. He has caused the arrows of his quiver. To enter into my reins. I was a derision to all my people. And their song all the day. He has filled me with bitterness. He has made me drunken with wormwood"
