i'm never gonna let you go,It's a beautiful day. You were supposed to be here. While I try to find the way. To forget this fear. Coz only you can find me. And only you can set me free. Every morning day. My sunrise is gray. I just think about you. I'm gonna do this right. I'm taking you in my arms. And I'll never gonna let you go. I'm never gonna let you go. I can't forget your blue eyes. When you look me paralyze me. I need strong to realize. That they were born to be wild. And only you can leave me. And only you trap my heart. Every morning day. My sunrise is gray. I just think about you. I'm gonna do this right. I'm taking you in my arms. And I'll never gonna let you go. I'm never gonna let you go. I'm never gonna let you go. I'm never gonna let you go. I'm never gonna let you go
