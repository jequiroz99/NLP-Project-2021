12 days of christmas,"Hey, Merry Christmas, Adam!. Merry Christmas, Fred!. Merry Christmas to everyone. Yeah man. You having a good year?. Yeah, It just feels good to be next to you here on the holidays. Hearing you say merry Christmas. It just warms my heart, man. It's like soul food, like fired okra. Dude, I'm having a great holiday this year, It's awesome. Yeah man, so you wanna sing for these people or what?. Yeah, here we go. Okay. On the first day of Christmas. My true love gave to me. A partridge in a pear tree. I don't even know what a partridge is, to be honest. A partridge is a bird. I think it's a bird that doesn't fly. Like Danny Bonaduce?. Um, no, it's —. He's ripped, ripped I'm telling you. I heard he's a little, you know, fallen on the deep end, maybe. Oh, yeah, well. He's gonna kick my ass now. No, it's against that napoleon complex, he's short. So, on the, on the second day of Christmas. My true love gave to me two turtle doves. And a partridge in a pear tree. Turtle doves?. They're nice. Do they have shells?. Uh, I don't know. But, on the third day of Christmas. My true love gave to me. Three French hens. Two turtle doves. And a partridge in a pear tree. From now on can you sing. ""And a Danny Bonaduce""?. [Laughs]. On the fourth day of Christmas. My true love gave to me. Four calling birds. Three French hens. Two turtle doves. And a Danny Bonaduce. That's good!. Yeah, yeah, it works, the syllables. Yeah, so I started to wonder. If my true love, my old lady. Was going to get me anything. Other than a bunch of birds. Yeah, they're all, like, pooping everywhere and stuff, it's gross. They're hard to clean up after. So far she got me four calling birds,. French hens, turtle doves. The French hens, which are the French hens. They're eating all your cheese. Drinking up all your wine. Like all hours of the day. I love France. So, I was wondering when. She was going to get me something good. And on the fifth day of Christmas. My true love gave to me. Five golden rings. Nice!. Yeah, I was finally happy. Four calling birds. Three French hens. Two turtle doves. And a par—Danny Bonaduce. So, like, with the five golden rings. That's kinda nice. Yeah, but on the sixth day. She started getting—. Like Lil Wayne. Or what's another rapper. That has like a bunch of silly jewelry?. Um, I don't know any, man. But, on the sixth day. It kinda went downhill. And the seventh cause she got me. Six geese a-laying. Geese a-laying?. Like laying down?. No, like, geese that are laying. Like, ohhh, like. That's gross. Yeah, I don't know about that. And then on the seventh day—. I often wonder how geese would go about doing that. If you're picking up what I'm putting down. I-I don't want to talk about it, man. Okay. On the seventh day?. Seventh day. Seven swans swimming. More birds!. Swimming?. I hate it. On the eight day it got really weird. Cause on the eight day of Christmas. My true love gave to me. Eight maids a-milking. What?!. Yeah!. What, are they milking the geese cause they're laying?. I think they're like lactating or something. I don't get that. Yeah. I'm not into it. But, on the ninth day of Christmas. My true love gave to me. Nine ladies dancing. Nice! Okay, cool. Oh, well that explains the maids a-milking. No, these were like exotic dancers. Like you can see on the internet. Yeah, it was nice. There was like one of those poles and all that stuff. Yeah, but this is your old lady. That's getting you all these things. That's kinda weird. I know, but she's looking out for me, you know. Tenth day, tenth day. Okay. On the tenth day it got crazy again. Cause she gave me ten lords a -leaping. Like the dark lords?. I don't know. That's so weird. And then the eleventh day. Pipers piping. Pipers piping?. These are, by far, the strangest gifts I have ever received. I don't understand—. Wait, like, laying pipe?. No, that's the geese that are laying pipe. Oh, well maybe they're laying it with the pipers. Which would be weird all together. But, on the twelfth day of Christmas. This is the last day.

Was he one of the twelve?. Um, I don't know, but. So, let's go down the list. And finish this godforsaken song off. Oh, okay. And wish everyone a very merry Christmas. Twelve drummers drumming. Eleven pipers piping. Ten lords a-leaping. Nine ladies dancing. Let's give it up for the ladies dancing. Go ladies!. Okay. Eight maids a-milking. Seven swans a-swimming. Six geese a-laying. Five golden rings. Four calling birds. Three French hens. Two turtle doves. And a Danny Bonaduce. Merry Christmas!. Merry Christmas!. . ~* Srta Aninha *~"
