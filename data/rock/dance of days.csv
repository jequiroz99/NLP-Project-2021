as i fall (the 7th hit),I fell mentally disturbed. 'cause me eyes are filled by these. empty smiles and dirty words.. You wanna kill my self esteem.. Wanna lead my fate to these. envy wheels and hatred walls.. Just take these eyes off me. 'cause I will no more believe.... I won't try to understand.. My life has been a script of scars. and I can't return.... I won't be the way. I was before I broke your cross.. Just don't wanna to wake up. with a bullet in my mind.. I don't wanna feel like searching for. satisfaction on blind beliefes.... I'm sick because. I'm always breaking my knees.... Am I quitting now?. No... my distance is good.. Because your look reminds me something I guess I would.... Someone in my past.... Someday in your hands.... It seems like part of my life. was stolen for the times.... times I trusted you so.... times you broke my trust.... Just take these eyes off me. 'cause I will no more believe.... I won't try to understand.. My life has been a script of scars. and I can't return.... I won't be the way. I was before I broke your cross.. Substance on taking sides.... Don't you think. I'll find myself empty like this.. I'm so convinced. but no force will burn my hands on it.
astro boy,"I''ve grown up an astro boy. (all my treasures are on this tape). I live in a far away red planet. This is my space rock radio show. Billions of miles straight into your radio. I know you''re daydreaming. When you hear me turn on the yellow rocket. Turn on the yellow rocket now and. Fly away the universe, but listen to the music loud. Fly away the universe, but listen to the music loud. Fly away the universe, but listen to the music loud. Fly away the universe, but listen to the music loud. When your eyes stare at the horizon. And people talk to you. But you hear no sound. You can be sure the frequency is perfect. Look, the stars are flashing in red and blue. The moon is the globe of our own disco club. If you come and dance I'm sure you will hear me. Turn on the yellow rocket now and. Fly away the universe, but listen to the music loud. Fly away the universe, but listen to the music loud. Fly away the universe, but listen to the music loud. Fly away the universe, but listen to the music loud"
bad seed,"Bad Seed. Autor: Indisponível. Before my eyes I'm bleeding.. You sold my heart to bleed.. Before my eyes I'm so dry. you'll find out I'm the real nothing.. Before my eyes I'm guilty as. You sold my life to take. a spoon os lies for your days.. I can't release my anger.... I can't release my anger and soon we'll be carved on it.... I can't release my anger.... I can't release my anger.... It's true but maybe it's just blue my time.. I can't let go my blood now. you told I'm ""real"" but you mean ""broken""..

celebrate isolation,"We used to pray for daggers.. We used to let them shy in our eyes.. I've been bleeding threw these fingers. waiting for things I knew. but I was so sad and. frightened not to alarm.. Am I guilt for it.... Yes, silence is crime.. And there's a crying truth. beneath these sincere stands.. How to think or figure. when nothing remains for us both?. We can't fire the siren so. we'll let the blank. fields light our celebration and rescue. the dedication our lightened souls. let fade out in our hearts.. Would you help spread it?. Keep safe my route (just tell me stories about eternal pain).. We'll loose hands as I leave.. Yeah, it's my pleasure darling,. but now how will it remain for our lives?. Why must we think so much. when we both know that. we always end up staring. into the blank sight of our bedrooms?. Celebrate Isolation.... celebrate as your ghosts silent rise!!!. So wait till the sun bring light to your life. and see the glorious days. were made of foolish gold.. Hold your truth and never watch.... memories will soon become another rainy day. for the meaning of our past.. . fernanda paparelli"
ceremony of the mercy master,"So blind.... So blind.... So blind.... You hide your face.. So blind.... So blind.... So blind.... You hide your face again.. You seem so convicted.... your sorrow almost blind me.. You scream your envy against the wind. but you can't clear the tears because,. So blind.... So blind.... So blind.... You hide your face.. So blind.... So blind.... So blind.... You hide your face again.. Sometimes you feel so wasted. you exhale self-pity.. You scream your faith against the wind. but you know that noone will hear you.. So when you say. ""I can hear the beating faith from my heart"". I can read clear in your lips. ""I don't know where to start"".. So blind.... So blind.... So blind.... You hide your face.. So blind.... So blind.... You hide your face again.. You light candles. to play with your shadow. but you can't see it.... So blind.... So blind.... So blind.... You hide your face.. So blind.... So blind.... So blind.... You hide your face again."
fallen,Fallen one on the ground.. Fallen one to be seen.. And you go on spit on it just to prove to yourself that you're the one without fear.. Convince yourself that you're brave ant that you'll never fall.. But you know it's not real. and you know that someday it will come to ask you about the soul you've sold.. Fallen on the ground.. Fallen under your feet.. And you show your courage shooting in his face.. Now you feel like a winner and they're chanting you hymns.. You built your damm empire.... but the fallen breaths.. As you preach it's dead and gone. I can feel it in the deep heart's core.
i thought it was only a brand new start,"Sometimes I feel we have done it all wrong.... Sometimes I feel we must start again. because we’re so far and I feel we’ve lost too much this way.. No more crying for unspoken words.. No more tears for lost time.. Because now I see it so much better and I won’t let you go no more.. I’ve always heard about things I should believe.. I can’t think about nothing since you’re not here.. I see the days go by and break ourselves apart.. I feel you out of touch so it’s time to restart.. Sometimes I feel we have done it all wrong.... Sometimes I feel we can try again.. Listen, there’s something I gotta say.. While you drown in your pride time is running out there.. You have your thoughts and I have mine.... Why can’t we just give us sometime?"
last kiss missed,"You told me darling you're so great. But I just can't... just can't control myself. It's stronger than me, I need to jump this plane. Jump the planes we've made, sorry. How can I jump too if you don't leave me parachutes?. I thought about not leaving this room. I told myself I would not again.... How could I not have noted it before? Was I that far from you these days?. I saw you going, going small to the ground. I asked why can't I jump with you again. Now you're so close to me but so out of my touch. If I could just make the days come back.... I went to your house and there was no one there. Have you left town or have we just changed?. I saw your face, you weren't there. I stepped back and ran away.... I woke up this morning missing a part of me. Even the corn flakes don't taste the same today. I've got my headphones and my preffered Black Flag tape. I'm gonna bike to the sun 'till I can't stand awake..."
left,"You've ruined my day, now I'm crying. I feel no resentment in you. You've ruined my day, now I'm crying. I feel no resentment in you. What have you got taking the ground from me?. What has improved your life making me feel like this?. Sometimes I feel you're nothing but perverse. But that's a kind of thought that scares me.... You've ruined my day, now I'm crying. I feel no resentment in you. You've ruined my day, now I'm crying. I feel no resentment in you. Why must I always find your name behind the masks?. Why must I always feel your poison in the air?. I wonder what the fuck you hide behind these eyes. I'd like to never see you again. And once again I'm here getting the broken pieces. I hear your voice speak how foolish I was. Your jokes get you so pleased (so cool laughin' at me). We were expected to share a common ground. You make me sick 'cause I can see your real intentions. Please stay away from me. You make me sick 'cause I can see your real intentions. Please stay away from me. . Lyric by StokeR."
monsters under your bed,"I tried once, I tried twice, I tried... now I'm fuckin' tired.. Now I feel like an idiot for showing I care.. I've spent hours with you and it was like talking to a door.. Why do you come to me if you have a funckin' closed head?. You're so stubborn.. You're so dumb.. So stupid.... I don't give a fuck! It's fuckin' over!. I just don't wanna hear it!. You talk about monsters that only you can see.. Just forget about me 'cause I will not go.. You change monsters now but I've fuckin' heard it before."
nietzche is dead,"Eliminate the trust and fall.. A lot I can learn (I can learn from pain).. That's how I fell. because of your lies (I've seen your lies).. Yes, a lot I can learn from ""the wrong"". (but something is not ""the wrong"").. Why am I supposed to pray for a pray. when I've killed all the gods to believe?. I am so sorry. but my true beliefs burn at the stake.. Of course I know you taste it.... you blame me because the gods. you could belong to are now ""the wrong"". and you know it's not right to trust ""the wrong"".. Why am I supposed to pray for a pray. when I've killed all the lies to believe?. I am the giant god beneath the faithful tears.. I am ""THE"" giant god, so spoonfed trust on me.. I am afraid you don't even know my name but.... you talk with empty rooms and YOU call ME ""the insane""."
plague,"Plague. If I've not survived the plague And if I never said. I saw the dark coming to take it's place.. If I never read your name in broken windows. Would you stay?. Would you never say I lied to myself?. I saw you walking into my life,. Turning into my air. And making my breath shine.. And now you stand there. And say you're sorry for me.. Say I can't go on. ‘Cause it's time for me to disappear.. Too many things said.. Too many shattered bonds.. I see our memories dying in the ground.. And the words you've said. Broke the enchantment of my dreams.. Then you walk away. Was I just a name for all these years?. I still remember the ""Days of Trust"""
"suburbia, 1986","Suburbia, 1986. It seems we fallow a smoke trail. Which fades away the more we need it. To know where to go. 'cause we're dizzy enough not to remenber. What we've been doing. How does it feel now you're by yourself. And there's no one else to take care of you. No one brings you home when it's late enough. For children to play so far away. The gig is over, and it's so early.... I don't wanna go home. I know I'II sleep alone. I know I'II miss someone to hold so much. The basement is closed. All the kids are gone. But I'm sure I'll stay here. 'cause nothing is worse than the silence. which makes you hear your lowest mind's voice. Have you ever felt like. All directions seem to lead us. To the same place?. How great it our lives shone forever. Just like that fuckin' perfect song. We used sing along. Backstage kissing hold me strong. While the amps are screaming. Screaming for us. The gig is over, and it's so early.... I don't wanna go home. I know I'll sleep alone. I know I'll miss someone to hold so much. The basement is closed. All the kids are gone. But I'm sure I'll stay here. 'cause nothing is worse than the silence. Which makes you hear your lowest mind's voice. Let's walk the whole night. Let's talk same shit. Oh, please stay and make me feel alive. It is the same with all punk kids?. Are we so afraid of our time passing by?. Just one more coffee... just one more kiss.... Just one more sing... it's all there i need. To feel like the world isn't bad enough. As long you're there for me..."
the boy on the road,"So I found my way through this 40 year long day. So I found my way and I'm on the road again. With with naked feet, a naked soul. I have so much to say, but nowhere to go. I have nothing to teach, but I've learned enough. From feeling my life pass by always out of touch. So I found my way and I swear I don't know what. To say to the boy who looks in the mirror. I've reached for so much and failed. I never let go of this growing weight in my chest. I really thought this walk was meant. To make any sense, but to make me small. I really thought being a man wouldn't feel like. A boy with missing thoughts, with missing time. Stuck on the road again, I just know how to walk. And if it's the sense of life, well, I did my part. It takes so much from me, eats me from the heart. But I still know how to dream. I still know a boy who never learned to give up. Running with a dusty heart in his hands. Trying hard to show life he is never scared. And as long as he's still there. He will never leave the road. Because that's the boy that I know"
