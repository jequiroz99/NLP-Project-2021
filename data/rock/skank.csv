a hard day's night,"T's been a hard day's night. And I've been workin' like a dog. It's been a hard day's night. I should be sleepin' like a log. But when I get home to you. I find the things that you do. Will make me feel alright. You know I work all day. To get you money to buy you things. And it's worth it just to hear you say. You're gonna give me everything. So why on earth should I moan?. 'Cause when I get you alone. You know I feel okay. When I'm home. Everything seems to be right. When I'm home. Feeling you holding me tight. Tight, yeah. It's been a hard day's night. And I've been workin' like a dog. It's been a hard day's night. I should be sleepin' like a log. But when I get home to you. I find the things that you do.

i want you,"The guilty undertaker sighs. The lonesome organ grinder cries. The silver saxophones say I should refuse you. The cracked bells and washed-out horns. Blow into my face with scorns. But it's not that way. I wasn't born to lose you. I want you, I want you. I want you so bad. Honey, I want you. The drunken politician leaps. Upon the street where mothers weep. And the saviors who are fast asleep. They wait for you. And I wait for them to interrupt. Me drinkin' from my broken cup. And ask me to. Open up the gate for you. I want you, I want you. I want you so bad. Honey, I want you. Now all my fathers, they've gone down. True love they've been without it. But all their daughters put me down. 'Cause I don't think about it. Well, I return to Queen of Spades. And talk with my chambermaid. She knows that I'm not afraid. To look at her. She is good to me. And there's nothing she doesn't see. She knows where I'd like to be. But it doesn't matter. I want you, I want you. I want you so bad. Honey, I want you. Now your dancing child whit Chinese suit. He spoke to me, I took his flute. No, I wasn't very cute to him. Was I?. But I did it, though, because he lied. Because he took you for a ride. And because time was on his side. And because I?. I want you, I want you. I want you so bad. Honey, I want you"
let me try again,"I know I said that I was leaving. But I couldn't say goodbye. It was only self deceiving. To walk away from someone who. Means everything in life to you. You learn from every lonely day. I've learned and now I'm back to say. Let me try again. Think of all we had before. Let me try once more. We can have it all. You and I again. Please forgive me or I'II die. Let me try again. I was such a fool to doubt you. To try to go it all alone. There's no sense in life without you. Now all do is just exist. And think about the chance I've missed. To beg, is not an easy task. Pride, such a foolish mask. Let me try again. Think of all we had before. Let me try once more. We can have it all. You and I again. Please forgive me or I'II die. Let me try again"
