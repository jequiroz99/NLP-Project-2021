set free,I guess there's only one place to go from here. I think the options are clear anyway. I´m sure you´re tired of waiting for me. To figure out where you fit in. I guess I´m afraid of what we could be. Cause I don't want to sell you short of your dreams. I´m sorry for making you wait for me. Cause I don't want to hold you down. But I don't want to set you free. I don't want to make you run from me. I guess it's hard to believe that I. Could make myself give up. After all this time you and me. Trying hard to make sense of our differences. Pretending we both had everything. I guess I believed in our fantasy. You only loved the one you wanted me to be. I´m sorry for breaking your faith in me. I don't want to hold you down. But what if you're more than I could please. Could you accept apologies?. I don't want to squander all your time. I don't want to mislead you. I think we both knew that it was done. Sorry I had to be the one. Sometimes I wish it were the other way around. I wish you weren't supposed to be. Set free
