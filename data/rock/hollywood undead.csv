lion,"I am a lion and I want to be free. Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?. Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep. Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be. How can I sleep at night, there's a war inside my head?. I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed. I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed. Cause I am a lion and you are dead. . Here's a story of everything we'll ever be. You can hide but some of us can never leave. And if you go I don't need those little things. They remind me of all our little dreams. Can you hear the words, all I can say?. We can watch the world even if they walk away. Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today. You were born a lion and a lion you will stay. . I am a lion and I want to be free. Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?. Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep. Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be. . Remember an army, of all those little kids. Living life like they only get a little bit. It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle and. I'd rather die, won't watch you giving in. I'm sorry daughter but your father's not the same. I can look into your eyes and I'll swear that I will change. But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I stay. You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain. After all, only so much we can say. Words can lose their meaning, once you walk away. Promise that you'll love me, watch me as I fade. I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave. The hands on the clock, and the things we cannot change. Tear it all to pieces, and take back what I made. If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save. Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay. . I am a lion and I want to be free. Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?. Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep. Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be. . Hey!. I never meant to let go. All I want and you're all I ever wanna know. Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home, of a pretty home, of a pretty home. Hey!. I never meant to let go. All I want and you're all I ever wanna know. Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home, of a pretty home, of a pretty home. Hey!. . I am a lion and I want to be free. Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?. Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep. Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be"

hear me now,"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,. I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out my chest.. I keep searching for something that I never seem to find.. But maybe I wonâ€™t, because I left it all behind.. Now Iâ€™m stuck with this, and thatâ€™ll never change. Always a part of me, until the very last day.. Where to go from here? What road to travel on?. I spent my whole life choosing, and I always chose wrong.. Will I try to have the will to be alive?. Will I try because Iâ€™ve never seen the light?. Blow it to the ground and itâ€™s now you see,. You spent your whole life taking the best of me. Whereâ€™d you go? Whereâ€™s your home?. Howâ€™d you end up all alone?. Can you hear me now?. Thereâ€™s no light, thereâ€™s no sound.. Hard to breathe, when youâ€™re underground.. Can you hear me now? Hear me now. How low can I keep pretending to be?. That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me.. Heaven will open up if I live on my knees.. A man of many words, but a man of few deeds.. Walking these streets, so absent of hope.. A pillow of concrete, a man with no home.. Lend him a hand, then weâ€™re walking the way.. Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame.. So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight.. When you wake up, you know itâ€™s darker than last night.. Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by.. Born to walk away, been walking my whole life.. Whereâ€™d you go? Whereâ€™s your home?. Howâ€™d you end up all alone?. Can you hear me now?. Thereâ€™s no light, thereâ€™s no sound.. Hard to breathe, when youâ€™re underground.. Can you hear me now? Hear me now. Look into my eyes and I see. What do I see? Nothing at all. Take another look around me. What do I see? Nothing at all. Whereâ€™d you go? Whereâ€™s your home?. Howâ€™d you end up all alone?. Can you hear me now?. Thereâ€™s no light, thereâ€™s no sound.. Hard to breathe, when youâ€™re underground.. Can you hear me now? Hear me now. Can you hear me? Hear me now"
day of the dead,"Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. We come from a world of oblivion bad dreams. I got all I need strapped right to my hamstrings. I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things. I'm really not a mad man, the voices keep asking. Born with a soul that don't wanna be saved. Every time I look around I see what a fiend made. Every time I die, I hope they're diggin' up my grave. An undead one like the flag that I wave. I'm not afraid to cross on this cocaine sickness. I'm not afraid to die, let the good book witness. An undead one like the flag that I wave. The day of the dead and you're on our hit list. So come all you misfits!. Bitch, you're on our hit list!. Chorus. Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. So long to the ones you know. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. This is exactly what has to be done. It happens so gradualy. It's like I magically happened. To be this phantom that candidly. Lets his dagger cut jaggedly. While you're gaspin' so rapidly. While you gag on this rag. I see you laughing so happly. It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark. I'll just wait here to swallow this soul and tear you apart. And I've already started, there ain't no savin' your heart. This is the day of the dead, this is no day in the park. Here I come, here I come, down your guns and crossbows. And run, better run from the skull and crossbones. The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow. When I'm done, I ain't done, 'cause it's hell that follows. Now get ready for sorrow. 'cause it's hell that follows. Chorus. Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. So long to the ones you know. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. When the ashes start to rise. And the moon falls from the sky. And thousand candles burn into the night. When the angels softly cry. On the plains below the sky. Will thousand souls still pray for you and I?. Chorus. Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. So long to the ones you know. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead"

young,"We are young. But we have heart. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are strong. But we don't belong. Born in this world as it all falls apart. I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain. I see the love, I see the hate, I see this world that we can make. I see the life, I see the sky, Give it all to see you fly. Yes, we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made it. Watch the beauty of all our lies passing right before my eyes. I hear the hate in all your words, all the words to make us hurt. We get so sick oh so sick, we never wanted all this. Medication for the kids with no reason to live. So we. March to the drums of the dammed. as we come. Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb. We are young. But we have heart. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are strong. We don't belong. Born in this world as it all falls apart. As we walk among these shadows, in these streets, these fields of battle. Take it up, we wear the medal, raise your hands with burning candles. Hear us whisper in the dark, in the rain you see the spark. Feel the beating of our hearts, fleeting hope as we depart. All together, walk alone against all we've ever known. All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home. But you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts. Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart. So we. March to the drums of the dammed. as we come. Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb. We are young. But we have heart. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We are strong. We don't belong. Born in this world as it all falls apart. We will fight or we will fall. Till the angels save us all. We will fight or we will fall. Till the angels save us all. We will fight or we will fall.

"this love, this hate","In a time of need. Only few can see what's wrong. Millions tend to crawl. But only those who choose can make it through this all. Only few can sing like lions. Cuz we sing until we're gone. And we've got each others backs. Until we're back where we belong. A woman held my shield. And through the battle we did wrong. A man who tell me wisdom through the static we were gone. And maybe when we're gone they'll look into the stars. Every starts got its ending. Even when we've learned to rise above it all. These lies are leading me astray. It's to much for me to stay. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. I see you so please stay strong. I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. And we once also had a story too. You can see that only good men come in few. Even in our greatest moments. We may win or we may lose. Every songs got its rules. You've got to learn to make it through. Maybe one day we can choose. How it feels to be a woman or a man. Without rules we're buried underneath. There's a picture glue. So when my body burns in ashes only sing the truth. Let these words strengthen all your views. Because these words were meant for you. These lies are leading me astray. It's to much for me to stay. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. I see you so please stay strong. I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. And now I'm floatin right above my coffin as it closes. I look down and I see ???. As she's cryin on my mama's shoulder. I look up into the sky as the gates of heaven open. Somethings wrong is this destiny or am I going home. What will happen to my soul. Will I come back I don't know. Will you meet me when it's over and you know. You can meet me here in heaven. Don't you ever let me go. This love, this hate. Is burning me away. These lies are leading me astray. It's to much for me to stay. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. I see you so please stay strong. I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. These lies are leading me astray. It's to much for me to stay. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. I see you so please stay strong. I'll sing you one last sone and then I'm gone. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. This love, this hate. It's burning me away. This love, this hate. Is burning me away"
outside,[Danny]. Someone left the door open. Who left me outside. I'm bent I'm not broken. Come live in my life. All the words left unspoken. All the pages I write. On my knees and I'm hoping. That someones holds me tonight. Hold me tonight. [Johnny 3 Tears]. Welcome to the world. Ya know the landing it was wasted. The blood upon your hands. And the wickedness that made it. Seem to scream it all. And the memories get faded. See the exit wound. And God would have me take it. I guess I'll say a prayer. And I'll kiss into the air. I look up to the sky. Send them straight to nowhere. We all dug the grave. Can't shake away the shame. Can't quiver in the sky. But your shaking all the same. You left us with the guns. And all of 'em were unloaded. Teach us how to shoot. But you taught us how to hold them. All the weight of the world. Is right between your shoulders. Heavy is the heart. When the world keeps growing colder. [Danny]. Who left the door open?. Who left me outside?. I'm on my knees and I'm hoping. That someones holds me tonight. Hold me tonight. [Johnny 3 Tears]. Two sides to every story. Here's a little morning glory. Breakfast of a mirror dying slow. Seems a little boring. Burn it like a flag. Walk it straight into the breeze. Cause there's two types of people. You are weak or you are me. Yeah what's another life time. Like mine. We all die sometimes. It's alright. If you've come to say your goodbyes. To this life. We all hurt a little sometimes. We're alright. So mothers hold your children. Don't you ever let 'em go. There is weakness in your grip. And they are holding all you hope. Don't you ever let me go. (Don't you ever let me go). Don't you ever let me go. (Don't you ever let me go). [Danny]. Who left the door open?. Who left me outside?. I'm on my knees and I'm hoping. That someones holds me tonight. Hold me tonight. Someone left the door open. Who left me outside. I'm bent I'm not broken. Come live in my life. All the words left unspoken. All the pages I write. On my knees and I'm hoping. That someones holds me tonight. Hold me tonight

christmas in hollywood,"[chorus x2 ]. Deuce. It's christmas in hollywood. Santa's back up in the hood. So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck. It's chanukah in inglewood. The dradles spinning in the hood. So meet me by the manura lets get drunk. J-Dog and Charlie Scene. Just a little story about last christmas. About some bad kids who were full of wishes. We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin. The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin. Little timmy stole from 7-11. So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens. We drank in his room with some dude named kevin. But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents. Zack got caught with a bottle of jack. So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack. He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack. So we took the beer back and I fucked him in the ass!!!. It's charlie scene got egg nog in my flask. The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped. Like oh my god is that saint nick?. Kids give me your list like its the 25th. Been accused of being a bad kid. But I get presents as is. Cause mrs. clause just myspace'd me. I blew off a date on christmas eve.. So I don't give a fuck if your naughty or nice. You might still get a rolly (rolex) and a gang on ice. So write your list and never have no fear. Have a hollywood christmas and an undead new year!!!!. Fuck yeah!!!. Deuce. It's christmas in hollywood. Santa's back up in the hood. So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck. It's chanukah in inglewood. The dradles spinning in the hood. So meet me by the manura lets get drunk. Johnny 3 Tears and Da Kurlzz. Bout to serve it up for for all you boys and girls.. Good kids, bad and even da kurlzz.. We were chillin at home and deckin the halls.. So I checked my phone and santa had called.. He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve.. He said that his jolly ass needed some help.. He said christmas aint a gang but a way of life.. ""if you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife."". So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle,. Funnier than fuck you can ask chris kringle.. So we all took flight but something was fishy.. He asked for road head and started to kiss me.. Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows.. Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's.. I pulled down his beard and it was a monster.. It wasn't saint nick it was a fuckin imposter.. When we found out he started to pout.. I took my bandana and I choked him out.. I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth.. Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south.. I had a lot of wild nights but tonight was the craziest,. Met a lot of jeff's but this one was shadiest.. When it comes to cheer that motherfuckers a grinch.. So if you don't like christmas fuck you bitch!!!. Deuce. It's christmas in hollywood. Santa's back up in the hood. So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck. It's chanukah in inglewood. The dradles spinning in the hood. So meet me by the manura lets get drunk. Lets get drunk (x5). It's christmas in hollywood. Santa's back up in the hood. So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck.

let go,"Waking up I don't feel alive. How fucked up are we inside?. Breaking up in your empty eyes. Where's the truth in all your lies?. Watched you cry, you felt me die. These tears could fill up an empty tide. Looking for a last goodbye. I burned the world for you and I. If I could do it again. Would it be alright?. Or am I living a sin. Just being by your side. Wake up fuck love. Just tampering off your make up. Wake up, enough's enough. I sold my soul for tainted love. Let go. Love isn't good enough. Let go. Love isn't good enough. And the waves in the sea. They slip away just like me. So let go, oh. You weren't good enough. All those empty eyes. They were twisted by design. What was hidden right behind. Sometimes fear can leave you blind. Yeah, God forsakes the ones who make. A tepid heart go hard and break them. I'm vicious now, fucking vicious now. Some remember every story. Every inch between the lonely. Every voice that ever told me. Only one could ever hold me. Felt it in between. I remember when I dream. But you're vicious now, yeah you're vicious now. Let go. Love isn't good enough. Let go. Love isn't good enough. And the waves in the sea. They slip away just like me. So let go, oh. You weren't good enough. What's love? It's true. Dark hearts don't break, they brew. Fuck love, fuck you. I'm dying just to hurt you too. Let go. Love isn't good enough. Let go. Love isn't good enough. And the waves in the sea. They slip away just like me. So let go, oh. You weren't good enough. Only dark hearts. Only dark hearts. Only dark hearts. (You're vicious now, yeah you're vicious now!). Only dark hearts.

And the undead are your family. We'll take you to the end. Turn your regret into agony. And I'll never let you go. Cuz I know you'll come back to me. I'm the reason you came here. I'm the American Tragedy. (Been To Hell). I can show you the devil. (Down You Fell). Can't hold yourself together. (Soul To Sell). Down here you'll live forever.

believe,"[Danny] :. I can't believe. That when I breath. There's something good inside of me. Just one good thing inside of me. So close to me. That memory. Of that one good thing inside of me. Just one good thing inside of me. If I went out the back door nobody would stop me. But where would I go?. Cause I ain't never had a real home. So what do I know?. So I could keep running, hide until they find me. But what would that do?. If they could only know what I knew. What would it prove?. I should of seen the writing on the wall. Instead I'm left to fall. Cause the longer I'm away. The more we stay the same. Looking Back where I thought I knew it all. Instead I'm left to fall. Did I throw it all away?. I can't believe. That when I breath. There's something good inside of me. Just one good thing inside of me. So close to me. That memory. Of that one good thing inside of me. Just one good thing inside of me. [Johnny 3 Tears] :. Don't you know, little boy, they'll lay you to waste man. Little do they know every song has a life span. Never taken one, but I'm taking my last chance. To hold all we know and let go with both hands. So don't you know the clouds are made from concrete?. Right through the stone can you hear my heart beat?. Beats through my bones like the memory left me. Not for a second or a minute when I dream. I wanna go home like the home that I keep. You can dig 6, or 66 feat. We can live forever still your misery missed me. Hold this song together with a bottle of whiskey. Look into the mirror at the lines that time drew. See them painted white and the eyes that shine through. My heart beats heavy in an open chest. And I wanna say goodbye, but there's nobody left. [Danny] :. I can't believe. That when I breath. There's something good inside of me. Just one good thing inside of me. So close to me. That memory. Of that one good thing inside of me. Just one good thing inside of me. [J-Dog] :. I broke it all and I put to the rest. Put your hand to mine and feel the emptiness. There's no beat in my chest, cause there's nothing left. No it ain't goodbye, it's a last caress. What another dream, you can hardly sleep. Can you believe bad things only happen to me. God knows one day you will finally see. That scars will heal but were meant to bleed. Do you realize I would lie for you?. Please have my last breath, I would die for you. I know I'm no good but my heart beats true. You know I'm gonna fight, though I might be scared to lose. You took me in and I fucked it up again. An empty promise, no I won't pretend. Cause in the end we need someone to solve 'em. Nobody can fix me if I'm part of the problem. [Danny] :. I can't believe. That when I breath. There's something good inside of me. Just one good thing inside of me. So close to me. That memory. Of that one good thing inside of me. Just one good thing inside of me"

bullet,"My legs are dangling off the edge,. The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,. I think I'll slit my wrists again. And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.. My legs are dangling off the edge,. A stomach full of pills didn't work again,. I'll put a bullet in my head. And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.. Gone too far and yeah I'm gone again,. It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends,. I'm sitting on the edge with my 2 best friends,. Ones a bottle of pills, ones a bottle of gin,. I'm 20 stories up, yeah I'm up at the top,. I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off,. Asphalt to me has never looked so soft,. I bet my momma found my letter. Now shes calling the cops,. I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it,. 'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance,. Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent,. 'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is,. I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife,. But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice,. I never bought a suit before in my life,. But when you go to meet God. You know you wanna look nice.. So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.. My legs are dangling off the edge,. The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,. I think I'll slit my wrists again. And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,. My legs are dangling off the edge,. A stomach full of pills didn't work again,. I'll put a bullet in my head. And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.. We hit the sky, there goes the light. No more sun, why's it always night?. When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream,. When you can't dream, well, what's life mean?. We feel a little pity, but don't empathize. The old are getting older, watch a young man die,. A Mother and a Son and someone you know. Smile at each other and realize you don't,. You don't know what happened to that kid you raised,. What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay?. I didn't know 'cause you didn't say,. Now Momma feels guilt, yeah Momma feels pain,. When you were young, you never thought you'd die,. Found that you could but too scared to try,. You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye,. Climb to the roof to see if you could fly.. So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow,. Yeah I'll see you tomorrow.. My legs are dangling off the edge,. The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,. I think I'll slit my wrists again. And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,. My legs are dangling off the edge,. A stomach full of pills didn't work again,. I'll put a bullet in my head. And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.. I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,. Like a bird so high,. Oh I might just try,. I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,. Like a bird so high,. Oh I might just try,. Oh I might just try"

C-c-cut up all the jurors to your lost soul. Think I'm 'bout to die on a dotted line. (Then it's beef, cut throats on a short lie). It ain't a fucking cry, I'm taking back what's mine. (Los Angeles, we on a front line). Click-click boom, let them fall. (Lining them up with a semi-matic auto). Hear the call, hear the call. Hop in the whip to tip it straight then I'm out though. When I do it like this. With a wiffle ball bat. Surf's up, bitches, and it's like that. Hollywood coming to attack!. [Danny]. I'm no shooting star, just a burning heart.

I'ma get it now, Armageddon now. Coked out skeletons, come back down. Break them down, gotta break them down. Broke down Ford lights, sing so loud. The greatest story ever told, the greatest love ever known. (Dead man walking) Audition for the big show. It's biblical, (social cynical). In the land of make believe the situation's critical. Sinking to the ocean lies some martyrs that are pinnacle. Yeah, I'm just a vision but my wings are fucking literal. As above (so below). You wanna go to heaven but you sold your soul. Dying young (I'm going home). Cut yourself a bunch so you don't grow old. We're living in denial. (but we're doing it in style). Out here in California, it's a trial by fire!. [Danny].

christmas in hollywood,"[chorus x2 ]. Deuce. It's christmas in hollywood. Santa's back up in the hood. So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck. It's chanukah in inglewood. The dradles spinning in the hood. So meet me by the manura lets get drunk. J-Dog and Charlie Scene. Just a little story about last christmas. About some bad kids who were full of wishes. We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin. The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin. Little timmy stole from 7-11. So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens. We drank in his room with some dude named kevin. But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents. Zack got caught with a bottle of jack. So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack. He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack. So we took the beer back and I fucked him in the ass!!!. It's charlie scene got egg nog in my flask. The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped. Like oh my god is that saint nick?. Kids give me your list like its the 25th. Been accused of being a bad kid. But I get presents as is. Cause mrs. clause just myspace'd me. I blew off a date on christmas eve.. So I don't give a fuck if your naughty or nice. You might still get a rolly (rolex) and a gang on ice. So write your list and never have no fear. Have a hollywood christmas and an undead new year!!!!. Fuck yeah!!!. Deuce. It's christmas in hollywood. Santa's back up in the hood. So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck. It's chanukah in inglewood. The dradles spinning in the hood. So meet me by the manura lets get drunk. Johnny 3 Tears and Da Kurlzz. Bout to serve it up for for all you boys and girls.. Good kids, bad and even da kurlzz.. We were chillin at home and deckin the halls.. So I checked my phone and santa had called.. He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve.. He said that his jolly ass needed some help.. He said christmas aint a gang but a way of life.. ""if you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife."". So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle,. Funnier than fuck you can ask chris kringle.. So we all took flight but something was fishy.. He asked for road head and started to kiss me.. Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows.. Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's.. I pulled down his beard and it was a monster.. It wasn't saint nick it was a fuckin imposter.. When we found out he started to pout.. I took my bandana and I choked him out.. I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth.. Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south.. I had a lot of wild nights but tonight was the craziest,. Met a lot of jeff's but this one was shadiest.. When it comes to cheer that motherfuckers a grinch.. So if you don't like christmas fuck you bitch!!!. Deuce. It's christmas in hollywood. Santa's back up in the hood. So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck. It's chanukah in inglewood. The dradles spinning in the hood. So meet me by the manura lets get drunk. Lets get drunk (x5). It's christmas in hollywood. Santa's back up in the hood. So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck.

circles,"(Tha Producer:). Take my hand lets go,. Somewhere we can rest our souls.. We'll sit where it's warm,. You say ""Look, we're here alone."". (Chorus:). I was running in circles,. I hurt myself,. Just to find my purpose.. Everything was so worthless,. I didn't deserve this,. But to me you were perfect.. I'm scattered through this life.. If this is life I'll say good bye.. She's gone like an angel,. With wings let me burn tonight.. (Chorus). (Johnny 3:). I see me writin on this paper.. Prayin for some savior.. Wishin intake her and save her.. In a world so, so godless and thoughtless,. I don't know how we wrought this,. All the love that you brought us.. It feels like I'm killin myself.. Just wheelin myself.. Just to pray for some help.. I'd give it all just to have, have your eternity.. Cause it's all that assures me.. It's worth all that hurts me.. I'd give you my heart,. And let you just hold it.. I'd give you my soul,. But I already sold it.. On that day that day,. The day I walked away in December.. I will always remember.. I'll regret it forever.. I remember brown eyes,. So sad and blue skies.. Turned to darkness and night.. I'm so sick of the fight.. I won't breathe unless you breathe,. Won't bleed unless you bleed.. Won't be unless you be,. 'Till I'm gone and I can sleep.. (Chorus). (Tha Producer:). I've gone away,. Seen better times in yesterday (I hurt myself).. It's hard to say,. That everything will be okay (I hurt myself).. I've gone away,. Seen better times in yesterday (I hurt myself).. It's hard to say,. That everything will be okay (I hurt myself)"
city,Let's watch it burn. Let's watch it burn. Let's watch this city burn the world. Let's watch this city burn. From the skylines on top of the world. 'Til there's nothing left of her. Let's watch this city burn the world. My body doused in ashes. With two empty cans of gas. The only evidence they have. Is the police sketch on my mask. And its hard at times to ask. If you can save my heart for last. And its hard to face the facts. When the darkness fades to black. It's not just make believe. When they make me take a seat. And they put amphetamines. It's in the air and make me breath. So come on and grab your children. Look out for burning buildings. And villains who pillage. They're killing by the millions. And billions of people. Die for a lost cause. So now I pray to my nation. Destroyed under God. (it's the end of the world). All my battles have been won. But the war has just begun. Let's watch this city burn. From the skylines the top of the world. Till there's nothing left in her. Let's watch the city burn the world. The city looks so pretty. Do you wanna burn it with me?. Till the skies bleed ashes. And the fuckin skyline crashes. They catch us with matches. To ignite the flame. And all the hopes of a young. Deemed fuckin insane. They say. Take the pill. In God we trust. Go and kill. God loves us. As in life as in death. Breathing till there is no breath. I will not die in the night. But in the light of the sun. And the ashes of this world in my lungs. But who am I to say. Lets all just run away. Grab your saints and pray. We're gonna burn the world today. (it's the end of the world). As in heaven as on earth. We've been dead since our birth. Let's watch this city burn. From the skylines the top of the world. Till there's nothing left of her. Let's watch the city burn the world. (Let's watch it burn)X2. The city looks so pretty. Do you wanna burn it with me?. The city looks so pretty. Do you wanna burn it with me?. The city looks so pretty. Do you wanna burn it with me?. We use the trees as torches. (Do you wanna burn it with me?). Dot the streets with corpses. (Do you wanna burn it with me?). We watch the city f**kin bleed. (Do you wanna burn it with me?). And Bring the world to its knees. (Do you wanna burn it with me?). Let's watch this city burn. From the skylines on the top of the world. Til there's nothing left of her. Let's watch this city burn the world. Let's watch this city burn. From the skylines on the top of the world. Til there's nothing left of her. Let's watch this city burn the world. Let's watch it burn. Let's watch it burn.

comin' back down,"I just can't escape. It's like you're here with me now. But the words you say. They always seem to fade out. Since you been away. I'm just a face in the crowd. Someday, someday. I know you're coming back. Down in the dirt. With your blood on my hands. I blacked out. But now i do understand. That you were too good. For this world so you left it. Everything turned red. And then you made an exit. I don't even know. If it was your time. But like all good things. That pass you by. Its like a lost soul. In the time of need. It made me grow up fast. And put some blood on my knees. And you don't even know. What's beyond you. Thinking you could never die. Like you're bullet proof. So i guess you had to leave. You were born with wings. But you were never happy. Til the angels sing. I just can't escape. It's like you're here with me now. But the words you say. They always seem to fade out. Since you been away. I'm just a face in the crowd. Someday, someday. I know you're coming back down. Someday, someday. I know you're coming back down. I'm ashes to ashes. I'm dust to dust. And when a man. Turns to ashes. Forget about love. Like the feeling inside you. With the bottle beside you. You both end up empty. Like an angel just died too. I look to the heavens. To the sky and the rest. I looked inside myself. I felt my heart in my chest. Something so point blue. There's nothing to say. Some hearts to stay true. Musicjuzz.Blogspot.Com. When falling away. Come lay down beside me. What you and i mean. It's only what i've seen. It's only just one dream. Tell my baby i love her. And i wish i could hold her. It's hard to say goodbye. When you know that it's over. I just can't escape. It's like you're here with me now. But the words you say. They always seem to fade out. Since you been away. I'm just a face in the crowd. Someday, someday. I know you're coming back down.

dark places,"Dark places, Dark places. Dark places, Dark places. Dark places, Dark places. I've come way too far for this. I've put in too much work. I've dealt with too much hurt. I worked way to hard for this. We live in dark places, dark places. People say I'm pissed off. Cause I like to shit talk. But people are fake. So wait till their jaws lock. Tick-a-ti-tick tock. The click of the wrist watch. Time is running out. On my way to the tip-top. So fuck it I can't stop. Been waiting for too long. Started my own plot. It's starting with this song. Damned if I'm damn wrong. Who wants to fight a lion?. Motherfuckers who hate. Just wait for me to die trying. Like I'm gonna stop now. Like I'm gonna cop out. Choke this motherfucker. I ain't willing to drop out. So maybe I'm pissed off because I feel ripped off. This industry is a bitch and [?] your dick on. Famous and broke and into a joke. But I've come way too far now, ain't giving a home. I can break my bag and I ain't gonna choke. Show these faggots on top that I'm climbing the rope. I've come way too far for this. I've put in too much work. I've dealt too much hurt. I worked way to hard for this. We live in dark places, dark places. When you come from nothing, you wann die for some. So I started a run and kept on going. Dark heart, dark thoughts, in a blackout room. Lockout, cadillac, click clac, go. Sang you a song, the words went right through. And I can't own a house if its haunt me too. So let's draw the line and it's me and it's you. I do it all the time and j3t don't loose. Can you write some checks that you can't cash. So I'm little bit beat up, baby keep on coming back. Yea there's just some things I can't stand. A little trigger happy so come on let's dance. Fuck you vertue, you lie and you mean it. With the writing on the wall but you just can't read it. Comes back around and you better believe it. If you got a dark heart I'm motherfucking eat it. I've come way too far for this.

With a 40 in his fist and a fifth of more rocks. Got his sleeves cut off with marijuana tube socks. Smoking pot in the drop top bumping kid rock.

Hicker-dickeri dick and dicker-dickeri dock. So talk shit and get socked. So get rocks and get lost. Or get dropped and get topped. This hip-hop shit gets hot. This is not a pit stop. And I'm not gonna stop. Until I'm on the top. Like your mom on a cock. So when you see me in your hood. Yeah you better think twice. Let me give you all a little piece of advice. If you push me any further it's the end of your life. And I'll kill you like the 60 bars I did on this mic. I've come way too far for this. I've put in too much work. I've dealt too much hurt.

I got all I need strapped right to my head stream. I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things. I'm really not a mad man, the voices keep asking. Born with a soul that don't wanna be saved. Every time I look around I see what a fiend made. Every time I die, I hope they diggin' up my grave. An undead one, like the flag that I wave. I'm not afraid to cross on this cocaine sickness. I'm not afraid to die, let the good book witness. I ask and get none, nope, no forgiveness. The day of the dead and you're on our hit list. So come all you misfits!. Bitch you're on our hit list!. Hold on, holy ghost (hold on). Go on, hold me close (go on). Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost (hold on). So long to the ones you know (so long). Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually. It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that cannot be. Lets his dagger cut jaggedly. While you're gaspin' so rapidly. While you gag on this rag. I see you all laughin' so happily. It's ok to get startled and be afraid of the dark. I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart. And I've already started, there ain't no savin' your heart. This is the day of the dead, this ain't no day in the park. Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows. And run, better run from the skull and crossbones. The song has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow. When I'm done, I ain't done, 'cause it's hell that follows. Now get ready for sorrow. 'Cause it's hell that follows. When the ashes start to rise. And the moon falls from the sky. And 1000 candles burn into the night. When the angels softly cry. On the plains below the sky. Would 1000 souls still pray for you and I?. Hold on (holy ghost). Go on (hold me close). Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead.

Every time I look around I see what a fiend made. Every time I die, I hope they're diggin' up my grave. An undead one like the flag that I wave. I'm not afraid to cross on this cocaine sickness. I'm not afraid to die, let the good book witness. An undead one like the flag that I wave. The day of the dead and you're on our hit list. So come all you misfits!. Bitch, you're on our hit list!. Chorus. Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. So long to the ones you know. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. This is exactly what has to be done. It happens so gradualy. It's like I magically happened. To be this phantom that candidly. Lets his dagger cut jaggedly. While you're gaspin' so rapidly. While you gag on this rag. I see you laughing so happly. It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark. I'll just wait here to swallow this soul and tear you apart. And I've already started, there ain't no savin' your heart. This is the day of the dead, this is no day in the park. Here I come, here I come, down your guns and crossbows. And run, better run from the skull and crossbones. The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow. When I'm done, I ain't done, 'cause it's hell that follows. Now get ready for sorrow. 'cause it's hell that follows. Chorus. Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. So long to the ones you know. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. When the ashes start to rise. And the moon falls from the sky. And thousand candles burn into the night. When the angels softly cry. On the plains below the sky. Will thousand souls still pray for you and I?. Chorus. Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. Go on, hold me close. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. So long to the ones you know. Better run, here we come. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead. Hold on, holy ghost. It's the day of the dead"

So come together, come together again. The time is now let the armageddon begin. They say beginnings always starts with the ends. I say forever and forever amen. Forget what you are. Forget what you feel. Stand apart but fall together. Nothing ever lasts forever. We're born to live. We're born to die. We're forced to swallow these pills. And to never ask why. What I've become?. What can you see?. That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease. Everybody's got this disease. Feeling my pain. Hang in the gallows. Cast the rain. Feeling so hollow. Run into shame. Deep in the shallow. Not the same but feeling so hollow. I crashed the train just to start a revolution. I'm not insane I just want to be free. It's not the same if it's our execution. Let them all see you're undead just like me. So I'm to blame, the one to follow. Give it away, got nothing to follow. Fuck the fame, fuck the sorrow. Live with the day and never tomorrow. Forget what you are. Forget what you feel. Stand apart but fall together. Nothing ever lasts forever. We're born to live. We're born to die. We're forced to swallow these pills. And to never ask why. What I've become?. What can you see?. That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease. Everybody's got this disease. Everybody's got this disease. I tried to believe, on my knees it's so hard. And they pick and they pull and they tear you apart. But they won't let me go. No they won't let me go. And I'm dying baby, dying baby. Dying so slow. Walk in the world, it's so empty and dull. In the land of the beautiful, beauty is cold. They won't let me go. No they won't let me go. And I'm dying baby, dying baby. Dying alone. We're born to live. We're born to die. We're forced to swallow these pills. And to never ask why. What I've become?. What can you see?. That everybody, everybody, everybody's got this disease. Everybody's got this disease. Everybody's got this disease. Everybody's got this disease. Everybody's got this disease"
does everybody in the world have to die,"Change, some broken fate. Dim fucking dreams of a Hollywood cage. Perfect, pitch-perfect babe. Kingdom may come, but look what we made. Slaughter and fuck what comes after. The meaningless madness, maniacal laughter. And what else can you take?. Your hands put together, so holy, you hate. Another fucking madman. Another motherfucker with a motherfucking handgun. Come all you weak, come all you wicked. I got some heart but we get it, bitches. Does everybody in the world have to fucking die?. Does everybody in the world have to fucking die?. Does everybody in the world have to fucking die?. Everybody in the world has to fucking die. I am a thief and my father is a bastard. Who am I? I am you. My ego it eats and it needs an answer. Do or die, let the hate burn through. Take a deep breath as you look in my soul. I devour your dreams and I live in your home. It comes from under the bed. The foul smell and hot breath. A need in your head. A close relative of death. We're coming inside. Kill the fucking hunter and you're killing the pride. In the tide, I'll survive. But will the fucking world leave me buried alive?. Does everybody in the world have to fucking die?. Does everybody in the world have to fucking die?. Does everybody in the world have to fucking die?. Everybody in the world has to fucking die. Die!. You will not be anything. An after-thought, a memory. You'll cut bullets when you leave. You have nightmares, I have dreams. We need Mother Marry White. Hold in breath and wait to die. Just another shallow man. Zipped up in a body bag. Just another shallow man. Zipped up in a body bag. Just another shallow man. Zipped up in a body bag. Just another shallow man. Zipped up in a body bag. Just another shallow man. Zipped up in a body bag"

I wanna take you home. but your friends won't let ya'. I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta. Buy beer. Or pay the rent. My signing bonus was quickly spent. So I'll beat my meat. like I'm a fuckin' butcher. And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher!. (Chorus x2). (Verse 3)(Charlie Scene). Let's get this party jumpin'. Let's see some 40 chuggin'. I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick. when I start buzzin'. Come on girls I wanna see you drinkin'. I wanna see your brain start shrinkin'. Make a move I saw you winkin'. Drunken pussies what I'm thinkin'. I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not. Turn it up loud feel the ambiance. Grab 2 ho's and do some body shots. I wanna party all night until they call the cops. Fuck a wristband lets all do a keg stand. I'm like Cheech with out the Chong. Hittin up the beer bong. When the cops show up. Their gonna get the finger. And I don't give a fuck. Cuz I'm the designated drinker!. (Chorus x4). Everywhere I Go,. Bitches always know. That Charlie Scene. has got a weenie that he loves to show(bitch). Everywhere I Go, Bitches always know. That Charlie Scene. has got a weenie that he loves to show"
from the ground,"I can't see. because I'm staring at a blank wall (blank wall). I can't breathe because my fucking thoughts are choking me now. I can't grieve for the souls that are so lost (are so lost). I can't leave because my fucking self is holding me down. Imagine cold hands up to your throat. The thought alone makes you swallow your hope. And now it's harder to cope. And I don't know where I'll go. These fallacies I don't believe,. and fear that nobody knows. It's a red night and I don't see any light. And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die. As I look up from the ground. I see darkness all around. And I'm lost. but can be found inside my mind. Goodbye. As I look up from the ground. I see darkness all around. And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky. Goodbye. Look as we all fall apart. We all fall apart. We all fall apart. Would you forgive me if I told you. That I lied like you (fuck you). So full of hate with the love to lose. Would you deny it if I asked you. Just to tell the truth. Cause in the end. You gotta decide what side to choose. Imagine cold hands holding your heart. The thought alone can tear you apart. I know you wish it would end,. it's sad it's only the start. These memories they only mean. My soul is empty and dark. It's a red night and I don't see any light. And then a flat line, I'm fucking ready to die. As I look up from the ground. I see darkness all around. And I'm lost. but can be found inside my mind. Goodbye. As I look up from the ground. I see darkness all around. And I'm lost but can be found up in the sky. Goodbye. It's a red night and I don't see any light. And then a flat line,. I'm fucking ready to die. It's a red night, if it's wrong or it's right. And if I don't fight it's like being buried alive (x2). . Cause I, I wanna feel anything. And I know that we all think. We can't be wrong. Soon we all be gone. And I, I don't know what this means. But if I knew anything. I'd know for sure. We'll all be gone. As I look up from the ground. I see darkness all around. And I'm lost. but can be found inside my mind. Goodbye. As I look up from the ground. I see darkness all around. And I'm lost. but can be found up in the sky. Goodbye"
fuck the world,"I wanna fuck the world. I'm gonna make it hurt. I'll stand here all alone. I'm gonna watch it burn. I wanna fuck the world. I'm gonna make it hurt. I'll stand here all alone. I'm gonna watch it burn. I just wanna bleach you. And I just wanna eat you. And tear your soul out. Until I fucking defeat you. The end is just a preview. 'Cause you to me you're see-through. You're choking on the ash. Unless you can't continue. What if I told you that we're already dead?. What if I said you can't outrun this spread?. I got one foot forward as I'm moving ahead. So just open up your arms and drink the dread. Embrace the kiss of death. While you're holding on your chest. And you're burning from the bullets. That you're gasping for breath. Unless you join us in the fight. With the dove on your cress. Then we will march into the night. We're the few, we're the blessed. I was an outcast. I'm heaven's mistake. So now I'm standing at the foot. Of the fiery gates. And I turned the invitation. So I'm already late. But I wanna watch it burn. So the devil can wait. I wanna fuck the world. I'm gonna make it hurt. I'll stand here all alone. I'm gonna watch it burn. I wanna fuck the world. I'm gonna make it hurt. I'll stand here all alone. I'm gonna watch it burn. Look at what you made. An ugly world of pretty grade. And you're praying now, baby. But you prayed a little late. I was born to burn it down. Not for heaven, heaven's fake. I was made to burn it down. So I can make you feel the same. Yeah, you better write those letters. That you're never gonna send. I can see through the tears. But all I see is red. I see all the pain. And you say ""what's the problem? "". ""What happened to these kids? "". ""When was it that we lost them? "". Lost inside the time. They were victims by design. And sedated till they demonstrated. How you live and how you die. I only wanna burn the world. And now you're asking why. Well, count your blessings, say your prayers. It's time to say goodbye. We're gone, gone like a nightmare in a dark place. All along, fatality that I made. Gone, gone like a nightmare in a dark place. All along, all along everything they love is gone. I wanna fuck the world. I'm gonna make it hurt. I'll stand here all alone. I'm gonna watch it burn. I wanna fuck the world. I'm gonna make it hurt. I'll stand here all alone. I'm gonna watch it burn. I just wanna bleach you. And I just wanna eat you. And tear your soul out. Until I fucking defeat you. I just wanna bleach you. And I just wanna eat you. And tear your soul out. Until I fucking defeat you. I wanna fuck the world. I'm gonna watch it burn. I wanna fuck the world"

gotta let go,"I just wanna life that seems. A little better than a dream. But I just can't seem. To get on my feet. So I gotta let go. Gotta let go. Gotta let go.

Never realized nobody could save him. So all these words. For what they're worth. I know it's hard. I know it hurts. And we laugh at the past. Cause it's how we learn.

I know that I'll never reach perfection. At least he could point me in the right direction. Some grow old, and some grow cold. They'd sell their souls for a heart of gold.

hear me now,"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,. I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out my chest.. I keep searching for something that I never seem to find.. But maybe I wonâ€™t, because I left it all behind.. Now Iâ€™m stuck with this, and thatâ€™ll never change. Always a part of me, until the very last day.. Where to go from here? What road to travel on?. I spent my whole life choosing, and I always chose wrong.. Will I try to have the will to be alive?. Will I try because Iâ€™ve never seen the light?. Blow it to the ground and itâ€™s now you see,. You spent your whole life taking the best of me. Whereâ€™d you go? Whereâ€™s your home?. Howâ€™d you end up all alone?. Can you hear me now?. Thereâ€™s no light, thereâ€™s no sound.. Hard to breathe, when youâ€™re underground.. Can you hear me now? Hear me now. How low can I keep pretending to be?. That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me.. Heaven will open up if I live on my knees.. A man of many words, but a man of few deeds.. Walking these streets, so absent of hope.. A pillow of concrete, a man with no home.. Lend him a hand, then weâ€™re walking the way.. Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame.. So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight.. When you wake up, you know itâ€™s darker than last night.. Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by.. Born to walk away, been walking my whole life.. Whereâ€™d you go? Whereâ€™s your home?. Howâ€™d you end up all alone?. Can you hear me now?. Thereâ€™s no light, thereâ€™s no sound.. Hard to breathe, when youâ€™re underground.. Can you hear me now? Hear me now. Look into my eyes and I see. What do I see? Nothing at all. Take another look around me. What do I see? Nothing at all. Whereâ€™d you go? Whereâ€™s your home?. Howâ€™d you end up all alone?. Can you hear me now?. Thereâ€™s no light, thereâ€™s no sound.. Hard to breathe, when youâ€™re underground.. Can you hear me now? Hear me now. Can you hear me? Hear me now"

I keep askin the question can I be saved by confession. You see this blood on my hands at least I still reach into heaven. I got to pick up the pieces I gotta burry 'em deep. And when you look in my eyes I'll be the last thing you'll see. [Danny]. I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to. I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die.

I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to. [Johnny 3 Tears]. Words turn into blood and the blood keeps on pourin'. From every poor I whipe it off cuz this just could be the moment. Now someones gotta die and I'm my only aponant. Cuz I will watch my baby cry so I keep on just goin'. Am I a man or a beast it's mother nature at least. Watch humanity cease cuz it's our human disease. You gotta kill when you gotta kill yeah that's what they say. And I can't go against God's will you better pray. Cuz I'm an angel a demon yeah I'm hell and I'm heaven. I'm everything you couldn't be now you believe in the devil. I gotta pick up the pieces I gotta bury them deep. And when the dirt hits the coffin just go to sleep. [Danny]. I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to. I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die. No, I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to. Blood is getting hotter, body's getting colder. I told you once I'm the only one who holds her. I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.... [Danny]. Now that I see. I see you buried. Six feet below. [Johnny 3 Tears]. Another life goes into the knife. I couldn't let 'em breath cuz I didn't wanna die. [Danny]. Now that I see. I see you buried. Six feet below. [Johnny 3 Tears]. It's not alright can you hear me as I cry. I couldn't let you live cuz I didn't wanna die. [Danny].

i must be emo,"Dear Diary, Mood: Apathetic. My life is spiraling downward. I couldnâ€™t get enough money to go to the Blood Red romance and suffocate me dry concert. It sucks because they play some of my favorite songs like, Stab My Heart because I Love You and Rip Apart My Soul and of course Stabby, Rip, Stab, Stab. And it doesnâ€™t help that I couldnâ€™t get my hair to flippy thing either, like that guy from that band could do. Somedays.. Iâ€™m an emo kid, non-confroming as can be youâ€™d be non-conforming to if you looked just like me. I have paint on my nails and makeup on my face. Iâ€™m almost emo enough to start shaving my legs, cause I feel real deep when Iâ€™m dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag. Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dikes. Cause emo is one step below tranvestite. Stop my breathing and slit my throat. I must be emo. I donâ€™t jump around when I go to shows. I must be emo. Iâ€™m dark, and sensitive with low self esteem. The way I dress makes everyday feel like Halloween. I have no real problems but I like to make believe. I stole my sisters mascara and now Iâ€™m grounded for a week. Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies. I canâ€™t get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing. Girls keep breaking up with me. Itâ€™s never any fun they say they already have a pussy. They donâ€™t need another one. Stop my breathing and slit my throat. I must be emo. I donâ€™t jump around when I go to shows. I must be emo. Dye in my hair nail polish on my toes. I must be emo. I play guitar and write suicide notes. I must be emo. My life is just a black abyss. You know? Itâ€™s so dark. And its suffocating me. Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip. Tighter than a pair of my little sisters jeans.. Which look great on me, by the way. When I get depressed I cut my wrists in every direction. Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection. I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses. I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes. Iâ€™m just a bad, cheap, imitation of goth. You could read me Catcher In The Rye and watch me jack-off. I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life. If I said I like girls Iâ€™d only be half right. I look like Iâ€™m dead and dress like a homo. I must be emo. Screw XBOX I play old school Nintendo. I must be emo. I like to whine and hit my parentals. I must be emo. Me and my friends all look like clones. I must be emo. My parents donâ€™t get me , you know?. They think Iâ€™m gay because they saw me kiss a guy ,well, a couple of guys. But I mean, it's the 2000's, canâ€™t two, or four dudes make out with each other without being gay?. I mean chicks dig that kind of thing anyways. I donâ€™t know diary, sometimes I think youâ€™re the only one on that gets me, Youâ€™re my best friend"
i'll be there,"Can you see me my love?. What there above when you were dying. I was dying too, look for meaning and song. But the meaning is gone cause I was crying. Right alone with you if the heavens may break. I hope for our take and if they ever do. I'll be there with you. I woke up feeling the same way that I did yesterday. Don't know what these tears will say. But I miss my friend, I ran away. I watch the seasons as they go. The rain, the sun, the heat, the snow. I don't know much but this I know. I miss my friend I miss him so. I say my prayers, I raise my hands. I move my feet and when I can. I said help, would you help me now?. And lift me up when my legs give out?. I know that life is short and living is the hardest part. Someplace through the dark. We will meet and never part. Someplace through the dark. Can you see me my love?. What there above when you were dying. I was dying too, look for meaning and song. But the meaning was gone cause I was crying. Right alone with you if the heavens may break. I hope for a take and if they ever do. I'll be there with you. The calms before the break. The sun descents like yesterday. The good may come and go away. And bad news wait for you to wake. We all kneel down before the storm. When weights come scratching at your door. I've been down but down before. I have faith but I need more. Respects does care in our world. Nothingless behind the curtain. Life is short but death is certain. That will always be our burden. Free. Afraid to follow if I promise you tomorow. See through the dark. We will meet and never part. Someplace through the dark. Can you see me my love?. What there above when you were dying. I was dying too, look for meaning and song. But the meaning is gone cause I was crying. Right alone with you if the heavens may break. I hope for a take and if they ever do. I'll be there with you. I had something to say but the words went away. Just like they always do. I will be there with you. Can you see me my love?. What there above when you were dying. I was dying too, look for meaning and song. But the meaning was gone cause I was crying. Right alone with you if the heavens may break. I hope for a take and if they ever do. I'll be there with you"
immigrant song,"Ah, ah,. We come from the land of the ice and snow,. From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.. Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new land,. To fight the horde, sing and cry: Valhalla, I am coming!. On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore.. Ah, ah,. We come from the land of the ice and snow,. From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.. How soft your fields so green, can whisper tales of gore,. Of how we calmed the tides of war. We are young overlords.. On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore.. So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,. For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing."

mother murder,"There's blood on my hands! (hands). There's blood on my hands! (hands). There's blood on my hands! (hands). There's blood on my hands!. On my hands, on my hands!. Wake up in the middle of ascending in the night. With some tears on my pillow. And this blood on my knife.. And my soul has stained the sheets. But they're pulled off to the side.. Who's blood could this be?. Is it yours or is it mine?. Take the knife and twist it.. Where's my heart you missed it.. You know I don't wanna die. But baby you insist it.. Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have.. My heart just keeps on beating. And it's more than you can stand.. Baby, please just tell me. How we ever went so wrong.. We use to sing together. When we used to sing a song.. We can never sing forever. Cause now my voice is gone.. Guess I'm gone forever and you knew it all along.. I can see blood all over my hands.. The longer you lay next to me. The further I ran.. What's it all worth?. How much can you stand?. The longer you stay close to me. The further I ran.. There's blood on my hands! (hands). There's blood on my hands! (hands). There's blood on my hands! (hands). There's blood on my hands!. I'm only evil when I need to be. But you did this so easily.. I try to treat you equally. And listen to your reasoning.. But you waited so eagerly. While plotting and deceiving me.. You came behind me secretly. And shattered every piece of me.. I have nothing to give, so I gave you my life!. Didn't want to see me live, so you gave me your knife.. Didn't hear you as you tiptoed. Coming from behind.. You took away my kids. So I guess you killed me twice.. Drag me into the night. Cause it's the one thing you keep.. You knew that I had to die. So you could finally sleep.. This blood all over your knife. You know you earned yourself.. And it's a matter of time until you burn in hell.. I can see blood all over my hands.. The longer you lay next to me. The further I ran.. What's it all worth?. How much can you stand?. The longer you stay close to me. The further I ran.. There's blood on my hands!. No remorse holds no recourse. Now I'm leaving slowly. Oh won't you hold me. No remorse holds no recourse. Now I'm leaving slowly. Oh won't you hold me. I can see blood all over my hands.. The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran.. What's it all worth? How much can you stand?. The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran.. I can see blood all over my hands.. The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran.. What's it all worth? How much can you stand?. The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran.. There's blood on my hands! (hands). There's blood on my hands! (hands). There's blood on my hands! (hands).

new day,"[Johnny 3 Tears]. So anybody froze in the alley of scars. Mama what you think? He wasn't swimming with sharks. You think I'm evil now keep them kids in the dark. I got a gallon of a gasoline and a chest full of hearts. So you hide behind the papers and the records that made me. Immunization, on papers I'm 18. Selling some rights for this Johnny come lately. Like fate in some bars, you think it fucking gonna change me. From the bottom of bottles and it's right back to the top. It's a space in between where I keep getting caught. Yeah, I listen to these demons way more often than not. So I'll just keep on singing 'cause I don't wanna talk. [Danny]. 'Cause I know, I know I'm not right. But I've got my whole life. And that's alright with me. It's a new day, a new day. You have loved yourself and no one else. In a new day, a new day. It's a broken life what's left inside?. It's a new day, a new day. You have loved yourself and no one else. It's a new day, how do we change?. With a broken life what's left inside?. [J-Dog]. Today is my dream but tomorrow I choose. To stay awake and unseen, or sleep in oceans of blue. It's true the devil in me it's like speech you the freak. They say my tongue turns black everytime that I breathe. Pretend I'm just a thief, I'm not allowed to preach. But you can hear my words as they bleed through the streets. To under achieve has never been a disease. You know, we can burn the earth with kerosene and a dream. The lynch of the mob and the powers that beat. They see me as a threat to the sheep, I'm looking for meat. I can see the light and feel the beat of the drums. I ain't finished yet, I wanna cry when they come. [Danny]. 'Cause I know, I know I'm not right. But I've got my whole life. And that's alright with me. It's a new day, a new day. You have loved yourself and no one else. In a new day, a new day. It's a broken life what's left inside?. It's a new day, a new day. You have loved yourself and no one else. It's a new day, how do we change?. With a broken life what's left inside?. So where do we go when there's nowhere left to crawl?. And what do we do when we thought we knew it all?. Now we're surrounded by a world of lonely people. Am I the last one here, or the last one left to fall?. [Danny]. It's a new day, a new day. You have loved yourself and no one else. In a new day, a new day. It's a broken life what's left inside?. It's a new day, a new day. You have loved yourself and no one else. It's a new day, how do we change?. With a broken life what's left inside?"

outside,[Danny]. Someone left the door open. Who left me outside. I'm bent I'm not broken. Come live in my life. All the words left unspoken. All the pages I write. On my knees and I'm hoping. That someones holds me tonight. Hold me tonight. [Johnny 3 Tears]. Welcome to the world. Ya know the landing it was wasted. The blood upon your hands. And the wickedness that made it. Seem to scream it all. And the memories get faded. See the exit wound. And God would have me take it. I guess I'll say a prayer. And I'll kiss into the air. I look up to the sky. Send them straight to nowhere. We all dug the grave. Can't shake away the shame. Can't quiver in the sky. But your shaking all the same. You left us with the guns. And all of 'em were unloaded. Teach us how to shoot. But you taught us how to hold them. All the weight of the world. Is right between your shoulders. Heavy is the heart. When the world keeps growing colder. [Danny]. Who left the door open?. Who left me outside?. I'm on my knees and I'm hoping. That someones holds me tonight. Hold me tonight. [Johnny 3 Tears]. Two sides to every story. Here's a little morning glory. Breakfast of a mirror dying slow. Seems a little boring. Burn it like a flag. Walk it straight into the breeze. Cause there's two types of people. You are weak or you are me. Yeah what's another life time. Like mine. We all die sometimes. It's alright. If you've come to say your goodbyes. To this life. We all hurt a little sometimes. We're alright. So mothers hold your children. Don't you ever let 'em go. There is weakness in your grip. And they are holding all you hope. Don't you ever let me go. (Don't you ever let me go). Don't you ever let me go. (Don't you ever let me go). [Danny]. Who left the door open?. Who left me outside?. I'm on my knees and I'm hoping. That someones holds me tonight. Hold me tonight. Someone left the door open. Who left me outside. I'm bent I'm not broken. Come live in my life. All the words left unspoken. All the pages I write. On my knees and I'm hoping. That someones holds me tonight. Hold me tonight

My god I keep bleedin. I watch the world die through crimson eyes. I cry, it hurts tonight. I die, I see the light. And now I'll say goodbye. Now I can see your pain I'm sorry. (Goodbye). I cry so hard. Now I can see your pain I'm sorry. (Goodbye). I cry tonight. If I could take all this pain away. Use the rage of our youth today. Whose to say that it's you to blame. It's the people above you. The ones who say that they love you. Look what the world has come to. So now it's time to say ""Fuck you"". You think you can and they drug you. When no one is staring when they numb you. Fill you with terror and crush you. But do they care as they shove you. So you look to me to find the truth. And what I say is what you do. But everyone you look up to. Is really as fucked up as you. Time is getting shorter. With these enforcer's orders. And we get blamed and pushed around. So Whose the fucking villian now?. Now I can see your pain I'm sorry. (Goodbye). I cry so hard. Now I can see your pain I'm sorry. (Goodbye). I cry tonight. We can't stop now. Were so close now. Cause these times are almost over. I wont give up. So god save us. It feels like were getting closer. We can't stop now. Were so close now. Cause these times are almost over. I wont give up. So god save us. Now I can see your pain I'm sorry. (Goodbye). I cry so hard. Now I can see your pain I'm sorry. (Goodbye). I cry tonight. (Goodbye). I cry tonight. I cry tonight"
paradise lost,"So watch my chest heave. As this last breath leaves me. I am trying to be. What you're dying to see. Feel like, ""fuck, man,. can't take this anymore,. this heart, break this"". It's life that's so thankless. How could he just forsake us?. Racist he makes us. Hate us, he gave us. Nothing but no trust. And I am so fucked up. So let this gun bond us. Let's hide by this lust. And once we are just dust. He'll know that he loved us!. Let it all burn!. I will burn first. God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?. Just let me burn, it's what I deserve. God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?. So take me and make me. Weaken and save me. This hate that you gave me. Keeps saying the same thing. ""To sing when you're hurt. And to sing when you cry. To sing when you live. And to sing when you die"". And here at the end. At the end of the hurt. All the pain ain't the same. When it's your turn to burn. We're the heart for the heartless. The thoughts for the thoughtless. The lies for the honest. Why is this God so damn godless?. Let it all burn. I will burn first. God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?. Just let me burn. It's what I deserve. God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?. So cry three tears for me. Deuce and Johnny 3 Tears: When it's all gone. Sing me this song. So cry three tears for me. When it's all gone. When it's all gone!. I cannot stand who I am. I'm this man. With this blood on my hands. In this blood, I am damned. So watch my wings burn. As they burn in the fire. Don't scatter the ashes. No need for the choir. Let it all burn. I will burn first. God, I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?. Just let me burn. It's what I deserve. God, I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?. This hate that you gave me keeps saying. Just let me burn. Just let me burn. This hate that you gave me keeps saying. Just let me burn. Just let me burn. Burn!. Now!. Burn!. Just let me burn!. Now!. Burn!. Burn!"

From this weed I'm having; where's my keys, goddamnit?. I should be on half of me and three's on taxing. On my knees, I'm blacking out, I need some action. Like a peon tapping from this seed I'm packaging. Your knees are shagging, let me see what happens. Your cheeks are clapping, charles p. Is rapping. Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer.

So pour me, pour me, pour me another.. I wake up right about the mid-afternoon,. With the sun in the sky but nights coming soon,. I walk to the mirror just to fix myself,. Yeah life gets harder when you love nothing else,. So I pick my pills from the counter drawer,. Pick my self-esteem up off the fucking floor,. I guess I'm a man of no recourse,. As I crack another bottle, got no remorse,. And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me,. I swear I used to be what I truly believe,. That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,. Even I could go to heaven,. If I'm part deceased,. So.... Pour me, pour me, pour me another,. It haunts me, haunts me,. Like no other,. One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,.

At the bottom, they got just, yeah, just what you need,. Well at the bottom, you can't swim 'cause you drank up the sea,. Then we stop and we look up to the sky,. They don't ask any questions, they ask us why?. Don't have any answers, don't know what to say,. Our knees are getting tired,. Too tired to pray,. That's when we laid down the end of the road,.

rain,"(Danny). I don't mind, no I don't mind, I don't mind the rain. Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same. I don't mind, that I don't mind, no I don't mind the rain. Like a widow's heart, we fall apart and never fade away. (fade away). (Johnny 3 Tears). Run like a child do you know where I came from?. No I don't, but I'm singing all the same songs. I'm alone, and you're looking for your anyone. Does it hurt just to know that it's all gone?. I can feel the pain in the words that you say. Hidden in the letters that were written to no name. Let me be the hands that you hold to your face. Cause' I'd give it all up if I could take it away. Buried in red, white, and a side of some blue. Some will die too late, and somebody too soon. If he could come back, we'll see what it cost him. We had to lose it all, just to know that we lost one. Hi, I'm just a shape in the shadow of grates. Hi, I'm just a voice in the choir of saints. Oh all the souls that nobody could save. And just like a light, we faded away. (Danny). I don't mind, no I don't mind, I don't mind the rain. Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same. I don't mind, that I don't mind, no I don't mind the rain. Like a widow's heart, we fall apart and never fade away. (fade away). Fade away, as I fade away, away, away. (Charlie Scene). If I could take it all back. Before the flags were forces to wave at half mast. That was long before my heart became black. There's no way to make it change or go black. You know that some of us grow old, no home. Some of us die in a cold house, no hope. Still surrounded by the people you don't know, so don't go. Cause it's over the time fades your photo. How many goodbyes can fit in a lifetime?. How many good lies can make it seem alright?. What do you see when you look into my eyes?. Or in the sky right before you say goodnight?. I could be the son that stands beside of your bed. And I could be the voice right inside of your head. I could say goodbye and you know where I went. I just wrote a letter that'll never be sent. (Danny). I don't mind, no I don't mind, I don't mind the rain. Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same. I don't mind, that I don't mind, no I don't mind the rain. Like a widow's heart, we fall apart and never fade away. (fade away). Fade away, as I fade away, away, away. As I fade away, away, away. As I fade away, away, away. As I fade away"
s.c.a.v.a,"When the end is getting closer. And the earth has burned the sky. Now repent 'cause it's all over. Just let me die. Here's the massacre. A mausoleum fit for me. Lived a hundred years,. A hundred years i didn't see. Gave all my hope away. Is there any left for me?. Bombs are splitting atoms. What can the future bring?. We can fill a million choirs. And wait till children sing. We can walk a million miles. And end up in the sea. And our lungs just keep filling. And lying when we breathe. The world's filled with liars. Liars like me. And i look at my child. It's fire, this feeling. It's blue like the sky. I see all of this meaning. I reach up to god and ask if i'm dreaming. I'm so sorry i don't have those things that you're needing. And darling, a kiss. Kiss me on these lips. When the end is getting closer. And the earth has burned the sky. Now repent 'cause it's all over. Just let me die. As my body lies here broken. And i'm carried to the light. Now my heart is finally open. Just let me die. Everybody says greetings and goodbyes. Everybody pays, no one knows the price. We know the price of sin. The sin of sacrifice. I know i'll sing again. But who can save me twice?. How much can we ask?. You'll get the answer first. How much can we kneel?. With the air that chills the earth?. The air keeps getting colder. My knees keep hitting dirt. The end, sink and crawl. Without the guilt of getting hurt. You ask who you love and you don't know. Do you?. The spirit of god, just passes right through you. You gave away heaven, handed right to you. And i can see it all. Tell me, is it true?. Kiss me, my darling. (darling, But I need you). Where do we go?. We go, oh. Lord, I don't know. Where we go. We go, no. I don't know where. Where do we go?. We go, oh. Lord, I don't know. Where we go. We go, no. Lord, I don't know!. When the end is getting closer. And the earth has burned the sky. Now repent 'cause it's all over. Just let me die. As my body lies here broken. And I'm carried to the light. Now my heart is finally open. Just let me die"

But here I go. Here I go. Love's a drug, I'm an addict. Ditch my heart just to kick the habit. People might think I'm problematic. Fuck it I'm alone in a world of static. Tragic but I stand alone with an empty chest it's a dial tone. And I must confess so pick up the phone. And If there's nothing left, then I'm leaving home. Living in the shadow of someone else. Till I took a deep breath and I found myself. Heard the bang from the ricochet. Maybe I was born just a castaway. I'll stay away from. This pain I came from. Can't run away from. What's been said and done. With all these days gone. Been fighting so long. I can't break away from it all. Don't even try to save me tonight. Don't even try to save me tonight. Don't even try to save me tonight. Cause I don't know. No I don't know. But here I go. Here I go. Here I go. But here I go. Here I go. So easy to hate with no one to love. It's hard to dream what I'm thinking of. So hard to watch when I'm starting to run. And now it's all over, overdone. I'm just a victim with this, sickness within. I'm just a memory faded slowly and only the lonely know me. Stand on top building so, starting down now with the world below. Half way to heaven with no where to go. Can anybody out there help me? No. I'll stay away from. This pain I came from. Can't run away from. What's been said and done. With all these days gone. Been fighting so long. I can't break away from it all. Don't even try to save me tonight. Don't even try to save me tonight. Don't even try to save me tonight. Cause I don't know No I don't know. Don't even try to save me tonight. Don't even try to save me tonight. Don't even try to save me tonight. Cause I don't know. No I don't know. But here I go. All those times without you, out you. But here I go.

Like the bottom of the dream. I was running for the sky and forgot the in between. So hard to understand that there's meaning in the man. And its lost inside the love that I guess I never had. But were all a simple chance. Holding all the gentle hands. Were as simple as a symbol. And were slipping to the past. Before I ever let go. The things are getting bad. So my daughter has a little hope. That's the meaning of a memory. That there were better things. Better dreams and a better me. Sing sing sing just a little bit more more.

street dreams,"[J-Dog]. Dead of the night we go into the world unknown. Just let us go. I Know that I'm breathin slow, inhaling smoke I just awoke. A Bottle Of pills I'm chokin down with dancing demons all around. But I'm hearin sounds, and I know I'm hearin voices now. With all the buildings crashing down, it's Armageddon again. I'll drink the poison from the crown and make a toast to the end. For all the kids and all the ones and even some. Who have just begun to feel the pain. Cause they can't stand to stay awake. [Danny]. I See the streets burn every time I fall asleep. I'm losin' all my sanity. I can't hide from the voice. That speaks inside of me. [Charlie Scene]. I saw you walk into a room. I saw a face I thought I knew. And all along it was true, it was me. It wasn't You. I asked myself if it's the truth, A guilty conscience isn't proof. A finger print well what's that do. Cause gasoline can burn that too. So hide your knives and save yourself. It's just you there's no one else. Will I change, the time will tell. I can not dream what is this HELL. So maybe I should stop this time, And draw the line. And see the light. But it's too late I can't this time. I lost my mind so save the night. [Danny]. I See the streets burn every time I fall asleep. I'm losin' all my sanity. I can't hide from the voice. That speaks inside of me. I See the streets burn along with all my memories. I'm losin' all my sanity. I can't hide from the voice. That speaks inside of me. If I lay my head down would you admire. The way I can close my eyes. Tonight and burn my conscience for the choir. [Johnny 3 Tears]. Who's to judge. Who's insane. Watch it all wash away. Save us from what we've made. It doesn't die it only fades. If can't feel there isn't pain. Another day it's all the same. I always pray I never change. It seems to me we 're all to blame. Push your matches, no more rain. Burn This Fucking World Today. [Danny]. I See the streets burn every time I fall asleep. I'm losin' all my sanity. I can't hide from the voice. That speaks inside of me. I See the streets burn along with all my memories. I'm losin' all my sanity. I can't hide from the voice. That speaks inside of me"
take me home,"I don't believe in all your demons anymore. It's hard to see with any reason from before. I lie awake and face these shadows in the night. I see the truth through crimson eyes. Take me home where the restless go. Reckless to the day I rest my bones. There's no use trying to save my soul. There's no use trying to save my soul. Take me home where the restless go. Reckless till the day I rest my bones. There's no use trying to save my soul. There's no use trying to save my soul. Whoa. Whoa. There's no use trying to save my soul. These angels burn with an internal sympathy. Don't say a word until you've heard their symphony. I lie awake creating shadows in the night. I see the truth from crimson eyes. Take me home where the restless go. Reckless till the day I rest my bones. There's no use trying to save my soul. There's no use trying to save my soul. Whoa. Whoa. There's no use trying to save my soul. Got my cards lined up in a row. Up in flames away we go. Lost my name but it's etched in stone. Take me home when the cold wind blows. Ain't no grave gonna hold me down. Wide awake so don't make a sound. Ain't no way you can break me down. No one sings, no escaping now. Take me home where the restless go. Reckless till the day I rest my bones. There's no use trying to save my soul. There's no use trying to save my soul. Whoa. Whoa. There's no use trying to save my soul. Take me home where the restless go. Reckless till the day I rest my bones. There's no use trying to save my soul. There's no use trying to save my soul. Whoa. Whoa.

the diary,"(chorus). Cus I don't wanna be like this. I've been runnin these streets. For too long now. I've got nothing thats true. But this song now. But the further I go. I wanna go home. (j3t). I fuckin' swear that I care. But its hard when you stare. Into the bottom of a bottle. That is empty and bare. All my desolate soul. In my desolate home. It's my desolate role. Yeah I'm here all alone. I can't think of a reason. To get the fuck out of bed. Curtains closed, lights are off. Am I alive or dead?. I haven't shaved in a week. I always slur when I speak. Tolerance at its peak. Another fit just to sleep. Oh woe is me woe is me. I guess I need love. Hoes ya see hoes ya see. I'm just in a rut. And I swear I'm tryin baby please. Baby don't leave. God-damn I'm a fuck-up. But I guess that's just me. So I sit in my room. And I'll cry in my bed. Thinkin about all the shit. That made me wrong in my head. I keep tryin to climb. But it seems so steep. Pour myself a fuckin' whisky. And go back to sleep... bitch. I watch my momma cry. She says 'baby why? '. I say 'baby died. Baby's gone like a suicide'. I don't think you'll see him soon, mom. Stay out my room, mom. Tell daddy that I hate. That motherfucker like you, mom. I sing this shit for you, danny, sasha and jordan. These tears keep gettin warmer. Everytime that I hold her. I pour this out for you. Like a partner in crime. It's part of the times. When you're sick in the mind. Yeah I'm sick, oh so sick. I'm so sick of this shit. Yeah I'm lit, oh so lit. I'm so fucked up off it. So I stumble around. Til I stumble fall down. To this puddle of my tears. Layin here on the ground. When you've got nothing left. You've got nothing left to lose. With my last left single breath. I'll still be singing to you. So when you bury me man. You better bury me deep. And sing along to this song. Because you're broken like me. And I wanna go back to the start. Back where we started from. And I know it's been so long. I was wrong, I was wrong. I was wrong all along"

the natives,"Seems like everyones got there beef. But tomorrow well be shining brighter. Well keep it going fighting. Hold on when we win take a hit. Cause were never gonna loose it dying. Were gonna keep on fighting. And all the days come back to me. Come back to what we used to be. And in the end well find the rest. The rest has gone away. And yesterday we used to say. We never change and stay the same. And in the end well find the rest. The rest has gone away. It gets harder to see what people want me to be. Its just me being me im just Charlie Scene. I used to follow my dreams play guitar and scene. Now were ryhming for beats take it seriously. I used to flow with jeez and it was a joke to me. And I would never foresee that I would be a Mc. When I would skate the streets I had a fake Id. I carved my name in a tree back when it was J.T. And now Im telling props cant lie for the rest of our lives. And thats like getting the permanent high five.. Cause people like our tight ryhmes. And hates get a black eye from six crazy white guys. Im just a guy in a band with a mic in my hand. Who decided to rap and fell in love with his fans. And now my flows are the sickest way to 10 by the bitches. and its getting ridiculous on how many inches my dick is. Undead Revolution 1, 2, 3, Go!.

And in the end well find the rest. The rest has gone away. I was up on the wall with j-o-r. I got arrested with wes and the scientist. I used to run with the run my parents sent me away. Producer showed me how to pharase I like it better this way. Now well just fuck up this beat the big God. Shady chain mabye fucked 50 girls a week. I used to skate on the streets. And always people would be pulling guns out at me. I went to heavns last week. I always dances at his shows heading out the blows. you see me and Charlie Scene jack chaining the o's. And our armour sized hold got no omen soul. It's just me and my girls were taking over the world. And the servers got a mind like a ceaser. He writes lyrics eat grapes and fuck his own leisure. And the funny man he aint african hes Mexican. Hard headed like republicans undead revolution. Undead Revolution 1, 2, 3, Go!. And all the days come back to me. Come back to what we used to be. And in the end well find the rest. The rest has gone away. And yesterday we used to say. We never change and stay the same. And in the end well find the rest. The rest has gone away. The rest has gone away. Weve got nothing in this world except for you boys and you girl. well kill to the top as we laught when you watch."
"this love, this hate","In a time of need. Only few can see what's wrong. Millions tend to crawl. But only those who choose can make it through this all. Only few can sing like lions. Cuz we sing until we're gone. And we've got each others backs. Until we're back where we belong. A woman held my shield. And through the battle we did wrong. A man who tell me wisdom through the static we were gone. And maybe when we're gone they'll look into the stars. Every starts got its ending. Even when we've learned to rise above it all. These lies are leading me astray. It's to much for me to stay. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. I see you so please stay strong. I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. And we once also had a story too. You can see that only good men come in few. Even in our greatest moments. We may win or we may lose. Every songs got its rules. You've got to learn to make it through. Maybe one day we can choose. How it feels to be a woman or a man. Without rules we're buried underneath. There's a picture glue. So when my body burns in ashes only sing the truth. Let these words strengthen all your views. Because these words were meant for you. These lies are leading me astray. It's to much for me to stay. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. I see you so please stay strong. I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. And now I'm floatin right above my coffin as it closes. I look down and I see ???. As she's cryin on my mama's shoulder. I look up into the sky as the gates of heaven open. Somethings wrong is this destiny or am I going home. What will happen to my soul. Will I come back I don't know. Will you meet me when it's over and you know. You can meet me here in heaven. Don't you ever let me go. This love, this hate. Is burning me away. These lies are leading me astray. It's to much for me to stay. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. I see you so please stay strong. I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. These lies are leading me astray. It's to much for me to stay. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. I see you so please stay strong. I'll sing you one last sone and then I'm gone. I don't wanna live this destiny. It goes on endlessly. This love, this hate. It's burning me away. This love, this hate. Is burning me away"

Don't pay him for the dope he spits. I'm making it with opiates. Shooting for the moon like I'm racing with the Soviets. Bring the West back, it's feeling vacant now that Kobe quit. I'm rolling in your chick's Accord or my '64. Sipping Coors in a Lincoln Ford, bumping Liquid Swords. Even if I don't agree what the culture shifted towards. I'll die without the music kind of like what Jim with The Doors. They wanna pull me in the gutter like Pennywise. But I'm wise with the pennies, plenty tried. instead I steady rise.

All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home. But you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts. Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart. So we.
