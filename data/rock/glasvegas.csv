a snowflake fell (and it felt like a kiss),The breeze from the. graveyard keeps murmuring death. Too much time harbors thoughts in heads. Now I'm compelled to care. About a future that's going nowhere. As I stand here all alone in the cold. wondering where I'm going today. Then a snowflake fell and it felt like a kiss. Now I'm okay. The ringing from the bells keeps screaming out love. As snow fell from heavens above. Directionless no more. Emptiness no more. Now I don't feel so all alone. in the cold wondering where I'm going today. For a snowflake fell and it felt like a kiss. Now I'm okay
all i want is my baby,"It's all about the money. I hope it makes you happy. Societies opinions, opinions in societies. It's my example I set for my daughter in my family. All I want is my baby. Economic, social and cultural hypocrisy. It kills me inside to hear about half an hour extra custody. When government intervention I can see all too distantly. Little girl feelings matter more than biology. All I want is my baby. All I want is my baby. A phone call, humiliation publicly. Ever heard of karma? Maybe you will do one day. How deluded you saw me in your false ideology. Now you see her - now you don't. Now you see her - now you don't. I'll remember that houdini. All I want is my baby. All I want is my baby. All I want is my baby. Is it still about the money?. Is it still about the money?. I hope it makes you happy"

daddy's gone,"How you are my hero. How you're never here though. Remember times when you put me on your shoulders. How I wish it was forever you would hold us. right now I'm too young to know. How in the future it will affect me when you go. You could have had it all. You, me, and mum y'know. Anything was possible. I won't be the lonely one. Sitting on my own and sad. A fifty year old. Reminiscing what I had. I won't be the lonely one. Sitting on my own and sad. Forget your dad, He's gone. All I wanted was a kick-a-bout in the park. For you to race me home when it was nearly getting. dark. How I could've been yours, and you be mine. It could've been me and you until the end of time. Do what you want, when you want. Be as fuckin' insincere as you can. What kind of way is that to treat your wife. To see your son on saturdays. What way is that to live your life?. I won't be the lonely one. Sitting on my own and sad. A fifty year old. Reminiscing what I had. I won't be the lonely one. Sitting on my own and sad. Forget your dad, he's gone"

How could mother Mary play the hero. If not for bad stuff. The good would never be enough. If not for loneliness. A friend is somewhere in the wilderness. If our love was ever to part ways then.

it's my own cheatin' heart that makes me cry,"Let the raining teardrops rain down on me tonight. I think making up, faking up stories is alright. Tick tock stop the clock, fiction is my thing. My attitude is always i and me and mine. Oh I'm so clever, i'm so clever, I'm so clever. Until my paranoia kicks in then I'll accuse her. Of doing all the worst things I do best. It's funny how me fucking her about. Has got me in this fucking mess. Liar liar liar liar pants on fire. Lies alibis lies more alibis. From the truth, I admit I'm more than shy. Ain't it the times we are living in. Everybody's doing it so why cant I?. I tally up tonight's strangers. And stragglers that I've kissed. Training ground notches, perfectly executed notches. And near misses. It's all about going out and getting pissed with eagle. eyes. And sincerity bottom on my list. What's the story morning glory?. I feel so low and worthless, yeah. So this is where the outcome unfurls and the truth is. being told. A cloud has gathered over my head and now i know. Infidelity and my good friend ecstacy doesn?t work, it. makes you worse. I'm feeling so guilty about the things i said to my. mum when i was ten year old. I'm feeling so guilty about any old shit. And how i think my missus is fucking every guy that. she looks at. This is it, this is it, this is it, this it. The end was always coming and now its here. So this is the grande finale. The crescendo of demise. This is the happy ending. Where the bad guy goes down and dies. This is the end. With me on my knees and wondering why?. Cross my heart, hope to die. It's my own cheating heart that makes me cry. . . adicionado por Thais slima"
later when the tv turns to static,"My street as I remember is still the same. Wonder what the people around here say. Only I can turn things the other way. I think my friends have all gave up on me. Untie my chains, I reach out in apology. Then dance, dance, dance, dance, dance into the future with me. Beware the fences, and the prison defences. And the lies they say inside these walls. Commitments involuntary. It's later when the Tv turns to static. It's quiet on the edge of my bed up in the attic. How I got home tonight seemed so automatic, systematic. Now the outside world looks so cinematic. Only the lonely, in this correctional facility. Isn't it sad, isn't it sad, isn't it a pity. In the still of every night. I pray for the damaged who'll be loved unwillingly. From in a place where no man truly. Can ever really walk away. I didn't want to walk away. It's later when the Tv turns to static. It's quiet on the edge of my bed up in the attic. How I got home tonight seemed so automatic, systematic. Now the outside world looks so cinematic. It's later when the Tv turns to static.

the prettiest thing on saltcoats beach,Go write a message in the sand. Of what you want to say to me. Ice-cream won't be long. Now that I'm here with you. The glistening sea runs through your hands. As you float upon the sparkling sands. The setting sun shines on your hair. I'm walking on the salty air. You are...the prettiest thing. On saltcoats beach. Hand in hand. We stare across the oceans waves. Promise me. We'll do this again some day. The glistening sea runs through your hands. As you float upon the sparkling sands. The setting sun shines on your hair.

the world is yours,Mister mojo's rising. I took a ride. From the L.A. mountains through time. To get you and see you as mine. I dreamt you were mine. Since my eyes saw yours. If i'm your world. Then the world is yours. If my lips kissed yours. If i'm your world. Then the world is yours. Then the world is yours. Mister mojo's dying. Rising inside me is shyness. Hesitations from youth. Eternally hold the hand of me and you. Still I dream. You were mine. Since my eyes saw yours. If i'm your world. Then the world is yours. If my lips kissed yours. If i'm your world. Then the world is yours. Then the world is yours. Talks expensive and subtleties ring blind. Don't let bad timing be the cost of our love lost. Our crippling shyness butchering love all the time. Please please God pull the stars to align. Let's not leave it to another time. Remember in the midst of my dreams when I dreamt you were mine. Through letters of love saying the words. In the right order can be awkward and tough. Time is slipping through. To express how i desire you. It's something i don't know how to. The fear of losing you is elevating me on through. Whilst the undeniable truth is alive and true. You don't need me as much as I need you. You don't need me as much as I need you. The tables have turned to my staggering astound. The wheels in my mind go round and round. And I dreamt you were mine. And I dreamt you were mine. Since my eyes saw yours. If i'm your world. Then the world is yours. If my lips kissed yours. If i'm your world. Then the world is yours. Then the world is yours. Then the world is yours. World is yours. World is yours
youngblood,"Saying nothing. Seems the most heroic of words we can think to say. The ghost of you and me still haunting away. I still see your soft as sad eyes, vividly. Now it's that time we physically separate. Then you'll do it again Youngblood. You'll do it again Youngblood. You'll do it again, do it again. It's part of growing up. Off the edge of the cliff. Goes the vehicle carrying something happy. Love is hard to grasp even when it's easy. Tangible one day, unrecognisable the next day. If you look a little more closely. Then you'll do it again Youngblood. You'll do it again Youngblood. You'll do it again, do it again. It's part of growing up. Youngblood, remember me. Look up at love, don't be careless with my heart of a boy. Look down on love, baby. From you what it destroys and erases. You'll never know. If it comes or goes. So, don't become. Before you what's been done. Moments vanish in eternity, open arms shut that bit more tightly. Our spirits vice tightening ever so slightly. And I still see your soft as sad eyes, vividly. Now it's that time we physically separate. Then you'll do it again Youngblood. You'll do it again Youngblood. You'll do it again, do it again. It's part of growing up. Then you'll do it again Youngblood. You'll do it again Youngblood. You'll do it again, do it again. It's part of growing up"
