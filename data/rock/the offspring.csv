million miles away,"There was a time, looking through myself. Wanting to pretend. If I escaped, I could fill myself. I don't think you can. Been far and wide. But that hole inside. Never really leaves. When I went away, what I really left. Left behind was me. It's telling me. To be on my way home. Million miles away. I can't stay. Each passing day, every passing face. Seems like such a blur. I long to be. Home, silently. Lying next to her. Just to get back, by her side is all. All I need to be. Cause I went away. But what I really left. Left behind was me.

I know your path has been tried and so. It may seem like the way to go. Me, I'd rather be found. Trying something new. And the bottom line. In all of this seems to say. There's no right and wrong way. Sorry if I don't feel like. Living the way you do. *chorus X2*."

Beheaded, bloddy mess all over my clothes. All my collection, adorns my room on bamboo poles. Use to be a little, but a little got more and more. Now I´m craving yours. Night brings bad dreams, bad dreams and guillotines. Off with her head. Off with her head. Off with her head. Off with her head. Off with her head. Off with her head. Find another victim for my machine. Put him in home-made guillotine. Blade falls, gonna need a casket. Watch your head plop in a wicker basket. Leave the house at a quarter to four. Come back with sixteen or more. Cause the more I walk, the more I see. I got a funny feeling coming over me. Beheaded, watch her spurt like garden hose. Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes."
blackball,In this world of hate and shallowness. Where enemies become your consolation. And those of us who win the game give up our minds. I don't call that winning. Say this doesn't apply to you. But ask yourself first. What have I done today to win the game. And just what have I sacrificed. Win the battle lose the war. I know I've played this game before. When people were still real. I don't want this anymore. It's time for me to close the door. There's nothing left to feel. Reflect on all our yesterdays. My own words choke me. Why were they spoken. Regret for the things I've said and done. Just can't compare with. Regret for those that I have never tried. So blame this world or blame yourself. It's really all the same. When you are standing on the precipice. From which you just can't return. Win the battle lose the war. I know I've played this game before. When people were still real. I don't want this anymore. It's time for me to close the door. There's nothing left to feel. In the style of forgotten men. I look to my horizon. I see nothing. While thoughts of guns and desecration. Sweep through my mind. But only coffins and bones remain. As I look to you. The emptiness behind your eyes. Seals my decision. Can't carry on in this world of juggling. Where all this thoughtlessness and bludgeoning. Your key to success. What kind of tradition to carry on. Blackball The new disease. Blackball The new disease. Blackball Your evil ways. Have found their way inside me. Blackball The new disease. Blackball The new disease. Blackball For a better life. In this high tech dog eat dog existence.

Good times we CAN'T REPEAT. Those days are gone and we can. Never get them back. Now we must move ahead. Despite our fear and dread. We're all just wishing we could stop but. Life Goes on. Come of age. Can't hold on. Turn the page. Time rolls on. Wipe your eyes. Yesterday laughs. Tomorrow Cries. With all our joys and fears. Wrapped in forgotten years. The past is laughing as. Today just slips away. Time can't stand what we've made. Cause it's another day. And I'm just wishing we could stop --. Life Goes on. Come of age. Can't hold on. Turn the page. Time rolls on. Wipe these eyes. Yesterday laughs. Tomorrow Cries. Time rolls on

d.u.i.,Three in the morning and I gotta be someplace. I don`t remember where. Friends try to make me stay or call me a cab home. I grab my keys and a beer. The cops they took my license away. But I got my car out of impound today. And I`ve been drunk since last Saturday. You`d better stay outta my way. I drink and drive. Feel so alive. I`ll never take that dive. Feel so alive. I`m doing ninety-five. I drink and drive. I feel so alive. I drink and drive. Early morning and the freeway`s deserted. Like it`s all mine. I`m trying to set a new drunken speed record. But I can`t drive a straight line. Flashing lights. Split the night. I`m tossing bottles as I swerve to the right. Now I`ve slammed my face into the back of a big-rig. At least you`ll never catch me you fucking pigs. Designate someone other than me. I`m so drunk I can hardly see. Another shot of Jager and I turn the key. I got so many places to be. I drink and drive. Feel so alive. I`ll never take that dive. Feel so alive. I`m doing ninety-five. I drink and drive. I feel so alive. I drink and drive. When I`m on a binge. My friends all cringe. They won`t drive at night. 'Cause the way I tear up the freeway is such a fright

demons (a mexican fiesta),"Clouds pass over the moon. Like an eye that shows impending doom. Tension in this misty air. Souls pass into the room. Drawn in by a lost memory. You will join them in the moonlight. You are my offering. Your soul transcends. The centuries of pain. Your misery in life. Is your ecstasy in death. Time passes like the wind. As we race to beat days dusky grin. Mornings just a moment away. Your body glistens in candlelight. As we all look on in fiendish delight. The ritual is just beginning. Come fulfill the prophecy. With our demons of debauchery. As virgins and spectress sing. This madness will never cease. In the dead of night. You will follow. In the footsteps of many others. Who have come before. I will show you the altar. Your aztec eyes, egyptian hair. Your beauty bestoved upon my lair. I've loved you before, in other lives. But youve never ment as much to me. Never meant as much to me as now. In this night of sacrafice. where blood is spilt. That will never spill again. But in your linen robes. We want you now. We want you now. You could never ask for more than that. You are my offering. Your soul transcends. The centuries of pain. Your misery in life. Is your ecstasy in. Come fulfill the prophecy. With our demons of debauchery. This madness will never cease"

i choose,Look at me I'm falling off. Of a cliff now. I can still hear my mama yelling no no no. But the words mean nothing. Can't catch up to me now. And the view is so beautiful. All the way down. When I was a little boy. Sucking juice from a bottle. Believing my perceptions were oh so real. But I didn't know nothing. Still know nothing. Was just enough for me to know the way I feel. This is life. What a fucked up thing we do. What a nightmare come true. Or a playground if we choose. And I choose. Look at me I'm swollen. Like a bananafish now. I'm never gonna make it out of my hole. But I keep on laughing. Doesn't really matter. There's dozens of reasons for explaining my soul. When I was a teenager. Suckin' booze with the vatos. Discussing who was gonna live to be 21. They said they wouldn't make it. They didn't make it. We're all naked when the day is said and done. This is life. What a fucked up thing we do. What a nightmare come true. Or a playground if we choose. And I choose. Don't know who made this all come true. But know while you're here. You just gotta do what you gotta do. Now if I wasn't such a weenie. Do you think you'd still love me. Pretending I'm an airplane on the living room floor. But like a lovely generator. You stand right by me. And if words were wisdom I'd be talking even more. So I keep on falling. As I'm looking back above me. Watching as my mama just becomes a little dot. Now I'm like Deniro. I'm amarillo. And I'll never know when I hit the ground. This is life. What a fucked up thing we do. What a nightmare come true. Or a playground if we choose. And I choose

it'll be a long time,All this time has whittled away. Like so many days in one. Back and forth the leaders sway. Backing it up with guns. Superpowers flex their wings. Hold the world on puppet strings. Egos will feed. While citizens bleed. That's always the way it goes. When will the world listen to reason. I've got a feeling it'll be a long time. When will the truth come in to season. I've got a feeling it'll be a long time. All they want is what they can defend. Before their time is up. Make the same mistakes again. Heard it all before. Superpowers flex their wings. Hold the world on puppet strings. Egos will feed. While citizens bleed. That's always the way it goes. Well if they tried. Maybe they'd see. It'd do a little good to let the world be free. Handshake and a smile. Gets you on through. Then turn it all around with a suicide move. But you know it's not fooling anyone but me. You gotta make yourself see what you want to see

Oh, waves of time. Seem to wash away. The scenes of our crimes. for you this never ends. Can you stay strong?. Can you go on?. Kristy are you doing okay?. A rose that won't bloom. Winter's kept you. Don't waste your whole life trying. To get back what was taken away. Though the marks on your dress. Had been neatly repressed. I knew that something was wrong. And I should have spoke out. And I'm so sorry now. I didn't know. Cause we were so young. Oh, clouds of time. Seem to rain on. Innocence left behind. And it never goes away. Can you stay strong?. Can you go on?. Kristy are you doing okay?. A rose that won't bloom. Winter's kept you. Don't waste your whole life trying. To get back what was taken away"
l.a.p.d.,"When cops are taking care of business I can understand. But the L.A. story's gone way out of hand. Their acts of aggression, they say they're justified. But it seems an obsession has started from the inside. They're shooting anyone who even tries to run. They're shooting little kids with toy guns. Take it to a jury but they don't give a damn. Because the one who tells the truth is always the. policeman. Chorus:. Beat all the niggers. Beat whoever you see. Don't need a reason. (We're) L.A.P.D.. The city of L.A. feels like a prison. With helicopters overhead and bullets whizzing by. Martial law ain't no solution. Police brutality's just social pollution. Beat all the white trash. Beat whoever you see. Don't need a reason. (We're) L.A.P.D.. They say they're keeping the peace. But I'm not buying it because a billy club ain't much. of a pacifier. Protecting your freedom. Now that's just a lie. It's an excuse for power that's more like an alibi. Law and order doesn't really matter. When you're the one getting bruisedand battered. You take it to a jury, they'll throw it in your face. Because justice in L.A. comes in a can of mace. Chorus"

And I can't be friends. I don't know if I can forgive. The day is long. But you were so dead wrong.

lightning rod,I am waiting. On a mountaintop. For the moment that the sky will strike. My apologies. Are forever lost. Soon to ashes in a flash of light. Miles away from me. Hope is fading soon. Gone forever it's a waste of time. My intentions. Like a sweeter room. Only bring to me a fading light. Locked up forever inside. I look to the stars and ask why. If they could just teach my dark heart to feel. All I've saved - why. Is thrown away. I am waning. Like a single bloom. Lost forever in the storm of life. My intentions. Like a sweeter room. Only bring to me a fading light. Locked up forever inside. I look to the stars and ask why. If they could just show these wounds how to heal. Here I am - oh why. My last stand - oh why. And I know For all the rising and falling there's nothing to show. Throw me down. It's been raining. And now I will pay. Woe is come to me. I am the lightning rod. I am waiting. On a mountaintop.

For all the rising and falling there's nothing to show
living in chaos,"Somewhere the time was right, could have been gone in ten. This world is hard to fight, hitting you once, hit it again. To know the way it feels, everyone gets knocked down. When you get up it¹s real, by taking it back, turn it around. Get on it, up on it. Get on it ­ wouldn't wanna be you. Get on it, out on it. Get on it ­ no one¹s gonna free you. You know, when you¹re keeping it slow. No matter where you wanna go ­ wouldn¹t wanna be you. Get on it, up on it. It's on ­ we're living in chaos. Somewhere along the line, things get chipped away. This place keeps going down, gets a little worse every day. I see hate and greed, this world¹s a messed up town. Embrace the pain and see, by taking it back, you turn it around."

Did I do my best. There was a friend I had. CHORUS. Johnny was a weirdo. So what did you expect?. I ain't no fucking hero. I'm just trying to survive myself. I should have known you went through it alone. I wonder why did you even try?. You could have come to me. I would have helped you see. You could have found a way to carry on. Second guess. Did I do my best. There was a friend I had.... CHORUS. 'Johnny's strange behavior was a tip-off,' they say. But I ain't no fucking savior. I'm just living day by day. Little things, little lives hanging 'til the end. I say it doesn't really mean nothing. Telling truth, telling lies. I used to have a friend. I say it don't really mean nothing.

not the one,I'm not the one who made the world what it is today. I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago. But now I deal with all the consequences that troubles our times. I carry on and never once have even questioned why. (yeah) I'm innocent. But the weight of the world is on my shoulders. (yeah) I'm innocent. But thet battles started are far from over. We're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night. We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down. Still we grow and then the problems they become our own. We carry on without even realizing why. (yeah) We're innocent. But the weight of the world is on our shoulders. (yeah) We're innocent. But thet battles started are far from over. We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies. And ruined our streams. We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs. That threaten our lives. Wer'e not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands. We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night. And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed. And if we make some contribution to the plight we see. Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today. They'll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why.
nothing from something,"Things are coming down on me. They never seem to let it be. It seems like everything I say just starts another fight. The pressure's building up inside. I gotta let it out tonight. Shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright. CHORUS. Gonna break it. And never stop running. Making nothing from something. Making nothing from something. . Cut me for the lion's share. It's mindless, but I don't care. 'Cause no matter what I say. I'm in a another fight. Take more shit, I've had enough. Tonight I'm gonna rip it up. Broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright. . CHORUS."

something to believe in,I believe that reality's gone. Disillusion's real. I believe that morality's gone. And there's nothing to feel. If you take the sacred things. The things that we hold dear. Empty promise is all you'll find. So give me something. Something to believe in. I believe in a changing of the guard. Put our feet on the ground. See it happen in your own backyard. Everything breaks down. Do you accept what you are told. Without even thinking. Throw it all and make your own. And give me something. Something to believe in. Where they lead. You will follow. Well I guess that's just the way it goes. And if you look away. You'll be doing what they say. An if you look alive. You'll be singled out and tried. If you take home anything. Let it be your will to think. The more cynical you become. The better off you´ll be
spare me the details,"My girlfriend, my dumb donut. Went out to a party just the other night. But three hours later, and seven shots of Jager. She was in the bedroom with another guy. And I don't really wanna know. So don't tell me anymore. And I really don't wanna hear. About her feet all up in the air. I'm not the one who acted like a hoe. Why must I be the one who has to know. I'm not the one who messed up big time. So spare me the details if you don't mind. Now I can understand. Friends who wanna tell me. Think they're gonna help me open up my eyes. But the play-by-play. Makes me wanna lose it. Every time you do it man it turns the knife. Now I don't need to hear. About the sounds they were making. And I don't need to hear. About how long it was taking. Or how the walls they were shaking. Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow. Missing the tomorrow that we could have had. Running through my head, over and over. Things I never told her now just make me sad. And it drives me insane. Sitting with the vision. Stuck with that image burned into my brain. And I feel so dumb. That I could ever trust her. While someone else fucked her. Then walked away"
