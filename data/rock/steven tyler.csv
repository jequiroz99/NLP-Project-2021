Don't give a damn about the summertime blues. All I need is red, white and you. Can't let those colors fade. Tell me you're gonna stay. American girls making dreams come true. All I need is red, white and. You pulling me a little bit closer. Heart beating like a big bass drum. We spinning on a roller coaster. Free falling into your young mode. All the bad girls rocking in cut-off jeans. And good ol' boys driving big machines. And you can kiss my ass, can't help but say. It's good to be born in the USA. Bang bang, baby, like the 4th of July. A lightning strike in the midnight sky. Don't give a damn about the summertime blues. All I need is red, white and you. Can't let those colors fade.

my own worst enemy,I can blame Jesus. I can blame mama. I can blame Brahma. For all the bullets in my head. I can blame Seagrams. For all the whiksy. For the tipsy. That is still here on my breath. And ain't that Why you left. I'm all alone tongue-tied and twisted. Since I said it ain't you it's me. And girl you cried but I insisted. That what could be would never be. But I was wrong. What is wrong whith me?. I am my own worst enemy. I can blame midnight. For bad decisions. Blurry vision. For what a didn't see. I can blame forever. even though I'll never get it. I can blame your love. even though I often left it. I can blame goodbye. even though I said it. And maybe it was just me. That's why you you have to leave. I'm all alone tongue-tied and twisted. Since I said it ain't you it's me. And girl you cried but I insisted. That what could be would never be. But I was wrong. What is wrong whith me?. And now you're gone. And any fool can see. I am my own worst enemy
only heaven,"You're more than a miracle. An answer to a prayer. You heal the broken heart. In need of much repair. Only heaven could've laid you in my arms. Only heaven could've brought us where we are. Girl, it's heaven when I'm lying in your bed. Cause nothing compares to the taste of your lips. Only heaven could ever feel like this. Only heaven. I was down the dusty road. The end nowhere in sight. And I've been dying in the dark. Now I'm living in your light. And you know it feels so right. Only heaven could've laid you in my arms. Only heaven could've brought us where we are. Girl, it's heaven when I'm lying in your bed. Cause nothing compares to the taste of your lips. Only heaven could ever feel like this. Only heaven.

Never going back. No matter what what what. Pretty is the only life you know. Thanks your face. You're just a hard of way. But even I, even I know. You're never gonna stay this way. One spin and the spine row down. A death wish is to leave this town. Going in blind. Cuz you loose your mind. Then you're going on and on. And on and on. Rolling in the back. You know the skin citty. More in the back. Cuz you know it's reck reck. Glowing in the dark. You're sou pretty pretty. Never going back. No matter what what what. Going to the back. Is only skin city. Dancing through the dark. You know you rage rage. Glowing in the dark. You're sou pretty pretty. Never going back. No matter what what what. Baby when you look in the mirror. Pretty when you hit.

You loose your mind. Then you're going on and on. And on and on"
smile,Smile though your heart is aching. Smile even though it's breaking. When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by. If you smile through your fears and sorrow. Smile and maybe tomorrow. You'll see the sun come shining through for you. Light up your face with gladness. Hide every trace of sadness. Although a tear may be ever so near. That's the time you must keep on trying. Smile what's the use of crying?. You'll find that life is still worth while yeah. If you just smile. That's the time you must keep on trying. Smile what's the use of crying?. You'll find that life is still worthwhile. If you just Smile...
