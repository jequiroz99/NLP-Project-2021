bales of cocaine,"Well, I was workin' on my farm 'bout 1982,. Pullin' up some corn and a little carrot, too. When two low-flying aeroplanes, 'bout a hundred feet high.

My baby and me underneath the stars,. My engine was knockin. But i knew it'd clear real soon.. I was cruisin' along 'bout 95,. I looked in my mirror and man alive. Some guy was gaining on me. As his engine roared.. So i gave that holly carb some gas,. My baby cried out don't let him pass,. I guess it's just that bitch got bored,. I had to race my fucked up ford.. I made the turn at 108,. And he was up on my back gate,. And I knew he had something bad,. Underneath that hood.. So I pushed it up to 110,. That flathead motor was about to give in,. I crossed my fingers and prayed to the lord,. Don't let me down you f***ed up ford.. It's my fucked up ford!. It's my fucked up ford!. When cherry tops began to spin,. I knew this race was about to end,. It's a cop by god. My engine can't give no more.. He threw me in jail, warrant ignored. My car blew up as the oil poured,. I guess it's just that bitch got bored,. I had to race my fucked up ford.. It's my fucked up ford! whoooo!. It's my fucked up ford!"

And time keeps draggin on.. But that train keeps rollin',. On down to San Antone.. When I was just a baby,. My momma told me son,. Always be a good boy,. Don't ever play with guns.. But I shot a man in Reno,. Just to watch him die.. When I hear that whistle blowin',. I hang my head and cry.. Well I bet you all them rich men. Are in fancy dine-in cars.. Probably drinking coffee,. And smokin' big cigars.. Well I know I had it comin'.. I know I can't be free.. But those people keep a movin',. And that's what tortures me.. Well if they freed me from this prison,. And that railrod train was mine,. You bet I'd move it farther,. A little farther down the line.. Far from folsom prison,. That's where I want to stay.. And I'd let that lonesome whistle. Blow my blues away."

All the while smiling though your face hurts.. You do this for ten years. And the day after the back page of some local rag says your great. You see somebody better, and younger than yourself. And he closes the show with a gag he stole from you,. And that's showbiz.. You reward? A fast car you never get to drive,. Ex-wives and kids who do interviews with the scandal sheets. A long cool broad who loves you for your name and your name only.. This afternoon's pizza backstage of some dive you've played a hundred times before. Where rats the size of a loaf of bread climb the walls and run the pipes. Where the same drunk crudely delivers the same insults that you counter. The same way every night.. Except your delivery is a little different, and the people laugh.. That's showbiz.. Your up for the part of leading man in a full length feature film.. And after you read, you get a part..
