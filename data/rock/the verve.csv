Some days I find myself and it feels fine. Some days I find the will and it feels fine. I'm gonna find some time. Left me wasted, out of luck. Looking into black angels that I took. From this street, it's dead end but I was lonely. Looking at the heavens and they disown me, why?. Oh, why?. And if you ever get to Heaven, drop in my line. Say I did do no thieving, I did no crime. I just let myself go, when I was a kid and. Look what you did and did again, Lord. I'm gonna find some time"

And now I see the light shining bright in my eyes. If love is the drug then it ain't for me. Well music is my life. And loved by me. I'm gonna move on the floor with my sweet young thing. Down down down we go till we reach the bottom. Of our soul with this is music"
