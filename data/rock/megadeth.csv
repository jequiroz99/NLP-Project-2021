symphony of destruction,You take a mortal man. And put him in control. Watch him become a god. Watch peoples heads a'roll. A'roll. (Chorus). Just like the Pied Piper. Led rats through the streets. We dance like marionettes. Swaying to the Symphony. Of Destruction. Acting like a robot. Its metal brain corrodes. You try to take its pulse. Before the head explodes. Explodes. (Chorus). Solo - Marty. The earth starts to rumble. World powers fall. A'warring for the heavens. A peaceful man stands tall. Tall. (Chorus)

holy wars... the punishment due,"Brother will kill brother. Spilling blood across the land. Killing for religion. Something I don't understand. Fools like me, who cross the sea. And come to foreign lands. Ask the sheep, for their beliefs. Do you kill on God's command?. A country that's divided. Surely will not stand. My past erased, no more disgrace. No foolish naive stand.

Down in my seat of judgement. Gavel's bang, uphold the law. Up on my soapbox, a leader. Out to change the world. Down in my pulpit as the holier. Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God. Wage the war on organized crime. Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks. Behind the lines. Some people risk to employ me. Some people live to destroy me. Either way they die.. They killed my wife and my baby,. With hopes to enslave me. First mistake... last mistake. Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants. Next mistake... no more mistakes!.

angry again,"The more of you that I inspect. The more of me I see reflect. The more I try to read your lips. The more the mask you're wearing rips. But when I seek out your voice. My ears are overcome with noise. You show and tell with greatest ease. Raving impossibilities. Engaged in crime I grasp my throat. Enraged my mind starts to smoke. Enforce a mental overload. Angry again, angry again, angry ow. And when the story takes a twist. If folds like a contortionist. Slight of hand and quick exchange. The old tricks have been rearranged. Engaged in crime I grasp my throat. Enraged my mind starts to smoke. Enforce a mental overload. Angry again, angry again, angry. The searing of the sinew. My body fights for air. The ripping of the tissue. My lungs begin to tear. Gravity's got my bones. It pulls my flesh away. The steam finally dissipates. I make out my sweaty face. Association that I choose. Game I inevitably lose. Governed by laws set up by me. Fracture it's jaw to let me be. A cut-out cardboard condo maze. Filled with an insubordinate race. Irrational youths stop to stare. As music rubber hosed the air. Engaged in crime I grasp my throat. Enraged my mind starts to smoke. Enforce a mental overload. Angry again, angry again, angry again. And again and again, AGAIN. Engaged in crime I grasp my throat. Enraged my mind starts to smoke. Enforce a mental overload. Angry again, angry again, angry HAOW!."

Who's to say, what's for me to do. Cause a big nothing it'll be for me. The land of opportunity. The golden chance for me. My future looks so bright. Now I think I've seen the light. Can't say what's on my mind. Can't do what I really feel. In this bed I made for me. Is where I sleep, I really feel. I warn you of the fate. Proven true to late. Your tongue twist perverse.

You'll feel my cold breath. It's the kiss of death"

Survival such a silly whim. World leaders sell missiles cheap. Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps. High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea. Nuclear winter spreading disease. The day of final conflict. All pay the price. The third world war. Rapes peace, takes life. Back to the start, talk of the part. When the earth was cold as ice. Total dismay as the sun passed away. And the days where black as night. Eradication of Earth's. Population loves Polaris."

13,"Thirteen times I went to the well. To draw my thoughts, I'll gather and tell. Like bricks that I've laid to build my life. Those that crumbled only caused me strife. Thoughts became words, cast into the sea. But they returned, always haunting me. Like a severed arm washed up on the shore. I just don't think I can give anymore. Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?. Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?. Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me. After everything, you still want me to bleed. Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes. Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive. At thirteen I started down this path. Fueled with anger, music was my wrath. Years of clawing at scars that never healed. Drowning my mind, the thoughts are too real. Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?. Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?. Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me. After everything, you still want me to bleed. Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes. Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive. I can't get out; I can't jump out. Too much to face; I can't erase. Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me"
44 minutes,"It was a cool winter's morning. A wink shortly past 9 am. The only car they wanted for the heist wasn't coming. So instead they went for the bank. The fateful duo that sat in the getaway car. The police sedated with thousands of miles. Armor piercing for the automatic weapons. The police arrived torn out on the ground. Baptized in a firefight. Hot blood running cold as ice. 44 minutes of target practice. All hell is breaking loose. Outgunned, watching the porch. Drawn to a firefight with a pocketknife. There was cold until they saw an Achilles Heel. And it brought down the beast. This was an accident waiting to happen. It wasn't if it was happening, it was when. The city's people sabotaged themselves. Caught in the firepower and the expense. The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped. The standard police issued guns were just not enough. But SWAT arrived to settle the fight. Between AK-47 and AR-15. Baptized in a firefight. Hot blood running cold as ice. 44 minutes of target practice. All hell is breaking loose. Outgunned, watching the porch. Drawn to a firefight with a pocketknife. There was cold until they saw an Achilles Heel. And it brought down the beast"
502,"Pull over, shithead, this is the cops. Full tank, pockets lined with cash. Full throttle, gonna rip some ass.. Drive all day, and through the night,. Romance the road, winding left and right.. The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free.. A feeling inside me, and the whole world to see.. Driving fast makes me feel good,. The speed of light trapped under my hood.. Breaking laws, 'cause there's nothing to do.. Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502. Hundreds of miles rolled off today.. Signs lose their meaning, minutes tick away.. Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all.. Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol.. Drive until daybreak, always on the go.. Life on the freeway, night shift till dawn patrol.. Driving fast makes me feel good,. The speed of light trapped under my hood. Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.. Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.. Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you.. Stars above guide me. This feeling inside me.. I drive until daybreak.. Life on the freeway is Hell.. I'm coming through.."
99 ways to die,If I see the morning hours. I'll have one more yesterday. Take life from tomorrow. Cause I've burned out my today. If I get up to the top I know. I'll just go back downhill. Gotta' terminal future. And it's time to write my will. Down another glass of courage. And a shot of thorazine. We're not ready to see you yet. 99 ways to die. We're not ready to see you yet. Gotta' short between the earphones. Wringing my hands in dismay. A more efficient maniac. With two feet in the grave. Ain't got no last words to say. Yellow streak right up my spine. The gun in my mouth was real. And the taste blew my mind. In a black tie and straight jacket. Man I'm gonna try again. Chorus repeat. Demitasse of arsenic. Try on this tie. Never mind the tree. There is only death and danger. In the sockets of my eyes. A playground of illusion. No one plays they only die. There's a prison in my mind. And the bars are gonna break. I'm as mad as a hatter. And strung out just the same. Taunting rigor mortis. I feel it draw me in.

Living alone, can't stand this place. It's four in the morning and I still see your face. I was nearly pure. When I said I Loved you. You were semi-sincere. You said I'd bleed for you. We were kind of candid. Now you've gone away. You were almost honest, almost. Living alone, falling from grace. I want to atone, but there's just empty space. I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back. Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks. I question the call by the tone of your voice. I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice. It happened that night when you told me to go. Don't ask whose to blame, I don't know. Almost, almost honest. Almost, I was almost honest"

Angry again, angry again, angry ow. And when the story takes a twist. If folds like a contortionist. Slight of hand and quick exchange. The old tricks have been rearranged. Engaged in crime I grasp my throat. Enraged my mind starts to smoke. Enforce a mental overload. Angry again, angry again, angry. The searing of the sinew. My body fights for air. The ripping of the tissue. My lungs begin to tear. Gravity's got my bones. It pulls my flesh away. The steam finally dissipates. I make out my sweaty face. Association that I choose. Game I inevitably lose. Governed by laws set up by me. Fracture it's jaw to let me be. A cut-out cardboard condo maze. Filled with an insubordinate race. Irrational youths stop to stare. As music rubber hosed the air. Engaged in crime I grasp my throat. Enraged my mind starts to smoke. Enforce a mental overload. Angry again, angry again, angry again. And again and again, AGAIN. Engaged in crime I grasp my throat. Enraged my mind starts to smoke. Enforce a mental overload. Angry again, angry again, angry HAOW!."

Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war. Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain. Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again. Chorus. Where do we go from here?. And should we really care?. The end is finally here,. God have mercy!. Now we've rewritten history. The one thing we've found out. Sweet taste of vindication. It turns to ashes in your mouth. Chorus. If you're fighting to live. It's O.K. to die!. The answer to your question is.... Welcome to tomorrow!. Solo - Marty - Marty - Dave. Where do we go from here?. God have mercy!. Chorus."

The world of metal changed forever. Back in the day. Well that was back in the day. And if you weren't there. It doesn't matter anyway. Because you wouldn't understand. Live to die and die to play. Every day and place. Leave a path of metal. Across the world from stage to stage. Well that was back in the day. And if you weren't there. It doesn't matter anyway. Because you wouldn't understand. In denim and leather. We were all part of one force. Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass. And put metal on the course. Higher!. Higher!. Higher!. Higher!. Back in the day. You weren't there. It doesn't mater. Because you wouldn't understand. This is our way of life. A life that was born free. To follow orders how to live. Was never meant to be. Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh. Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting. The power hits the stage. The music was exciting. The mania raged. On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh. We all had the fever. Our ears started to ring. Feeding this wildfire. Consuming everything. Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh. Metal's King back then. And still is this today. Others imitate or challenge. But it never goes away. On, oh-oh, oh-oh"

Time's up, armageddon. Fire... meltdown. The sky is crumbling in. Black curtains... never ending. Escape... you're joking. Can't find no place to run. Hair... is burning. My flesh is bubbling up. Blood... is boiling. Taste copper on my tongue. Fate... is coming. Welcome it with a smile. Black curtains... never ending, fall. Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest. Held for ransom in a spider's web. Suffocating, no one hears my calls. Never ending, till the black curtain falls. Snakes... surround me. Offering their death kiss to me. Down... I'm drowning. How long, I hold my breath. Dogs, are chasing. My legs are paralyzed. Pray... don't find me. My life is fading fast. ."

Blood thirsty demon, sinister fiend,. Bludgeonous slaughters, my evil deeds.. My hammer's a cold piece of blood-lethal steel.. I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal.. Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads,. Deviant defilers, you're next to be dead.. I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent.. Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head. Yeah!. Their bodies convulse, in agony, and, pain.. I mangle their faces, till no features remain.. A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds.. First take out the organs, then cut off the head.. The remains of flesh now sop under my feet.. One more bloody massacre, the murders' complete.. I seek to dismember, a sadist fiend.. And, blood baths are my way of getting clean.. I lurk in the alleys, wait for the kill.. I have no remorse for the blood that I spill. A merciless butcher who lives underground.. I'm out to destroy you and ,I will, cut you down.. I see you, and, I'm waiting ,for Black Friday.. Killer, intruder, homicidal man.. If you see me coming, run as fast as you can.. A blood thirsty demon who's stalking the street.. I hack up my victims like pieces of meat.. I lurk in the alleys, wait for the kill.. I have no remorse for the blood that I spill. A merciless butcher who lives underground..

black swan,"I thought a desire's worth any pleasure, never really been a sin in vain. One hundred and one shots of opportunity, I'd gladly take them all again and again and again. My angel's left me, sorrows are my own. Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own. Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me. It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me. I promised on my soul, not to get carried away. Whirlwind[?] starts on psychedelic, and then it turns to black. My head starts swaying, I forgot what it was that I was saying. I don't know where I am, and I'll never, never make it back. I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt. I fell from grace with deep regret. My angel's left me, sorrows are my own. Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own. Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me. It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me. Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see. It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me. My angel's left me, sorrows are my own.

A pale horse and pestilence led by a. Black horse with famine and scales. The doctrine of hatred. Nation will rise against nation. Wash me in blood and let me be. The firstborn of the dead. A crowned rider with arrows and bow. A red rider with a great firey sword. Flames come from the one called death. Horror and apocalypse follows. (RIDE!) Won't you four horsemen ride again. Before this kingdom is blown to kingdom come. I hold fast to what I believe. Till I see my name in stone. Blessed are the dead. A white horse on the clouds of death. A red warhorse to end all wars. A pale horse and pestilence led by a. Black horse with famine and scales. The synagogue of satan. Nation will rise against nation. Wash me in blood and let me be. The firstborn of the dead.

bullet to the brain,"No one knows what draws the moth to the flame. And nothing costs as much as playing the game. She had to know, know, know... He'd give love for sex. He had to know, know, know... She'd give sex for love. The taste, touching his tongue, sweet to his lips. Poison, now penetrating deeper. Betrayed by just one bite, for just one night. To find forbidden fruit tastes sweeter. Just like pressing a loaded gun to your head. One knows only the spider can navigate its web. She had to know, know, know... He'd get what he wants. He had to know, know, know... She'd get what she needs. Soon under the spell, emotions are high. Mind control penetrating deeper. The hex was cast on him, all he believes. Now is forbidden fruit tastes sweeter. She had to know, know, know... He'd win at the start. He had to know, know, know... She'd win in the end. His one last thought blew his mind, bullet to the brain. Hot lead was penetrating deeper. Just one reckless shot squeezed from the hand. That knows forbidden fruit tastes sweeter"
burn!,"I've got a sickening feeling. My life is standing still. It's clear that fate is closing in. But this is the life I choose. I've got so much time to kill. Born to lose, I'll die to win. Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good. I'm getting on my own nerves. And I get no satisfaction. Till I light it up and burn it down. One match lights my fire. And it starts a chain reaction. That burns my crooked past to the ground. Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good. Burn, baby burn... like I knew it would. Fire, I've got the fire. Fire, burning desire... my desire to burn. [Solo - Dave]. I hear the darkness call. The sirens are growing near. It's time I make my great escape. The flames are getting tall. Inside my rear view mirror. Just a spark is all it takes"
burning bridges,"Dave Mustaine. You give up on yourself. Somehow you got betrayed agin. Thin ice and luck runs out. Who will you blame it on this time?. Due to lack of interest in you. The light at the end of the tunnel. Was turned off. And something I noticed. Beating you is thrilling me. I've got a secret for you. If you took your own direction. If only you practice what you preach. If you follow your advice. You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time. Don't close your eyes to injustice. Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit. A man without any valor. Has nothing worth living for. Due to lack of interest in you. The light at the end of the tunnel. Was turned off. And something I noticed. Beating you is thrilling me. I've got a secret for you. If you took your own direction. If only you practice what you preach. If you follow your advice. You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time. Solo - Mustaine. Solo - Pitrelli. If you took your own direction. If only you practice what you preach. If you follow your advice. You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time. If you took your own direction. If only you practice what you preach. If you follow your advice. You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time. . ."
burnt ice,"He said he'd try just a little bit. He didn't want to end up like them. And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder. Pounding on the door to make the next score. Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it. For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul. Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell. He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell. Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies. His cause of death... high speed on burnt ice. Always looking at the ground, a broken, beaten man. Memories of his family are calling after him. He can hardly thing, hardly walk. Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk. With just one hit the pain would go away. But he's dead if he does. Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes. Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows"
captive honour,"Madness comes, and madness goes. An insane place, with insane moves. Battles without, for battles within. Where evil lives and evil rules. Breaking them up, just breaking them in. Quickest way out, quickest relief wins. Never disclose, never betray. Cease to speak or cease to breathe. And when you kill a man, you're a murderer. Kill many, and you're a conqueror. Kill them all...Ooh...Oh you're a god!. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,. Have you reached a verdict?. Yes, we have Your Honour, we find the defendant guilty!. On all counts for crimes against all humanity.. By virtue of the jury's decision and the power. Vested in me by the state I hereby sentence you to be. Incarcerated with no possibility of parole for life. Life?...Whadda ya mean life?...I ain't got a life. Boy!...Your soul better belong to Jesus!.... Hmmm-mmm cause your ass belongs to me!. Captive honour, ain't no honour. No time for questions. No time for the games. Start kicking ass. And taking down the names. A long shit list. A shorter fuse. He is untouchable. And guarantees you'll lose. Inside the bighouse. His nightmare unfolds. Before he got there. His manpussy was sold. Black blanket welcome. This tough guy's now a bitch. Praying for death. It can't be worse than this."
chosen ones,"You doubt your strength or courage. Don't come to join with me. For Deth surely wants you. With sharp and pointy teeth. An animal so vicious. No others fought and won. So on the fields of battle. We are the chosen one. Human bones blanket. the dirt of the heathens lair. That we must pass this den of deth. The only path from here. But I walk in the light. The time to die has come. No one shall take my life. I'm of the chosen ones. Black shadows till the sky. As the creatures eyes grow near. Raise the shield of the holy pilgrims. High into the air. Heavens powers fill my arms. Onward now to fight I'm sent. Oh the beast is coming. To put you to the test. Lookout!. Now this land is mine to pilage. Rape, and steal, and take at will. Never let you cross this path. I reign,. for now,. I stay.... I stay to Kill. You doubt your strength or courage. Don't come to join with me. For Death surely wants you. With sharp and pointy teeth. An animal so vicious. No others fought and won. So on the fields of battle. We are the chosen one"
cold sweat,"Cold sweat. I put my money in the suitcase. And headed for the big race. I felt a chill on my backbone. As I hung up the telephone. Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat. Running down the back of my neck. To lose means trouble, to win pays double. And I got me a heavy bet. Cold, cold sweat. They say chances on the outside. Are looking very slim. I've been so lucky on the inside. I feel I'm going to win. Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat. Running down the back of my neck. Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose. And I got me a heavy bet. Cold, cold sweat. I've got me a whole month's wages. I haven't seen that much in ages. I might spend it in stages. And move out to las vegas. Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat. Running down the back of my neck. To lose means trouble, to win means double. And I got me a heavy bet. Cold, cold sweat. I put my money in the suitcase. They say chances on the outside. I got a whole months wages. Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat. Stone cold crazy. Place another bet"
coming home,"And today, I leave you. But I'll be back someday. And as I fly away. My hope is that we'll meet again. I'm off to my home away from home. I will miss you. But I know. I know you know. I'm coming home to Arizona. I'm coming home to Arizona. I'll take you everywhere I go. I'll show you everything I see. And as we say so long. I know your tears wish me well. It won't be long till I'm back again. We will meet again. We will meet again. You will see, oh. I'm coming home to Arizona. I'm coming home"
conjuring,"Welcome to our sanguinary sect or worship. Feel at home in our black conventicle. As we anathmastise. All those who oppose us.. Don't summon the devil,. Don't call the priests. If you need the strength,. The conjuring, obey!. Behold! the flames rise. From the compass' cardinal points. Burn the sacred oil,. And with the ashes you'll annoint. Arrange the symbols. Of the wizard and magician.. Light the candles,. Place the parchment paper in position. Between its leaves place. The lash from a black cat's eye,. A straw of a broom,. Fold, burn and centralize.. Don't summon the devil,. Don't call the priests. If you need the strength,. The conjuring.. I am the devil's advocate. A salesman, if you will.. You know my name.. I met your father years ago. Gave him what he'd please.. He called my name, you'll do the same.. I'm claiming what is mine by right. It's time to close the deal.. You're bought and sold, bought and sold.. Come join me in my infernal depths,. Mephisto's Hall of Fame. I've got your soul, I've got your soul.. The conjuring. Obey!"

countdown to extinction,"Endangered species, caged in fright. Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight. The stage is set, now pay the price. An ego boost, don't think twice. Technology, the battle's unfair. You pull the hammer without a care. Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man. Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned.... The hunt is canned. Chorus. All are gone, all but one. No contest, nowhere to run. No more left, only one. This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction. Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare. The skin and trophy, oh so rare.

crown of worms,"I am the author, dream up your pain. Drink as did Bacchus, rebel just like Cain. Lord of the city, I shall remain. All pandemonium I shall reign. Set in my fortress up on my hill. Drinking the wine till I've had my fill. Building up high, my castle walls. Oh, to veil my splendid fall. I present you this crown of worms. Surrounding myself with misery. Drawn curtains heavy of my history. Exquisite I am, perfect unity. On my left hand is false majesty. I feign affection, refute the true story. Dispute with creation, the lie is my glory. I care for no one, my gospel is death. For me the light's gone, only darkness is left. I present you this crown of worms. As black in deed, as cold as stone. A commandment of one, as proud as gold. As neglected in spirit, as time is old. As legion is numbers, as legend is told. I am alone with agony of truth. My power of will. My judgment and chain. My end is knowledge and conscience of guilt. My final confusion hidden from me till I'm done"

dance in the rain,"(Vocals - Mustaine). Sentenced to work a dead end 9 to 5. Trapped in a dingy corporate cubicle hell. Then go to work in the darkness on the midnight shift. Any chance you get, selling gas at the corner Shell. Three letters groups listening in on you. Under surveillance courtesy of Big Brother in your car. Drones monitor each and every move you make. It doesn't matter who you know or who you think you are. You'll never see a ray of daylight. So far in debt you're struggling to survive. But you will break your back fighting and they'll help. Before you let them break your pride. ""Powers that be"" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready. You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun. Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come. Solo - Dave. Down on your luck, you had your hand out once or twice. But all you wanted was just a hand, they say. ""You have the right to remain silent"", so shut your mouth. Don't mention the broken promises and lies of hope and change. ""Powers that be"" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready. You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun. Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come. Solo - Chris. Never come, dance in the rain, it ain't gonna come. Solo - Dave. (Vocals - Draiman). Enslave and impoverish the middle class. Make them dependent then strip it all away. Al-CIA-da, destruction, and democide. Addiction, corruption, every word's a lie. (Vocals - Mustaine). Races, classes, sexes, religious wars. Destroy the family, and what love is for. (Vocals - Draiman). The Fed and the Bankers own all the politicians. May I introduce you to the sons of perdition?. Replace the dictators Washington appointed. The Devil Messiahs and the dangerously disappointed. Vocals - Mustaine Draiman). They lie to themselves, pleased with what they've done. Soon they all will be repaid and there's nowhere to run"
dawn patrol,Thermal count is rising. In perpetual writhing. The primordial ooze. And the sanity they lose. Awakened in the morning. To more air pollution warnings. Still we sleepwalk off to work. While our nervous systems jerk. Pretending not to notice. How history had forebode us. With the green house in effect. Our environment was wrecked. Now I can only laugh. As I read our epitaph. We end our lives as moles. In the dark of dawn patrol. .
deadly nightshade,"Come now my lovely, won’t you. Take a midnight stroll with me?. Through the misty air the things. I keep I shouldn’t dare. My garden’s so inviting, and its. Deadly blooms are hiding. Be careful what you touch. Lest the grave is what you lust. Draw the blinds, you’re getting tired. Paralyzed, don’t close your eyes. Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares. From the deadly nightshade. Each night at midnight. Dating back into the fog of time. Another victim falls. The things I’ve done; the voices call. The hourglass runs out on us. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The killers must be fed, the soil is red. Now that you’re dead. Delirium – your burning throat. Mania – your heart rate soars. Hallucination – you’re losing your mind. Suffocation – cannot breathe; you’re going blind"
death from within,"The heat is raging from the rising fires of war. Embers of avarice soon begin to soar. Vengeance breeding greater vengeance. two eyes for one eye. Crowning burning hatred that's lying deep inside. A token gift, destroyers deep within its hold. Revenge of patient men is sweet and best served cold. The enemy inside the belly of the beast. A mighty trojan horse, tonight the sentries sleep. On the march... No place to run. Time has come... No where to hide. The moon is red... No one is safe. From spilling blood... No living thing survives. Here they fight... Regretting nothing. Here you die... The walls are caving in. Nothing left... A lethal encounter. Its judgment time... When death comes from within. Warning signs ignored, they have all but been denied. Prophets and messengers, mocked and vilified. Final destination lying deep inside their court. Their first line of defense soon became their last resort. Hardened deceivers entered through their open gates. Silent trained assassins, lying still, in wait. You look so perfect, but everybody knows. Their petrified to say the emperor has no clothes. So bloody perfect, but everybody knows. Their just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes. Death from within"
devil's island,"The light that fills my lonely cell. Is blocked out by the key. That locks the door to this hell. The place they wanted me. Time's racing like the wind. Execution's near. Oh lord, I wait for death. And, yes, I have no fear. I recall that night, my every breath. And step along the way. Closed my eyes, walking. As danger paved the way. The devil, and the darkness. Let her evil wander free. Here on Devils Island. The final stop for me. Devils Island, Devils Island. Oh, there's no escape. The sea is full of sharks. Tide takes you away, and. Smash you on the rocks. The sun is shining. But feel not today. It's warmth, it's dying. And fading away. Devils Island, here I stay, Devils Island. Oh, hear the call. From the grave beyond. Oh, so pernicious. Her soul it creates song. As there is no man. That is here upon the earth. Able to terminate our. Noisome will since birth. The priest that reads the sermon. Is walking next to me. To the stake my last request. To have her burn with me. And so it did, the heavens opened. Rain began to fall. Final judgement came and. Was spread before you all. Final judgement. Old, weak, and feeble,. And the lesson taught to me. Stay away from evil,. She doesn't care for me. She haunts me in my sleep. Though I tore that page away. Here on Devils Island. I'll always have to stay. Devils Island, Devils Island. Devils Island, Devils Island. Here I am"
diadems,"Sacriledge and blasphemy. Sets the stage today. The more insatiable the sex. The more swelled our tongues became. As pre-historic as it seems. This is now, today. As pre-historic as it seems. This is now. Talkin' 'bout no vision. Talkin' 'bout no dream. The Harlot puddles for her lies. From where she speaks. I look above and see. Entrails in the sky. This song ain't over 'til the. Fat lady dies. One man rules the earth. And rides the seven-headed beast. Ten diadems, to rule them all, to crown them all. The world, religion at his feet. Dreams are told of dreams of old. This day will surely come. So, run my child and hide your face. Once you've been marked it's finished, done. You'll become one. You're mine. You're one. I saw a new earth today. I saw a former pass away. I saw a new earth today. I saw a former pass away. Vengence is mine. Vengence is mine. The Netherworld and Sheol. Are never satisfied. So the eyes of Man are. Never sat-is-fied. I saw a new Earth today. I saw a former pass away."
die dead enough,"It's twilight and I wake up hot. My body’s soaked in a cold, cold sweat. I reenact the lurid scenes. And clawed engravings in my head. Oh, I can’t punch hard enough and I run. I can’t kick high enough and I run. I can’t shoot straight enough and I run. I can’t hold on enough and I run. Oh, I can’t stay down enough and I run. I can’t take pain enough and I run. I can’t bleed fast enough. I can’t die dead enough. The air is thick, but the oxygen’s thin. My heart is beating like a drum, boom!. And ice is flowing through my veins. Explosives on my lips and in my lungs. Oh, I can’t punch hard enough and I run. I can’t kick high enough and I run. I can’t shoot straight enough and I run. I can’t hold on enough and I run. Oh, I can’t stay down enough and I run. I can’t take pain enough and I run. I can’t bleed fast enough. I can’t die dead enough. I don’t know what I’m running from. And I don’t know where I’m running to. There’s something deep and strange inside of me I see. I don’t know what I’m running from. And I don’t know where I’m running to. Something’s compelling me to run into the dark. And now I am more driven than before. And now I live just to settle score. And now I feel the nearness of your breath. Now I introduce you to your death. I am more driven than before. I live just to settle score. I feel the nearness of your breath. I introduce you to your death. I can’t punch hard enough. I can’t kick high enough. I can’t shoot straight enough. I can’t hold on enough. I can’t stay down enough, die dead enough. I can’t take pain enough, die dead enough. I can’t bleed fast enough, die dead enough. I can’t die dead enough, die dead enough"
disconnect,Behind closed doors all you live for is taking. That double life of yours has left your whole world shaking. Who are you fooling? I know you hear the laughter. Don't you hear people talking? What is it that your after?. Turn off your conscience. Leave the world outside. Nothing at all can ever make you feel. That anything's so real so you just - Disconnect. The key to save yourself if for nothing else. A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden. With a broken heart underneath all of the pain. Do you stroke the pretty scars? The hurt never ends. Turn off your conscience. Leave the world outside. Nothing at all can ever make you feel. That anything's so real so you just - Disconnect. Solo - Mustaine. Turn off your conscience. Leave the world outside. Nothing at all can ever make you feel. That anything's so real so you just - Disconnect. Turn off your conscience. Leave the world outside. Nothing at all can ever make you feel. That anything's so real so you just - Disconnect. End Chorus Solos - Pitrelli / Percussion - Chris Vrenna.
don't turn your back,"When things were good. I know you would always be there for me. Yes, It's true; friends like you are few and far between. I wish I may, I wish I might, the things you do ain't quite right. Just ain't right. And still we try to pretend. That you will be here in the end. The best advice that I can lend. Don't ever turn your back on a friend. Don't turn your back. When things were bad. you always had something else better to do. It's just a lie to think that I could ever mean anything to you. You steal what's mine then help me look for it. how many times do I pay for it? How many times?. And still we try to pretend. That you will be here in the end. The best advice that I can lend. Don't ever turn your back on a friend. And still we try to pretend. That you will be here in the end. The best advice that I can lend. Don't ever turn your back on a friend. Don't turn your back"
dread and the fugitive mind,"Let me introduce myself I'm a social disease. I've come for your wealth leave you on your knees. No time for feeling sorry, I got here on my own. I won't ask for mercy, I choose to walk alone. What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too. If you shake my hand better count your fingers. What if I do get caught? What if there is no judgment?. If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all. I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked. I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences. Are Dread and the Fugitive Mind. You built walls to protect you so no one will infect you. Pursued by those out there that vanish in thin air. Come a long way to find what you really left behind. You don't know when the end is but it's coming fast. What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too. Do you shake my hand, then i'll count your fingers!. What if I do get caught? What if there is no judgment?. If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all. I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked. I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences. Are Dread and the Fugitive Mind"
dystopia,"What you don't know,. The legend goes ""Can't hurt you"". If you only want to live and die in fear. They tell us to believe just half of what we see. And absolutely nothing that we hear. Resist the twisted truth no matter what the cost. Supplant the rights and wrongs inside our heads. Outlawing all the questions to the answers. That no one likes when someone ends up dead. Dystopia X4. What you don't know,. the legend goes ""can't hurt you"". If you only want to live and die in a cage. There's panic and there's chaos. rampant in the streets. Where useless thoughts of peace are met with rage. Demoralized and overmastered people think. The quickest way to end a war is lose. Dictatorship ain't starting with tyrannicide. You must destroy a cancer at it's root. Dystopia X4"
ecstasy,You live in a world of fantasy. You live in a web of deceit. You want it all including me. You like it all to be neat. I come to you when shadows fall. I leave as the dawn arrives. Hide the truth to deceive them all. How my good intention lies. Try to silence the suspicions. Feeding the dark inhibitions. We can never let anyone see. The sin I bring called ecstasy. The sin I bring ecstasy. Secret meetings that we hide. Deeds of iniquity. The price of foolish pride. The cost of immorality. And we hide the truth to deceive them all. And the pain of what will never be. Try to silence the suspicions. Feeding the dark inhibitions. We can never let anyone see. The sin I bring called ecstasy. The sin I bring .... Ecstasy.
elysian fields,"Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes. I hope the end is less painful than my life. I stand on trial before the gods. On judgement day. A blink of an eye between. The cradle and the grave. One last look at visions of flesh. The last best hope of man on Earth. Pontius Pilate still washing his hands. The world don't want to be saved. Only left alone. Elysian Fields.... We are storming the heavens. We raise the swords and shields. We ascend to our destiny. To the Elysian Fields. Soaring to the sun. With blood upon their wings. Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind. Man still has one belief,. One decree that stands alone. The laying down of arms. Is like cancer to their bones."

And this is what I dream every night. The Leader of the New World Order, the President of the United States. Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A. Without the RFID chip, you're just an illegal alien. An enemy combatant of America, welcome to the New World Order. This is the end of the road; this is the end of the line.

Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die, the clock is. Ticking so slowly and so much can happen in an hour. I learned my lessons the hard way, every scar I earned. I had to bleed, inside the day yard. A system of controlled movement, like a giant ant farm. Any time is long time, now you're not in charge of your time anymore. The Ex-President signed a secret bill that can. Land a legal US Citizen in jail and the. Patriot act stripped away our constitutional rights. They say a Concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!. Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecute and beat by the. Tyranny of Mind control, for the mark of the beast.

evil that's within,"There once was a familiar face. Battle scars in disarray. A simple man, power drunk. No worries of living, no more anything. Deep inside I've seen it rise. Bastards possesses to no end. Mirror, mirror, please look inside. Do you see the evil that's within?. Pyramids of dead men and dogs. Spoils of war so they say. Once burned, forever marked. Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay. Deep inside I've seen it rise. Bastards possesses to no end. Mirror, mirror, please look inside. Do you see the evil that's within?. Pressure coming down. Down on me, gonna break. Broken fingernails. Digging in, scratch your face. Nervous, like a cat. Gonna jump through my skin. Shadows on the wall. Stretching out, grope for me. Evil, evil. Evil, deep in me. Evil, let me be. Evil, let me bleed. Evil, set me free. Evil, set me free. Evil, set me free. The evil that's within"
family tree,"Forgotten things remembered,. The tigers eat their young.... The body stayed but inside the head,. The mind was on the run.. A conspiracy of silence.. The only way out of pain,.

It's our secret, you and me. Let me show you, how I love you,. But keep it in the family.... When you hear them saying ""trust me"",. Don't wait to see what's next.... Thrown to the wolves forever trusting. Raised in a form of living hell.. Sing a one note song of rage. Live and die within your heart. So beware in the shadows,. Your family tree waits in the dark.

Addicted to the fast lane. Rushing to my brain. No time to explain, this is my domain. Addicted to the fast lane. I look into mirror, red lights are drawing nearer. They think I’ve met my match. But I shift into high gear, soon they just disappear. You can’t jail what you can’t catch. I hear the engines screaming. I’m burning up the…"
fatal illusion,"Lost inside the system,. locked away without a key. No one will ever miss. a menace to society. A gross lack of potential,. bad decisions made in spite. A touchy hairpin trigger. and such a wasted life. Trying to break the mold. of a broken family. Fighting damn sure failure,. and living on his knees. Guilty of the crime of nonconformity. A hanging judge and jury. handing down the penalty. A lethal injection,. now they watch the body jerk. Exterminate the problem,. except it didn?t work. No vital sign of life,. they declared it wasn?t there. Coroner never checked,. because he didn?t fucking care. Passing off the body,. they all believe he died. Starting up the hearse,. set out for a final drive. Like whistling past a graveyard,. when walking by at night. It?s a fatal illusion. to think that evil ever dies. In a darkened mortuary,. reeking of formaldehyde. Aroused from deadly slumber,. something opened up his eyes. Spilling all their blood. was a promise that he?d keep. Hate so strong revived him. from a deep necrotic sleep. Clawing away the casket lid. until his fingers bleed. He grabbed a knife. and set out on a vivisection spree. A butcher, hell bent,. massacring each one with his blade. From the first one to the last,. he dispatched them to the grave. It?s a fatal illusion?. Evil never dies. It never dies"
fff,"Looking for a cure within the human race. Eliminate the poor, how much longer will it take. Burning up the tents of the rank and file. Exterminate their lives, crack a demon smile. Crushing down, caving in our will to live. Getting rid of man's mistakes. To take a lost life, lock it down. How much more can we take. Fight for freedom, fight authority. Fight for anything, my country 't is of me. Cry for absolution, it's not the end for me. A last minute pardon, a final reprieve. Resist the war machine, don't get in its path. Fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath. Crushing down, caving in our will to live. Getting rid of man's mistakes. To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down. I don't know how much more I can take. Fight! ... It's my country."

Parade the grey robed monks. The vestal virgins, wheel the wyvern's in. Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage. Let me bethe protege. Of five magics. Give me Alchemy. Give me Wizardry. Give me Sorcery. Thermatology. Electricity. Magic if you please. Master all of these. Bring him to his knees. I master five magics. Possessed with hellish torment. I master magics ""5"". Hunting the abyss lord. Only one will stay alive. He who lives by the sword. Will surely also die. He who lives in the sin. Will surely live the lie"
foreclosure of a dream,"Rise so high, yet so far to fall. A plan of dignity and balance for all. Political breakthrough, euphoria's high. More borrowed money, more borrowed time. Backed in a corner, caught up in the race. Means to an end ended in disgrace. Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase. Foreclosure of a dream. Those visions never seen. Until all is lost. Personal Holocaust. Foreclosure of a dream. Barren land that once filled a need. Are worthless now, dead without a deed. Slipping away from an iron grip. Nature's scales are forced to tip. The heartland cries, loss of all pride. To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried. Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide. Now with new hope some will be proud. This is no hoax, no one pushed out. Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer. Break new ground of a new frontier. New ideas will surely get by. No deed, or dividend. Some may ask ""Why?"". You'll find the solution, the answers in the sky. Rise so high, yet so far to fall. A plan of dignity and balance for all. Political breakthrough, euphoria's high. More borrowed money, more borrowed time. Holocaust."

It's getting cold outside and it looks like rain. The sky is falling and my heart is caving in. So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye. The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes. Day after day after day the world will pass you by. You forget to remember. If this is living, what the hell is living for?. You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the door.

I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie. You forget to remember... It's time to say the long goodbye"

The smell of death permeates the silk within my coffin lays. Go to hell. As they bury me now six feet there my body lies. Still feel like I'm giong down. I hear a distant wailing cry. God something must've gone wrong. And much too late I realize. Go to hell. I saw my funeral that day. I know who didn't show to mourn. My judgement was life in hell. Pillars of pain and thorns. My only friend's the goat. With 666 between his horns. Go to hell. Place all your trust here in me. Rest assured these things I know. And as Charon sails the sea. Your journey too shall end below. Ah yes you're all sitting ducks. It's true you reap what you sow. Go to hell. Now I lay me down to sleep. Blah, blah, blah my soul to keep. If I die before I wake. I'll go to hell for heaven's sake"

The fragmented skull and shattering bones. There's nothing you can do!"

holy wars... the punishment due,"Brother will kill brother. Spilling blood across the land. Killing for religion. Something I don't understand. Fools like me, who cross the sea. And come to foreign lands. Ask the sheep, for their beliefs. Do you kill on God's command?. A country that's divided. Surely will not stand. My past erased, no more disgrace. No foolish naive stand. The end is near, it's crystal clear. Part of the master plan. Don't look now to Israel. It might be your homelands. Holy wars. Upon my podium, as the. Know it all scholar. Down in my seat of judgement. Gavel's bang, uphold the law. Up on my soapbox, a leader. Out to change the world. Down in my pulpit as the holier. Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God. Wage the war on organized crime. Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks. Behind the lines. Some people risk to employ me. Some people live to destroy me. Either way they die.. They killed my wife and my baby,. With hopes to enslave me. First mistake... last mistake. Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants. Next mistake... no more mistakes!. Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite. Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't. Thinkin' it.. Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away. I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose. And the lack of mercy killings."

how the story ends,"Far off on the horizon you can barely see their torches. But rest assured they're out there and they're coming. If you listen, the sound is growing nearer of infantry. Marching out a hypnotizing rhythm. Destroying every town. Light it up and burn it down. You may not like it now. But this is how the story ends. Above the ring of clashing steel, they raise flags of war. A sign to all the warriors who cannot hear. Amidst smoke of cannonballs, they bang the drums of death. Pound a cadence out for those who cannot see. Destroying every town. Light it up and burn it down. You may not like it now. But this is how the story ends. Poison the well and scorch the earth. Everything is slashed and burnt. You may not like it now. But this is how the story ends. Destroying every town. Light it up and burn it down. You may not like it now. But this is how the story ends. Poison the well and scorch the earth. Everything is slashed and burnt. You may not like it now. But this is how the story ends"

i'll be there,"Dave Mustaine/Bud Prager/Marty Friedman. I heard the voice of redemption. For me there is no exemption. I started praying. I heard the voice of satisfaction. Needing me for benefaction. I started pleading. I heard the bells begin to chime. Warning me oh lord. Don't let this be my time. Don't let this be my time. I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire. I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher. When nothing fits and nothing seems right. Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you. You saw me slide, you saw me fall. We kept our pride through it all. We started screaming. When skies are dark, no sun shines through. I know I see the light in you. We stopped dreaming and started believing. I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire. I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher. When nothing fits and nothing seems right. Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you. I'll be there. In my hour of need. You were there always.

You're the only one that I'm thinking of.... You'll never know how hard I tried. To find my space and satisfy you too.. Things will be better when I'm dead and gone. Don't try to understand, knowing you, I'm probably wrong.. But, oh, how I lived my life for you!. Still you'd turn away. Now as I die for you,. My flesh still crawls, as I breathe your name.

There's a better place for me. But it's far, far away. Everlasting life for me. In a perfect world. But I gotta die first,. Please God send me on my way !. Time has a way of taking time,. Loneliness is not only felt by fools.. Alone I call to ease the pain,. Yearning to be held by you.. Alone so alone, I'm lost. Consumed by the pain. The pain, the pain, the pain..

I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie. Don't you think I have friends besides you?. You called me out, you couldn't resist. I'll never stop until I find you. That's when you're gonna cease to exist. How stupid do you have to be?. To think the trail of evidence that you've left. Won't boomerang back in your face. To your moth-eaten brain by meth. Like the wolf that does not howl. Concealed and ready to attack. It's time to pay with your flesh. And you'll never stop me. I look who's talking and I see. A big nothing looking back at me. Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why. I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie. The dogs that bark the loudest are the dogs that have no teeth. I look who's talking and I see. A big nothing looking back at me. Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why. I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie. Look at you!. Look who's talking, a big nothing looking back at me. Would you look at you?. Look who's talking, a big nothing, that's all I see. Won't you look at you?. Look who's talking, a big nothing, it's what you mean to me. Oh, but you're never gonna be anything anyway. Now roll over and play dead"
looking down the cross,"Now before they take me and my blessed life. Now you'll know why death was summoned here tonight. I'll recall my perils, they'll kill me in pride. No, I can't run away there's no place to hide. Though too much to live for, I owe enough to die. Ask not for salvation, my death shall mean their lives. Hatred and guilt they alter they've built high priests of sin. Destiny, fate the wicked ones gate beckoning you in.. Down the walkways, through the blood stained town. Looking down the cross, bleeding from the crown. Led to stay to die besides the thieves. Kill the king of the world to be. And now to you, this will come. A putrifying pestolence. More noxious than the serpents breath. Male violently destined. More corrupt than the malice of choronzon. More disease than the wind. Of the moonlight sun. Putrification you have caused. No need for confession. Now you wish you had a gun to stop the demolition. Swinging the judgement hammer. Man, woman, child no-one is safe. The heads of the dead are the banner. And this was all you got. So don these broken wings. Sands of time run out. Bells of Hades ring. Is this a nightmare. To unhallow thy name. Smell of brimstone. Dancing in the flames. No help now as you fulfill his task. Chief of evil has got you by the ass. Set free to sit upon the throne. Just a dream?. Your weeping all alone!. Looking down the cross. (Speak no evil). I'm looking down the cross. (Speak no evil)"

lucretia,"Sitting up late at night. I tiptoe through the darkness. Cold as hell black as spades. Aware of my immediate surrounding. In my place I escape. Up into my hideout. Hiding from everyone. My friends all say. Dave you're mental any way hey!. Drift into a deeper state. I stalk the cobwebbed stairways. Dirt grits beneath my feet. The stair creaks, I precariously sneak. Hypnosis guides my hand. I slipslide through the walkways. Sit in granny's rockin' chair. Memories are whirling by yeah. Reminisce in the attic. Lucretia waits impatiently. Cobwebs make me squint. The cobra so eloquently glints. Moonbeams surge through the sky. The crystal ball's energized. Surely that like the cat waiting. Lucretia rocks away."
lying in state,"What we are witnessing. is the decline of western civilization. Crushing our potential and piling it on. how will history portray us?. Attack the family, attack their faith and dreams. Attack the body and the head will fall.. A lasting legacy or ruin brought in haste?. The enemy of truth is lying there in state.. Another day, another manufactured crisis. keeping the people distracted. There's no one playing by the rules anymore. how will history portray us?. A broken backbone with nothing left to lose. That hate the sight of all the ones that do.. A lasting legacy or ruin brought in haste?. The enemy of truth is lying there in state. A shiny new agenda, birthed from a depraved mind. Of failing us on purpose, to culturally sanitize. Its opiates for the masses under cloak. as hope and change. The new normal or just more of the same?. The perfect plan. Must have an alibi. And the perfect pawn. To spew the party line. Of the perfect falsehood. Spoke a thousand times. The perfect words. Cover the greatest crime. Hell is turning itself inside out. To lead its path up to meet us. And we deliberately take. A step, one foot closer to the grace"

As you are now so once was I. As I am now so you must be. Prepare my friends to follow me. Forgive me father for I have sinned. I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind.

play for blood,"Anybody searching for action. Anything to feel the emptiness inside. Any place that the streets are empty. Any takers wanna pour out their lives. With fire and lighting shooting from my hand. And desolation written across my eyes. My itchy finger on hairpain trigger. My tempers hot and my patience's taken flight. Inside the abattoir. The cover charge is somebody's gotta die. Now, Ihear you screaming out for mercy. Last man that's standing wins the fight. Too late, I see your end zero in on you. Even mortal enemies they can't deny. Let me help you up again. The wings of God surround me. I live to play because i know i'll never die. If i win again, I'm still the champion. And if you win, HA, that's just impossible!. I don't play for keeps; i don't play for your soul. I don't play to win, I don't play for it all. I play for blood.

poison was the cure,I miss the warm embrace I felt. First time you touched me. Secure and safe in open arms. I should have known you'd crush me. A snake you were when we met. I loved you anyway. Pulling out your poisoned fangs. The venom never goes away. Serpent swims free in my blood. Dragons sleeping in my veins. Jackyl speaking with tongue. Roach egg laying in my brain. Once stalked beneath your shadow. Sleepwalking to the gallows. I'm the sun that beats your brow in. Til I finally threw the towel in. Never knowing if I'd wake up in a. Whirlpool got redundant. My brain was just some driftwood. In a cesspool I became dead. From a rock star to a desk fool. Was my destiny someone said. Loves a tidepool. Taste the waters life's abundant. Taste me
poisonous shadows,"How much pain do you need to feel?. How much shame do you have to conceal?. There is no sunshine, just endless nights. Nobody's there, nobody cares when you cry. Is it my face you see, do I haunt you in your sleep. On your hands and knees. when you crawl through your nightmares. When there's no more grace. does your heartbeat start to race?. Clawing everywhere in the dark, poisonous shadows. How many secrets do you keep inside?. How many sins do you have to hide?. The haunting masses have blackened the sun. You'll pay for everything you've done, one by one. Is it my face you see, do I haunt you in your sleep. On your hands and knees. when you crawl through your nightmares. When there's no more grace. does your heartbeat start to race?. Clawing everywhere in the dark, poisonous shadows. It's like, I woke up, and she was right there. I could almost touch her. although she's been gone for years now. I can feel her. I can feel her watching me"

I promise, I promise. There's so many fighting. To get past the Pearly Gates. But nobody ever wants to die or get saved. Their intentions aren't that good. And I can smell the asphalt. That's their personal road to hell being paved. And when we walk down the street. The wind sings our name in rebel songs. But it's much too late when the fear is gone.

I'm left to walk this world alone. Fill solos - Mustaine. In a broken mold they made me. The black sheep of the family. Worth less than zero my opinion. And room temperature IQ. I did something, now I'm nothing. Always wrong with this or that. Poisoned with fear watch it twist. My measly brain mad. Solo - Pitrelli. Talk about me when my bac is turned. Next time we meet it will be to late. The memory burned in my ears of what you said. And now I've got a recipe for hate. Taste it. Fill solos - Mustaine. Dark clouds on the horizon. Make it hard to breathe. A walking mistake but every time. I run away, I just come back for more. The choice is clear I can quit. And fall on my sword or light a fire. To see who runs or stays. And plays the confidence game. Solo - Pitrelli. . ...Warhorse. I'm feeling quite invisible. I feel just like thin air. The truth taunts me. Solo - Mustaine. I see the earth below me. I watch it spinning there. Does someone, somewhere. Out there hear me?. Solo - Pitrelli. Sentenced to walk in Purgatory. My life is running down. I can't believe what they've done to me.

I like the way that you let me in. The way you look when the walls cave in. I like the way that your stomach knots. And how you cry for it all to stop. I like the way that you fool yourself. And make believe there's nobody else. I like the way that you stand in line. And beg salvation from the empty skies. Don't want no revenge. Ain't no pay back time. It ain't called getting even. Here comes the reconing day. I like the things that you try to fake. And your face when I see you break. And that you say you will pray for me. You realize you are prey for me. I like the way you stay on attack. No matter what, I keep coming back. And how you try to hold me down. But you end up driven to the ground."
return to hangar,Welcome to an empty fortress. A mighty wreck that once was proud. Ate alive by oxidation. Abandoned by a crew of cowards. Navigation systems failed. Computers crashed and they all fall down. Possibly I've seen too much. Hangar 18 I know too much. All the guilty paid the price. Suspended by their broken necks. No one survived to tell the story. When foreign life forms resurrect. And military intelligence is. Still two words that can't make sense. Possibly I've seen too much. Hangar 18 I know too much.
rust in peace... polaris,"Tremble you weaklings, cower in fear. I am your ruler, land, sea and air. Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall. I am a nuclear murderer I am Polaris. Ready to pounce at the touch of a button. My system locked in on military gluttons. I rule on land, air and sea. Pass judgement on humanity. Winds blow from the bowels of hell. Will we give warning, only time will tell. Satan rears his ugly head, to spit into the wind. I spread disease like a dog. Discharge my payload a mile high. Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils. Launch the Polaris, the end doesn't scare us. When will this cease. The warheads will all rust in peace. Bomb shelters filled to the brim. Survival such a silly whim. World leaders sell missiles cheap. Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps. High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea. Nuclear winter spreading disease. The day of final conflict. All pay the price. The third world war. Rapes peace, takes life. Back to the start, talk of the part. When the earth was cold as ice. Total dismay as the sun passed away. And the days where black as night. Eradication of Earth's. Population loves Polaris."
set the world afire,"Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky. They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie. All forms of life die now the humans all succumb. Time to kiss your ass goodbye the end has just begun. Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1989. Weeds once underneath your feet have grown into vines. Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face. No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late. The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid they said. And if it comes, the living will envy the dead. Racing for power, and all come in last. No winning first stone cast. This falsehood worldly peace. It's treaties will soon cease. No one will be left to prove that humans existed. Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted. We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke. Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy. and now the final scene, a global darkening. Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruins. Towering overhead both far and wide. There's unknown tools of World War III. Einstein said ""We'll use rocks on the other side"". No survivors set the world afire"
seven,"Dave Mustaine/David Ellefson. Full of greed you sell your soul. Full of pride a heavy load. You eat yourself gluttony. Resent yourself you envy me. Everything turns into wrath. You lust yourself to death. Deep fears that drive us. Hid beneath disguises. Judge the world within. Forgive my deadly sins. Procrastination always giving up. Something better comes to interrupt. Cast your verdict down to me. Spare me your bleeding sympathy. Only care how you appear. Clearly see you can't see clear. Deep fears that drive us. Hid beneath disguises. Judge the world within. Forgive my deadly sins. Greed, gluttony, pride, envy, wrath, sloth, lust, deadly seven. Seven deadly sins of mine. On every street. And corner lie. These seven deadly sins of mine"

The bite of the she-wolf. One look in her lusting eyes. Savage fear in you will rise. Teeth of terror sinking in. The bite of the she-wolf. My desires of flesh obey me. The lioness will enslave me. Another heart beat than my own. Sound of claws on cobblestone. I'm stoned. One look in her lusting eyes. Savage fear in you will rise. Teeth of terror sinking in. The bite of the she-wolf. One look in her lusting eyes. Savage fear in you will rise. Teeth of terror sinking in. The bite of the she-wolf. Beware what stalks you in the night.

sin,"He had an unfamiliar face. Complete life in disarray. A simple man, power drunk. No worries of living, no more anything. Deep inside I've seen it rise. Actions progress to no end. Mirror Mirror please look inside. Do you see the reasons that we sing. Not one to be forgot. Spoled rotten, so they say. Once burned, forever marked. Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay. Pressure coming down. Down on me, gonna break. Broken fingernails. Digging in, scratch my face. Nervous, like a cat. Gonna jump through my skin. Shadows on the wall. Stretching out, grope for me. Reasons, deep in me. let me be. Let me bleed. Set me free. The reasons that we sin."
skin o' my teeth,"Dave Mustaine. I had wrists donning slits. Flowing constantly. My broken body in a wreck. Wrapped around a tree. A crosswalk hit and run. The finish line for me. People clutter in the gutter. Take a look and see. Chorus. No escaping pain. You belong to me. Clinging on to life. By the skin o' my teeth. My blood flows through the streets. Deluge from the wounds. Empty jars of sleeping pills. On the dresser of my room. My wet brain neighbor cranes. His neck to see in time,. The white lights a train. Bearing down on me. Chorus. Solo - Marty. I won't feel the hurt. I'm not trash any longer. That that doesn't kill me. Only makes me stronger. I need a ride to the morgue. That's what 911 is for. So, tag my toe and don't forget.

sleepwalker,"'Sleepwalker'. Music & Lyric Dave Mustaine. I should be calling collect from jail. For the things I commit each night in my head. Like last night in my sleep I got to snuff you. But then I woke up again, safe in my little bed. No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life. I get to force your untimely disappearance. Each night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleep. I close my eyes and you just vanish soon as I. Lay down my head when I'm dead to the whole wide world. No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life. And then I wake up and it was all just a dream. And everything is the same. Sleepwalker – Did I give you concrete shoes?. And throw you off of a bridge. Sleepwalker – When I lay down to sleep. Pray your soul’s mine to keep, I feel you near me. Go to sleep, Sleepwalker. Just taking a stroll; don’t go to sleep! Here’s some toothpicks for your eyes!. You always make an excellent cadaver. I roll your body up in a carpet to make music in the. Trunk of my limousine, wrapped up in a rug. A fitting end, is that I send you up the river like a punk. No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life. The angel of death is pissed off at me again. Just because I got to put you out of my misery. It doesn’t matter, I am without fear. Now you’re dead, I won’t shed another bloody tear for you. No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life. I’m calling down the thunder, then you’ll sleep with the fishes. The answer to all of my wishes. Sleepwalker – Did I tell you I was in movies?. Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch. Sleepwalker – Everyday, another way, I know you can hear me. Solo – Mustaine. Solo – Drover. I think you’d look nice in a Colombian necktie. Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog. No more stupidity from you, as I pull your tongue through. For a smile from ear to ear, now there’s nothing to hear. No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life. And then I wake up and it was all just a dream. And everything is still the same. Sleepwalker – Did I give you concrete shoes?. And throw your body off of a bridge. Sleepwalker – When I lay down to sleep. Pray your soul is mine to keep, I feel you near me. Sleepwalker – Or did I tell you I was in movies?. Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch. Sleepwalker – Everyday, another way, I know you can hear me. Sleepwalker – Did I buy you the farm?. Put a horse head in your bed. Sleepwalker – When I lay down to sleep. Pray your soul is mine to keep, I feel you near me. Sleepwalker – Everyday. Everyday another way. Sleepwalker – When I lay down to sleep. Pray your soul is mine to keep, I know you can hear me.

something that i'm not,"You mind tells you that you've lost your confidence. You're drifting and ya don't believe in anyone. To lose what little you have left to be proud of. Afraid you can't do this again, ah!. You said that nothing come in-between us. The way of getting things we wanted done. Then enissophobia held you under its influence. Until you compromised your style. Everything about you has been one big charade. What will you do now that the well's run dry? Cry?. To sell out all your friends and stab them in the back. It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not. When you forced me into doing what you love. Mark my words no one loves you very much, yeah mark em'. And when you tried to change me and tried to replace me. I couldn't help but end just hating you, hmm!. Being a fraud can only last so long, you should know. Till what ya sensed as a child returns, you little baby. To choke out the voice that told ya “money and the fame”. Would fill the crater that you dug for yourself. Unlike you I'm no vision to myself, lest you forget. You didn't ever make metal, buddy; metal made you. To crush and run over everyone along the way. It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not. A stranger to yourself, ha! ya pissed me off again. I won't be driven by your needs anymore. What you'd become to do or be is clear to see for me. It's something that you are; something that I'm not. It makes me sick to hear you say you “love me”. I know you only love what I can do for you. If you were the one that was leading the charge. Would you notice if I missed a day or two? But that's impossible!. We all laughed at the parodies that you'd become. Now your pain slowly paid back has begun. So, accept my resignation, or in your words “betrayal”. Before it gets much worse, end this self-sabotage. Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not. Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not. Something that you are, something I'm not, yet"
sudden death,"His wicked Highness, born from disaster. To dominate and to kill. A glistening, murder-machine. False majesty, standing perfectly still. A blitzkrieg; raining down evil on a mountain of black ice. Like a good ole fashioned beating within Inches of your life. Alone and left abandoned. With the sentence you've been handed. All your angels will ignore you. As your life flashes before you. Even still you keep on fighting. Through the thunder and the lightning. And now Heaven sends its love. Your sudden death from above. Once frozen like a prisoner depraved. Perched high atop the lithospheres. Set free from beneath the depths of hell. Bequeathing man nothing but despair. The beast is genetically programmed. Time to destroy, time to go berserk. To see the end of all wars, to see the end of the earth. Stopping at nothing, punch-drunk from the blood that he's tasted. Tearing your soul apart. Not one bit of your pain will be wasted. Now death descends upon you. Like a bloody white dove. Bringing your retribution, your sudden death from above. Chorus"

We dance like marionettes. Swaying to the Symphony. Of Destruction. Acting like a robot. Its metal brain corrodes. You try to take its pulse. Before the head explodes. Explodes. (Chorus). Solo - Marty. The earth starts to rumble. World powers fall. A'warring for the heavens. A peaceful man stands tall. Tall. (Chorus)
take no prisoners,"Got on chance, infiltrate them. Get it right, terminate them. The Panzers will, permeate them. Break their pride, denigrate them. And their people, retrograde them. Typhus, detriade them. Epidemic, devastate them. Take no prisoners, cremate them. Going to war, give'em hell. D-Day, next stop Normandie. Beginning of the end. We know how to and sure as shit we'll win. War is peace sure man. A retreat for the damned. A playground for the demented. A heaven for those who walk his world. Bereft of heart and soul. Love and war they say all is fair. Take his life. But won't take his hair. Your body has parts your. Country can spare. By the way son here's. Your wheelchair. He once had to be all he could be. Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see. Funny thing, he's like you and me. It's funny thing, a funny thing. Tears streak his solemn stare. Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares. No one knew what would happen there. No one spoke no one even dared. Don't ask what you can do for your country. Ask what you country can do for you. Take no prisoners, take no shit"
tears in a vial,"This may seem all too confusing. How I could walk away from something so rare. But you see it all got too demanding, yeah. And I just didn't care, I just didn't care, if I cared, if I cared. Lately, I've been left wanting, but not wanting you. Attraction that once was is no longer there, ooh. And it sucks to be taken for granted. When the veil is drawn and there's only air. I had to walk away. Give up something I love. For what I loved even more. And save my tears for you. Everything has lost its meaning; I had to let it go. To find myself, myself, and start something new, brand new. Forced to look deep in the mirror, face who I really am. Now it's just me, cause I can't afford you. I had to walk away. Give up something I love. For what I loved even more. And save my tears for you. I gave up something I loved. For what I loved even more. And I saved my tears for you. In a vial and walked away. You were so beautiful to look upon. I could see the light in your smile. Your eyes were the windows into your soul. Your body was heavenly just like the sky. Until all your good looks betrayed you, which ain't much. Counted on your counterfeit smiles for too long. Your eyes are empty windows: broken. The body may be here, but the soul is gone. I saved my tears for you in a vial. From everything wicked thing that you did, that you said. To send away, buried with your love. So many tears in a vial, now that you're gone, and now that you're dead"

the blackest crow,"This cold, empty house is. So quiet now she's gone. The dust accumulates into. Mountains on the ground. My paper's piled on the steps. Her flowers all have died. I'm searching everywhere. For someone I'll never find. The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away. It's too late, when you've lost your soul. I left her everything, she only left my ring. My world is darker now than the blackest crow. Shadows fill this place. She's been away so long. The wallpaper leaves a stain. Where pictures once belonged. You think I would have known. Something was going on. Her kisses were so cold. Her loving touch withdrawn. The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away. It's too late, when you've lost your soul. I left her everything, she only left my ring. My world is darker now than the blackest crow. They never do teach you how to walk away from someone that you love. The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away. I know t's too late, when you've lost your soul. The fires all but gone, my world is darker now. Than the blackest crow. The blackest crow"

I hear the doctor calling me away. A merciful embalming. I hear the doctor calling me away.

the killing road,"Again we stalk the stage. At mach speed we engage. Feeding people's rage. The big cat's left it's cage. Back in the bus again. To catch another plane. This behavior's quite insane. But we do it for the fame, yeah. I lost my mind, I lost all my money. I lost my life to the killing road. The road will never end. It always starts again. Another show's around the bend.

I got nothing left to lose, but my sanity and the right to go insane. I got nothing left to lose, but my mind. I got nothing left to choose, so I think I'll go insane. My stomach aches from insufficient funds. My cheeks are gaunt, my guts are overdrawn. My head pounds, starvation's given me the shakes. Too much squalor, too much pressure, and now I'm getting pissed. I'm living on the edge, reality is teetering, my mind is on the brink. How will I face the day tomorrow if I can't make it through today?. I got nothing left to lose, but my sanity and the right to go insane. I got nothing left to lose, but my mind. I got nothing left to choose, so I think I'll go insane"
the scorpion,"My life is everything. That feeds my thirsts, that causes sin. My wants are all I care. No shame and guilt. There’s nothing there. Look deep into my veins. I sell deceit, without a trace. Fear not what I can do. Unless you want it done to you. Oh oh. As I climb onto your back. I will promise not to sting. I will tell you what you want to hear. And not mean anything. Then I treat you like a dog. As I shoot my venom in. You pretend you didn’t know. That I am a scorpion. Myself I'm centered in. There's nothing else. There’s never been.

In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon. trapped without a plea. See thing in agony. Necrosis is the fate. Pins sticking through the skin. The venom now sedates. Locked in a pillory. Nowhere to be found. Screaming for your life. But no one hears a sound. Help Me. Prepare the patients scalp. To peel away. Metal caps his ears. He'll hear not what we say. Solid steel visor. Riveted cross his eyes. Iron staples close his jaws. So no one hears his cries. The skull beneath the skin. Now your drawn and quartered. Your bones will make the x. Symbol stands for poison. And it's chained to your head. And as we fold your arms. To make the holy cross. We cross the crucifix. Religion has been lost. The skull beneath the skin

this was my life,"It was just another day. It was just another fight. It was words strung into sentences. It was doomed to not be right. There is something wrong with me. There is something wrong with you. There is nothing left of us. There is one thing I can do. Lying on your bed,. Examining my head. This is the part of me that hates. Paybacks are a bitch. I throw the switch. Somewhere an electric chair awaits. Hey! This was my life. Hey! This was my fate. This was the wrong thing to do. This was the wrong one to be doing. This was the road to destiny. This was the road to my ruin. Now there's motives for the suspect. Now there's nothing left to say. Now there's method to the madness. Now there's society to pay. In our life there's if.

time: the beginning,"Father time, I'm running late. I'm winding down, I'm growing tired. Seconds drift into the night. The clock just ticks till my time expires. You were once my friend. Now I know I can't tie your hands. The days I saved I couldn't spend. They fell like sand through the hourglass. No time to lose, no time to choose. Time taking time, it's taken mine. Scenes of my life seem so unkind. Time chasing time, creeps up behind. I can't run forever, and time waits for no one. Not for me. An enemy I can't defend. My final place. A deadly end.. Life's just a speck in space. Dreams of an eternal resting place. I can't get any younger. Time has brutal hunger. Time taking time, it's taken mine. Scenes of my life seem so unkind. Time chasing time, creeps up behind. I can't run forever, and time waits for no one. Not for me."

In the eye of the tornado, blow me away. You'll grow to loathe my name. You'll hate me just the same. You won't need your breath. And soon you'll meet your death. Not from the years, not from the use. Not from the tears, just self abuse. But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado. I can't replace the lies, that let a thousand days go. No more living trapped inside. In her way I'll surely die. In the eye of the tornado, blow me away. Who's to say, what's for me to say. Who's to say, what's for me to be. Who's to say, what's for me to do. Cause a big nothing it'll be for me. The land of opportunity. The golden chance for me. My future looks so bright. Now I think I've seen the light. Can't say what's on my mind. Can't do what I really feel. In this bed I made for me. Is where I sleep, I really feel. I warn you of the fate. Proven true to late. Your tongue twist perverse. Come drink now of this curse. And now I fill your brain. I spin you round again. My poison fills your head. As I tuck you into bed. You feel my fingertips. You won't forget my lips. You'll feel my cold breath. It's the kiss of death"
train of consequences,I'm doing you a favor. As I'm taking all your money. I guess I should feel sorry. But I don't even trust me. There's bad news creeping up. And you feel a sudden chill. How do you do? My name is Trouble. I'm coming in for the kill.... And you know I will. Set the ball a-rollin. I'll be clicking off the miles. On the train of consequences. My boxcar life o' style. My thinking is derailed. I'm tied up to the tracks. The train of consequences. There ain't no turning back. No horse ever ran as fast. As the money that you bet. I'm blowing all my cards. And I play them to my chest. Life's fabric is corrupt. Shot through with corroded thread. As for me I hocked my brains. Packed my bag and headed West.
trust,"Lost in a dream. Nothing is what it seems. Searching my head. For the words that you said. Tears filled my eyes. As we said our last goodbyes. This sad scene replays. Of you walking away. My body aches from mistakes. Betrayed by lust. We lied to each other so much. That ain't nothing we trust. Time and again. She repeats let's be friends. I smile and say yes. Another truth bends. I must confess. I try to let go, but I know. We'll never end 'til we're dust. We lied to each other again. But I wish I could trust. My body aches from mistakes. Betrayed by lust. We lied to each other so much. That in nothing we trust. God help me please, on my knees. Betrayed by lust. We lied to each other so much. Now there's nothing we trust. (whispered):. 'How could this be happening to me. I'm lying when I say ""trust me"". I can't believe this is true. Trust hurts. Why does trust equal suffering'. My body aches from mistakes. Betrayed by lust. We lied to each other so much. That in nothing we trust. God help me please, on my knees. Betrayed by lust. We lied to each other so much. Now there's nothing we trust. My body aches from mistakes. Betrayed by lust. We lied to each other so much. That ain't nothing we trust. God help me please, on my knees. Betrayed by lust. We lied to each other so much. Absolutely nothing we trust !"
truth be told,"This is the first tale of death in the world. When Cain struck down Abel, a family broken. Since then mankind's dominated his own kind. To insult and injure, there's no such thing as peace. Till death do us part, till the last. Truth be told - Sin lies at the doorway. Truth be told - Hell's open for business now. Truth be told - The soil cries out for revenge. Truth be told - And death is upon the ground. All around. The battle ain't over without spoils of war. Just cause it is written does not make it so. When you dance with the devil wait till the song's over. I ask myself, ""How bad do I want you to live""?. My anger ir near, till the last. Truth be told - Sin lies at the doorway. Truth be told - Hell's open for business now. Truth be told - The soil cries out for revenge. Truth be told - And death is upon the ground. All around. Tribulation strikes and we're hit hard. Still you just go on your way. Head in the sand, ignoring the rain. Just like the flood in Noah's day. In his day. Can't punish those ruining the earth. It's suicide to some degree. Because we are all guilty, guilty as sin. There will be no peace, never for you and me. Before al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Long before Hitler and Hussein. Ever since the first murder was committed. The verdict's always been the same. Been the same, wrong!. The cursed future just repeats the past. There's hell to pay and stones to cast. So, there will be no peace, never be peace. Till the last truth be told by you and me"

use the man,"I heard somebody fixed today. There was no last goodbyes they say. His will to live ran out. I heard somebody turned to dust. Looking back at what he left. A list of plans and photographs. Songs that never will be sung. These are the things he won't get done. I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man. I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands. They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand. I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man. Just one shot to say goodbye. One last taste to mourn and cry. Scores and shoots, the lights go dim. Just one shot to do him in. He hangs his head and wonders why. Why the monkey only lies. But pay the pauper he did choose. He hung his head inside the noose. I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man. I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands. They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand. I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man. Cryptic writing on the wall, the beginning of the end. I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand"

If I ""Ain`t superstitious"" then this won`t mean a thing. But some crazy shit has happened since ""The conjuring"".. Not even close. Not even close. Not even close. To overdose. Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins. a knife right through my heart, I am a victory.. Came ""Anarchy"" to ""Set the world a fire"". Pain of ""Hook in mouth"", ""In my darkest hour"". Corruption of the world ""Peace sells... but. nobody`s buying"". Ignorant religion ""Holy wars"" and dying, yea. ""Tornado"" nearly got me. By the ""Skin of my teeth"". ""This was my life"", ""Foreclosure of my dreams"". May the past ""Rust in peace"" in ""Hangar 18"". And ""Countdown to extinction"". Just be a bad dream. ""Lucrecia"" said.... Not even close. Not even close. Not even close. To overdose. Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins. a knife right through my heart, I am a victory."
vortex,"Internal combustion. Multiple personalities. Terror inside of me. A mask of silent agony. Curse the falling rain. The vortex of pain. As medieval as Merlin. A pact for power was made. Lucifer in transition. It's time the price was paid. Searching the domain. The vortex of pain. A telestic message. Writtin in torment. Howl out dirges. Like the horns of Jericho. Distorted faces. Writhing in rage. Walls of purgatory tumble down. Endless death, the jewels of a crown"
wake up dead,"I sneak in my own house. It's four in the morning. I had too much to drink. Said I was out with the boys. I creep in my bedroom. I slip into bed,. I know if I wake her,. I'll wake up dead. Chorus. I wonder, will she find out,. About the other, other lover.. Diana.. Wake up dead, you die. Wake up dead, and buried.. Wake up dead, you die. Wake up dead.. ."
wanderlust,"Dave Mustaine/Marty Friedman. As sure as the sun rises in the east. Another gunman will come seeking my defeat. Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still. Will he fall like all the rest ending his days upon boothill. I'm an outcast riding into town alone. I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone. I'm an outcast riding into town alone. I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone. As I ride into the sunset to take another town. Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down. The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns. Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns. I'm an outcast riding into town alone. I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone. I'm an outcast riding into town alone. I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone. A drum beats for me, it's louder every day. The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgment day. Life's an endless showdown never knowing when they'll come. I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun. The game I play has caused a lot of grief. They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief. I'm an outcast riding into town alone. I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone. I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand. I got wanderlust lost in no man's land. I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land. I got wanderlust."
washington is next!,"The quiet war has begun with silent weapons. And the new slavery is to keep the people. Poor and stupid, ""Novus Ordo Seclorum"". How can there be any logic in biological war?. We all know this is wrong, but the New World Order's. Beating down the door, oh something needs to be done. There was a king, an evil king. Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams. An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret. Of seven years of famine, the wolf is at my door. As predicted years ago, that that was, that is, that is no more. The word predicts the future and tells the truth about the past. Of how the world leaders will hail the new Pharoah. The eighth false king to the throne; Washington is next!. Disengage their minds, sabotage their health. Promote sex and war, and violence in the kindergartens. Blame the parents and teachers; it's their fault. ""Annuit Coeptis"". Attack the church dynamic, attack the family. Keep the public undisciplined till nothing left is sacred and. The ""have-nots"" get hooked and have to go to the ""haves"". Just to cop a fix. I am the king, an evil king. Who dreams the wickedest of dreams. An ancient mystery, nobody could interpret. Of seven empires falling, the wolf is at my door. As predicted years ago, that that was, that is, that is no more. The word predicts my future and tells the truth about my past. Of how the world's leaders are waiting to usher in. The eighth world power of modern Rome; Washington is next!. There was a king, an evil king. Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams. An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret. Of seven empires falling, the wolf is at my door. As predicted years ago, that that was, that is, that is no more. I am a king and I dream the wildest dreams. And nobody could interpret. Seven empires falling, the wolf is at my door. Ohh, that that was, that is, that is no more. There's something at my door, some ancient mystery. The future tells the truth about the past. And I'm the eighth false king to the throne. I've got you in my crosshairs, now, ain't that a bitch?. Washington, you're next!"
we the people,"Secret bureaucracy, it’s just a lie. The devil’s henchmen, in suit and tie. A sacred brotherhood; an ancient rite. Politicians and the double lives they hide. Violate your rights, no more equality. Surrender freedom, your social security. We, the people face unconstitutional lies. In greed we trust, in revolution we die. Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves. The land of liberty needs a regime change. Until you no longer know right from wrong. The constitution isn’t worth the paper it’s written on. Screams from the future, warn of calamity. The coming plagues of the new disease. The illuminati, one world currency. One world religion, one world everything"
when,"No one hears a word I say. And my prayers are never answered. But you'll never see the pain inside of me. Stabbing me over and over and over. I trusted you and I loved you. And you spit back in my face. How could you do this to me?. When will you stop trying to hurt me?. I've walked a minefield for you. A career in hell with you. I have made it through the things. Others would surely die just watching. And the oath I take on this day. Is to know that you will be repaid. One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl. Until then, until I see your world implode. I wish you death and suffering. Misery to spare. Time to release your pain. Face the last enemy. I am the last thing you will know. The last thing you will see. I see your death surrounding me. I know you, yes I do. I know you. When no words are spoken and please are ignored. Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough?. When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard. The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough?. It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies. A black cloud of indecision compromised your life. When judgement has failed you. When your own heart's impaled you. Your wandering mind has destroyed you. Will you ever know when?. When you give everything and the feeling is gone. All the giving is fake, did you fake enough?. When you take everything and you stay too long. When there's nothing left, did you take enough?."
whose life (is it anyway?),"Ooh, you're just in time to get inside my head. Ooh, the war of words you're underneath my skin. You hate the way I wear my clothes. You hate my friends and where we go. I see you in the shadows. You think you know what's best for me. You hate everything you see in me. Have you looked in a mirror?. Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?. You tell me how to live, but who asked you anyway. Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?. Cost so much more than the price I ain't going pay. You only point out fault; anxiety attack. You running your mouth, you stab me in my back. You hate the way I wear my clothes. You hate my friends and where we go. I see you in the shadows. You think you know what's best for me. You hate everything you see in me. Have you looked in a mirror?. Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?. You tell me how to live, but who asked you anyway. Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?. Cost so much more than the price I ain't going pay. ""Running your mouth, running your mouth"". ""You stab me in my back, anxiety attack"". Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?. You tell me how to live, but who asked you anyway. Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?. Cost so much more than the price I ain't going pay. Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?. You tell me how to live, but who asked you anyway. Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?(3x)"
wrecker,"It doesn’t matter what car you drive, she’ll wreck it. It doesn’t matter where you sleep at night, she’ll wreck it. It doesn’t matter where you go to work. Doesn’t matter where you go to church. Doesn’t matter just bad it hurts, she’ll wreck it. My bleached bones in the desert, it’s all that’s left of me. Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much. Home wrecker. Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can’t be worse than this. Home wrecker. It doesn’t matter what you pretend, she’ll wreck it. It doesn’t matter what you defend, she’ll wreck it. It doesn’t matter how you live your life. Doesn’t matter anymore to your wife. Doesn’t matter even how you die, she’ll wreck that too.

you're dead,When someone becomes nothing to anyone. Wilts feelings have died. Anyone would know it. They set out stick and stones. They say they crossed my bones. I say I don't get mad I get even. before they do.. Spoils go to the victor. I'm dead on time. Your time is going to come. One day I'll dance on your graves. Even if you're buried at sea. Till then till when I exact my revenge. I'll tell them you're dead to me. We're all just trying to hold on to anything. You'd think they'd know that's what we're trying to do. These wounds are invisible. Underneath the dirt I still see the scars. But then when things got bad we spread our wings and fly away. You'll take all your riches in the back of a hearse. Your time is going to come. One day I'll dance on your graves. Even if you're buried at sea. Till then till when I exact my revenge. I'll tell them you're dead to me. . One day I'll dance on your grave. Even if you're buried at sea. Till then till when I exact my revenge. One day I'll dance on your graves. Even if you're buried at sea. Till then till when I exact my revenge. I'll tell them you're dead to me
youthanasia,Who'd believe with the way things are here. We'd be going anywhere telling people. How to live?. Who'd believe we'd spend more. Shippin' drugs and guns. Than to educate our sons? Sorry but. That's what they did. I can't help but think. I can't help but think. I can't help but think. Someone's foresaken you and me. Luck deserted me and the truth. Beat out my brains. Men rise on stepping stones of their. Selves to higher things. I've stepped over lots of bodies on my way. Thanks for the information don't need no. More anything. I can't help but think. I can't help but think. I can't help but think. Someone's foresaken you and me. We are the damned of all the world. With saddness in our hearts. The wounded of the wars. We've been hung out to dry. You didn't want us anyway. And now we're making up our minds. You tell us how to run our lives. We run for youthanasia. Solo. We are the damned of all the world. With saddness in our hearts. The wounded of the wars. We've been hung out to dry. You didn't want us anyway. And now we're making up our minds. You tell us how to run our lives. We run for youthanasia. We are the damned of all the world. With saddness in our hearts. The wounded of the wars. We run for youthanasia
