if i ever feel better,"Phoenix - If I Ever Feel Better. They say an end can be a start. Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive. It's like a bad day that never ends. I feel the chaos around me. A thing I don't try to deny. I'd better learn to accept that. There are things in my life that I can't control. They say love ain't nothing but a sore. I don't even know what love is. Too many tears have had to fall. Don't you know I'm so tired of it all. I have known terror dizzy spells. Finding out the secrets words won't tell. Whatever it is it can't be named. There's a part of my world that's fading away. You know I don't want to be clever. To be brilliant or superior. True like ice, true like fire. Now I know that a breeze can blow me away. Now I know there's much more dignity. In defeat than in the brightest victory. I'm losing my balance on the tight rope. Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please.... If I ever feel better. Remind me to spend some good time with you. You can give me your number. When it's all over I'll let you know. Hang on to the good days. I can lean on my friends. They help me going through hard times. But I'm feeding the enemy. I'm in league with the foe. Blame me for what's happening. I can't try, I can't try, I can't try.... No one knows the hard times I went through. If happiness came I miss the call. The stormy days ain't over. I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost. Now I've watched all my castles fall. They were made of dust, after all. Someday all this mess will make me laugh.

If I ever feel better. Remind me to spend some good time with you. You can give me your number. When it's all over I'll let you know. It's like somebody took my place. I ain't even playing my own game. The rules have changed well I didn't know. There are things in my life I can't control. I feel the chaos around me. A thing I don't try to deny. I'd better learn to accept that. There's a part of my life that will go away. Dark is the night, cold is the ground. In the circular solitude of my heart. As one who strives a hill to climb. I am sure I'll come through I don't know how. They say an end can be a start. Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive. I'm losing my balance on the tight rope.

No more coral on the atoll. Something 'bout how hard you learned. Kamikaze in a hopeless world. Do you remember the last time you laughed. And I laughed and you left and I left?.

Yeah I'm just calling to say. How can I sleep when you're wide awake?. Telefono. Ringing for me. Can I tell you?. I dream in stereo. In a studio. Far far away. I might lose you. To some executive. Telefono. Ringing for me. Can I tell you?. I dream in stereo. And in a studio. Far far away. I'm here solo. In Passoscuro"
the real thing,"[Verse 1]. They say that you don't. You promised you will. I'm calling my number. To sort out the thrill. [Chorus]. Almost, almost, almost the real thing. How could I have missed that one?. How could I have missed it?. Am I the only one. Your Lancelot?. Twenty-year-old and bored. Run for a better future. Pour lava in the ocean. Drown into the throne that you sit on. Follow, follow, follow me. Holy Father and Son. It's not enough for you to live on. So long, so long Salomé. Tell me that's what you wanted. Follow follow me. Follow me. [Verse 2]. You're more than I want. I figured you will. Back in September. We'll make it a deal. Almost, almost, almost the real thing. How could I have missed that one?. How could I have missed it?. Am I the only one. Your Lancelot?. 20 years often bored. Run for a better future. Pour lava in the ocean. Turn the eternal carousel on. Follow, follow, follow me. Holy father and son. It's odd enough for you to live on. So long, so long Salomé. Tell me that's what you wanted. Follow, follow me"
ti amo,"I don't like it as it is. A disaster scenario. So don't look at what you did. This melted Gelato. Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!. It's not love but wait.

too young,"Baby when I saw you turning at the end of the street. I knew a time was gone and it took me like ages. Just to understand that I was afraid to be a simple guy. I tried my best to smile, but deep inside my heart. I felt it was shouting like a crowd dancing. I guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it is. Can't you hear me calling, oh. Everybody's dancing, oh. Tonight everything is over. I feel too young. I can't lie on my bed without thinking I was wrong. But when that feeling calls this world becomes another. Night time won't hold me in your arms again. I got a very good friend who says. He can't believe the love I give is not enough to end your fears. I guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it is. Can't you hear me calling oh. Everybody's shaking oh. Tonight everything is over. I feel too young. Oh rain falls and hard times coming, they won't leave me tonight. I wish I knew what I was doing. Just do let this spirit survive. Everybody's dancing oh. I guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it is. Can't you hear me calling oh. Everybody's dancing oh. Tonight everything is over. I feel too young"
