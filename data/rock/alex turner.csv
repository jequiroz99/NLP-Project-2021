glass in the park,"There's glass in the park. Darling, I can't help but keep making appointments. to sweep beneath the climbing frame. If the sun's in your eyes. I'll tighten your blindfold, baby. Don't worry your foot won't get cut. Strut carelessly. And when you say that you need me tonight. I can't keep my feelings in disguise. The white parts of my eyeballs illuminate. And I'll wait for you. As if I'm waiting for a storm to stop. I've heard them talking. About how I'm gonna put you off. There's glass in the park. And now that I'm up off my knees. I've picked up the speed. To jump your palaces. And I shoot through the night. And suddenly all those once lost concoction's froth. And chase the day away. When you say that you need me tonight. I can't keep my feelings in disguise. The white part of my eyeballs illuminate. And I'll wait for you. As if I'm waiting for the storm to stop. I've heard them talking. About how I'm gonna put you off. Tell me, how can I put you off. When you're a matter of urgency?. I've got a million things that I need to do. But they're all secondary. Make sure you're not followed. And meet me by the death balloon. Paraselene woman, I'm your man on the moon. And like a grain of diamond dust, you float. And my devotion's outer crust cracks"
hiding tonight,"Tomorrow I'll be quicker. I'll stare into the strobe light flicker. And afloat I'll stay. But I'm quite alright hiding today. Tomorrow I'll be faster. I'll catch what I've been chasing after. And have time to play. I'm quite alright hiding today. And I will play the coconut shy. Win a prize even if it's rigged. I won't know when to stop. And you can leave off my lid, and I won't even lose my fizz. I'll be the polkadots tie. I'll know the way back, if you know the way. But if you are, I'm quite alright, hiding today. Tomorrow I'll be stronger, running colourful. No longer just in black and white. And I'm quite alright hiding tonight. And I will have a game on the coconut shy. Win a prize even if it's rigged. I won't know when to stop. And you can leave off my lid, and I won't even lose my fizz. I'll be the polkadots tie. I'll probably swim through a few lagoons. I'll have a spring in my step. And I'll get there soon. To sing you a happy tune, tomorrow. And you better bring a change of clothes. So we can sail our laughing pianos along a beam of light. But I'm quite alright. Hiding tonight"
it's hard to get around,"It's like you're trying to get to heaven in a hurry. And the queue was shorter than you thought it would be. And the doorman says, ""you need to get a wristband"". You've got to lift between the pitfalls. But you're looking like you're low on energy. Did you get out and walk to ensure you'd miss the quicksand. Looking for a new place to begin. Feeling like it's hard to understand. But as long as you still keep pepperin' the pill. You'll find a way to spit it out, again. And even when you know the way it's gonna blow. It's hard to get around the wind.. Stretching out the neck on your evening. Trying to even out some deficit. But it's saber tooth multi-ball confusion. And you can shriek until you're hollow. Or whisper it the other way. Trying to save the youth without putting your shoes on. Looking for a new place to begin. Feeling like it's hard to understand. But as long as you still keep pepperin' the pill. You'll find a way to spit it out, again. And even when you know the way it's gonna blow. It's hard to get around the wind.. I can hear you through my window. But I'm never quite sure who is who. But they want the world on a dessert spoon. It always sounds like they're fightin'. Or as if that's what they're about to do. It might not hurt now but it's going to hurt soon"
piledriver waltz,"I etched the face of a stopwatch. On the back of a raindrop. And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass.. I heard an unhappy ending it sort of sounds. like you leaving. I heard the piledriver waltz,. It woke me up this morning.. You look like you've been for breakfast. At the heartbreak hotel. And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets. And the literature on how to lose.. Your waitress was miserable and so was your food.. If you're gonna try and walk on water. Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes.. Mysteries flashing amber go green. When you answer but the red on. The rest of the questionnaire never changes.. I heard the news that you're planning. To shoot me out of a cannon.. I heard the piledriver waltz,. It woke me up this morning.. You look like you've been for breakfast. At the heartbreak hotel. And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets. And the literature on how to lose.. Your waitress was miserable and so was your food.. If you're gonna try and walk on water. Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes.. Oh, piledriver"
stuck on the puzzle,"I'm not the kind of fool. Who's gonna sit and sing to you,. About stars, girl.. But last night I looked up into. The dark half of the blue,. And they'd gone backwards.. Something in your magnetism. Must have pissed them off,. Forcing them to get an early night.. I have been searching from. The bottom to the top,. For such a sight. As the one I caught when I saw your.... Fingers dimmed in the lights. Like your used to being told that you're trouble. And I spent all night. Stuck on the puzzle. Nobody I asked. Knew how he came to be the one. To whom you surrendered. Any man who wasn't led away. Into the other room. Stood pretending. But something in your magnetism. Hadn't just made him drop. Whoever's hand it was that he was holding.. I have been searching. From the bottom to the top,. For such a sight. As the one I caught when I saw your.... Fingers dimmed in the lights,. Like your used to being told that you're trouble,. And I spent all night,. Stuck on the puzzle.. I tried to swim to the side,. But my feet got caught in the middle,. And I thought I'd seen the light,. But oh, no.. I was just stuck on the puzzle.. Stuck on the puzzle."
stuck on the puzzle (intro),"I'm not the kind of fool who's gonna sit. And sing to you about stars, girl.. But last night I looked up into the dark half of. The blue and they'd gone backwards."
