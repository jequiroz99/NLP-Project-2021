'Cos we're just passing through. And it ain't what you don't, but it is what you do. Soon as time comes and goes. Soon on the verge of who knows. A sound we're dancing around. Turn up the music and drown. Did we ever find a way to steer. Through the cold light of day?. 'Cos we're just passing through. And it ain't what you don't, but it is what you do. Let's go, let's go.

flick of the finger,"Woke up this morning, I was laid out flat on the dark side. With the moon and the room on the wrong side. I took a needle, sewn myself right back at the seams.

Don't be deceived when our revolution. Has been finally stamped out and they pat you eternally. On the shoulder and say that there? s no inequality worth. Speaking of and no more reason for fighting. Because if you believe them. They will be completely in charge in their marble homes. And granite banks. From which they rob the people of the world. Under the pretense of bringing them culture. Watch out, for as soon as it pleases them. They'll send you out to protect their gold in wars. Whose weapons, rapidly developed by servile scientists. Will become more and more deadly. Until they can with a flick of the finger. Tear a million of you to pieces"

wind up dream,"If tonight is all we have. Then make the bed with sheets of glass. Let’s take it out for one last laugh. Come on, come on. If yesterdays is all we got. We tie our bones in one big knot. Squeeze it out ’til every drop. Is all gone, all gone. Come on. It’s just a wind up dream. So don’t wake me up. ‘Cause I like what I see. With my eyes shut. Whooo!. Solid gold gleams in your eye. A cheeky grin that really makes me smile. The world will want a bit. The world will want a bit. It’s just a wind up dream. So don’t wake me up. ‘Cause I like what I see. With my eyes shut"
world outside my room,"Wake up smiling in my little Eden. Pay no heed to the world outside. Take my medication and hide. Who's been smoking cherry cola. Somebody trying to live the dream. I rattle as I reach to dust the screen. Out the door it might be snowing. In my world it's always June. I don't believe in the world outside my room. Television and dusty window. Fill my head with a happy tune. I don't believe in the world outside my room. I don't believe in the world outside my room. Life in here is a different tempo. Virtually comatose. Sitting with the one I love the most. The sleeping dog deserves to lie. She don't feel like a walk today. She just wants to sleep and play. Out the door it might be snowing. In my world it's always June. I don't believe in the world outside my room. Television and dusty window. Fill my head with a happy tune. I don't believe in the world outside my room. I don't believe in the world outside my room. Tell me something I know already. No surprises for me today. I'm not ready, I've lost my way. Someday soon I'll get up my sofa. Stop dreaming about I might have been. Until then I stay serene"
