brother (feat. gavin degraw),Ramblers in the wilderness. we can't find what we need. Get a little restless from the searching. Get a little worn down in between. Like a bull chasing the matador. is the man left to his own schemes. Everybody needs someone. beside em' shining like a. lighthouse from the sea. Brother let me be your shelter. I'll never leave you all alone. I can be the one you call. When you're low. Brother let me be your fortress. When the night winds are driving on. Be the one to light the way. Bring you home. Face down in the desert. now there's a cage locked. around my heart. I found a way to drop the. keys where my failures were. Now my hands can't. reach that far. I ain't made for rivalry. I could never take the world alone. I know that in my weakness I am stronger. It's your love that brings me home. Brother let me be your shelter. I'll never leave you all alone. I can be the one you call. When you're low. Brother let me be your fortress. When the night winds are driving on. Be the one to light the way. Bring you home. And when you call and need me near. Sayin' where'd you go?. Brother I'm right here. And on those days when the sky begins to fall. You're the blood of my blood. We can get through it all. Brother let me be your shelter. Never leave you all alone. I can be the one you call. When you're feeling low. Brother let me be your fortress. When the night winds are driving on. Be the one to light the way. Bring you home. Brother let me be your shelter. Never leave you all alone. I can be the one you call. When you're low. Brother let me be your fortress. When the night winds are driving on. Be the one to light the way. Bring you home
forever on your side (with johnnyswim),"I wont pretend that we can control the night. Or what kind of road were on. Or where we will see the light. But right now Im talking to ya. Im looking into your eyes. Right now Im trying to show ya. That were gonna be alright. Oh I dont know whats around the bend. Oh, all I know is that my love, it knows no end. All these pieces they fall in line. Because Im forever on your side. Take my hand when you cant see the light. Cause Im forever on your side. I will carry you every time. Because Im forever on your side. Oh Im forever on your side. Theyll beat you up. But dont let em keep you down. Youre always tough enough. And Ill always be around. Oh I cant promise that a day will never come. Where the ground beneath us falls out and we got no where to run. Oh but you wont be alone when the water starts to rise up. No you wont be alone my darling when the rains come"
a place only you can go,"Pain is alive in a broken heart. The past never does go away. We were born to love and we’re born to pay. The price for our mistakes. Grace, she comes with a heavy load. Memories, they can’t be erased. Like a pill I swallow that makes me well. But leaves an awful taste. Oh I know this song won’t do. Enough to prove my love to you. In my heart you’ll always know. There is a place only love can go. There is a place only you can go. Take my notions and words to heart. This is the cry of a man. I can’t bring you fortune or noble life. But I’ll love you all I can. Oh I know this song won’t do. Enough to prove my love to you. But in my heart you’ll always know. There is a place only you can go.. Oh I know this song won’t do. Enough to prove my love to you. In my heart you’ll always know. There is a place only love can go. There is a place only you can go"
again,"I won't be the circus for you to star in. I won't leave you roses to watch them die. You won't be the heartache that keeps me sleepless. You won't be the songs that I could never write. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall. I don't want to have to see you leave me. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love. Maybe I'm a fake, maybe you're a lie. Maybe our last chance died with last night. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love with you again. I won't be a fortress for you to hide in. I won't be the first one you think to call. You won't be the regrets that I can't live with. And we won't be the last ones to ever have to lose it all. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall. I don't want to have to see you leave me. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love. Maybe I'm a fake, maybe you're a lie. Maybe our last chance died with last night. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love with you again. When we're scared and lonely. We will tell ourselves we're only. Just a word from what we needed. But we know that this ain't right. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall. I don't want to have to see you leave me. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love. Maybe I'm a fake, maybe you're a lie. Maybe our last chance died with last night. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love with you again. I can't stay. I can't fall for you again"
drive all night,I ain't lookin for a free ride home. Back to the middle. I need a new locale. I need a girl who calls me baby. I need to know if she can save me. I need somewhere i can drive all night. Out into the darkness. Follow the headlights down. I gotta know if they can take me. I gotta know if they can save me. Focus in on every word. Change my path. Maybe i could leave a mark. Try and prove the poets wrong. There must be time. Maybe we could be the song. To march us on. I ain't lookin for a free ride home. Back to the middle. I need a new locale. I need a girl that calls me baby. I need to know if she can save me. I need somewhere i can drive all night. Out into the darkness. Follow the headlights down. I need to know where they can take me. I gotta know if they can save me. Beg the book to turn the page. Cause i get stuck where the villains get away. Somewhere in this wretched tale there must be a line. Where the victim gets his way. Just one time. I'll get mine. I ain't lookin for a free ride home. Back to the middle. I need a new locale. I need a girl that calls me baby. I gotta know if she can save me. I need somewhere i can drive all night. Out into the darkness. Follow the headlights down. I need to know where they can take me. I gotta know if they can save me. Drive all night. Hold on tight. Close your eyes. Say goodbye
bridges burn,"Its time for moving on. Theres some things you cant forget. Sinking us like a stone. I just wanna bury it. I wanna watch all my bridges burn. Stand in the rain till a page is turned. Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned. I wanna leave everything that hurts. Never go back to the way we were. Set it on fire, baby watch it burn, watch it burn. Out into the unknown. We traded in our regrets. Not gonna go alone. Cause were gonna finish this. Burn it all, set me free. And let the smoke blow on out, to the sea. I need to find somewhere I can believe. I need to know theres a chance we could be"

difference maker,"Isn't it amazing how a man can find himself alone. Call into the darkness for an answer that's he's never known. Isn't it amazing how a God can take a broken man. Let him find a fortune let him ruin it with his own two hands. And he walks on up the hill. On the rock on which he stands. He looks back at the crowd. And he looks down at his hands and he says. I am a difference maker. I am the difference maker. I am the only one that speaks to him. I am the friendliest of friends of God. Isn't it amazing how a man can find himself alone. Call into the darkness for an answer that's he's never known. And he walks on up the hill. On the rock on which he stands. He looks back at the ground. And he looks down at his hands and he says. I am a difference maker. I am the difference maker. I am the only one that speaks to him. I am the friendliest of friends of God. I am on the fence about nearly everything I've seen. And I have felt the fire be put out by too much gasoline. We're all strangers passing through, place and time, afternoon. Life is but a vision in a window that we're peeking through. It's a helpless conversation with a man who says he cares a lot. It's a hopeless confrontation about who might throw a punch or not. And we are all transgressors, we're all sinners, we're all astronauts. So if you're beating death then raise your hand but shut up if you're not. I am the difference maker. I am the only one that speaks to him. I am the friendliest of friends of God. I am the difference maker. I am the only one that speaks to him. I am the friendliest of friends of God"

streets of gold,I want you to know. I’m leaving to let you go. One day we’ll walk upon. Streets of gold. I don’t remember seeing fear in your eyes. When you were fading. The day we said our goodbyes. It’s easy to say that there’s a reason for this. Much harder to know. That what we say is true. Everything we hold could someday slip away. I want you to know. I’m leaving to let you go. And someday we’ll walk upon. The streets of gold. Running through your veins was a slow-ticking clock. Counting down the days. And no one could make it stop.

what you've done to me,"I’m finally broken, falling too far. Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars. With twilight approaching all that I’ve seen. I could never get over what you’ve done to me.

I’m finally broken, falling too far. Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars. With twilight approaching all that I’ve seen. I could never get over what you’ve done to me. I thought that love was just a song we made up. Some kind of chant to make us strong. But when she left me with a word. I knew that I had never been so wrong. Finally broken, falling too far.

a place only you can go,"Pain is alive in a broken heart. The past never does go away. We were born to love and we’re born to pay. The price for our mistakes. Grace, she comes with a heavy load. Memories, they can’t be erased. Like a pill I swallow that makes me well. But leaves an awful taste. Oh I know this song won’t do. Enough to prove my love to you. In my heart you’ll always know. There is a place only love can go. There is a place only you can go. Take my notions and words to heart. This is the cry of a man. I can’t bring you fortune or noble life. But I’ll love you all I can. Oh I know this song won’t do. Enough to prove my love to you. But in my heart you’ll always know. There is a place only you can go.. Oh I know this song won’t do. Enough to prove my love to you. In my heart you’ll always know. There is a place only love can go. There is a place only you can go"
able,"There’s a host of hurts we come across. None of which alike. From the air inside the birthing room. To the darkness where we die. Though I feel I’m just as strong as any man I know. I’m not able on my own. Carry round the secrets. Only heaven knows. Crawl into our darkened rooms where only victims go. Though I feel I’m strong enough to carry all this load. I’m not able on my own. All my actions, false or true. Selfish motives I will use. We were born with knives in hand. Trained to kill our fellow man. If we’re not better than the rest. How will children do their best. Find your patience, find your truth. Love is all we have to lose. I’m not able on my own"
again,"I won't be the circus for you to star in. I won't leave you roses to watch them die. You won't be the heartache that keeps me sleepless. You won't be the songs that I could never write. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall. I don't want to have to see you leave me. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love. Maybe I'm a fake, maybe you're a lie. Maybe our last chance died with last night. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love with you again. I won't be a fortress for you to hide in. I won't be the first one you think to call. You won't be the regrets that I can't live with. And we won't be the last ones to ever have to lose it all. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall. I don't want to have to see you leave me. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love. Maybe I'm a fake, maybe you're a lie. Maybe our last chance died with last night. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love with you again. When we're scared and lonely. We will tell ourselves we're only. Just a word from what we needed. But we know that this ain't right. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall. I don't want to have to see you leave me. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love. Maybe I'm a fake, maybe you're a lie. Maybe our last chance died with last night. I don't want to stay, I don't want to fall in love with you again. I can't stay. I can't fall for you again"
angel at my door,"What do I got to do to my love to make you understand me. Where do I find the piece of your heart to keep you satisfied. What do I got to do to my love to make you even notice. Where do I find the words in my mouth to cut through the air tonight. Cause every day I know that I am learning. And age it ain’t the only thing in life. But if memory’s all you have then I can’t find you. Beneath those eyes. So we open up the door. Let the music take you further than before. We open up the door. Cause maybe there’s an angel standing on the porch. How do I face the man that I am when my heart’s still in hiding. Staring me down, the days of my life that I’ve gotta justify. Maybe I need the cracks in my skin, emotions are hard to carry. Maybe I need the strength in your eyes to cut through the morning time. Cause every day I know that I am learning. And age it ain’t the only thing in life. But if memory’s all you have then I can’t find you beneath those eyes. So we open up the door. Let the music take us further than before. We open up the door.

I am a difference maker. I am the difference maker. I am the only one that speaks to him. I am the friendliest of friends of God. Isn't it amazing how a man can find himself alone.

It's a helpless conversation with a man who says he cares a lot. It's a hopeless confrontation about who might throw a punch or not. And we are all transgressors, we're all sinners, we're all astronauts. So if you're beating death then raise your hand but shut up if you're not. I am the difference maker.

So tell me you’re strong, tell me you see. I need to hear it, will you promise me to. Keep your eyes open, my love. Just past the circumstance. The first light… a second chance.

I know pain is just a place. The will has been broken. Don’t let the fear become the hate. Don’t take the sadness to the grave. I know the fight is on the way. When the sides have been chosen. Cause if you never leave home, never let go. You’ll never make it to the great unknown. Open up your eyes. Keep your eyes open. So tell me you’re strong, tell me you see.

knew it all,"Don’t look back now,. we thought we had it won.. And all that we’ve left,. Is the smoking of a gun,. Fear is not the only device,. That loneliness could leave us to fight.. (Chorus).

My eyes have seen,. The favor move from you to me,. Fear is not the only device,. That loneliness could leave us to fight.. (Chorus). Cause you’re gone (gone, gone). I told myself you could be the one,. But you’re gone (gone, gone). And I knew it all...,. Oooooh, It’s alright, it’s alright (x4). Cause you’re gone (gone, gone). I told myself you could be the one,.

lay' em down,Come down to the river. Come and let yourself in. Make good on a promise. To never hurt again. If you're lost and lonely. Broken down. Bring all of your troubles. And come lay 'em down. All you sinners. And the weak at heart. All the helpless. On the boulevards. Wherever you are now. Whatever evil you've found. Bring all of your troubles. And come lay 'em down. We're all tied to the same old failings. Finding shelter in things we know. We're all dirty like corrupted small towns. We'll bring our troubles. We'll bring our troubles. Come lay 'em down. All you rich men. And the high above. All those with. And without love. All you burdened. And turned around. Bring all of your troubles. Come lay 'em down

let us love,"Let Us Love. We were born to embrace not accept it. We were given nothing more until we kept it. As the color of our boots keep fading. Live a life that we hate without saying. Who would listen to the cries of a poor man. Never done nothing. How can we be something. Every heart has an hour of existence. Every breath brings a chance for redemption. If somehow we could Wake Up!. Let us love (like we were children). Make us feel (like we're still living). in a world I know is burning to the ground. It is time (to beat the system). Live this life (like we can't miss it). In a world I know is burning to the ground. In the crowd of the dead and disappointed. We're ashamed given up on what we wanted. Take a chance on a long shot this time. Aren't we all just at least worth another try. I'm a king in the land of abuses. Under my law the promise of excuses. Whose to win if we know that it's not fair. Who would fight when it seems that no one cares. If somehow we could Wake Up!. Let us love (like we were children). Make us feel (like we're still living). in a world I know is burning to the ground. It is time (to beat the system). Live this life (like we can't miss it). In a world I know is burning to the ground. It's hard to stay here but where do we go?. I know I can't feel it anymore. It's true, time is wearing us down. Before mother and brother will wait. Waiting for our ways to change. Let us love (like we were children). Make us feel (like we were living). in a world I know is burning to the ground. We are hurtin' on the road behind you. Let the wind go with you till the morning come. Yeah your sorrow, no it can't save you. It won't answer for what you've done. . Carlitos.eiji"

looks like love,"Take another step. Don’t give up on me just yet. We could take a chance. We could find a child’s romance. At least we’d love until we can’t. I wont run when it looks like love.

Marching left, right, left, another step. Keep smiling as you go.. Movin’ on. Movin’ on. I’m sick of good intentions how they always tend to drown.. But, then, nothing seems to stay afloat living in the saddest town.. When the curtain falls for one last time and closes out the show.. Marching left, right, left, another step. Keep smiling as you go.. Movin’ on. Movin’ on. Movin’ on. Movin’. You’re out of room for marking days on the wall. The lines remind of just how long I’ve been gone. You’re holding on but now it’s time to let go.. Just let it go.. Movin’ on. Movin’ on. Movin’ on. Movin’ on. We could be the story that’ll break your heart.. We could be the victim of a fall apart.. Maybe we could last another week or so.. Movin’ on baby means you gotta let it go."

oohs and ahhs,"Take me back to a simpler time. I never knew the difference. And the words were mine. Another man could take it all in his stride. My tracks have left a stain.

We got oohs, we got ahhs. We got everything a man could need. We got oohs, we got ahhs. Still got a mountain full of mouths to feed. Tear the ocean and the skies apart. Circle up the wagons underneath the stars. Watch us spin around like a meteorite. It goes down and down and down. Cause in our hearts we know it’s true…. We got oohs, we got ahhs. We got everything a man could need. We got oohs, we got ahhs. Still got a mountain full of mouths to feed. Flashing the lights. Drawing us in. Flashing the lights. And then do it again. Flashing the lights. As the sirens call. Drawing us in. So they can watch us fall. We got oohs, we got ahhs. We got everything a man could need. We got oohs, we got ahhs. Still got a mountain full of mouths to feed"

Don’t look now ‘cause I can’t escape. I get so restless. We won’t know until it’s too late. But I’ll have years to think of. The way I’d do the things I did. Just to chase the pain away. We’re here now and I can change. But I’m still restless. Push, the urge away. To wake up feeling just the same as yesterday. Time, it heals the pain. But painful is the angry heart when time remains. We’re just tired of walking through the faceless crowd. We keep our lonely eyes locked on the ground. And if my legs could run me into you. Then we might know, we might know. Don’t look now ‘cause I can’t escape. I get so restless. We won’t know until it’s too late. But I’ll have years to think of. The way I’d do the things I did. Just to chase the pain away. We’re here now and I can change. But I’m still restless"
return,It’s hard enough to know. That something’s made us not the same. Did I give all I could give. Or spend all I could spend in vain. We were holding on the line. Waiting for the sun to rise.

Waiting for the sun to rise. But we could not believe. The sunlight never crossed our eyes. I’m giving you my heart to break again. Oh I’m leaving you a way to get back in. Return to me. Every heart goes down and every fire goes out. When we don’t hurt anymore. I know it’s all my fault that you’re behind this wall. But I’ll be here when you break it.. When you let it down.. Return to me. I’m giving you my heart to break again
second chances,"All my past is color. Placed inside my hands. Empty is the canvas. Patiently I plan. Stars are bright above me. That’s not where I am. Greens will be behind me. Blues will make the man. I can’t help but fear I’ve done this wrong. Cause seldom second chances come along. Greys are all around me. Fading into black. Stars were bright above me. Won’t you bring them back. I can’t help but fear I’ve done this wrong. Cause seldom second chances come along. If time can break us, will it make us strong. Cause seldom second chances come along"

And someday we’ll walk upon. The streets of gold. Running through your veins was a slow-ticking clock. Counting down the days. And no one could make it stop.

the heart,Ain't no gift like the present tense. Ain't no love like an old romance. Got'sta make hay when the sun is shinin'. Can't waste time when it comes time to dance. Slammin' this door with a heavy hand. Signin' this line like a deed to land. Keeping in touch with the windows down. Dreading this night since the rain hit the ground. Long live the heart. Long live the soul. That knows what it wants. That piece you can find. That part is the whole. It never lets go. Always tryin to be the one outlaw. Goes where he wants never does get caught. Pushing this line like the lord ain't comin'. Building this house like they're scared of something else. Be my winter in this living hell. Be my one last dying wishing well. Oh well. Long live the heart. Long live the soul. That knows what it wants. That piece you can find. That part is the whole. It never lets go. Got'sta make hay when the sun is shinin. Can't waste time when it comes time to dance. Keeping in touch with the windows down. Dreading this night since the rain hit the ground. Long live the heart. Long live the soul. That knows what it wants. That piece you can find. That part is the whole. It never lets go. Long live the heart. Long live the soul

the reckoning,Goin' to California. Suitcase in my hand. Never run away a boy. When you can walk away a man. Pride it comes to find you. In your hopes and in your dreams. Like a thief who tells his lover. He's got one last thing. Cause I can see the shadows. At the foot of my door. I can see the faces. They don't doubt us anymore. I can see it coming. I pray I don't go blind. In the middle of our reckoning time. Easy is a refuge. And it's an easy place to be. But when the sun shines on us. What will the whole world think. Cause I can see the shadows. At the foot of my door. I can see the faces. They don't doubt us anymore. I can see it coming. I pray I don't go blind. In the middle of our reckoning time.

through smoke,Before the truth will come to fill our eyes. The wool comes down in the form of fire. And when the answers and the truth have cut their ties. Will you still find me. Will you still see me through smoke. I was born in a house in a town just like your own. I was raised to believe in the power of the unknown. When the answers and the truth have cut their ties. Will you still find me. Will you still see me through smoke. Who do you believe when you can't get through. When everything you know seems so untrue. When I'm lost in a place that I thought I knew. Give me some way that I might find you

valley of tomorrow,"I am a troubled mind, I am a calloused heart. A failing engine from driving way too hard. Trying way too hard. I pulled a 38 out of my bleeding heart. I killed my selfishness for bringing me this far. This far away from you. When the daylight breaks through the buildings of Chicago. I will stand alone in the valley of tomorrow. Oh, this is the way I wanna go down. (This is the last time) I'm starting over with you. This is the way I wanna go out. I never second-guesssed the little voice I heard.

we could run away,Everything stops as we look towards the clock. It feels like we?re moving backwards. It?s easy to find potential in before. But we look the same in the afters. Could we wait long enough to bide my time. Could we stay and say enough to change my mind. We could run away. Maybe we could change. Get back on our feet and then. Maybe make it home again. We could run away. Be on our own again. Maybe in the twilight. We can break out. Buy ourselves a Cadillac. Never turn around. We could run away. Be on our own again. We could stay here where things became unclear. Fighting what?s left of the right way. But everyone hates the chances that we waste. Under the light of the new day. Could we wait long enough to bide my time. Could we stay and say enough to change my mind. We could run away. Maybe we could change. Get back on our feet and then. Maybe make it home again. We could run away. Be on our own again. Maybe in the twilight. We can break out. Buy ourselves a Cadillac. Never turn around. We could run away. Be on our own again
what you've done to me,"I’m finally broken, falling too far. Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars. With twilight approaching all that I’ve seen. I could never get over what you’ve done to me.

I’m finally broken, falling too far. Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars. With twilight approaching all that I’ve seen. I could never get over what you’ve done to me. I thought that love was just a song we made up. Some kind of chant to make us strong. But when she left me with a word. I knew that I had never been so wrong. Finally broken, falling too far. Burned up in pieces from chasing your stars. With twilight approaching all that I’ve seen. I could never get over what you’ve done to me. I’m finally broken, falling too far.
