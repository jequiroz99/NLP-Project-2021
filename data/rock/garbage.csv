The sea is wide. The streets are long. And there's blood on all our hands. And the cat is gone. And only what's left to us. Is history built on dust. There was sweat on a cold source. Of missions and governments. Supplies and victories. Good girl and king to please. The still keys are everywhere. In a thousand yard stare. We all end up the same. Like little lambs to meet their end. . I'm Really Into Techno. So... What kind of music do you listen to?. I'm really into techno. I'm really into techno... and that's about it. By Xélica
as heaven is wide,"Nothing that you say will release you. Nothing that you pray would forgive you. Nothing's what your words mean to me. Something that you did will destroy you. Something that you said will stay with me. Long after you're dead and gone. CHORUS:. If flesh could crawl my skin would fall. From off my bones and run away from here. As far from God, as heaven is wide. As far from God, as angels can fly. If holy is as holy does. This house will burn straight down to hell. And take its conscience with it as it falls. Nothing said could change the fact. My trust was blind, you broke the pact. If God's my witness, God must be blind. CHORUS. I wish...I wish...I wish...I wish. Take it back, I dare you take it back. No you can't, you should have thought of that. What's inside a man that goes so wrong?. Choke on guilt that's far too good for you. Say one word, I'll laugh and bury you. Leave you in the place where you left me. CHORUS. I wish I could fly. As angels can fly."

Therapy is Speedie's brand new drug. Dancing with the devil's past has never been too fun. It's better off than trying to take a bullet from a gun. And she cries:. Hey baby, can you bleed like me?. C'mon baby, can you bleed like me?. Jt it's gets all fucked up in some karaoke bar. After two drinks he's a loser. After three drinks he's a star. Getting all nostalgic as he sings 'I will survive'. Hey baby, can you bleed like me?. C'mon baby, can you bleed like me?. You should see my scars. You should see my scars. You should see my scars. You should see my scars. And try to comprehend that wich you'll never comprehend"
blood for poppies,"Salute the sun. I've been sitting here all night long. Hauling rock over Buddha with the Longhorn. Got a hole, rip a pocket off my uniform. With the Black Watch Boys. Get your heads down. Duty calls, but it's way too late. I'm too far gone. Waiting for Godot. Hell with my pants down. Cracked the stash. Sent me crying in the midday sun. I miss my dog and I miss my freedom. I don't know why they are calling on the radio. They know I'm here just out of sight. I don't know why they are calling on the radio.

bright tonight,From the beginning we were always going to fail. We were the next thing that the world could not wait to tear down. Off balance in our own minds. Off balance in the ways we looked to everybody else. On and on all summer long we never stood a chance. Sky bright tonight. Live forever always bright tonight. Hey you. You be who you are. You be who you are forever. You be who you are. You my brightest star across the sky. You're bright tonight. It was right now and then suddenly it's gone. We were both wrong but here we are we're right where we belong. Off balance in our own lives. Off balance in the ways we looked to everybody else. On and on all summer long we never stood a chance. Sky bright tonight. Live forever always bright tonight. Hey you. You be who you are. You be who you are forever. You be who you are. You my brightest star across the sky. You're bright tonight

can't cry these tears,I just don't care anymore. I've reached the end of the road. I just don't care anymore. Won't cry these tears anymore. Can't find it in the bible. Can't find it on t.v.. Can't find it in diamonds. There's something inside me that just won't allow me to. Find it in music. Can't find it in my soul. Can't find it in chocolate.

I've reached the end of my rope and it's time that I told you so. I just don't care anymore. Won't cry these tears anymore. It's time to settle the score.

cup of coffee,"You told me you don't love me. Over a cup of coffee. And I just have to look away. A million miles between us. Planets crash into dust. I just let it fade away.

So no, of course, we can't be friends. Not while I'm still this obsessed. I guess I always knew the score. This is how our story ends. I smoke your brand of cigarettes. And pray that you might give me a call. I lie around on bed all day just staring at the walls. Hanging round bars at night. Wishing I had never been born. And give myself to anyone who wants to take me home. So no, of course, we can't be friends. Not while I still feel like this. I guess I always knew the score. This is where our story ends. You left behind some clothes. My belly summersaults. When I pick them off the floor. My friends all say they're worried. I'm looking far too skinny. I've stopped returning all their calls. And no, of course, we can't be friends. Not while I'm still so obsessed. I want to ask where I went wrong. But don't say anything at all. It took a cup of coffee. To prove that you don't love me"

fwy,"You left me black and blue bruises. You cheated on me with lots of girls. Always from behind, in public places. So you didn't have to look into their face. You said there was no one quite like me. Coming inside me felt like coming home. I was so naive, it made me feel like a queen. Such is the ego of the young. [Chorus]. But fucking with you was always fun. Fucking with you was always fun. I want you to know I will always love you. I need you to know I forgive you. I want you to know that I was also to blame. I was never easy to live with back then. [Chorus]. Fucking with you was always fun. Fucking with you was always fun. [Bridge]. And if I could, I wouldn't leave. And I'd do the same again. [Chorus]. Fucking with you was always fun. Fucking with you was always fun. Fucking with you was always fun. Fucking with you was always fun"

We could always get lost in a crowd.. Are you ready to get deep down?. Woo-hoo!. Woo-hoo!. Now there's something you should know about,. I'm chronically depressed..

girls talk (feat. brody dalle),"Stop those voices in your head. They eat away your will. You've everything you need. Hate the way they make you weak. They bring you to your knees. And steal your power away. Girls talk shit when you're backed up against it. Don't believe any word that they hear. And you can do what it is that you want. Without some little bitch in your ear. And girls talk shit, making no bones about it. When you're something that they don't understand. When they see that you got caught with your pants down. When they see you got caught with your pants down. Buy into the things they say. You lose your common sense. You've everything you need. Love to bring you to your knees. And watch you as you bleed. And give your power away. Girls talk shit when you're backed up against it. Don't believe any word that they hear. And you can do what it is that you want. Without some little bitch in your ear. And girls talk shit, making no bones about it. When you're something that they don't understand. And you can do what it is that you want. Without some little bitch in your ear.

Girls talk shit, when your karma is crashing. Girls talk shit, when it falls to the floor. Girls talk shit, when you're biting your nails down. To the quick cause you're feeling secure. Girls talks shit, making no bones about it. Girls talks shit, making no bones about it. You can't do what it is that you want. Without some little bitch in your ear. In your ear. In your ear"
hammering in my head,I'm stressed but you're freestyle. I'm overworked but I'm undersexed. I must be made of concrete. I sign my name across your chest. Give out the same old answers. I trot them out for the relatives. Company tried and tested. I use the ones that I love the best. Like an animal you're moving over me. Like an animal you're moving over me. When did I get perverted. I can't remember your name. I'm growing introverted. You touch my hand and it's not the same. This was so unexpected. I never thought I'd get caught. Play boomerang with your demons. Shoot to kill and you'll pop them off. BANG! BANG!. Like an animal you're moving over me. Like an animal you're moving over me. You should be sleeping my lover. Tell me what you're dreaming of (all 4x). I knew you were mine for the taking. I knew you were mine for the taking. I knew you were mine for the taking. When I walked in the room. I knew you were mine for the taking. I knew you were mine for the taking. Your eyes light up. When I walk in the room. A hammering in my head don't stop. From the bullet train. From Tokyo to Los Angeles. I'm leaving you behind. A flash in the pan. A storm in a teacup. A needle in a haystack. A prize for the winning. A dead for the raising. A catch for the chasing. A jewel for the choosing. A man for the making in this blistering heat. Sweat it all out. Sweat it all out. With your bedroom eyes and your baby pouts. Sweat it all out. In our electric storms and our shifting sands. Our candy jars and our sticky hands. Sweat it all out (6x). Don't forget what I wrote you then. And don't forget what I told you then. And don't forget I that meant to win. And don't forget your ventolin. So a hammering in my head don't stop. In the bullet train from Tokyo to Los Angeles.

happy home,in my happy home I barely breathe. in my lovers arms I find relief. and there´s a sky that´s changing and a bird that sings. I never once in my wayward life was heading to run out. in my lovers arms I wait for morning. I beg my god to speak and tear me apart. I´d lay down my body I´d lay down my arms. I never once in my sweet short life meant anybody harm. in my happy home i read the signs. in my lovers arms I move in time. there´s no more crying and there´s no more lies. I never once in my sweet short life was waiting for desire. and there´s no more crying. and there´s no more pain. I never thought for one second I´d have nothing left but shame. in my happy home I barely breathe. I never once in my wayward life was heading to run out

nobody can win,"Well, I set myself up big time this time. With the notion that you try your best. And everyone wins. But nothing ever goes that smoothly. And it won't end like a movie. Where the good guy always wins. Until you figure out. A way that you can live without. Stories without happy ends. Everyone I know is trying to get by. Fighting all the half-true lies. Nobody can win. The fill you up with expectation,. Innovations and predictions that can't. Possibly fly. Cinderella's waiting tables. And the princess never did wake up. That's how it begins. Until you figure out. A way that you can live without. Stories with happy ends. Everyone I know is trying to get by,. Fighting all the half-true lies. Nobody can win. Nobody can win. Nobody can win"
nobody loves you,"Watching the days slip by so fast. Knowing our fate has long been cast. Working our fingers to the bone. Cause nobody loves you when you're gone, gone, gone, gone. Coughing up feeling just for you. To find something real to hold on to. But there is a hole inside my heart. Where all of my love comes pouring out. You know you'll always be my man. But grab yourself sweetness where you can. Cause sooner or later we're gonna die. Left to the dogs under the sky. I cracked a piece of broken glass. I cracked a piece of broken glass. Coughing up feeling just for you. To find something real to hold on to. But there is a hole inside my heart. Where waves of my love come tumbling out. You say that all the good is gone. That I have forgotten who I am. Free as a bird. Wild as the wind. But somehow I cannot let you in."

This is not my idea of a good time. This is not my idea of a good time. This is not my idea. You thought that I would never see. What was meant for you was meant for me. I was distracted at the time. Forget about yours, now what about mine?. CHORUS. You thought I was a little girl. You thought I was a little mouse. You thought you'd take me by surprise. Now I'm here burnin' down your house.

Tryin' to fit in. And wanting to be loved. It doesn't take much. For someone to shut you down. When you built a shell. Built an army in your mind. You can't sit still. And you don't like anyone round the crowd. They don't understand. You drive by here as I was sleeping. You came to see the whole comotion. And when I woke. I started laughing. But you're so mean for not believing. We are not your kind of people. Speak a different language. We see through your lies. We are not kind of people. Won't be cast as demons. Creatures you despise. We are extraordinary people. We are extraordinary people. We are extraordinary people. We are extraordinary people
