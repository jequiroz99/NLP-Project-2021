feels like home,Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself. Makes me want to lose myself in your arms. There's something in your voice. Makes my heart beat fast. Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life. If you knew how lonely my life has been. And how long I've been so alone. If you knew how I wanted someone to come along. And change my life the way you've done. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong. A window breaks down a long dark street. And a siren wails in the night. But I'm alright cause I have you here with me. And I can almost see through the dark there's light. If you knew how much this moment means to me. And how long I've waited for your touch. If you knew how happy you are making me. I've never thought I'd love anyone so much. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong. Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

feels like home,Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself. Makes me want to lose myself in your arms. There's something in your voice. Makes my heart beat fast. Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life. If you knew how lonely my life has been. And how long I've been so alone. If you knew how I wanted someone to come along. And change my life the way you've done. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong. A window breaks down a long dark street. And a siren wails in the night. But I'm alright cause I have you here with me. And I can almost see through the dark there's light. If you knew how much this moment means to me. And how long I've waited for your touch. If you knew how happy you are making me. I've never thought I'd love anyone so much. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from. Feels like home to me. Feels like home to me. Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong. Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
flying home (brenda's song),It's hard to let you go. You've always let me in. And helped with all the endings. And you know where to begin. I need you here for me. Cuz you always know my heart. I can't believe we'd change. Or have to be apart. But if you've seen the love that's in her eyes. Then everything is good. And if you know the way she felt inside. She's flying where she should. I never believed we'd ever live to see. An angel being born. And flying home. It's good to know your laugh. And you'll always hold my hand. And watch from up in heaven. And always understand. We'll take you down the road. And in everything we do. We'll know how much you love us. A soul that's kind and true. And if you've seen the love that's in her eyes. Then everything is good. And if you know the way she felt inside. She's flying where she should. I never believed we'd ever live to see. An angel being born. And flying home. Ah... Can you see the love in her eyes.

ghosts of you,"We were occupied. And never had to go outside. I was your alibi. We were planning our escape. We stayed up all night. With Lucy in the diamond sky. Drank cheap red wine. And tucked ourselves to sleep. Please don't go. These ghosts of you. The only thing that help get me through the day. Baby please don't go. 'Cause I love you. You're the only one that will stay the same. We could laugh out loud. And sing until the sun came out. We took a secret vow. That we would never change. You always loved to dance. I wish we had another chance. To go back in time. And do it all again. Please don't go. These ghosts of you. The only thing that help get me through the day. Baby please don't go. 'Cause I love you. You're the only one that will stay the same. I don't want to live forever. But if we could be together. Then I wouldn't mind infinity. I don't want to live forever. Oh, but I can still remember.

hands,there's a man outside my door tonight. he cries for help he sings a pleading song. well times are tough for everyone. gotta hold on to what i got. and just kind of cruise along. well i do. want to be helpful. but it's cold and i'm told. you can't be too careful. out of the mouth of a mother. into the hands of a brother. into the heart of a lover. and out of the hands of another.. you can never tell who your neighbour is. or what he's doin' at night or who his friends are. well you don't know where he's from. or where he's been or who he knows. you know you can't be too careful. these days. well i do want to be helpful. whoa but it's cold. and i'm told he might just be the devil. well i don't take chances. and i don't take time to see. and i don't take nothing. from nobody. no way - not me. into the eyes of a child. into the ears of a child. into the heart of a child.

Make the Yule-tide gay. From now on our troubles will be far away. Here we are like the olden days. Happy golden days of yore. Faithful friends who are dear to us. Gather near to us once more. Through the years, we all will be together. If the Fates allow. Hang a shining star up on the highest bough. And have yourself a merry little Christmas now"
i can't make you love me,"Turn down the lights, turn down the bed. Turn down these voices inside my head. Lay down with me, tell me no lies. Just hold me close, don't patronize (don't patronize me). Cause I can't make you love me if you don't. You can't make your heart feel something it won't. Here in the dark, in these lonely hours. I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power. But you won't, no, you won't. Cause I can't make you love me if you don't. I'll close my eyes, then I won't see. The love you don't feel when you're holding me. Morning will come and I'll do what's right. Just give me till then to give up this fight (and I will give up this fight). Cause I can't make you love me if you don't. You can't make your heart feel something it won't. Here in the dark, in these lonely hours. I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power. But you won't, no, you won't.

i'm here (a song for canada),"Thought I was searching for something. But I'm not missing anything. Thought I was needy and wanting. Home sweet home. I thought that I had gotten lost. These prairie fields rolled out and in a moment there I was. Underneath these northern lights. Home sweet home. Home sweet home. I'm here, not going anywhere. I'm here, not going anywhere. The native dances to a drum. The fisherman returns in stormy seas to where he's from. The soldier stretches out his arms. Home sweet home. Home sweet home. I'm here, not going anywhere. I'm here, not going anywhere. I'm here, not going anywhere. I'm here, not going anywhere, going everywhere. Going everywhere. I'm here, not going anywhere. I'm here, not going anywhere. I'm here, not going anywhere. I'm here, going everywhere, going everywhere. Thought I was searching for something. But I'm not missing anything. Thought I was needy and wanting. Home sweet home.

in my life,"""Ba-da-da...."". There are places I remember. All my life. Though some have changed. Some forever. Not for better. Some have gone. And some remain. All these places have their moments. With lovers and friends. I still can recall. Some are dead and some are living. In my life. I've loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers. There is no one. Compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning. When I think of love. As something new. Though I know I'll never ""lose"" affection. For people and things. That went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life. I love you more. Though I know I'll never lose affection. For people and things. That went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them. In my life. I love you more. Oohh..... In my life. I love you more."
in this life,Let me show you what I'm made of. Good intentions are not enough. To get me through today. And this life. You're in the basement. Watching the TV. I'm on the second floor. Watching the ceiling. We sleep underneath the same big sky at night. And dream the same dream we can fly. You can run from me. And you can hide from me. But I am right beside you. In this life. Let me tell you who you really are. You're my comfort. You're not a superstar. Life can reach up and bring you back down. Onto the ground. And give you everything you dream about. You can run from me. And you can hide from me. But I am right beside you. In this life. I'll give you all the things that I'd never get. Give you all I have and have no regrets. Take you to the places that I've never been. Forgive you all the things that you can't forget. Take away the pain with my healing hand. Wash away your sins and set your spirit free. You can run from me. And you can hide from me. But I am right beside you. In this life. You can run from me. And you can hide from me. I am right beside you. In this life. Let me show you what I'm made of.
invincible,"I thought I had the right day, but I was in the wrong place.. I tried to open a door, but got it slammed in my face.. I'm at the back of the line, feels like eternity.. Well, they tell me I'm gettin' close, but I know I'm still far.. You can dress me up, but you can't cover my scars.. I've become a professional at hide and seek.. I'm a danger to myself.. I can take a wrong turn, you're right behind me.. Crash and burn, I know you'll find me.. As long as you're here, I'm invincible.. I can call your name and you'll come running..

Sometimes I think too much, forget my clarity.. I bought every self-help book that I could fit on the shelf.. Too many Downward Dogs, they can be bad for your health.. I don't know who I am, so much for therapy.. I'm a danger to myself.. I can take a wrong turn, you're right behind me.. Crash and burn, I know you'll find me..

julia,"Well you looked so at peace. Tryin to find real love. Your hair was like a fire. Such a pretty woman. You were hiding out in the open. Searching so hard. For a kiss that lasts forever.

ken's song,Words & Music: Chantal Kreviazuk. I hadn?t seen the boy in fifteen years. He had lines that said he cried a rainbow of tears. He left one day before his late night drives. He said everybody?s gotta make a sacrifice. So he replaced the old girl for a boat named Jen. He thought if anyone could love her. Well he was the man. He said my only fear is growing old alone. I?ve gotta get a lover for this telephone. It doesn?t matter if my number?s gone when I?m young. But I don?t want to grow old alone. Till the day Jen sunk she gave him love so true. She was appraised at fifty-one grand or two. It didn?t matter that she took every dime that he had. He had to get off the water and live by the land. He said my only fear is growing old alone. I've gotta get a lover for this telephone. It doesn't matter if my number's gone when I'm young. But I don't want to grow old alone. When I spoke about Jen a tear flowed from his eye. It was the first and last time I saw a grown man cry. He said believe it or not I?m not scared to die. But I don?t want to grow old alone. He said my only fear is growing old alone. I've gotta get a lover for this telephone. It doesn't matter if my number's gone when I'm young. But I don't want to grow old alone.

love's recovery,"Words & Music: Emily Saliers. During the time of which I speak. It was hard to turn the other cheek. To the blows of insecurity. Feeding the cancer of my intellect. The blood of love soon neglected. Lay dying in the strength of its impurity. Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together. They've all gone and left each other. In search of fairer weather. And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast. To the slim chance of love's recovery. There I am in younger days, star gazing. Painting picture perfect maps. Of how my life and love would be. Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection. My compass, faith in love's perfection. I missed ten million miles of road i should have seen. Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together. Left each other one by one on the road to fairer weather. And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast. To the slim chance of love's recovery. Rain soaked and voice choked. Like silent screaming in a dream. I search for our absolute distinction. Not content to bow and bend. To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures. Eating us away, eating us away. Eating us away to our extinction. Oh how i wish i were a trinity. So if i lost a part of me. I'd still have two of the same to live. But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal. As specks of dust we're universal. To let this love survive. Would be the greatest gift that we could give. Tell all the friends who think they're so together. That these are ghosts and mirages. All these thoughts of fairer weather. Though it's storming out I feel safe within the arms. Of love's discovery."
m,"Words & Music: Chantal Kreviazuk. They must mean business. To say there's nothing worse. Then to let your precious love child. Leave the planet first. 'Cause, oh whoa whoa.

And all the things you never .... So I think we're gonna have to record her. Sometimes against her will. We're gonna keep her alive with black and whites. Colour moving and still. And then, oh whoa whoa. We've gotta just let her go. All the things that you swear you're gonna do. Reservations on the next train to the moon. Pack your things cause there ain't no time to lose.

mad about you,"Don't you want to get to know me well. Don't lie to me cause I can always tell. When you're feeling strange. I know you. There's no point in banging any blame.

Every line does me good. I know it's not the way we planned. I love it when yo take my hand. And kiss me and then just hold still. You fill me with all your energy. Your poisons, antidotes and sympathies. In a place that no one could ever fill. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. I'm feeling like I never thought I could. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. Every line does me good. An you won't be alone when you sleep tonight. Cause I worry, oh I'm worrying too. But the ocean sends waves to the beach so we'll play. And to clean all the water up too. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. I'm feeling like I never thought I would. I'm mad about you. Overwhelmed. Every line does me good. Every line on you face does me good"

o holy night,"Words & Music: Unknown. O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining. It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth. Long lay the world in sin and error pining. Till He appeared and the soul felt His worth. A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices. For yonder beams a new and glorious morn. Fall on your knees. Oh, hear the angel voices. O night divine. O night when Christ was born. O night divine. O night, O night divine. Truly he taught us to love one another. His law is love and His gospel is peace. Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother. And in His name all oppression shall cease. Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus rise we. Let all within us praise His holy name. Christ is the Lord then ever, ever praise we. His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim. His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim"

san diego serenade,Words & Music: Tom Waits. Never saw the morning till I stayed up all night. Never saw the sunshine till I turned out the light. Never saw my home town till I stayed away too long. I never heard the melody till I needed the song. Never saw the white line till I was leavin' you behind. Never knew I needed you till I was caught up in a bind. And I never spoke I love you till I cursed you in vain. Never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane. Never saw the East coast until I moved to the West. I never saw the moonlight till it shone off your breast. And I never saw your heart till someone tried to steal it away. Never saw your tears till they rolled down your face. I never saw the morning till I stayed up all night. Never saw the sunshine till you turned out the light. Never saw my home town till I stayed away too long. I never heard the melody till I needed the song.

And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free. She steals like a thief. But she's always a woman to me. Oh, she takes care of herself. She can wait if she wants. She's ahead of her time. Oh, and she never gives out. And she never gives in. She just changes her mind. She will promise you more. Than the Garden of Eden. Then she'll carelessly cut you. And laugh while you're bleeding. But she'll bring out the best. And the worst you can be. Blame it all on yourself. 'Cause she's always a woman to me. Oh, she takes care of herself. She can wait if she wants. She's ahead of her time. Oh, and she never gives out. And she never gives in. She just changes her mind. She is frequently kind. And she's suddenly cruel. She can do as she pleases.

What are we doing here. Who are we supposed to be. I'll take a better world. I'll take anything. I'll take our little world now. Where we can wear each other for awhile. I'll lend you my tears if I could borrow. your smile. We'll get through tomorrow somehow today. Happy After.... Once upon these days. [Thanks to Christina for lyrics]

And now you've decided to show me the same. No sweeping exits or off stage lines. Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. I know I've dreamed you, it's a sin, it's a lie. And I have my freedom but I don't have much time. Faith has been broken tears must be cried. So let's do some living after we die. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away. Wild, wild horses we'll ride them someday."

Too late to tell you I'm alone. I wanna wake you from another lonely night. Too late to wonder where you are. Too late to hold you in my arms. Cause if you're looking for wonderful. I'm wonderful. I'm a very simple girl. And I don't fit into this world. The city lights leave me in a daze. And even though we've never met. You know what I'm trying to forget. Some things you can't change. Is it too late to call you on the phone. Too late to tell you I'm alone. I wanna wake you from another lonely night. Too late to wonder where you are. Too late to hold you in my arms. Cause if you're looking for wonderful. I'm wonderful. I'm underneath. I'm underneath. I'm underneath. Is it too late to call you on the phone. Too late to tell you I'm alone. I wanna wake you from another lonely night. Too late to wonder where you are. Too late to hold you in my arms. Cause if you're looking for wonderful. I'm wonderful
