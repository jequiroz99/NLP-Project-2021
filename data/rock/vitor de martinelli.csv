a dreamer dreams,"On a cold afternoon returning from the work. I dreamed that nothing was so far. She could even control my mind. But who heard she crying was me. When a dreamer dreams. She never dies and is it so for me. We always feel what the other feels. In the rain we are all equal. But she no. But she no. But she no. As the year, she has stations. We are like the earth and the moon. We thought the same things before bed. The problem is that she only exists so. When a dreamer dreams. She never dies and is it so for me. At some point always we felt our pain. But in the rain we are all equal. We're only one. We're only one. We're only one"
