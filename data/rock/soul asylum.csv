runaway train,"Call you up in the middle of the night. Like a firefly without a light. You were there like a blow torch burning. I was a key that could use a little turning. So tired that I couldn't even sleep. So many secrets I couldn't keep. Promised myself I wouldn't weep. One more promise I couldn't keep. It seems no one can help me now. I'm in too deep. There's no way out. This time I have really led myself astray. Chorus. Runaway train never going back. Wrong way on a one way track. Seems like I should be getting somewhere. Somehow I'm neither here nor there. Can you help me remember how to smile. Make it somehow all seem worthwhile. How on earth did I get so jaded. Life's mystery seems so faded. I can go where no one else can go. I know what no one else knows. Here I am just drownin' in the rain. With a ticket for a runaway train. And Everything seems cut and dry. Day and night, earth and sky. Somehow I just don't believe it. Chorus. Bought a ticket for a runaway train. Like a madman laughin' at the rain. Little out of touch, little insane. Just easier than dealing with the pain. Chorus. Runaway train never comin' back. Runaway train tearin' up the track. Runaway train burnin' in my veins. Runaway but it always seems the same"

And old things seemed new. Well, She was just six when she turned her first trick. But,now she's 13 and it don't make her sick. And she does lots of chrystal. and she owns her own pistol. Got a goldfish named Silver. And a pimp who's named Rick. And some are like customers,and some are like patience. She'd have gone back to school, if she just had the patience. She saw the world through the eyes of a child. None of the nightmares and nothing to deny. Yes she saw the world. And she's seen it all and she knows. They're all lies."
fearless,Jesus was a hippy. Peace and Love was all he was about. That's why they killed him. Sad shit something people can't figure out. Now the same folks who worship him are the ones who would have cheered at the. Crucifixion. They got no conviction. It doesn't matter if the man was fact or fiction.. Nixon was a liar. It's the one thing believed to be true. But Tricky Dick was not a crook. Whatever that means. Whatever presidents do.
fearless leader,"Jesus was a hippie, peace and love was all he was about. That's why they killed him, cause that sh*t's something people can't figure out.

Nixon was a liar it's the one thing believed to be true. But tricky dick was not a crook whatever that means, whatever presidents do. Money can't buy you children and nothing can bring them back to you. We all make mistakes we all need someone to look up to. But who're you gonna call your fearless leader. Who's gonna put your fears to bed. But heroes will never let you down just as long as they're dead. Satan is a feeling, deviance it lurks in everyone. Guilty pleasures, mischievous behavior can be fun. No one made you do it, nobody but yourself to blame. It's always at your door and trouble is it's name. But who're you gonna call your fearless leader. Who's gonna put your fears to bed. Sometimes you gotta pick and choose. Sometimes no matter what you lose. Divine was a woman whos' private parts said she was a man. Those were his private parts the parts that he could never understand. But she was an actress she could be anything that she wanted. Her reality was the very thing that she flaunted. But who're you gonna call your fearless leader. Who's gonna put your fears to bed. But heroes will never let you down just as long as they're dead. But who're you gonna call your fearless leader. When you run from fear you leave yourself behind. You can't dump your fears on someone else. Cause it's all in your mind."

goin' down,"Floatin' down the river. With a saturated liver. And I thought I would forgive her. But I do believe she meant it. When she told me to forget it. And I bet she will regret it. When they find me in the morning wet and drowned. And the word gets 'round. Goin' down. I'm Goin' down. Coming' up for air. It's pretty stuffy under there. I'd like to say I didn't care. But I forgot to leave a note. And it's so hard to stay afloat. I'm soakin' wet without a boat. And I knew I should have taken off my shoes. It's front page news. Goin' down. I'm goin' down. I wish I had another drink. It wouldn't be so hard to sink. I should have taken time to think. Besides I got the picture straight. She must have had another date. I didn't need this extra weight. I wish that I could see the way to shore. Don't want no more. Goin' down. I'm goin' down. And now I see the life I led. I slept it all away in bed. I should have learned to swim instead. And now it's really got me stumped. I can't believe why I jumped. I'd like to get my tummy pumped. I can't believe they drink this stuff in town. This dirty brown. Goin' down. I'm goin' down. I wish I looked before I leaped. I didn't know it was so deep. Been down so far I don't get wet. Haven't touched the bottom yet. This river scene is gettin' old. I'm hungry, sleepy, wet and cold. She told me to forget it nice. I should have taken her advice. I only want to go back home. I'd gladly leave that girl alone. What a way to spend the night. If I don't drown, I'll die of fright. My pappy taught me how to float. But I can't swim a single note. He threw me in to teach me how. I stayed there floatin' like a mama cow. And now I've floated way down stream. I know this has to be a dream. If I could find my way to shore. I'd never, never do this anymore. I'll give you three, I've been down nine. I'm goin' down just one more time.. Goin' down.. I'm goin' down.. Now the sky is gettin' light. And everything will be alright. Think I finally got the knack. Just floatin' here lazy on my back. I never really liked that town. I think I'll ride the river down. Just movin' slow and floatin' free. There's a river swingin' under me.. Waving back to the folks on shore. I should have thought of this before. I'm floatin' on down to New Orleans. Goin' to pick up on some swingin' scenes. I know I'll know a better day. I'll go down groovin' all the way. Goin' down. Goin' down."
gravity,"There's a little man, who can get his hands. On a plan to sell the planet. Walks the walk, and he talks the talk. And for half up front you could have it. For every answer there are ways to shoot it down. We'll need some greenbacks, and a green light. Some jets with wings to get this new thing off the ground. But I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it. The way you handle it, I got to hand it to you. No I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it. Just like you planned it, I'm coming out of my shoes. All shined up. They wind me up. Like a toy on the first day of school. Stranded, abandoned. Still waiting in a line of fools. For every question there are answers to spare. Stop at the convenient store without convenience we ain't going anywhere. No I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it. The way you handle it, I got to hand it to you. No I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it, just like you planned it. I'm coming out of my shoes. So far from home. Just drifting off alone. Just floating away. Off into space. Shine down a dead end street. Go get what you need. Just a trick or treat. It's all the same to me. Live how you wanna live. Just like a candlelight. Like a shooting star, still flickering, still glowing. The room is still on fire. For every question there are ways to shoot it down. Put your feet down on the cold ground. I do believe that this time you are coming around. I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it. The way you handle it, I got to hand it to you. No I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it. Just like you planned it, I'm coming out of my shoes. No I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it. The way you handle it, I got to hand it to you. No I can't stand the gravity, can't stand it, don't understand it. I'm coming out of my shoes. Shine down a dead end street. Go get what you need. Just a trick or treat. It's all the same to me. Live how you wanna live. Like a candle light, shooting star, still flickering. You can always take your time, unless the room's on fire. Make it last a while, still glowing. Floating on a summer breeze, a warm wind, roaring. Like a dandelion starting to disintegrate"
grounded,When (aid?) turned sideways. (And? It'd?) head on down the highway. Say this is my way. Disappearing forever. But there ain't just one way. So you choose the fun way. Slide down the (runway?). On a ticket that goes two ways. And by the way that it sounded. You thought that you'd be astounded. But you left it like you found it. Cause it wasn't yours to take. What once seemed like dying. Soon turned into flying. So you settle for trying. And you wish you were grounded. No you cannot get much higher. Than your utmost desire. So you bring it down to size and. Now it seems that you are grounded. By the way that it sounded. You thought that you'd be astounded. But you left it like you found it. Now you find that you are grounded.
growing into you,"You never grow out of mischief making. You never grow out of taking. You never grow out of complicating. When simple things are waiting. But I'm growing into you. I'm growing into you. There's one thing that I know that's perfectly clear. You never grow out of fear. You never grow out of fear. You never grow out of contemplating. When it ain't worth debating. You never grow out of mistake making. You never grow out of faking. But I'm growing into you. I'm growing into you. There's one thing that I know that's perfectly clear. You never grow out of fear. You never grow out of fear. I'm growing into you. I'm growing into you. There's one thing that I know that's perfectly clear. You never grow out of fear (x6). And will I ever, ever, ever get over it."
growing pain,"Riding into town when the sun goes down. And the natives get restless and the crowd comes round. Pacing in place in a backward race. While starting my case to another blank face. I'm just sitting on the roadside. Watching all the cards and the clouds roll by. They may pass me by. But i need a better reason to cry. Growing pain it leaves a stain. That's similar but not the same. It's down the drain and what remains. Maybe you're the one who's a little insane. Now everything's lovely if you're ugly. What you would, what you should, and what you could be. Mr right, spending his life,. Stabbing himself with a butter knife. I'm just sitting on the roadside. Watching all the cards and the clouds roll by. They may pass me by. But I need a better reason to cry. Growing pain's a spinning blade. Whirling round you like a razor edged chain. It's down the drain and what remains. Maybe you're the one who's a little insane. Growing pain it leaves a stain. That's similar but not the same. Its down the drain and what remains. Maybe you're the one who can make that change. Can't shake hands with boxing gloves. With whips and chains you'll never make love. ."
gullible's travels,"Keep a watch out behind you from that which can blind you. And die like a dream in a jar. Forewarned if hindsight is all that makes you right. You're running away but you won't get very far. No it's not my intention to harbor pretensions. Or told you I hadn't a clue. Took fate by the neck and you'll never look back. You've forgotten more than I ever knew. Everything's turning but mostly just turning out wrong. What's lost was once burning and (finally?) the day seems so long. And it's Gullible's Travels and nothing unravels this way. Just another lost journey where everything's turning away. Saving crowds from the roar from the cutting room floor. Played it at night in his dreams. Woke up was cold and his manager had sold him. It's louder than love but don't think I know what it means. Nobody's talking and who tells you when to go home. Guess I wore out my welcome, it's better than being alone. And it's Gullible's Travels and nothing unravels this way. Just another lost journey where everything's turning away. Shot in the dark landed short of the mark. Can't hold a candle to you. Flame's burning brightly and shines in so lightly. But lighting the day alone seems so untrue. Everything's turning but mostly just turning out wrong. What's lost was once burning but (finally?) the day seems so long. And it's Gullible's Travels and nothing unravels this way. Just another lost journey where everything's turning away. ?? today."
happy,"When I'm with my friends my troubles end. I'm one of the boys, so self employed. When we're together, could last forever. And I'm almost there. I'm away from the boss, at least for awhile. I'm away from the girls that cramp my style. I'm away from the jerks, I'm away from the works. And I'm almost there, I'm almost there. And it's happy time, happy, happy time. It's happy time, happy time, happy time. Got a happy head, so happy, happy time. I wish I could be this happy all the time. I'll take one of those, and four of those. And more of those, and more of those. I'm away from the jerks, I'm away from the works. And I'm almost there, I'm almost there."
homesick,"I want to live with you. In the fifth demension. In a dream I've never had. Cause I just can't live like this. In a world like this. I just want a kiss goodbye. We are not of this world. And there's a place for us. Stuck inside this fleeting moment. Tucked away where no one owns it. Wrapped up in a haste,. And by mistake got thown away. And oh, I am so homesick. But it ain't that bad. Cause I'm homesick for the home I've never had. I know I sometimes get annoyed. I know just where I'm at. This is my song of joy. And now I know there are no secret tricks. No correct politics. Just liars and lunatics. And we are not of this world. And there's a place for us. Stuck inside this fleeting moment. Tucked away where no one owns it. Wrapped up in a haste,. And by mistake got thown away. And oh, I am so homesick. But it ain't that bad. Cause I'm homesick for the home I've never had. And though I would not take it personally. It's just the child in me. I never really knew how much I had. And woe is me, I am so homesick. But it ain't that bad. Cause I'm homesick for the home I never had."

hopes up,There's just no substitute for fun. I've tried every single one. And no one can take your place. Everybody gets replaced. My time has neither come nor gone. It just slips out when I yawn. Without hope I can't go wrong. Don't get my hopes up now. Don't get my hopes up now. It's so hard to settle down. Don't recognize my home town. Home is where I hang my head. Lost in all these things I said. Been holding my breath for so long. I don't need air anymore. If you never let me breathe. I'll never breathe. Don't get my hopes up now. Don't get my hopes up now. Don't know what I was hoping for. I feel like feeling better than I ever felt before. My time has neither come nor gone. It just slips out when I yawn. Holding my breath for so long.

Don't get my hopes up now.
i did my best,"Holed up in the dressing room without a dress. Kneeling at the confessional with nothing to confess. And I knew all about my surprise party. I was spoiled and depressed. Hey I acted surprised and I told lots of lies. Yes I did my best. Stop the truck at the truck stop, I need something to help me crash. Food stamps, checks and credits cards, but they only accepted cash. There was sweat beating on my brow. My heart was beating out of my chest. So I stole everything they couldn't give away. Yes I did my best. And I did the best that I could do. With all the mess that I've been through. What did you expect me to do. I did my best for you. I was waiting for a chain reaction with the missing link. Waiting for that trickle-down forever circling the sink. I was tired of being tired. I could not get no rest. So I kept sleep-walking and talking in my sleep. Yes I did my best. And I did the best that I could do. With all the mess that I've been through. What did you expect me to do. I did my best for you."

i will still be laughing,"Doorways open up and close more ways to a punchline. They're all laughing at your clothes, standing in the lunch line. You're the talk of the town cause you're up and you're down. It's a cycle, I've found, it always comes around. But I will still be laughing. Yes I will still be laughing. Air raids in the afternoon, the children are playing. Switchblades, colored red balloons, no one hears your praying. And it comes back to you, all the things that you do. Will come looking for you, will come looking for you. But I will still be laughing. Yes I will still be laughing. Doorways lead to other rooms, always leave you lying. Face down in a stranger's tomb, didn't know you were dying. And you rise and you fall, and you wait for the call. You're watching the walls, you're watching the walls. But I will still be laughing. I will still be laughing. Yes I will still be laughing. I will still be laughing."

nice guys (don't get paid),"Well they packed up their violin cases ??. Hopped in a big black Studebaker, they were acting pretty scary. No one talked as they synchronized their watches.

And the gangsters, cowboys, gypsies, and freewheelers. Sold out their trades to become drug dealers. There ain't no money in doing things straight. Your community thanks you, business is good, and nice guys don't get paid. Outside the train window fast as he could ride. Was a kid on a horse with a head full of lies.

An extended family with fiddlers and magicians. A juggler and a chemist who'd invent potion. to pacify all the killers and rapist. The chemist died in the burglary and they sold the prescription. For a case of cheap red wine to a traveling salesman. In a three-wheeled jalopy; he bought and sold potions. To the city that looked over the ocean. And he sold the last drop, it was big with the rich kids. And soon the city would be crawling with addicts. And back rooms, dark allies, basements and attics. (When?) a fly is trapped in a spider's web (but a bat's got the spider?). And no one knows what's going on. But you've gotta show up for yourself at the end of the day. And nice guys don't get paid.

In a city full of addicts and color television."

Every one just looks away, just like any other day. I've nothing to write home about. Nothing I have figured out. Still I have the same old doubts. Nothing to write home about. Who can teach me how to change my ways. Who will come and save the day. Who will tell me what to say. When there's nothing left to say. Nobody told me about any of this in school.

ode,"Well my friend Jud he was a fuddy-dud. Chewed his cud, was a stick in the mud. I swear he hated everyone. And he's bumming nickels and bumming dimes. But most of all you know he's just bumming time. And every day was a bad day. They walked out and on and over him. He was turning gray. Never knew love he gave up on hope. Stayed in bed and he stopped using soap was a dirty old man. But he never said poor little old me. Poor poor. Now one fine day he won the lottery. Instant millionaire without a care it didn't change a thing. Drove up to Reno he lost everything at a roadside casino. You know he never made it into town. Where the bright lights trickle down. He was a casualty. Well he _____________________ and he ran out of food. And all he got was more lewd and crude. He was very rude. The only thing he hated worse than the city. Was charity and self pity he'd been around. I talked to him that's what I found. He was a casualty. Poor little old me. Poor poor casualty."

promises broken,Streets are filled with broken glass. You get buried by the past. Give me just a little taste. Lay this mess to waste. Take me home. My mind is racing take me home. My body's achin'so alone. I'll make you want to stay with me. Befriended by the enemy. One more time. And every little thing about this tells me. Nothing out there is ever gonna help me. All these words that I hear spoken just promises broken now. Looking outside from my window sill. Throw another coin in the wishing well. You'll never find what you're looking for. Fifteen miles. Your dim light shines from so far away. Your sad smile. Is all I see when I say. That every little thing about this tells me. Nothing out there is ever gonna help me. All these words that I hear spoken just promises broken now. From the Hotel Satellite. Don't look like you're living right. Here's a deal you can't refuse. You ain't got as much to lose. Can you tell your troubles to. Someone who won't laugh at you. It's all right. And as I watch you walk away. Hope a part of you would stay. It's all right. And every little thing about this tells me. Nothing out there is ever gonna help me. All these words that I hear spoken just promises broken now.

Because the meat from the pork is so sweet. And the bone from the pork give to me. Put the bone in she begged him. As she paced across the floor. Put the bone in she yelled out once more. Put the bone in. She yelled at the store. Cause my doggie's been hit by a car. And I do want to bring him home something. Put the bone in. She yelled out once more ....
religiavision,"Nail myself way up high and I'm gonna die for you. The mother offers up the child to the preaching of channel two. The empires rise and the babies cry, when is the lesson to be learned. And all I hear is the commercials and now the crosses are gonna burn. Now I ain't gonna be the cure to wash away your sins. Why so the children have to pay for the poor planning that you did. No matter how loud you scream and cry you're gonna be sentenced to suffer. You married your life and you married you wife and now you're gonna have to. learn to love her. But can you love her?. I like to watch religious TV, what you get is not what you see. Religiovision.

runaway train,"Call you up in the middle of the night. Like a firefly without a light. You were there like a blow torch burning. I was a key that could use a little turning. So tired that I couldn't even sleep. So many secrets I couldn't keep. Promised myself I wouldn't weep. One more promise I couldn't keep. It seems no one can help me now. I'm in too deep. There's no way out. This time I have really led myself astray. Chorus. Runaway train never going back. Wrong way on a one way track. Seems like I should be getting somewhere. Somehow I'm neither here nor there. Can you help me remember how to smile. Make it somehow all seem worthwhile. How on earth did I get so jaded. Life's mystery seems so faded. I can go where no one else can go. I know what no one else knows. Here I am just drownin' in the rain. With a ticket for a runaway train. And Everything seems cut and dry. Day and night, earth and sky. Somehow I just don't believe it. Chorus. Bought a ticket for a runaway train. Like a madman laughin' at the rain. Little out of touch, little insane. Just easier than dealing with the pain. Chorus. Runaway train never comin' back. Runaway train tearin' up the track. Runaway train burnin' in my veins. Runaway but it always seems the same"

standing in the doorway,Standing in the doorway. Wondering if it's safe to go outside. Wondering if I'll come back. Wondering if I might just drift out with the rising tide. Sitting and waiting and hoping to find. Something you're good at to use up your time. To crawl from the ocean and lie on the shore. A moonbeam the rests on the dust on your floor. I'm not going out there. Don't try to tell me I'm paranoid. Wouldn't say I'm not scared. Though it may be safe to say that I am annoyed. In the intersection traffic lights are red in all directions. Everyone breaks the law sometimes. We all break down have foolish pride and. Beg for some affection. I can't say I know how you feel everyone seems to know. Are you sure I would if I could help you remember. What it's like to feel good. Chitter and chatter and everything matters. I ask how you're feeling. And you just act shattered. Asleep on the couch with your eyes open wide. Standing in the doorway. Waiting as you come and as you leave. You say get out of my way. Won't you stop and talk about the hectic life you lead. They're all going somewhere. They all have some place they have to be. Maybe I should join them. I wish I could I think I have to stay here with me. It brings a tear to your eye to get out into the open. I can't believe I see myself. Coming into focus.
straight up,You know the galaxy's full of black holes. We don't know which one have the fatals. Oh take a look I take a look inside. This is a whle new kind of illusion. Based on a brand new kind of confusion. Built on wise decisions based on foolish pride. And you wonder why you wasted all this time. Oh Trying to find gold in a salt mine. And now you've reached the limit. But the limit is the sky. Oh straight up one more straight up one more time. This is a character assasination. This is a character that needs a vacation. All too soon too long too much for one mind. You gotta step back and take inventory. You're only seeing one side of the story. And a good story is changing all the time. There is always one more sucker doing fine. One more trucker driving that white line. Delivering nothing to no one everywhere. Oh straight up one more straight up one more time. It's much too easy to give up. Much too hard to get up. To another day just like yesterday. And this time there is no escape this time. And any explanation would be fine. And now you've reached the limit. But the limit is the sky. Oh straight up one more straight up one more time.
stranger,"Stranger. . I said ""Hey brown girl I seen tears through the window of the junk shop. downtown"". Selling trinkets from your far off homeland, did the Promise land let you down?. I said ""hey young boy I notice that you ain't afraid to walk next to me"". ""Old man, you look like you're dying, is that all you want is a quarter from. me?"". Sometimes I feel like a stranger, I feel like a stranger. I'm just another face in a faceless crowd, I'm just another king in a headless. crown. I'm so alone. Y'know I live here in this city, but this place it just ain't. nobody's home. Now how many times do I got to tell you?. There's no such thing as a man made world. Now how many times do I got to tell you?. There's no such thing as a man-tamed girl. Sometimes I feel like stranger, and I feel even stranger. I want to buy some flowers for my mother, if I only had another chance. You see, I got a happy family, but that's oh so far away. You see, I've got it all here inside me, but I just can't seem to get it out. But I know with a little imagination we can work this whole goddamn thing out. Oh don't make me feel so strange, and I feel even stranger."
string of pearls,"She swings. The string. Of pearls on the corner. The streelight reflects. The light on the water. The string, it snaps. And the pearls go sailing. And they splash. And bounce. And roll cross the wet street. As she bends to chase the pearls. A car swings round the corner. She darts from the eyes. Of the panic struck driver. Whos racing to. The delivery room. 'Cause in the backseet his wife. Is busting out of her womb. The sack breaks and out come the siamese twins. Who grow up to become. The first president with two heads. Are better than one. He puts his heads in his hands,. Says I gotta put my heads together. I can become the Best President Ever. And not just president. Fend for yourself. Signs his name takes the blame. For all of the names with no shame. In their beliefe they adjourn. And the leave. And in walks a man. With a broom, and a knife. And blood on his hands. And he sweeps everything. Under the rug. And goes home. To his kids, and he gives them a hug. But his wife was not there, she had just left a letter. That said you'll be much. Better off without me. Now his wife took the train. To her ex-lovers funeral. Who died in the bathroom,. Hit his head on a urinal. When they got together, the knowledge was carnal. And the widow was at the funeral, and they had quite a catfight. And they fell into the grave where the casket was resting. And the preacher just left in the middle of the service. 'Cause death was one thing,. But women made him nervous. And he got into his car,. And he drove round the corner. Then something in the street. Caught the light in his eye. He bent over, reached down. And picks up the pearl from the gutter. He didnt know what to think. He took it home and washed it in the sink. And he gave the pearl. To Sister Mary Theresa. Who could not accept it,. So she gave it to Lisa. A young prostitute who was missing a pearl. Off the necklace that broke. Late last night."
summer of drugs,"My sister got bit by a copperhead snake. In the woods behind the house. Nobody was home so I grabbed her foot. And I sucked that poison out. My sister got better in a month or two. When the swelling it went down. But I'd started off my teenage years with a poison in my mouth. And we were too young to be hippies. Missed out on the love. Turned to a teen in the late 70's. In the summer of the drugs. Mama and daddy could never understand, their life was never dull. Their idea of a rollicking time was a kitchen tap appall. Acid grass downs and speed, junk those days were made of. How could they suspect those kids where the monsters meet their makers. Mommies and daddies were too shy to talk about those birds and bees. Integrated schools had stopped the facts of life were these. Girls and boys went away and came back, empty after the weekend. The talk on the phone consisted of hushed voices speaking. Boys and girls in every town. Sand man spread his sand around. Now we are just waking up. From a summer of drugs."

tell me when,She's all by herself at the end of the day. She'd talk to herself but wouldn't know what to say. Wrings her hands and steps out of the bath. The mirror laughs and splits her in half. She looks around the room. At her carpeted tomb. Threw the phone on the floor. Left the keys in the door. Tell me when does life begin. She got in the car and looked up at the stars. And made a wish. She held her breath and considered death. And in the rearview mirror. She looked back on her reflection. She was a long way from she wanted to be. And a long way from perfection. Tell me when does life begin. She chickened out and she called triple-A. And told them the way. After she paid they fixed the car. She got on her way and she drove past the bar. Where no one bought her a drink at. She always though it was 'cause she was too fat. And now she knows those places blow. Or maybe it was her nose. Tell me when does life begin.
the break,Candy coated cannibalistic newsflashed across the screen. Stay tuned we'll define what's wrong and what's right. What's obscure and what's obscene. And the fat cat laughs as you lose your last chance as his pants split right down the seams. But if I ever get my break for God's sake. I'm gonna make my break clean. Yes I may be a dirty old man by the time I can beat down this dirty old scene. But if I ever get my break. I'm gonna make my break clean. I've got bars on my windows and lines on my face. I can't compete in this race. I don't like it when she's on the street at night. She can barely go anyplace. And everybody wants control of her body and I'm hoping the choice might be me. If I ever get my break for God's sake. I'm gonna make my break clean. If you ever give me a break. I'm gonna make my break clean. Shake me I've painted myself in the corner of an escape artist's dream. And you know I believe it cause I just can't leave it. I don't really know what it means. I may be buried alive or just left in the dirt. I'm fading as fast as my jeans. If I ever get my break for God's sake. I'm gonna make my break clean.

And then she bails you out. And then you feel like an ass. Where have you gone,. Got the selfyou got nothing to eat. I'll see you on the streets. But she keeps me off the streets,. She keeps me off the streets,. She keeps me off the streets,. But she keeps me off the streets."
the sun maid,"Tell me how you get that shine. You must polish all the time. Though I know your job is thankless. They will thank you up in heaven. Oh the Sun Maid. Looking for the shade. Though they say she's not too bright. She takes care of all the light. Without you it's cold and stark. We would all be in the dark. Without the Sun Maid. She never gets paid. Searching for the shade. Oh the Sun Maid. You are so taken for granted. With each and every seed that's planted. And the earth is so demanding. All the young girls are out tanning. The Sun Maid. She's such an old maid. She never gets laid. Oh the Sun Maid. Now you're tired, your day is over. Now the moon is one day older."
tied to the tracks,"What are you doing here in my nightmare? (In my nightmare). Stepping back into the stupidness gets me nowhere (Gets me nowhere). Look at you now - You look like an angel in hell. Look at you now - Drown in your wishing well. Look at you now - All those strories and there's no one to tell. Look at you now. Do you think you can find a place for your dreams in my nightmares?. And you're tied to the tracks but the train broke down. Wake me up and let me go (from) somebody I used to know. From somewhere in my nightmare.. Don't you remember the years we got nowhere? (We got nowhere). Look at you now - You look like an angel in hell. Look at you now - Drown in your wishing well. Look at you now - All those strories and there's no one to tell. Look at you now. Do you think you can find a place for your dreams in my nightmares?. And you're playing with a different joker, but there's always one more sucker. And you're tied to the tracks but the train broke down. Trapped at the top of the merry-go-round. But it won't let you down.. Look at you now - You look like an angel in hell. Look at you now - Drown in your wishing well. Look at you now - All those strories and there's no one to tell. Look at you now. Do you think you can find a place for my dreams?."

twiddly dee,Twiddly Dee fe fi fo fum. There's a giant sleeping and his pants are undone. He shows no pity for anyone. He's sure to be killed before the morning comes. Twiddle my fingers and I twiddle my thumb. 'Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til my work is all done. I'm a high society skid row bum. Well on my way to Kingdom Come. I twiddle in the middle of the moon and sun. I'm wishing and dreaming I'm a special someone. Don't leave my load on anyone. It's way too high and it weighs a ton. Do re mi fe fi fo fum. I'm a slave to the music of a father and son. I never force it on anyone. Can't keep it a secret so I keep it on the run. They may say what they say about the way that we stay. They may do what they do about the things that we do. Hey ________________ spill your rum. Ain't worried about the dumb things I done. Ain't worried about the dumb things to come. ______________________ little bit of fun. Hey _______________________________________. Sometimes I wanna be friends with everyone. My friends tell me it can't be done. And some days I feel I don't know anyone. Now what goes up doesn't always come down. You'll never believe the things I've found. Amazing what you learn just hanging around. Can't put a square peg in a hole that's round. They may say what they say about the way that we stay. They may do what they do about the things that we do. Hey _______________________________. If we win or if we lose it's a pleasure to play. Work all night and I sleep all day. Just because I'm lucky I can live my own way.
veil of tears,"Well, a fascinating sensation, no I can't even feel it. I just had to let you know I can't conceal it. I was recently considering taking the pain with the pleasure. Just to find my way to the bottom of this, I'll have to dig forever. And it's no small measure. Lift up your veil of tears. Don't be disappointed child, if your prayers go unanswered. We are not responsible for these sad circumstances. Secret agents and freedom fighters on those impossible missions. Better put your toys and games away, maybe take the kids out fishing. For a family treasure. In your early years. Behind your veil of tears. So frustrated. Get up anyway. So complicated. Changes every day. So the darkness fades. And the light will come shining through. I heard the eyes that look to a better world. always hide beneath the veil of tears. And you hide no more. Lift up your veil of tears. Hide no more. Behind your veil of tears. Now the executioner must be executed. No I think we'll set him free instead, watch him run. And you hide no more. Lift up your veil of tears. You hide no more."
voodoo doll,"I'm hung up on a wire so thin,. tearing out what's been trapped in. My puppet strings, been pulled too tight. I can see the real me's going to be a bloody fight. I'm your Voodoo doll don't you hear my call. Trying so hard to forget, got my bottles, got my pills, got my TV set. I'm imprisoned by my passion, i;m a slave to my trade. How can you be so possessed by the profit that's been made. I live for love where love's insane, I need to numb to ease the pain. When the end begins again, needles, needles, I'm sticking them in. I'm your Voodoo doll, heed my call. I'm strung out on pretty, pretty girls, I forgot about the rest of the world. Pots and pans and good free sex my wife she is the best. If I get bored of her I'll have a family and get into incest. I live for love where love's insane, I need to numb to ease the pain. When the end begins again, needles, needles, I'm sticking them in. Think your thoughts, confirm your petty doubts,. The spell is cast in broken glass your time is running out. You're just a prisoner, sweet prisoner, you're just imprisoned by your own devices. Come on out and bleed some blood and solve this f*cking crisis. I live for love where love's insane, I need to numb to ease the pain. When the end begins again, needles, needles, I'm sticking them in. Voodoo doll, don't you hear my call. The big old world doesn't seem so f*cked up when I'm f*cked up too. Voodoo doll, don't you hear my call."
walking,"The sun's creeping up and stomping on my dreams. Works all right, party's fine, but sleeping is my scene. The traffic inside your head is tearing you apart. Stick your fingers down my throat and grab on to my heart. And I'm walking a little closer. Gonna rise up, take you away,. Sunday's just another day. Her eyes shine like oceans, her skin is like the earth. Suck the life out of her, you better take her for what she's worth. No free ride, this bus is going charter. So get up off you ass and try a little harder, try a little harder. Walkin' a little closer."
wandering eyes,Ever have I ever asked you. What is missing from this picture. That I painted for you yesterday. I say better late than never. You say nothing lasts forever. We say that it happens day to day. And it's all in the way that you look at it. That makes you look this way. It's all in the way you get used to it. That makes you go or stay. But nothing can stop this eyes form wandering (eyes) ..... Once I had a superstition I was on a secret mission. To make everyone see things my way. And it's all in the way that you look at it .... Oh yes I forgot to mention now that I've got your attention. I did not want you to see me this way. And it's all in the way that you look at it ....
we 3,"I was tapping my foot on a Friday night. To my favorite band I was pushed aside. I said ""hey don't push me no one pushes me"". When I was face to face with the woman I admired. And she gave me this look I could not believe. And the cold stare remained; I wanted to leave. See, I do believe anger is offset by sorrow. But you destroy today you might regret tomorrow. When you're young and defensive it comes off offensive. And it's hard to repay the tolerance that you borrowed. The lasting relationship sinks right off the pier. Who wears the pants; it's faded but clear. She's your girlfriend, seems she ain't too fond of me. I guess if that's the way it was meant to be. There we were, just we three. You, your girlfriend, and me. I've known you forever, you two just met. So easily amused; how fast we forget. In my jealously, my self-righteous greed. She's a bit like a book I'm too far sighted to read. And I wish you the best, I sometimes feel the need. To say remember me. She's your girlfriend, as far as we can see. Does she look at you the way she looks at me. And here we are, just we three. You, your girlfriend, and me. She's your girlfriend, it's getting harder to see. Better just take her home, better just let her be. When she walks out that door, you'll come looking for me."

without a trace,"I fell in love with a hooker. She laughed in my face. So seriously I took her. I was a disgrace. I was out of line. I was out of place. Out of time to save face. See the open mouth of my suitcase. Saying ""Leave this place.... Leave without a trace..."". Leave without a trace. I tried to get a good job. With honest pay. Might as well join the mob. The benefits are okay. Standing in the sun with a popsicle. Everything is possible. With a lot of luck and a pretty face. And some time to waste. Leave without a trace.... Leave without a trace.... I tried to dance at a funeral. New Orleans style. I joined the Grave Dancers Union. I had to file. Trying to do the right thing. Play it straight. The right thing changes from state to state. Don't forget to take your mace. If you're out working late. I liked to see your face. You left without a trace. Leave without a trace"

But we do. Some people don't like to dance. But we do. And if you don't wanna live, if you don't want to live I'll live for you.
