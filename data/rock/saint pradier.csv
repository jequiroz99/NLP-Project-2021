road to paradise,"Hey little girl I've been looking for you. You've told me all your secrets. why can't I stole you from here?. You have a tendency to burst when I'm around. And our fingers cross untangeble lines. For the eyes, and the soul. Chorus. Let's go find a place where all that matters. Is the road to paradise. Maybe that place. Is the road to ride. Hey little girl do you remember me?. I can't stop thinking about the reasons. that brought us here. Don't ask about a revolution. While there's a war killing thousands. in the core of your bed. In the core of your chest. Chorus. Let's go find a place where all that matters. Is the road to paradise. Maybe that place. Is the road to ride"
