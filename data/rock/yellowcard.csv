You won't hear me. You won't hear me. Why do we keep this up?. Why do we live like this?. When there is nothing left to save. Will you be afraid?. I am afraid right now. You already let me down.

Everybody here is living life in fear of falling out of line. Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts just to pass the time. And the eyes get red in the back of your head, this place will make you blind. Put it all behind me and I'll be just fine. Another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky. Sometimes I wish that it would rain here. And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes. There's nothing real for them to see here. Another starry night in Californ-i-a. I'm sure back home they'd love to see it. But they don't know that what you love is ripped away. Before you get a chance, before you get a chance to feel it."

crash the gates,"Something here, it never looks right. We've been fighting on the front lines for so long. I go digging in the graveyard. To find the remnants of your heart but it's gone!. And I won't wait for my revenge. I will seek to see the end. And I won't sing a battle cry. I will let the sleepless lie. Sing, ""oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"". Crash the gates, light a fire, and watch it burn!. Sing, ""oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"". Storm the walls, light a fire, and watch it burn!. Sing, ""oh oh oh"". Now it's crying all around us. Smoke rising from the ground up and I stare. You go digging in the graveyard. But the remnants of my heart are nowhere. And I won't crave to feel contempt. I will feed from these forget. And I won't claim a victory. I will revel silently. Sing, ""oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"". Crash the gates, light a fire, and watch it burn!. Sing, ""oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"". Storm the walls, light a fire, and watch it burn!. Sing, ""oh oh oh oh"". Sing, ""oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"". Crash the gates, light a fire, and watch it burn!. Sing, ""oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh"". Storm the walls, light a fire, and watch it burn!"

And give it one more try. I don't know if I would stay. I feel so much better now. And baby begging me. Will leave you so empty inside. So you shouldn't even try.

holly wood died,Accidents out on the highway to somewhere. They tell us about when we were young. Rescuers working to clean up the crashes. Before she can see what they've done. Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round. The last fight was fixed from the start. Name's on her side walks. They move through her body. Like razors they cut through her heart. Like razors they cut through her heart. Chorus. Hey let go. Of all you know. And get fired away now. What have you got to lose. And say out loud. These words I found. I'll be back when you come down. I'll be waiting for you. The night life. The high life. She just wants a good life. So someone remembers her too. But somewhere she heard there was some place to go when. You die when you live like we do. Die when you live like we do. Chorus. . (Por totteN)

Taking turns and never knowing where they lead. Do you picture me, what do you see?. Maybe a future full of on ramps. And thinking hope tonight from what's been done. Look for a future no one else has sung. Records on, the speakers blown. Fill the air with what we know. Climb a ladder up and hang a hopeful sign. Never lonely, never lost.

missing the war (cover),"All his crying, his tired eyes. See figures, jot it down. And clothes all strone around. The bedroom floor. Now nothing's adding up. And nothing's making sense.

Again, pissed at leaving. It's really no big deal. It happens all the time. It's no big deal. I'm missing the war. I'm missing the war. All night I am missing the war. I'm missing the war.

rock star land,"Christmas break of ninety eight just flipped me upside down. One coast out to the other, following the sound. Headed west to get the best of what we all knew then. One ocean to another, waves come crashing down. Carrying just me and Stephanie, she held my hand. Told me why, I, was. Blazing down that highway on my way to Rock Star Land. California, a place they say glistens gold.. I wanna go there and never come back home.. Staring up at freeway sings in dreams that make me sad. One coast out to the other. One ocean to another. We cruised out to the other side. Loved us in Nebraska how they cheered us in Mattane. Told me why if, I, was. Blazing down that highway on my way to Rock Star Land."

rough draft,"Like a Saturday night I'll be gone. Like a Saturday night I'll be,gone before you knew that I was there. So you wrote it down. I'm supposed be care. Even though it's never there. Sorry if I'm not prepared. Is it hard to see the things you substitute. For me and all my thoughts of you. It's eating me alive to leave you. Maybe it's childish and maybe it's wrong.

I'm finding my own words, my own little stage. My own epic drama, my own scripted page. I'll send you the rough draft, I'll seal it with tears. Maybe you'll read it and I'll reappear. From the start it was shaky and the characters rash,. A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last. All I have deep inside, to overcome this desire. Are friendly intentions and fairweather smiles. And I don't wanna be, don't wanna be wrong. You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song. Don't wanna be, don't wanna be wrong. You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song"

uphill both ways,"Everytime I try to read between the lines. I'm left wondering that I did so wrong. Everytime I try, try to rationalize. When everyone went wrong why didn't we die?. Everytime I think about what it would be like. without all the things you give to me. All these thoughts keep runnning thru my head. Nothing to beleive. Look back find the things I lost. There's nothing left there so it seems. Up hill both ways. Nothing left to say. I don't know how I made it this far. I don't know how I made it last this long. I don't know why I try. All these things keeps going thru my head. Don't know which way to turn. Each path goes up hill both ways. Nothing but dust. Since I learned, up hill both ways. Nothing left to say. I don't know how I made it this far. I don't know how I made it last this long. I don't know why I try. Up hill both ways. Nothing left to do now. I don't want nothing today"
view from heaven,"I'm just so tired. Wont you sing me to sleep. And fly through my dreams. So I can hitch a ride with you tonight. And get away from this place. Have a new name and face. I just aint the same without you in my life. Late night drives, all alone in my car. I can't help but start. Singing lines from all our favorite songs. And melodies in the air. Singin life just aint fair. Sometimes I still just can't believe you're gone. And im sure the view from heaven. Beats the hell out of mine here. And if we all believe in heaven,. Maybe we'll make it through one more year down here. Feel your fire,. When its cold in my heart. And things sorta start. Remindin' me of my last night with you. I only need one more day. Just one more chance to say. I wish that I had gone up with you too. And I'm sure the view from heaven. Beats the hell out of mine here. And if we all believe in heaven. Maybe we'll make it through one more year down here. You wont be comin' back. And I didn't get to say goodbye. I really wish I got to say goodbye. And im sure the view from heaven. Beats the hell out of mine here. And if we all believe in heaven. Maybe we'll make it through one more year. I hope that all is well in heaven. Cuz its all shot to hell down here. I hope that I find you in heaven. Cuz I'm so.... Lost without you down here. You wont be coming back. And I didn't get to say goodbye. I really wish I got to say gooooodbye"
violins,"I am just another fool, and I have to, keep telling myself that. I am just a hypocrit, and I have to, keep calling you one. And I forgot to bite my tongue, as my assumption, was the mother of all mistakes. So I assume the role, open my mouth, and clumsy words escape. So why you, wanna to be there, when you could be here, you are slipping away. I awake with your replacement, a bottle in my grasp, in an unfamiliar place. Because you put me out, the butt of a sick joke, into this ashtray life. As you come and go, and I forgot to service you, and we broke down. And you can't live with my mistakes, so I assume false grace. Open my arms and grasp at something true. How are you, how have you been, girl I miss you, wanna see you again. So why you, wanna to be there, when you could be here, you are slipping away. I bring out the worst in you, and you try to let me know. You bring out the worst in me, anxiety, anxiety. I'm trying to let you go, you say I'm giving you the creeps. So I assume the role, open my claws and grasp for your heart. How are you, how have you been, girl I miss you, wanna see you again. Into you like a mortal stake so vindictive. Your love's slipping away. Violins, into this ashtray life. Violins, the butt of your sick joke. Violins, I'm trying hard to let you go. Violins"
waiting game,"You and me. A little different. Though we tried to stay the same. It never leaves. And when it changes it is still a waiting game. I wait for a lonely breath. I wait to surface from this death. Wait for the light to come. And take away these images I get. In my head. Chorus. More than ever. I need to feel you. More than ever. I see the real you. You are me. A worst disaster would be waking up alone. Now we're free. We're drifting out. Like all the ones we didn't know. I wait for a silent tear. I wait for things to disappear. Wait for the ground to stop moving underneath my only fear. If I lose you I don't know. More than ever. I need to feel you. It's all around. More than ever. I see the real you. And it's around. Everything, everything. We've had. Out of sight out of mind. Given that. What I see when I dream. Hurts like hell and back. X2. Chorus. X2. . (Por totteN)"
way away,"I think I'm breaking out. I'm going to leave you now. There's nothing for me here, it's all the same. And even though I know. That everything might go. Go downhill from here, I'm not afraid. Way away away from here I'll be. Way away away so you can see. How it feels to be alone and not believe (Feels to be alone and not believe). Feels to be alone and not believe anything. You can't stop me now. You can't hold me down. You can't keep me here, I'm on my way. I've made it this far now. And I'm not burning out. No matter what you say, I'm not afraid. Way away away from here I'll be. Way away away so you can see. How it feels to be alone and not believe (Feels to be alone and not believe). Feels to be alone and not believe anything. Letting out the noise inside of me (Letting out the noise inside of me). Every window pane is shattering (Every window pane is shattering). Cutting up my words before I speak (Cutting up my words). This is how it feels to not believe. Letting out the noise inside of me (Letting out the noise inside of me). Every window pane is shattering (Every window pane is shattering). Cutting up my words before I speak (Cutting up my words). This is how it feels to not believe. Way away away from here I'll be. Way away away so you can see. How it feels to be alone and not believe (feels to be alone and not believe). Feels to be alone and not believe anything"
what appears,"Slow steady hands waving their last goodbye. They've come a long way. They've carried me. They've carried me through waking dreams. And soft whispered. Words echoing all this time. Speaking a strange tongue. But somehow I have recognized it all along. I turned myself blue. But forced my way through. And I'm still a kid looking for answers. I ended up wrong the faster I've gone. But I know I am finding the answers. Remembering every attempted flight. I don't want to stay here. I told myself I'd listen close. I filled my ears. The lone nights are long. Know you can understand. You just want to transform an empty stage. A fit of rage and you are born. I turned myself blue. But forced my way through. And I'm still a kid looking for answers. I ended up wrong the faster I've gone. But I know I am finding the answers. I am not what appears. I am failures and fears. But I'm on my way, I am on my way. I turned myself blue. But forced my way through. And I'm still a kid looking for answers. I ended up wrong the faster I've gone. But I know I am finding the answers. I am not what appears. I am failures and fears. But I'm on my way, I am on my way. Slow steady hands waving their last goodbye. They've come a long way. They've carried me. They've carried me through waking dreams"
when we're old men,"I've spent all of my time on the road. Sleeping my days away but you should know. That I'm reflecting on who I've let go. The people I've hurt in ways I'll never know. And I never meant to be hurtful to you. Please don't hate me. All I can say I did, All I could do. Please don't hate me for this. I've spent all of my nights wide awake. Wishing for some kind of poison to take. So that my conscience would just take a break. I am so tired of the noise that it makes. I'm guilty enough without hearing it twice. Please don't hate me. You won't give it up but it's all in your eyes. Please don't hate me for this. I've spent every second I've had. Counting the minutes and I'm going mad. I am redefining the words I am sad. Nothing I've done ever hurt quite this bad. And I'm sure that I will heal faster than you. Please don't hate me. I don't expect you to know what to do. Please don't hate me. When we're old men we will not be alone. Not be alone anymore (Not be alone). [x2]. . por caroleena parsons;"
with you around,"Do you remember when. I said you were my only one?. We were running underneath the California sun.. Well now I look at you,. And you're still more than I can take.. You're like a slow song, starting to accelerate.. And all my life, I looked for you.. For arms that I could fall into.. All I can think about is you and me. Driving with a Saves the Day record on,. We were singing till our voices were gone.. And I was falling hard. You were barely hanging on. And now I wanna chase forever down. With you around.. You're making movies in your head when you fall asleep.. Having nightmares, dreaming that I'm gonna leave.. I know you've always been afraid of ending up alone.. Somebody hurt you, now you're waiting on a dial tone.. But I'm right here, so dont get blue.. It's not just you, I need this too.. All I can think about is you and me. Driving with a Saves the Day record on,. We were singing till our voices were gone.. And I was falling hard. You were barely hanging on. And now I wanna chase forever down. With you around.. We were running underneath the California sun. Underneath the California sun. All I can think about is you and me. Driving with a Saves the Day record on,. We were singing till our voices were gone.. And I was falling hard. You were barely hanging on. We put a record on. Kept singing till our voices were gone.. And I was falling hard,. You were barely hanging on.. And now I wanna chase forever down. We were running underneath the California sun. I just wanna chase forever down. With you around."
"words, hands, hearts",The whole world was sleeping. And I was there. You could just sense this feeling in the air. Like no one's words were good enough to define what we feared. And no one's words were strong enough to fix what happened here. Lead on to save me. Or lead us all there. Find me some answers. One nation beware. Can't tell the difference between myth and man. Or what's necessary or where I should stand. The whole world is different now men have died. You could just sense this feeling in our eyes. Like no one's hands are big enough. To hold onto this fear. And no one's hands are strong enough to fix what happened here. Lead on to save me. Or lead us all there. Find me some answers. One nation beware. Can't tell the difference between myth and man. Or what's necessary or where I should stand. So do we dare now. Raise our voices loud. Were searching for something that cannot be found. Here open mouths. I see open hands. But their blinded and silent I can't understand. The whole word is watching with one blank stare. I could just sense this feeling of ill-repair. Like no one's heart is full enough. To keep away this fear. And no one's heart is strong enough to fix what happened here. Lead on to save me. Lead us all there. Find me some answers. Its time that you shared. Can't tell the difference between myth and man. Or what's necessary or where I should stand. So do we dare now. Raise our voices loud. We're searching for something that cannot be found. I hear open mouths. And I see open hands. But their blinded and silent I can't understand.. (Por totteN)
you and me and one spotlight,"It won't be long now. The music's on loud. We'll sing this song out. And then we'll lie down. I'll hold you close then. And let you know when. The space and time bend. And then we'll fall in.... Go put on your best tonight. Its you and me and one spotlight. One more show, one last time. We are ready(?). Say you will be all around me. When your body sets your heart free. Say you will be all around me. I look for your eyes to keep me inside. When everything dies but one last sunrise. And when we stand there. Together not scared. I'll dry your last tear. And then we'll just ?. Go put on your best tonight. Its you and me and not much time. To watch the world burnin bright. We are ready. Say you will be all around me. When your body sets your heart free. Say you will be all around me. Say you'll get me through the ending. Take my body, set my heart free. Say you'll get me through the ending. Go put on your best tonight. Its you and me and one spotlight. One more show, one last time. It wont be long now. Say you will be all around me. When your body sets your heart free. Say you will be all around me. Say you'll get me through the ending. Take my body, set my heart free. Say you'll get me through the ending. Say you will be (you wont be long). All around me (you wont be long now). by S15"
