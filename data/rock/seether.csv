careless whisper,I feel so unsure. As I take your hand. And lead you to the dance floor. As the music dies. Something in your eyes. Calls to mind a silver screen. And all it's sad goodbyes.

love her,I met a girl who hated the world. she used her body to sell her soul. everytime they'd break her and pay. tear out her heart and leave her in pain. I never found out how she survived. all of the sadness she kept inside. I never found out how she could lie. with a smile on her face. and the scratches she'd hide. Chorus:. You could love her if you paid. you could have her everyday. You could love her of you prayed. You have her every way. Down on her knees she bled on the floor. this hopeless life she wanted no more. Dead in her mind and cold to the bone. she opened her eyes and saw she was alone. She never found out how much I tried. all of the sadness she kept made me blind. she never found out how much I cried. the rope so tight on the night that she died. repete chorus. I never found out how she survived. a life lived in lies is a life of denial. I never found out how she could lie. with a smile on her face and the darkness inside. repete chorus(x2)

I am disappointment and I am no fun. How could this be misunderstood?. No-one will tell you why they smile as they berate you. They keep saying it's gonna be fine. No-one will help you as they constantly sedate you. They keep killing the grape on the vine. Singing your own praises constantly amazes. I don't wanna hear the words you're saying to me. How can I rephrase this?. You're all rats in mazes. constantly you're fighting over scraps of the cheese. Observing all your weakness. puddles have more deepness. empty vessels clamouring across the sea. Revel in your genius, eating clean and meatless. I'll be in the corner with my dignity.

simplest mistake,Watch it blow my mind. It's something I am ill-prepared to remedy. But let it slow the time. It takes to die and close your eyes to your enemy. Defy!. Self-made millionaires won't take ideas. From all the little plebeians just suffocate with smiles. And force fed lies. And close your mind to reality. Deny. It feels like I'm losing again. When I've lost everything. I'm sure I will see more clearly. Lose what I'm feeling to them. And not feeling anything. I'm sure I will bleed sincerely. Tonight!. So you make the simplest mistake. So you make the simplest mistake. And fearlessly you deny your involvement in my demise. But give me your open hand
skin the tiger,You think you know me. Tell me you're not wealthy. You still think you own me. Slide your mind's not healthy. You hate me. Like i do. You waste me. When i'll waste you. Your way to touch me. Your selfishness exceeds me. You can never reach me. Your fake smiles are all to easy. You hate me. Like i do. You waste me. When i'll waste. Your sister fakin. That bitch besides you paged me. Enouff for yourself right way toward me. Your a whore who keeps on helping. You hate me. Like i do. You waste me. When i'll you. You hate me (You hate me!). Like i do (Like i do!). You waste me (You waste me!). When i'll waste you. by emo_kid
sold me,"Well here I stand before myself. And I see somethings out of place. You've tasted all my purity. And now there's nothing left to waste. The feeling gets so in my way. It's getting lost in my delivery. The feeling gets so in my way. I'm getting lost in your periphery. Then you sold me up the river again. (i don't wanna be alone again). And you made me start all over again. (i don't wanna be alone again). You moved me, and soothed me, then you fought me. (i don't wanna be alone again). And you left me wondering what the hell. What is wrong with me?. I never felt like i had failed. Until the day you came undone. I never felt like I was lost. Until the day you killed me again. The feeling gets so in my way. It's getting lost in my delivery. The feeling gets so in my way. I'm getting lost in your periphery. Then you sold me up the river again. (i don't wanna be alone again). And you made me start all over again. (i don't wanna be alone again). You moved me, and soothed me, then you fought me. (i don't wanna be açlone again). And you left me wondering what the hell. What is wrong with me?. Are you stronger. For cutting me open. Are you stronger. For leaving me broken. Then you sold me up the river again. (i don't wanna be alone again). And you made me start all over again. (i don't wanna be alone again). You moved me, and soothed me, then you fought me. (i don't wanna be alone again). And you left me wondering what the hell.

Tell me how you fake it. Tell me how you love me. Doing it to myself. God it's overrated. Feeling so degraded. Tell me how you love me. [Verse 2]. I've become so good at telling lies. Express emotions with my knife. It's far too late to apologize. Another pill just to keep me fine. [Chorus]. Tell me how you hate it. Tell me how you fake it. Tell me how you love me. Doing it to myself. God it's overrated. Feeling fuckin' jaded. Tell me how you love me now. [Bridge]. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Doing it to myself. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Doing it to myself. [Instrumental]. [Outro]. 'Cause I want something else. And I don't need your help. 'Cause I want something else (feeling fuckin' jaded). And I don't need your help (feeling fuckin' jaded)"

tied my hands,Can you remember when we used to cry. But never in distress. Or can you picture. When we used to pride ourselves on neatness. Cause I can’t understand what you mean to me. You made me wild and then you tied my hands. Can you remember when we used to laugh. ‘Bout those mistakes we’d made. Or can you picture then. How we used to drive. And never reach the end. But since you went away. It made me find. I had nothing to say
tongue,"Well the tongue inside my mouth is not for sale. Any spirit left in me is fading fast. Could you throw another stone to ease my pain?. Could you throw another stone to seal my fate?.

Can anybody save me?. Second chances are too few and far between. Will to change this circumstance eludes me still. Should I grow another shell in which to live?. Should I grow another shell and not forgive?. 'Cause I don't believe in this world anymore, anymore. I don't believe in me. Goodbye cruel world. Goodbye cruel world. Goodbye cruel world at last you se me drown. Goodbye cruel world"
