dead in the water,"For the shore as the night is slipping through my hands. I fall into the sea like the empire built on the sand. I've been thinking 'bout the days when we had no money. That photograph of you, well it still seems funny. Gotta get back to the promised land. So don't walk away love. There's never enough. that could make me crash on the broken glass.

the death of you and me,High tide - summer in the city. The kids are looking pretty. But isn't it a pity that the sunshine. Is followed by thunder. With thoughts of going under. And is it any wonder why the sea's. Been calling out to me?. I seem to spend my whole life running. From people who will be. The death of you and me. And I can feel the storm clouds sucking. Up my soul. Hard times - life is getting faster. And no one has the answer. I try to face the day now in a new way. At the bottom of a bottle. Is every man's apostle. Let's run away together you and me. Forever we'd be free. Free to spend our whole lives running. From people who would be. The death of you and me. 'Cause I can feel the storm clouds. Sucking up my soul. Let's run away to sea. Forever we'd be free. Free to spend our whole lives running. From people who will be. The death of you and me. 'Cause I can feel the storm clouds coming. I'm watching my Tv. Or is it watching me?. I see another new day dawning. It's rising over me with my mortality. And I can feel the storm clouds. Sucking up my soul

while the song remains the same,"Hold that thought. Don't let me go. We can dance beneath. The fireflies on an empty road. It's a shame how a memory fades to grey. We let love get lost in anger, chasing yesterday. Find me a place where the sun shines through the rain. Find me the pleasure in the pain. While the song remains the same. Let it go on and on and on. Taking you back. To the town where I was born. 'Cause I'm tired of being a stranger. And I'm miles from home. We can hide by a lonely window pane. We can walk the streets of my life while they still remain. Find me a place where the sun shines through the rain. Find me the pleasure in the pain. While the song remains the same. Let it go on and on and on. Hold that thought. Don't let me go. We can dance beneath the. Fireflies on an empty road"

Put another record record on the jukebox. She might dance the night away. On and on we go. And the rest of the world outside. God may soon explode. And there is no place we might hide. (x2).

She heard me jingle jangling. Like a memory that fades. She slipped away again. 'Cause in a little while, she'll be gone. (The riverman runs!)"

I'm on the side of the angels. If I die in a dream. Then let me live my life. But all the lies. They have told me. They make me want to shiver. When I'm lost and I'm lonely. That's not going to ease my troubled mind. She's rolling over. A misty morning. Set the sail for where the four winds blow. She a siren. And I'm a warning. Hear to say I never told you so. Leave me in peace. I'm on the side of the angels. If I die in a dream. Then let me live my life. But all the lies they have told me. They make me want to shiver. When I'm lost and I'm lonely.

Still recall the way you were. And that look in your eyes. You could leave when the walls fall down. I can tell by the look in your eyes. You're alone on the rope. And if you can't find no hope. Don't look down. Don't look down. You could leave when the wall falls down. I can tell by the look in your eyes. You're alone on the rope. And if you can't find no hope. Don't look down. Don't look down
ballad of the mighty i,"Followed you down to end of the earth. To wait outside your window. At the feet of the rain I'll call your name. You just pass me by. You put me up like a fly on the wall. You lead the blame where the heavens fall. Give me a sign, if you hear me you call. You just pass me by. The colours around me are fading away. And I'll be waiting, come what may. I'll find you, yes I'll find you. If I gotta be the man who walks the earth alone. Follow the stars and I'll sail to the sun. Feel it in my fingers. Alone on the beach. On my own out of reach. And you just pass me by. I'll give you the word if you take my hand. But you left me alone in the sinking sand. Strike up the band for one last stand. You just pass me by. Show me the rules I'll be engaging in play. I'll be waiting come what may. I'll find you, yes I'll find you. If I gotta be the man who walks the earth. I'll find you. Yes I'll find you. Followed you down to end of the earth. To wait outside your window. At the feet of the rain I'll call your name. You just pass me by. Wherever you run I'll be on your tail. Wherever you hide if you have your way. I'll find you, yes I'll find you... Etc"

'Cause you're standing on the outside. They'll never let you in. They'll let you play the game, son. But they'll never let you win. Never let them bare witness. To the tears in your eyes. And never take a handshake. From the prophets and their lies. 'Cause they put you in the wrong line. You've been crying out for more. They've given you the key, son. But you'll never find the door. You've fallen like an angel. Stranded on the earth. They let you see their riches. They never tell you what you're worth. They've put you in the back seat. While they're heading for the sun. And if you're waiting for the rapture. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come. The day will never come"

let the lord shine a light on me,When I feel like a drop in the ocean. But there’s no one else at sea. And my body's bent and broken. Let the lord shine a light on me. Now the voices in the distance. Trying to sing their soul to sleep. Then I’m drifting in the silence. Let the lord shine a light on me. Let the lord shine a light on me. If I raise you up to the top of the mountain. Made you tell me what he seen. And I'm standing on this island. Did the lord shine a light on me?. Did the lord shine a light on me?. Did the lord shine a light on me?
lock all the doors,"She wore a star-shaped tambourine. Prettiest girl I had ever seen. Standing lost and lonely on the shore. I try to catch her every night. Dancing on her own in her candlelight. But I can't seem to reach her anymore. Lock all the doors!. Maybe they'll never find us. I can be sure, like I never before, this time. Get down on the floor!. Turn all the lights off inside. I can be sure, like I never before, this time. You know it's mine!. You know it's mine!. She never hears me when I speak. I gotta find out where that magic sleeps. And I can feel you underneath my skin. And if we take our love inside. 'Cause I don't wanna sail on the ocean wide. 'Cause we might never live to meet again. Lock all the doors!. Maybe they'll never find us. I can be sure, like I never before, this time. Get down on the floor!. Turn all the lights off inside. I can be sure, like I never before, this time. You know it's mine!. You know it's mine!"
oh lord,Oh Lord! Is that you by the side of the road?. Still preaching the words of your code. As you jump up and down like a toad. You tried but you can't shoot your load. Oh Lord! Is that you with your head in the sand?. In a world that you don't understand. Have you ruined your best laid plans. Could they just turn to shit in your hands. Oh Lord! Is that you who is fading away?. Like the truth in the lies that they say. And the hair on your hands turns gray. You remind me of yesterday
revolution song,They took my faith. Put it in a headlock and. They sealed my fate. Somewhere inside of the world in which I live. Because I failed. They constantly ignore me and. They told me I lost my mind. But I believe that I rule the world. And I'm singing out my revolution song. Like nothing else matters. You can pitch your gold against my soul.

riverman,"There's something in the way. She moves me, to distraction. I travelled all this way to try and make amends. 'Cause heavy in the air. Are the words that she left hanging. I tried to walk away, but I only stand and stare. The rain that comes. All of the love that was left behind is gone. When the riverman runs. Find me the girl who electrifies the storm. 'Cause in a little while, she'll be gone. I waited in the rain. My feet too wet to stand in. I shouted out your name. Behind the rainbow's end. But somewhere in the crowd. She heard me jingle jangling. Like a memory that fades. She slipped away again. 'Cause in a little while, she'll be gone. (The riverman runs!)"
sad song,"Sing a sad song. In a lonely place. Try to put a word in for me. It's been so long. Since I found this place. You better put in two or three. We as people, are just walking 'round.

You know that I would give you my hand. Or a sad song. In a lonely place. I'll try to put a word in for you. Need a shoulder? well if that's the case. You know there's nothing I wouldn't do. Where we're living in this town. The sun is coming up and it's going down. But it's all just the same at the end of the day. When we cheat and we lie. Nobody says it's wrong. So we don't ask why.
