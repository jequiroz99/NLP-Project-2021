smooth (feat. rob thomas),"Man it's a hot one. Like seven inches from the midday sun. I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone. But you stay so cool. My muñequita, my Spanish harlem Mona Lisa. You're my reason for reason. The step in my groove. And if you say this life ain't good enough. I would give my world to lift you up. I could change my life to better suit your mood. Cause you're so smooth. And it's just like the ocean under the moon. Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you. You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth. Give me your heart, make it real. Or else forget about it. I'll tell you one thing. If you would leave it'd be a crying shame. In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out. Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio. You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow. Turning you round and round. And if you say this life ain't good enough. I would give my world to lift you up. I could change my life to better suit your mood. Cause you're so smooth. And it's just like the ocean under the moon. Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you. You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth. Give me your heart, make it real. Or else forget about it.

I tell you I’ve been here before. When it’s movin this fast. It's a matter of time. One of us walks out that door. It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things. I always feel alive when the death bell rings. Now you come and you bring out the tears in me. Give this some thought. And I’m sure you will know. This is the way it must be. Emotions will rise, emotions will flow. You bring out the tears in me. It's so strange to watch your life walk and where everyday. I've been burning the candle at both ends. And lied the truth I can’t pretend. This is why I will not stay baby. Just like that I’m on my way."

brown skin girl,"feat. Bo Bice. She's a force of nature. That I can't outrun. A devil and a savior all in one. Her eyes can heal me. Or they can make me bleed. Her lips have me addicted to the poetry. Never really knowing just who I am. And I confess that I don't mind at all. Cause I would trade the world away. To stay inside this dream. I'll never find a better place to fall. [Chorus:]. I got a lover, a brown skin girl. She's got a magic of another world. And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire - fire. She knows a way, a spirtual flow. Of making me dizzy like vertigo. Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire, yeah. I get a strong vibration. When she just says my name. And it drives me crazy. 'Cause I don't know if she feels the same. But she likes to breathe some mystery in all she does. She laughs and says that I'm under her spell. Now I won't lie. I enjoy the ride. And pray it never ends. I feel her deeper than anything I've felt. [Chorus]. I can't help but crave another taste of her. Like a drowning man that's praying for the rain. And how she worked her way inside. I'll never understand. She's too beautiful to ever take the blame. But she'll always fan the flame. [Chorus]"

gumbo,There's a mouse starin' out of the window. His car is trapped in the snow. He's planning a family vacation. But he just can't go. Around the next corner's a red bird. His feathers are trapped in a sling. He's passed by some gunslinging parrot. Who's jealous he ain't got no grin. There ain't no time to stash the gumbo. Or rattle around in a cage. The sacrificed child's made bubbles. And spittle is everywhere enraged. In a hot sand or in a my feet. They're blistered and caked with debris. Chez rolez is guarding the tote board. While angry piddles with glee. There's a fool writing notes out on sandpaper. He's sending them off to himself. He gets them a couple days later. Who put them along his top shelf. If you get tired of shavings. And carve up a good hunk of wood. Remembering to check on the sausage. He's got cooking somewhere look good

Oh how I'd like to hold her near. And kiss and forever whisper in her ear. I love you gypsy woman. All through the caravan. She was dancing with all the men. Waiting for the rising sun. Everyone was having fun. I hate to see the lady go. Knowing she'll never know. That I love her. That I love her. She danced around and round. To a guitar melody. From the fire her face. Was all aglow. How she enchanted me. Oh how I'd like to hold her near. And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

night hunting time,Drunk all the whiskey. But I still canâ€™t get no rest. Brain trapped on a roller coaster. Got a pain in my chest. Cold water on my eyeballs. Send a shiver up my spine. Hit the street in the wee wee hours. This is the night hunting time. . CHORUS:. Donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing here. Donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing here. Got to get my senses clear. . Stumble in off the footpath. Heard the sounds from below. Get accustomed to the darkness. Got to take it real slow. Sweat streaminâ€™ down my cheekbones. Smoke stinginâ€™ my eyes. Walls drippinâ€™ like the jungle. But this ainâ€™t no paradise. . CHORUS. . Stumble up to the counter. Catch the tension in the air. Black Sabbath drive a young boy crazy. This ainâ€™t no frivolous affair. Young girl sipping Pernod. Budy hunger in her glance. No stoppinâ€™ when it comes to doinâ€™. The Heavy Metal Romance

smoke on the water,"We all came out to Montreaux. On the Lake Geneva shoreline. To make records with a mobile. We didn't have much time. Frank Zappa and the Mothers. Were at the best place around. But some stupid with a flare gun. Burned the place to the ground. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water. They burned down the gambling house. It died with an awful sound. Funky Claude was running in and out. Pulling kids out the ground. When it all was over. We had to find another place. But Swiss time was running out. It seemed that we would lose the race. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water. We ended up at the Grand Hotel. It was empty, cold and bare. But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside. Making our music there. With a few red lights and a few old beds. We made a place to sweat. No matter what we get out of this. I know, I know we'll never forget. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. Smoke on the water"

Give me your heart, make it real. Or else forget about it. I'll tell you one thing. If you would leave it'd be a crying shame. In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out. Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio. You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow. Turning you round and round. And if you say this life ain't good enough. I would give my world to lift you up. I could change my life to better suit your mood. Cause you're so smooth. And it's just like the ocean under the moon.

And slowly I begin to realize this is never going to end. Right about the same you walk by. And I say 'Oh here we go again'. When's this ever going to break?. I think I've handled more than any man can take. I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around. And it's alright. Bouncing round from cloud to cloud. I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down. If said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied. [Pre Chorus - repeat]

why don't you & i (feat. alex band),"Since the moment I spotted you. Walking 'round with little wings on my shoes. My stomach's filled with the butterflies. And it's alright. Bouncing round from cloud to cloud. I got the feelin' like I'm never gonna come down. If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied. But every time I try to talk to you. I get tongue-tied. Turns out, everything I say to you. Comes out wrong and never comes out right. So I'll say why don't you and I get together an' sing on the world. and be together forever.

wings of grace,"WINGS OF GRACE (The Dreamers). What shall we do with the dreames. Who see a world we can never know. Who have found a place of wonder. Where only children dare to go. What shall we do with the dreames. Whose world has no room for hate. Whose vision of tomorrowæŠ¯ promise. Is so far removed from our fate. For they dream of a thousand tomorrows. Each one better than the one before. A future filled with compassion. For the tired, the weak, the hungry and the poor. What shall we do with the dreamers. Who no longer answer when we ask why. Who work to make their world better. And are unefraid to try. What whall we say to the dreamers. Whose lives make ours seem so bare. Who make us feel so empty. Because they dare to care. For they dream not of thing done before. But of the miracles which lie ahaid. Of the needy who can be assisted. And the famshed who can be fed. What shall we make of the dreamers. When they choose not to live as we. When they say our world has no meaning. As long as others are still not free. What shall we think of the dreamers. When they no longer listen to what we say. When their silence leaves us uneasy. And they refuse to go away. For they dream of fanciful figures. Poised in mid-flight. Angels with Wings of Grace. Floating on the light. Messengers from the next world. So unfamiliar but yet not strange. Bringing word of the New World. The begginnin of the change."
winning,One day I was on the ground. When I needed a hand. And it couldn't be found. I was so far down. That I couldn't get up. You know and. One day I was one of life's losers. Even my friends were my ac-cus-ers. And in my head. Lost before I'd begun. I had a dream. But it turned to dust. What I thought was love. That must have been lust. I was living in style. When the walls fell in. When I played my hand. I looked like a joker. Turn around. Fate must have woke her. 'Cause lady luck she was. Waiting outside the door. (Chorus:). I'm winning. I'm winning. I'm winning. And I don't intend on losing again. Too bad it belonged to me. It was the wrong time. And I meant to be. It took a long time. And I knew for now. I can see the day. That I breath for. Friends agree there's a need. To play the game. And to win again. (Chorus:). (repeat first line 5x's). (repeat last line 4x's). (Repeat Verse II). (Chorus)
wishing it was,"Beauty and grace is what touches me most. Good time can put me in fear. Always feel safe when things are bad. So I cannot let you come near. It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things. I always feel alive when the death bell rings. Now you have come and bring out the tears in me. Pain never makes me cry, but happiness does. It's so strange to watch my life go by. Wishing it was. Wishing it was more like a fantasy. Where everyone surprises me. Wishing it was. This feeling won’t last cause I cannot survive. I tell you I’ve been here before. When it’s movin this fast. It's a matter of time. One of us walks out that door. It seems that I thrive on the dark side of things. I always feel alive when the death bell rings. Now you come and you bring out the tears in me. Give this some thought. And I’m sure you will know. This is the way it must be. Emotions will rise, emotions will flow. You bring out the tears in me. It's so strange to watch your life walk and where everyday. I've been burning the candle at both ends. And lied the truth I can’t pretend. This is why I will not stay baby. Just like that I’m on my way."

And when the morning comes. You take me by the hand. And say our love is written in sand. Written in sand. . We hear the ocean roar. Weâ€™re swept away on to some. Distant shore.

Nothing lies between. A woman and a man. When their love is written in sand. When their love is written in sand."
