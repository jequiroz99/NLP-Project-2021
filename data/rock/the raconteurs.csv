That were given to him when he was young. And a drunk temper that was easy to lose. And thank god he didn't own a gun. Well, Billy woke up in the back of his truck. Took a minute to open his eyes. He took a peep into the back of the house. And found himself a big surprise. He didn't see his brother but there was his mother. With her red-headed head in her hands. While the boyfriend had his gloves wrapped around an old priest. Trying to choke the man. Ah Ah Ahhh.... Billy looked up from the window to the truck. Threw up, and had to struggle to stand. He saw that red-necked bastard with a hammer. Turn the priest into a shell of a man. The priest was putting up the fight of his life. But he was old and he was bound to lose.

He looked dead into the boyfriend's eye. His mother was a ghost, too upset to cry, then. He took a step toward the man on the ground. From his mouth trickled out a little audible sound. He heard the boyfriend shout, ""Get out!"". And Billy said, ""Not till I know what this is all about"". ""Well, this preacher here was attacking your mama"". But Billy knew just who was starting the drama. So Billy took dead aim at his face. And smashed the bottle on the man who left his dad in disgrace, and. The white milk dripped down with the blood, and the. Boyfriend fell down dead for good. Right next to the preacher who was gasping for air. And Billy shouted, ""Daddy, why'd you have to come back here?"". His mama reached behind the sugar and honey, and. Pulled out an envelope filled with money. ""Your daddy gave us this,"" she collapsed in tears. ""He's been paying all the bills for years"".
