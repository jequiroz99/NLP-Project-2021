alone in a room,"I've been away, a little while. Sometimes I just can't help myself. When my mind's running wild. I seem to lose grip on reality. And I try to disregard the crazy things. The voices tell me to do, but it's no use. I tried to own it, write songs about it. Believe me I tried. In the end I needed to breathe. Find inspiration, some kind of purpose. To take a second to face the shit. That makes me, me. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud. Every moment, every second, every trespass. Every awful thing, every broken dream. A couple years back and forth. With myself in a cage. Banging my head against the wall. Tryna put words on a page. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room, alone in a room. I saw the world a couple times. Tried to cure the ache with absence. But that hole was still a hole. And my mind kept playing tricks on me. Feeling older every day. Took everything I had to not crash and burn. But I'm starting to learn. Sometimes I'll fall down. Sometimes I'll lose hope. But those days will be few. If I keep my feet on the ground. I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here. So I keep pushing the limits of what makes me. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud. Every moment, every second, every trespass. Every awful thing, every broken dream. A couple years back and forth. With myself in a cage. Banging my head against the wall. Tryna put words on a page. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room, alone in a room. I can be better than I was. I can be better than I am. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud. Every moment, every second, every trespass. Every awful thing, every broken dream. A couple years back and forth. With myself in a cage. Banging my head against the wall. Trying to put words on a page. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room, alone in a room"
into the fire,"Take them all back. Take them all back. Take them all back. I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do with this. These hands, this mind, this instability. From a cage I created, to a hell that heaven made. Can't let go of the hatred. cause I love the way it tastes. Take them all back. I wouldn't take back a moment. Not one miserable moment. I'll give it all 'til there's nothing. I'd walk into the fire. Into the fire. I'd walk into the fire. Into the fire. Into the fire. I've come to terms with the fact I'll never change. And that's just fine, I find solace in the pain. I don't mind the darkness. it's easy on the eyes. I'm praying for something to make me feel alive. I wouldn't take back a moment. Not one miserable moment. I'll give it all 'til there's nothing. I'd walk into the fire. Into the fire. I'd walk into the fire. Into the fire. Into the fire. I'm a paranoid, sycophant. Masochistic dilettante. Narcissistic elephant in the room. I'm the end of the world. Thinning the herd. The all around outta my mind, fucking absurd. I am gone. I am gone. I wouldn't take back a moment. I'd walk into the fire. Into the fire. I'd walk into the fire. Into the fire. Into the fire. Fire. Take them all back!"
moving on,"A boy of anguish now, he's a man of soul. Traded in his misery. For the lonely life of the road. The years were cruel to him, no. He will let them go. Lays awake tryna find the man inside. to back his bugs and escape this world. I've never been so torn up in all of my life. I should've seen this coming. I've never felt so hopeless. Than I do tonight. No, I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on. He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile. So he put his pen to paper. And poured out everything inside. He's read the scene. And unpacked the man that he had became. So leave him trailing on the fast track. To falling into his grave. II've never been so torn up in all of my life. I should've seen this coming. I've never felt so hopeless. Than I do tonight. No, I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on. I can't believe. I've come so far in such a time. And I'm still fighting on my own. I fucked up to catch my breath. I may never breathe again, so just notice. I've never been so torn up in all of my life. I can't believe I let myself breakdown. I've never been so torn up in all of my life. I should've seen this coming. I've never felt so hopeless. Than I do tonight. No, I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on.

killing you,"You loved me for all the wrong reasons. There's nothing but pain left, I know. What's killing me is that I'm killing you. Three years of torment and torturous love. Stained with tears and mistrust. Enough is enough. I can't hold you any longer in this hell I'm in. Cause your heart is too weak for me to break it again. All the mistakes that I've made. You forgave, what the fuck? You shouldn't have stayed. You'd always said ""there's so much love in you"". I can't believe that you can't see that. You loved me for all the wrong reasons. I'm not the same I used to be. There's nothing but pain left, I know. What's killing me is that I'm killing you. Do you remember the beginning?. Heartbeats one and the same?. Living smitten in texas. Burning bright as a flame. So young and in love. No care what anyone said. 'Til my soul grew cold and my heart turn dead. What went so wrong with me?. Why did I break this?. Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see. That we were perfect 'til I turned around. And gave in to debauchery. This is your chance to escape this, my goodbye. With a last kiss. Yeaah!. 'Cause I know deep down you know that. You loved me for all the wrong reasons. I'm not the same as I used to be. There's nothing but pain left, I know. What's killing me is that I'm killing you. You loved me for all the wrong reasons. I'm not the same as I used to be. There's nothing but pain left, I know. What's killing me is that I'm killing you"

Still shitting, sleeping, eating, breathing it. Then years and you're still hanging. On my every word with baited breath. After a decade pushing boundaries. Proving impossible possible. Making something from nothing. Creating ""larger than life"". Always rejecting the herd. Always ahead of the curve. Writing the records your favorite band rip off. In their records. You're all so fucking outrageous. I can't take it. Motherfuckers more than a little complacent. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?. Just sit the fuck down, pay attention. There's too much noise, for a second listen. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?. There was the first one, the triple gold one. The stole by every fucking band on summer tours one. Then there's the second one, the living reckless one. The knock the pop stars off the charts one. And the third one, the fuck the world one. The arenas singing every fucking word one. Then was a fourth one, the wasn't me one. The we needed just a little space to breathe one. But now there's this one, the I'm the king one. The I don't care, I'm gonna do my thing one. The breaking every fucking rule in book one. The fuck you all. This shit is fucking outrageous. I can't take it. Motherfuckers more than a little complacent.

Don't have to like it, but you can't deny. You needed me to show you what comes next. I've set the standard far too high. For you to follow me. Feel free to try your best. You're all so fucking outrageous. I can't take it. Motherfuckers more than a little complacent. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?. Just sit the fuck down, pay attention.

hopelessly hopeful,"Staring eyes wide open gazing into nothing. Running in place again. Going through the motions. In and out as the oceans, repeating. Numb to the silence. To the absence of emotion, the sum of the script. Nothing but a click in the rotation. Sick of the peace of mind. That goes along with keeping on. And I can't keep on keeping on. Inside it feels like I'm stuck here. Suspended, at best underwhelming. What's wrong with me?. My conscious is calling. But the world isn't all it's cracked up to be. I'm hopelessly hopeful. That I'm not stuck here suspended. In a world I pretended was right for me. Strung out on the same old. Got an itch for something painful. To feel something real once. To remind myself it's not in my head. Sick of the calm coinciding. With sticking in and with the line. Can't keep on keeping on. It all just feels like I'm stuck here. Suspended, at best underwhelming. What's wrong with me?. My conscious is calling. But the world isn't all it's cracked up to be. I'm hopelessly hopeful. That I'm not stuck here suspended.

alone in a room,"I've been away, a little while. Sometimes I just can't help myself. When my mind's running wild. I seem to lose grip on reality. And I try to disregard the crazy things. The voices tell me to do, but it's no use. I tried to own it, write songs about it. Believe me I tried. In the end I needed to breathe. Find inspiration, some kind of purpose. To take a second to face the shit. That makes me, me. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud. Every moment, every second, every trespass. Every awful thing, every broken dream. A couple years back and forth. With myself in a cage. Banging my head against the wall. Tryna put words on a page. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room, alone in a room. I saw the world a couple times. Tried to cure the ache with absence. But that hole was still a hole. And my mind kept playing tricks on me. Feeling older every day. Took everything I had to not crash and burn. But I'm starting to learn. Sometimes I'll fall down. Sometimes I'll lose hope. But those days will be few. If I keep my feet on the ground. I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here. So I keep pushing the limits of what makes me. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud. Every moment, every second, every trespass. Every awful thing, every broken dream. A couple years back and forth. With myself in a cage. Banging my head against the wall. Tryna put words on a page. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room, alone in a room. I can be better than I was. I can be better than I am. All I needed was the last thing I wanted. To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud. Every moment, every second, every trespass. Every awful thing, every broken dream.

dedication,"You'll never really find those perfect words,. Something more than just... 'goodbye'.. It's hard to remember the good times. When there's just so much heartache,. But they deserve more than that.. They deserve more than just one single moan of sadness. So, just remember; that when there's enough love. In that heart to burst like a fucking supernova,. Then there sure is hell enough love in that heart. To smile that famous smile.. We all lose someone at somepoint in our lives,. But don't ever let go of that smile,. Or they're gone forever.. Because that's a final dedication."

the irony of your perfection,"One chance. One shot. One bullet in the back of my head. And it came from the bottom of your heart. You couldn't find the words to tell me. So you went and found some bullets and shot me. What better than the kiss of a 9mm. To promote the heartbreak?. Goodbye to the paramour notes. We used to be such a finely scripted romance. But now you're all alone in watching me drown in our. Last tragedy that you so proudly painted. Oh God, how the bullet meets my lung. Just like the love it takes my breath away. Oh God, well now it's ended. But the last laugh belongs to me; listen up. This is my bullet of envy. This mess, the cracks in your heart. That's what you've created. This the heartache that only you've invented. Oh God, how the bullet meets my lung. Just like the love it takes my breath away. You're pulling the trigger, pacing the bullet against my heart. Screaming the point 4 so I can have a head start to exit. But I'll break back through with my bullet of envy. My bitter revenge before your sweet tragedy. Oh God, pull the trigger. Oh God, the pull of a trigger. Say something more. To preach the sudden silence. My last words before your. Gunshot"
the lost souls,"We are the ones that no one gave a chance. We are the ones that almost lost it all. Ghosts in the hallway who never catch a glance. We are the lost. We are the lost souls. Our hearts, our souls are shallow empty holes. We sing this anthem for us all. We're fucked up. Oh god we're so alone. just close your eyes and sing along. if my heart stops beating, will you still remember?. Will you still remember my name?. Did I get what I deserved?. We're trapped in doubt. In our own minds. Ignoring all we feel inside. Forsaken. Gone. Forgotten. Everything has come apart. Lead us back from out the dark. Our hearts, our souls - are shallow empty holes. We sing the anthem for us all. We're fucked up. Oh god we're so alone. just close your eyes and sing along. Let's go. We sing this anthem for us all. Let's go. We sing this anthem for us all. We are the lost souls"
the match,"Gather round my friends. I need a match and only one match (I need a match). I think it's time I make my own way. I'm turning my back on this city. And I'm not looking back. You'll never hear my name. Without your chest in flames. I'll make my own mistakes. Even though I never learn. I'm running from myself. If only you could see behind my eyes. Run. Get up, get up. Get on your fucking feet. [x2]. Get up, get up. Get up, get up. Get up!. I'll make my own mistakes. Even though I never learn. I'm running from myself. If only you could see behind my eyes. Follow me now I could use some company. Bring your friends and we'll burn the city to the ground. Follow me now I could use some company. Bring your friends and we'll burn the city to the fucking ground. Burn their temples. Burn their temples. The fires fill the skies. As the smoke fills my lungs. What a beautiful notion. A single action brings the city to motion. You all deserve to die!"
the road,"Street signs, so many street signs. Pass me by every night. And I know tomorrow I won't recognize the world. Home bound, but I want to be home now. Two more months of empty faces. Standing there screaming up at me. And I don't know why. I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed. I want a normal life again. Is this the end? Is this the end?. No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road. All I know is the road. Save me, can anyone save me?. I don't know who I am anymore. This was supposed to be the dream. You don't see the pain in my eyes?. You don't hear the pain in my words?. I'm just stuck here cold. And alone with no one beside me. And I wanna go home. I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed. I want a normal life again. Is this the end? Is this the end?. No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road. All I know is the road. And you wonder why I'm out of my mind?. I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed. I want a normal life again. Is this the end? Is this the end?. No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road. All I know is the road"

until the end (feat. howard jones),This isn't me any more. I need something to believe in. If you think you've seen the last of me. The flat line has come and gone. But won't take me away. I'm tortured. By this dream I've manufactured. War torn. From the inside out but it makes me stronger. I'm not the person you see. When you look into these eyes. I've got a reason. To believe in something more. I know there's something more. I've heard it all before. But I won't sing my last song. 'Til I'm flat out on the floor. I've longed for so much more. I wanna be the best that I can be. I'm sick and tired of being admired. I don't deserve this pedestal you've put me on. All I want is to be proud of who I am. I brought this hell upon myself. Now I gotta see it through 'til the end
we'll be ok,"Your voice is calling my name. Again and again. The web you wove around me was only the beginning. And every star I counted, as cold as your embrace. I've listened - I have questioned. Every word you choked on. The secret - The answer. I'm just a slave to all your sins. If I've been so stupid. So blind, so void, so empty. I hope you forgive me. I'm just a echo in your head. You made my life a f**king misery. Remember when you tied me down. Yeah, I sank in the unvertainty. I prayed for you to blindfold me. f**k. I'm just so scared of what I'll see. Your voice is callind my name. My soul is caught up in flames. I feel I'm loos control. I'm here, I'm yours to atone. Again and again. f**k - Oh No - God. Mesmerized by your motion. But my memories of you forever standing still. Your voice is calling my name. My soul is caught up in flames. I feel I'm loosing control. I'm here, I'm yours to atone. Again and again.

where did it go?,"So you're all stars now?. So you're what's ""in"" now. Top of the world now?. So you're the kings?. There's only one throne and I'm not done with it. Still shitting, sleeping, eating, breathing it. Then years and you're still hanging. On my every word with baited breath. After a decade pushing boundaries. Proving impossible possible. Making something from nothing. Creating ""larger than life"". Always rejecting the herd. Always ahead of the curve. Writing the records your favorite band rip off. In their records. You're all so fucking outrageous. I can't take it. Motherfuckers more than a little complacent. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?. Just sit the fuck down, pay attention. There's too much noise, for a second listen. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?. There was the first one, the triple gold one. The stole by every fucking band on summer tours one. Then there's the second one, the living reckless one. The knock the pop stars off the charts one. And the third one, the fuck the world one. The arenas singing every fucking word one. Then was a fourth one, the wasn't me one. The we needed just a little space to breathe one. But now there's this one, the I'm the king one. The I don't care, I'm gonna do my thing one. The breaking every fucking rule in book one. The fuck you all. This shit is fucking outrageous. I can't take it. Motherfuckers more than a little complacent. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?. Just sit the fuck down, pay attention. There's too much noise, for a second listen. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?. Don't have to like it, but you can't deny. You needed me to show you what comes next. I've set the standard far too high. For you to follow me. Feel free to try your best. You're all so fucking outrageous. I can't take it. Motherfuckers more than a little complacent. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?. Just sit the fuck down, pay attention. There's too much noise, for a second listen. Where did it go? where did it go so wrong?"
white line fever,"As I breathe, my disease brings me to my knees. All you need is a taste it'll set you free. Your infection's my discretion honey, one in the same. Counting second 'til I'm medicated, fucked in the brain. I don't want this baby. I just need it. I got the white line fever. And an appetite for sin. If there's a black hole headed for hell. Then baby count me in. I sold my soul so long ago. A bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go. If there's a black hole headed for hell. Then baby count me in. I sold my soul. Licking every drop of poison. Off a pocket of keys. While some daddy's little angels. Getting down on her knees. When the sun goes down. The filth roam free. You'll never find a finer specimen. Of filth in me. I don't want this. I just need this. To carry on. I got the white line fever. And an appetite for sin. If there's a black hole heading for hell. Then baby count me in. I sold my soul so long ago. A bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go. If there's a black hole heading for hell. Then baby count me in. Some have said that I'm the devil and it's just as well. Cause I've been through and burned down and rebuilt hell. With my heart in a vice. And a knife in my back. I've got a noose for the world, that I'm painting black. I got the white line fever. And an appetite for sin. If there's a black hole heading for hell. Then baby count me in. I sold my soul so long ago. The bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go. If there's a black hole heading for hell. Then baby count me in. I sold my soul"
wings for the sake of falling,"Kiss goodbye, to the poetic letters, the symptoms. Of being able to breathe without a care. Cushion the screaming, it's merely conversation in. regards to.

The sarcastic self will save me. Where'd it go, where'd it to go, where'd it go, where'd it go? okay!. The voice we need to talk, to talk, where'd it go, where'd it go?. Let the break house burn..
