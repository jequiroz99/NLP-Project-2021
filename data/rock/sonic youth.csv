L: I'm wondering if you're still interested in recording Sonic. Youth, or like doing some work with us there.. W: Uh-huh. L: At your place, what..um.. basically whats going on right now. is, um.. we're sort of biding our time waiting for Neutral to get. together to uh, you know, do our album and all this stuff... W: Right. L: And we decided we would like to try and release a quickie. single, like as quick as possible, just like 2 or 3 songs.. and um,. just do it as inexpensively as possible, and we were thinking. about doing it in four-track or something like that.. W: Right. L: And you know I talked to you about these incredible. four-track recordings that you were making and so, um, I was. wondering if you were actually still interested in working with us. on it and doing it at your place.. and you know, if the whole. thing goes well, we could probably give you some cash and stuff. if it comes out... W: Right. L: I mean, I'm not really sure what.. what the deal's gonna be,. we're probably gonna be trying to do it as... W: Right, inexpensive... L: ..you know, completely cheap, yeah, like I think you can get. a thousand singles for like around $400 or something like that... W: Right. L: and uh, so we're figuring out if we can afford to pay for a. sleeve or just have 'em white or what.... W: Fold em yourself (chuckles). L: What? Yeah, well that's.. don't laugh! That's exactly what... W: Well i did it!. L: You did? The Glorious Strangers one?. W: Right, the cover cost me $28... L: For how many?. W: (chuckles) I still have boxes of them... L: No, but I mean how many did $28 buy, a thousand?. W: Yeah. L: It did!?. W: At least... L: Incredible!. W: But I had to fold it all myself. L: Yeah but thats okay! Because the place where they sell you. the singles wants $200 for like a black and white photo sleeve... and that's a lot of money!. W: Yeah (chuckles). L: You know, I mean if we're trying to do it inexpensively... W: Right, this is the great inexpensive way.. L: Yeah. W: And you know, you can off-set.. you could put..do anything. on the cover you want, basically. L: Right, right. W: I just got it... L: Did you cut them to that proper shape and everything, with. the little flaps and all that?. W: Well I had it figured out... L: Uh-huh. W: You know when I centered the thing, that there would be. flaps on each side and I just figured out how to do it.. and I had. it down to like a four-thing procedure.... L: Uh-huh. W: ...and I got these gluesticks.... L: Yeah, they're great! They're really great... W: And you just go [makes gluestick noise], you know, and. now, admittedly, you know, if they don't get sold, they fall apart. in the store (chuckles). L: Oh god.. well we're gonna put them inside little plastic bags. also I think.. so they don't fall apart... W: Well you'll find that the plastic bags are expensive.. L: Well Thurston said, like $25.. no wait, 25 for a dollar... so that. would be like $40 for a thousand, that's not too expensive... W: That's not too bad... L: No I thought it was gonna be even more than that.. maybe. you could even get them cheaper if you tried to buy a thousand,. maybe you could get em for $30 or something like that... but I. was really worried about the [tape cuts off]"

eric's trip,"hatred. I hate the past. I can't see anything at all, all I see is me. that's clear enough. and that's whats important, to see me. my eyes can focus. my brain is talking. looks pretty good to me. my head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful. looks pretty good to me. sometimes I speak. tonight there's nothing to say. sometimes we freak. and laugh all day. hold these pages up to the light. see the jacknife inside of the dream. a railroad runs through the record stores at night. coming in for the deep freeze. Mary: a simple word, are you there in the country?. Yr eyes so full, yr head so tight. can't you hear me?. Remember our talk. that day on the phone?. I was the door, and you were the station. with shattered glass and miles between us. we still flew away in the conversation. my cup is full, and I feel okay. the world is dull, but not today. she think's she's a goddess. she says she talks to the spirits. I wonder if she can talk to herself?. If she can bear to hear it?. this is Eric's trip. we've all come to watch him slip. he's slipping all the way to Texas. can you dig it?. (Eric says ""The sky is blue...""). I see with a glass eye. the pavement view. a shadow forming, across the fields rushing. thru me to you. we tore down the world, and put up four walls. I breathe in the myth. I'm over the city, fucking the future. I'm high and inside yr kiss. we can't see clear. but what we see is a alright. we make up what we can't hear. and then we sing all night. scattered pages and shattered lights. a jacknife and a dream. there's something moving over there on the right. like nothing I've never seen."

eyeliner,"Eyeliner was so cheap. It was free it was easy to steal because no. Sister would miss it really. Why would anyone steal it anyway. You can apply it with the same expertise. As you have with yr guitar. Just a bit so no one. Gets too in yr face. Hit the street and go look for Angela. Licking Angela's thighs back and round and round. Black lined lashes is punk rock sex. Without all the hangups. Hits are for squares. And so is money. Burnt english muffin crunches nicely between teeth. With still a whole lotta future to go. Bags of records as currency. For rent and cigs and electricity. Shit and phone, prostitutes. On Chrystie and Delancey. Think I can afford sex. In Sara Delano Roosevelt Park?. Maybe I look like a rich kid. Or at least some kid with a bit of coin. They will take it. I can't even imagine it. Nowhere to go but the back door. Hard boot kick to metal void. Cold beer stench. Speed plowed waitress. Some art rock types working our way. To ice cream and thin sheet glory. A smile on the jesus freak. Hooked on our show. Burnished hearts blind to. Inevitable madness. Take care of the devil. Treat him with embrace. Alive with Mary Magdalene's heart. Her eyes light the screen, a siren. Breasts somewhat buttoned. Somewhat busting thru. Next town over and I land into. Exasperated non-finish. Deliver me into tour mode. Fucking kids crashing thru the woods. Stream language, resilient nature. Ripping thru: stones, rocks. Fallen branch. The chattering skulls of adult nayspeak (grimace). Dead orange alerts annoy the bedroom gate. The poems, like text-straps, soothe and protect. And beautify the insect click. City noise, screeching car-things. Grandmothers in fractured finery. A perfect day to taste a dog's coat. Puppy lust, n' luck. Corrective licking strategies. She motions for a light curious. To the invasive fix. Eyeliner. Eyeliner. Eyeliner. Eyeliner. Eyeliner. Eyeliner. Eyeliner. Eyeliner"

We had just left shore when everything began to happen at once. the water came in and we started to go down. i looked at jill and she looked back, thinking it would be alright to go down. then the railings broke and the motors gave out. the hall emptied out and no-one was left for the band. the amps all wet, speakers burst, soaked. we, up three flight now, tried to meet up with the galley crew. but it seemed everyone had gone. we had a smoke to pass some time. jill said ``I'd love to, right now"". what could i say, we did while the waters rose, licking our feet. it was fun and funny so we laughed. I loved the way she could laugh, so full bodied. when we hit the sky we were high over the rooves. a field of gnarled antennas coiling upwards. waves and waveforms joining in a nice hot blast. so different from the boat. the cold silver sky opened for us and we passed through. last i saw of jill she was heading into the coils of the antennae. laughing, so beautiful. saying she hadn't yet had her fill of the boys there and the electricity. saying she wanted to plug in again and fry a bit. i said ``watch the water love"". she kept laughing and shook her hair. she said ``I'd love to, right now, you know"". so we did, and had a smoke too, and her lips parted. there in amongst the coiling snakes of an antenna she looked right at home. the waves came up and a blinding flash caught me dreaming of her. as she looked all crossed with wires and sparks watching the blast. everything went orange and all my thoughts dissolved inwards in the cloud. i thought one last: how different from the sea is the boat"

Comin' in from dreamland I'm on fire. I can see it's all been here before. Dream a dream that lies right at your door. When the seasons circle sideways out of turn. And words don't speak just fall across the carpet. You're just in time to watch the fire burn. It seems a crime but your face is bright you love it. All the time..."

nyc ghosts & flowers,"When the phone rang, 3 in the morn, dead middle of night. There was nuthin on the line. I set back the silent receiver / tiny flames lit in my head. Hey did any of you freaks here ever remember lenny?. I can't remember his last name. He's turned to dust now, one of the chosen few. Left out in the rain, out of town again. Left out in the rain, ocean bound i guess. Between the matress and a column of hazy faces. I remember every word you said. Quite a clear picture ev'ry word you said. The door was open but the way was not lit. And there was no way out of my head. On a crimson hiway by a chrome bumper i last saw you:. Alive / inclined to thrive / evening fireflies lit sparks around yr head. But wait a minute let's back up a bit:. Some famous stars were busted by the thought police down on fashion avenue. Impersonating real men / not knowing who they really were. Now here at dark corners all is calm and quiet and good. The kids are up late dreaming quiet questions in a graceful mood:. Can you please pass me a jug of winter light?. Fold me in an ocean's whim?. In sweet corrosive fire light?. In the city made of tin?. Are you famous under the skin?. Familiar with the things you wanted?. Able now to take it all in?. Making peace w/ every hole in the story?. Did lightning keep you up all night?. Illuminate the soot and grit?. Can you tell how high the sky tonight?. Dig out from under in spite of it?. Can you cover up the one that floats?. Can you push back the hours?. I hear yr voice, I speak yr name. Among nyc ghosts and flowers. Will we meet? to run again?. Thru nyc ghosts and flowers"

rain king,"Rain King ensures there's nowhere to go. It's jet stream, daydream, cocksure hard luck show. His lips a fountain. His daylight sparks. He's a shotgun, schoolyard, street-wise, white-hot kid. Little whipcream, phone call, breakdown, Rain King fist. His mind a countdown. His daydream sparks. I need three years to clear these thoughts, hey. I like to say I knew one true thing. It feels like years and all I've done is fought. And not turned up, anything. Little black, take roll and roll, over my bed. I'm waiting here for, some reality crease. There's one big deadend, in my head. And not a moment of peace. Crossfire, Rain King, with his cadillac, kid. Marries every dictionary from his chain-yard bliss. His lips a fountain. His daylight sparks. He's got a shot in his kick forging the real, when. He's a steel drum, wedding ring, Pontiac door knob ten. His mind a countdown. His daylight sparks. Hung up on a speed king nation, caught up on a nail. Hanging tight with time, at least, a little while. Your sister is a beauty when she's naked, like my kid. I hear this world, cool world, dreaming of a peaceful kis."

I'm from Sherman Oaks - just a wheel with spokes. but I ain't giving you headace - in a Sunset bungalow. Roshumba, Judith, Paulina, Cathy, Vendella, Naomi,.

sympathy for the strawberry,LET ME INTRODUCE YOU. SINCE YOU SAW MY SHADOW SELF. LIVING UNDERNEATH YOU. SHE CAN'T RESIST A TICKLE OUT. I'M A GIRL SCOUT. SEARCHING FOR THE NEW STUFF. DID I MENTION THAT IT MELTS AWAY(ALLGONE). SHE PUTS A SIGN OUT. OUT OF ORDER (A WANT A BUILDING THAT SAYS). MAKES YOU STRONGLY DISOBEY. GUIDING YOU AWAY. CHIDING YOU AWAY. SO QUICK TO HIDE WHEN I TURN AROUND. SHE WILL RISE JUST TO EMBARRASS ME. SHE LIKES TO DANCE WHEN IT'S DARK INSIDE. JUST A FLASHLIGHT THERE. FOR A GUIDE. TRY AND CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. FREE AND WILD. WATCH WHERE YOU STAND. BELOW THE NET. DESIRE IT GROWS AND GROWS. LIKE A STRAWBERRY NOT A ROSE. PRICKLY PATCH DON'T YOU STAND ON ME. SQUISHING DOWN. IN THE MUD AHH!. -----------. lyrics: Kim Gordon.

teenage riot,"You're it. No, you're it. Hey, you're really it. You're it. No I mean it, you're it. Say it. Don't spray it. Spirit desire (face me). Spirit desire (don't displace me). Spirit desire. We will fall. Miss me. Don't dismiss me. Spirit desire. Spirit desire [x3]. We will fall. Spirit desire. We will fall. Spirit desire [x3]. We will fall. Spirit desire. We will fall. [Thurston]. Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather. And what's a man do. To but work out whether it's true?. Looking for a man with a focus and a temper. Who can open up a map and see between one and two. Time to get it. Before you let it. Get to you. Here he comes now. Stick to your guns. And let him through. Everybody's coming from the winter vacation. Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you. You come running in on platform shoes. With Marshall stacks. To at least just give us a clue. Ah, here it comes. I know it's someone I knew. Teenage riot in a public station. Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you. Now I see it. I think I'll leave it out of the way. Now I come near you. And it's not clear why you fade away. Looking for a ride to your secret location. Where the kids are setting up. A free-speed nation, for you. Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer. That's rockin'. And a cord and a pedal and a lock,. That'll do me for now. It better work out. I hope it works out my way. 'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head. Takes a teen age riot. To get me out of bed right now. You better look it. We're gonna shake it. Up to him. He acts the hero. We paint a zero. On his hand. We know it's down. We know it's bound too loose. Everybody's sound is round it. Everybody wants to be proud to choose. So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather. You're never gonna stop. All the teenage leather and booze. It's time to go round. A one man showdown. Teach us how to fail. We're off the streets now. And back on the road. On the riot trail"

unmade bed,"Look who's come back home again. Loser looking for his lucky break. This time he says he just needs a friend. Ain't on the run he ain't on the take. Can you unlock this door babe. Will you just undo the chain. Will you take yr time before you. Mix up love, his love and pain. Loneliness lays down his head. Wants to get you high, better take it now. A man like that's like an unmade bed. Stained eyes searching for another way out. Do you really even want this. Maybe you just don't care. All I know it takes just one kiss, babe. For you - he's never there. Hey I know it's kinda hard. And maybe this time it will never end. Hit and run lover back in yr heart. All those answered prayers that you never have sent. Cuz now that yr in his arms babe. You know yr just in his way. Suckered by his fatal charm, oh girl. It's time we get away"
unwind,"[Thurston]. lay down your lucky hand, upon her heart. morning becomes a kite, tangled up in stars. laugh in the midday light, and leave - it behind. move out into his sundry eyes, and sing, unwind. hang down your lucky head, a sign to time. morning becomes the sun, for the dandy line. sooner than the midday light, we leave behind. love is out into the sundry light, you sing, unwind."
victoria,"Long ago life was clean. Sex was bad and obscene. And the rich were so mean. Stately homes for the Lords. Croquet lawns, village greens. Victoria was my queen.

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria. Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria.. Land of hope and gloria. Land of my Victoria. Land of hope and gloria. Land of my Victoria.. Victoria, 'toria. Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria.. Canada to India. Australia to Cornwall. Singapore to Hong Kong. From the West to the East. From to the rich to the poor. Victoria loved them all.. Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria. Victoria, Victoria, Victoria.. SU NIOJ!. FLEX YOUR HEAD!"
waist,"[Thurston]. guess who came round today. X-Girl and the girl snoo-pee. twinkle toes and sparkle eyes. everything is a new surprise. they're gonna spend some super-cash. spend it all on the boy-smash. and all the glamour is all the time. silver jacket and a twist of lime. well hope you don't waste away. yeah hope you don't waste away. you better not waste away. ooh yeah don't waste away. I've seen it happen before. girl slipping out the door. sneaking into Agnes B.. throw away everything. you've been a waste away. you've been a waste away. you've been a waste away, now. walk up to her and say. I'd love you anyway. sweet subtle super style. wonder how to make an angel smile. don't let me waste away. don't let me waste away. don't let me waste away. don't let me waste away, wow."
walkin' blue,"Hey now, what's the news I heard?. You been seen walkin' blue. I know we're all confused, it's true. I know you feel the same way. Everything we see is clear. Everything we feel. I'm here to let you know all we need to do. Is just to just let go. You've heard we're born to lose, I know. But don't start to think that's really true. You've got the walking blues today. But soon we'll stand and let the music play. Everything we dream is clear. Everything we need. Let's say, you and I we find. Something hard to hold, let's keep it in our mind. And let it fill our days. Then we slip and finally let it stray. Now we're in for the long ride. We can let the rest slip aside. Everything we see is clear. Everything we feel is clear. Everything we dream is clear. Everything we see is clear"
washing machine,"[Kim]. yeah, I take my baby down to the street and I buy him a soda-pop. he's so sweet. alright now, alright now, alright now. you said that. if you want I'll be the one. take you out and have some fun.

I buy him a soda-pop. hmm hmm. alright now, alright now, alright now. if you want I'll be the one. take you out and have some fun. flip a quarter for the toss. I'd like mine with apple-sauce. yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and. I buy him a soda-pop. `cause he's so neat, sweet. alright now, alright now, alright now. okay now. if you want I'll be the one. shake my legs and have some fun. my hearts spinnin' round like a washing machine. never saw the devil look so damn clean. yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and. I buy him a soda-pop. and he said: ""honey, you look so fine"". and I said: okay, alright, okay, alright. I was walking up Lafayette street. it's real empty. and I looked out and it turned into a big field. and I looked up in the sky. and I looked up in the clouds. and I saw this face looking down at me. and it's a women's face. and she threw a quarter down at me and she said:. ""honey, here's a quarter go put it in the washing machine"". and then I looked up at her,. I looked up. ."
what a waste,Hey gimme hollow stimulation. Its so sleazy to be free. Lets invest in dull creation. Thrill city cheap legacy. What a waste. Yr so chaste. I can't wait. To taste yr face. vapid signals lead me to you. a sublime spectacular dud. safe and sound from chatter confusion. get the picture yes it's clear as mud. lyrics: thurston moore/kim gordon 2006. Letra incluida por Bea D*
what we know,"I'm in a state of shock. I'm creeping up and down your block. I'm looking into you. I'm trying to catch your view. It's not a quiet meditation. Oh, that we know. Darkness makes the night more cold. That's what we know about me. Satisfied wise child. Creeping heart and frozen perfection. You can touch my hand. I drink a case of you. Heaven's not about your reputation. Yeah that we know. Forever means the night turns gold. That's what we know about you. It's been quite a ride. With you my sweet, here by my side. Funny how the mountains slide. We're stepping across the great divide. Our bodies vibrate slowly. anekatips.com. Yeah, that we know. Bound to give it heart and soul. That's what we know about us"

winner's blues,"1. Winner's Blues. [Thurston]. by the way, go out not today. move back along and wait a long long time. nothing running free, you gotta time it all. run out the door come back when you score. new times will come and you will see a door. into the lion eye and now I'm gone. and it's out. and it's not what you thought it was about. but a life, that you know. will keep you bound in. sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. sometimes you got still the blues for me. I could run away, a long time to stay. burn out your eyes, burn out surprise. look out today you know it's not the same. it's all the rage, it's every day. and it's out. and it's not what you thought it was about. but a life, that you know. will keep you round in love."
wish fulfillment,"[Lee]. I see your wishes on the wall, and that's all right with me. I see you run to make a call, hoping that there's someone free. your life and my life they don't touch at all, and that's no way to be. we've never seemed so far. what's real? what is true?. I ain't turning my back on you. where're you goin'? where've you been?. making wishes, watching dreams. it might be simple, it might be true, I might be overwhelmed by you. you might be empty, the way your eyes just look right through. it's such a mess now anyway, wish fulfillment every day. I don't believe you, now I can't hear a word you say. I see you shaking in the light, reading the headline news. the others they're not quite so bright, we want them to choose you. I could almost see your face tonight, singing simple rhythm'n'blues. you'll always be a star. shake it baby! come'on scream!. just see your face in a magazine. don't doubt it! leaves Chris sore! (?). I can't stand it anymore. it's my favorite shot of you, you look so pretty your eyes were true. I'm still on your side, in spite of everything you do. we're only blood on blood on life, you paint me pictures every night (?). come wish beside me, don't you know you know what's right. ."
within you without me,"We were talking about the space between us all. And the people who hide themselves behind a wall. Of illusion. Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late. When they pass away. We were talking about the love we all could share. When we find it. To try our best to hold it there. With our love. With our love, we could save the world. If they only knew. Try to realize it's all within yourself. No one else can make you change. And to see you're really only very small. And life goes on within you and without you. We were talking about the love that's gone so cold. And the people who gain the world and lose their soul. They don't know - they can't see. Are you one of them?. When you've seen beyond yourself. Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there. And the time will come when you see we're all one. And life goes on within you and without you"
