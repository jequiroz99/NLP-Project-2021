wish you were here,"So, so you think you can tell. Heaven from Hell. Blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field. From a cold steel rail?. A smile from a veil?. Do you think you can tell?. Did they get you to trade. Your heroes for ghosts?. Hot ashes for trees?. Hot air for a cool breeze?. Cold comfort for change?. Did you exchange. A walk on part in the war. For a lead role in a cage?. How I wish. How I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls. Swimming in a fish bowl. Year after year. Running over the same old ground. What have we found?. The same old fears. Wish you were here"
comfortably numb,"Hello. Is there anybody in there?. Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home?. Come on now. I hear you're feeling down. I can ease your pain. And get you on your feet again. Relax. I need some information first. Just the basic facts. Can you show me where it hurts. There is no pain, you are receding. A distant ship smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move. but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I had a fever. My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've got that feeling once again. I can't explain, you would not understand. This is not how I am. I have become comfortably numb. I have become comfortably numb. Ok. Just a little pin prick. There'll be no more. But you may feel a little sick. Can you stand up?. I do believe it's working, good. That'll keep you going, through the show. Come on it's time to go. There is no pain you are receding. A distant ship smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move. but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child. I caught a fleeting glimpse. Out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look but it was gone. I cannot put my finger on it now. The child is grown. The dream is gone. And I have become comfortably numb"
time,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day. You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town. Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.. Tired of lying in the sunshine. Staying home to watch the rain.. You are young and life is long. And there is time to kill today.. And then one day you find. Ten years have got behind you.. No one told you when to run,. You missed the starting gun.. And you run and you run to catch up with the sun. But it's sinking. And racing around to come up behind you again.. The sun is the same in a relative way. But you're older,. Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.. Every year is getting shorter. Never seem to find the time.. Plans that either come to naught. Or half a page of scribbled lines. Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way. The time has gone, the song is over,. Thought I'd something more to say.. Home, home again. I like to be here when I can. When I come home cold and tired. It's good to warm my bones beside the fire. Far away, across the field. The tolling of the iron bell. Calls the faithful to their knees. To hear the softly spoken magic spells"
hey you,"Hey you. Out there in the cold. Getting lonely, getting old. Can you feel me?. Hey you. Standing in the aisle. With itchy feet and fading smile. Can you feel me?. Hey you. Don't help them to bury the light. Don't give in, without a fight. Hey you. Out there on your own. Sitting naked by the phone. Would you touch me?. Hey you. With your ear against the wall. Waiting for someone to call out. Would you touch me?. Hey you. Would you help me to carry the stone?. Open your heart, I'm coming home. But it was only, fantasy. The wall was too high, as you can see. No matter how hard he tried. he could not break free. And the worms ate into his brain. Hey you. Out there on the road. Always doing what you're told. Can you help me?. Hey you. Out there beyond the wall. Breaking bottles in the hall. Can you help me?. Hey you. Don't tell me there's no hope at all. Together we stand, divided we fall"
shine on you crazy diamond,"Remember when you were young?. You shone like the sun.. Shine on, you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes. Like black holes in the sky. Shine on, you crazy diamond. You were caught in the crossfire. Of childhood and stardom,. Blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target. For faraway laughter;. Come on you stranger, you legend,. You martyr, and shine. You reached for the secret. Too soon. You cried for the moon. Shine on, you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night. And exposed in the light. Shine on, you crazy diamond. Well, you wore out your welcome. With random precision. Rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions;. Come on you painter, you piper,. You prisoner, and shine. Nobody knows where you are,. How near or how far. Shine on, you crazy diamond. Pile on many. More layers. And i'll be joining you there. Shine on, you crazy diamond. And we'll bask in the shadow. Of yesterday's triumph. And sail on the steel breeze. Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,. Come on you miner for truth and delusion,. And shine."
money,"Money, get away.. Get a good job with more pay and you're okay.. Money, it's a gas.. Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.. New car, caviar, four star daydream,. Think I'll buy me a football team.. Money, get back.. I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.. Money, it's a hit.. Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.. I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set. And I think I need a Lear jet.. Money, it's a crime.. Share it fairly. but don't take a slice of my pie.. Money, so they say. Is the root of all evil today.. But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're. giving none away.. ""HuHuh! I was in the right!"". ""Yes, absolutely in the right!"".

learning to fly,"Into the distance a ribbon of black. Stretched to the point of no turning back. A flight of fancy on a windswept field. Standing alone my senses real. A fatal attraction holding me fast how. Can I escape this irresistible grasp?. Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies. Tongue-tied and twisted. Just an earth-bound misfit, I. Ice is forming on the tips of my wings. Unheeded warnings. I thought I thought of everything. No navigator to find my way home. Unladened, empty and turned to stone. A soul in tension that's learning to fly. Condition grounded but determined to try. Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies. Tongue-tied and twisted. Just an earth-bound misfit, I. Above the planet on a wing and a prayer. My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air. Across the clouds I see my shadow fly. Out of the corner of my watering eye. A dream unthreatened by the morning light. Could blow this soul. Right through the roof of the night. There's no sensation to compare with this. Suspended animation, a state of bliss. Can't keep my mind from the circling skies. Tongue-tied and twisted. Just an earth-bound misfit, I"

coming back to life,Where were you when I was burned and broken. While the days slipped by from my window watching. Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless. Because the things you say. and the things you do surround me. While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words. Dying to believe in what you heard. I was staring straight into the shining sun. Lost in thought and lost in time. While the seeds of life and the seeds of change. were planted. Outside the rain fell dark and slow. While I pondered on this dangerous. but irresistible pastime. I took a heavenly ride through our silence. I knew the moment had arrived. For killing the past and coming back to life. I took a heavenly ride through our silence. I knew the waiting had begun. And headed straight... into the shining sun

And if there is no room upon the hill. And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too. I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.. The lunatic is in my head.. The lunatic is in my head. You raise the blade, you make the change. You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.. You lock the door. And throw away the key. There's someone in my head but it's not me.. And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear. You shout and no one seems to hear.. And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes. I'll see you on the dark side of the moon..

echoes,Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air. And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves. The echo of a distant tide. Comes willowing across the sand. And everything is green and submarine. And no one calls us to the land. And no one knows the wheres or whys. But something stirs and. Something tries. And starts to climb towards the light. Strangers passing in the street. By chance two separate glances meet. And I am you and what I see is me. And do I take you by the hand. And lead you through the land. And help me understand the best I can. And no one calls us to move on. And no one forces down our eyes. And no one speaks. And no one tries. And no one flies around the sun. Cloudless every day you fall. Upon my waking eyes. Inviting and inciting me to rise. And through the window in the wall. Comes streaming in on sunlight wings. A million bright ambassadors of morning. And no one sings me lullabies. And no one makes me close my eyes. So I throw the windows wide. And call to you across the sky
high hopes,Beyond the horizon of the place we lived. when we were young. In a world of magnets and miracles. Our thoughts strayed constantly. and without boundary. The ringing of the division bell had began. Along the long road and on down the causeway. Do they still meet there by the cut. There was a ragged band. that followed in our footsteps. Running before time took our dreams away. Leaving the myriad small creatures. trying to tie us to the ground. To a life consumed by slow decay. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. With friends surrounded. The nights of wonder. Looking beyond the embers of bridges. glowing behind us. To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side. Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again. Dragged by the force of some inner tide. At a higher altitude with flag unfurled. We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world. Encumbered forever by desire and ambition. There's a hunger still unsatisfied. Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon. Though down this road we've been so many times. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. The taste was sweeter. The nights of wonder. With friends surrounded. The dawn mist glowing. The water flowing. The endless river. Forever and ever
dogs,"You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need. You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street. You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed. And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight. You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.. And after a while, you can work on points for style. Like the club tie, and the firm handshake. A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile. You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to. So that when they turn their backs on you. You'll get the chance to put the knife in.. You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder. You know it's going to get harder, and harder,. and harder as you get older. And in the end you'll pack, fly down south. Hide your head in the sand. Just another sad old man. All alone and dying of cancer.. And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest that you've sown. And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around. So have a good drown, as you go down alone. Dragged down by the stone.. I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused. Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used. Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake of this creeping malaise. If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?. Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending. That everyone's expendable and no-one had a real friend. And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner. Everything's done under the sun. And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.. Who was born in a house full of pain. Who was trained not to spit in the fan. Who was told what to do by the man. Who was broken by trained personnel. Who was fitted with collar and chain. Who was given a pat on the back. Who was breaking away from the pack. Who was only a stranger at home. Who was ground down in the end. Who was found dead on the phone. Who was dragged down by the stone"

a great day for freedom,"On the day the wall came down. They threw the locks onto the ground. And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived. On the day the wall came down. The Ship of Fools had finally run aground. Promises lit up the night. Like paper doves in flight. I dreamed you had left my side. No warmth, not even pride remained. And even though you needed me. It was clear that I could not do a thing for you. Now life devalues day by day. As friends and neighbours turn away. And there's a change that, even with regret,. Cannot be undone. Now frontiers shift like desert sands. While nations wash their bloodied hands. Of loyalty, of history, in shades of gray. I woke to the sound of drums. The music played,. The morning sun streamed in. I turned and I looked at you. And all but the bitted residue slipped away.... Slipped away"

country song,"He made his way to the border. In the shadow under the trees. Down by a stream in a hollow. Turn your head feel the breeze. And the red Queen was waiting for the news. For the white King to move. And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried. To stay within the shadows. And keep his undercover secret tight. They let him in by a backway. Into a chamber reserved for the Queen. She took the note that he gave her. Opened it slowly and started to read. Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold. Give it to the pawn who came, she cried. He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong. And all the courtiers crowded her. and this is what she told the gathered round. Go to the store by the dungeon. Take all the red paint take all the white. Make up a newborn colour. Cover your neighbor we'll be all right. There will be no game today, she cried across the board. Everyday will be a holiday. And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad. And the Pink Queen sat. and smiled at the cat who smiled back."
crumbling land,"In a while I'll find the time to make the sunshine mine. in a smile I saw a single eagle in the sky. wheeling, soaring, gliding high. On a hill there lived a man with many shining things. shiny gold, shiny car and shiny diamond rings. wining, dining, shining king. Now the eagle flies in clear blue skies. drinking in the clear blue well. back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies. but fifty more come rolling off the floor production line. Then a man commuting like a village on the sand. in his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land. screaming, dealing, movie man. Here we go, hold your breath to see if something blows. close your eyes, count till ten and see the sunrise rise. gliding high into the sky. By the holy mansion, let the guardian rise. upon the finger of the king. on high the eagle flies, that glitter all of gold. then wheeling in a cloudy sky, he flies into the sun."

dogs,"You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need. You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street. You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed. And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight. You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.. And after a while, you can work on points for style. Like the club tie, and the firm handshake. A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile. You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to. So that when they turn their backs on you. You'll get the chance to put the knife in.. You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder. You know it's going to get harder, and harder,. and harder as you get older. And in the end you'll pack, fly down south. Hide your head in the sand. Just another sad old man. All alone and dying of cancer.. And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest that you've sown. And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around. So have a good drown, as you go down alone. Dragged down by the stone.. I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused. Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used. Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake of this creeping malaise. If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?. Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending. That everyone's expendable and no-one had a real friend. And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner. Everything's done under the sun. And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.. Who was born in a house full of pain. Who was trained not to spit in the fan. Who was told what to do by the man. Who was broken by trained personnel. Who was fitted with collar and chain. Who was given a pat on the back. Who was breaking away from the pack. Who was only a stranger at home. Who was ground down in the end. Who was found dead on the phone. Who was dragged down by the stone"

echoes,Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air. And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves. The echo of a distant tide. Comes willowing across the sand. And everything is green and submarine. And no one calls us to the land. And no one knows the wheres or whys. But something stirs and. Something tries. And starts to climb towards the light. Strangers passing in the street. By chance two separate glances meet. And I am you and what I see is me. And do I take you by the hand. And lead you through the land. And help me understand the best I can. And no one calls us to move on. And no one forces down our eyes. And no one speaks. And no one tries. And no one flies around the sun. Cloudless every day you fall. Upon my waking eyes. Inviting and inciting me to rise. And through the window in the wall. Comes streaming in on sunlight wings. A million bright ambassadors of morning. And no one sings me lullabies. And no one makes me close my eyes. So I throw the windows wide. And call to you across the sky

high hopes,Beyond the horizon of the place we lived. when we were young. In a world of magnets and miracles. Our thoughts strayed constantly. and without boundary. The ringing of the division bell had began. Along the long road and on down the causeway. Do they still meet there by the cut. There was a ragged band. that followed in our footsteps. Running before time took our dreams away. Leaving the myriad small creatures. trying to tie us to the ground. To a life consumed by slow decay. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. With friends surrounded. The nights of wonder. Looking beyond the embers of bridges. glowing behind us. To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side. Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again. Dragged by the force of some inner tide. At a higher altitude with flag unfurled. We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world. Encumbered forever by desire and ambition. There's a hunger still unsatisfied. Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon. Though down this road we've been so many times. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. The taste was sweeter. The nights of wonder. With friends surrounded. The dawn mist glowing. The water flowing. The endless river. Forever and ever

learning to fly,"Into the distance a ribbon of black. Stretched to the point of no turning back. A flight of fancy on a windswept field. Standing alone my senses real. A fatal attraction holding me fast how. Can I escape this irresistible grasp?. Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies. Tongue-tied and twisted. Just an earth-bound misfit, I. Ice is forming on the tips of my wings. Unheeded warnings. I thought I thought of everything. No navigator to find my way home. Unladened, empty and turned to stone. A soul in tension that's learning to fly. Condition grounded but determined to try. Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies. Tongue-tied and twisted. Just an earth-bound misfit, I. Above the planet on a wing and a prayer. My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air. Across the clouds I see my shadow fly. Out of the corner of my watering eye. A dream unthreatened by the morning light. Could blow this soul. Right through the roof of the night. There's no sensation to compare with this. Suspended animation, a state of bliss. Can't keep my mind from the circling skies. Tongue-tied and twisted. Just an earth-bound misfit, I"

lost for words,I was spending my time in the doldrums. I was caught in a cauldron of hate. I felt persecuted and paralysed. I thought that everything else would just wait. While you are wasting your time on your enemies. Engulfed in a fever of spite. Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades. Like shadows into the night. To martyr yourself to caution. Is not going to help at all. because ther'll be no safety in numbers. When the right one walks out of the door. Can you see your days blighted by darkness?. Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?. Stuck in a world of isolation. While the ivy grows over the door. So I open my door to my enemies. And I ask could we wipe the slate clean. But they tell me to please go fuck myself. You know you just can't win

matilda mother,"There was a king who ruled the land.. His majesty was in command.. With silver eyes the scarlet eagle. Showers silver on the people.. Oh Mother, tell me more.. Why'd'ya have to leave me there. Hanging in my infant air. Waiting?. You only have to read the lines. They're scribbly black and everything shines.. Across the stream with wooden shoes. With bells to tell the king the news. A thousand misty riders climb up. Higher once upon a time.. Wandering and dreaming. The words have different meaning.. Yes they did.. For all the time spent in that room. The doll's house, darkness, old perfume. And fairy stories held me high on. Clouds of sunlight floating by.. Oh Mother, tell me more. Tell me more.. Aaaaaaaah. Aaaaaaaah. Aaaaaaaah"

on the turning away,"On the turning away. From the pale and downtrodden. And the words they say. Which we won't understand. ""Don't accept that what's happening. Is just a case of others' suffering. Or you'll find that you're joining in. The turning away"". It's a sin that somehow. Light is changing to shadow. And casting it's shroud. Over all we have known. Unaware how the ranks have grown. Driven on by a heart of stone. We could find that we're all alone. In the dream of the proud. On the wings of the night. As the daytime is stirring. Where the speechless unite. In a silent accord. Using words you will find are strange. And mesmerised as they light the flame. Feel the new wind of change. On the wings of the night. No more turning away. From the weak and the weary. No more turning away. From the coldness inside. Just a world that we all must share. It's not enough just to stand and stare. Is it only a dream that there'll be. No more turning away?"

one slip,"A restless eye across a weary room. A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin. The music played and played as we whirled without end. No hint, no word her honour to defend. I will, I will she sighed to my request. And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test. Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire. I lead the way to the funeral pyre. And without a thought of the consequence. I gave in to my decadence. One slip, and down the hole we fall. It seems to take no time at all. A momentary lapse of reason. That binds a life for life. A small regret, you won't forget,. There'll be no sleep in here tonight. Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?. Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?. The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown. The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone. One slip, and down the hole we fall. It seems to take no time at all. A momentary lapse of reason. That binds a life for life. A small regret, you will never forget,. There'll be no sleep in here tonight"
outside the wall,"All alone, or in two's,. The ones who really love you. Walk up and down outside the wall.. Some hand in hand. And some gathered together in bands.. The bleeding hearts and artists.

paintbox,"Last night I had too much to drink. Sitting in a club with so many fools. Playing to rules. Trying to impress but feeling rather empty. I had another drink. Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink. What a way to spend that evening. They all turn up with their friends. Playing the game. But in the scene I should have been. Far away. Away - away - away - away - away. Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before. I open the door to an empty room. Then I forget. The telephone rings and someone speaks. She would very much like to go out to a show. So what can I do - I can't think what to say. She sees through anyway. Away - away - away - away - away. Out of the front door I go. Traffic's moving rather slow. Arriving late, there she waits. Looking very angry, as cross as she can be. Be - a - be - a - be - a - be - a - be. Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before. I open the door to an empty room. Then I forget."
paranoid eyes,"Button your lip. And don't let the shield slip.. Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask.. And if they try. To break down your disguise with their questions,. You can hide, hide, hide.. Behind paranoid eyes.. You put on your brave face. And slip over the road for a job.. Fixing your grin. As you casually lean on the bar.. Laughing too loud at the rest of the world. With the boys in the crowd.. You can hide, hide, hide. Behind petrified eyes.. You believed in their stories of fame,. Fortune and glory.. Now you're lost in a haze. Of alcohol soft middle age.. The pie in the sky. Turned out to be miles too high.. And you're hide, hide, hide. Behind brown and mild eyes."

point me at the sky,"Hey jean misses henry mclean. An' I finished my beautiful flying machine. An' I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving. An' maybe you'd like to fly with me and hide with me baby. Isn't it strange how little we change. Isn't it sad we're insane. Playing the game that we know ends in tears. The game we've been playing. For thousands and thousands and thousands. Jumps into his cosmic flyer. Pulls his plastic collar higher. Light the fuse and stand well back, he cried. This is my last goodbye. Point me at the sky and let it fly. And if you survive 'till two thousand and five. I hope you're exceedingly thin. For if you are stout you will have to breathe out. While the people around you. Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in. People pressing on my sides is something that I hate. And so is sitting down to eat. With only little capsules on my plate. Point me at the sky and let it fly. All we got to say to you is good bye"
poles apart,"Did you know...it was all going to go so wrong for you. And did you see it was all going to be so right for me. Why did we tell you then. You were always the golden boy then. And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes. Hey you...did you ever realise what you'd become. And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from. Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway. Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes. The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty. I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me. And did you know.... I never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes"
raving and drooling,Raving and drooling I fell on his neck with a scream. He had a whole lotta terminal shock in his eyes. That's what you get for pretending the rest are not real. Babbling and snapping at far away flies. He will zig zag his way back through memories of boredom and pain. How does it feel to be empty and angry and spaced. Split up the middle between the illusion of safety in numbers. and the fist in your face

Backward and homebound,. The pigeon, the dove,. Gone with the wind. And the rain, on an airplane.. Owning a home with no silver spoon,. I'm drinking champagne. Like a good tycoon.. Sooner than wait for. A break in the weather,. I'll gather my far-flung thoughts together.. Speeding away on the wind to a new day.. And if you're alone. I'll come home.. And I pause for a while. By a country style. And listen to the things they say.. Diggin' for gold. With a hoe in my hand.. Open a book. Take a look at the way things stand.. And you're leading me down. To the place by the sea.. I hear your soft voice. Calling to me.. Making a date for later by phone. And if you're alone. I'll come home."

Under the eaves where a swallow is resting. Set the controls for the heart of the sun. Over the mountain watching the watcher. Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine. Morning to birth is born into shadow. Love is the shadow that ripens the wine. Set the controls for the heart of the sun. The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun. Witness the man who raves at the wall. Making the shape of his questions to Heaven. Whether the sun will fall in the evening. Will he remember the lesson of giving. Set the controls for the heart of the sun. The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun"

sorrow,"The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land. Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:. A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers,. But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking. He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise. In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise. He's chained forever to a world that's departed. It's not enough, it's not enough. His blood has frozen & curdled with fright. His knees have trembled & given way in the night. His hand has weakened at the moment of truth. His step has faltered. One world, one soul. Time pass, the river rolls. It's not enough it's not enough. His hand has faltered. .... .... ....... And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication. And silent replies that swirl invitation. Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea. A grim intimation of what is to be. There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night. And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight. And silence that speaks so much louder than words,. Of promises broken"

And when the fight was over. We spent what they had made.. But in the bottom of our hearts. We felt the final cut."

I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all.. We met just six hours ago,. The music was too loud.. From your bed I gained a day. And lost a bloody year.. And I would like to know. How do you feel? (x3). Not a single word was said,. Delights still without fears. Occasionally you showed a smile. But what was the need?. I felt the cold far too soon - the wind of '95. My friends are lying in the sun,. I wish that I was there.. Tomorrow brings another town. And another girl like you.. Have your time before you leave. To greet another man. Just you let me know. How do you feel? (x3). Good-bye to you.... Charlotte Kringles too.. I've had enough for one day."
swan lee (silas lang),"Swan Lee got up at the Running Foot pow-wow,. heading from the fire to his waiting canoe.. Chattering Squaw untied the wigwam door,. the chief blew smoke rings two by two!.

take it back,"Her love rains down on me as easy as the breeze. I listen to the breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea. I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire. We were spinning into darkness; & the earth was on fire. She could take it back, she might take it back some day. So I spy on her, I have lied to her,. I make promises I cannot keep. Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep. And I make her prove her love for me,. I take all that I can take. And I push her to the limit to see if she will break. She might take it back, she could take it back some day. Now I had seen the warnings, screaming from all sides. It's easy to ignore them God knows I've tried. All of this temptation,. you know it turned my faith to lies. Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide. She Could take it back, she will take it back some day. She Could take it back, she will take it back some day. She will take it back; She will take it back some day"
take up the stethoscope and walk,Doctor doctor!. I'm in bed. Achin' head. Gold is lead. Choke on bread. Underfed. Gold is lead. Jesus bled. Pain is red. Are goon. Grow go. Greasy spoon. You swoon.

the dark side of the moon (álbum completo),"Breathe. Breathe, breathe in the air.. Don't be afraid to care.. Leave but don't leave me.. Look around and choose your own ground..

the division bell (complete),"Cluster One. What Do You Want From Me. As you look around this room tonight. Settle in your seat and dim the lights. Do you want my blood, do you want my tears. What do you want. What do you want from me. Should I sing until I can't sing any more. Play these strings till my fingers are raw. You're so hard to please. What do you want from me. Do you think that I know something you don't know. What do you want from me. If I don't promise you the answers would you go. What do you want from me. Should I stand out in the rain. Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you. I'm not the one you need. What do you want from me. You can have anything you want. You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water. Anything you want. You can own everything you see. Sell your soul for complete control. Is that really what you need. You can lose yourself this night. See inside there is nothing to hide. Turn and face the light. What do you want from me. Poles Apart. Did you know... it was all going to go so wrong for you. And did you see it was all going to be so right for me. Why did we tell you then. You were always the golden boy then. And that you'd never lose the light in your eyes. Hey you... did you ever realize what you'd become. And did you see that it wasn't only me. you were running from. Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway. Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes. The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty. I thought of you and the years. and all the sadness fell away from me. And did you know.... I never thought that you'd lose the light in your eyes. Marooned. A Great Day for Freedom. On the day the wall came down. They threw the locks onto the ground. And with glasses high we raised. a cry for freedom had arrived. On the day the wall came down. The Ship of Fools had finally run aground. Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight. I dreamed you had left my side. No warmth, not even pride remained. And even though you needed me. It was clear that I could not do a thing for you. Now life devalues day by day. As friends and neighbours turn away. And there's a change that, even with regret,. cannot be undone. Now frontiers shift like desert sands. While nations wash their blooded hands. Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey. I woke to the sound of drums. The music played, the morning sun streamed in. I turned and I looked at you. And all but the bitter residue slipped away... slipped away. Wearing the Inside Out. From morning to night I stayed out of sight. Didn't recognise I'd become. No more than alive I'd barely survive. In a word... overrun. Won't hear a sound (He's curled into the corner). From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering). I've spent too long (With and endless stream of garbage to). On the inside out (... curse the place). My skin is cold (In a sea of random images). To the human touch (The self-destructing animal). This bleeding heart's. (Waiting for the waves to break). Not beating much. I murmured a vow of silence and now. I don't even hear when I think aloud. Extinguished by light I turn on the night. Wear its darkness with an empty smile. I'm creeping back to life. My nervous system all awry. I'm wearing the inside out. Look at him now. He's paler somehow. But he's coming around. He's starting to choke. It's been so long since he spoke. Well he can have the words right from my mouth. And with these words I can see. Clear through the clouds that covered me. Just give it time then speak my name. Now we can hear ourselves again. I'm holding out (He's standing on the threshold). For the day (Caught in fiery anger). When all the clouds. (And hurled into the furnace he'll). Have blown away (... curse the place). I'm with you now. (He's torn in all directions). Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering). Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break). Ourselves again. Take it Back. Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze. I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea. I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire. We were spinning into darkness, t. he earth was on fire. She could take it back. he might take it back some day. So I spy on her, I lie to her,. I make promises I cannot keep. Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep. And I make her prove her love for me,. I take all that I can take. And I push her to the limit to see if she will break. She might take it back,. she could take it back some day. Now I have seen the warnings,. screaming from all sides. It's eay to ignore them and G-d knows I've tried. All of this temptation, it turned my faith to lies. Until I couldn't see the danger. or hear the rising tide. She can take it back, she will take it back some day. She can take it back, she will take it back some day. She will take it back, she will take it back some day. Coming Back to Life. Where were you when I was burned and broken. While the days slipped by from my window watching. Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless. Because the things you say. and the things you do surround me. While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words. Dying to believe in what you heard. I was staring straight into the shining sun. Lost in thought and lost in time. While the seeds of life and the seeds of were planted. Outside the rain fell dark and slow. While I pondered on this dangerous. but irresistable pastime. I took a heavenly ride through our silence. I knew the moment had arrived. For killing the past and coming back to life. I took a heavenly ride through our silence. I knew the waiting had begun. And headed straight... into the shining son. Keep Talking. For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened. which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk. There's a silence surrounding me. I can't seem to think straight. I'll sit in the corner. No one can bother me. I think I should speak now. (Why won't you talk to me). I can't seem to speak now (You never talk to me). My words won't come out right. (What are you thinking). I feel like I'm drowning. (What are you feeling). I'm feeling weak now. (Why won't you talk to me). But I can't show my weakness. (You never talk to me). I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking). Where do we go from here (What are you feeling). It doesn't have to be like this. All we need to do. is make sure we keep talking. Why won't you alk to me. (I feel like I'm drowning). You never talk to me. (You know I can't breathe now). What are you thinking. (We're going nowhere). What are you feeling. (We're going nowhere). Why won't you talk to me. You never talk to me. What are you thinking. Where do we go from here. It doesn't have to be like this. All we need to do. is make sure we keep talking. Lost for Words. I was spending my time in the doldrums. I was caught in a cauldron of hate. I felt persecuted and paralysed. I thought that everythign else would just wait. While you are wasting your time on your enemies. Engulfed in a fever of spite. Beyond your tunnel vision, reality fades. Like shadows into the night. To martyr yourself to caution. Is not going to help at all. Because there'll be no safety in numbers. When the Right One walks out of the door. Can you see your days blighted by darkness?. Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?. Stuck in a world of isolation. While the ivy grows over your door. So I opened my door to my enemies. And I ask could we wipe the slate clean. But they tell me to please go fuck myself. You know you just can't win. High Hopes. Beyond the horizon of the place we lived. when we were young. In a world of magnets and miracles. Our thoughts strayed. constantly and without boundary. The ringing of the division bell had begun. Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway. Do they still meet there by the Cut?. There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps. Running before time took. our dreams away. Leaving the myriad small creatures. trying to tie us to the ground. To a life consumed by slow decay. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. With friends surrounded. The nights of wonder. Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us. To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side. Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again. Dragged by the force of some inner tide. At a higher altitude with flag unfurled. We reached the dizzy heights. of that dreamed of world. Encumbered forever by desire and ambition. There's a hunger still unsatisfied. Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon. Though down this road we've been so many times. The grass was greener. The light was brighter. The taste was sweeter. The nights of wonder. With friends surrounded. The dawn mist glowing. The water flowing. The endless river. Forever and ever"
the dogs of war,"Dogs of war and men of hate. With no cause, we don't discriminate. Discovery is to be disowned. Our currency is flesh and bone. Hell opened up and put on sale. Gather 'round and haggle. For hard cash, we will lie and deceive. Even our masters don't know the web we weave. One world, it's a battleground. One world, and we will smash it down. One world ... One world. Invisible transfers, long distance calls,. Hollow laughter in marble halls. Steps have been taken, a silent uproar. Has unleashed the dogs of war. You can't stop what has begun. Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion. We all have a dark side, to say the least. And dealing in death is the nature of the beast. One world, it's a battleground. One world, and we will smash it down. One world ... One world. The dogs of war don't negotiate. The dogs of war won't capitulate,. They will take and you will give,. And you must die so that they may live. You can knock at any door,. But wherever you go, you know they've been there before. Well winners can lose and things can get strained. But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain.. One world, it's a battleground. One world, and we will smash it down. One world ... One world."
the final cut,"Through the fish-eyed lens. Of tear stained eyes. I can barely define. The shape of this moment in time.. And far from flying high. In clear blue skies.. I'm spiralling down. To the hole in the ground where I hide.. If you negotiate. The minefield in the drive,. And beat the dogs and cheat the cold. Electronic eyes.. And if you make it. Past the shotgun in the hall,. Dial the combination, open the priesthole,. And if I'm in I'll tell you. What's behind the wall.. There's a kid who had a big hallucination. Making love to girls in magazines.. He wonders if you're sleeping. With your young found faith.. Could anybody love him. Or is it just a crazy dream?. And if I show you my dark side,. Will you still hold me tonight?. And if I open my heart to you. And show you my weak side. What would you do?. Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?. Would you take the children away. And leave me alone?. And smile in reassurance. As you whisper down the phone?. Would you send me packing?. Or would you take me home?. Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings,. Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.. I held the blade in trembling hands. Prepared to make it but. Just then the phone ring. I never had the nerve to make the final cut.. ""Hello? Listen, I think I've got it.. Okay, listen its a Haha!"""

He wore a scarlet tunic,. A blue green hood,. It looked quite good.. He had a big adventure. Amidst the grass. Fresh air at last.. Wining, dining, biding his time.. And then one day - hooray!. Another way for gnomes to say. Oooooooooomray.. Look at the sky, look at the river. Isn't it good?. Look at the sky, look at the river. Isn't it good?. Winding, finding places to go..

I'll get my kicks on the way.. Over the mountains, across the seas. Who knows what will be waiting for me?. I could sail forever. To straits unnamed.. Faces of people and places don't change..

the gunner's dream,"Floating down through the clouds. Memories come rushing up to meet me now.. In the space between the heavens. and in the corner of some foreigh field. I had a dream.. I had a dream.. Goodbye Max.. Goodbye Ma.. After the service when you're walking slowly to the car. And the silver in her hair shines in the cold november air. You hear the tolling bell. And touch the silk in your lapel. And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band. You take her frail hand. And hold on to the dream.. A place to stay. ""Oi! A real one ..."". Enough to eat. Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street. Where you can speak out loud. About your doubts and fears. And whats more no-one ever disappears. You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door.. You can relax on both sides of the tracks. And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control. And everyone has recourse to the law. And no-one kills the children anymore.. And no one kills the children anymore.. Night after night. Going round and round my brain. His dream is driving me insane.. In the corner of some foreign field. The gunner sleeps tonight.. What's done is done.. We cannot just write off his final scene.. Take heed of his dream.. Take heed."
the happiest days of our lives,"""You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds,. stand still lady!"". When we grew up and went to school. There were certain teachers who would. Hurt the children in any way they could. (oof!). By pouring their derision. Upon anything we did. And exposing every weakness. However carefully hidden by the kids. But in the town it was well known. When they got home at night,. their fat and. Psychopathic wives would thrash them. Within inches of their lives."
the hero's return,"Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about?. Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape.. When I was their age all the lights went out.. There was no time to whine or mope about.. And even now part of me flies over. Dresden at Angels One Five.. Though they'll never fathom it behind my. Sarcasm desperate memories lie.. Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good.. 'Cause that's the only time. That I can really speak to you.. And there is something that I've locked away.. A memory that is too painful. To withstand the light of day.. When we came back from the war the banners and. Flags hung on everyone's door.. We danced and we sang in the street and. The church bells rang.. But burning in my heart. My memory smoulders on. Of the gunners dying words. On the intercom."
"the narrow way, part iii","Following the path as it leads towards. The darkness in the North. Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy. They've seen that hope before. But if you want to stay for a little bit. Rest your aching limbs for a little bit. Before you, the night is beckoning. And you know you can't delay. You hear the night birds calling you. But you can't catch the words they say. Close your ears and eyes, be on your way. Mist is swirling, creatures crawling. Hear the roar get louder in your ears. You know, the folly was your own. But the force behind can't conquer all your fears. And if you want to stay for a little bit. Rest your aching limbs for a little bit. Before you, the night is beckoning. And you know you can't delay. You hear the night birds calling you. But you can't catch the words they say. Close your ears and eyes, be on your way. Pull your thoughts back many years. To the time when there was life with every morning. Perhaps a day will come. When the light will be as clear as on that morning. And if you want to stay for a little bit. Rest your aching limbs for a little bit. Before you, the night is beckoning. And you know you can't delay. You hear the night birds calling you. But you can't catch the words they say.

the nile song,"I was standing by the Nile. When I saw the lady smile.. I would take her out for a while,. For a while.. Oh, my tears wept like a child.. How her golden hair was blowing wild.. Then she spread her wings to fly,. For to fly.. Soaring high above the breezes,. Going always where she pleases.. She will make it to the islands in the sun.. I will follow in her shadow. As I watch her from my window.. One day I will catch her eye.. She is calling from the deep,. Summoning my soul to endless sleep.. She is bound to drag me down,. Drag me down."

the scarecrow,The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows. Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere.. He didn't care.. He stood in a field where barley grows.. His head did no thinking.

time,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day. You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town. Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.. Tired of lying in the sunshine. Staying home to watch the rain.. You are young and life is long. And there is time to kill today.. And then one day you find. Ten years have got behind you.. No one told you when to run,. You missed the starting gun.. And you run and you run to catch up with the sun. But it's sinking. And racing around to come up behind you again.. The sun is the same in a relative way. But you're older,. Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.. Every year is getting shorter. Never seem to find the time.. Plans that either come to naught. Or half a page of scribbled lines. Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way. The time has gone, the song is over,. Thought I'd something more to say.. Home, home again. I like to be here when I can. When I come home cold and tired. It's good to warm my bones beside the fire. Far away, across the field. The tolling of the iron bell. Calls the faithful to their knees. To hear the softly spoken magic spells"
two suns in the sunset,"In my rear view mirror. The sun is going down.. Sinking behind bridges in the road.. And I think of all the good things. That we have left undone.. And I suffer premonitions,. Confirm suspicions. Of the holocaust to come.. The rusty wire that holds the cork. That keeps the anger in. Gives way and suddenly it's day again.. The sun is in the east. Even though the day is done.. Two suns in the sunset. Hmmmmmmmmmm. Could be the human race is run?. Like the moment when the brakes lock. And you slied towards the big truck. You stretch the frozen moments with your fear.. ""Oh no!"". And you'll never hear their voices. ""Daddy, Daddy!"". And you'll never see their faces. You have no recourse to the law anymore.. And as the windshield melts. My tears eveaporate. Leaving only charcoal to defend.. Finally I understand the feelings of the few.. Ashes and diamonds. Foe and friend. We were all equal in the end.. ""...and now the weather.. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers. spreading from the east ... with an expected. high of 4000 degrees Celsius..."""

Haven't you heard it's a battle of words. The poster bearer cried. Listen son, said the man with the gun. There's room for you inside. ""I mean, they're not gunna kill ya. so if you give 'em a quick short. sharp, shock, they won't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off. lightly, 'cos I would've given him a thrashing.

vegetable man,"In yellow shoes I get the blues. Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet. With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink. There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers.

And I covered them up with the latest cut,. And my pants and socks all point in a box,. They don't make long of my nylon socks,. The watch, black watch. My watch with a black face. And a big pin, a little hole,. And all the lot is what I got,. It's what I wear, it's what you see,. It must be me, it's what I am,. Vegetable man..

I'm not the one you need. What do you want from me. You can have anything you want. You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water. Anything you want. You can own everything you see. Sell your soul for complete control. Is that really what you need. You can lose yourself this night. See inside there is nothing to hide. Turn and face the light. What do you want from me"
what shall we do now,What shall we use to fill the empty spaces. Where waves of hunger roar. Shall we set out across this sea of faces. In search of more and more applause. Shall we buy a new guitar. Shall we drive a more powerful car. Shall we work straight  through the night. Shall we get into fights. Leave the lights on. Drop bombs. Do tours of the East. Contract diseases. Bury bones. Break up homes. Send flowers by phone. Take to drink. Go to shrinks. Give up meat. Rarely sleep. Keep people as pets. Train dogs. Race rats. Fill the attic with cash. Bury treasure. Store up leisure. But never relax at all. With our backs to the wall
when the tigers broke free,"It was just before dawn,. One miserable morning. in black forty-four.. when the forward commander was told to sit tight. when he asked that his men be withdrawn.. And the generals gave thanks as the other ranks. Held back the enemy tanks - for a while.. And then the Anzio beachhead was held for the price. Of a few hundred ordinary lives.. And kind old King George sent mother a note. When he heard that father was gone. It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll. with golden leaf and all.. And I found it one day in a drawer of old photographs,. Hidden away.. And my eyes still grow damp to remember. His Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp. It was dark all around. There was frost in the ground. When the tigers broke free. And no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers Company C.. They were all left behind.. Most of them dead,. The rest of them dying. And that's how the High Command. Took my Daddy. From me."
wined and dined,"Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!. Girl was so kind.. kind of love I'd never seen. only last summer, it's not so long ago.... just last summer, now musk winds blow.... Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!. Girl was so kind.. kind of love I'd never seen. only last summer, it's not so long ago.... just last summer, now musk winds blow.... Chalk underfoot, life I should prove. dancing in heat, our love and you.... Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!. Girl was so kind.. kind of love I'd never seen. only last summer, it's not so long ago.... just last summer, now musk winds blow...."
wish you were here,"So, so you think you can tell. Heaven from Hell. Blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field. From a cold steel rail?. A smile from a veil?. Do you think you can tell?. Did they get you to trade. Your heroes for ghosts?. Hot ashes for trees?. Hot air for a cool breeze?. Cold comfort for change?. Did you exchange. A walk on part in the war. For a lead role in a cage?. How I wish. How I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls. Swimming in a fish bowl. Year after year. Running over the same old ground. What have we found?. The same old fears. Wish you were here"

wolfpack,"Howling the pack in formation appears. diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead. waving us back in formation,. the pack in formation. bowling they bat as a group. and the leader is seen - so early.... the pack on their backs, the fighters. through misty the waving - the pack in formation. far reaching waves. on sight, shone right. I lay as if in surround.... all enmeshing, hovering.... the milder I gaze. all the animals laying trail. beyond the bough winds. mild the reflecting electricity eyes.... tears, the life that was ours. grows sharper and stronger away and beyond. short wheeling - fresh spring. gripped with blanched bones - moaned. magnesium, proverbs and sobs.... howling the pack in formation appears. diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead. waving us back in formation,. the pack in formation...."
wots...uh the deal,"Heaven sent the promised land. Looks all right from where I stand. Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in. Waiting on the first step. Show me where the key is kept. Point me down the right line because it's time. To let me in from the cold. Turn my lead into gold. Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul. And I think I'm growing old. Flash the readies, wot's...uh the deal?. Got to make it to the next meal. Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel. Mile after mile. Stone after stone. You turn to speak, but you're alone. Million miles from home, you're on your own. So let me in from the cold. Turn my lead into gold. Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul. And I think I'm growing old. Fire bright by candlelight. And her by my side. And if she prefers, we need never stir again. Someone sent the promised land. And I grabbed it with both hands. Now I'm the man on the inside lookin' out. Hear me shout ""Come on in,. What's the news, and where you've been?"". Cause there's no wind left in my soul. And I've grown old"
yet another movie,"Yet Another Movie. One sound, one single sound. One kiss, one single kiss. A face outside the window pane. However did it come to this?. A man who ran, a child who cried. A girl who heard, a voice that lied. The sun that burned a fiery red. The vision of an empty bed. The use of force, he was so tough. She'll soon submit, she's had enough. The march of fate, the broken will. Someone is lying very still. He has laughed and he has cried. He has fought and he has died. He's just the same as all the rest. He's not the worst, he's not the best. And still this ceaseless murmuring. The babbling that I brook. The seas of faces, eyes upraised. The empty screen, the vacant look. A man in black on a snow white horse,. A pointless life has run its course,. The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run. As he fades into the setting sun"
you gotta be crazy,"You gotta be crazy, you gotta be mean. You gotta keep your kids and your car clean. You gotta keep climbing, you gotta keep fit. You gotta keep smiling, you gotta eat shit. You gotta be small to be a big shot. You gotta eat meat to stay at the top. You gotta be trusted, gotta tell lies. You gotta be able to narrow your eyes. You gotta beleive they've gotta beleive you. You gotta appear easy to see through. Gotta be sure you look good on the TV. Gotta resemble a human being. You gotta keep one eye over your shoulder. Gonna get harder as you get older. Gotta fly south and hide in the sand. Gotta forget that you're gonna get cancer. And when you loose control. You'll reap the harvest you have sown. And as the fear grows. The bad blood slows and turns to stone. And it's too late to loose the weight. You used to need to throw around. So have a good drown. As you go down. Alone. Dragged down by the stone. Gotta be sure, you gotta be quick. Gotta divide the tame from the sick. Gotta keep some of us docile and fit. You gotta keep everyone burying this shit. You gotta get you started early. Processed by the time you're thirty. Work like fuck 'till you're sixty five. And then your time's your own until you die. I gotta admit to a lot of confusion. Pain in the head is the child of collusion. Gotta resist the creeping malaise. You gotta beleive in the way you get out of the maze. But you, you just keep on pretending. You can tell a sucker from a friend. But you still raise the knife to. Stranger, lover, friend and foe alike. Who was born in a house full of pain. Who was sent out to play on his own. Who was raised on a diet of shame. Who was trained not to spit in the fan. Who was told what to do by the man. Who was broken by trained personnel. Who was fitted with bridle and bit. Who was given a seat in the stand. Who was forcing his way to the rails. Who was offered a place on the board. Who was only a stranger at home. Who was ground down in the end. Who was found dead on the phone. Who was dragged down by the stone"
young lust,"I am just a new boy,. Stranger in this town.. Where are all the good times?. Who's gonna show this stranger around?. Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.. Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.. Will some woman in this desert land. Make me feel like a real man?. Take this rock and roll refugee. Oooh, baby set me free.. Ooooh, I need a dirty woman.. Ooooh, I need a dirty girl.. [Phone rings]. ""Hello..?"". ""Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.. Will you accept the charges from United States?"". [Phone being put down]. ""Oh, He hung up! That's your residence, right?. I wonder why he hung up.... Is there supposed to be someone else there. besides your wife there to answer?"". [Phone rings again]. ""Hello?"". ""This is United States calling,. are we reaching.... [interrupted by phone being put down]. ""See he keeps hanging up, and. it's a man answering."". [whirr of connection being closed]"
your possible pasts,"They flutter behind you your possible pasts,. Some brighteyed and crazy,. some frightened and lost.. A warning to anyone still in command. Of their possible future, to take care.. In derelict sidings the poppies entwine. With cattle trucks lying in wait. For the next time.. Do you remember me?. How we used to be?. Do you think we shoud be closer?. She stood in the doorway,. the ghost of a smile. Haunting her face. Like a cheap hotel sign.. Her cold eyes imploring. The men in their macs. For the gold in their bags. Or the knives in their backs.. Stepping up boldly. One put out his hand.. He said: ""I was just a child then,. Now I'm only a man."". Do you remember me? How we used to be?. Do you think we should be closer?. By the cold and religious. We were taken in hand.. Shown how to feel good. And told to feel bad.. And strung out behind us. The banners and flags of our possible pasts. Lie in tatters and rags.. Do you remember me? How we used to be?. Do you think we should be closer?"
