my apocalypse,There's a place that I've found. As far as I can see. This place lies within. The depths of my dreams. In a garden surrounded. By fire and trees. Through the smoke a silhouette I can barely see. There's a man with an axe. Standing in the rain. Looked me straight in my eye. This is what he had to say. Never fall asleep. You won't wake up. Destroy the guillotine. Before he does. I walk with shadows. (You have to find a better way). I walk with shadows. (The questions I will never say). Hiding from the gallows. (They keep me safe and sound). So I walk in shadows. (The ways of burning down this house). End transmission. The satellites are down. I need an earthquake. To shake this pity. Off the ground. Just don't trust these liars at the door. (You have to find a better way). Kill the ones that have these answers for. (The questions I will never say). All the vibrant colors I see. And the shades that fill the grey. Pain!. The Pain!. Hiding from the gallows. (You have to find a better way). I walk with shadows. (The questions I will never say). Hiding from the gallows. (They keep me safe and sound). So I walk in shadows. (The ways of burning down this house)

digging my own grave,"Bury me, I can't breath. Rescue me, darkness consuming. Tempting me, separate. Let me free from the darkness inside me. Shadows take my hands as my mind begins to stray.

Cause I don't wanna see the worst in you. Swimmin towards me through the shadows. In a presence of light. I'm reaching out my hands. With my fingers to the sky. So tell me what I have to do. I don't wanna tell you to. I just wanna be with you. I just wanna make it through. I just wanna make it through this life. Yeah, yeah. Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna, I just wanna. Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna, I just wanna. Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna, I just wanna. Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna, make it through this life. I don't wanna be demanding. I just wanna know the reasons why. We live and die in a world of lies. Addicted to the way we crash and burn. I gave it all away now it's your turn. Watching me watching you. Don't wanna see the worst in you. So don't let this come true. Cause I don't wanna see the worst in you"

I'd do things differently. Isn't it too late now?. Will someone answer me?. Chorus. I can't escape. Chorus. (yesterday). I hold a place (yesterday). Time won't erase. I can't escape from yesterday (yesterday). Look away (yesterday). To face the truth. I can't escape from yesterday. Yeah"

zombie dance,"Take my flesh from me, put it on display. We've got miles to feed, I'm sick of running away. I can't believe my eyes, I'm terrified. Life full of death and some say end of times. Seems to take a piece of me tonight and soon I'll beg. Coming, Coming, Coming for.... You!. Every time we touch. Girl, you know you got me on pins and needles. Oh!. It's not about the lust. Now you know you got me on pins and needles. We're already dead (x3). We're already.... I love the way that you bleed it's slippin over me. My tongue is loving the taste, the skin between my teeth. It's like a dead mascarade so come and dance with me. My flesh it starts to decay I'm droppin to my knees. You. Every time we touch. Girl you know you got me on pins and needles. Oh!. It's not about the lust. Now you know you got me on pins and needles. You had me in a trance?. I'm where the worms grow dead people play. And now I know it's my soul that is fading. Fading decaying fortune I'm dazing. We're already dead (x3). We're already.... You!. Everytime we touch. Girl you know you got me on pins and needles. Oh!. It's not about the lust. Now you know you got me on pins and needles. Every time we touch you got me on. Pins and needles. Girl you know you've got me. On pins and needles. We're already dead (x3). We're already..."
