every little thing she does is magic,Though I've tried before to tell her. Of the feelings I have for her in my heart. Every time that I come near her. I just lose my nerve. As I've done from the start. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she does just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Do I have to tell the story. Of a thousand rainy days since we first met. It's a big enough umbrella. But it's always me that ends up getting wet. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she does just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day. And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way. But my silent fears have gripped me. Long before I reach the phone. Long before my tongue has tripped me. Must I always be alone?. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she does just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on

Something crawls from the slime. At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake. Another industrial ugly morning. The factory belches filth into the sky. He walks unhindered through the picket lines today. He doesn't think to wonder why. The secretaries pout and preen like. cheap tarts in a red light street. But all he ever thinks to do is watch. And every single meeting with his so-called superior. Is a humiliating kick in the crotch. Many miles away. Something crawls to the surface. Of a dark Scottish lake. Another working day has ended. Only the rush hour hell to face. Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes. Contestants in a suicidal race. Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance. He knows that something somewhere has to break. He sees the family home now looming in the headlights. The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache. Many miles away. There's a shadow on the door. Of a cottage on the shore. Of a dark Scottish lake. Many miles away, many miles away"

And your brother’s going to kill me and he’s six feet ten. I guess you’d call it cowardice. But I’m not prepared to go on like this. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t. I can’t stand losing you. I can’t stand losing you. I can’t stand losing you. I can’t stand losing you. I see you’ve sent my letters back. And my lp records and they’re all scratched. I can’t see the point in another day. When nobody listens to a word I say. You can call it lack of confidence. But to carry on living doesn’t make no sense. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I guess this is our last goodbye. And you don’t care, so I won’t cry. But you’ll be sorry when I’m dead. And all this guilt will be on your head. I guess you’d call it suicide. But I’m too full to swallow my pride. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stand losing.

deathwish,Deathwish in the fading light. Headlight pointing through the night. Never thought I’d see the day. Playing with my life this way. Gotta keep my foot right down. If I had wings I’d leave the ground. Buning in the outside lane. People think that I’m insane. The day I take a bend too fast. Judgement that could be my last. I’ll be wiped right off the slate. Don’t wait up ’cause I’ll be late

My shots will always misfire. My shots will always miss. Does everyone stare this way at you?. I only look this way at you. I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date. I get the heebie-jeebies, and my panic makes me late. I break into a cold sweat reaching for the phone. I let it ring twice before I chicken out and decide you’re not at home.

don't stand so close to me,"Young teacher the subject. Of schoolgirl fantasy. She wants him so badly. Knows what she wants to be. Inside her there's longing. This girl's an open page.

driven to tears,"How can you say that you’re not responsible?. What does it have to do with me?. What is my reaction, what should it be?. Confronted by this latest atrocity. Driven to tears. Hide my face in my hands, shame wells in my throat. My comfortable existance is reduced to a shallow meaningless party. Seems that when some innocent die. All we can offer them is a page in a some magazine. Too many cameras and not enough food. ’cos this is what we’ve seen. Driven to tears. Protest is futile, nothing seems to get through. What’s to become of our world, who knows what to do. Driven to tears"

every little thing she does is magic,Though I've tried before to tell her. Of the feelings I have for her in my heart. Every time that I come near her. I just lose my nerve. As I've done from the start. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she does just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Do I have to tell the story. Of a thousand rainy days since we first met. It's a big enough umbrella. But it's always me that ends up getting wet. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she does just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day. And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way. But my silent fears have gripped me. Long before I reach the phone. Long before my tongue has tripped me. Must I always be alone?. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she does just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on

nothing achieving,My daddy's boots don't fit me. 'Cause I'm bigger than him. He says I make him big now. I'm bigger than him. You see there's nothing worth achieving. All your dreams are just deceiving. You've locked the doors on your good living. And you told me to wait. You've got me backed into a corner. You're making me hate. I say there's nothing worth achieving. All your dreams are just deceiving. [They say there's nothing worth achieving. All your dreams are just deceiving]. Throwing stones that are reeling. From a reasonable light. You muscle in when I have a party. Ready to fight. I say there's nothing worth achieving. All your dreams are just deceiving. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Por Nelson Portela
oh my god,"Everyone I know is lonely. And God´s so far away. And my heart belongs to no one. So now sometines I pray. Take the space between us. And fill it up some way. Take the space between us. And fill it up, fill it up!. Oh my God you take the biscuit. Treating me this way. Expecting me totreat you well. Don´t matter what you say. How can I turn the other cheek?. It´s black and bruised and torn. I´ve been waiting. Since the day that I was born.... Take the space between us. And fill iy up some way. Take the space between us. And fill it up!.

omegaman,"The night came down, jungle sounds were in my ears. City screams are all I’ve heard in twenty years. The razor’s edge of night, it cuts into my sleep. I sit upon the edge now. Shall I make that leap?. I’m the omegaman. I’m the omegaman. The sky’s alive with turned on television sets. I walk the streets and seek another vision yet. The echo makes me turn to see that last frontier. The edge of time closes down as I disappear. I’m the omegaman. I’m the omegaman. I’m the omegaman. I’m the omegaman. Always talking to myself. Oh!. The time that’s best is when surroundings fade away. The presense of another world comes close to me. It’s time for me to throw away this paper knife. I’m not alone in reaching for a perfect life. I’m the omegaman. I’m the omegaman. I’m the omegaman. I’m the omegaman. I’m so tired. Of the omegaman"
on any other day,The other one was a complete bullshit. You want something corny?. You got it. There’s a house on my street. And it looks real neat. I’m the chap who lives in it. There’s a tree on the sidewalk. There’s a car by the door. I’ll go for a drive in it. And when the wombat comes. He will find me gone. He’ll look for a place to sit. My wife has burned the scrambled eggs. The dog just bit my leg. My teenage daughter ran away. My fine young son has turned out gay. Cut off my fingers in the. Door of my car. How could I do it?. My wife is proud to tell me. Of her love affairs. How could she do this to me?. My wife has burned the scrambled eggs. The dog just bit my leg. My teenage daughter ran away. My fine young son has turned out gay. And it would be ok on any other day. And it would be ok on any other day. Throw down the morning papers. And spill my tea. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. The cups and plates are in a. Conspiracy. I’m covered in misery. My wife has burned the scrambled eggs. The dog just bit my leg. My teenage daughter ran away. My fine young son has turned out gay. And it would be ok on any other day. And it would be ok on any other day. And it would be ok on any other day
once upon a daydream,Once upon a daydream. I fell in love with you. Once upon a moonbeam. I gave that love to you. Once upon a lifetime. I know it must be true. When the months had turned us. I'd have to marry you. Once upon a daydream. Doesn't happen anymore. Once upon a moonbeam. This is no place for tenderness. Once her daddy found out. He threw her to the floor. He killed her unborn baby. And kicked me from the door. Once upon a nightmare. I bought myself a gun. I blew her daddy's brains out. Now hell has just begun. Once upon a daydream. Doesn't happen anymore. Once upon a moonbeam. This is no place for sentiment. Once upon a lifetime. A lifetime filled with tears. The boy would pay for his crime. With all his natural years. Once upon a daydream. He'd make you his someday. Once upon a moonbeam. He'd dream his life away. Once upon a daydream. Doesn't happen anymore. Once upon a moonbeam. This is no place for miracles. Once upon a daydream. Once upon a daydream. Once upon a daydream. Once upon a day... dream. Por Nelson Portela

russians,"In Europe and America there's a growing feeling of hysteria. Conditioned to respond to all the threats. In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets. Mister Krushchev said, 'We will bury you'. I don't subscribe to this point of view. It'd be such an ignorant thing to do. If the Russians love their children too. How can I save my little boy. From Oppenheimer's deadly toy?. There is no monopoly on common sense. On either side of the political fence. We share the same biology. Regardless of ideology. Believe me when I say to you. I hope the Russians love their children too. There is no historical precedent to put. Words in the mouth of the president. There's no such thing as a winnable war.

He pointed to the rain. You will see light in the darkness. You will make some sense of this. And when you’ve made your secret journey. You will find the love you miss. And on the days that followed. I listened to his words. I strained to understand him. I chased his thoughts like birds. You will see light in the darkness. You will make some sense of this.

You will find this love you miss. And when you’ve made your secret journey. You will be a holy man

someone to talk to,"Though it's me that's on fire not this cigarette. I was stabbed in the back by that young suffragette. And what do I care if she leaves me alone. If I need somebody I'll pick up the phone. I'll put on my good face, clean up the flat. I'm starting all over good bye to all that. Put on some music and pour out a drink.

Someone to talk to, Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to, Someone to talk to. She was a person I just couldn't see. And I tried to make her what she couldn't be. We tried and we tried, but of course in the end. I drove her crazy and right 'round the bend. Now it's too much to just sit here and cry. I can't be seen with a tear in my eye. Why am I standing right next to the phone?. When I kept on saying I must be alone. Someone to talk to, Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to, Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to, Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to, Someone to talk to. Someone to talk to, Someone to talk to. I love you, why didn't I say that before.

And one day I'll learn just which part of me bleeds. Now that she's gone I know she was great. But I fucked it up and now it's too late. Someone to talk to, Someone to talk to.

synchronicity ii,"Another suburban family morning. Grandmother screaming at the wall. We have to shout above the din of our Rice Crispies. We can't hear anything at all. Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration. But we know all her suicides are fake. Daddy only stares into the distance. There's only so much more that he can take. Many miles away. Something crawls from the slime. At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake. Another industrial ugly morning. The factory belches filth into the sky. He walks unhindered through the picket lines today. He doesn't think to wonder why. The secretaries pout and preen like. cheap tarts in a red light street. But all he ever thinks to do is watch. And every single meeting with his so-called superior. Is a humiliating kick in the crotch. Many miles away. Something crawls to the surface. Of a dark Scottish lake. Another working day has ended. Only the rush hour hell to face. Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes. Contestants in a suicidal race. Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance. He knows that something somewhere has to break. He sees the family home now looming in the headlights. The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache. Many miles away. There's a shadow on the door. Of a cottage on the shore. Of a dark Scottish lake. Many miles away, many miles away"
tea in the sahara,My sisters and i. Have the wish before we die. And it may sound strange. As if our minds are deranged. Please don’t ask us why. Beneath the sheltering sky. We have this strange obsession. You have the means in your possession. Tea in the sahara with you. Tea in the sahara with you. The young man agreed. He would satisfy their need. So they danced for this pleasure. With a joy you could not measure. They would wait for him here. The same place every year. Beneath the sheltering sky. Across the desert he would fly. Tea in the sahara with you. Tea in the sahara with you. Tea in the sahara with you. Tea in the sahara with you. The sky turned to black. Would he ever come back. They would climb a high dune. They would pray to the moon. But he’d never return. So the sisters would burn. As their eyes searched the land. With their cups still full of sand. Tea in the sahara with you.
