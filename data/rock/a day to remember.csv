This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me. I’ve read these stories a thousand times, and now I’ll rewrite them all. You’re meddling in an anger you can’t control. She means the world to me, so hold your serpent tongue. Is a whores lies worth dying for? I'll just take my time. The only thing that's going to bother me. Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends. Why cant you look me in the eyes one last time?. The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name. Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you. This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me. I walked into your house this morning.

casablanca sucked anyway,I’ve spent so much time trying to fix your life that I forgot about mine.. This time I’m putting my foot straight through the floor.. You wont be walking through any of my doors anymore.. So tell me what’s so wrong with me that you could leave so easily.. You threw this all away for the chance to leave me.. She makes me happy.. She sparks a light inside you’ve never failed to blow out.. Look at everything.. Look at all that you’ve become…nothing more than a memory.. So tell me what’s so wrong with me that you could leave so easily.. You threw this all away for the chance to leave me.. You make me sick with every move you make.. When will you find your place in this world?. Cause it will never be beside me again.. So tell me what’s so wrong with me that you could leave so easily.. You threw this all away for the chance to leave me.
if looks could kill,"Something’s wrong and it’s not me for once, and I know you’ll call me crazy…. but I hate the way you look straight through me.. What have I don’t that’s so wrong?. Remember me when I’m so far from your reach,. and then you’ll know you had your chance.. Take one more glance, and that’s the end of our romance.. You’ve turned your back on me for the last time.. Remember when we use to be friends?. Nothing could ever go wrong, or so we thought,. but I guess you’ve changed a lot since we were young.. Times will change, and there’s nothing I can say to right all of your wrongs.. Just grow up, and pray we’ll keep in touch.. You’ve turned your back on me for the last time.. I still dream of the day that I watched you choke.. They’ll act like I’m so crazy when they find you dead on my floor.. Right now.. I’d say something went wrong in our lives, and I pray that god saves us before we die.. He’s everything that you could never be.. Right now.. I’d say something went wrong in our lives, and I pray that god saves us before we die.. Slowly die."

Held trapped by what we were. No, I'll never feel the same. Same about you, same about you. No, I'll never feel the same. Same about you, same about you. Spent time today reminiscing. Think I learned a lot about who we are. Couldn't diagnose your condition. But now I see the signs you've left behind. Think I lost my nerve. Like I lost you. Held trapped by what we were. No, I'll never feel the same. Same about you, same about you. No, I'll never feel the same. Same about you, same about you. Some roads you can't come back. From when you extract truth from the lie.

Remember me when I’m so far from your reach,. and then you’ll know you had your chance.. Take one more glance, and that’s the end of our romance.. You’ve turned your back on me for the last time.. Remember when we use to be friends?. Nothing could ever go wrong, or so we thought,. but I guess you’ve changed a lot since we were young.. Times will change, and there’s nothing I can say to right all of your wrongs.. Just grow up, and pray we’ll keep in touch.. You’ve turned your back on me for the last time.. I still dream of the day that I watched you choke.. They’ll act like I’m so crazy when they find you dead on my floor.. Right now.. I’d say something went wrong in our lives, and I pray that god saves us before we die.. He’s everything that you could never be.. Right now.. I’d say something went wrong in our lives, and I pray that god saves us before we die.. Slowly die."
in florida,"December ain't cold at all this year in Florida.. But I'm still chilled to the bone.. The mind plays tricks this time of year in Florida.. It's not the time to be alone.. I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.. I feel to understand it starts from the inside.. And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time.. To be good with your own life's to be good with mine.. Time stands still this time of year in Florida.. The only time I feel at home.. The neighborhood kids run down the road in Florida.. It's got me scared I missed the boat.. I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.. I feel to understand it starts from the inside.. And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time.. To be good with your own life's to be good with mine.. I always knew that I would leave,. but I didn't think it'd change a part of me.. Can't get back to who I was back then.. Feels wrong to shut that out.. Seems wrong to pretend.. I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.. I feel to understand it starts from the inside.. And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time.. To be good with your own life's to be good with mine."

This meant something to me,. there's a hole in my heart where you used to be.. I still wish you the best of luck baby,. and don't go thinking this was a waste of time.. I couldn't forget you if I tried.. You killed what was left of the good in me.. I'm tired, so let me be broken.. Look down at the mess that's in front of me.. No other words need be spoken.. I've got nobody else to blame though I tried.. Kept all our past mistakes held inside,. I'll live with regret for my whole life.. I confess, I brought this all on myself.. Condemned to suffer alone like there's nobody else.. When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me's missing,. so I'll keep living the lie,. and just hope that you're listening.. I tried to make us a life here,. but our foundation was built on sand.. No time to run until the damage was done.. I never had the upperhand.. I still wish you the best of luck baby,. and don't go thinking this was a waste of time.. I couldn't forget you if I tried.. You killed what was left of the good in me.. I'm tired, so let me be broken.. Look down at the mess that's in front of me.. No other words need be spoken.. I've got nobody else to blame though I tried.. Kept all our past mistakes held inside,. I'll live with regret for my whole life.. All the things you love are all the things I hate.. How did we get here in the first place?. I play it cool, but it's hard to be.. All my trust is slowly fading inside of me. Over what?. There can't be anymore progress, I know our fate.. Only thing that can heal this is time and space.. I still wish you the best of luck baby,. and don't go thinking this was a waste of time.. I couldn't forget you if I tried.. You killed what was left of the good in me.. I'm tired, so let me be broken.. Look down at the mess that's in front of me.. No other words need be spoken.. I've got nobody else to blame though I tried.. Kept all our past mistakes held inside,. I'll live with regret for my whole life.. For my whole life.!"
you had me at hello,"I'm missing you so much,. I'll see you die tonight. Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise. I know the signs are on and I feel this too. None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you. And I'm wasting away, away from you. What have I gotten into this time around. I know that I had sworn. I'd never trust anyone again. But I didn't have to. You had me at hello.. I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours. It's simply radiant, I feel more with everyday that goes by. I watch the clock so I can make my timing just right. Would it be okay?. Would it be okay if I took your breath away?. And I'm wasting away, away from you.. What have I gotten into this time around. I know that I had sworn. I'd never trust anyone again. But I didn't have to. You had me at hello. You gave me butterflies at the mailbox,. You had me at hello"
you should have killed me when you had the chance,"So I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes. I can hear you whispering as I walk by. Familiar faces smiling back at me and I knew.

Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends. Why cant you look me in the eyes one last time?. The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name. Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you. This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me. I walked into your house this morning. I brought the gun from our end table. Your blood was strewn across the walls. They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done. But should I write it all off?. You should have killed me when you had the chance"
