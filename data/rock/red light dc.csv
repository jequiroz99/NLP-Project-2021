cold truth,"I see you and your lover kissing on the streets. A sign that only you will pay. Forgiveness was never a good choice. Maybe someday this confusion make some sense. I've never been your only one. But you don't mind lost things along the way. If you can't see the cold truth is better close your window. I will always be with you, when you sleep alone. At six feet under, all of you will be. I'm just waiting to catch your heart again. The roses on my grave might make you smile. And day by day, day by day, I dive in my disgrace. I've never been your only one. But you don't mind lost things along the way. If you can't see the cold truth is better close your window. I will always be with you, when you sleep alone"
don't leave me,"Lost at midnight looking for some fun. I know baby, I'm crazy, I know what you want. All strange and all those drinks drag me into lust. I live my life till the day I'll turn into dust. And I'll never change. And every day I'll lie. And I'll never love you. But always want to be alive, why don't you stay by my side?. Please don't leave me. Please don't leave me. Why don't you stay by my side?. I promise to be with you, every night. It's a lie, I'm a bastard, but I'll always try. And when I wake-up lost in a motel room. I want you to believe my excuses. And I'll never change. And every day I'll lie. And I'll never love you. But always want to be alive, why don't you stay by my side?. Please don't leave me. Please don't leave me. Why don't you stay by my side?"
i don't care about death,"I left my bro to death. In a dark lonely night. He was drunk in the fight, when I saw you coming. I could be stronger and try to save him, I would not let you die. By that red lipstick I turned my back. I've not tried hard enough. I wanted to be on your bed, on your bed. I went to her dirty home. She went to her room. Police was hunting me, but I wanted the paradise. She was naked in bed, begging for my heat. Maybe mom turns upset, but I was just having fun. I want you so bad as never before. And I realized, I don't care, I don't care 'bout the death. I wanted you so much as never wanted anyone. And I realized, I don't care, I don't care about death"
i'll be here,"When you wake up from a nightmare. Come and lay in my arms. I'm here. When the world turns into black and white. Let's paint the walls with your favorite color. Life is too short to give up of. Your dreams. While you keep breathing. I will be here. It doesn't matter what they may say. You can throw it all away. And begin again. So hold my hand, I'll walk with you. For miles and miles away. We'll find our missing parts. Life is too short to give up of. Your dreams. While you keep breathing. I will be here. I'll be your light tonight. Just put your trust on me. I will always defend you. I'll be here"
live or die,"You have to decide if it's now or never. The life is a running train without a stop in heaven. The choices make it seems so good. And the girl you love make you feel so fool. Stop looking for life like a dog hunting bone. You have to decide if it's now or never. Most of dead men used to be clever. You've got mud in your hands and no gold in your pants. To survive in this world, you may believe in changes. Leave the past behind, and burn this house you call home. You are strong to turn it down. If you are sad then get off and fuck it all. Don't look back life has gone. You're alone. Your chances are getting done. To change the mess in your life. You have to decide if you wanna live or die"
scream,"Inside your cold heart. You don't have enough space. To bring us to surface again. Glorifying the mistake. One day you're gonna scream, one day. And nobody will listen. You get naked, and you get drunk. Feel like mad and sit alone. You think its too late for a call. And you realize, your life falls down. One day you're gonna scream, one day. And nobody will listen"
son of madness,I got my guns tonight. Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight. Up in the sky the aurora and the stars. Show me the way where you are. Please follow my way. Enjoy the sin and its taste. I'm a son of madness. I need some fuel to light some fire. The night is great I see in your eyes. Now shall dance all night. Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight. Please follow my way. Enjoy the sin and its taste. I'm a son of madness. I saw the angels walking down the streets. Wasting time frenzy 'round here. I saw them falling from the sadness skies. But I'm fine they'll never find me here. Please follow my way. Enjoy the sin and its taste. I'm a son of madness. They cannot find me here
survivor,"I was lost at the sea. The waves beating on me. A cold heavy storm, a storm. Lonely sinking down. But I won't drown. I survived, I survived, I survived. Where to go now. With my face, with my shame. Where to go now. With blame, with my faith. I was lost at the desert. The sand wiping on me. The hot heavy sun, the sun. The more I walk. More close I come. I survived, I survived, I survived. Where to go now. With my face, with my shame. Where to go now. With blame, with my faith"
