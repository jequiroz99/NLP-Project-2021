the american,Here comes the shake. The speed-decade wake. I see you wake. Shake. Fit on those overalls. What do you know about this world anyway. I see a man. With an airfield plan. I caught a boy fall out of the sky. What do you know about this world anyway. Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Amer-American. In collective fame. Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Amer-American. Nassau club day. Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Amer-American. Across a curved earth. In collective fame. Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Amer-American. The eventful work-outs. Nassau club days. Here comes the flag. I'm walking in the black. Every time you tough this place. It feels like sin. Every time the handshake starts. The face draws thin. What do you know about this world anyway. Here comes the son. The american son. In here the son shines so bright. Eyes blind. What do you know about this world anyway. Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Ameri-Amer-American. The eventful workouts. Nassau club days. Here comes the flag. Hand-shake. This world...... Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission.
mandela day,It was 25 years they take that man away. Now the freedom moves in closer every day. Wipe the tears down from your saddened eyes. They say Mandela's free so step outside. Oh oh oh oh Mandela day. Oh oh oh oh Mandela's free. It was 25 years ago this very day. Held behind four walls all through night and day. Still the children know the story of that man. And I know what's going on right through your land. 25 years ago. Na na na na Mandela day. Oh oh oh Mandela's free. If the tears are flowing wipe them from your face. I can feel his heartbeat moving deep inside. It was 25 years they took that man away. And now the world come down say Nelson Mandela's free. Oh oh oh oh Mandela's free. The rising suns sets Mandela on his way. Its been 25 years around this very day. From the one outside to the ones inside we say. Oh oh oh oh Mandela's free. Oh oh oh set Mandela free. Na na na na Mandela day. Na na na na Mandela's free. 25 years ago. What's going on. And we know what's going on. Cos we know what's going on.
alive and kicking,"You turn me on, you lift me up. And like the sweetest cup I'd share with you. You lift me up, don't you ever stop, I'm here with you. Now it's all or nothing. 'Cause you say you'll follow through. You follow me, and I, I, I follow you. What you gonna do when things go wrong?. What you gonna do when it all cracks up?. What you gonna do when the Love burns down?. What you gonna do when the flames go up?. Who is gonna come and turn the tide?. What's it gonna take to make a dream survive?. Who's got the touch to calm the storm inside?. Who's gonna save you?. Alive and Kicking. Stay until your love is, Alive and Kicking. Stay until your love is, until your love is, Alive. Oh you lift me up to the crucial top, so I can see. Oh you lead me on, till the feelings come. And the lights that shine on. But if that don't mean nothing. Like if someday it should fall through. You'll take me home where the magic's from. And I'll be with you. What you gonna do when things go wrong?. What you gonna do when it all cracks up?. What you gonna do when the Love burns down?. What you gonna do when the flames go up?. Who is gonna come and turn the tide?. What's it gonna take to make a dream survive?. Who's got the touch to calm the storm inside?. Don't say goodbye. Don't say goodbye. In the final seconds who's gonna save you?. Oh, Alive and Kicking. Stay until your love is, love is, Alive and Kicking. Oh, Alive and Kicking. Stay until your love is, love is, Alive and Kicking"
travelling man,"The lights of the motel shine on to me. This is the land of the brave, sad and the lonely. The last ride's. Coming to me I can feel it. A new life. Screaming out and I can't miss it. Travelling man. Travelling man. You get away if you can. My body's shaking, my body's tired. Hookers to the left of me, killers on the inside. The last train. Left this station long ago. The headlights. Shine like diamonds in the snow. Like a travelling man. I'm a travelling man. Run away if you can. Cruel world keeps turning I'm dead on my feet. From the blue icy mountains to white city heat. Factory fire burns like a phoenix tonight. Spread your wings come on darling. And your eyes. Search for me but I can't see them. And your sweet mouth. It speaks to me but I can't hear it. And your - your sweet smile. Two thousand miles for your warm kisses. And your sweet child. I got one last chance and I can't miss it. No no no no. Travelling man. Like a travelling man. Well I'm a travelling man. Written by : Kerr/Burchill/Lipson Reproduced Without Permission."
summer,"Here comes summer, here comes rain. Here comes all those mysteries, make me born again. Here comes lightning now, I like the way it shoots. Here comes all those mysteries taking me to my roots. And when the sun rises again. Into the fields I wake up. Into my dreams I descend. Where it's all so real. Here comes summer, here comes rain. Here comes all those energies, making me born again. Here comes lightning, I like the way it shoots. Here comes all those fantasies taking me to my roots. Here comes summer, here comes light. Here comes all those fantasies, taking me through the night. Here comes summer coming, here comes heat. Here comes that strange power taking me to my feet. And when the sun rises again. Into the fields I wake up. With no more dreams I descend. Where it's all so real. Here comes summer, here comes rain. Here comes all those energies, making me born again. Here comes lightning, I like the way it shoots. Here comes all those fantasies taking me to my roots. All those bodies. All those bodies move around. Oh all those bodies everywhere. Here comes summer, here comes rain. Here comes all those energies, making me born again. Here comes lightning now, I like the way it shoots. Here comes all those fantasies taking me to my roots"
someone somewhere in summertime,"Stay, I'm burning slow. With me in the rain, walking in the soft rain. Calling out my name. See me burning slow. Brilliant days, wake up on brilliant days. Shadows of brilliant ways will change all the time. Memories, burning gold memories. Gold of day memories change me in these times. Somewhere there is some place, that one million eyes can't see. And somewhere there is someone, who can see what I can see. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Moments burn, slow burning golden nights. Once more see city lights, holding candles to the flame. Brilliant days, wake up on brilliant days. Shadows of brilliant ways will change me all the time. Somewhere there is some place, that one million eyes can't see. And somewhere there is someone, who can see what I can see. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Words & Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission."
see the lights,Summer's gone winter's in your eyes. I can feel the thunder storms inside. I wake every morning and the cold winds cover me. All I've got's a ghost of what could be. If you can see the lights shine in front of me. If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be. I'm in a broken dream I stare out into space. You know I called you up cos nothing takes your place. I've got a heart of stone and it's sinking deep inside. I want to tell you love I'm too proud to cry. If you can see the lights shine in front of me. If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be. Summer's gone and I can't tell you lies. Oh forgive me love I'm too proud to cry. If you can see the lights shine in front of me. If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be. Summer's gone and I can't tell you lies. Forgive me love I'm too proud to cry. Too proud to cry. Too proud to cry. Too proud to cry. Written by : Kerr/Burchill Reproduced Without Permission.
hunter and the hunted,Shooting from the hip. About our faith and love. I see it in your faces thin as shadow. See me as I figure in your late night plan. See me as I'm cocooned up in Badland. The side effects of cruising at the speed of life. The side effects of living in temptation. When only one star is waiting up on all of us. You'll see me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands. And how do I feel living in the eighties. And do I get to see the light of day. Kyoto in the snow but Heaven's far away. Sending their love - passion parade. Hunter and the Hunted. With me first times can never lie. They were young - they were brave - they were the honest set. The greatest show on earth is here tonight love. See me as a figure in the late night plan. See me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands. The side effects of cruising at the speed of life. The side effects of living in temptation. When only one star is waiting up on all of us. You'll see me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands. And how do I feel living in the eighties. And do I get to see the light of day. Kyoto in the snow. Heaven's far away. Sending their love. Passion parade. Hunter and the Hunted. With me first times can never lie. Only with you. Life moves so fast. When your hear me screaming. I'll be seeing through the eyes of love. Tell me can you hear me. Tell me can you see me. Words & Music : Simple Minds (C) Emi Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission
walk between worlds,"What will you do when there's so much to lose. But you won't pay the price to go on?. And where will you stand when there's no helping hand. Or no road to deter right from wrong. What good can it bring to ignore suffering. To shut out all the reason inside?. From life ordinary to the heights, they get scary. No reason it can't be denied. Oh brother, don't you know. The heart starts beating now?. Brother, can't you see?. There is no reason now. Walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds. When you walk between worlds, we will see. When you walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds. When you walk between worlds, you and me. So what will it bring when there's no offering. There's no music, no dreams, no way out?. No flag to unfold when you walk between worlds. No fear, no wisdom, no doubt. What good can it bring to ignore suffering. To shut out all the rage inside?. From life ordinary to the heights, the get scary. No reason it can't be denied. Oh brother, don't you know. The heart starts beating now?. Brother, can't you see?. There is no reason now. There is no reason now. Walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds. When you walk between worlds, you'll see. When you walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds. When you walk between worlds, you and me. Oh brother, don't you know. The heart starts beating now?"
come a long way,"Swing low, could be the last call for two of us. I said swing high, reach out and touch the sky. But don't cry yet, it's not time yet. See this race is wrong. Come see, this race is right. See millions of years pass with no end in sight. Sleep tight, you couldn't count the cost through the night. 'Cause it's not right, it never was right. Come a long, long. Come a long, long way. Come a long, long. Come a long, long way. Come a long, long. Come a long, long way. Come a long, long. Come a long, long way. Up on May day, and there is a carnival on my street tonight. I hear them dancing, I hear them dancing. But on a clear day. If this thing don't move here. Then this thing just don't have no heartbeat. Get on the street, I say. Sweet hours to live, I got no time to kill. I said hold back those arms raised hold back the bill. Sleep tight, you couldn't count the cost through the night. 'Cause it's not right, it never was right. Come a long, long. Come a long, long way. Come a long, long. Come a long, long way. Come a long, long. Come a long, long way. Come a long, long.

20th century promised land,Stories came like the wind. Joining every bridge in the wind. Ringing out footsteps. Calling out stell-heels. I give voice. I give breath. Count out evenings and stars. How fast can these things move on. Taking roots back to yourself. And the reason for fear was moving on. And on. Some time. Great times. Troubled time. Fire for the times. Ringing out footsteps. Calling out steel-heels. Promised land. Great times in commotion. Here come every day. It only lasts an hour. Unhappy the land that has no heroes. No! Unhappy the land that needs heroes. And the reason for fear was moving on. The speed of light was moving on. Don't cry. Tears are only wasted waters. Some say God her only loves the proud. Be damned on luck. But not dishearted. Nothing to prove. And nothing to present. I give voice. I give breath. Catching winds in my hand. My hand. Some times. Great times. Catching wind in my hand. My hand. Some times. Great times. Troubled times. Fire for the times. Ringing out footsteps. Calling out steel-heels. Promised land. Great times in commotion. Here comes every dat. It only lasts an hour. Unhappy the land that has no heroes. No! Unhappy the land that needs heroes. I'll call you out. I'll scream you out. And I don't care if you're afraid. When city sounds invade the air. Catch the wind in their hands. Promised land. Catch the wind in their hands. Promised lands. Promised lands. Promised lands. Great times in commotion.

30 frames a second,"Today I saw a film going backwards. Thirty Frames A Second. Was a man I recognised. Say who you are. I lost my job. Security. Self confidence. Bank account. Identity. The league of youth. Coming backward at me. Thirty Frames a second. Say who you are. Go back to father. Father where's my food?. You food is on the table. That can't be food. It's dirt. Say who you are. Look at my skin. Look at my face. Look at my arms. Getting younger. Going backwards. Thirty Frames A Second. Say who you are. I crash my car. Collapse in town. Young immigrants. And legionaires. Fighting back back backwards. Thirty Frames A Second. Say who you are. Some friends of mine. I thought were dead. A coming back. ""What are you doing coming back. Jack"". Say who you are. Feel I'm going backwards. Thirty Frames A Second."
7 deadly sins,"Ever felt that you've been lied. And somehow you just can't provide the proof. Ever felt you're cast aside. And sheltered from the universal truth. Ever find when trouble calls you're first in line. And stick your finger in. Everybody's talking 'bout 7 deadly sins. Number one says drop the gun. There's nothing out there that's worth dying for. And number two that's me and you. I'm green inside and jealous to the core. Number three fidelity I've lost the path. And I'd better start again. This thing's got a strange mystique. The 7 deadly sins. This thing's got the whole world beat. 7 deadly sins. I can hear them calling out. I can hear them screaming out. Blood is sweet like a deep red river. And where it goes I don't know. You make me sweat. And you make me shiver. Where it goes I don't know. If you've got sticky fingers. You got dreams that linger running through your brain. Well vanity's the flying ""V"". Desire is the one who gets the blame. If you're looking for a goldmine. When all around you seems be tin. I'm not superstitious 'bout the 7 deadly sins. Everybody's calling out 7 deadly sins. Everybody's dreamin' 'bout 7 deadly sins. Written by : Kerr/Burchill Reproduced Without Permission."
a life shot in black & white,"A life shot in black and white. lays me down, takes me there. where words still fail me, yeah.. A life shot in black and white. shames me now since it takes us. there where nothing can break this.. I’m still toiling back and yet I am still ashen,. I keep falling back ’cause I believe it matters.. Slamming on the brakes and like a haunted child. I was born to break.. A life shot in black and white. throws me down, then raises me. with colours still bleeding, yeah.. It’s all there in black and white,. I’ve seen it now, I’ve seen it there. and the moment’s not leaving.. A life shot in black and white. stares me down, take me where,. and like doves we’ll not leave never,. we’re still here in black and white.. Changes now, changes here,. but the spirit’s not leaving."

all for you,I had a walk the other day. To meet someone I think you know. The air was cold. Skies were so grey. Somebody lay on the ground below. All For You. All For You. All For You. Came face to face. Felt so uneasy. Oh so confused as what's going on. Just could not move. Feel so affaid. Whisper the words. The words were said. All For You. All For You. All For You. Into the street. People can meet. Don't turn your back to the view. The silver blade can cut up your throat. I tell you now. 'Cause I know it's true. All For You. All For You. All For You. I had to walk the other day. To meet someone. All For You. Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Burchill/Kerr (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission.
all the things she said,"Don't you look back on a big lost world. Crying out tomorrow. Don't you look down like the heroes say. Come tell me all about it. Take me to the streets where the bonfires burn. Take me in your arms and I'll fade away. When I hear you say what you got to say. Anywhere you go, you know I'll still be waiting. All the things she said, she said. Little darling close your eyes, there'll be no compromising. Of all the things she said, she said. Throw me to the street where the heartbeats beating. ""Beating all around me"". To the peaceful revolution. And the perfect wave, surround me. Tell me 'bout the ocean moving in slow motion. I see it glitter in the sun. Then it's freezing in the moonlight. Never look back, never look back, never look away. If freedom comes and goes, you know I'll still be waiting. All the things she said, she said. You've fought the fight so long, no surrender to temptation. Of all the things she said, she said. Stars will fall out for you. Luck will surrender. I'm calling out to you. Oh to be near you in the first morning light. I'd be with you, I dream about you. If I could leave here, I would leave here tonight. I'd be with you, I'd stay with you tonight. Tonight. Anywhere you go, you know I'll still be waiting. Of all the things she said, she said. When I look into your eyes, I see a new day rising. Of all the things she said, she said. Through the eyes of love, and to never know what hate is. Of all the things she said, she said. She said, this is our time, she said, this is our place. This is the space my heart wants to be. Little darling close your eyes, there'll be no compromising. All the things she said, she said."

and the band played on,"Sweetest angel came down. Took me by the hand. Said I've got things to offer you. Help you understand. If the bombs don't get you. I'll roll with you tonight. All these things inside your head. You've got to get it right. And the band played on. Spirits of the city. Were calling out my name. When jealous guys break down and cry. They got themselves to blame. If the bombs don't get you. Take courage in the night. All those dreams inside your head. You've got to get it right. Still the band played on. And the band played on. The room was getting hotter. And someone hit the light. There was power in the darkness. There was violence in the night. And the golden sons and daughters. They were coming up for air. You were standing with your back to me. And a halo round your hair. And the questions there were many. Like how can you survive. When it's the moment. You've been waiting for. This is the moment of your life. So every dreamer pass me by. With a fix me Jesus stare in his eyes. I was born to live. I was born to die. With the queen of soul. And the king of light. All the power in the land. Pull me through to the shadowland. I was driven by some hidden hand. It's the greatest gift of all. And the band played on. Shake the ghost within you. Get up, meet up, the rising sun. Cos the old days they're the dying days. And the new day's just begun. At the end of every party. Hear the singer sing his song. May his heart stay young forever. And the dream still lingers on. I want to die. I want to live again. I want to keep on keeping on. They say a coward dies a thousand times. But the brave they die just once. So walk to me, talk to me. Hold me now spectre of love. There's a coolness under fire. And a universal love. And the band played on. Played on, played on.

angel underneath my skin,"It kept me up much too late. Kept me up for three days. Left me in a storm at sea. Invisible to eyesight. Surrounded me in spotlight. Been moving around for three whole years. Said: Hey you're too exposed. Enemies are getting close. They'll be round to take you away. So tell your soul to sing. And sing along with anything. It might be much too late. There's an angel underneath my skin. Wake me up and teach my soul to sing. I think I found a reason. I want to start believing. 'Cause somebody alive's up here. Those superstitious evils. Can stay with other people. Me? I don't have too much fear. I've got my whole life coming on. I've got my whole life coming on. I've got my whole life. There's an angel underneath my skin. Wake me up and teach my soul to sing. There's an angel underneath my skin. Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up"
banging on the door,You know that it hurts. These things that you say. But I'll be alright. Don't lose your faith. Just swallow your pride tonight. God only knows this place is strange. Banging on the door again. Banging on the door that's locked forever. Losing on a lover's game. Winning on the one side and losing forever. The air that we breather hangs heavy tonight. Still I look for your face. I'm home all alone again. Some dreams grow old and then they just die. I'm banging on the door again. Still banging on the door that's locked forever. Losing on a lover's game. Winning on the one track and hurting forever. Oh your love is a symphony. All this love over all of me. Oh your love is a symphony. Oh sweet love I can feel it. Still banging on the door again. I'm banging on the door that's sealed forever. Losing on a lover's game. Winning on the one track hurting forever.

barrowland star,"Did we think those days would last forever?. And there, across the bridge, under the bold neon stars. We'd sacrifice ourselves for something better. Let's think about, let's think about it. You and me. No mistakes, no, no other way. I could feel the fever, hour coming nearer. Put our jackets on, the bad days were gone. The night was coming on to be Barrowland Stars. Trauma in our head was let go instead. And all we ever wanted was there to touch. All around us said: You'll be Barrowland Stars. Did we think those would last forever?. Those broken circle one more time come together. Let's think about it, let's think about it. Let's think about it. You and me, you and me. Feel the fever, Barrowland Stars. Creeping nearer, Barrowland Stars. Blood was rushing, we were Barrowland Stars. Was no mistake, was no, no other way. I could feel the fever, hour coming nearer. Put our jackets on, the bad days were gone. The night was coming on to be Barrowland Stars. Trauma in our head was let go instead. And all we ever wanted was there to touch.

belfast child,"When my love said to me. Meet me down by the gallow tree. For it's sad news I bring. About this old town and all that it's offering. Some say troubles abound. Some day soon they're gonna pull the old town down. One day we'll return here,. When the Belfast Child sings again. Brothers sisters where are you now. As I look for you right through the crowd. All my life here I've spent. With my faith in God the Church and the Government. But there's sadness abound. Some day soon they're gonna pull the old town down. One day we'll return here,. When the Belfast Child sings again. When the Belfast Child sings again. Some come back Billy, won't you come on home. Come back Mary, you've been away so long. The streets are empty, and your mother's gone. The girls are crying, it's been oh so long. And your father's calling, come on home. Won't you come on home, won't you come on home. ome back people, you've been gone a while. And the war is raging, in the Emerald Isle. That's flesh and blood man, that's flesh and blood. All the girls are crying but all's not lost. The streets are empty, the streets are cold. Won't you come on home, won't you come on home. The streets are empty. Life goes on. One day we'll return here. When the Belfast Child sings again. When the Belfast Child sings again. Music : Traditional Arrangement : Simple Minds Words : Simple Minds Reproduced without permission."

Drifting in wildlife. And still you're wandering now. We were on the top and the world was spinning. We were only young in the whirlpool of warning. Communication lost in the thundering rain style. Shelter from the storm in the early beginning. Going out in the big sleep, out in the big sleep. Could have been years, you know it could have been years. Or only seconds ago. Big sleep, where are you now?. Now that you're in big sleep. Valuable friend. They saw you leaving this way. We were on the top and the world was spinning. We were only young in the whirlpool of warning. Communication lost in the thundering rain style. Shelter from the storm in the early beginning. Where did you go?.

broken glass park,"At summertime we go down to broken glass park. We'd sit on down until light fades through to dark. Do you remember me?. Everytime we go down to broken glass park. We'd sit on down 'til day turned into dark. Do you remember me?. It was the last day of the last great century. We were so young in my memory. And broken glass park. Head for the sun. Stay out all night. 'Til morning had come. Tune in to ourselves. Get lost here for days. Turned in to time. Still frozen in space. In broken glass park. Let's head for the sun. Stayed out all night.

'Til morning had come. Tune in to ourselves. Get lost here for days. Frozen in time. May those moments rest in here with me. And it will always be. One day longer the sense gets stronger. And I know it will be, this is our destiny. And broken glass park. Head for the sun. Stay out all night. 'Til morning had come. Tune in to ourselves. Get lost here for days. Turned in to time. Still frozen in space. In broken glass park. Let's head for the sun. Stayed out all night. 'Til morning had come. Tune in to ourselves. Get lost here for days. Frozen in time.

Well I don't care there's no-one there. That even turn around and say get out of this place. Last night I saw a shooting star. When morning comes. She hides away. A real disgrace.

criminal world,"I look for the answer. I look for the light. I walk on every highway. Still I need you tonight. So let it be love. Lonely love. Let it be love. It's a criminal world. It hits like a bullet. It screams and it hurts. Is it my fascination. Or does love come inspired. Don't hand me down, don't push me down. Don't leave me lying on the frozen ground. You can shelter me with your sweet action. This world is splitting up and it's a chain reaction. It's a criminal world. You move like a vampire. Risen from dust. Is it my fascination. Don't hand me down, don't push me down. Don't leave me lying on the frozen ground. You can shelter me with your sweet action. This world is splitting up and it's a chain reaction. And when you point me to another place. I can turn my back upon this wilderness. And I'll step inside. Step inside. And find you waiting on the other side. It's a criminal world.

destiny,Look at the world outside. Beware its evil tide. Too many endless days. Cold streets and alleyways. The poor come crawling out. They speak but never shout. I think you'd rather be alone. You're hiding in a shell. So easy I can tell. Can you sell me some thoughts. Though drugs just can't be bought. Tell me is it some crime. To wait a long time. I think you'd rather be alone. Can you hear me. Can you see. I don't want this destiny. To be destined. Destiny. Something's been happening here. Don't touch. Don't come so near. Don't ask me to reply. Can't think of no more lies. The hand thate reaches out. Can crush without a doubt. I think you'd rather be alone. Oh much is left unexplained. It's getting to my brain. Yet still you wear that smile. Then walk your crooked mile. Some day you're bound to learn. Too late. There's no return. I think you'd rather be alone. Can you hear me. Can you see. I don't want this destiny. To be destined.

garden of hate,Oh I only had enough of you. Oh I did not ask for nothing else. But you've gone and found a one-way out. I stand here by myself. Oh I see a man he's got a broken arm. I don't know if I care. Follow him into the garden of hate. Everybody's going to be there. It's been some time since I last saw you. Can somebody here please tell me why. So many things I just don't understand. No matter how I try. A girl I know got quite cut up one night. I don't know if I care. She was in my garden of hate. So many others are there. Garden of hate. Ha Haha garden of hate. Garden of hate. Ha haha garden of hate. Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Burchill/Kerr (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission.
ghostdancing,"Cities, buildings falling down. Satellites come crashing down. I see them falling out the skies like eagles. All mirrored glass and shattered egos. But in a corner of the world we'd meet to laugh and drink and plan our sequels. 'Cause in the alleyways and bars downtown. They're singing up from here to there can we go. This city comes alive at night, see these city walls are heaving. And if these old city walls should crash, amid the rubble you'd find us breathing. Come say what you see in me. 'Cause boy, I believe in you. Come say what you're seeing. All gone just ghost dancing, going all the way through. You talk about the Lebanon. You tell me 'bout the Dawn in Eden. You talk about South Africa. I tell you about the Irish children. You say one more Polish Knight could come and blow away the doors to Freedom. And if Mother Ethiopia could blow away the tears that we see run. O blow them away,. Blow, blow away. We Will blow them away. O blow, blow away. Blow, blow away. Blow, blow away. Come say what you see in me. 'Cause boy, I believe in you. Come say what you're seeing. They're all gone just ghost dancing, going all the way through. You know I believe in you. Oh yes I believe, you know I believe in you. You say you believe. I believe, I believe, going all the way through, yeah. Come take me back home, come on and take me away. Ghost Dancing. The car pulled up, the girl she jumped in. The boy he wore a medal that was shining from his skin. With the windows pulled up, their radio tuned in. She's hitting from the stars, he's hitting for the moon. She said, one last kiss while you look across the Land. Move it into overdrive and take me by my hand. When the car broke, the rebels saw smoke. and they all went to heaven in a stupid fantasy, go. Take me away. Words And Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Music (Publ) Ltd Reproduced without permission."
ghostrider,Shadows in your room. Like a ghost you never see. Look in to the one you love if you're afraid of me. Ghettos in his eyes. He plays a torch song melody. Listen to the one you love if you're afraid of me. Ghost rider. E S P. Paperback rider. You can't fool me. When all is said and done. Babylon was meant to be. Shitting on the one you love if you're afraid of me. He's got the wild dog in his eyes. He's got a speedball in his brain. Running through the roads of love like a marathon man. Ghost rider. E S P. The devil inside her. Don't want it to be. Yeah the ghost rider. E S P. A paperback rider. Deep down in his soul. Every little boy knows. The he can't stop running so go. Look out. There's been a shoot out for love. I've got the shivers of love. Ghost rider. E S P. The devil inside her. I don't want it to be. Ghost rider. E S P. She's got the devil inside her. Oh no you can't. You can't fool me. Oh no you can't. You can't fool me. Oh no you can't. Yeah the ghost rider. E S P. Oh paperback rider. Oh no you can't fool. Oh no you can't fool.

glitterball,"Full of doubt, took the easy way out. Always said they couldn't find their place. Among some real dark stuff, they got to thinking enough. Remember Halcyon Days. We'll spend our time with a bottle of wine. And a love that knows no human state. Never got to wake up early. Never got to feel so poorly. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. Glitterball - Radiate round the hall. Lifts me up - Then leaves me to fall. Glitterball - Radiate round the hall. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. One step, Two step, Three step, Four. Drag me to the middle, then you pulled me to the floor. Glitterball - Radiate round the hall. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. And I've been captured by imagination. I feel the faint vibration in the air. Been taken hostage by the one creation. Anticipate the night that's in your hair. Glitterball - Radiate round the hall. Lifts me up - Then leaves me to fall. Glitterball - Radiate round the hall. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. Glitterball - Radiate round the hall. Lifts me up - Then leaves me to fall. Glitterball - Radiate round the hall. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. One step, Two step, Three step, Four. Drag me to the middle, then you pulled me to the floor. Glitterball - Radiate round the hall. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. One final day. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. Don't make me wait. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. Don't make me wait. As the great unloved go dancing all the way. Written by : Kerr/Burchill Reproduced Without Permission."
glittering prize,"Shine On, Shine the Light on me,. In all of my Life so that much more I see. In the Light of his Love. In the Light of reflection. Oh what a world. Or sometimes oh so it seems. Eyes in the skies. In that silver gift friendship. A Glittering Prize. Is it the prize of lost loves. They can remember quiet sides of midnight. They can remember the attraction of fame. Like a Glittering Prize. I saw up on a clear day. First taking hearts. Then our last breath away. Always came a time - time was on our side. We were spending time - we were staring out. Catch me in a dream - Captured all in heart. We were spending time - we were staring out. Could there ever be - ever more than one. It's called an act of Love. Can you you never stop?. Shine On, Shine the Light on me,. In all of my Life. So much more I see. Like a Glittering Prize. I saw you up on a clear day. First taking heart then our last breath away. Only on a clear day coming into our lives. See it in the eye - satellite skies. We were spending time - we were staring out. Take in, Take in more - The Endless breath away. We were spending time - we were staring out. Could there ever be - ever more than one. It's called an act of Love. Can you you never stop?. Always on a clear day. Crashing into our lives. Is it the Price of Love. Like a Glittering Prize. Always on a clear day. Crashing into our lives. With your love. Only on a clear day.

grafitti soul,"You bring me lightening!. Footsteps walking in again.. Name checks begin again.. Stand here let's soak it in again.. The white lines and the inner pain.. When I’m sorting out the wars,. And breaking out the holes,. That lead to me to the scars,. Things written on the wall,. There’s nothing I would change in my graffiti soul.. You bring me lightening!. Footsteps walking in again.. The white lines stencilled in again.. And when I'm sorting out the wars,. And breaking out the holes,. That lead me to the scars they’ve written on the wall.. There’s nothing I’d change in my graffiti soul.. And when I am rushing in my head,. Yet cruising in control,. Admiring the spread beyond the neon sprawl,. There’s nothing I’d change in my graffiti soul.. You bring me lightening!. And when I’m sorting out the wars,. And breaking out the holes,. That lead me to the scars they’ve written on the wall,. There’s nothing I’d change in my graffiti soul.. And when I am rushing in my head,. Yet cruising in control,. Admiring the spread beyond the neon sprawl,. There’s nothing I’d change in my graffiti soul.. You bring me lightening!"
great leap forward,"I jumped up like Apollo. Crash landed on my feet. The sun shot like a laser through my brain. A little death had woken up. And put a curse on me. But I knew that that I'd be coming back again. Inspiration, across the nation. There's a poverty of expectation. All I got to do was move ahead. It's a blue sky. It's a while cloud. It's a flame. It's a blue sky. White cloud. Burning flame. I shot back to the mirror. There was nothing left to see. But a phantom with his heartbeat deep inside. I could feel the dust of ages. They were blowing back at me. But I knew that I was born to get it right. Everybody take the great leap forward. Everybody knows the mysteries at hand. If you've been praying all those sweet days for this. Don't you know there is a whole different plan. Sometimes I hear the madman calling. He talks about some dark eternal place. I've been waiting all my lifetime for this moment. And now I've got to find some other ways. One touch ignites this eagle. One kiss for heavens view. I need the flame so I can feel alive. You can tell my little brother. No requiem for me. I knew that I was born to make this flight. Inspiration across the nation. There's a poverty of expectation. All I got to do was move ahead.

home,"Home. God gave me travelling shoes,. God gave me the wanderer’s eye,. God gave two gold coins to help me to the other side.. He then turned around and said - be careful how the small things grow,. When God gives you travelling shoes,. You know that it is time to go.. Home,. Home,. Home.. He then sent in the ship at night,. And it took me to a hidden port.. Slipped me the key at last,. To open up my prison door.. Gave me blackbird's wings,. Gifted me with beggar's eyes.. But when God sends in the jackals,. You know that it is time to say bye, bye, bye.. So I’m going home.. Home,. Home,. Home,. Home,. Home.. So God gave me travelling shoes,. Gave me one last reprieve.. He then gave me hunger,. Denying me the air to breath.. Not even one small case,. Not even one last goodbye.. But God gave me travelling shoes,. And without them I would surely die,. So I’m going home.. Home,. Home,. Home,. Home"
homosapien,I'm the shy boy. You're the coy boy. And you know we're. Homosapien too. I'm the cruiser. You're the loser. Me and you sir. Homosapien too. Homosuperior. In my interior. But from the skin out. I'm Homosapien too. And you're Homosapien too. And we're Homosapiens too. And you're Homosapien too. And the world filled with age are a stage where we act out our lies. And the words in the script seem to fit 'cept we have some surprise. I just want this to last all our dreams dreaming past are all gone. And if this is the case then I'm losing trace from now on. I'm a shy boy. You're a coy boy. And you know we're. Homosapien too. I'm the cruiser. You're the loser. Me and you sir. Homosapien too. Homosuperior. In my interior. But from the skin out. I'm Homosapien too. And you're Homosapien too. And we're Homosapiens too. And you're Homosapien too. And I think of your eyes in the dark and I see the star. When I look to the light and I might wonder right where you are. All the gods in the sky way up high see the earth spinning 'round. But the sun and the moon and the stars are so far from the ground. I'm the cruiser. You're the loser. Homosuperior. In my interior. Yeah I'm the cruiser. You're the loser. I'm the shy boy. You're the coy boy. Yeah I'm a shy boy. I'm a shy boy. Well I'm a shy boy. I'm a shy boy. Shy boy.... Shy boy...
hunter and the hunted,Shooting from the hip. About our faith and love. I see it in your faces thin as shadow. See me as I figure in your late night plan. See me as I'm cocooned up in Badland. The side effects of cruising at the speed of life. The side effects of living in temptation. When only one star is waiting up on all of us. You'll see me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands. And how do I feel living in the eighties. And do I get to see the light of day. Kyoto in the snow but Heaven's far away. Sending their love - passion parade. Hunter and the Hunted. With me first times can never lie. They were young - they were brave - they were the honest set. The greatest show on earth is here tonight love. See me as a figure in the late night plan. See me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands. The side effects of cruising at the speed of life. The side effects of living in temptation. When only one star is waiting up on all of us. You'll see me as I'm cocooned up in Badlands. And how do I feel living in the eighties. And do I get to see the light of day. Kyoto in the snow. Heaven's far away. Sending their love. Passion parade. Hunter and the Hunted. With me first times can never lie. Only with you. Life moves so fast. When your hear me screaming. I'll be seeing through the eyes of love. Tell me can you hear me. Tell me can you see me. Words & Music : Simple Minds (C) Emi Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission

i travel,"Cities, buildings falling down. Ideal homes falling down. These pictures I see on the wall. Timeless leaders stand so tall. Assassin in a hit and run. Asia steals a new born son. Evacuees and refugees. Presidents and monarchies. Travel round. I travel round. Decadence and pleasure towns. Tragedies,luxuries,statues,parks and galleries. Europe has a language problem. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talking on. In central Europe. Men are marching. Marching on and marching on. Love songs playing in the restaurants. Airport playing ""Bi Some Lo"". Travel round. I travel round. Decadence and pleasure towns. Tragedies,luxuries,statues,parks and galleries. Europe has a language problem. Europe has a language problem. America has a language problem. I Travel.

i wish you were here,"Footsteps, I can hear footsteps in the hall. I hear footsteps, seems like I've been through this before. Some time has come now, some time has passed. But things still look the same. Is heaven all above, and paradise below. And the questions still remain. Ooh, can we see you?. Ooh, are we near you?. How could you disappear out of here?. I wish for something, I wish you were here. Footsteps, I can hear footsteps in the hall. I hear footsteps, it seems like I've been through this before. Well we loved you then, I guess we always will. We love you still from here. Birds of a feather always stay together. And never separate, no fear. Ooh, can we see you?. Ooh, are we near you?. How could you disappear out of here?. I wish for something, I wish for something. I wish you were here, I wish you were here. I wish you well. Footsteps, I can hear footsteps in the hall. I hear footsteps, seems like I've been through this before. If all the world was turning blue and gold. Like through your eyes so clear. The time has come to celebrate our past. And crystalize this sphere. Ooh, can we see you?. Ooh, are we near you?. How can you disappear out of here?. I wish for something. Ooh, can we see you?. Ooh, are we near you?. How can you disappear out of here?. I wish for something. I wish you were here, I wish you were here. I wish you well. There will come a day. Oh some day our day will come. Our day will come, our day will come. Words And Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Music (Publ) Ltd Reproduced without permission."
if i had wings,Open inside something about this pain. There's something about this sweet refrain. Reminds me that you're not there. And if I could care there's something about this curse. Like a needle inside a silken purse. Reminds me of all that you'd bring. If I had wings. I'm still standing. Blue mountain high. Only the fables get to fly. Without these words there's no reason why. It reminds me of all that you bring. If I had wings. Would like to teach myself. If I had wings. Would learn to stir myself. If I had wings. Strapped inside won't be denied. Nightmare brings. All that you said. And if I could fly. Long time saviour. That's the sinner's crime. Well without such trust. I know that I can never find. Never find - Never find - Never find. If I had wings. If I had wings. I'm still standing. Never find - Never find - Never find. Open inside something about this pain. There's something about this sweet refrain. Reminds me that you're not there. And if I could care there's something about this curse. Like a needle inside a silken purse. Reminds me of all that you'd bring. If I had wings. If I had wings. If I had wings. If I had wings.

jeweller part 2,"It’s a long cold distance through the galaxies.. If my eyes were open wide maybe I could see.. If a burned out future seems like all that’s in store. I’d tumble to the ground like a fading meteor.. Jeweller to the stars, Jeweller to the stars,. Jeweller to the stars, that’s who you are.. That’s who you are.. Ever been out walking where the air gets thin,. or stranded on a planet losing out on oxygen?. Scream out “listen” in a silent place,. feel that you’re falling, calling into space.. Jeweller to the stars, Jeweller to the stars,. Jeweller to the stars, that’s who you are.. that’s who you are.. that’s who you are.. It’s a long cold distance through the galaxies.. My eyes were open wide, oh desolately.. If a burned out future seems like all that’s in store. I’d tumble to the ground like a fading meteor.. Jeweller to the stars, Jeweller to the stars,. Jeweller to the stars, that’s who you are.. that’s who you are."
kaleidoscope,See. What so you see. Tell us the things. That circulate round you. Scars. Deep as an ocean. I've got some things. I'd like to show you. Friends of mine. Who ask to stay. Well you can turn around. And walk. All things lie in hope. Focusing through. Your human kaleidoscope. One man has a dream. Tells it to me. And I call it fiction. Friends of mine. Who ask to stay. Well they can turn around. And walk. Walk walk. Walk away. . Chimes. Rhythms to me. Someone else waits. Behind the curtain. Image. Leave them to me. Destructive virgin. Behind the curtain. Friends of mine. Who ask to stay. You can turn around and. Walk walk walk. Walk walk walk away. Walk walk. Walk away. Walk walk. Walk away. Walk. Walk away. Walk walk away. Away away away.

kick it in,"Love gives me poetry. Stays up all night and puts a curse on me. Oh anything you want. Turn around and I'll take you there. I know it's going to be. Take your shackles off o' me. This city's gone, I'm gone over there. Kick it in, kick it in. Build it up and burn it down again. Kick it in, kick it in. Burn down to the ground. Kick it in, kick it in. Tell me about this place you've been. I don't want it there's a fever going around. Take a walk down town. See what's going on. If you want to find a hidden key. There's nothing here on me. Any city, anywhere. Any colour I don't care. You belong to me. And that's the way it's gonna be. Kick it in, kick it in. Yeah kick it in, kick it in. Raise it up and let it live again. Feel your body shake and take off. You can lie but keep it in. Keep me down here wondering. So what's it going to be. Come on in. I like the shape you're in. You keep me wondering, wondering, wondering. Eyes upon you black and brown. Spread your love all over town. Give me fire, body heat. Say hello to me. I want to go anywhere. Any colour I don't care. Don't believe in all you see. And don't get caught. Kick it in, kick it in. Tell me about this love you've been. Kick it in, kick it in. Turn this life around. Kick it in, kick it in. Shake the ghosts from deep within. Close the door down. Don't let the demons in. Kick it in, kick it in. I only want to be your friend. Put your hands in my hand. And take off with me. Listen baby, I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. Come on walk with me. Cause I know what I see. Kick it in. Kick it in, kick it in. Tell me 'bout the place you're in.

killing andy warhol,"Did you ever see the sun rise up. Above this blackened hole. Did you ever feel that what you want's. Not under your control. Ever think that how you feel. Is not quite what you are. Some of us are satellites. Some are superstars. They're killing Andy Warhol. He's a saint and he's a thief. We'll all die a million times. That's what I believe. Killing Andy Warhol. Killing Andy Warhol. They say the rain in Europe. Cools you down and helps you think. Water, water everywhere. Nothing you can drink. Kissing Andy Warhol. His skin feels like a shark. White hair sits so beautiful. Eyelids are so dark. And I'm trying to get ahead. Like any boy or girl. There'd be no dictators anywhere. If I could rule the world. Killing Andy Warhol. Killing Andy warhol. That's impossible - he got all that money. Adorable - having all that money. Feasable - that it's all black money. It's so criminal - making all that money. All I want, is what I'd want. But I don't want that now. They're dressing Andy Warhol up. If only thay knew how. Jesus on the neon sign. Turns and starts to laugh. And I'm thinking about this oxygen. And how I'll make it last. Killing Andy Warhol. He's a saint - yeah he's a thief. Motorways are everywhere. With no clean air to breathe. Killing Andy Warhol. Killing Andy Warhol. Till the end of time. Till the end of time. Having all that money. Killing Andy Warhol. He's got all that money. And it's real black money. Making all that money. Killing Andy Warhol.

king is white and in the crowd,"Talking by the pool of light, language from America.. She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd. They are not a melting pot, say no, say no tapestry. She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd. She takes his hand and she says you'll stay. She's lost in the crowd. King. Wire them up, fire them up. The life and times, the art and talk. Wire them up, fire them up. The life and times, the art and talk. Lovers run camp Africa, Bars in town are civilised. She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd. Panorama, Citylife. Youth's dance proud from the waist down. She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd. Shot from where the action is, a rhapsody in black and blue. She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd. Love lies under western eyes, powerful yet transient.

kiss and fly,"Was my imagination, or they told me it was there?. But I could see.. Within that situation everything’s a cross to bear.. I feel.. Some are in a coma,. Some are without sight.. You can feel the transformation in their bodies in the night.. Gone translucent, encircled in light. So bring back the lover’s chains.. No letters need reply.. Move over what remains.. Let us go kiss and fly.. Was only one solution that was in my head,. That I could see.. Spiritual confusion so more than I could stand,. I could feel.. Like someone in a coma,. Someone without sight.. Feel it in my body, feel it every night.. Gone translucent, encirled in light.. So bring back the lovers chains.. No need letters need reply.. Move over what remains.. And let us go kiss and fly.. Bring back the lovers arms,. Oh let me go deep inside.. Cool over all remains,. And let us go kiss and fly.. Kiss and fly,. kiss and fly.. I don’t think there’s much to tell you.. I don’t think there’s much to say.. I don’t think there’s much to tell you.. I know that you know so much more."
kiss the ground,"I’m in a golden temple,. in a bombed out street,. feel the rough and tumble. down where the borders meet.. I hear a sandstorm falling. down where the tears have dried. and there’s a west wind calling,. but I get no reply.. And I kiss the ground,. I kiss the ground,. nothing around.. There is no hidden karma,. there is no sacred plight,. there is no special armour. to take me through the night.. I kiss the ground,. I kiss the ground,. nothing around,. I kiss the ground.. I kiss the ground,. nothing around.. Into the space between us,. into the words that say. that every law demeans us. then every price you pay.. There is no hidden karma,. there is no sacred plight,. there is no special armour. to take me through the night.. I kiss the ground,. I kiss the ground,. nothing around,. I kiss the ground.. I kiss the ground,. I kiss the ground,. nothing around,. I kiss the ground.. There is no manna-mania,. there is no banquet here,. there is only ghettoes.. I kiss the ground."
lazy lately,"Made them a play. Laid by the sea. A lifetime of promises. Translated to me. It's been hard, hard, hard. It's been so hard. Easy to place easy to fake. When I don't know about. You know you'll be strong. Shes far too young. If you got something to say. It's easy to know. That you'll find me awake. Leave me alone. Heat of a gun. Leads me to know, you've been. Lazy lately, lazily. Lazy lately, lazily. Laid by the plain. Raised by the sea. Feels like a hologram, a halo over me. It's been high, high high. Getting oh so high. Raised by love. Faced by the sea. A scene all alone. So I know why you come. It's been high, high. Getting oh so high. If you got something to say. It's easy to know that. You'll find me awake. Leave me alone. The heat of a gun. Leads me to know, you've been. Lazy lately, lazily. If you got something to say. See me alone. You can find me awake. Leave me alone. The heat of a gun. Leads me to know, you've been.

let it all come down,"So let it all come, let it all come down. Let it all come, let it all come down. Sweet tears roll like a river from your eyes. Get close let's sleep tonight. When you wake there's a new day dawning. When you wake there's a cold wind blowing. When day breaks there's a light shines through. I'm still here with you when the morning comes. I need you with me when the day begins. Oh let it all come, let it all come down. Why don't you let it all come, let it all come down. All is in control, love is on the open road. Make me want to live, you make me want to die. When you wake there's a new day dawning. When you wake there's a cold wind blowing. When day breaks there's a light shining through. Oh let it all come, let it all come down. Written by John Giblin and Simple Minds Reproduced without permission."

let there be love,"Secrets of lovers. Whisper tonight. Broken down angel. Got lost in the cold daylight. The city is screaming. And I look for your eyes. Someone to lean on through the night. Your music talks to me and hits me tonight. One candle burning, I hear your voice say. So let there be love. Let there be love. Love. Let there be love. It heals and it hurts. She leads you to heaven's door. And leaves you for dirt. Someone to lean on, that's your own. Some magic conquers me and lives in my soul,. She comes like an ocean and I hear you sing. Love will conquer anything. So let it be love. Let it be love. Love. Let it be love. The wall's down. They're coming down. I can't slow. I know it now. So stay now. Hold on. And I'm praying.

life in a day,Life In A Day. The price that you pay. For time that you spent. It's such a fatal event. Take a look at your watch. There is no time to wait. Take a look deep inside. There's no escape from this day. Life In A Day. Life In A Day. Take a look around you. Is it true what they say. Life In A Day. Life In A Day. Is there no place to hide. Could there be some other way. Can you see how they run. Do you believe what they say. They'll soon be looking for you. For sure they'll get you away. The premonition came true. Look all around and you'll see. Some say it takes two to know. Or could it all just be me. Life In A Day. Life In A Day. I love to see how they run. They came a running this way. Life In A Day. Life In A Day. No sence in looking for you. They're going to get you one day. Life In A Day. Life In A Day.

love will tear us apart,"When routine bites hard, and ambitions are low And. resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow And. we're changing our ways, taking different roads. Then love, love will tear us apart again. Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on. your side Is my timing that flawed - our respect. run so dry? Yet there's still this appeal that. we've kept through our lives Love, love will tear. us apart again. You cry out in your sleep - all my failings expose. There's a taste in my mouth, as desperation takes. hold Just that something so good just can't. function no more"
mandela day,It was 25 years they take that man away. Now the freedom moves in closer every day. Wipe the tears down from your saddened eyes. They say Mandela's free so step outside. Oh oh oh oh Mandela day. Oh oh oh oh Mandela's free. It was 25 years ago this very day. Held behind four walls all through night and day. Still the children know the story of that man. And I know what's going on right through your land. 25 years ago. Na na na na Mandela day. Oh oh oh Mandela's free. If the tears are flowing wipe them from your face. I can feel his heartbeat moving deep inside. It was 25 years they took that man away. And now the world come down say Nelson Mandela's free. Oh oh oh oh Mandela's free. The rising suns sets Mandela on his way. Its been 25 years around this very day. From the one outside to the ones inside we say. Oh oh oh oh Mandela's free. Oh oh oh set Mandela free. Na na na na Mandela day. Na na na na Mandela's free. 25 years ago. What's going on. And we know what's going on. Cos we know what's going on.
moscow underground,"Descended from a world of darkened places,. Descended from a world that’s lost control,. Suspended between time and fractured places,. I’m waiting for the fall here on my own.. Please take me down where the rain drops,. Please take me down, down below.. Please hold me here where the dreams stop,. Please leave me here on my own.. It was fate that took me down into the place,. I want to cross the borders of control.. Take me to the shrine that’s in your basement,. And hold me in that place I’ll lose it all.. So please take me down where the rain drops,. Please take me down so far below.. Come take me down to where my dream stops.. I don’t know where else I can go.. So please take me down to where the rain drops,. Please lay me down, down below.. Please leave me here where the dream stops,. Cause I don’t know where else I can go."
murder story,"You say to me things should soon be alright. I get so scared if I don't get out at night. The questions real. The answer so false. I just can't cope no more with this rate of pulse. I lost my past. I gave it away. I feel so insecure. I couldn't take another day. Please be kind. Don't call me no wreck. My nerves are very live you know. But soon they're going to break. No Oh No. Another Murder Story. No Oh No. Another Murder Story. So don't come too close. I can't stand the heat. I get nightmares of places people go to meet. It's so apparent when I walk in the door. That I'm all alone. There's no one home and no one wants me anymore. So claustrophobic if I stand I one place. This state of mind I'm in is positively quite a disgrace. The children from the street call out my name. ""Hey You"". It's all so mutual but you know. I just don't want to share no fame. No Oh No. Another Murder Story. No Oh No. Another Murder Story. No Oh No. Murder Story. No Oh No. No Oh No. Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Burchill/Kerr (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission."
my life,"I can feel it in the darkness. Getting closer in the night. Like a sacred song. You linger on. You give me the wings of flight. And I love your sense of power. Every hour every need. When the red light shows. Your arms enclose. Like the pillars of destiny. With one step forward. I know I can leave this behind. Never look backward. I want to move through space, through time. I want to get to it. Seek and you'll find. Check the world - do it it's my life. There's a star shines over you and I. It's my life. I'm just keeping my soul alive. There's talk of revolution. There's no solution to our plight. A red guitar can get you. But you still know how to fight. They say all roads come together. Every shoulder to the wheel. Solid gold future unfolds. When you give me the hands that heal. I'm looking out, and I call your name. I go running in a circle. But I can't get back again. And I'm calling I need you here. My whole life took a tumble. And I'm so filled up with fear. My life feels like a runaway train. I'm leading through a tunnel and I can't get back again. It's my life. Keeping my soul alive.

new warm skin,One fatal gift. Arrived here today. Heavenly sent. From the beauticians that pray. Here comes that face. And it's a textural treat. Is this a war?. Is this a god?. New. Warm. Skin. New. Warm. Expensive to touch. It's a novocaine skin. Beauty; this beast. Is transparent and thin. This sun can be cruel. I don't want to melt. Is this a war?. Is this a god?. New Warm Skin. New Warm Skin. New Warm Skin. New Warm. One fatal gift. Arrived here today. Contorted dreams. Of the beauticians that pray. Crawling out of this heat. And drifting this way. Is this a war?. Is this a god?. New Warm Skin. New Warm Skin. New Warm Skin. Is this a war?. Is this a god?. Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission.
night music,Can you hear the lone night music. Coming in so near. When I hear the lone night music. Every nightmare crumbles and they disappear. Can you hear the echoes calling. Speaking in verse. When I hear the lone night music. Everything gets stronger and I lose this curse. Help me break the chains that hold me. Keep me from the truth. I want to feel the hands that raise me. From a low down level to the highest roof. Woh oh night music. I hear it now. Night music. I want to catch the rock that's falling. Roll it back up hill. When I hear the strange night music. The whole world's turning and I'm still standing still. I feel it growing deep inside me. Still I'm at a loss. When I hear the strange night music. It's a warning signal there's a bridge to cross. Good news from the next world. Tear yourself apart. X still marks the time and place. To cure your bitter heart. Fell like running water. Water of the soul. Spinning like a spinning wheel. Way beyond control. Spinning like a spinning wheel. Way beyond control. Can you hear the lone night music. Coming in so far. When I hear the lone night music. It's a lonely planet it's a burning star. I want to swim the widest ocean. Diving in so deep. When I hear the lone night music. Coming in so near. When I hear the lone night music. All my nightmares crumble. And they disappear. Written by : Kerr/Burchill Reproduced Without Permission.
no cure,(Originally called The Cocteau Twins). I see them walking. You know they're walking at night. Ohh in the dark you know. They're shining out so bright. Your sarky voices are gonna come on so near. As every picture becomes so clear. You. You come on so sharp. Yet be so nice. Tell me that you're so hot. But you're as cold as ice. There is no cure. You're so blind can't you see?. There is no cure. Can't buy no immunity. There is no cure. So keep your evil from me. There is no cure.. They like to stay. Ooh come on. Come on and stay up so late. You gonna talk of all the things you just wanna hate. You wanna come on. Come on. And make me so mad. Inside your heart. I know it feels so bad. You. You come on so sharp. Yet be so nice. Tell me that you're so hot. But you're as cold as ice. There is no cure. You're so blind can't you see?. There is no cure. Can't buy immunity. There is no cure. So keep your evil from me.

oh jungleland,"Somebody's screaming out. Somebody's knocking out. Somebody's calling out, come hear it again. Street bells are ringing out. Young girls are singing out. Boys are building up to be men. You've got the love. Then here comes the blood last. The father, the mother, the sister, the chain. Sweet inspirations. Or a cold hearted nations baby. The young man, the brothers, the killers explain. Oh Jungleland. They call you home sweet home. You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone. But there is a kid called Hope. And he's holding out his hand. He sees the Northern Lights. above this highrise land. Oh Jungleland. Oh Jungleland. Oh Jungleland. In the city, get out the city pretty quick. I've got a prayer, I wanna sing it to you. It says, may little children forget the wild things. But no one listens cause nobody cares. When you've got the love drugs. And you've got the long nights. You got the heartbeat that spirals to heaven. Here comes summer, here comes violence. Over your shoulder the soul boy explains. Oh Jungleland. They call you home sweet home. You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone. But there is a kid called Hope. And he's holding out his hand. He sees the Northern Lights. above the highrise land. But blood is thicker than water. But blood is sweeter than Holy Lands. Unto the Devil a daughter. When my love sings it's an angel song she sings it. Don't look back, never look back. Don't look back, never look back. Oh Jungleland.

once upon a time,"And you. Yes you speak to me tonight. And you say so, say so. That once upon a time. When love, love was a white dove. And hope, long live hope, could spin the whole world 'round. I'm talking east to west. I'm talking lost and found. Get up to the mountain top. I'm going to drop unto the ground. That's once upon a time. You raise me up when I know you're around. But God only knows, what God only knows. You lift me up and you spin me around. God only knows, but God only knows. That's time. Time looked around herself. Time got excited. That's when we all got started. Still I hear you, yes still you speak to me tonight. You say then how come out of love, is all this cruelty arising?. Well I said, look, well will you look at you, you're frightened. I see that you smile through weariness. But there is not much else enlightened. Well, that's a question down to time. You life me up when I know you're around. God only knows, God only knows. Still you raise me up when I know you're around. God only knows, God only knows. That's time.

pleasantly disturbed,Black lines call out from his face. Oh his heart beats staccato pace. She says he's not killing time. I just don't want him for no friend of mine. Meanwhile Susan goes out all alone. So many reasons but they're not all her own. Bend till you break. Scream if you must. Someone's in her room. Someone she don't trust. Can you see me I'm in the lukewarm rain. Try so very hard. You know I just can't explain. Think of a colour. Tell me what you see. That colour's red. You can take it from me. Take it from me. Take it from me. I've seen the streetlights. Shine on the underground. I've heard the dead fight. When there's no other sound. I've seen the streetlights. Shine on the underground. I've heard the dead fight. When there's no other sound. Streetlight. Streetlight. Streetlight. Streetlight Sweetlight.

premonition,Real to real. Fact to fact. Nothing moving happening. Artifact. The waiting room. Waits. Limbo can burn. But the original sin. The incentive to learn. Fly over land. Where no hearts can beat. The metal rain pouring. Raining. Raining. Raining down on me. Hole in my head. Where the creature has crawled. And It's burning and turning. Out of control. Real to real. Fact to fact. Nothing moving happening. Artifact. I in this land. Sand in the eye. So here we go. The happy man dies. Brave little world. Well you cry once again. Remodel life. Remake and remodel. Remoel men. Protection Protection. The sound of machines. Image is burning. As they grind to a halt. Crying and crying. The sound of the shells. Tears turn to salt. Cry and I cry. Just one more illusion. I cry just for you. There's a hole in my head. Where the voices came through. Fly over land. Waiting and waiting. Where no hears can beat. Machinery's burning. The metal rains pour. Pour. Raining. Raining down on me. Premonition. Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission.
promised you a miracle,Promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Chance as love takes a train. Summer breeze and brilliant light. One love she sees. He controls on love. Love sails to a new life. Promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Only love she sees. He controls on love. Life mirrors a cure. Everything is possible. With promises. Everything is possible. Oh no. I promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Chance reflects on them a while. Love screams so quietly. Slipping back on golden times. Breathing with sweet memories. Promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Only love she sees. He controls on love. Life mirrors a cure. Everything is possible in the game of life. Everything is possible. Oh no. Chance lost pearls of great price. Take care of family. Only aches for love. Love waits for fame. In chance in chance they'll see. I promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Only love she sees. He controls on love. Life throws a cure. Everything is possible in the game of life. A burning dream. You can be Queen. Everything is possible. Words & Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission.
real life,"Paula came from Washington with long golden hair. Twenty eight dollars in a fake silk purse and a leather skirt to wear. Shane came from Dublin town from the old world so green. Counterfeit ticket in to JFK in the land of his dreams. Street life's the only life they take a walk in the park. Even tough they only met that day they were lovers by dark. Laid out on the morning skies he puts a ring on her hand. He said listen babe we gotta take what's ours do it or die. Quit dreaming this is real life baby. Real life's the only life what's it all about. Quit dreaming this is real life baby. Way out on the dock that night the colour is red. 23rd victim of a gangland war takes his last breath. Outside the sister cried she said the whole world's so mean. Heavyweight killer in the ring, turns killing machine. Quit dreaming this is real life baby. Real life's the only life what's it all about. Quit dreaming this is real life baby. All my love, you're my all. They way you move, you're in control. The way you talk, the way you dress. Your hands, your touch, your sweet caress.. All my love, you're the best,. Every little thing that I possess,. It's all emotion when you take control,. I can feel wild horses running in my soul.. Oh my love, all I see. The stars, the sun, the energy,. If this going to kill us then let it go,. Quit dreaming this is real life baby. Up high above a desert sky where the space shuttles scream,. Sixteen men from a dying earth take their last dream.. Quit dreaming this is real life baby. Quit dreaming this is cheap life baby. Real life's the only life what's it all about. Quit dreaming this is cheap life baby. Your eyes, your lips, the shape of your mouth,. It's a sweet life baby. All my love, you're my all. The way you move, the way you go. I'm all emotion when you take control. I can feel wild horses running in my soul.. All my love, you're all I see. The stars, the sun, the energy,. The way you move, you're in control.

rivers of ice,Don't need the money nothing can buy. All that I feel under the skies. Shadows were falling my heart beat inside. We walk through the fields to the rivers of ice. Days turn to colour and darkness to light. She said I want you I need you I want you in my life. Love in the shadows the blood rushed inside. Carry on little saviour to the end of the line. I get high for ever. Till the river runs dry for every. Ooh for ever. It's been so many years now I still can't forget. Love flew like an eagle in God's wilderness. Shadows were falling oh my heart beat inside. We kissed on the bridge above the river of ice. I get high for ever. The river runs dry for ever. I get high for ever. The river runs dry for ever. Ooh she tells me. Ooh she tells me. Tell the end of the line. Shadows were falling. On rivers of ice. Music : MacLachlan Lyrics and Arrangement by : Kerr/Burchill Reproduced Without Permission.
rockets,"Your love’s like faith,. Your love’s spite in your eyes from those battle days.. There’s still one way,. Abandoned now no matter what you say.. Just one truth,. Moving up to decide that’s your battle move,. No one’s here,. Some phantoms realised that’s your only fear.. You’re sending me rockets,. Fools circle again,. More than I realised.. You’re sending me rockets.. Full circle again.. Still sending me rockets.. I could still cut through,. A war machine with its missiles set on you.. I still want you,. Misty eyes clear to find another view.. And still you’re sending me rockets.. And I surrender again,. No more will I feel this time.. You’re sending me rockets.. Fools circle again.. Still sending me rockets.. Fools circle again.. Home sweet home,. No idea of divides or where the peace has gone.. No words to blame,. Surrender leaves me in the dark again.. You’re sending me rockets,. Fools circle again,. No matter how I plead this time.. You’re sending me rockets,. Fools circle again,. More than I realised.. You’re sending me rockets.. You’re sending me rockets.. Keep sending me rockets.. Still sending me rockets.. Fools circle again"

sad affair,I called you last night. But I got no reply. There's something not right. By the look in your eye. Makes me laugh. To walk the path. So many pass this way. It's so unreal. I can't help but feel. I gotta wake you from this daze. Listen to a world of your own. You've got to leave me alone. Sweet mother calling up now. Don't want to speak to no fool. She say I got to look out. For I've got to find the jewels. I have some precious momements. Into the night I stare. To dream of something special. Ooh Another sad affair. When all your trust. Turns to dust. And you're lost for words to say. You've got so much more to see before. You turn to walk away. Listen to a world of your own. You've got to leave me alone.. Ooh another sad affair. Another sad affair. Ooh another sad affair. Another sad affair. It makes me laugh to walk this path. So many pass this way. It's so unreal. I can't help but feel. I gotta wake you from this daze.

sanctify yourself,"Is this the age of the thunder and rage. Can you feel the ground move 'round your feet. If you take one step closer, it'll lead to another. The crossroad above is where we meet. I shout out for shelter, I need you for something. The whole world is out, they're all on the street. Control yourself, love is all you need. Control yourself, in your eyes. Sanctify yourself, sanctify. Be apart of me, sanctify. Sanctify yourself, sanctify. Sanctify yourself, set yourself free. In pictures of living, in bloodshot a vision. Sweet miracles and strange circumstances. I see the sun up, the showdown, the cool winds that blow down. On the big beat that life-long romance is. You've got a gun in your hand, you're making self plans. Stay with me all through the night. Control yourself, love is all you need. Control yourself, open up your heart. Sanctify yourself, sanctify. Be apart of me, sanctify. Sanctify yourself, sanctify. Sanctify yourself, set yourself free. You can't stop the world for a boy or a girl. Sweet victims of poor circumstances. But you can pour back the love, sweeping down from above. Giving hope and making more chances. Well, I hope and I pray that maybe someday. You'll come back down here and show me the way. Control yourself, love is all you need. Control yourself, open up your heart. Open up your heart. Sanctify yourself, sanctify. Sanctify yourself, sanctify. Sanctify yourself, set yourself free.

But you could cut the atmosphere with a knife around here. 'Cos you know there is no compromise. Chorus:. When the moon lights up the street like diamonds. And all is still and quiet once again. I like to pull you here and whipser in your ear. Tell you what about the loney man. Ooh Saturday Girl. Is somebody there. I said is somebody there. I can see you there. I can fell you there.

see the lights,Summer's gone winter's in your eyes. I can feel the thunder storms inside. I wake every morning and the cold winds cover me. All I've got's a ghost of what could be. If you can see the lights shine in front of me. If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be. I'm in a broken dream I stare out into space. You know I called you up cos nothing takes your place. I've got a heart of stone and it's sinking deep inside. I want to tell you love I'm too proud to cry. If you can see the lights shine in front of me. If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be. Summer's gone and I can't tell you lies. Oh forgive me love I'm too proud to cry. If you can see the lights shine in front of me. If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be. Summer's gone and I can't tell you lies. Forgive me love I'm too proud to cry. Too proud to cry.

seeing out the angel,Voice leading to voices. Last song that the land sings. In colourful breathless emotional sea. Leaving us in this way. Seeing out the angel. From the shadow of a day. That stands alone and crying young. Singing fascination. For the twist in anxious days. That stand alone and crying young. See out the angels. For the rescue pools of life. That stand alone and crying young. Rescue by the first light. Receiving us with these tears. Feeling your gaze in the back of my eyes. Leaving worlds this way. In voice leading to voices. Last song that the land sings. In colourful breathless emotional sea. Leaving us this way. Seeing out the angels. Singing fascination....

sense of discovery,"Put your hands on me. Rage will dissolve like the wind. One last moment. The days were closing in. The ray of light. Was faltering. Was no more sequence. No words could tell. The pace of time. Was gathering. And you saved yourself for me. And you lead me to a sense of discovery. Waiting for a moment that you think won't come. Belief is no illusion but you must go on. The heart is like a temple, one you cannot see. Inside this world's discovery. From the desert to the ocean a revolving sun. The journey now has just begun. The heart is like a temple, one you cannot see. Inside these walls just you and me. So put your hand on me. One last moment. The waves were rolling in. The ray of light. Was faltering. And you placed your hands on me. Waiting for a moment that you think won't come. Belief is no illusion but you must go on. The heart is like a temple, one you cannot see. Inside this world's discovery. From the desert to the ocean a revolving sun. The journey now has just begun. The heart is like a temple, one you cannot see. Inside these walls just you and me. So put your hand on me. So I'll see. That the rage will dissolve like the wind. Endlessly. No more life cast away, so lonely. When you led me to this sense of discovery. So put your hand on me. So I will see. That the rage will dissolve like the wind. Endlessly. Inside this world's discovery. Waiting for a moment that you think won't come. Belief is no illusion but you must go on. The heart is like a temple, one you cannot see. Inside this world's discovery. From the desert to the ocean a revolving sun. The journey now has just begun. The heart is like a temple, one you cannot see. Inside these walls just you and me. Waiting for a moment that you think won't come. Belief is no illusion but you must go on. The heart is like a temple, one you cannot see. (Put your hand on me). From the desert to the ocean a revolving sun. The journey now has just begun. The heart is like a temple, one you cannot see.

seventy cities as love brings the fall,He wants the world. Screams everything. Follows in love. Love brings the fall. She is a country. Feel for life. Follows in love. Love brings the fall.

she knows,"I never lie or I don't live at all.. First comes the rush then comes the fall.. I wonder why it's a torturous thing.. Tearing me up on the count of three.. She knows, she knows.. She's waiting there for me.. She knows and she knows.. She's waiting there for me.. How I feel I try to explore,. Hidden inside and tangled to more.. Not troubled by the rush that it brings,. I know what it's like but I can't do a thing.. She knows, she knows.. She's waiting there for me.. And she knows, she knows.. She's waiting there for me.. I want to know what star you are.. Why you're so good to me.. Why you're so good to me.. Morning comes and I unlock the door,. I tumble outside I've been here before.. Never so sweet as after the sting,. Tired life free still circling.. She knows, she knows.. She's waiting there for me.. And she knows, she knows.. She's waiting there for me.. And she knows, she knows.. She's waiting there for me.. And she knows, she knows.. She's waiting there for me."
she moved through the fair,"My young love said to me,. My mother won't mind,. And my father won't slight you,. For your lack of kind.. Then, she stepped away from me,. And this she did say:. ""It will not be long love,. 'Til our wedding day."". She stepped away from me,. And she moved through the fair,. And fondly I watched her,. Move here and move there.. Then she made her way homeward,. With one star awake,. As the swan in the evening,. Moves over the lake.. I dreamt it last night,. That my dead love came in,. So softly she moved,. That her feet made no din.. Then she came close beside me,. And this she did say:. ""It will not be long love,. 'Til our wedding day."". Music : Traditional. Lyrics : Traditional.

she's a river,"Shadow let go. There's something you should know. I just found my new direction. And I hope you like the key. Like the air that led me to it. She's like the wind that sucked me through it. She's a river and she's turning there in front of me. Stand back - get back. She'll paint your blue skies black. She gives bullet proof protection. Got a resurrection feel. When I'm scared, and 'bout to lose. She gives me travelling shoes. She's a river and she's turning in front of me. And I go blind. Wasting my time. While the rivers in front of me. That's where I'm goin' to be. Shine on, get on. Twilight from dusk to dawn. She's the spirit of creation. She's the last chance guarantee. Got a myriad of poses. Sweet miracles and roses. She's a river and she's turning in front of me. 'Cause when I find. My state of mind. The river's in front of me. They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms. So take me on that freedom ride. My heart is like a hunter's in the silent moon. My nerves just feel electrified. Meet me on the staircase. Outside a darkened room. Light me like a naked flame. The voice of Mother Nature states. All things must pass. And nothing can remain. They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms. So take me on that freedom ride. You raise me like a building to the very top. Rush me to the end of time. You fill me full of danger. You give me future shock. Then you leave me wasted dying. And I go blind. Wasting my time.

Shadows of brilliant ways will change all the time. Memories, burning gold memories. Gold of day memories change me in these times. Somewhere there is some place, that one million eyes can't see. And somewhere there is someone, who can see what I can see. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime. Someone, Somewhere In Summertime.

song for the tribes,And from the other side. A sheer white knuckle ride. So young yet feel so stung by the game. I know what's left in a name. With all those national strains. The lion hits the stage. Purple hearts revolving round with purple rage. And we all want to know where the weather goes. And what's in store tomorrow. No we don't need a replacement. The more I see the more I learn. All that time in the basement. I can't wait nor hang around. Language that shocks of the new. With the promise there's nothing to hide. When vultures rise out of the blue. And the circle of fireflies tonight. And all that heavenly light. I can't understand. The coup d'etat that walks inside every man. They all wanna know 'bout the fasion show. Where the Queen will go tomorrow. Tomorrow. Where the Queen will go tomorrow. Where the Queen will go tomorrow. No we don't need a replacement. The more I see the more I learn. All that time in the basement. I can't wait nor hang around. Feel real power in the darkness. The more I see the more I learn. Feel it more than I confess. I can't wait nor hang around. I'll be outside. I'll be outside. Song for the tribes. Song for the tribes. The more I see the more I learn. No we don't need a replacement.

Beauty sleeps in time. Sound and fury play. Ma son warm land semi-monde. Ma son warm land semi-monde. Cry because you're young. Governments and gifts. Hearts are in our mouths. Thank you for the voice. Thank you for the eyes. Thank you for the good times. Golden guns and cars. Styles and motorcades. In screaming beauty days. Ma son warm land semi-monde. Ma son warm land semi-monde. Only winds that twist. When white money calls. Falling here from grace. White-eye movement trust. Parades are leaving town. When boys of Venice call. In all stations trust. In all stations soul. Sons and fascination. Ma son warm lands semi-monde. Ma son warm lands semi-monde.

soul crying out,"Listen to the rhythm. Listen to the beat. It has a cold wind blowing. Up through the street. Soul crying out. People crying out. In through the valleys. In through the streets. Feel the whole world moving. Underneath our feet. Something's going on. I said what is going wrong. I feel them coming. So close behind. Sister says, we're next in line. The man he says, that's OK. And the Government says you're gonna pay, pay, pay. And you pay. Still you pay. It's just a soul crying out. It's just the people crying out. It's the land crying out. And I can hear you crying out. And I say, I don't know. Maybe I don't care. What I know is. I gotta get out of here. And I'm going. Going any day. Some sweet day. Some sweet day. I gotta find a way. I can hear the lovers, whisper in the street. See a crowd has gathered underneath the heat. I hear what they say. But I don't believe what they say. I see the woman, with tears in her eyes. I hear the baby, calling in the night. Something on the bed, was it something she said. Hell this is not right. What goes on through the night. I hear her coming, all in my mind. Sweet common love, so hard to find. Someone said, man that's sa. And the people walk by, cos they're so blind. And you pay. Still you pay. It's just a soul crying out. Just the people crying out. It's the earth crying out. And I can hear you crying out. And I can feel you crying out. And I say, I don't know. Maybe I don't care. All I know is, I gotta get out of here. And I'm going, going any way. Do you know, some place to go. I'm getting out of here. Where will I find some peace of mind. I'm getting out of here. I come walking to you. I come singing to you. Some sweet day. I'm gonna walk away. I'm gonna walk away. It's just the soul crying out. It's just the land crying out. It's just the children crying out. All the babies crying out. Any way, some sweet day. I'm gonna walk away. Turn away. It's just the soul crying out. It's just the land crying out. I wanna hear. I want you here. Some sweet day. Just a soul crying out. Of a land crying out anyway. When you say. Some sweet day.... Words And Music : Simple Minds Reproduced without permission."

speed your love to me,"I couldn't sleep a wink last night. I'd love to hold on. Love to see the fires in motion. Love to feel a free world turn tonight. Run till we come, until we be. Speed your love to me. Run till we come, until we be. Speed your love. Run till we come, until we be. Speed your love to me. She would like to make a wish. Twenty fourth cannot be this. He moved at the speed of light. Through the day and through the night. Fire from the flame of youth. Fire. Run till we come, until we be. Speed your love to me. Just my imagination, just my imagination. You go to my head, you go to my head. With the flames that go higher and higher. And higher and higher and higher and higher.

stand by love,"You know my heart beats rhythm and my dreams still take me higher. I've travelled round the world but they can't cure my desire. The city looks pretty tonight. Hold on now let's go till morning. Get up on love and stand by me. Stand by love, stand by me. I'm a shell shocked lover, under cover that's my game. I'm your long lost brother, little sister what's your name. I feel so alone. I'm stranded and so far from home I'm calling. Get up on love and stand by me. Stand by love, and stand by me. Stand by love. Love - stand by love stand by me. Stand by love stand by me. Give me one good reason why you don't come play with fire. 'Cos when the earth starts moving you know I'm no liar. The city looks pretty tonight. Oh hold on now let's go till morning. Get up on love and stand by me. Stand by love, and stand by me. Stand by love stand by. Stand by love. Stand by love stand by me.

stars will lead the way,"I’m the one who broke apart,. I’m the one that’s free.. I’m the one who fell apart,. Yes I’m the one, that’s me.. I’m the one who fell away,. The one who didn’t care.. But there is a long trail,. Stretching now from here to there.. Stars will lead the way,. Stars will light the sky,. Stars will fall through for you and I.. From the darkest days to the darkest side,. there is a long trail stretching here to you and I.. I’m the one who lost the sense,. the one who couldn’t see.. I’m the one who lost the chance,. Within this odyssey.. I’m the one who failed to feel,. The blackout of the sun.. There’s an old tale telling me that it’s just begun.. Stars will lead the way,. Stars will light the sky,. Stars will fall here, now for you and I.. From the darkest days to the darkest side,. There is a long trail stretching here to you and I.. Stars will lead the way.. Stars will light the sky.. And I’m wandering in a trance, taken over me,. wandering in a world but I can't see.. Wandering in trance, taken over me.. Taken over me,. Taken over me.. I’m the one who broke apart,. I’m the one that’s free.. I’m the one who broke apart,. the one that couldn’t see.. Stars will lead the way,. Stars will light the sky.. Stars will fall here for you and I.. From the darkest days to the darkest side,. Stars will fall, fall, fall, fall for you and I.. Stars will lead the way,. Stars will light the skies,. Stars will fall, fall, fall, fall for you and I.. Stars will lead the way,. Stars will light the skies."
stay visible,"The road opens wide,. there’s space here for two of us.. If I could slip under the wire. we’d wait here, just stay here a while.. Slumped, my body’s tired. and this fear never lets me sleep.. Your smile this trial elates,. in your eyes I see mothers open gates.. If fortune could smile. there’d be room here for two of us. and I would burn myself through the wires.. With hate concentrated, unearthed, disparate, in time.. Once in a while,. if peace held for two of us,. if we could show mercy awhile,. with patience transcending this cold never ending through time.. And if home still matters,. if these bones were not so shattered,. what state, so desperate,. within a hollow shell, in a forgotten state.. Come tear the dirt from my eyes."
stranger,"Tell me why, do you know what we’re looking for?. Any truth in the rumours I ignore?. Tell me why I still deny. any time secrets, in every sound.. I can keep my feet upon the ground;. in the air, reeling everywhere.. There’s something new and I must say. it makes me feel so super real.. Look and you’ll find we drift through space and time.. Stranger, beautiful stranger,. come tell me if you are the silent star, explain!. Stranger, beautiful stranger.. I wonder if you are the silent star, explain.. Tell me why, do you know what we’re looking for?. Any truth in the rumour I ignore?. Then tell me why I still deny.. Summertime, winter, moonlight and the sun,. I got the feeling this has just begun. and still it feels so super real.. Look and you’ll find we’re moving through space and time.. Stranger, beautiful stranger,. come tell me if you are the silent star, explain!. Stranger, beautiful stranger.. I wonder if you are the silent star, explain.. Sha la la la, sha la la la.. Beautiful stranger.. Sha la la la, sha la la la.. Beautiful stranger.. Tell me who you are.. Tell me who you are."
street fighting years,"Chased you out of this world, didn't mean to stop. I turned around and suddenly you where gone. Like some bird from paradise, the fire and ice. We turned around and suddenly you where gone, gone, gone. And now summer burns a hole inside and years are golden once again. My thoughts return to you my dear young friend. Oh come this way. Will you look down this way. I go down on the street. Where the wild wind's blowing. Here comes a hurricane. I say come down this way. Will you look down this way. I need you tonight. I need you around me. I'm looking through the windows. And my mind goes in a whirl. Well there's a multitude of candles. Burning in the windows of this world. I'm looking at the colours. Checking out the straights. I'm counting out the numbers. Will tomorrow never change?. Still I hear you and I love you. And I'll follow you elsewhere. And I'll remember this occasion. I'll remember being aware. 'Cause we've got panic in the evening. We've got fall-out in the streets. And I hear you and I follow you. And I'll call out and I'll say. That I can hear your sister call out. And I hear her call your name. They're calling sweet surrender. And things won't be the same. And don't you think that I don't care. And don't you think that I don't know. And don't you hear them calling out. In a place not far from here. And I hear big wheels are turning. Some things are not to fear. They say this is the time and place. They call street fighting years. And I hear great wheels are turning. And I tell you not to fear. They say this is the time and place. They call street fighting years. And I love you, I look for you. And I walk to you, I walk to you. And I hear big wheels are turning. Is there no way out of here?. They'll be calling out tomorrow..

street hassle,"Waltzing Matilda, looked at her wallet. The sexy one smiled in dismay. She pulled out four twenties. 'Cause she liked round figures. Everybody stayed for a day. I think I'm on fire and you know I admire you. Buy it, why don't we slip away. Although I'm sure you're certain. It's a rarity me flirting. Sha la la la lay, come on. Sha la la la la, Sha la la la la, Sha la la la la. Come on and slip away, Sha la la. Cascading lowly he entered her slowly. And showed her where he coming from. And sha la la la la. Made love to her gently. Just like she had never come. And sha la la la la. Sha la la la. When the sun rose and she made to leave. And sha la la la la. Sha la la la you know. Neither one regretted a thing. Say sha la la la la, Sha la la la la, Sha la la la la. Come on and slip away. Say sha la la la la, Sha la la la la, Sha la la la la. We need your loving so badly. We need your loving so. Slip away, come on, slip away. Sha la la la la, Sha la la la la. Love has gone away. She took the ring from my finger. And there's nothing left to say. We need your loving so badly. We need your loving so. Come on, slip away. Words And Music : Lou Reed (C) 1978 Metal Machine Music Ltd/RCA Music Ltd Reproduced without permission."

summer,"Here comes summer, here comes rain. Here comes all those mysteries, make me born again. Here comes lightning now, I like the way it shoots. Here comes all those mysteries taking me to my roots. And when the sun rises again. Into the fields I wake up. Into my dreams I descend. Where it's all so real. Here comes summer, here comes rain. Here comes all those energies, making me born again. Here comes lightning, I like the way it shoots. Here comes all those fantasies taking me to my roots. Here comes summer, here comes light. Here comes all those fantasies, taking me through the night. Here comes summer coming, here comes heat. Here comes that strange power taking me to my feet. And when the sun rises again. Into the fields I wake up. With no more dreams I descend. Where it's all so real. Here comes summer, here comes rain. Here comes all those energies, making me born again. Here comes lightning, I like the way it shoots. Here comes all those fantasies taking me to my roots. All those bodies. All those bodies move around. Oh all those bodies everywhere. Here comes summer, here comes rain. Here comes all those energies, making me born again. Here comes lightning now, I like the way it shoots. Here comes all those fantasies taking me to my roots"

(No baby). I ain't gonna play Sun City. Relocation to phoney homelands. Separation of families I can't understand. Twenty three million can't vote 'cause they're black. We're stabbing our brothers and sisters in the back I'm gonna say. Out Government tell us ""we're doing all we can"". Constructive engagement is Ronald Reagan's plan. Meanwhile people are dying and giving up hope. This quiet diplomacy ain't nothing but a joke. Chorus:. It's time to accept resposibility. Freedom is a priviledge nobody rides for free. Look around the world baby it cannot be denied. Why we're always on the wrong side. Chorus:. Boputhuswana is far away. But we know it's in South Africa no matter what they say. You can't buy me I don't care what you pay. Don't ask me Sun City 'cause I ain't gonna play. Chorus:. Relocation to phoney homelands. Separation of families I can't understand.

superman v supersoul,"Rhada come to it. Brother slide through it. Sister rise - don't you care?. Come on taste the mountain air. Innocence comes to chance. The mystery and spirit of romance. Butterflies make you sigh. And Kali-Yuga's miles away. Procession gets in line. With words of wedding day rhyme. It'll make you cry. Kali-Yuga's miles away. And the young girl's eyes are miles away. And the dust still lies miles away. Rhada come to it. Brother slide through it. Sister rise - don't you care?. Come on taste the mountain air. Innocence comes to chance. Mistery, spirit of romance. It'll make you cry. Kali-Yuga's miles away. And the dust will rise miles away. The young girls sigh miles away. And the dust will rise miles away. Don't let me down. Don't let me down. Blossoms cry to it. Chariots take you there. Climbing through mists like marble white stairs. Milliseconds - take a glance. Catch the mystery dance. Never want to lose this chance.

swimming towards the sun,"Razor dragon junkies lie,. The bottom of the pool desire,. Swim towards the sun.. Every day ain't Mothers' Day,. And every woman ain't your mum,. Sometimes funky isn't fun..

People throw Forget-Me-Nots,. The bullets through the flesh they shot,. Tatty with the name.. It's harder to forget the hate,. When it's the only thing you generate,. And it's you I'd like to blame.. It will be easy,. To blame somebody else.. But at this particular point in time,. I'd like to take the blame myself.. I.... I'm swimming towards the sun.. And I.... I'm not the only one.. And I....

take a step back,"Go tell it on the mountain. Like it burst forth like a fountain. Try to shake the deep foundations of this land. High up on lover's land. They got hotel rooms so grand. And no one here knows what goes behind closed doors. Take a step back to the middle of the track. Don't you know it's rumoured all around. Says you know it's come to town. Come on and take a step back to the middle of the track. 'Cos the rumours are around said you're coming back to town. And with every little lie. You come and never blink an eye. You know you've got yourself all tied up. When you're around. I've got the modern world behind me. Like a needle in a haystack find me. They build you up and then they're going to burn you down. So take a step back to the middle of the track. The rumours all around. Said you're coming back to me. Come on and take a step back to the middle of the track. Says you know it's going upside, you know what's going down. I'm haunted by the wanderer deep inside. Wanted by. Haunted by. I'm haunted by the wanderer that's deep in my soul. Gonna look back to the middle of the track. And you know it's going upside. Le, le, da, le. Telling me. Ah ha, uh hu. Ooh look back to the middle of the track. And you know it's going upside. Telling me.... Don't tell me it's a bad dream. Don't tell me it's not what it seems. Don't tell me pretty soon you know. Gotta stop the roller coaster. Gotta make the most of it. Gonna pull you down.

tears of a guy,"Lone child in the wild. A bird that's lost at sea. The words that whisper in the silent film. Say 'tomorrows gone for me'. All night lying with your head in my hands. And I search for reasons why. But if I can't get to it - I can't get through it. All that's gone now - all that's.... The tears of a guy. Is all I ever see. The tears of a guy. So many rivers run to me. Wake up dreaming with the sun in my eyes. Hear me screaming, don't ask why. Some strange music from some sweet soul song. Says I can't feel it - I can't try. Time goes - and the fountain still flows. I'll be watching through fortunate eyes. But I can't get cured - I must endure. All that's gone now - all that's.... The tears of a guy. Is all I ever see. The tears of a guy. So many rivers run to me. Drift by the walls - this way. Babylon - in your eyes. Drift by the walls - this way. Babylon - in your eyes. So many rivers run through me. (And we will walk). Oh little angel. It's all I ever see. (And we will rise). So many rivers run to me. (And we will walk). Oh my little angels. In your eyes. So many rivers run through me.

the jeweller part 2,"Lyrics to The Jeweller Part 2 :. It’s a long cold distance through the galaxies.. If my eyes were open wide maybe I could see.. If a burned out future seems like all that’s in store. I’d tumble to the ground like a fading meteor.. Jeweller to the stars, Jeweller to the stars,. Jeweller to the stars, that’s who you are.. That’s who you are.. Ever been out walking where the air gets thin,. or stranded on a planet losing out on oxygen?. Scream out “listen” in a silent place,. feel that you’re falling, calling into space.. Jeweller to the stars, Jeweller to the stars,. Jeweller to the stars, that’s who you are.. that’s who you are.. that’s who you are.. It’s a long cold distance through the galaxies.. My eyes were open wide, oh desolately.. If a burned out future seems like all that’s in store. I’d tumble to the ground like a fading meteor.. Jeweller to the stars, Jeweller to the stars,. Jeweller to the stars, that’s who you are.. that’s who you are."
the kick inside of me,"You put the storm out, that's up in my head. You put the call out. Beside of me, kick up inside of me. And you steal the world and live to survive. And shake out the ghosts and then you turn around. In spite of me, kick up inside of me. One for the first time. Two for the last time. Three for the thrill and. Four for the last time. As far as I can see, you're gonna. Move deep deeper deep inside of me. Kick away my life kick away. You put the fear in me, kick away, kick away. As far as I can see you move deep deep inside of me. Take me away, take me away, up to another day. Open up the way, lead me away in the pouring rain. In the pouring rain. You put the storm out, that's up in my head. You put the call out. Beside of me, kick up inside of me. And we steal the world and live to survive. Shake out the ghosts and turn around. In spite of me, shake up the ghosts inside of me. One for the first time, two for the last time. Three for the thrill, and four for the last time. As far as I can see, you're gonna. Move deep deeper deep inside of me.

the man who sold the world,"We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when. Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend. Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes. I thought you died alone, a long long time ago. Oh no, not me. I never lost control. You're face to face. With The Man Who Sold The World. I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home. I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed. I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here. We must have died alone, a long, long time ago. Who knows? Not me. We never lost control.

the signal and the noise,"Take off those headphones and let this world pour into you. Throw off those glasses and then you'll start seeing. Forget those battles, those ones that mean nothing to you. Know you're alive and just smile, you'll start hearing. Somewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere. Somewhere out among the silence there's a voice. There's a feeling that takes over and it has no fear. When you're caught between the signal and the noise. Shout out the names of everyone. that feels most dear to you. Praise to the moon and the sun and you'll start feeling. Shut out those ghosts with their talk is far too negative. Make love your armor and smile and you'll start hearing. Somewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere. Somewhere out among the silence there's a voice. There's a feeling it takes over and it has no fear. When you're caught between the signal and the noise. And the noise. And the noise. And the noise. Somewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere. Somewhere out among the silence there's a voice. There's a feeling it takes over and it has no fear. When you're caught between the signal and the noise. You're just caught between the signal and the noise"
thirty frames a second,"Today I saw a film going backwards. Thirty Frames A Second. Was a man I recognised. Say who you are. I lost my job. Security. Self confidence. Bank account. Identity. The league of youth. Coming backward at me. Thirty Frames a second. Say who you are. Go back to father. Father where's my food?. You food is on the table. That can't be food. It's dirt. Say who you are. Look at my skin. Look at my face. Look at my arms. Getting younger. Going backwards. Thirty Frames A Second. Say who you are. I crash my car. Collapse in town. Young immigrants. And legionaires. Fighting back back backwards. Thirty Frames A Second. Say who you are. Some friends of mine. I thought were dead. A coming back. ""What are you doing coming back. Jack"". Say who you are. Feel I'm going backwards. Thirty Frames A Second. Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission."
this earth that you walk upon,What's your name. What's your nation. Sense of order. Sense of speed. Earth that you walk upon. Shakes his hand. Turns away. Turns his back and walks away. Earth that you walk upon. Earth that you walk upon. What's your name. What's your nation. Sense of order. Sense of speed. Earth that you walk upon. Passing on and on. Earth that you walk upon. Screaming edge of light. Shines so shines so hard. Earth that you walk upon. Turning on
this fear of gods,Someone singing in the shower. Someone singing in the shower. Singing singing singing. Singing shower. Someone's singing in the shower. I hear a voice and hear no angel. I hear a voice and hear no angel. Hero see no hero see no. Hero see no. Hear and see no. Hear a voice and see no angel. Violence and vivisection. Violence and vivisection. Lust lust lust. Lust lust lust. Violence and vivisection. Gods. Gods. This fear of Gods. Some boys are calling. Boys are crying. Some boys are calling. Boys are crying. Calling calling calling. Crying. Calling calling calling. Crying. Fear is fast. I'm turning white now. Fear is fast. I'm turning white now. Faster faster faster. Faster faster faster. Fear is fast. I'm turning white now. Gods. Gods. This fear of Gods. I'm back on black. Fear of Gods. Back on black. Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission.
this is it,"When the feelings come to me once again,. And I still hear the words they’re saying.. And while I’m wondering if I can step in,. I‘ll take comfort in the sounds that’s playing.. 'Cause when I am feeling fine,. Don’t want to walk away,. Don’t want to lose myself,. No matter what I say.. There is a game in town,. This is it!. They call it the new change.. And when the feelings rise,. Pulling me off my knees.. I won’t be scared of it,. 'Cause I cant believe.. There is a game in town, This is it!. They call it the new change.. And when I’m pleading but I can't get in,. When no one’s listening to a word I am saying,. There is no reason why we can’t begin,. Broken hearts are congregating.. 'Cause when the feeling's fine,. And the world steps in.. I’ll organise myself,. I’ll get my mind moving.. There is a game in town,. This is it!. They call it the new change.. And when I’m running scared,. And I cant resist,. I’ll organise myself,. With all the chances missed.. There is a game in town,. This is it!. They call it the new change.. And when I’m running scared,. And I cant resist,. I’ll organise myself,. For all the chances missed.. There is a game in town,. This is it!. They call it the new change.. This is it, this is it, they call it the new change."
this is your land,"This is your land. It's the way it was planned. Sky to the sea, something to see. Old ancient town, to the old people ground. I wanna know, something to go. This is your land, laid out in your hand. This is your land. Wherever I go, way down here I know. This is your land. Oh churches and steeples, big city people. I wanna know something to hold. Walk down the track, to the old railroad track. I wanna leave something to see. This is your land, laid out in your hand. This is your land. Wherever I go, way down here I know. This is your land. Money can't buy me. Money can't buy me. I've got time. Time is on my side. You don't know what you've got till the whole thing's gone. The days are dark and the road is long. And when you walk away, the hope is gone. Tell me what is right, and what is wrong. Is this the way it was planned. This is your land, take it in your hand. This is your land. Wherever I go, way down here I know. This is your land, take it in your hand. This is your land. Wherever I go, way down here I know. This is your land.

this time,"What you gonna do about it. How you gonna live without it. Some of us are getting proud. And I don't know if that's allowed. People just can't forget it. This time!. Some of us are getting strong. Never want to wait too long. This time. And now I want to get away. I know what I want and I say what I say. Never want to live without it. This time!. And when the feelings show. I need the time to know. If I'm goin' to get it right. And when the feelings show. I need the faith to know. Well I don't know if I've got the message right. People can't get by without it. This time. Love is gonna get requited. This time. Some of us are getting strong. And I don't know if that's so wrong. Never want to wait to get it. This time. And when the feelings show. Tell me do you know. It I'm gonna get it right. When the light go low. Tell me do you know. Oh, I need to know. If I'm gonna get it right. People go to war to get it.

today i died again,The human drum. Beats a rhythm of life. The clothes he wears. Date back to the war. He talks alot. Often to himself. She don't say much. Just cuts his hair. She can't remember. Before the heat. He can't remember. His wife's christian name. Paint me a picture. Towers in sand. America can fall. Today I died again. I died again. I died today. Today I died again. I died again. I died today. Back to a year. Back to a youth. Of men in church and drug cabarets. Is this the age. Of empires and dance. Oh what a world. Oh what a world. She can't remember. Before this heat. He can't remember. His wife's christian name. Paint me a picture. Bodies in sand. Presidents can fall. Today I died again. I died again. I died today. Today I died again. I died again. I died today.

travelling man,"The lights of the motel shine on to me. This is the land of the brave, sad and the lonely. The last ride's. Coming to me I can feel it. A new life. Screaming out and I can't miss it. Travelling man. Travelling man. You get away if you can. My body's shaking, my body's tired. Hookers to the left of me, killers on the inside. The last train. Left this station long ago. The headlights. Shine like diamonds in the snow. Like a travelling man. I'm a travelling man. Run away if you can. Cruel world keeps turning I'm dead on my feet. From the blue icy mountains to white city heat. Factory fire burns like a phoenix tonight. Spread your wings come on darling. And your eyes. Search for me but I can't see them. And your sweet mouth. It speaks to me but I can't hear it. And your - your sweet smile. Two thousand miles for your warm kisses. And your sweet child. I got one last chance and I can't miss it. No no no no. Travelling man. Like a travelling man. Well I'm a travelling man. Written by : Kerr/Burchill/Lipson Reproduced Without Permission."
twist/run/repulsion,Switch the light on. We can think it's dawn. Oh push along. Push along. Play a long song. I'm laughing at marine. Marine laughs back. Don't like those boys. Toy soldier boys. I'm lying in bed. You can play me fear. You can play me fear. Only rhythm I hear. You cut me up. With joys of life. I'm going somewhere. I'm going someplace. If caution is life. Then caution is sin. Contort contort contort. I'll win. These walls that close. Close in on me. Seductress shout. Seductress scream. Switch the light on. We can think it's dawn. Oh push along. Push along. Pray along. Play a long song. Lyrics : J Kerr Music : Simple Minds (C) EMI Publishing Ltd Reproduced without permission.
underneath the ice,"Underneath The Ice. Although every building’s standing tall,. I look to you as something that much greater.. I searched through all religion, in the hope that something would entice.. I dreamed of crossing bridges, mountain ridges,. From the Pole to the Equator,. But when I saw you skating by – I was underneath the ice.. I woke up staring at the sun,. I searched for you in every hidden angle.. All through my imagination, every face and place, every memory inside,. High above the clouds they say there are galaxies and other destinations.... And then I saw you skating by - but I was underneath the ice.. Today I dreamed another dream, predestined to come and save me... later,. Today I dreamed another dream that you would come to take me home,. From underneath the ice"
up on the catwalk,"Up on the catwalk, a big wheel is spinning. And Dollars to Deutchmarks, and pennies from heaven. And up on the catwalk, there's one hundred million. With letters from thousands that say ``Just who are you?''. There's one thousand names that can spring up in my mind. But you'd call it blackmail and that's just not my kind. And up on the catwalk, up on the catwalk. And I don't know why. I will be there, I will be there, I will be there. I will be there, I will be there. Up on the catwalk there's street politicians. That crawl in from Broadway, say then who are you. And up on the catwalk there's one thousand postcards. From Montevideo, say that I'll be home soon. Get out of Bombay and go up to Brixton And look around, to see just what is missing. And up on the catwalk, girls call for mother And dream of their boyfriends. And I don't know why. I will be there, I will be there, I will be there. I will be there, I will be there. Tonight, under the crystal light, I'll tell you everything I need. Tonight, under the crystal light, surrender everything to me. Up on the catwalk, and you dress in waistcoats. And got brilliantino, and friends of Kim Philby. You float through the night time, like manna from heaven. But what, what do I know, and just what do I know. And up on the catwalk, in sweat that glistens. And I don't know why and I don't know why. I don't know why. I will be there, I will be there, I will be there. I will be there, I will be there. Tonight, under the crystal light, I'll tell you everything I need. Tonight, under the crystal light, surrender everything to me. Angel Angel Angel Angel. Ah huh Ah huh Ah huh Ah huh. One thousand names that spring up in my mind. One thousand names that spring up in my mind. Like Deodata, Michaelangelo, Robert de Niro, so many others. Natasia Kinski and Martin Luther - there's room for others, away from me. Up on the catwalk, up on the catwalk, up on the catwalk. I don't know why..

utopia,"Utopia, utopia. Couldn't take it, last song. Had to listen, I put it on. Body trembled, needle fell. Music played somewhere else. High above the air is fading. Utopia, welcoming me. Did you see the light show?. Did you feel the falling snow?. Feel it on your skin?. Dancing to arcadia. Did you feel the cold flakes?. Catch them in your hand?. Kissing in a solar storm?. Kissing like there was no end?. Oh would you wait for me?. 'Cause I can't tell. If these memories. Belong to. Utopia, utopia. Utopia, utopia. Earth was shaking, get dragged along. On the dance floor, was not alone. Feeling breathless, I couldn't tell. Was transported to somewhere else. High above the air is free. Utopia, welcoming me. Did you see the light show?. Did you feel the falling snow?. Feel it on your skin?. That's the way [?] glows. Did you feel the falling snow?. Moving to utopia. Did you see the light show?. Did you feel the falling snow?. Feel it on your skin?. Dancing to arcadia. Did you feel the cold flakes?. Catch them in your hand?. Kissing in a solar storm?. Kissing like there was no end?. But would you wait for me?. 'Cause I can't tell. If these memories. Belong to. Utopia, utopia. Utopia, utopia. Utopia, utopia. Utopia, utopia. Oh would you wait for me?"
waiting at the end of the world,"Her working name was Venus,. Real name Kate Magill,. Been looking at the tarot cards,. All of us said she will.. Looking through the picture book,. One last chance to see,. A photograph of you and her,. From 1983.. When she was up all night,. Waiting for the end of the world,. And for you she was the only.... Walked just like St Peter,. Dressed in silk and tanned.. Knew every hip philospher,. Held everyone's command.. Said you'd like to see her,. If no one was around.. Said she looked like Nico,. From the Velvet Underground.. When she was up all night,. Waiting for the end of the world,. And for you she was so lonely.. Hey! D'you see?. A cloud rolling back to me?. And hey, it's true.. No turning back for you.. I once knew a boy like you,. Oh now what am I to do?. It's a thought that's never ending,. The place that time forgot.. You might try to comprehend,. But you can never see the lot.. Grounded by the wasted,. Pounded endlessly.. Blinded by the headlights,. Of the 20th century.. When we were up all night,. Just waiting.. I once knew a boy like you,. Waiting at the end of the world."
walk between worlds,"What will you do when there's so much to lose. But you won't pay the price to go on?. And where will you stand when there's no helping hand. Or no road to deter right from wrong. What good can it bring to ignore suffering. To shut out all the reason inside?. From life ordinary to the heights, they get scary. No reason it can't be denied. Oh brother, don't you know. The heart starts beating now?. Brother, can't you see?. There is no reason now. Walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds. When you walk between worlds, we will see. When you walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds. When you walk between worlds, you and me. So what will it bring when there's no offering. There's no music, no dreams, no way out?. No flag to unfold when you walk between worlds. No fear, no wisdom, no doubt. What good can it bring to ignore suffering. To shut out all the rage inside?. From life ordinary to the heights, the get scary. No reason it can't be denied. Oh brother, don't you know. The heart starts beating now?. Brother, can't you see?. There is no reason now. There is no reason now. Walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds. When you walk between worlds, you'll see. When you walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds. When you walk between worlds, you and me. Oh brother, don't you know. The heart starts beating now?"
wall of love,"Ooh great wall of love, build me a great wall of love. When the blind man sings about the peaceful things. You shout that it's not good enough. Ah we wait till daylight hours. Waiting for a sign from you. Golden temples concrete towers. Building mansions on the hillside next to you. In the city souls awaken bodies shaking. Oh pull me up let me see the view. And to the hungry in the gutter. We've deprived them bread and butter. Always not enough. No not enough. Great wall of love, build me a great wall of love. When the blind man sings about the peaceful things. You shout that it's still not enough.. Ah well it's not the sound of ghosts I hear. It's the devil with his chainsaw. And I'll be running through the ghettos. Through the townships of Soweto. Always not enough. No not enough. Brothers missing, babies kissing. And the thing that got to you. Burning never turning next to you. Ooh great wall of love. Build me a great wall of love. When the blind man sings about the peaceful things. You shout that it's still not enough. So listen to me darling. They've got worries they've got troubles on their mind. And when you hear them reaching out. They're reaching out for something they can't find. Oh I believe one great day the rain will come. And wash this mess away. Oh I believe one great day the rain will come. They've got silver and diamonds. They've got paradise around them. They've got blue skies so clear. They've got their prisoner in a wagon. While the children chase the dragon. And the free bird flies so clear. It flies away. Fly fly fly away. Fly away. Oh you fly away. And may your sweet lips sing to me. Let the bells ring wherever freedom be. One babe is born and another one dies. There's people making love tonight. People making love tonight. Ah people making love tonight. People making love. People making love tonight. People making love. I can hear them reaching out. I can hear them reaching out. I can hear them reaching out. I can hear them reaching out. Words And Music : Simple Minds Reproduced without permission."
war babies,"See the white clouds roll in. Spirits lying next to me. Catch the wildflower falling. It's the wound that never bleeds. Hear the Sirens calling. Spinning out their show. Hold - The moment close to me. Take it down too slow. Be mine, be mine, War Babies. Be mine, be mine, War Babies. Can you still keep going?. Shattered pieces left inside. To face the final, knowing. That there's somethings you can't hide. Be mine, be mine, War Babies. Be mine, be mine, War Babies. So will the force let go?. Or will the phantoms stay?. Let the foreteller be your sight. - It feels like something's happening today. Some shame's like no other. And nothing feels the same. Nothing feels the same. War Babies. Be mine, be mine, War Babies. Nothing feels the same. War Babies. War Babies. Nothing feels the same. Be mine. Be mine. War Babies. Written by : Kerr/Burchill Reproduced Without Permission."
wasteland,Can you see us now we're on our own. And every chance has just come and just gone. Now it looks so dark and so cold. Think of the minds we sold. We'd better speak now. We'd better speak now. We'd better speak now. We'd better speak now. I can remember things that looked so bright. And I could talk to you without all this spite. Can you picture all that's past. Does your face deform so fast. We'd better speak now. We'd better speak now. We'd better speak now. We'd better speak now. `Cause when I stop and look into your head. I think of all the things that you said. When I look up into your eyes. I see the creature that I despise. Kill now. Kill now. Kill now. Kill now. Can you see us now we're on our own. And every chance has just come and gone. I've been wrong but you've been unkind. There's so much more that I can't find. Wasteland. Wasteland. Wasteland....

when two worlds collide,"Shots ring out in Paris, the bells ring out in Rome. Your photo's in the paper, buy you're getting old. Footsteps in the carpark he's the governor of the night. The omens say crime don't pay but each dog has its price. When two worlds collide. The tears well inside. When two worlds collide. A boy is found in Naples, his body's in a ditch. His young life counts for nothing when somebody's getting rich. There's flowers on the table, he sips water she drinks wine. And I don't think that mercy is the language of our time. When two worlds collide. The teardrops inside. When two worlds collide. You break me up inside. Backstreet of Chicago a black man plays the gold. There's a man on every corner says he'd like to buy your soul. Bhuddists in the temple, bullets in the night. Steeping out of their world, into your world, into mine. In the jet black night. The tears well inside. When two worlds collide. You break me up inside. Two worlds collide. Written by : Kerr/Burchill Reproduced Without Permission."
white hot day,"Instrumental version called Bass Line. In time, only time, speak for time, in time. Time calls, time cries, sweet friend of mine. Time could be a place, a spirit and a face. Teardrops through time. While away below, the whirlwinds will blow. A pretty nation speaks in time. The beauty of it is, to waken up to. Shake the hand of time. In time, only time, we'll speak for time. On a quiet night of a white hot day. Whisper the things that will come our way. On a quiet night of a white hot day. Hold back the years, hold back the years. Time calls, time cries, sounds like a friend of mine. Time will run to meet, the slick and shiny beat. That creeps to me through time. While away below, the whirlwinds will blow. A pretty nation sleeps in time. The beauty of it is. We'll wake up to, shake the hand of time. In time, only time, in time, only time. In time. On a quiet night of a white hot day. Whisper the things that will come our way. On a quiet night of a white hot day. Hold back the tears, hold back the tears. In time, only time, we'll speak for time. On a quiet night of a white hot day. Whisper the things that will come our way. On a quiet night of a white hot day. Hold back the tears, hold back the tears. In time, only time. Quiet night of a white hot day. Whisper the things that will come our way. On a quiet night of a white hot day. Roll back the years, roll back the years. In time, only time, we'll speak for time. On a quiet night. Hold back the tears to another day. Quiet night of a white hot day. Hold back the tears, hold back the tears. Time, only time, speak for time. Quiet night of a white hot day. Whisper the things that will come our way. On a quiet night of a white hot day. Roll back the years, roll back the years. In time, only time, speak for time. Quiet night of a white hot day. Hold back the tears to another day. Quiet night of a white hot day.

Something going I can tell. The way you know its meant to be. There's something taking all your life. You're drifting far away from me. Spirit of the one I love walk in the room. It gets so hard when it's all too soon. Lover's lonely planet blue smoke in your eyes. Shine on get home when are you gonna rise. Shook my life. Mercury. You don't live here any more. Shine on.

She will epitomise, so let her rest in peace.. Something's going I can tell. The way you know it's meant to be. Something taking all your life. And you're drifting far away from me.
