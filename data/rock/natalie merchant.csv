owensboro,"Well, I lived in a town. Way down south. By the name of Owensboro. And I worked in a mill. With the rest of the â€œtrashâ€. As weâ€™re often called. As you know. Well, we rise up early. In the morning. And we work all day real hard. To buy our little meat and bread. Buy sugar, tea, and lard. Well, our children. Grow up unlearned. With no time to go to school. Almost before they learn to walk. They learn to spin and spoon. Well, the folks in town. They dress so fine. And spend their money free. But they would hardly look. At a factory hand. Who dresses like you or me. Would you let them wear. Their watches fine. Let them wear their gems. And pearly strings. But when that day. Of judgement comes. Theyâ€™ll have to share."

San Andreas Fault. Moved it's fingers. Through the ground. Earth divided. Plates collided. Such an awful sound. San Andreas Fault. Moved its fingers. Through the ground. Terra cotta shattered. And the walls came. Tumbling down. Oh promised land. Oh wicked ground. Build a dream. Tear it down. Oh promised land. What a wicked ground. Build a dream. Watch it all fall down.
wonder,"Doctors have come from distant cities just to see me. Stand over my bed, disbelieving what they're seeing. They say I must be one if the wonders of God's own creation. And as far as they see they can offer no explaination. Newspapers ask intimate questions, want confessions. They reach into my head to steal the glory, of my story.

but not for me,They're writing songs of love. But not for me.. A lucky star's above. But not for me.. With love to lead the way. I've found more skies of gray. Than any Russian play. Could guarantee.. I was a fool to fall. And get that way. Heigh ho alas and. Also lackaday.. Although I can't dismiss. The memory of his kiss. I guess he's not for me.. I know that love's a game. I'm puzzled all the same. Was I the moth or flame. I'm all at sea.. It all began so well. But what an end.. This time a gal could sure. Use a friend. When every happy plot. Ends in a marriage knot.
sympathy for the devil,"[ Mick Jagger/Keith Richards ]. Yow! Yow! Yow!. Umph, ca, umph, umph. Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm a man of wealth and taste. I've been around for a long, long year. Stole many a man's soul and fate. And I was 'round when Jesus Christ. Had his moment of doubt and pain. Made damn sure that Pilate.

Oh, the bottle has been to me. My closest friend, my worst enemy. Full of flavor I walked a fine line. Squandered it all and wasted my time. And I don't stand a chance among the living. For the lovers I've gambled and lost. Count my mistakes whatever the cost. I'll go off, I'll make myself scarce. Oh, come tomorrow. You won't find me here. Because I don't care to stay with the living. I don't think I'll remain with the living. And I don't care to stay with the living. No, I don't care to stay."

In a carnival of sights to see. All the cheap thrill-seekers. The vendors and the dealers. They crowded around me. Have I been blind?. Have I been lost inside myself and my whole mind?.

The scarlet welcome carpet that they just rolled out for me. And I've walked these streets. In the madhouse asylum they can be. Where a wild-eyed mystic prophet on a traffic island stopped. And he raved of saving me. Have I been blind?. Have I been lost inside myself and my whole mind?. Hypnotized, mesmerized, by what my eyes have seen. Have I been wrong?. Have I been wise to shut my eyes and play along?. Hypnotized, paralyzed by what my eyes have found. By what my eyes have seen. What they have seen?. Have I been blind?. Have I been lost?.

Lately it's occurred to me that I've had enough of that. and lately I've been satisfied by simple things. like breathing in and breathing out. Never again, not in this life. will I be taken twice. Never again, never on your life. Will I make that same mistake. I can't make it twice. Lately it's occurred to me. exactly what went wrong. I realized I compromised. I sacrificed far too much for far too long. Never again, not in this life. Will I be taken twice. Never again, not on your life. Will I make that same mistake. I can't make it twice. Starting out from here today. Swear I'm gonna change my ways. Once mistaken in this life. but never twice."

the dancing bear,"Oh, it's fiddle-de-dum and fiddle-de-dee. The dancing bear ran away with me. For the organ-grinder he came to town. With a jolly old bear in a coat of brown. And the funny old chap joined hands with me. While I cut a caper and so did he. Then 'twas fiddle-de-dum and fiddle-de-dee. I looked at him, and he winked at me. And I whispered a word in his shaggy ear. And I said, ""I will go with you, my dear. "". Then the dancing bear he smiled and said. Well, he didn't say much, but he nodded his head. As the organ-grinder began to play. ""Over the hills and far away. "". With a fiddle-de-dum and a fiddle-de-dee. Oh, I looked at him and he winked at me. And my heart was light and the day was fair. And away I went with the dancing bear. Oh, 'tis fiddle-de-dum and fiddle-de-dee. The dancing bear came back with me. For the sugar-plum trees were stripped and bare. And we couldn't find cookies anywhere. And the solemn old fellow he sighed and said. Well, he didn't say much, but he shook his head. While I looked at him and he blinked at me. Till I shed a tear and so did he. And both of us thought of our supper that lay. Over the hills and far away. Then the dancing bear he took my hand. And we hurried away through the twilight land. And 'twas fiddle-de-dum and fiddle-de-dee. When the dancing bear came back with me"

But now they only block the sun. They rain and snow on everyone. So many things I would have done. But clouds got in my way. I've looked at clouds from both sides now. From up and down and still somehow. It's cloud illusions I recall. I really don't know clouds at all. Moons and Junes and ferris wheels. The dizzy, dancing way you feel.

I've looked at love from both sides now. >From give and take and still somehow. It's love's illusions I recall. I really don't know love at all. Tears and fears and feeling proud.

But something's lost and something's gained. In living every day. I've looked at life from both sides now. From win and lose and still somehow. It's life's illusions I recall."
the peppery man,"The peppery man was cross and thin. He scolded out and scolded in. He shook his fist, his hair he tore. He stamped his feet and slammed the door. Heigh ho, the peppery man. The rabid, crabbed peppery man!. Oh, never since the world began. Was any one like the peppery man. His ugly temper was so sour. He often scolded for an hour. He gnashed his teeth and stormed and scowled. He snapped and snarled and yelled and howled. He wore a fierce and savage frown. He scolded up and scolded down. He scolded over field and glen. And then he scolded back again. His neighbors, when they heard his roars. Closed their blinds and locked their doors. Shut their windows, sought their beds. Stopped their ears and covered their heads. He fretted, chaffed, and boiled and fumed. With fiery rage he was consumed. And no one knew, when he was vexed. What in the world would happen next. Heigh ho, the peppery man. The rabid, crabbed peppery man!. Oh, never since the world began. Was any one like the peppery man"

Had been sighed. Where your heart had burst. Where you had died. I saw how they were lost and grieving. All half believing you were gone. The loss and the pain of it. Crime and the shame of it. You were gone. It was such a nightmare raving. ""How can we save him. From himself""."

There was a fanfare blowing. To the sun. That was floating on the breeze.. Look at Mother Nature on the run. In the nineteen seventies.. Look at Mother Nature on the run. In the nineteen seventies..

And I felt like getting high.. I was thinking about what a. Friend had said. I was hoping it was a lie.. Thinking about what a. Friend had said. I was hoping it was a lie.. Well, I dreamed I saw the silver. Space ships flying. In the yellow haze of the sun,. There were children crying. And colors flying. All around the chosen ones.. All in a dream, all in a dream.

If I'm on my knees. Groping in the dark. I'd be prying for deliverance. From the night into the day. But it's all grey here. It's all grey to me. I may know the word. But not say it. This may be the time. But I might waste it. This may be the hour. Something move me. Someone prove me wrong. Before night comes. With indifference. If I'm on my knees. I'm begging now. If I'm on my knees. Groping in the dark. I'd be prying for deliverance. From the night into the day. But it's all grey here. But it's all grey to me. I recognize the walls inside. I recognize them all. I've paced between them. Chasing demons down. Until they fall. In fitful sleep. Enough to keep their strength. Enough to crawl. Into my head. With tangled threads. They riddle me to solve. Again and again and agan.

The captain was a duck. With a packet on his back. And when the ship began to move. The captain said, ""quack, quack! """

In the ghetto (In the ghetto). As her young man dies,. On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',. Another little baby child is born."
indian names,"Ye shall say they all have passed away. That noble race and brave. That their light canoes have vanish'd. From off the crested wave. That 'mid the forests where they roam'd. There rings no hunter's shout. But their name is on your waters. Ye may not wash it out. 'Tis where ontario's billow. Like ocean's surge is curled. Where strong niagara's thunders wake. The echo of the world. Where red missouri bringeth. Rich tributes from the west. And rappahannock sweetly sleeps. On green virginia's breast. Ye say, their cone-like cabins. That cluster'd o'er the vale. Have fled away like wither'd leaves. Before the autumn gale. But their memory liveth on your hills. Their baptism on your shore. Your everlasting rivers speak. Their dialect of yore. Old massachusetts wears it. Within her lordly crown. And broad ohio bears it. 'Mid all her young renown. Connecticut hath wreathed it. Where her quiet foliage waves. And bold kentucky breathed it hoarse. Through all her ancient caves. Wachuset hides its lingering voice. Within its rocky heart. And alleghany graves its tone. Throughout his lofty chart. Monadnock on his forehead hoar. Doth seal the sacred trust. Your mountains build their monument. Though ye destroy their dust"

Lights up the breakfast table

lowlands of holland,"On the night that I was married. And upon my marriage bed. There came a bold sea captain. And stood at my bedhead. Saying, ""arise, arise, young wedded man. And come along with me. To the lowlands of Holland. To fight the enemy"". Now then, Holland is a lovely land. And upon it grows fine grain. Surely 'tis a place of residence. For a soldier to remain. Where the sugar cane is plentiful. And the tea grows on the tree. Well, I never had but the one sweetheart. And now he's gone far away from me. I will wear no staysail around my waist. Nor combs are in my hair. I will wear no scarf around my neck. for to save my beauty there. And never will I marry. Not until the day I die. Since these four winds and these stormy seas. Came between my love and I."

When everybody knew your name. They all knew your name. Born wild like a prairie flower. She was sown by the wind and blown for miles. Kansas couldn't keep the child. Hell-bound for the great white way. For the tawdry-bawdy burlesque stage. And wichita was miles and miles away. Everybody knew your name. Everybody knew your name. They knew your name. So you burned the candle. Burned it at both ends. So love ends in scandal. You burned it brief; you burned it bright. And the light in your immortal eyes. Is the light that will never die. Christened in straight-up gin. Pandora was born in weimar berlin. And that was the rise before the fall!. Everybody sat in the dark, dark, black as night. Everybody wanted to go where the light was so bright. And your shining face was gonna lead the way. Homecoming like a heroine-bride. But the honeymoon was over before you arrived. And now they all cursed your name. Everybody cursed your name. Cold winds of gotham howled. And the princess pawned her celluloid crown. In the glass castle walls. Where nobody knew your name. Nobody knew your name"

And I felt his sweet breath. 'You may keep your penny. And your apricot tree. And I'll bring your presents. Back from sea. '. O the ship dipped down. On the rim of the sky. And I waited while three. Long summers went by. Then one steel morning. On the white quay. I saw a grey ship. Come in from sea. Slowly she came. Across the bay. For her flashing rigging. Was shot away. All round her wake. The seabirds cried. And flew in and out. Of the hole in her side. Slowly she came. In the path of the sun. And I heard the sound. Of a distant gun. And a stranger came running. Up to me. From the deck of the ship. And he said, said he. 'O are you the boy. Who would wait on the quay. With the silver penny. And the apricot tree?. 'I've a plum-coloured fez. And a drum for thee. And a sword and a parakeet. From over the sea. '. 'O where is the sailor. With bold red hair?. And what is that volley. On the bright air?. 'O where are the other. Girls and boys?. And why have you brought me. Children's toys? '"

owensboro,"Well, I lived in a town. Way down south. By the name of Owensboro. And I worked in a mill. With the rest of the â€œtrashâ€. As weâ€™re often called. As you know. Well, we rise up early. In the morning. And we work all day real hard. To buy our little meat and bread. Buy sugar, tea, and lard. Well, our children. Grow up unlearned. With no time to go to school. Almost before they learn to walk. They learn to spin and spoon. Well, the folks in town. They dress so fine. And spend their money free. But they would hardly look. At a factory hand. Who dresses like you or me. Would you let them wear. Their watches fine. Let them wear their gems. And pearly strings. But when that day. Of judgement comes. Theyâ€™ll have to share."
photograph,"I found this photograph,. Underneath the broken picture glass. Tender face of black and white,. Beautiful, a haunting sight. Looked into an angel's smile,. Captivated all the while. From the hair and clothes she wore,. I'd place her in between the wars. Was she willing when she sat. And posed the pretty photograph?. Save her flowering and fair,. The days to come, the days to share. A big smile for the camera,. How did she know?. The moment could be lost forever. Forever more. I found this photograph,. Stashed between the old joist walls,. In a place where time is lost,. Lost behind, where all things fall. Broken books and calendars,. Letters script in careful hand,. Music too, a standard tune by. Some forgotten big brass band. From the threshhold what's to see. Of our brave new century?. The television's just a dream,. The radio, the silver screen. A big smile for the camera,. How did she know?. The moment could be lost forever. Forever more. Was her childhood filled with rhymes,. Stolen hooks, impassioned crimes?. Was she innocent or blind. To the cruelty of her time?. Was she fearful in her day,. Was she hopeful, did she pray?. Were there skeletons inside,. Family secrets, sworn to hide?. Did she feel the beat that stirs,. The fall from grace of wayward girls?. Was she tempted to pretend,. The love and laughter, 'til the end?"

Though you made it clear from the very start. there was no trusting you with my foolish heart. Though you maybe made it clear. that didn't make it right. So you really think you'll get away. You can't escape my justice 'till my dying day."

Let the youth of America mourn. Include him in their prayers. Let his image linger on. Repeat it everywhere. With candles and flowers. He was one of ours. One of ours. Why don't you let him be?. He's gone. We know. Give his mother and his father peace. Your vulture's candor. Your casual slander. You murder his memory. He's gone. We know. It's nothing but a tragedy. Lay to rest your soul. and body. Lay beside your name. Lay to rest your rage. Your hunger and amazing grace. With candles and flowers. You were one of ours. One of ours. I saw cameras expose your life. I heard rumours explode with liES. I saw children in tears. Cry and crowd around the sight. Of where you had collapsed that day. Where your last breath and word. Had been sighed. Where your heart had burst. Where you had died. I saw how they were lost and grieving. All half believing you were gone. The loss and the pain of it. Crime and the shame of it. You were gone. It was such a nightmare raving. ""How can we save him. From himself""."

the blind men and the elephant,"It was six men of indostan. To learning much inclined. Who went to see the elephant. (Though all of them were blind). That each by observation. Might satisfy his mind. The first approached the elephant. And happening to fall. Against his broad and sturdy side. At once began to bawl. ""God bless me! But the elephant. Is very like a wall! "". The second, feeling of the tusk. Cried, ""ho! What have we here. So very round and smooth and sharp?. To me 'tis mighty clear. This wonder of an elephant. Is very like a spear! "". The third approached the animal. And happening to take. The squirming trunk within his hands. Thus boldly up and spake. ""I see, "" quoth he, ""the elephant. Is very like a snake! "". The fourth reached out an eager hand. And felt about the knee. ""What most this wondrous beast is like. Is mighty plain, "" quoth he. ""'Tis clear enough the elephant. Is very like a tree! "". The fifth who chanced to touch the ear. Said: ""e'en the blindest man. Can tell what this resembles most. Deny the fact who can. This marvel of an elephant. Is very like a fan! "". The sixth no sooner had begun. About the beast to grope. Than, seizing on the swinging tail. That fell within his scope. ""I see, "" quoth he, ""the elephant. Is very like a rope! "". And so these men of indostan. Disputed loud and long. Each in his opinion. Exceeding stiff and strong. Though each was partly in the right. And all were in the wrong!. Moral. So oft in theologic wars. The disputants, I ween. Rail on in utter ignorance. Of what each other mean. And prate about an elephant. Not one of them has seen!"

As the organ-grinder began to play. ""Over the hills and far away. "". With a fiddle-de-dum and a fiddle-de-dee. Oh, I looked at him and he winked at me. And my heart was light and the day was fair.

Till I shed a tear and so did he. And both of us thought of our supper that lay. Over the hills and far away. Then the dancing bear he took my hand. And we hurried away through the twilight land.

the gulf of araby,"Words and music by Katell Keineg. If you could fill a veil with shells from Killiney's shore. And sweet talk in a tongue that is no more. If wishful thought could bridge. The Gulf of Araby. Between what is. What is. What is. And what can never be. If you could hold the frozen flow of New Hope Creek. And hide out from the one they said you might meet. If you could unlearn all the words. That you never wanted heard. If you could stall the southern wind. That's whistling in your ears. You could take what is. What is. What is. What is. To what can never be. One man of seventy whispers free at last. Two neighbors who are proud of their massacres. Three tyrants torn away in a winter's month. Four prisoners framed by a dirty judge. Five burned with tyres. Six men still inside. And seven more days to shake at the great divide. . The Gulf, the Gulf of Araby. The Gulf, the Gulf of Araby. Well, we would plough and part the earth to bring you home. And harvest every miracle ever known. If they laid out all the things. That these ten years want to bring. We would gladly give them up. To bring you back to us. O, there is nothing we would not give. To kiss you and believe you can take what is. What is. What is. To what can never be. One man of seventy whispers not free yet. Two neighbors who make up knee-deep in their dead. Three tyrants torn away in the summer's heat. Four prisoners lost in the fallacy. Five, on my life. And six, I'm dead inside. And seven more days to shake at the great divide. The Gulf, the Gulf of Araby."

the land of nod,From breakfast on through all the day. At home among my friends I stay. But every night I go abroad. Afar into the land of nod. All by myself I have to go.

Knowing you brought me pleasure. How I'll often treasure. Moments that we knew. The precious. The few.

Our conflicts here though great may be. Shall not prevent our victory. If we but watch and strive to pray. Like soldiers in the good old way. O good old way how sweet though art. May none of us from thee depart. But may our actions always say. We're marching in the good old way
the peppery man,"The peppery man was cross and thin. He scolded out and scolded in. He shook his fist, his hair he tore. He stamped his feet and slammed the door. Heigh ho, the peppery man. The rabid, crabbed peppery man!. Oh, never since the world began. Was any one like the peppery man. His ugly temper was so sour. He often scolded for an hour. He gnashed his teeth and stormed and scowled. He snapped and snarled and yelled and howled. He wore a fierce and savage frown. He scolded up and scolded down. He scolded over field and glen. And then he scolded back again. His neighbors, when they heard his roars. Closed their blinds and locked their doors. Shut their windows, sought their beds. Stopped their ears and covered their heads. He fretted, chaffed, and boiled and fumed. With fiery rage he was consumed. And no one knew, when he was vexed. What in the world would happen next. Heigh ho, the peppery man. The rabid, crabbed peppery man!. Oh, never since the world began. Was any one like the peppery man"
the sleepy giant,"My age is three hundred and seventy-two. And I think, with the deepest regret. How I used to pick up and voraciously chew. The dear little boys whom I met. I've eaten them raw, in their holiday suits. I've eaten them curried with rice. I've eaten them baked, in their jackets and boots. And found them exceedingly nice. But now that my jaws are too weak for such fare. I think it exceedingly rude. To do such a thing, when I'm quite well aware. Little boys do not like being chewed. And so I contentedly live upon eels. And try to do nothing amiss. And I pass all the time I can spare from my meals. In innocent slumber - like this"
the walloping window blind,"A capital ship for an ocean trip. Was the walloping window blind. No gale that blew dismayed her crew. Or troubled the captain's mind. The man at the wheel was taught to feel. Contempt for the wildest blow. And it often appeared when the weather had cleared. That he'd been in his bunk below. The boatswain's mate was very sedate. Yet fond of amusement too. And he played hopscotch with the starboard watch. While the captain tickled the crew. And the gunner we had was apparently mad. For he stood on the cannon's tail. And fired salutes in the captain's boots. In the teeth of a booming gale. The captain sat in a commodore's hat. And dined in a royal way. On toasted pigs and pickles and figs. And gummery bread each day. But the rest of us ate from an odious plate. For the food that was given the crew. Was a number of tons of hot cross buns. Chopped up with sugar and glue. We all felt ill as mariners will. On a diet that's cheap and rude. And the poop deck shook when we dipped the cook. In a tub of his gluesome food. Then nautical pride we laid aside. And we cast the vessel ashore. On the gulliby isles, where the poohpooh smiles. And the anagzanders roar. Composed of sand was that favored land. And trimmed in cinnamon straws. And pink and blue was the pleasing hue. Of the tickletoeteasers claws. We climbed to the edge of a sandy ledge. And soared with the whistling bee. And we only stopped at four o'clock. For a pot of cinnamon tea. From dawn to dark, on rubagub bark. We fed, till we all had grown. Uncommonly thin. Then a boat blew in. On a wind from the torriby zone. She was stubby and square, but we didn't much care. And we cheerily put to sea. We plotted a course for the land of blue horse. Due west 'cross the peppermint sea"
the worst thing,"So you're in love, that's so good for you.. Live it up girl 'cause it never lasts long.. It's heaven for now but not for long.. It's gonna hurt you, it's going to make you feel so bad.. Once I could love, I could trust, I could not doubt. But that was just about the worst thing that I could do.. It was just about the worst thing that I could do.. Maybe not now, but it won't take long. Before it's gonna hurt you and truly do you some harm.. Once I was open, could hope, I had no doubt. but that was the worst thing that I could do.. It was just about the worst thing that I could do.. Once I came close to that most elusive fire burning with hopeless love and desire. But it was just about the worst thing that I could do.. It was just about the worst thing that I could do.. En el pasado estuve ciega como tu.. Atrapada y perdida como tu.. Embelesada y suspendida en mi jaula de plata.. Esos recuerdos te acompanaran toda la vida.. (In the past I was blind as you. Trapped and lost like you with no escape. Suspended in my silver cage.."
thick as thieves,"Remember how it all began. The apple and the fall of man. The price we pay. So the people say. Down the path of shame it led us. Dared to bite the hand. That fed us fairy tale and moral end. Wheel of Fortune. Never turns again. Never turns again. The worst of it has come and gone. And the chaos of millenium. And the falling out of the doomsday crowd. Their last retreat is moving slow. They burn their bridges as they go. The heretic is beautified. Teach the harlot's child to smile. Rocked again by indecision. Should we make that small incision. Testify to the bleeding heart inside. We cut, we scratched, we rend, we slashed. And when he opened up at last. Found a cul de sac. Deep and black. Smoke and ash. Deep and black. Smoke and ash. The wicked king of Parodies. Kissing all his enemies. On the seventh day. Of the seventh week. Tyrant's voice is softened now. But just for one forgiving hour. Before the rise of his. Iron fist again. Fist again. I've come tonight. I've come to know. The way we are. The way we'll go. And to measure this. Width of the wide abyss. I come to you in restless sleep. Where all your dreams turn bittersweet. With voodoo doll philosophies. Day glow holy trinities. The crooked raft that leaves the shore. Ferries drunken souls aboard. Pilgrims march to Compestelo. Visions of their saint in yellow. Follow deep in trance. Lost in a catatonic dance. Know no future. Damn the past. Blind, warm, ecstatic. Safe at last."
this house is on fire,"This house is on fire. Kick off your boots, come sit a spell. Listen to me worry, come and listen well. All you better best come and lean in boys. I don't dare to raise my voice. I've been sitting here for the longest time. reading all the warning and all the danger signs. I don't have the gift of prophesy. telling everybody how it's gonna be. Soon come, soon come the day. this tinderbox is gonna blow in your face. I don't have the gift of prophesy. telling everybody how it's gonna be. You go passing wrong for right. and right for wrong. people only stand for that for just so long. It's all gonna catch like a house on fire. spark an evil blaze and burn higher. Well, I don't have the gift of prophesy. telling everybody how it's gonna be. You go passing wrong for right. and right for wrong. people only stand for that for just so long. I don't have the gift of prophesy. telling everybody how it's gonna be. There's a wild fire catching. in the whip of the wind. that could start a conflagration like there has never been. This house is on fire."
to sir with love (feat. michael stipe),Those. Schoolgirl days. Of telling tales. And biting nails. Are gone. But in my mind. I know. That they. Will still live. On and on. But how. Do you thank. Someone. Who has taken you. From crayons. To perfume. It isn't easy. But I'll try. If you wanted. The sky. I would write. Across the sky. In letters. That would soar. A thousand feet high. To sir. With love. The time has come. For closing books. And long. Last looks must end. And as I leave. I know. That I am leaving. My best friend. A friend who taught me. Right from wrong. And weak from strong. That's a lot to learn. What. What can I give you. In return. If you. Wanted the moon. I would try. To make a start. But I. Would rather you. Let me give. My heart. To sir. With love. If you. Wanted the world. I'd surround it. With a wall. I'd scrawl. These words. With letters. Ten feet tall. To sir. With love
topsyturvey-world,If the butterfly courted the bee. And the owl the porcupine. If churches were built in the sea. And three times one was nine. If the pony rode his master. If the buttercups ate the cows. If the cat had the dire disaster. To be worried by the mouse. If mama sold the baby. To a gypsy for half a crown. If a gentleman was a lady. The world would be upside-down!. If any or all of these wonders. Should ever come about. I should not consider them blunders. For I should be inside-out!
vain and careless,"Lady, lovely lady. Careless and gay!. Once when a beggar called. She gave her child away. The beggar took the baby. Wrapped it in a shawl. ""Bring her back, "" the lady said. ""Next time you call. "". Hard by lived a vain man. So vain and so proud. He walked on stilts. To be seen by the crowd. Up above the chimney pots. Tall as a mast. And all the people ran about. Shouting till he passed. ""A splendid match surely, "". Neighbours saw it plain. ""Although she is so careless. Although he is so vain. "". But the lady played bobcherry. Did not see or care. As the vain man went by her. Aloft in the air. This gentle-born couple. Lived and died apart. Water will not mix with oil. Nor vain with careless heart"

when they ring the golden bells,"There's a land beyond the river. That they call the sweet forever. And we only reach that shore by faith's decree. One by one we'll gain the portals. There to dwell with the immortals. When they ring the golden bells for you and me. Don't you hear the bells now ringing. Don't you hear the angels singing. 'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee. In that far off sweet forever,. Just beyond the shining river. When they ring the golden bells for you and me. We shall know no sin or sorrow. In that heaven of tomorrow. When our hearts shall sail beyond the silvery sea. We shall only know the blessing. Of our Father's sweet caressing. When they ring the golden bells for you and me. Don't you hear the bells now ringing. Don't you hear the angels singing. 'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee. In that far off sweet forever. Just beyond the shining river. When they ring the golden bells for you and me. When our days shall know their number. When in death we sweetly slumber. When the King commands the spirit to be free. Nevermore with anguish laden. We shall reach that lovely Eden. When they ring the golden bells for you and me. When they ring the golden bells for you and me."
where i go,"Climbing under. A barbed wire fence. By the railroad ties. Climbing over. The old stone wall. I am bound for the riverside. Well I go to the river. To soothe my mind. Ponder over. The crazy days of my life. Just sit and watch the river flow. Find a place. On the riverbank. Where the green rushes grow. See the wind. In the willow tree. In branches hanging low. Well I go to the river. To soothe my mind. To Ponder over. The crazy days in my life. Watch the river floe. Ease my mind and soul. Where I go. Well I go to the river. From time to time. Wander over. These crazy days in my mind. Watch the river flow. Where the willow branches grow. By the cool rolling waters. Moving gracefully and slow. Child it's lovely. Let the river take it all away. The mad pace, the hurry. The troubles, the worries. Just let the river take them all away. Flow away."
which side are you on ?,Come all you good workers. Good news to you iâ€™ll tell. Of how the good old union. Has come in here to dwell. Which side are you on boys?. Which side are you on?. My daddy was a miner. Heâ€™s now in the air and sun. Heâ€™ll be with you fellow workers. Until the battleâ€™s won. Which side are you on boys?. Which side are you on?. They say in Harlan County. There are no neutrals there. Youâ€™ll either be a union man. Or a thug for J. H. Claire. Which side are you on boys?. Which side are you on?. Oh workers can you stand it?. Oh tell me how you can. Will you be a lousy scab. Or will you be a man?. Which side are you on boys?. Which side are you on?. Donâ€™t scab for the bosses. Donâ€™t listen to their lies. Poor folks ainâ€™t got a chance. Unless they organize. Which side are you on boys?.
wonder,"Doctors have come from distant cities just to see me. Stand over my bed, disbelieving what they're seeing. They say I must be one if the wonders of God's own creation. And as far as they see they can offer no explaination. Newspapers ask intimate questions, want confessions. They reach into my head to steal the glory, of my story. They say I must be one if the wonders of God's own creation. And as far as they see they can offer no explaination. Chorus:. Oooh I believe, that Fate smiled and Destiny,. Laughed as she came to my cradle. ""Know this child will be able"". Laughed as my body she lifted,. ""Know this child will be gifted, with love, with patience,. and with faith, she'll make her way, she'll make her way"". People see me, I'm a challange to your balance,. I'm over your heads how I confound you,. and astound you to know I must be one if the wonders of God's own creation. And as far as you see you can offer no explaination. Oooh I believe, that Fate smiled and Destiny,. Laughed as she came to my cradle. ""Know this child will be able"". Laughed as she came to my mother. ""Know this child will not suffer"".
