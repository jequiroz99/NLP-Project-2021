Jonny Greenwood's part is played up an octave (courtesy of a capo),. and should be available from most other ""Street Spirit"" tabs. It is. basically a variant, less-intricate picking of the same chord shapes. of the main guitar part. I have no idea what Ed O'Brien does during. this song.. Street Spirit is based almost entirely upon three base chords. -- Am, Em and C. They are spiced up with ornamentations, and are played. as follows:. . Am riff. E-|---------0---------------0---------------0-----------------------|. B-|-----------------3---------------1---------------0---------------|. G-|-----2-------2-------2-------2-------2-------2-------2-------2---|. D-|---------------------------------------------------------2-------|.

G-|-----0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0---|. D-|---------------------------------------------------------2-------|. A-|-3---------------------------------------------------------------|. E-|-----------------------------------------------------------------|. . If you have a decent ear and an intelligent mind, you should be able to. figure out when they are played and for what duration :) The only. change occurs in the final segment, beginning with the lyrics: ""Immerse. your soul in love."" In this part, the C is replaced with a C/G, and the. E minor becomes an E major. They are played as follows:. . C/G riff. E-|---------0---------------0---------------0-----------------------|. B-|-----------------3---------------1---------------0---------------|. G-|-----0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0-------0---|. D-|---------------------------------------------------------2-------|. A-|-----------------------------------------------------------------|.

D-|---------------------------------------------------------2-------|. A-|-----------------------------------------------------------------|. E-|-0---------------------------------------------------------------|. . And that's it! Simple, yet mesmerising song. The only part that will be a stumble. is getting the E riff right, which requires a different fingering from the rest.. I play it with my index finger planted on the G-string, using my pinky and middle. finger to do the descending notes on the B-string. Finally, the middle finger moves. at the end to the D-string to get that E on the second fret. Sounds complicated,. but with practice, you'll get it. Enjoy!. ---------------------------------------------------------------. FIG. 1. Am Asus4 Am Asus2. E-|---------0---------------0---------------0-----------------------|.

stupid car,I find it hard. To drive your stupid car. I find it hard. Cause I never get that far. And you put my brain in overload. And I can't change gears. I cannot see the road. You got concrete eyes. And I cannot see your face. And I failed in life. Cause you crushed me with your hands. And you put my brain in overload. I can't change gears. I cannot see the road
subterranean homesick alien,The breath of the morning. I keep forgetting. The smell of the warm summer air. I live in a town. Where you can't smell a thing. You watch your feet. For cracks in the pavement. Up above. Aliens hover. Making home movies. For the folks back home. Of all these weird creatures. Who lock up their spirits. Drill holes in themselves. And live for their secrets. They're all uptight. Uptight.. (x7). I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane. Late at night when I'm driving. Take me on board their beautiful ship. Show me the world as I'd love to see it. I'd tell all my friends. But they'd never believe. They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely. I'd show them the stars. And the meaning of life. They'd shut me away. But I'd be all right. All right... I'm just uptight. Uptight.. (x7)
sulk,"You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back. You just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl. You are so pretty when you're on your knees. Disinfected, eager to please. Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn. God rest your soul. When the loving comes and we've already gone. Just like your dad, you'll never change. Each time it comes it eats me alive. I try to behave but it eats me alive. So I declare a holiday. Fall asleep, Drift away. Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn. God rest your soul. When the loving comes and we've already gone. Just like your dad, you'll never change. Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn. God rest your soul. When the loving comes and we've already gone."
"sunday, bloody sunday (cover u2)","I can't believe the news today. Oh, I can't close my eyes. And make it go away. How long.... How long must we sing this song. How long, how long.... 'cause tonight...we can be as one. Tonight.... Broken bottles under children's feet. Bodies strewn across the dead end street. But I won't heed the battle call. It puts my back up. Puts my back up against the wall. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. And the battle's just begun. There's many lost, but tell me who has won. The trench is dug within our hearts. And mothers, children, brothers, sisters. Torn apart. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. How long.... How long must we sing this song. How long, how long.... 'cause tonight...we can be as one. Tonight...tonight.... Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Sunday, Bloody Sunday. Wipe the tears from your eyes. Wipe your tears away. Oh, wipe your tears away. Oh, wipe your tears away. (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes. (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). And it's true we are immune. When fact is fiction and TV reality. And today the millions cry. We eat and drink while tomorrow they die. (Sunday, Bloody Sunday). The real battle just begun. To claim the victory Jesus won. On.... Sunday Bloody Sunday. Sunday Bloody Sunday..."
supercollider,Supercollider. Dust in a moment. Particles scatter. Coming up from the soup. Swimming upstream. Before the heavens crack open. Thin pixelation. Coming up from the dust. In a blue light. In a green light. In a half life. In an arc light. I'm a bass bin. Flip-flopping. I'm a pulse wave. Hot-stepping. I put the shadows back into. The boxes. I am open. I am welcome. For a fraction. Of a second. I have jettisoned my illusions. I have dislodged my depression. I put the shadows back into. The boxes. I put the shadows back into. The boxes. I see an angel hanging over the balcony. I see the angels hanging over the balcony

the amazing sounds of orgy,"Don't want to see you smile again. Like diamonds in the dust. The amazing sound of the killing whores. The day the banks collapsed on us.... Cease this endless chattering.

the bends,"Where do we go from here?. The words are coming out all weird. Where are you now when I need you?. Alone in an aeroplane. Falling asleep against the window pane. My blood will THICKEN.. I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain. I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath. And who are my real friends?. Have they all got the bends?. Am I really sinking this low?. My baby's got the bends. We don't have any real friends. I'm lying in a bar with my drip feed on. talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen. And I wish it was the sixties. I wish I could be happy. I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen.. Where do we go from here?. The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear. Where are you when I need you?. They brought in the C.I.A.. The tanks, and the whole marines to blow me away. To blow me sky high.. My baby's got the bends. We don't have any real friends. I'm lying in a bar with my drip feed on. talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen. And I wish it was the sixties. I wish I could be happy. I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen.. I want to live and breathe. I wanna be part of the human race. I wanna live, breathe. I wanna be part of the human race, race, race, race.

the butcher,"Beauty will destroy your mind. Spare the gory details. Give them gift wrapped for the man with everything. Though I lived a lonely life. I was confused. A butcher. I feel nothing. As it courses up my arms in position of the worms. Up, up through my heart and to my brain. I'm a big slab of basic combination cut out. Chopped liver on the block. My heart's still pumping.

They will take me away. And my tenderness I feel. Will send the dark underneath. Will I follow?. Through the glory of life. I will scatter on the floor. Dissappointed and sore. And in my thoughts I have bled. For the riddles I've been fed. Another line is over-oh. White horses. They will take me away. And my tenderness I feel. Will send the dark underneath. Will I follow?.
