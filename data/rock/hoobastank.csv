if i were you,"You seem to find the dark,. When everything is bright. You look for all that's wrong,. Instead of all that's right. Does it feel good to you?. To reign on my parade. You never say a word,. Unless it's to complain.... It's driving me insane. If I were you,. Holding the world right in my hands.. The first thing i'd do,. Is thank the stars for all that I have..

disappear,"There's a pain that sleeps inside. It sleeps with just one eye. And awakens... The moment that you leave. Though I try to look away. The pain it still remains. Only leaving when you're next to me. Do you know that everytime you're near. Everybody else seems far away?. So can you come and make them disappear?. Make them disappear and we can stay. So I stand and look around. Distracted by the sounds. Of everyone and everything I see. And I search through every face. Without a single trace, of the person. The person that I need.

incomplete,"Haven't known you long enough. But now I'm seeing why. You're always on my mind. No one else has ever made me open up my eyes. You're the one that made me realize. Realize. I've been incomplete. Missing a part of me. Blinded by the fear of something new. But now I see. All along what's missing has been you. Try to find the missing piece. To fill a hole in me. A lonely mystery. Thought I had it figured out. But then you came along. And with just a look I knew that I was wrong. I was wrong. I've been incomplete. Missing a part of me. Blinded by the fear of something new. But now I see. All along what's missing has been you. I'm feeling things I never knew existed. And now I know I'll never be the same. This changes everything. Haven't known you long enough. But now I'm seeing why. You're the one that's always on my mind. You're the one that made me realize. Realize. I've been incomplete. Missing a part of me. Blinded by the fear of something new. But now I see. You were all that's missing. And you're here with me. I'm no longer incomplete. I can see the clear and simple truth. For me to be.

can you save me?,I've been here before and I don't like it. I'm trying to find where I went wrong. 'Cause I never want to feel the way I do right now ever again. Totally lost and all alone. Can you save me?. Can you save me from myself?. Cause I've lost it all again. And I think maybe. You're the one who can pull me out. Of the holes I always dig. I said it before and always mean it. I promised this time will be the last. 'Cause just when I thought. That I've come so far from who I used to be. There's no escaping from my past. Can you save me?. Can you save me from myself?. Cause I've lost it all again. And I think maybe. You're the one who can pull me out. Of the holes I always dig. You're the one who can pull me out. One step forward. Two steps backward. One step forward. Two steps backward. Why do I do this to myself?. Can you save me?. Can you save me from myself?. Cause I've lost it all again. And I think maybe. You're the one who can pull me out.

first of me,"I must make a choice. A tough decision. Listen to my voice. Should I give in. To temptation, admiration. One leads to myself. The other some one else. Just an empty shell. Just an empty shell. It's harder than it seems. When you're told that. All your hopes and dreams. Are yours to hold if. You just give them. What's expected. Something they can sell. Put upon a shelf. That I am not for sell. I am not for sell. Chorus:. I hear a voice inside. It's crowning to a scream. I'm not the next of them. I am the first of me. Cause I can live the lie. I am just what you see. I'm not the next of them. I am the first of me. If I can't refuse. The price they offer. I am sure to lose. And I will suffer. Sell my soul to make a profit. All I have to do. Is make believe it's true. That is something I can't do. That is something I can't do. Chorus. So when the waiting is gone. This time to face the truth. You know your good enough. Deep down inside of you. You're finally woken up. If only just to prove. You are born to lead the way. Then be the first of you"
150,"It seems off time again.. I'll let the tapes sync up.. Quick, the walls are caving in.. I'll show you here what I mean with all that's done before the humour met my hurt side.. When four best friends collide the heart is where you go. How was I supposed to know that you couldn't let this go? It seems so separated, but this came together like a wound into the flesh.. It means this is everything.. To measure up the rock to my heart and its percent of me, it's a hundred and fifty.. That's the way it will be for now.. You can't fake this heart, it's not the same to you.. How was I supposed to know that you couldn't let this go. when we said so?. I'm not in debt to any heart other than my own.. This is my medicine, my effort, my home.. I'm not in debt to anyone except myself.. This is my happiness, my sickness, my health."
a thousand words,It's hard to say goodbye. And leave a part of me. These walls will hold so many memories. Underneath my smile. Holding back a scream. Packing up a box of broken dreams. A thousand words. Trapped inside of me. A thousand words. A thousand words. In the rear view mirror. I slowly disappear. All this road the dust they never clear. I wish I had a choice. I wish that I could stay. I wish I had a voice so I could say. A thousand words. Trapped inside of me. A thousand words. A thousand words. A thousand words. Trapped inside of me. A thousand words. A thousand words. A thousand words. Trapped inside of me. A thousand words. A thousand words. A thousand words. Trapped inside of me. A thousand words. A thousand words
a timeless classic,"And so I said “What am I to you? Do you need to think this through?” I’m impatient, and you know me. I’ll be your sun and moon. I’ll be the smile when you enter the room from a long hard day at what you do. When everything we said was nothing that we did, but everything we meant to, we’re through. When it’s over, the heart stops beating. But it isn’t over. You’re really never considered a friend until you roll me over and I stop breathing, and you take back everything that you said. To you, I’m in your bones. I have your back if you’re ever alone. With a knife stuck in it, this blood’s for you. To me, this is love. The only kind that can hang on a rope from above on your ceiling. I want to take back everything we did and everything we meant to do until it hurts you. Or we could just pretend for one second that we’re still friends. Does that even phase you? Does it hurt you? With this mess that you’ve gotten your self into, there’s only room for two. You could close up the tube that leads into my lungs. That could clean up this mess for you. If I stopped breathing and you start feeling, would you be there? Would you understand? Would you see me when I am healing? From this ceiling I could corrupt your plan. It feels so comfortable. Your rope around my throat. From this angle you look so beautiful. Tie the perfect knot. Make it fit just like a glove. To me, this is love."
afterparty at the actor's estate,"We said we meant business and you saw it first hand. The evidence sleeps in ditches, and it’s caked on our hands. The doctor. The broken necks. The archer stands atop the architect and breathes through one last cigarette. He says “Though these weren’t the best of times, we made the best of it, and tonight we’re fingerpainting everything red.” How quickly we forget where we came from. It’s sickening. He better not forget where those stains came from. He says “I remember, but these won’t get the best of me. This is nothing new to me. We’re so strong enough to show them that these are just the moments when friends turn foes. Enemies just cast you off and watch you float away. Go to the house of the actor’s. We’ll drink that blood, and celebrate after we break down that door. Settling the score with a pain that has never been inflicted before.” Those times were too much for me. My heart is so stuck in my throat that my tongue is on my sleeve again. I’ve stepped on so many toes that I cannot keep track of them all. The heart is like a hand grenade. We waited to patiently. Long enough to show them that these are just the moments when friends turn foes. Our enemies will laugh it off and let it go. We write it off as history, but we cannot forget this and you cannot dismiss this. So savour it whole. Don’t question it. The best of times is just two steps away. We’re fingerpainting everything red."
all about you,"I spill out my heart, but you don't hear a word. 'cause you're busy thinking 'bout how long 'til it's your turn.. So you can go on and on about yourself. Go on and on about yourself. And my heart can go back on the shelf. Go on and on about yourself!. But it's not all about you. All about you. The more you speak, the less I care about you, you, you, you. It's not all about you. The world turns without you. The more you speak, the less I care about you, you, you. Whatever I do, you've already done. Only you've done it better and way before anyone.. 'Cause you think that it's some game to win. You think that it's some game to win. Accomplishments and places been. You think that it's some game to win. But it's not all about you. All about you. The more you speak, the less I care about you, you, you, you. It's not all about you. The world turns without you. The more you speak, the less I care about you, you, you, you. Care about you, you, you. You go on and on and on about yourself. You go on and on and on about yourself. The list of who you know. The places that you've been. Well can't you see nobody cares about you. It's not all about you. The more you speak, the less I care about you, you, you, you. It's not all about you. The world turns without you. The more you speak, the less I care about you, you, you, you. Care about you. . 4ª Faixa do CD ""For(n)ever"" de 2009. Enviada por: Lucas Froner"

can i buy you a drink,"Once two individuals walked in a room. One looked at the other but he doesn't know what to do. He'd better figure out his plan so. If he succeeds, he'll get what he needs. So he builds up the nerve to go. And talk to the girl that he's been burning for. And he says, with a slightly boyish grin. I know that this sounds weird, but you've just got to hear. I've got this fantasy, just between you and me. Where we could spend the night and all of the day. Doing all the things I just can't say. And in my fantasy, your kiss is heavenly. So I try to figure out any possible way. To make my fantasy come true one day. She politely denies his invitation. Just then another one hits the floor. One down and one to go. This time he must be smooth, or he'll be pulling root. So he says please. Can I just buy you a drink and I'll show you. That I'll do anything for one kiss. But before let me tell you this."

I wish I could know if the directions that I take. all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing. Show me what it's for. Make me understand it.

did you?,Did you say everything you could?. Do the things that you thought you would?. Did it ever occur to you that this could be your final day?. Did you go where you wanted to go?. Learn about what you wanted to know?. Did you ever really give something back instead of always taking it?. Did you find what your looking for?. Did you get your foot in the door?. Can you look at yourself and feel proud of all the things you've done?. Did you inspire the ones that you knew?. Make a difference to those who knew you?. Did you finally figure out what it is that makes us who we are today?. (Chorus). Don't waste another day. You know I know where you get one. Don't waste another day. To do anything you haven't done.

earthsick,"Rotate your point of view. Concrete surrounds you. It used to be a field where we all played. Suspend your disbelief. This world became a thief. To the beautiful things that flourished in your day. That's why I say. Stop, stop the world I said. Stop, stop, stop the world. Because I want to get off. Want to get off. Want to get off. It's making me earthsick. Substitute what is now for what had used to be. Old or new, everybody's got to pick. It's making me earthsick. My head keeps spinning. Progress is winning. I don't recognize the place where I grew up. This is no fantasy. The ground beneath your feet. Will soon be a store with things that you don't need. That's why I plead."
educated fool,"As I roll over in my bed, the same old thoughts run through my head. What are you getting up for. I look outside, the night still rules, an incarcerated fool. And my prison cell is school. So I open the door to my new day, bad thoughts should go away. But the morning is so grey. How am I supposed to understand a word they're going to say?. My mind's just not awake. Today's the day I break away from this life of monotony. And I arrive and kick my way to class, sit down. Head down on the fake wood. Instructor starts to speak about the time when man was ape. And though I'm trying really hard, my mind won't cooperate. It tells me where I should be, in the sun where life is carefree. That's when I say, can I just go away and learn some other day?. Cause I can't live by the rules established by the school. An educated fool. People always say to me, go to school so you can be. Listen hard and fill your mind's potential, or lack there of. But sometimes I'm not in class just cause that I will not pass. He walks around and stops at me, my letter comes after ""E"". A, D, doesn't matter much to me. A, D, doesn't say shit about me. A, D, doesn't matter much to me. Cause A or D is not me."
end of our rope,"Don't hold back, don't hold us back. From the people we could be. Cause all your rage is jealousy, it's jealousy. So don't let go, don't let them go. And make you feel like it's your fault. Cause if you do they'll never learn, they'll never learn. You don't have to blow my candle out. To make yours look brighter. So save your breath. We always see other's faults, never our own. Soon we'll be dangling from the end of our rope. So what's it for? What's it all for?. I see the artificial you. But underneath the real truth, the real truth. So don't let go, don't let them go. And make you feel like you're all wrong. Cause if you do they'll never learn, they'll never learn. Take a look around at what we've made. Whether we survive is if we change."
escape,"Another day goes without any change. the feeling we live with still remains. we're stuck in a whole and we're searching for anything to hold on to. there has to be somewhere that we can be safe from the lives we live each day. there has to be somewhere that we can be far away...... We have to escape and i will go anywhere if you just lead the way. escape to a place where we'll be together, together everyday. we have to escape..... We could be living how we wanted to. instead of doing things we're forced to do. with no one to tell us that we should be going through what they went through. there has to be someplace that nobody knows, somewhere we can only go. there has to be somplace that we can be all alone........ We have to escape......."

first of me,"I must make a choice. A tough decision. Listen to my voice. Should I give in. To temptation, admiration. One leads to myself. The other some one else. Just an empty shell. Just an empty shell. It's harder than it seems. When you're told that. All your hopes and dreams. Are yours to hold if. You just give them. What's expected. Something they can sell. Put upon a shelf. That I am not for sell. I am not for sell. Chorus:. I hear a voice inside. It's crowning to a scream. I'm not the next of them. I am the first of me. Cause I can live the lie. I am just what you see. I'm not the next of them. I am the first of me. If I can't refuse. The price they offer. I am sure to lose. And I will suffer. Sell my soul to make a profit. All I have to do. Is make believe it's true. That is something I can't do. That is something I can't do. Chorus. So when the waiting is gone. This time to face the truth. You know your good enough. Deep down inside of you. You're finally woken up. If only just to prove. You are born to lead the way. Then be the first of you"
foot in your mouth,"I recognize that typical, cynical smile you wear on the front row. I can hear you telling everyone about the other show. You're the one with all of the friends. But none are real cause you're a hypocrite. Just remember that you did it yourself and you wonder how. Just don't stick your foot in your mouth. Never thought before you spoke. You tell me what I want to hear. Turn around and tell another. Who you think you know. Did you really think it wouldn't get back to me. Fabrications that you spun so well. Always ready with a tabloid story to tell. So don't complain to me. Shut your mouth and go quietly. Cause it didn't have to be like this and you wonder how. Just don't stick your foot in your mouth. Didn't have to be this way. You tell me what I want to hear. Turn around and tell another. Who you think you know. But no one cares what you wanna say. Don't bug me or any other. Shut your mouth and go. How can you live with yourself. Knowing all the lies that you tell. How can you live with yourself. I know what you want and what you'll do. To get your foot in the door or to just break through. But you're never gonna get to where you want right now. Cause you stick your foot in your mouth. All you have to do is change."
from the heart,"There was a time when our dreams felt so real. Just out of reach but not too far to feel. Together we'd finally make them come true. 'Cause anything's possible when I was with you. But they kept on saying we'd never amount to anything..... All of the dreams we built up from the ground. They never believed them they just tore them down. We will rebuild them from the start, we will rebuild them from the heart. 'Cause once all we wanted seemed so far away. But with every step it was closer each day. The more that we tried it was within our grasp. The more that they told us that it wouldn't last. And everyone said we were crazy for giving up everything...."

give it back,We've shared our lives and all of what we know.. But now it seems you don't know me. from the guy next door or the next or the next.... Chorus:. Give it back. you need to give it back..

gona gone gone,"I've been having trouble looking in the mirror?. When I do I can't stand the person that I see. Although my face is still the same. Underneath something has changed. From all the shit you've said and done to me.... Did you ever realize the damage you were doing?. Wee you aware of all the mess that I've cleaned up?. But now I see just who you are. I can't believe it got this far. and it's time to say enough is enough.... I'll be gone, gone, gone.... We started off in heaven. We ended up in hell. So don't waste my time with one more lie. It's too late too apologize. By the time this song is done,. I'll be gone, I'll be gone.. I should have listened when my friends said you were crazy. I should have shown a little spine and self respect,. but I couldn't see the signs. Your so called love had made me blind. Tied me up and left me for dead. Don't beg me to reconsider. Don't bother getting on your knees. 'Cause there's absolutely nothing you can say. to change my mind. So save you breath..."

hello again,"VERSE 1:. I dream. that someday we'll be able to look back. on this to-gether and say. It was for the best and that it. made us stronger to-day. stronger today. CHORUS:. There was more for us to see. a brand new day for you and me. and with confidence I say.

i don't think i love you,"I wonder what you'll take from me today. My sanity or just my breath away. It's hard to say. Impossible for me to tell. We're always walking on eggshells. Who you're going to be from day to day. Today. (Chorus). I wish that we could go back. To what we were before. But I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore. I wonder why it is that you don't see. How much you've changed since we first met. And how much that it's killing me. I know that I will always miss. The butterflies of our first kiss. And how you used to smile so easily. I wish that we could go back. To what we were before. But I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore. It's too hard to keep pretending. It's too hard to ignore. I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never thought that it would come to this. I know we'll never get back to how we were before. 'cause I know that I don't love you anymore. It's too hard to keep pretending. It's too hard to ignore. I know that I don't love you anymore, anymore. I'm sorry"
i felt a song inside me,"I couldn't wait to give you my everything. 'cause this is for real. I've been saving up the things i never say. 'cause this sense of urgency is getting too close to me. And i saved up all the things i never said. Because it's been so long since i felt a song inside me. And i couldn't wait to breathe it and feel it. And we couldn't wait. The days of uncertainty were getting to us. So i'm making up my mind this time, i swear. If you put your trust in me. The words, they will come to me. And i'll shout 'em out aloud for all to hear. I couldn't wait to feel it, repeat it. When i saved up these things i never say. They broke me, killed me and remained locked away. But now i hold thee, now i can't wait to show. So breathe me, feel me, i'll never let you go. Realise it's music in me. I felt a song inside me. And i couldn't wait"
if i were you,"You seem to find the dark,. When everything is bright. You look for all that's wrong,. Instead of all that's right. Does it feel good to you?. To reign on my parade. You never say a word,. Unless it's to complain.... It's driving me insane. If I were you,. Holding the world right in my hands.. The first thing i'd do,. Is thank the stars for all that I have.. If I were you. Look what's around you now,. More than you ever dreamed. Have you forgotten just,. How hard it used to be?. So what's it going to take?. For you to realize. That all could go away,. In one blink of an eye.... It happens all the time. If I were you,. Holding the world right in my hands.. The first thing i'd do,. Is thank the stars above,. Tell the words I love that I do. Yea if I were you,. Whoa, yea if I were you. If I were you, whoaaaa. If I were you. So what's it going to take?. For you to realize. It all could go away,. In one blink of an eye.... It happens all the time!. If I were you,. Holding the world right in my hands.. The first thing i'd do,. Is thank the stars above,. For the ones I love.... Take a breath and enjoy the view. Live the life that I wanted do. If I were you.... If I were you.... If I were you!"
if my tongue could talk,"This tongue in me won't sing, won't speak. These lungs won't breathe. And it's getting to me. Those eyes can't see what's inside me. They try, but they can't get it out. And it burns. And it permeates on the tip of my tongue. Not a liar, though I wish I was one. If I could sing these words, one thing. It burns, it stings. And it's moving through me. So I decide to keep it inside. Hold tight. Hold it 'til it's too late. So spit it out!. As it permeates. As it suffocates me. On the tip of my tongue. As it burns. I can't breathe. So it turns. And it suffocates in what's left of my lungs. And it burns. And it permeates on what's left of the tip of my tongue. Not a liar, though I wish I was one. I can't speak"
if only,"I thought it wasn't wrong,. To hide from you,. simple truth.. I was scared,. I felt it all along,. But it hurt to much for me, to share.. If only I, had been less blind..

Will this pain ever end?. 'cause I don't think I can carry on.. If only I, had been less blind.. I'd have someone to hold on to.. If only I, could change your mind,. If only I had known,. If only I had you.... If only I had you!. If only I had you!. If only I, had been less blind.. I'd have someone to hold on to.. If only I, could have spoke my mind,. If only it were true,.

A lonely mystery. Thought I had it figured out. But then you came along. And with just a look I knew that I was wrong. I was wrong. I've been incomplete. Missing a part of me. Blinded by the fear of something new. But now I see. All along what's missing has been you. I'm feeling things I never knew existed. And now I know I'll never be the same. This changes everything.

My patience is gone and I'm never gonna get it back. Oh, please give it back to me. I wish I was the alligator. I wish I was that strong, but it can't see. So what is it waiting for?.

karma patrol,"Stolen a bike, take it for a ride. Commit a crime, thought you got away. Pick on a kid, only half the size. Karma Patrol's gonna set it straight. Who's to say what's coming or going?. They're the ones who call the shots. And endless search for those who've not. Paid for their delinquent way. Cause personal catastrophes. There's a saying. A little better one than the previous. When you're mischievous. You'll get what you deserve. And it's a beautiful thing. All the liquid coming out the gutter cause. What's done is done. I can't change the past. Karma Patrol is gonna get me (last). Something happened just the other day. You helped another from another. But there's nothing coming back your way. Nobody said that life was fair. So lift your head and understand. That doing good is fine. But don't expect to find your plate full. Because the Karma Patrol is blind to the fact. Except that no one's perfect all the time. Raining down, walking home. When they come, you will know. All looks good, mind your way. Now you're going to pay. (Better watch your back cause). They've got a target on you. No matter what you do. And the water will come down. So jump to the side. Or you'll get soaked straight through. To the bone. That's what they've shown. They have no preference for the good or the evil. But I just know one day. They'll be coming my way."
leave today,"A new day. A new found fire burns inside me, looking up at twenty years that came before me. Careless, cornered looking out. Then it hit me, times are changing, life is ordinary here. Forget our homes, let's leave today. I'm not so bored. With one more chord behind me things will work out fine. The filtered friends, the fake pretending's over, left me just in time. Then she tells me that together there is nothing we can fear. Forget our homes, let's leave today."

look where we are,"I still remember the time,. When this all felt like a dream.. So completely out of reach,. Frustrating.. We kept our nose to the grind,. Make the days turn into weeks.. Hoping time will heal the pain,. Of waiting.. Now it seems so long ago.. Just look back on,. How far we've come.. We've made it somehow,. Look where we are now.. All we've done,. Our battles won.. We've made it somehow,. Look where we are now.. I used to wonder if I,. Would ever have the chance to be,. Something more than what you see.. I doubt it.. We learned to open our eyes,. Now I both think we'd agree, (?). That we're better off than when we started.. There's still so much left to go (?). Just look back on,. How far we've come.. We've made it somehow,. Look where we are now.. All we've done,. Our battles won.. We've made it somehow,. Look where we are now.. And the best is yet to come.. 'cause our story isn't done.. No! No! No! No! No!.

losing my grip,"Another night follows the day. Like a child does to its mother. Everywhere I look I see your face. And all the face of others. And I can not skip the pain. All the questions I went through. I never told myself the truth. I turned my back on you and me. Cause I was scared to see. That we weren't who we used to be. So now I'm.... Trying hard to let go, let you go. But I can't seem to loosen my grip. Trying hard to let go, let you go. Let you go, go. Feeling emptiness inside. A part of me already died. But I pretended to go on. Like everything's ok. And all we built began to fall. As I began to lose it all. Shut my eyes and set me free. Cause I was scared to see. That we weren't who we used to be. So now I'm.... Trying hard to let go, let you go. But I can't seem to loosen my grip. Trying hard to let go, let you go. Let you go, go. You're all that I ever wanted. You're everything that I need. But now it's finally over. Time for goodbyes. I needed so now I'm.... Trying hard to let go, let you go. But I can't seem to loosen my grip. Trying hard to let go, let you go. Let you go, go."
lucky,"I knew how it felt to be another one in need of someone to show the way. Until you saw a part of me that nobody else could see and my life hasn't been the same......

But now it falls right into place when I get to see your face then there's. Nothing that I can't do..... No more dark days, only sun rays. No more hard ways with you today. You make me feel.........."
magnolia,I watch and wonder. As you discover. I'm hoping that I find. Something that reminds me of myself. And I keep hearing. How these days are fleeting. So I try to lock away. Every memory.

There never is enough. Magnolia. Magnolia. These days won't last forever. Magnolia. Magnolia. So the moments we're together. Mean everything. It's like there's no one around. When you're holding my hand in a crowd. It's like there's no one around. When you're holding my hand in a crowd. No one. And I know there'll be a day. I'll be giving you away.

my prescription,"This is all it takes to inspire. Light it up, the fire. Let it burn inside of the brain. When I fall, I can take that fire and become the prior as the flames melt off the pain. So tonight we’ll cut up the tile and do it in style. Close to me, we’ll smoke ourselves to sleep. These songs, my friend are my prescription. This is the way I deal with everything. It’s more than this to me. If you hold it against me, I will hold it against you. If this is your night I can help you sleep. So go on. Before you run and hide, I’ve taken it in stride. I’ve burned you something new. You can take this with you. You can keep that with you so you can hear those songs while you’re alone. You’ll say that “this is the way I deal with you so deal with it.” The record in the player was Caution. So don’t stop. This next one could make my blood curd. Lie awake. Let it break through the skin and then slip into the bloodstream. This is my song."

paper promises,"We were once so good together. So close we couldn't see what's up ahead. Another one will give you pleasure. Then you'll turn your back on me. Don't tell me lies, I've heard them all before. You're never gonna change. Don't tell me why, I'm not interested in. What you have to say. Now trouble seems to seek you out. Attracted by the void that's left in you. So when you've had enough of living without. I hope you'll look within. But you won't so. You take one step forward and two steps back. But this time you're all on your own. Prove to me that I'm not wasting time on you. And all your paper promises. When you say that you've had enough. With all the trouble that you've been facing.

papercuts and exit wounds,"This papercut is so far from deep, but just deep enough to cause it to bleed. While this kind of pain helps you to sleep, it’s what I wake up to and why I scream. When separation becomes routine I turn the page and start over again. This frustration, as you can see, is what I’m becoming accustomed to. Now I come in peace to let you know what that was for me. So pass your time passing out and passing on the torches. Forgetting all the sources of your smile. It takes some time, but look around and find a shoe that fits you. It probably won’t hit you for a while. Just take a step back and watch me bleed. Watch as it runs down my legs to the feet. At any time now this blood red sea will soak you and drown you. I hope you can swim, for this is no ship or rescue team to save you from you. Just understand where we stand. This corrupts your plan to be fair and a friend. Wake up. Morning. Shower. Start Again. Do this alone. Alone I miss my friends. Don’t you miss your home? The home is where the heart is. In the night I had a dream. And in it you stood tall. So save you from you. Remember that we miss you, and don’t forget the sources of your smile."

Tonight we take back the throne.. It's a thing that we promise, so throw it into the air and let it go.. 'Cause you're better off to know than to never know.. So watch me go. So watch me go. Let this be my will and testament, and these words my epitaph.. This stage, my home. Fucking taste it and savor it.. This transfer, my insides to your bones.. You feel it. Into the temples and down to the toes.. It's a thing that we promise, so throw it into the air and let it go.. 'Cause you're better off to know than to never know.. So watch me go. So watch me go. This is for every heart we broke.. This is for every skull that we smashed in.. This is for every floor we soaked.. This is for blood, for sweat and for passion.. It's a thing that we breathe.

Come to think of it, to be honest, to be honest it's a thing that you need,. but it's a thing that you'll never ever know.. You should have listened when we said so..

red sky at dawn,"Courage. Through the rain, with love as our anchor. There’s just enough here to show us the courage that courses through the veins. Knock it down like a bridge. Set it up like a prechorus. These are the tales that our grandfathers tell to their young. Now we’re lost. This ship is no such place for heathens and harbingers. It’s a shame, son. This is the line that you crossed. It’s the fine line that separates caskets from carpenters. I wish we’d wash our hands of this and watch you drift away. We need the last word. Don’t let him go. He seems to be getting away. Ready? Aim. Fire. Go for the throat. Don’t be surprised if he already knows how numbered his days are and how fast we’ll pull the plug on this three-ring circus. I swear. Son, this is business. If you betray us, all traitors are fit with cement shoes. Tonight when you sleep with the fishes, you can measure the tides as your heathen embraces you. Once we’ve washed our hands of this we’ll watch you float away. This is what happens when your friends turn their backs. Now we turn the table. This is your well-deserved revenge. Get used to this. Find a stronger ship. You’re the one that’s sinking. It’s a lonely trip when you’re the one not thinking. The current’s too slow, but steady. Pushing you away, disturbing its flow and burning. You’ll become one with the waves. This is so pure. This is banishment forever. Have you lost your way? The red sun is over the horizon as we drink to the future. Here’s to everything after the sun sets tonight. I’ll see you, far from sober. We’ll watch you as you sink. We’ve drank the last of the rye. As sure as the sun sets tonight I’ll see you south of the Cape of True Love. On the floor of the Ocean of Friendships. I’ll see you in hell if that’s what you want me to do. It’s ironic sometimes how we meet our demise. As the fishes feast out of the backs of your eyes, let this tale be a lesson in life. You only get back what you give, son. Fuck you."

reset the breaker,"Who wrote the rules?. I'd like to know. Did they live it or laugh it off and let it go?. Did they break down? Did it show?. As their light was slipping away. See the trends sink with the sun. See the old friends. They're packing up and moving on. And time will tell, 'cause time only knows. It eats at your seams just to see if you'll let it go. Save us all, darkness breaks through the afternoon. Like no other, light is slipping away from us. Could you reset the breaker?. Reset the breaker. I broke the rules and boy, does it show. And I'm so ready, so say goodbye and watch me go. To this great uncharted unknown. That sleeps in these sheets and repeats in me ever so slow. I'm alone.

running away,I don't want you to give it all up. and leave your own life collecting dust. and I don't want you to feel sorry for me. you never gave us a chance to be. And I don't need you to be by my side. and tell me that everythings all right. I just wanted you to tell me the truth. You know I'd do that for you. So why are you running away?. Why are you running away?. I did enough to show you that. I was willing to give and sacrifice. and I was the one who was lifting you up. when you thought your life have had enough. When I get close you turn away. nothing that I can do or say. so now I need you to tell me the truth. you know I would do that for you. So why are you running away?. Why are you running away?.

same direction,Whenever I step outside. Somebody claims to see the light. It seems to me that all of us. Have lost our patience. Cause everyone thinks they're right. And nobody thinks that there just might. Be more than one road to our final destination. But I'm not ever gonna know. If I'm right or wrong. Cause we're all going in the same direction. And I'm not sure which way to go. Because all along. We've been going in the same direction. I'm tired of playing games. Of looking for someone else to blame. For all the holes in answers that are clearly. showing. For something to fill the space. Was all of the time I spent a waste. Cause so many choices point the same way I was. going. But I'm not ever gonna know. If I'm right or wrong. Cause we're all going in the same direction. And I'm not sure which way to go. Because all along. We've been going in the same direction. Going in the same direction. Same direction (same direction). So why does there only have to be. One correct philosophy. I don't want to go and follow you. Just to end up like one of them. And why are you always telling me. What you want me to believe. I'd like to think that I can. Go my own way and meet you in the end. Go my own way and meet you in the end. I'm not ever gonna know. If I'm right or wrong. Cause we're all going in the same direction. And I'm not sure which way to go. Because all along. We've been going in the same direction. Going in the same direction. Going in the same direction. Same direction (same direction)

silence is bliss,"I don't understand why anyone would do this. Not only kill another, but help them build excuses. More police control, more oppression of our rights. A call to arms, a reason to fight. Power to repress, to kill without evidence. Supported by the public via mind control in the press. Keep your eyes open wide. When truth speaks, there's nothing to hide. Inside. Believe what papers say. Go on about your day, no matter what they say to us. It's going on: World War III, mass destruction. Take care where you stand. Take care who you kill. It's you who is inciting fear to abide. If I keep this locked inside. In my country I confide. No way that he can hide from us on this crusade. It's been played, and I don't want to fight. Retract your rage. Act your age. No war we wage is worth it. Television station reaches more than we can teach. Domestic deception. In this 'operation' try to practice what you preach. We say this, but we sit still. Watching it burn right before our eyes. Silence is bliss."

That's me, all up in space. Waking up in another place. Where I hit the lights and I fall asleep for days. When you fall, you know. It only hurts if you let it. And I didn't let it. And in the end I'll drink myself to sleep. It's just the beginning. This is just the beginning. My chemicals and me are going places. My chemicals and me, they sing songs. They sing me to sleep.

subways in pittsburgh,"So tense, so strong when subtleties are solemn spoken and seldom. So this beat will keep going on whether you pass out or I'm drunk in Bristow. I'm sorry, but where were you when all we had was topsoil? For friends in need, just take heed and knock it all down. I'll build it up. Sometime you'll see this, somehow you'll know. Some day someone will say ""I told you so."" Is this what you believe? Is this what you wanted to receive? So you can learn how to think properly, when logic and reason shall repeat. Is this what you believe? Good luck so far, but Sara warned me about drives like this, they're so... and I know who my friends are. I know my place in this spectrum (where my seats are). I'm sorry, there's certain things I don't discuss at Subways in Pittsburgh or through Buffalo. This ride could last forever. Just take heed and knock it down. I'll smile and build it right back up.

Seasons change. with time, feelings come and go. These things I realize more than you know. I asked her if she missed me. I've been here way too long and Winnipeg has such a history of separating what is tired and true. I'm coming home, there's not one thing you can do, I promise you. When you underrate this power of us, you place it last and place yourself first. When you underrate this power of love, it stays behind and puts everything above. And i cried myself to sleep a million times. Sweet cliches that i scribe are theraputic. Inside it wasn't effort. It was your life and you lived it well. There, I said it. Now gas up your car for this long trip home. I'll go, but not with you."

The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. Defening sound of rain. It's not enough to drown my thoughts. So ease the pain. So instead I'll soak it in. While I stare outside again. So I write your name in my breath on the window. Sit and watch as it fades away. The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. I try so hard but I can't seem to let go. I lost so much when you walked away. The painful memories of the tears of yesterday. The sun just won't seem to come out. Now that you've walked away. Now I cannot escape. I cannot escape the rain.

the critic,So what if what I say. So what if what I do. Isn't what you wanted to. That doesn't justify you. Tearing me down with all that you say. It seems you only live. To doubt my every move. Pretending like you always knew. But I don't care if you don't. Like what you see 'cause I'll do as I please. Chorus:. So leave me alone. I'm sick of your games. When will you learn we're not the same. Leave me alone. Get out of my face. When will you learn we're not the same. No matter where I am. No matter where I go. You never can leave me alone. You might as well just tell me. You're wasting you time 'cause you're gonna fail. And now I finally know. Now I finally see. The reason why you couldn't be. The person that you dreamed of. You gave it all up. Well I wont do the same. Chorus. We're not the same no. Leave me alone. I need more than room to grow. 'Cause we're not the same. You treat my love like it a game. Chorus.

the dance that broke my jaw,"Hey man, I saw you standing there. You were bobbing your head to the beat as your fists. start to clinch. Oh so tight. ""No Fear"" in your eyes, and also on your. shirt (and hat and pants). It's your turn to show tonight, do your best to start. a fight. Show us all that you can dance with your elbows and. your hands. (Dancing with friends, keeping the peace, if you. didn't know I'm being sarcastic). When you feel the crowd start to move. Please try to resist the urge that you get. Try not to get upset and sock your neighbor right in. the face. I know that coach meant well. But what's a dance to you is a fight to someone else. Keep your anger aside, kick back, enjoy the ride. And think how it could be if you showed some courtesy. Your hostility, it grows so easily. You're the next victim of the dance that broke my jaw. Please don't get near. You're the next victim of the dance that broke my jaw. Have some more beer, ""No Fear Gear"" is what. you wear. Just because the music begins. Does not always mean a wrestling scene from WWF. Breaks out right to my left. And I got a ringside ticket. I'll challenge you or anyone anywhere. Sometimes I just want the football thrown in. Let the football game begin. And then say to myself as I think of someone else. That's not what we came here for, we'll take no more. What's going through your head?. To the point that someone is dead. Keep it up and you're out of here, you're out of here. And when you're outside by yourself and sitting all. alone. Keep your head down. Cause we're the ones that warned you. You're the next victim of the dance that broke my jaw. Please don't get near. You're the next victim of the dance that broke my jaw. Can't we just be friends in here?. Go drink some more beer. Kick your neighbor's rear. Elbow to my ear. Can't we just be friends in here?. I was dancing by myself, and bothering no one else. When suddenly I was encountered by the beast. I ask so politely, ""please just let me be"". But the next thing I remember, I'm staring at the. ceiling. Someone please, help me call security. Was on my feet, but now I'm on the floor. That shithead doesn't show respect to me or to you. So now he's out the door. Not gonna hurt us anymore. That dance floor is free of hostility. And I'm so glad he's gone. It's our turn to have fun. My message was clear, ""We're all friends in. here"". But we're not allowed to do the dance that broke my. jaw"
the fallen,"Everything I know will change, I'll never be the same. So I'm told as a voice repeats ""Again, again and again"". What if it doesn't feel like everyone said it should?. What have I become?. How'd I fall so far, now no one can find me. Realise in a moment my ambition is a curse. 'Cause it hides all the best in me, but shows the worst. How'd I fall so far, now no one can find me. How'd I fall so far, now no one can find me. There's nothing behind me, to take me back to start. Can someone remind me, of who that I used to be?. I can't seem to wake up from this dream. I can't catch my breath enough to scream. Be careful what you wish for. 'Cause your wishes may not be what they seem. How'd I fall so far now no one can find me. How'd I fall so far now no one can find me. There's nothing behind me. To take me back to start. Can someone rewind me, to who that I used to be?. To who that I used to be. (What if it doesn't feel like everyone said it should). What have I become?"
the joke and the gentleman,"So pucker up and kiss the ass that you would kill to kick. Because I hate to see you suffer, but it’s the thought of it that keeps my bones thick. I wonder what it takes to be a man. I take a look at my reflection, and then I look at you. I still don’t understand. Suck it up and chill, the beat goes on and on, my friend. I know reality is a bitch, but buddy, where were you when she needed you then? Do I even have to say? Considering everything that you said but not once to me. If we’re taking this to war, I sing a song of battle. I can feel it in my throat, but buddy I’m not wasting all my time. Until then, we’ve got a score to settle. Every promise that you broke will be the words you choke on. If you grow up, I’ll watch my back if you watch where you spit. I’m the king of confrontation, but something tells me that you’re just not worth it. So laugh it off or take your shot. The cuts can hurt so bad. I’m giving this the best I got, ‘cause this is the best I’ve ever had. If anything should happen there’s something you don’t want to witness. This is passion. This is my gut reaction. If anything should happen, son, it’s on. Don’t you forget this. It’s over. Watch your winter turn colder. It’s over, and your December is that much colder."
the lesson,"Now that you've earned yourself a melody I'll sing it out in stereo so you can hear it better. How far will you go to be so fresh and cold? I heard you were dramatic, well I can add to this. Here goes nothing. Remember what you said about our friendship? ""It isn't just a friendship. This means we're friends 'till the end"". See, the end was months ago. I wish I could have been there. I like to tell myself that. You know I'm not afraid of reality because I breathe it every day. It's not a movie. These bones are not afraid to be broken for my friends because I care about them without limits or ends. With that said, you're in a rush, i can see this. Well you can run, I will crawl. I thought I'd seen it all. Will it be there when you fall? Because this filter is the last one of them all, and this fall, I'm realizing I'm not so tall. After the dust has settled, after the blood of friendship has been shed. I'm gonna rise up like an elevator. Take this from my heart, and bury deep inside your head."
the letter,"Meet me there at midnight. Same place we always go. I'm absolutely sure he doesn't know. Those words jump off the letter. That I found behind our bed. Haunting me they echo in my head. In my head. It's too late to try and work it out. There's no way to turn this thing around. It's all there in the letter that I've found. I've memorized it line for line. Too bad that letter isn't mine, no. When can I next see you. I've been counting the days. I promise you our secret will be safe. No I just can't continue. Reading through my tears. The meaning of the letter is so clear. So clear. It's too late to try and work it out. There's no way to turn this thing around. It's all there in the letter that I've found. I memorized it line by line. Too bad that letter isn't mine. You wanted me to find it. Never tried to hide it. Running never fades. those words are here to stay. I hope you find this letter. I'm writing you today. These will be the last words that I say. It's too late to try and work it out. There's no way to turn this thing around. It's all here in this letter that you've found. It's too late to try and work it out. There's no way to turn this thing around. It's all here in this letter that you've found. So memorized it line for line. I won't be there to say goodbye"
the mirror,"Is it shame?. Is it greed?. Is it something that I need?. To make me feel so strong to the other ones. Is it real?. Is it true?. All the trouble I go through. Is it just a way, to show. (Trying so hard, but still I get nothing). That I don't have the strength to show. But the mirror will always know. I've got to let go. Is it them?. Is it me?. I'm just too occupied to see. Afraid to look within to the real one. Can it be that I am scared. To share the parts I've never shared?. Or is it just a way, to show. (Trying so hard, but still I get nothing). You won't get inside my head cause I won't let you go. To see that I'm crying out for you to. Know what I want to say. I've got to let you know. That I want to say. I've just got to tell you."
the pressure,I can still remember when. At the tender age of ten. Mother told me I could be anything at all. Then when I was seventeen. Someone made that choice for me. And if I disagreed. I would end up on the street. Out on the street. We've been told for all our lives. This is who you have to be. Close your eyes go back to sleep. Don't ask questions. Don't ask why. Just do exactly as they say. But I don't think that I can take. The Pressure. The Pressure. Looking back at twenty-one. I just wanted to have fun. But first I had to go make a name for myself. Now lately everywhere I go. Somebody wants to know. If something's wrong with me. Because I'm not like them. I'm not like them. We've been told for all our lives. This is who you have to be. Close your eyes go back to sleep. Don't ask questions. Don't ask why. Just do exactly as they say. But I don't think that I can take. The Pressure. The Pressure. The Pressure. The Pressure. Tired of justifying who I am. I long to ask for something. More than what we've all been told to. Do you think there's something wrong with me. We've been told for all our lives. This is who you have to be. Close your eyes go back to sleep. Don't ask questions. Don't ask why. Just do exactly as they say. But I don't think that I can take. The Pressure. The Pressure.

this is just the beginning,"I’ve been patiently waiting. I can’t think of the words to say. And it’s getting frustrating. This is honestly killing me. I’ve been meaning to ask you. But my awkward tongue gets in the way. There’s a thousand things I want to say. So break some pieces off for me. I can only wait until the end. Go break some pieces off for me. Baby, this is just the beginning. You’ve been watching me waiting. I know you know just what to say. And I’m yours for the taking. Conversation could make my day. But the one complication is your tongue just makes no sense to me. Oh, when we get to the bottom of this. You know I’ll wait forever for this. Trust me. We burn ourselves alive!. I can only wait until when we get to the bottom of this. Go break some pieces off for me. Baby, this is just the beginning"
this is taking forever,"All I wanted from the start was something. I could hold in my hands. And it has got me thinking. All I want now in the end is something. You cannot understand. But now I can't stop thinking. All my patience has been taken,. Breaking a promise and a plan. All I wanted from the start was to savour this moment. This is all I can do. I'm getting to know it, that this is all I can do. I'll get it together. I'm out of control, and all I can do. It's going to get better, this is taking forever. This is taking forever. I tried all the things I could try. Nothing wants to stay in my hands. But I can see the look in your eyes. Watching for my last cries. I'll wipe off your look, yes I can!. All I want now in the end is to savour this moment. And now I know what I'm up against. You want to know what I'm up against?. This is taking forever. Just look at me now. I'm wiping the look from off your face"
this is where we go it alone,"So this is where we go it alone. This is the last thing I was thinking. But I'm cutting the ropes, dropping. The birds above are softly singing. And that's the last thing I remember hearing. Our love was tangled in their ropes. Now this is where we let go. So let go, this is where we go it alone. And this is more than a goal. This is much more than just a mission. Because now I need it more than you know. So give me more than just a listening. As if it were the last thing I remember hearing. As I leave this position. Now this is where we let go. So let go, this is where we go it alone. And the last thing I remember hearing. It was the last thing I remember. So we let go, this is where we go it alone. This is where I let you go"
tin walls,There was a vacancy in the place. Where my dad should be. Do other children feel this way. I cried out so loud for him. Who knows where he could have been. I know that I will not be the same. Take me away from all this pain. Just give me chance to escape these tin walls. Cause I know these walls won't last forever. Some day I'll escape these tin walls. Surrounded but all alone. And trapped by this rootless home. Where will the wind take me today. Cause I was just so confused. With nothing that I could do. I'll show them all I could one day. Take me away from all this pain. Just give me chance to escape these tin walls. Cause I know these walls won't last forever. Some day I'll escape these tin walls. And someday we'll leave this park of decay. When's that day. When will we go. When will I laugh. What will I do. Where will I go when all this is through. When will I laugh. What will I do?. I know it won't last. Know it won't last forever
to be with you,"Make me feel again. Slide across my skin again. Let me uncover you to rediscover you. And I will open up if you promise to give in. On this perfect night. Let the two of us be one.... We will be again another time. No matter what all the others say. Cuz I would leave it all so far behind. Just to be with you today.... So make me feel again. Feel your every breath again. Nevermind everyone. There's only me and you.... We will be again another time. No matter what all the others say. Cuz I would leave it all so far behind. Just to be with you today.... So we will be again another time. And I will do all I need to leave the others. All so far behind. Just so I can be, just so I can be.... With you.... With you.... With you.... With you..."
too little too late,I've been so long in waiting.. Putting my life on hold for this chance to live out my dreams.. You think you know what I should do. with the choices that I know have.. Make them benefit you.. Chorus:. What if I don't want to hear the things you say?. Where were you when I was needy yesterday?. You want in with me. now that it's good. but its too little too late. Time and again I've asked you just for some light to show the way.. I was in total darkness.. You act like I owe you something.. But I don't owe anything to anyone but me.. Have you no dignity?. Chorus x2. Bridge:. I know exactly what I'll do with the advice that you gave.. Watch me throw it all away.. Chorus x2.
tortoise,"It comes just like a comet. I see it, I feel this feeling over me. I'm doing everything to support my each and every dream. And when this dream's this so close to me I can't help but scream that this way's the way for me. I'll make you see that this way's the way for me. I'll make you see what is meant by dedication, you put your heart to something true, these things that mean the world to you. For example, this simple machine means a billion things to me. There's nothing you can do, to stop me or this machine. I'll make you see that this way's the way for me. I'll make you believe. These things we know, take the time to show. This brand new road, this brand new home. Once as a hare, forever the tortoise. This head, safe to see this so far. This heart, safe to take this so far. My protective shell protects my insides from all foul attempts to take this passion."

The life that I am made of. There's nothing left to prove. My heart's forever true!. What is it they're afraid of?. Afraid of.... So what should I do. Just lay next to you. As though I'm unaffected?. And who should I be. When they're judging me. As though I'm unaffected?. Before they even saw my face. They knew that I was not the same. And decided I was not the one for you. For you....

unquestionable,"She said ""So, tell me what you're thinking"". But he don't know, so impressionable. So she let go, and in the art of drinking. He took those signs as something. He said, ""The stupid things you said. Were never meant to make such sense. Don't take this to your head. 'Cause that could be the consequence. And this one, oh"". So she said ""So"", and so he mentioned something. So dead wrong, so questionable. So she said ""Son, is this all that you're thinking?"". And it was far from comfortable. So she said. ""Don't take this to the heart. It never meant to make such sense. When this is just the start. And that was just an accident. But this one, oh. Did you think of that one?"". If every question wasn't questionable. We would ask the unquestionable. If every question wasn't questionable. We would ask these questions. It never meant to make you say that. This is just the start. I never meant to make it stop. Don't take this to the heart. 'Cause that could be the end. Did you think of that one? No. Didn't think of that one.

up and gone,"Staring at the white above. Can't tell if I'm alive or am I dead. Or is it in my head?. Where'd I go wrong. Staring at the white above. One day I closed my eyes and here I am. A cold, unhappy man. I've come to realize the life I have I hate. The pulse I need is slowly fading. Until I've lost it all. I've been waiting for an inspiration. For a chance I never got to take. Before it's much too late. Where'd I go wrong. Where's the boy that used to run?. Could it be he's up and gone away?. He seems so far away. And all the things I could have done. Could it be they've up and gone away?. They seem so far away. It feels as if the boy in me. Has left and been replaced with a cheap and bitter. Imposter of myself. I must find the one that used to be. Approach him slow, don't be afraid to say. ""Can he come out and play?"". Where'd I go wrong. Staring at the sky above. I've found a chance I'm finally going to take. I've learned from my mistakes. Where'd I go wrong."
waiting,"Waiting. i don't care what you think or say, it doesn't matter. what you think it takes, i'm gonna do what i came here. to do, so you'd better move.

we are one,"In your darkest tower. In your time of need. When the only lost around you. Beside you, is not me. We are one. We are everyone. Promise you. I'll never let go. We are one.

we're so beyond this,"All I want is here in my arms tonight. It's killing me. Girl, let me make it right. What you need is more out of me tonight.

what doesn't kill you makes you grow,"Another night alone on a dark road somewhere far away from my home. The summer's on my mind, so far behind. Face in a sink reflects these caffienated insides. It's life scenarios you think of while you're alone, and on my own. Like if my parents paid for everything I own I could be somewhere in a classroom taking notes of things that I already know (or think I do...) What doesn't kill you makes you grow. This nine to five turns into twenty four hours. It seems that sweet escape from this cold, dark prison is a dream. My priorities forgotten. Stuck in a cycle on your knees. I deliver, in spite to my friends and my enemies. Some days, I stay and lie awake in bed just to breathe my quickened heartbeat. I hear noises overhead. This face isn't strong enough to sleep. I have a dream that I can sleep on my own. These days, my pale reflection can't pretend that this is all I have to offer. I hear noises overhead but this throat isn't strong enough to scream. So it seems, 'cause now i scream on my own. This cup of coffee burning my insides, and sip after sip I grow and come to realize that this is moving on."
what happened to us?,I thought it was too good to be true. I found somebody who understands me. Someone who would help me to get through. And fill an emptiness I had inside me. But you kept inside and I just denied. Some things that we should have both said. I knew it was too good to be true. Cause I´m the only one who understands me. What happened to us?. We used to be so perfect. Now we´re lost and lonely. What happened to us?. And deep inside I wonder. Did I lose my only?. Remember they thought we were too young. To really know what it takes to make it. But we had survived off what we have done. So we could show them all that they´re mistaken. But who could have known. The lies that would grow. Until we could see right through them. Remember they knew we were too young. We still don´t know what it takes to make it. What happened to us?. We used to be so perfect. Now we´re lost and lonely. What happened to us?. And deep inside I wonder. Did I lose my only one?. We could´ve made it work. We could´ve found a way. We should´ve done our best to see another day. But we kept it all inside until it was too late. And now we´re both alone. The consequence we pay for throwing it all away. For throwing it all away. What happened to us?. We used to be so perfect. Now we´re lost and lonely. What happened to us?. And deep inside I wonder. Did I lose my only?. What happened to us?. What happened to us?. What happened to us?. What happened to us?
what i meant to say,"Come and watch the sunrise. Watch the sun rise with me. Forget about the last night. and the whole ordeal.. 'Cause I can say some dumb things. Some fucking dumb things - True..

I guess the drinking got me. 'Cause sometimes what I say. it isn't how I really feel.. [Chorus]. What I meant to say last night. is I never want to be without you. Oh...that's what I meant to say..

I won't apologize for who I've come to be. 'Cause who the hell am I if I can't be me?. I've wasted too much time on insecurities. 'Cause who the hell am I if I can't be me?.
